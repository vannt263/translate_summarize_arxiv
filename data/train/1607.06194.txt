    "the assumption that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales is fundamental to modern cosmology .",
    "our current understanding of the universe comes from the vast amount of cosmological observations which are hard to interpret without relying on this assumption .",
    "therefore it is important to verify this assumptions using various observations .",
    "there are a multitude of evidences favouring isotropy such as the isotropy of the cmbr @xcite , isotropy in angular distributions of radio sources @xcite , isotropy in the x - ray background @xcite , isotropy of gamma - ray bursts @xcite , isotropy in the distribution of galaxies @xcite , isotropy in the distribution of supernovae @xcite and isotropy in the distribution of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "but the local isotropy around us alone is not sufficient to assure large - scale statistical homogeneity .",
    "one requires to combine the local isotropy with the copernican principle to infer the large - scale statistical homogeneity of the universe .",
    "the copernican principle states that we do not occupy a special location in the universe which itself requires validation .",
    "one can infer the large - scale statistical homogeneity from local isotropy only when it is assured around each and every point in the universe .",
    "so it is not straightforward to infer large - scale statistical homogeneity of the universe from the local isotropy .",
    "a large number of studies @xcite find that the galaxy distribution behaves like a fractal on small scales but on large - scale the universe is homogeneous .",
    "most of these studies claim to have found a transition to homogeneity on scales @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to these claims a number of studies @xcite reported multi - fractal behaviour on different length scales without any transition to homogeneity out to the scale of the survey .",
    "the results from these studies clearly indicates that there is no clear consensus in this issue yet .",
    "there would be a major paradigm shift in cosmology if the assumption of cosmic homogeneity is ruled out with high statistical significance by multiple data sets .",
    "the most important implication of inhomogeneities comes from the averaging problem in general relativity through their effect on the large scale dynamics known as backreaction mechanism .",
    "the backreaction mechanism is known to cause a global cosmic acceleration without any additional dark energy component @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite is the largest and finest galaxy redshift survey todate .",
    "the quasars are the brightest class of objects known as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the high luminosities of quasars allow them to be detected out to larger distances . the sdss dr12 quasar catalogue provides us an unique opportunity to test the assumption of cosmic homogeneity on the largest accessible scale due to its enormous volume coverage",
    ". the presence of large quasar groups ( lqg ) in the quasar distribution is known for quite some time .",
    "@xcite identified a huge lqg with characteristic size @xmath3 at @xmath4 in the dr7 quasar catalogue and claimed that this structure is incompatible with large - scale homogeneity indicating possible violation of the cosmological principle .",
    "a number of subsequent studies @xcite pointed out some flaws in interpreting lqgs as structures .",
    "however if such structures really exist then they owe an explanation . in the present study we test the large - scale homogeneity in the sdss dr12 catalogue using information theory based methods @xcite .",
    "we do not address the lqgs separately but the presence of any such structures in the quasar distribution are clearly expected to boost the signal of inhomogeneity up to noticeably larger length scales .    throughout our work , we have used the flat @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 .    a brief outline of the paper follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the method of analysis followed by a description of the data in section 3 .",
    "we present the results and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "+     +   +   +",
    "our analysis is based on a method proposed by @xcite and its extension @xcite which used the shannon entropy @xcite to study inhomogeneities in a 3d distribution .",
    "it gives a measure of the average amount of information required to describe a random variable .",
    "the shannon entropy for a discrete random variable @xmath7 with @xmath8 outcomes @xmath9 is a measure of uncertainty denoted by @xmath10 defined as ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath7 .",
    "we first embed the quasar distribution in a @xmath13 three dimensional rectangular grid which divides the entire survey region into a number of regular cubic voxels .",
    "we then identify the voxels which lie partly or completely outside the survey region and discard them to avoid any spurious effects from the boundary .",
    "only the voxels which are fully inside the survey region are retained for the analysis .",
    "the grid size @xmath14 is varied within a suitable range and each choice of @xmath14 result into a different number of voxels and quasars within the survey region .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of voxels with grid size @xmath14 and @xmath16 be the number of quasars inside the @xmath17 voxel .",
    "now if we randomly pick up a quasar it can reside only in one of the @xmath15 voxels i.e. there are @xmath15 possible outcomes as for the position of this given quasar and the probability of finding the aforementioned quasar in voxel @xmath18 is given by , @xmath19 with the constraint @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the outcome of the experiment with a random variable @xmath21 and the shannon entropy associated with the random variable @xmath21 can be written as , @xmath22 where the base of the logarithm is arbitrary and we choose it to be @xmath23 .",
    "we use three different measures of inhomogeneity based on the shannon entropy defined in and describe them in the following subsections .",
    "the probability of finding a quasar in the @xmath17 voxel @xmath24 will have the same value @xmath25 for all the voxels when @xmath16 become the same for all of them .",
    "this is an ideal situation when each of the @xmath15 voxels available contain exactly the same number of quasars within them .",
    "this maximizes the shannon entropy to @xmath26 for grid size @xmath14 .",
    "we define the relative shannon entropy as the ratio of the entropy of a random variable @xmath21 to the maximum possible entropy @xmath27 associated with it .",
    "the relative shannon entropy @xmath28 for any grid size @xmath14 quantifies the degree of uncertainty in the knowledge of the random variable @xmath21 .",
    "equivalently @xmath29 quantifies the residual information and can be treated as a measure of inhomogeneity .",
    "the fact that quasars are not residing in any particular voxel and rather are distributed across the available voxels with different probabilities acts as the source of information .",
    "if all the quasars would have been residing in one particular voxel leaving the rest of them as empty then there would be no uncertainty at all making @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "this fully determined hypothetical situation corresponds to maximum inhomogeneity . on the other hand",
    "when all the @xmath15 voxels are populated with equal probabilities it would be most uncertain to decide which particular voxel a randomly picked quasar belongs to .",
    "this maximizes the information entropy to @xmath32 turning @xmath33 .",
    "as @xmath34 represents a homogeneous distribution we define the entropy deficit @xmath35 to quantify the deviation of the distribution from uniformity . clearly dividing the entropy deficit by @xmath27",
    "provides the relative shannon entropy .",
    "alternatively one can measure the inhomogeneity by using the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence or information divergence @xcite . in information theory kl divergence",
    "is used to measure the difference between two probability distributions @xmath12 and @xmath36 .",
    "+ @xmath37    let @xmath38 be the distribution corresponding to the data for which homogeneity is to be tested and @xmath39 be the distribution for a homogeneous and isotropic poisson random distribution where both of the distributions occupy same 3d volume with identical geometry and are represented by same number of points .",
    "the kl divergence between the actual and random data is then given by , + @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the counts in the @xmath17 voxel for actual data and random data respectively .",
    "we use natural logarithm in .",
    "we use the sdss dr12 quasar catalog which includes @xmath43 quasars .",
    "the data is downloaded from the link http://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/boss-dr12-quasar-catalog .",
    "the quasar target selection is described by @xcite and the data is described by @xcite .",
    "we first exclude the objects with a zwarning value that calls into question the accuracy of their redshift determination .",
    "we apply the criteria zwarning @xmath44 @xcite and then set uniform @xmath45 to identify a homogeneously selected sample of quasars .",
    "this provides the core targets selected using xdqso technique after chunk 12 @xcite and also those which would have been selected by xdqso if it had been the core algorithm prior to chunk 12 .",
    "we apply further cuts in g - band psf magnitude @xmath46 and r - band psf magnitude @xmath47 @xcite to get @xmath48 quasars with xdqso probability greater than @xmath49 .",
    "we then construct our quasar sample covering a contiguous region of right ascension @xmath50 and declination @xmath51 in the redshift range @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting quasar sample does not have an uniform number density in the entire redshift range .",
    "we find that constructing a volume limited sample of quasars from this data results into a sample with a very poor number density .",
    "so to construct a quasar sample we use a cut @xmath53 in the i - band absolute magnitude which varies with redshift .",
    "we describe @xmath54 with a polynomial as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath14 are the coefficients to be determined .",
    "we constrain these coefficients so as to produce a quasar sample with a near uniform comoving number density .",
    "we find that the coefficients @xmath57 produces a quasar sample consisting of @xmath58 quasar which has less than @xmath59 variation ( ) in number density around the mean in the entire redshift range .",
    "the sample has a volume of @xmath60 @xmath61 with a linear extent of @xmath62 in the radial direction .",
    "the mean number density of the quasar sample is @xmath63 .",
    "we construct @xmath64 mock random samples from homogeneous and isotropic 3d poisson point processes .",
    "the mock random samples contain exactly the same number of points as there are quasars in our sample and are distributed within a region which have the same geometry as the quasar sample .",
    "we present our results in . in top",
    "left and middle left panel of the we show respectively the variation of @xmath29 and @xmath35 with increasing grid sizes for the quasar sample and its random mock counterparts . both the quasar sample and the random samples have a mean inter - particle separation of @xmath65 and they are hardly distinguishable below this length scale but as the grid size increases the differences become evident . in both of the plots we find that the quasar sample has a higher information content than the poisson samples throughout the entire length scale ranges due to the gravitational clustering .",
    "however the differences diminish with increasing length scales and at @xmath66 the results for the poisson samples lies within @xmath67 errorbars of the same for the quasar sample .",
    "the residual inhomogeneities beyond @xmath1 are consistent with what one would expect for a homogeneous poisson point process .",
    "we show the rates of change of @xmath29 and @xmath35 in the quasar sample with increasing length scales in the top right and middle right panels of respectively .",
    "we find that the rates of change for both of the measures in the quasar sample diminish nearly to zero with tiny errorbars at @xmath68 . in the bottom left panel of we",
    "show the kl divergence measure as a function of length scales in the quasar sample .",
    "the kl divergence also indicates that the inhomogeneities diminish with increasing length scales finally reaching a plateau at @xmath66 .",
    "however it is worth mentioning here that though the entropy is sensitive to the higher order moments of a distribution it may not capture the signatures of the full hierarchy of correlation functions .",
    "a minkowski functional analysis of sdss lrgs by @xcite find significant deviations from the @xmath5cdm mock catalogues on scales of @xmath69 .",
    "it has been suggested that the quasars inhabit dark matter halos of constant mass @xmath70 from redshifts @xmath71 ( the peak of quasar activity ) to @xmath72 and their large scale linear bias evolves from @xmath73 at @xmath74 to @xmath75 at @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "our quasar sample extends from @xmath77 to @xmath78 for which we expect a large scale linear bias of @xmath79 . as the quasars inhabit rarer high density peaks one would expect the quasar sample to be homogeneous on even larger scale than the sdss main galaxy sample and the lrg sample .",
    "our result is consistent with our earlier studies on the sdss main galaxy sample @xcite and the lrg sample @xcite for which we find a transition scale to homogeneity at @xmath80 .",
    "it may be noted here that there are @xmath81 independent voxels ( bottom right panel of ) at grid size of @xmath1 and each voxel is expected to host @xmath82 quasars provided the distribution is homogeneous beyond this length scale .",
    "this number is certainly very small due to the small number density of the quasar sample .",
    "further we can not have access to spatial hypersurface of constant time .",
    "so any analysis of homogeneity on large scales would unavoidably incorporate some signatures of the time evolution . despite these difficulties it is interesting to note the degree of homogeneity in the quasar sample beyond a length scale of @xmath1 .",
    "last but not the least we prepare @xmath83 different quasar samples with different set of values for the coefficients @xmath84 used to define the limiting magnitudes at different redshifts .",
    "irrespective of our choice we find the same transition scale to homogeneity in each of these quasar samples .",
    "we finally conclude that the sdss quasar distribution is homogeneous beyond @xmath1 , for the information theoretic measures employed in this paper .",
    "the authors would like to thank the sdss team for making the data publicly available .",
    "b.p . would like to acknowledge iucaa , pune and cts , iit kharagpur for the use of its facilities for the present work ."
