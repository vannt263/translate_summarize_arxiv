    "hexagons are a very common planform arising in pattern - forming systems .",
    "the asymmetry between the centres and the edges of the hexagons leads to a favouring of hexagonal patterns in situations where there is intrinsic asymmetry , such as in bnard - marangoni convection  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite where the top surface of the convecting layer is free and the bottom surface is in contact with a rigid boundary .",
    "most natural systems will have some degree of asymmetry , and hence hexagons are widely observed , not only in convection experiments , but also for example in vibrated granular layers  @xcite  @xcite and during directional solidification  @xcite .",
    "triangular patterns are more unusual , but are seen in some systems , such as vibrated granular layers  @xcite .",
    "cross and newell  @xcite pioneered a method of describing the behaviour of a fully nonlinear roll pattern in an extended system by following the evolution of the local phase , and hence the wavevector , associated with the roll pattern as it varies in space and time .",
    "this method was further developed by passot and newell  @xcite who regularised the cross - newell equations outside the region of roll stability , introducing an order parameter equation to account correctly for the behaviour of the pattern in regions where the amplitude is small .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to apply ideas similar to those of cross & newell  @xcite and passot & newell  @xcite to the evolution of fully nonlinear hexagonal and triangular patterns in large aspect ratio systems , such as those seen in experiments on rayleigh - bnard convection in @xmath0 near the thermodynamical critical point  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows :  2 presents a method of deriving the cross - newell equations for triangles and hexagons in a general real gradient system .",
    "the cross - newell equations for particular complex gradient systems are derived in  3 for hexagons and  4 for triangles .",
    "the case of free hexagons and triangles is discussed in  5 , and the general nongradient case in  6 .",
    "section 7 concludes and indicates some directions for future investigation .",
    "it is assumed that fully developed hexagons or triangles can be described by a stationary solution @xmath1 of an equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are linear and nonlinear operators respectively , at least one of which is differential , with variational structure such that [ gov ] dx dy w_t = - dx dy g w , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are real .",
    "hexagons and triangles are described by three wavevectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 forming a resonant triad such that @xmath10 . in the case where the governing equations force this resonance to be maintained",
    ", the pattern can be described using two phases @xmath11 and @xmath12 associated with two of these wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "for fully nonlinear triangles and hexagons , the hexagon amplitude and the total hexagon phase @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 ) are determined adiabatically from the two phases @xmath11 and @xmath12 except in the vicinity of defects where the amplitude is small or when the driving stress parameter of the system is close to the critical value for pattern formation so that the amplitude is small everywhere . in the ` free ' case discussed in  5 , where the resonant triad may be broken , the hexagon amplitude is slaved to the three independent phases @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath17 , except when the amplitude is small .    in a large aspect ratio system , the size and orientation of the hexagons will typically change slowly in space and time . to describe these changes , it is convenient to introduce large scale phases @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the inverse aspect ratio of the box , and slow space and time scales @xmath21 , @xmath22 . the local wavevectors are then given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
