    "in the next years , the first generation of large interferometric gravitational - wave detectors @xcite should reach a sensitivity good enough to expect the first direct detection of gw signals . in parallel of the experimental work consisting in operating the detectors at their working point with background noises as small as possible , the future data analysis methods are being prepared for the various expected sources of gw , each of them requesting specific tools . yet , the wiener filtering is used in most of these fields due to its optimal characteristics for signals whose time evolutions are known . indeed , it is not only the filter giving the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) among all the linear ones @xcite but it has also the property of having the lowest false dismissal rate for a given false alarm rate among all filters @xcite .",
    "conversely , its main drawback is its poor robustness : as soon as the physical signal and the filter do not match exactly , the snr can be dramatically reduced . even if the searched waveform is analytically computed with high precision",
    ", it always depends on a vector of parameters @xmath3 whose values are specific to a given source and thus unknown ",
    "e.g. its mass , the main frequency of emission ...  and whose accurate estimation is indeed a major aim of the data analysis .",
    "the set of physically possible values for the vector @xmath3 is the continuous parameter space @xmath4 .",
    "a given filter can only be efficient  i.e. recovering a large fraction of the snr  in a restricted region of this space , called the efficiency area .",
    "therefore , many different templates must be used in parallel for a matched filtering procedure , in order to cover the whole parameter space .",
    "the lattice must be dense enough to ensure a minimal loss in snr for any real signal whose parameters do not exactly match any of the available filters , while the number of templates @xmath0 must be kept small to limit the computing power needed for the analysis .",
    "given these two requirements , it clearly appears that the choice of the set of templates is very important as it has major consequences on both the ultimate filtering performances and its feasibility . on the other hand ,",
    "tiling @xmath4 is most of the time very difficult as the efficiency area @xmath5 of a filter depends on @xmath3 and on the minimal match @xmath1  see section [ subsection : formalism ] .",
    "thus , in the general case , uniform coverage is not possible .    in the one - dimensional case ( @xmath6 )",
    "the tiling is easy as the efficiency areas are straight segments of various lengths which can be aligned one after the other one  see e.g. @xcite where the matched filtering with gaussian peak templates ( only depending on their width ) is studied .",
    "as soon as @xmath7 , one has to cope with overlaps , holes and borders .    the problem of computing a set of templates for matched filtering purpose has already been studied for the compact inspiralling binaries search .",
    "the gw signal is accurately estimated thanks to various development methods ",
    "taylor @xcite or pade @xcite post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions  and both the estimated snr and the event rate make such events good candidates for a first detection . if the spins are neglected and the orbit circular , the parameter space is two - dimensional ( the two masses of the stars ) and the number of templates can be very high @xcite if the low mass region is included in @xmath4 .    using the formalism defined in ref.@xcite ,",
    "owen and sathyaprakash present a method @xcite to cover this parameter space at the 2 pn order . to solve the question of placing new filters with respect to the previous ones",
    ", rectangles inscribed inside the efficiency areas are used instead of the real ellipses , bigger but more difficult to place accurately ",
    "i.e. without holes .    in this paper , a different tiling approach is studied for the case @xmath8 .",
    "the main idea is to construct the lattice of filters with an iterative method ensuring a ( rather optimal ) _ local _ template placement .",
    "the location of the first ellipse center is arbitrary and chosen by the user .",
    "then the procedure goes on and new ellipses increasing the coverage of @xmath4 are added one after the other . when it stops , the tiling of the full parameter space is normally complete  @xmath4 fully covered  but is certainly not optimal from the _ global _ point of view .",
    "as described in section [ section : tiling_details ] , the overlapping in the final configuration can be so important that a large fraction of ellipses are in fact completely covered by other ones and thus useless for the detection purposes , while wasting computing time .",
    "therefore , a second step is then started to clean the list of templates by selecting these ellipses and erasing the corresponding filters . in the end ,",
    "the final set of templates  all useful  only depends on the position of the first filter in the parameter space from which the locations of all the other ones have been iteratively computed . due to border effects which can not be properly estimated ,",
    "it is impossible to define the best initial position .",
    "so , a last trick to further decrease the number of templates is to merge some sets of templates corresponding to different starting points and to apply to the full list the reduction procedure previously mentioned .    as our team",
    "is mostly involved in the search for gw bursts ( short gw signals usually lasting a few milliseconds for which waveforms can not be predicted as accurately as for coalescing binaries , emitted by e.g. supernovae or the merging phase of compact stars inspiralling one around the other ) , this algorithm was originally developed to search for damped sine - like signals .",
    "indeed , such time - behavior can be seen in a large fraction of supernova explosion gw signals computed numerically ",
    "see e.g. the waveforms of ref.@xcite  and is also expected to occur when excited black holes come back to equilibrium @xcite . the latter case will be used in the following as a benchmark of the tiling method performances ; details are presented in section [ section : damped_sine ] .",
    "another interesting feature of this example is that the number of templates remains small even when the allowed mismatch loss of snr @xmath9 is kept very low .",
    "thus , it is possible to check the quality of the tiling ( with respect to the prescription originating the tiling method ) and to see how the characteristics of the set of templates evolve when @xmath1 changes . this experience may be very useful for the inspiralling binaries search whose tilings can not be tested so easily  yet , they must show similar behaviors .",
    "in particular , the most significant result we obtain is that one should be able to reduce the constraint on the template spacing while keeping small the mean false dismissal rate of events , ultimately the only important quantity in the search of rare signals occurring at random time .",
    "therefore , a much less numerous set of filters would still be efficient enough , but at a smaller computing cost .",
    "after the introduction of some hypothesis and useful notations , the main steps of the tiling method are presented .        as a linear filtering",
    "consists in correlating the detector output @xmath10 with the corresponding filtering function @xmath11 , one defines the following scalar product to represent the filtering operation :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the one - sided power spectrum density and the `` @xmath14 '' symbol means fourier transform .",
    "the normalization is chosen so that , in case of signal alone , @xmath15 is equal to the snr .",
    "if one now assumes that @xmath11 is almost monochromatic signal of frequency @xmath16 , one can show that if the noise spectrum is nearly flat around @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : inner_product_frequency ] ) becomes approximately equal to the following equation :    @xmath17    as the definition of the ambiguity function involves normalized templates ",
    "see section [ subsubsection : ambiguity ]  , the frequency - depending factor @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "thus , representing the filtering operation by a scalar product in the time domain is in fact accurate also with a colored noise for signals with a narrow extension in the frequency domain",
    ". this will be approximately the case for the damped sine waveforms ",
    "see ref.@xcite for a detailed discussion  which will be used to test the tiling algorithm in the next sections .",
    "the ambiguity function @xmath19 between two templates @xmath20 et @xmath21 is defined by :    @xmath22    the templates are normalized : @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath19 is thus a measurement of the closeness between two templates .",
    "it can also considered as a way to see how well the template @xmath20 can be used to detect the signal @xmath21 : the ambiguity function is the mean fraction of the optimal snr achieved at a given distance in parameter space .",
    "following ref.@xcite , if @xmath24 is small enough , the ambiguity function can be approximated by a second order power expansion ",
    "the first order is null as the expansion is performed around the absolute maximum of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath25    with @xmath26 defining a metric on the parameter space @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "finally , one defines the minimal match @xmath1 as the lower bound of the recovered snrs , which means that the loss of the snr due to the mismatch between the template and the signal must be kept below @xmath9 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , one can note that with this definition , a  of course _ pessimistic _  estimator of the fraction of false dismissals @xmath27 is :    @xmath28    for instance , with @xmath29 , one has @xmath30 .",
    "this value of @xmath1 is usually found in the literature as the correspondence with this particular value of @xmath27 is easy .",
    "this quantity @xmath1 is the only input parameter of the tiling procedure ; it allows one to define precisely the efficiency area @xmath31 of the template @xmath20 by the following equation :    @xmath32    the area of @xmath4 including all the vectors @xmath21 which match this inequality is the inner part of an ellipsoid centered on @xmath3 whose proper volume scales as @xmath33 .",
    "the average fraction of recovered snr for physical signals with parameters belonging to @xmath31 is at least equal to @xmath1 .      tiling the parameter space consists of finding a set of @xmath34 filters",
    "@xmath35 so that the union of the surfaces @xmath36 completely covers @xmath4 .",
    "the aim is to achieve this task by using as few templates as possible to keep the computing cost manageable .",
    "to do so , one has to solve two related questions :    * which tiling algorithm to use ? * how to test its quality ?",
    "the main problems encountered by any tiling procedure are : overlapping , gaps , areas lost beyond the physical parameter space ... the difference between the ellipsoid and the real border of the efficiency area is not really taken into account : in practical cases for one - step searches , @xmath1 is close to 1 and thus the ellipsoid is assumed to be a good approximation of the ambiguity surface .",
    "moreover , the overlapping between close ellipses is an advantage to discard such a problem .",
    "in fact , the tests of the sets of templates constructed with the tiling method presented below show that the tilings have no significant holes , even with the choice @xmath37 , which validates a posteriori this hypothesis . clearly , the value of @xmath1 from which the ellipsoid approximation of the efficiency area is no longer valid depends on the precise tiling problem considered .",
    "it is well - known that the optimal tiling of an infinite plane by identical disks of radius @xmath38 consists in placing their centers on an hexagonal lattice , separated by a distance of @xmath39  see figure [ fig : optimal_circle_tiling ] . in this way",
    ", the overlapping is minimized and the ratio @xmath40 between the sum of the disk areas and the surface effectively covered is    @xmath41    this value would increase in any real situation due to the border effect .",
    "this property of circular tiling is used by the algorithm on the following way .",
    "once the location of a template @xmath42 in @xmath4 has been chosen , one computes its efficiency area @xmath43 . through a simple plane transformation",
    ", @xmath43 becomes a circle @xmath44 of unit radius and the six neighbor centers are placed on the regular hexagonal lattice previously described .",
    "this choice is nearly optimal if the shape of the efficiency areas is slowly varying with respect to their characteristic dimensions . using the inverse transformation ,",
    "the six new center positions are given in @xmath4 .",
    "then , each ellipse associated with a new center is tested in order to check if it covers a part of @xmath4 not already covered by the previously defined ellipses . if the ellipse is useful , its center is added to the center list and will be used later to place other centers .",
    "for example , we have found that with @xmath29 only about 20% of the centers are kept .",
    "this iterative algorithm stops either when the full surface of the parameter space is covered or when no new ellipse can be placed any longer",
    ".      a successfully completed coverage computed with the former procedure can be usually redundant in the sense that a large fraction of ellipses are completely covered by others . to save computing time",
    ", useless templates need to be identified and deleted . like for the first step of the algorithm",
    ", one has to face the problem that erasing an ellipse is a local operation which can have global consequences : which template should be discarded first ?    to answer this question , the following procedure has been set :    * for each ellipse @xmath45 belonging to the tiling , one defines its _ utility _ @xmath46 which is the fraction of @xmath4 it covers alone .",
    "useless ellipses are thus characterized by @xmath47 . * among those ellipses , the one with the smallest area in the parameter space is dropped .",
    "this prescription is consistent with the idea that it is a priori better to keep big ellipses which have a higher potential of coverage .",
    "of course this general rule may not always be true but it looks reasonable . * utilities are then updated for the surrounding ellipses as they become more `` useful ''  @xmath46 locally increases .",
    "then , this scheme is iterated until all the remaining ellipses have non zero utilities .",
    "this second step of the tiling algorithm is very important : for most of the simulations in the damped sine case , the number of templates is reduced by a factor of about two with respect to the first list .      finally , the output of the whole procedure is a set of templates completely covering the parameter space and which depends on only one initial condition , that is the location of the first filter set at the beginning of the tiling generation .",
    "once more , this choice may have global consequences on the tiling quality  for instance , shifting it horizontally/vertically may cause a column / line of templates to appear or vanish  but can not be simply optimized .",
    "therefore , tilings starting at different points on the parameter space are computed in parallel ; then , all the lists of templates are merged in a single one .",
    "finally , the cleaning procedure is applied to this clearly redundant set of filters to obtain the final lattice of templates .",
    "thanks to this last step , its size is decreased by 10 or 15% with respect to the individual coverages in the damped sine case .    in the damped sine case",
    ", five different tilings have been merged together to compute the final lattice of templates .",
    "there seems to be a good compromise between gain in the number of templates and computation time ( more than 80% of the ellipses of the full list are useless and so the cleaning procedure is much longer ) .",
    "this last merging step doubles the total computation time of the tiling , i.e. its duration is of the same order of magnitude as the sum of the computation times for the initial tilings .",
    "three variables can be used to control the quality of the tiling .    * the number of templates @xmath0 . * the ratio @xmath48 between the sum of all the ellipse areas and the parameter space surface . * the ratio @xmath49 between the sum of all the ellipse areas inside @xmath4 and the parameter space surface .",
    "one has clearly @xmath50 .",
    "these two estimators allow to measure the overlapping between templates and the fraction of extra area outside the parameter space , while @xmath0 can be compared with its estimation computed by integrating the proper volume of the parameter space . due to the imperfections of the real tiling ( overlapping , border effects ... ) and to the fact that the analytical computation of the template numbers is only approximative by principle , it is interesting to check the consistency of the two numbers .",
    "an excited black hole , born e.g. after a supernova collapse or the merging of two compact objects , comes back to a stationary state by emitting gw .",
    "this emission can be described as a superposition of black hole quasi - normal modes @xcite .",
    "the dominant mode is expected to be quadrupolar with the longest damping time @xcite . in order to limit the number of free parameters defining the matched filtering parameter space",
    ", one assumes that after some transitory phase the waveform becomes ( with a proper choice of time origin ) :    @xmath51    it was observed @xcite that a given couple @xmath52 is connected to one single set of physical parameters @xmath53 , the mass and the reduced angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "moreover , the corresponding relation can be expressed analytically with a 10% precision @xcite . introducing the quality factor @xmath54 , one has in geometrical units ( @xmath55 ) :    @xmath56\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the normal mode frequency is , as expected , a decreasing function of the black hole mass , increasing with the rotation parameter as the quality factor , which is also independent of @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , detecting such gw signal would give direct physical information on its source .",
    "following ref.@xcite , two different methods estimating the optimal snr give identical results :    * a calculation in the direct space assuming that the noise is white at the oscillation frequency ; * computing the fourier spectrum and approximating it by a dirac at the oscillation frequency .",
    "one has finally    @xmath58    where @xmath13 is the one - sided power spectrum density of the noise .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on the physical process at the origin of the black hole formation . for high mass inspiralling binaries",
    ", it can be very large @xcite and leads to detections at cosmological distances , while for supernova collapses , it can be high enough to be detected in the local group @xcite .    using this framework ,",
    "it is sufficient to study the two quadratures and to compute the corresponding sets of templates covering the two dimensional parameter space @xmath59 .      as in the black hole oscillation case",
    ", no correlation is assumed between the oscillation frequency @xmath60 and the quality factor @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 is rectangular :    @xmath62 \\ ; \\times \\ ; \\left [ f_{\\text{min } } \\ , ; \\ , f_{\\text{max } } \\right ] \\ ] ]    its borders are chosen in the following way :    * for q , by using the black hole normal mode range + @xmath63 * for f , by using the interferometric detector main characteristics + @xmath64    the mismatch between two templates of parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) can be written )  there is a factor 2 between the ellipse coefficients and the metric ones : @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . ]    @xmath70    with @xmath9 being the maximal expected loss in snr .",
    "the dimensionless coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 only depend on the quality factor @xmath61 .",
    "their expressions are the following :    * for pure damped cosines : @xmath74 * for pure damped sines : @xmath75    in the former case , assuming that the quality factor is much greater than 1 , the first order expansion of these coefficients in power of @xmath61 gives the results computed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath76 is not valid in the total range @xmath77 $ ] we have considered in this paper and the difference between the real coefficients and their first order approximations can reach 10% in the region of low quality factor .",
    "the number of templates needed to cover the parameter space can be roughly estimated by the usual formula : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the template proper volume and @xmath80 is the metric determinant . as @xmath81 , we can express this number with the help of @xmath1 : @xmath82    from equation ( [ eq : nb_templates ] ) , it is possible to estimate the numbers of templates @xmath0 needed to cover the parameter space .",
    "one gets at the first order in q : @xmath83 for the two families of signals studied .",
    "the number of templates is logarithmic in the frequency band and scales linearly in the quality factor range . with the numerical border values",
    "previously defined , one gets @xmath84 .",
    "the expressions giving the coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 clearly show a dependence on the ellipse location in the parameter space .",
    "using the vocabulary of differential geometry , this is a strong indication that @xmath4 is curved .",
    "following ref.@xcite , it is possible to verify this by calculating the curvature of the search manifold . as the waveform is a function of the parameters @xmath85 only , we have a two dimensional problem and can thus calculate the gaussian curvature , @xmath86 , directly . following the petrov classification , the riemann tensor @xmath87 associated with the metric defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) has only one independent component , which we can take to be @xmath88 , in its fully covariant form .",
    "we can thus define the gaussian curvature on the search manifold by @xmath89 where @xmath80 is the metric determinant . for the damped sine case for instance ,",
    "the gaussian curvature is constant over @xmath90 : @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the search manifold has the same topology as a 2-sphere .      as the template tilings appear to be very similar for the damped cosine and sine signals ",
    "compare for instance the expressions giving the coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73  , we mainly focus on the latter in the following .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table ix : template numbers and fraction of events lost for tilings with different values of the minimal match parameter @xmath1    table ix shows the results achieved for the case of sine filters with @xmath1 values between 85% and 97% .",
    "the evolution of the tiling characteristics with respect to @xmath1 can also be seen on figure [ fig : tiling_characteristics ] . for each value of the minimal",
    "match , a procedure similar to the @xmath29 case has been followed : computation of 5 different tilings corresponding to different starting points and then merging of the template lists to reduce the number of filters needed .",
    "the first thing to note is that @xmath0 clearly decreases with @xmath1 and follows quite perfectly the expected behavior ",
    "( [ eq : nb_templates ] ) . with respect to the theoretical number of templates",
    ", @xmath0 is slightly larger , due to border effects .",
    "yet , they affect in the same relative way the tilings corresponding to different values of the minimal match and so the relation @xmath92 is preserved .",
    "the top graph of figure [ fig : tiling_characteristics ] shows this relation ; the line corresponds to the best linear fit computed with the available data .",
    "one gets : @xmath93    the slope of the function is of the same order of magnitude as the estimated value given by eq.[eq : n_owen ] : @xmath94 .",
    "the second result  and perhaps the most important  is that even with @xmath95 the estimated fraction of lost events is smaller than the expected 10% , as shown on the bottom graph of figure [ fig : tiling_characteristics ] . with a template number reduced by a factor of 3 ,",
    "the parameter space coverage remains well inside the initial specification : @xmath96 .",
    "it is only with the choice @xmath37 that @xmath97 slightly exceeds 10% , but with a reduction of a factor 4 in the number of templates .",
    "numerically , one obtains    @xmath98    this feature is of small importance here as the total number of templates @xmath0 is only a few hundred but would be essential for the compact inspiralling binaries searches . in this case , for a total mass of two solar masses , the number of templates is expected to be close to @xmath99 or even more depending on detector bandwidth ",
    "see e.g. ref.@xcite . any tiling method based on the minimal match criterion like",
    "the one developed in this paper should provide a set of templates able to recover on average a fraction of snr much better than @xmath1  the _ minimal _ match indeed  , and thus miss less events than assumed during the building phase of the lattice .",
    "therefore , by using a monte - carlo study of the generated tiling performances , it should be possible to decrease by a large fraction the number of templates really needed to guarantee that for instance 90% of the events potentially detectable will be seen .",
    "such a refinement appears to be a way to save a large amount of computing time and would simplify any data analysis strategy based on matched filtering methods .      as known since many years",
    ", mean losses in snr recovery are well below @xmath9 , which indeed implies that the mean fraction of lost events is much smaller than @xmath2 . in the previous section , the evolution of @xmath100 was shown to be also well - fitted by a power law @xmath101 , with the exponent @xmath102 .",
    "it would be interesting to see if such dependences could be analytically foreseen , without any simulation and without any assumption on the tiling problem .",
    "let us consider first the simpler case of a single parameter @xmath103 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "one then assumes that the match is well approximated by its quadratic expansion around a given template located at @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the efficiency area @xmath5 is bounded by the equation :    @xmath105    with",
    "@xmath1 the minimal match and @xmath106 the metric coefficient .",
    "@xmath5 is a segment @xmath107 $ ] with @xmath108 . assuming a uniform distribution of physical signals in this area , it is easy to compute the mean fraction of recovered snr :    @xmath109    with @xmath29",
    ", one gets @xmath110 which is very close to the value of @xmath111 achieved in our simulations .",
    "it is worth noting that the result is independant of @xmath106 ( and so of the particular efficiency area considered ) , which validates the assumption of computing the mean value of the fraction of snr recovered .",
    "one can estimate @xmath112 in the same way :    @xmath113    the choice of @xmath29 gives @xmath114 , while with @xmath115 , one has @xmath116 .",
    "these values exceed the results of the numerical simulations ( respectively 2.6% and 10.7% ) but are quite comparable .",
    "how do these results change with a two - dimensional parameter space @xmath117  which is indeed the situation considered in this article ? by a proper choice of coordinates , one can  like for the 1d - case  assume that the chosen template is located at @xmath118 and that the efficiency area is defined by the equation of an ellipsoid written in its simplest form :    @xmath119    straightforward calculations allow one to compute both the mean fraction of recovered snr @xmath120 and the mean loss of events @xmath112 :    @xmath121    like for the one - dimensional case , these expressions do not depend on the particular template and are thus estimators of the mean values of these quantities . with @xmath29 ,",
    "one gets values higher than those computed numerically : @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between these numbers and those given in the case @xmath6 is higher , even if the tiling studied here is 2-dimensional .",
    "the effect of the overlap between close templates for @xmath124 has been checked with the fully simplified model presented in figure [ fig : optimal_circle_tiling ] : efficiency areas are identical disks of a given radius . in this case , a more accurate expression of @xmath125 can be computed analytically by selecting for each physical signal the closest template , i.e. the one allowing to recover the highest fraction of snr . but",
    "the gain is very small : the fraction of false dismissals decreases only by about 1 - 2% and remains in all cases higher than for the 1d - model .",
    "in fact , one could not expect much more from this refinement .",
    "figure [ fig : optimal_circle_tiling ] shows that only a fraction ( @xmath126 ) of the physical signals are affected by this improvement and that these particular signals have the worst matches .",
    "finally , it appears that the good performances in detection efficiency of the template bank are the consequence of two aspects : firstly , the parameter space considered in this study is much more complex than the ideal case of a parameter space where one could use a uniform lattice of templates , and secondly the generated tilings remain redundant despite all the steps used to reduce it as much as possible .",
    "there is certainly still room for future improvements for the geometrical tiling algorithm .",
    "the comparison of the numerical data with the analytical parameterization computed for the model @xmath124 ( 2d ) is also shown on figure [ fig : tiling_characteristics ] . on this plot , it is clear that it overestimates the snr losses with respect to the simulated tiling performances ; yet , it gives values closer to real data than the @xmath2 curve .",
    "thus , the fractions of false dismissals are also higher .",
    "this paper presents a method to tile any two dimensional parameter space @xmath4 with a given maximal loss in snr .",
    "the template list is build in two steps : the first one is an iterative algorithm which provides a complete coverage of @xmath4 without any area left uncovered .",
    "as the computed set of filters can be redundant , a second step including two cleaning steps allows one to significantly decrease the number of templates by dropping those which are useless .",
    "this algorithm has been used for the lattice of templates needed to look for damped sine signals with matched filtering .",
    "even if the number of filters involved is by some orders of magnitude below those computed for the inspiralling binaries search , this choice of waveform allowed us to strongly test the capability of the algorithm as the ellipse characteristics show large variations in @xmath4 or , equivalently that @xmath4 is curved .",
    "moreover , the algorithm using these templates can be directly implemented in an on - line filtering .    as it is not possible to choose the optimal tiling of a given parameter space , the final configuration of filters is computed by mixing various sets of templates computed with different initial conditions ( the location of the initial filter used to develop the iterative algorithm ) and by applying to the global list the reduction procedure .",
    "this kind of average decreases the number of filters by about 15% with respect to an unique procedure .",
    "the number of templates finally computed is comparable to the analytical estimations and monte - carlo simulations show that the set of filters fulfills the initial requirement : minimizing the loss in snr in the whole parameter space .    in the damped sine case",
    ", the study of the sets of templates shows that the effective loss of events @xmath97 ( as a function of @xmath1 ) is much less than its usual estimation : @xmath97 approximately behaves as @xmath127 instead of @xmath128 . with the usual prescription of 10% for the loss",

    "<S> searching for a signal depending on unknown parameters in a noisy background with matched filtering techniques always requires an analysis of the data with several templates in parallel in order to ensure a proper match between the filter and the real waveform . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of such an implementation is the design of the filter bank which must be small to limit the computational cost while keeping the detection efficiency as high as possible . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a geometrical method which allows one to cover the corresponding physical parameter space by a set of ellipses , each of them being associated to a given template . after the description of the main characteristics of the algorithm , </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied in the field of gravitational wave ( gw ) data analysis , for the search of damped sine signals . </S>",
    "<S> such waveforms are expected to be produced during the de - excitation phase of black holes  the so - called ringdown signals  and </S>",
    "<S> are also encountered in some numerically computed supernova signals . </S>",
    "<S> first , the number of templates @xmath0 computed by the method is similar to its analytical estimation , despite the overlaps between neighbor templates and the border effects . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath0 is small enough to test for the first time the performances of the set of templates for different choices of the minimal match @xmath1 , the parameter used to define the maximal allowed loss of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) due to the mismatch between real signals and templates . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this analysis is that the fraction of snr recovered is in average much higher than @xmath1 , which dramatically decreases the mean percentage of false dismissals . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it goes well below its estimated value of @xmath2 used as input of the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as this feature should be common to any tiling algorithm , it seems possible to reduce the constraint on the value of @xmath1  and indeed the number of templates and the computing power  without loosing as much events as expected in average . </S>",
    "<S> this should be of great interest for the inspiralling binaries case where the number of templates can reach some hundreds of thousands for the whole parameter space .    </S>",
