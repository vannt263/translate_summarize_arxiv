    "high resolution spectroscopy of qso absorption systems provides a precise probe of fundamental physics . in previous papers ( dzuba , flambaum & webb 1999a , b ; webb et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter w99 ) we introduced and applied a new and highly sensitive method for constraining space - time variations of the fine structure constant , @xmath4 . using 30 keck / hires absorption spectra containing mgii and feii , we reported a tentative detection of a variation in @xmath0 : @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is defined as @xmath6 @xmath7 is the present day value of @xmath0 and @xmath8 is the value at the absorption redshift , @xmath9 .",
    "the absorption redshifts ranged from @xmath100.61.6 .",
    "here we continue this work , presenting new measurements of @xmath3 in high redshift damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) over the range @xmath11 , and a re - analysis of the w99 data set .",
    "four papers present our new work on this subject .",
    "a brief summary of all results is given in webb et al .",
    "the present paper provides a detailed description of our methods and results . a companion paper ( murphy et al .",
    "2001b , hereafter m01b ) presents a thorough examination of systematic effects . an additional paper ( murphy et al .",
    "2001c ) presents an analysis of a sample of siiv qso absorbers .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : previousth ] describes theoretical motivations for a search for varying @xmath0 . in section [ sec : previousex ] we summarise previous experimental constraints on varying @xmath0 . section [ sec : theory ] presents the theoretical basis of the new method for determining @xmath3 using qso absorbers .",
    "section [ sec : req ] describes the experimental components of our study : high - resolution qso observations and precise laboratory rest wavelength measurements . in section [ sec : anal ] we discuss our analysis technique in detail and present our results . for completeness",
    "we also summarise the systematic effects discussed in detail in m01b .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] summarises our new results and outlines future work .",
    "the constancy of the fundamental constants began to be questioned when milne ( 1935 , 1937 ) and dirac ( 1937 ) suggested that the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath12 , may vary in cosmological time .",
    "milne proposed a gravitational theory in which different physical ` clocks '  ` ticking ' according to different physical processes  ` tick ' at different rates as time progresses .",
    "the possible consequences of this hypothesis for biological and geological history were seized upon by haldane ( 1937a , b ) to explain aspects of their discontinuous development , whereas kothari ( 1938 ) and chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) pointed out some astronomical consequences of dirac s large numbers hypothesis which might permit it to be tested by observation .",
    "dirac s large numbers hypothesis attracted considerable interest ( e.g. teller 1948 ; dicke 1957 , 1961 ; barrow 1990 ; barrow & tipler 1996 ) and the desire to place his idea of varying @xmath12 on a firmer theoretical footing led to the development of scalar - tensor generalisations of einstein s theory of general relativity in which the variation of @xmath12 was described self - consistently by the propagation of a scalar field which also acted as a source of space - time curvature ( brans & dicke 1961 ) .",
    "jordan ( 1937 , 1939 ) was the first to consider how dirac s hypothesis might be applied to forces other than gravity , but rejected the possibility of time variations in the weak interaction or the electron - proton mass ratio ( jordan 1937 , 1939 ) . later , gamow ( 1967 ) showed that geological problems caused by dirac s proposed variation in @xmath12 that had been pointed out by teller ( 1948 ) could be avoided by interpreting the large numbers hypothesis as requiring the time - variation of the charge on the electron , @xmath13 , rather than @xmath12 .",
    "observational limits on possible variations of @xmath0 or the weak and strong interactions were more restrictive than those on @xmath12 although no self - consistent theory permitting the variation of non - gravitational force constants was developed to make the observational limits rigorous .",
    "landau ( 1955 ) proposed that variation in @xmath0 could be connected to renormalization rules in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "current motivation for a search for a varying @xmath0 comes from modern theories which attempt to unify gravity with other interactions .      at present",
    "there are many theoretical motivations for a search for varying @xmath0 .",
    "however , these theories , being relatively recent , may not be widely appreciated within the context of astronomical tests of their viability .",
    "we therefore summarise recent ideas below .",
    "one of the greatest challenges facing modern theoretical physics is the quantization of the gravitational interaction .",
    "early attempts at creating such a unification were made using a geometrization in ( @xmath14)dimensional curved space - times in the spirit of the old kaluza - klein scenario to unite gravity and electromagnetism ( kaluza 1921 ; klein 1926 ) .",
    "three - dimensional gauge couplings like @xmath0 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 then must vary as the inverse square of the mean scale of the extra dimensions .",
    "thus , the evolution of the scale size of the extra dimensions is related to variability of the low - energy coupling constants in the 4dimensional subspace in simple kaluza - klein and superstring theories .",
    "damour & polyakov ( 1994 ) showed that cosmological variation in @xmath0 may proceed at different rates at different points in space - time ( see also forgcs & horvth 1979 ; barrow 1987 ; li & gott 1998 ) . various functional forms for time",
    "variation of @xmath17 have been derived using kaluza - klein theory and the assumption of constant masses .",
    "chodos & detweiler ( 1980 ) find @xmath18 and freund ( 1982 ) finds @xmath19 .",
    "wu & wang ( 1986 ) have found that @xmath20 where the proportionality constant is unknown .",
    "it is interesting to note that using a similar analysis to wu & wang , maeda ( 1988 ) derived @xmath21 .",
    "marciano ( 1984 ) discussed the self - consistency relations required if there are simultaneous variations of different constants in unified gauge theories .",
    "he also examined any possible non - monotonic variation in @xmath0 with @xmath22 , using the running coupling dependence of strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions to produce self - consistent predictions for the simultaneous variation of more than one coupling or mass ratio .",
    "these were discussed in drinkwater et al .",
    "typically , variation in @xmath12 and @xmath0 could be linked by relations of the form @xmath23 .",
    "these features of extra dimensions mean that in all string theories ( and m - theory , of which they are presumed to be limiting cases , hoava & witten 1996a , b ) , any extra dimensions of space need to be held static with high accuracy in order to avoid gross conflict with observation . in the currently popular scenarios for m - theory ( e.g. antoniadis et al .",
    "1998 ; arkani - hamed , dimopoulos & dvali 1998 ; randall & sundrum 1999a , b ) , only the gravitational force is assumed to act in all ( @xmath24 ) spatial dimensions ( the ` bulk ' ) whilst all other interactions act only in 3-dimensional space ( the ` brane ' ) .",
    "observations of the constancy of 3-dimensional non - gravitational constants governing the strengths of those interactions in three dimensions ( like @xmath0 ) could therefore be of crucial importance in testing this theoretical scenario .",
    "the scale of the extra dimensions was until recently believed to be necessarily of order the planck scale @xmath25 but it is possible they could be as large as @xmath26 leading to large changes in the form of the newtonian law of gravity on length scales below this distance . at present , this is consistent with all known experiments .",
    "the challenge of testing the law of gravity on sub - millimetre scales is considerable because other forces strongly dominate the effects of gravity on these scales .",
    "the first self consistent theory of electromagnetism which incorporates varying @xmath0 , and which reduces to maxwell s theory in the limit of constant @xmath0 , was that developed by bekenstein ( 1982 ) .",
    "it introduces a scalar field whose variation in space and time produces effective variation in the electron charge ( or , equivalently , the permittivity of free space ) .",
    "the form of the propagation equation for the evolution of the scalar field is strongly constrained by the natural requirements that it be second order , causal and linearly coupled to the matter density .",
    "this particular theory has been constrained by several astronomical observations ( livio & stiavelli 1998 ) and used to illustrate consequences of space and time variations of constants ( barrow & otoole 2000 ) .",
    "the general structure of bekenstein s theory can also be applied to other couplings , and it has recently been used to investigate the problem of varying the strong coupling constant of qcd by chamoun , landau & vucetich ( 2000 ) .",
    "bekenstein makes the simplifying assumption that the gravitational sector of the theory be unchanged from that of general relativity .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the contribution of the kinetic energy of the scalar field associated with @xmath0 variation to the expansion dynamics of the universe .",
    "this defect can be avoided in other versions of this theory ( barrow & magueijo 2000 ; magueijo 2000 ) .",
    "it should be emphasised that there is no single self - consistent theory incorporating varying @xmath0 and theoretical limits need to be quoted in conjunction with the theoretical framework used to confront observational data .",
    "if different interactions are unified by electro - weak or grand unified theories then the ramifications of introducing varying @xmath0 will be deeper and wider and a scalar theory would need to accommodate the effects of varying @xmath0 on the other gauge couplings .",
    "one appeal of varying speed of light theories is that they provide alternative potential solutions to a range of cosmological problems such as the flatness , horizon and monopole problems ( moffat 1993 ; barrow & magueijo 1999a , b ; albrecht & magueijo 1999 ; barrow 1999 ) . barrow & magueijo ( 1998 ) have also expressed bekenstein s ( 1982 ) varying-@xmath13 theory in terms of varying @xmath27 .    barrow & magueijo ( 2000 ) developed a particular theory for varying @xmath27 ( or @xmath0 ) in which the stress contributed by the cosmological constant varies through the combination @xmath28 .",
    "they also showed how the observed non - zero cosmological acceleration ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) might be linked to a varying @xmath0 .",
    "they examined a class of varying-@xmath27 theories in which changes in @xmath27 are driven by a scalar field which is coupled to the gravitational effect of pressure .",
    "changes in @xmath27 convert the @xmath29 energy density into radiation , preventing @xmath29 from dominating the universe in the radiation epoch .",
    "as pressureless matter begins to dominate , variations in @xmath27 slow , and @xmath29 begins to dominate .",
    "the very slow variation of the scalar field driving changes in @xmath27 is like that of scalar fields in quintessence theories in the presence of perfect fluids .",
    "this type of theory allows the time variations in @xmath27 or @xmath0 to be @xmath30 at @xmath31 and yet the associated @xmath32 term can be dominant today and produce acceleration ( the @xmath33 factor is created naturally in this theory by the ratio of the radiation to matter density in the universe today ) .",
    "we therefore expect only very small residual variation in @xmath0 in a @xmath29 dominated universe .",
    "the existence of simple theories of this sort provides a strong motivation for studies like the present one .",
    "several authors have suggested other motivations for varying @xmath0 .",
    "for example , hill & ross ( 1988a , b ) ( see also hill , steinhardt & turner 1990 ) have suggested that oscillatory variations in @xmath0 might be expected if there exists a soft boson field that has electromagnetic couplings to either the maxwell scalar , @xmath34 , or to the electron state , @xmath35 . if the boson field has a mass @xmath36 then the frequency of emission and absorption of radiation will vary with a frequency @xmath37 . an oscillatory @xmath0 might also be attributable to the decaying oscillations of a scalar field that couples to @xmath38",
    ". such a theory is allowed by enforcing an approximate global symmetry ( carroll 1998 ) .    in summary",
    ", there is much current theoretical motivation for experimental searches for variability in @xmath0 , particularly at medium to high redshifts .",
    "a detection of variation may allow us to probe the extra dimensions expected from many modern unified theories .",
    "a search for varying @xmath0 provides an important tool for seeking out and constraining the form of new physics .",
    "direct laboratory measurements provide interesting constraints on a time - varying @xmath0 .",
    "prestage , robert & maleki ( 1995 ) introduced a new technique comparing the rates of clocks based on ultra - stable oscillators .",
    "relativistic corrections are order @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the atomic number or nuclear charge . by comparing the rates of two clocks based on different atoms ( h - maser and hg@xmath41 ) over a 140 day period , they were able to constrain @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) .    model dependent upper limits on any variation have been claimed from an analysis of the oklo phenomenon  a natural nuclear fission reactor that operated in gabon , west africa , @xmath101.8 billion years ago .",
    "shlyakhter ( 1976 ) originally constrained the energy of the nuclear resonance level in the @xmath44sm isotope and related this to upper bounds on @xmath45 .",
    "damour & dyson ( 1996 ) have also analysed the problem with different model assumptions and claim @xmath46 . recently ,",
    "fujii et al . ( 2000 ) obtained somewhat tighter constraints using new samples from the oklo reactor : @xmath47 .",
    "however , the oklo limit corresponds to variations at very low ` redshift ' , @xmath48 , in a non - cosmological environment . in the absence of a detailed theory giving both time _ and _ space variations of @xmath0 ,",
    "it is dangerous to compare time variations in areas of different gravitational potential ( barrow & otoole 2000 ) .",
    "also , there are considerable uncertainties regarding the complicated oklo environment and any limits on @xmath0 derived from it can be weakened by allowing other interaction strengths and mass ratios to vary in time as well .      savedoff ( 1956 ) first analysed doublet separations seen in galaxy emission spectra to constrain possible time variation of @xmath0 . absorption lines in intervening clouds along the line of sight to qsos are substantially narrower than intrinsic emission lines and therefore provide a more precise probe of @xmath0 .",
    "this prompted bahcall , sargent & schmidt ( 1967 ) to use alkali - doublet spacings seen in the absorption spectra of qsos to arrive at firm upper limits on any variation .",
    "the appeal of this method is the huge time span probed by high - redshift observations .",
    "wolfe , brown & roberts ( 1976 ) first applied the alkali - doublet ( ad ) method to intervening mgii absorption .",
    "varshalovich , panchuk & ivanchik ( 1996 ) have used the ad method for many absorbers to obtain upper limits on any variation at redshifts @xmath49@xmath50 : @xmath51 .",
    "varshalovich , potekhin & ivanchik ( 2000 ) have recently analysed 16 siiv absorption systems ( towards 6 qsos ) using the ad method .",
    "they find a mean @xmath52 using the siiv laboratory wavelengths of morton ( 1991 ) .",
    "the systematic component to the error above ( @xmath53 ) allows for the relative uncertainties of the siiv laboratory wavelengths .",
    "however , griesmann & kling ( 2000 ) have increased the absolute precision of these wavelengths and their new values indicate that the varshalovich et al .",
    "( 2000 ) result should be corrected by @xmath54 to @xmath55 suggesting that the systematic error component added by varshalovich et al .",
    "was significantly underestimated .    in murphy et al .",
    "( 2001c ) we have used the new griesmann & kling laboratory wavelengths to constrain @xmath3 using 21 siiv doublets towards 8 qsos .",
    "the spectral resolution and snr are higher than for the varshalovich et al . sample .",
    "this , and the higher precision laboratory wavelengths , provide a more stringent constraint of @xmath56 .",
    "this result is nevertheless a factor of 7 less precise than the results we present in this paper , highlighting the strength of the methods we use .",
    "the optical techniques above were based on the ad method : constraining @xmath0 from the splitting of single ads such as siiv , civ and mgii .",
    "very recently , however , dzuba et al .",
    "( 1999a ) and w99 proposed a new method that allows _ an order of magnitude increase in precision_. the method is based on measuring the wavelength separation between the resonance transitions of _ different ionic species _ with no restriction on the multiplet to which the transitions belong .",
    "we outline this many - multiplet ( mm ) method and discuss its advantages in section [ sec : theory ] of this paper .",
    "radio spectra of qso absorption clouds also provide the opportunity for tightly constraining possible variations in the fundamental constants .",
    "wolfe et al . ( 1976 ) demonstrated that combining optical resonance and hi@xmath57 hyperfine absorption spectra could yield constraints on @xmath58 . here",
    ", @xmath59 is the proton g - factor and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mass of the electron and proton respectively ; see also the discussion by pagel ( 1983 ) .",
    "varshalovich & potekhin ( 1996 ) used a comparison of hi@xmath57 hyperfine and molecular rotational absorption to constrain variations in @xmath61 but drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that such a combination actually constrains @xmath62 . in murphy",
    "et al . ( 2001d ) we have also made a more complete analysis of the two drinkwater et al .",
    "radio spectra to obtain constraints on @xmath63 .",
    "assuming @xmath59 to be constant , we find @xmath64 and @xmath65 at @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively . if we note the  points in the lower panel ( binned data ) of fig .",
    "3 then we see that our results are also consistent with the two radio points .",
    "carilli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also recently analysed independent spectra of these two qsos and find an upper limit on any variation consistent with our measurements : @xmath68 ( again assuming @xmath59 to be constant ) .",
    "cowie & songaila ( 1995 ) have also obtained constraints at @xmath69 .",
    "they compare the observed frequencies of the hi@xmath70 and uv ci absorption lines which are sensitive to variations in @xmath71 . if one assumes that @xmath72 is constant then their constraint corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath0 in the past would change the ionization history of the universe , postponing the recombination of electrons and protons , i.e. last - scattering would occur at lower redshift .",
    "it would also alter the ratio of baryons to photons at last - scattering , leading to changes in both the amplitudes and positions of features in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum , primarily at angular scales @xmath74 ( hannestad 1999 ; kaplinghat , scherrer & turner 1999 ; avelino , martins & rocha 2000 ; battye , crittenden & weller 2000 ; kujat & scherrer 2000 ) .",
    "kolb , perry & walker ( 1986 ) have discussed how limits can be placed on @xmath3 at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( corresponding to a redshift @xmath75 ) by assuming a simple scaling between the value of @xmath0 and the neutron - proton mass difference . using observations of the @xmath76he abundance",
    "they derive limits of @xmath77 , corresponding to @xmath78 .",
    "barrow ( 1987 ) and campbell & olive ( 1995 ) considered the simultaneous variation of weak , strong and electromagnetic couplings on primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , these limits are beset by a crucial uncertainty as to the electromagnetic contributions to the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "much weaker limits are possible if attention is restricted to the nuclear interaction effects on the nucleosynthesis of deuterium , helium-3 , and lithium-7 .",
    "bergstrm , iguri & rubinstein ( 1999 ) have re - examined all light elements up to @xmath79li . by including elements heavier than @xmath76he they avoid the problem of the unknown electromagnetic contributions to the neutron - proton mass difference , and argue that a more realistic limit , given the present observational uncertainties in the light element abundances is more like @xmath80 .",
    "the mm method allows an order of magnitude greater precision compared to the previous ad method .",
    "the full details behind this technique are presented in detail in dzuba et al .",
    "( 1999a , b , 2001 ) and w99 and so we present only the salient features here .    to explain the mm method , we begin with a simple analytic approach to estimate the relativistic effects in transition frequencies .",
    "if we consider a many - electron atom / ion then the relativistic correction , @xmath81 , to the energy of the external electron can be written as @xmath82\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the nuclear charge , @xmath83 is the electron energy ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the ionization potential ) and @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the total and orbital electron angular momenta .",
    "the contribution to the relativistic correction from many - body effects is described by @xmath88 . for @xmath89 and @xmath90 orbitals , @xmath91 and",
    "is of similar magnitude for @xmath92 orbitals .",
    "equation [ eq : relcor ] therefore provides a general strategy for probing the relativistic corrections in resonance transitions .",
    "for example , consider comparison of the transition energies of two @xmath89@xmath90 transitions , one in a light ion , the other in a heavy ion ( i.e. low and high @xmath40 respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath93 term dominates so the relativistic corrections to the transition energies will differ greatly .",
    "thus , comparison of the spectra of light and heavy species is a sensitive probe of @xmath0 .    as a further example , consider an @xmath89@xmath90 and a @xmath92@xmath90 transition in a heavy species .",
    "the corrections will be large in each case but will be of opposite sign since the many - body corrections , @xmath88 , begin to dominate with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "this situation also allows tight constraints to be placed on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , comparing spectra of transitions from different multiplets and different atoms or ions , provides a sensitive method for probing variations in @xmath0 . in comparison",
    ", the fine splitting of an @xmath89@xmath90 doublet will be substantially smaller than the absolute shift in the @xmath89@xmath90 transition energy since the excited @xmath90 electron , with relatively small @xmath85 , will have much smaller relativistic corrections than the @xmath89 electron .",
    "therefore , the ad method is relatively insensitive to variations in @xmath0 .    [",
    "tab : atomdata ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^ , > , < , > , > \" , ]     from the analyses we present in this paper and in m01b , we conclude that if our results are due to some effect other than a real variation in @xmath0 , this will only be revealed by further independent observations and analyses using the mm method .",
    "optical spectra are very useful for probing the range of redshifts we have explored here . however , a statistical sample of radio spectra of hi@xmath57 and molecular absorption systems has the potential to increase our precision limit by another order of magnitude .",
    "this effort is hampered by the fact that very few such systems are known at present . a systematic observational search for these systems",
    "should clearly be made .",
    "also , as the arsenal of @xmath94@xmath95 class optical telescopes with high - resolution spectrographs grows , more observations should be devoted to obtaining carefully calibrated , high snr spectra of absorption systems at both high and .",
    "these will provide a crucial check on our results and will allow us to discover or rule out any further subtle or unknown systematic effects in the data .",
