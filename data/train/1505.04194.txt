    "during the last decade there has been considerable progress in experimental studies of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac gas in various fields .",
    "this was initiated by the investigation of exfoliated and epitaxial graphene  [ ] , followed later by experiments with silicene  [ ] and with a number of chemical compounds , commonly referred to as topological insulators  [ ] .",
    "other realizations are optical hexagonal lattices filled with ultracold atoms  [ ] and photonic crystals  [ ] . besides the linear dirac spectrum with nodes",
    ", particle  particle interactions can play an important role , depending on the specific system .",
    "for instance , the coupling to lattice vibrations ( phonons in condensed matter realization  [ ] , shaking in optical lattices  [ ] and photonic crystals with dirac spectrum  [ ] ) can lead to instabilities  [ ] .",
    "such an instability was recently observed in graphene  [ ] .",
    "the complexity of the phonon modes can give rise to the plethora of other interesting effects .",
    "this is related to the fact that in  plane optical phonons act like effective gauge fields that couple to the dirac particles .",
    "moreover , it has been known for a long time that the coupling of massive dirac particles to gauge fields leads to chern ",
    "simons excitations  [ ] .",
    "it is crucial to note that the chern ",
    "simons term is created by the expansion of the fermion determinant with respect to a vector field , where the latter is usually a gauge field .",
    "we will show in this paper that an optical in  plane phonon mode , which is a massive vector field , can also create such a term . in condensed matter systems",
    "there is no ambiguity from the uv regularization because of a natural momentum cut - off from the underlying lattice .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study how the chern ",
    "simons term affects the transport properties .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the quantum hall effect and study the hall conductivity when the dirac fermions are gapped .",
    "our microscopic lattice model describes the interaction between spinless fermions and monochromatic transversal optical phonons on a two  dimensional hexagonal lattice .",
    "the dynamics of the free fermionic quasiparticles is given by the tight  binding hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote fermionic species identified with each sublattice of the hexagonal lattice and @xmath3ev is the hopping amplitude .",
    "we use the unit system with lattice constant , elementary electric charge , and @xmath4 .",
    "the index @xmath5 suggests the summation over next neighbors , while the absence of the parenthesis means summation over each sublattice index separately .",
    "the hamiltonian is readily diagonalized by the fourier  transform and yields a well  known spectrum with two degenerated parity symmetric fermi points . as a striking feature ,",
    "close to those fermi points the fermion dispersion is linear and therefore describes massless dirac particles . in order to model the fermion mass we have to account either for a staggered potential altering its sign from one lattice site to another  [ ] , or for a spin  orbit coupling term  [ ] .",
    "the parity between the cones is broken by exposing the system to the chemical modification , e.g. by a periodic flux  [ ] or a spin texture  [ ] . combining fermionic operators to spinors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the mass term reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude between second nearest neighbors ( @xmath10  [ ] ) and the matrix element of the haldane term is given by  [ ] @xmath11 with the adjustable peierls phase @xmath12 , and @xmath13 denoting the positions of the second nearest neighbors on the hexagonal lattice . a particular choice of both parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 opens up a gap at one dirac point with size @xmath16 , while keeping the other dirac point gapless .",
    "this band structure is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "moreover , changing the value of the peierls phase , it is also possible to get into the situation where all cones are gapped with different signs of the dirac mass . for the chosen parameter set ,",
    "all elements of the conductivity tensor of the haldane model are nonzero  [ ] , where the gapped ( gapless ) channel contributes to the hall ( longitudinal ) conductivity .",
    "but since we are primarily interested in the anomalous hall conductivity , we focus on the gapped channel only .",
    "recently , an experimental realization of the haldane model was reported in ref .  [ ] .    in our model",
    "the monochromatic phonons appear as fluctuating bonds between neighboring sites  [ ] . the corresponding holstein hamiltonian reads @xmath17 the operator @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) destroys ( creates ) a phonon between sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the continuous limit the phonons couple to the spinors via combinations of non  diagonal pauli matrices @xmath22 with the coupling strength @xmath23 . while the phonon frequency @xmath24mev is intrinsic to the hexagonal lattice  [ ] , the electron  phonon coupling strength @xmath23 , measured in units @xmath25 , can be varied in the experiment .    in the continuous limit we use the low ",

    "it is important to stress that , in contrast to gauge fields , our @xmath41 are massive fluctuations of the lattice , which can not be constrained by gauge fixing .",

    "finally , the slow lattice dynamics ( @xmath45 ) is neglected in comparison to the much faster electron dynamics .",
    "integrating out the phonon fields @xmath41 yields an interaction term for the fermions @xmath46 .",
    "this resembles the standard thirring current ",
    "current interaction  [ ] with one crucial difference , though , that we have only two spatial currents here . due to the anticommutativity of the grassmann field , this interaction can be rewritten as the usual repulsive hubbard interaction @xmath47 . throughout the subsequent calculations we implement a large but finite uv ",

    "since the dirac hamiltonian is unbounded , some terms in the perturbative expansion are plagued by ultraviolet divergences .",
