    "the existence of space - like singularities is a generic feature of einstein s general theory of relativity and this is proved by the singularity theorems of penrose , hawking and geroch@xcite .",
    "the singularities are usually characterized by divergences of curvature invariants or breakdown of geodesics .",
    "this indicates a limit beyond which general theory relativity is not applicable anymore .",
    "it is widely believed that a theory of quantum gravity will be the one which can provide insights on the resolution of singularities .",
    "in fact there are different approaches for quantum theory of gravity , so the description at low energy limit also have competing candidates even at the phenomenological level .    various approaches for quantum gravity such as string theory and black hole physics , have predicted the existence of a minimum measurable length and an essential modification of the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite to the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) . the gup is based on the modification of the fundamental commutation relation mainly in position and momenta .",
    "recent developments suggests that the minimal length scale can be implemented in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory through the gup . within the framework of the gup minimal length scale",
    "has been studied in details in quantum mechanics , quantum electrodynamics , thermodynamics , black - hole physics and cosmology .",
    "for some recent reviews on the phenomenology of different minimal length scale scenarios inspired by various approaches to the quantum gravity see @xcite .",
    "quite recently ali et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a new approach which predicts maximum observable momenta besides a minimal measurable length .",
    "this model is built to be consistent with dsr@xcite , string theory and black hole physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it ensures that @xmath2=0=[p_i , p_j]$ ] through jacobi identity@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the modification of the heisenberg uncertainty relation near the planck scale reads    & = & i  .",

    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are speed of light in vacuum , planck mass and planck length respectively . @xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter usually considered to be of order unity .",
    "the upper bounds on the parameter @xmath8 have been estimated in @xcite and it was suggested that it could predict an intermediate length scale between planck scale and electroweak scale . a recent proposal suggested that these bounds can be measured using quantum optics techniques in @xcite which may be considered as a milestone in quantum gravity phenomenology . due to the gup as proposed in @xcite the physical momentum is redefined . as a result",
    "the classical hamiltonian as well as the quantum hamiltonian gets modified which affects the quantum phenomena .",
    "recently , bekenstein @xcite proposed that quantum gravitational effects could be tested experimentally , he suggests `` a tabletop experiment which , given state of the art ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic technology , could already be sensitive enough to detect planck scale signals '' @xcite . in a series of papers , the effects of gup on atomic systems , condensed matter systems , preheating phase of the universe , inflationary era of the universe and black holes",
    "have been investigated @xcite .    in this paragraph",
    "we shed some light on the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics as in the later sections we are going to use gup modified classical poisson brackets .",
    "the known correspondence between commutator and poisson bracket was first proposed by dirac where he proposed that the quantum counterparts @xmath9 , @xmath10 of classical observables @xmath11 , @xmath12 satisfy @xcite = i \\{a , b } and since that time , this is known as a postulate of quantum mechanics . in 1946",
    ", hip groenewold demonstrated that a general systematic correspondence between quantum commutators and poisson brackets could not hold consistently @xcite .",
    "however , he did appreciate that such a systematic correspondence does , in fact , exist between the quantum commutator and a deformation of the poisson bracket , which is called the moyal bracket @xcite .",
    "the moyal bracket is a way of describing the commutator of observables in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics when these observables are described as functions on phase space .",
    "it relies on schemes for identifying functions on phase space with quantum observables , the most famous of these schemes being weyl quantization @xcite .",
    "it underlies moyal s dynamical equation , an equivalent formulation of heisenberg s quantum equation of motion , thereby providing the quantum generalization of hamilton s equations . in a two - dimensional flat phase space , and for the weyl - map correspondence ,",
    "the moyal bracket reads , \\{\\{f , g } } = ( fg- gf)= \\{f , g}+(^2 ) . where @xmath13 is the star - product operator in phase space ( moyal product ) , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are differentiable phase - space functions , and @xmath16 is their poisson bracket .",
    "this means moyel bracket is equal to poisson bracket in its equivalence with the quantum commutator up to the second order of @xmath17 ( i.e @xmath18 ) . in this present paper",
    "we study the implications of gup which has a linear term in @xmath3 as well as a quadratic one . for the friedmann model",
    "we only consider the correction which is proportional to @xmath3 in the commutator of eqn.([comm01 ] ) and @xmath19 where @xmath20 , which means moyel bracket is not necessary in our model and poisson bracket is quite enough to study the commutator of gup . for studying bianchi models we consider the most general form of gup ( including linear as well as quadratic term in @xmath3 ) and also gup with only linear term in @xmath3 in which we trust using poisson bracket , and we make a comparative analysis with earlier results in the literature @xcite .    motivated by the gup , many authors studied some classical problems with deformed poisson brackets @xcite",
    ". from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", constraints were placed on deformation parameters in @xcite by considering the effects of gup motivated deformed poisson algebra on the classical orbits of particles in the central force problem . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that modified commutation relations as suggested by candidate theories of quantum gravity , persist in the classical limit also . there",
    "the perihelion precession rate for keplerian orbits was calculated . a deformed heisenberg algebra or in the classical case , a deformed poisson algebra incorporate some additional problems like the violation of equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "but recently in @xcite it was shown that the gup is reconciled with the equivalence principle .",
    "the effects of the gup on galilean and lorentz transformation is also studied recently in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to study the implication of the gup as proposed in @xcite in early universe cosmology .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 in ( [ comm01 ] ) is relevant in the very early universe or near planck scale and it dies down at low energy scales and hence can be neglected at a later time in the evolution of the universe .",
    "however there are attempts to address the problem of dark energy in the realm of gup . in @xcite",
    "the classical and quantum effects of this gup are investigated on the phase space of a dilatonic cosmological model and it was found that it is possible to get a late time acceleration for this model .",
    "a similar study was done in @xcite and it was shown that gup at first generates acceleration but prevents the eternal acceleration at late times and turns it into deceleration .",
    "the gup can also incorporate corrections in the entropy area relation and thereby modify the energy densities in holographic and agegraphic dark energy models . due to this",
    "we can get distinct terms in the form of @xmath21 which may have its importance in explaining the early inflationary scenario as well as the present accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present work is to investigate the effect of the gup on the dynamics of the friedmann - robertson - walker universe ( frw ) by performing this modification at the classical level by studying the modifications induced on the symplectic geometry by the deformed algebra .",
    "it is found that big bang singularity seems to be suppressed , by considering gup .",
    "it is found that modified friedmann equation predicts a cosmological bounce .",
    "besides , we extend our study to investigate the effect of gup on bianchi i and ii universes . in each case the deformed commutation relations due to gup would modify the dynamical equations and hence we will find departures from the usual scenario .",
    "we investigate the isotropy of bianchi universes as well as the singularity .",
    "later we will see that the results remain qualitatively same compared to the gup which has a quadratic term in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however a discussion on the sign of @xmath3 is made later which is important for the analysis .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : frw ] , we investigate the gup with frw universe and derive the modified freidmann equation . in sec .",
    "[ bianchi ] , we tackle the impact of gup on bianchi universes with type i and ii . we compare our results with previous studies in @xcite .",
    "here we study the gup deformed dynamics of an isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model .",
    "let us start with a review of the standard case .",
    "the frw metric can be described by the line element as ds^2=- n^2 dt^2+a(t)^2 ( + r^2 d^2 ) [ metric ] where @xmath22 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath23 is the lapse function .",
    "the constant @xmath24 is a measure of spatial flatness and it can be @xmath25 .",
    "the dynamics of such models are summarized in the hamiltonian constraint = - - a k + a^3 = 0 [ constraint ] where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant and @xmath27 represents the matter density in the universe .",
    "the freidmann equation can be derived using poisson brackets \\{a , b}=(- ) \\{x_i , p_j}[poisson ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the canonical variables of the system . in the standard case ,",
    "the canonical variables are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 and these canonical variables satisfy the poisson bracket as @xmath32 .",
    "this is due to the fact that isotropy reduces the phase space of the model to two dimensional .",
    "the friedmann equations can be extracted by the hamilton s equations which can be derived from the extended hamiltonian _",
    "e= + n a k - n a^3 + where @xmath33 is the lagrange multiplier , and @xmath34 is the momentum conjugate to the lapse @xmath23 which vanishes .",
    "this would give the equation of motion for the lapse @xmath35 and the scalar constraint of eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) is obtained by the fact that the constraint @xmath36 will be satisfied at all times which is equivalent to demand that the secondary constraint @xmath37 holds .",
    "the other equations of motion regarding @xmath30 and @xmath31 with respect to extended hamiltonian are & = & \\{a , h_e}== n [ dota ] + & = & \\{p_a , h_e}=n ( - k+ 3 a^2 + a^3 ) [ dotp ] by using the equations ( [ dota ] ) and ( [ dotp ] ) and the scalar constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , we can obtain the equation of motion for @xmath38 which represents the freidmann equation ( ) ^2= - usually @xmath39 is called the hubble rate . it is well known that this classical equation breaks down at the big - bang singularity and a natural crisis for a quantum description of the universe in planck scale occurs .",
    "now we use the gup as proposed in @xcite for a heuristic analysis of the singularity at big - bang . here",
    "we intend to study the classical equations only . as discussed earlier in details , here we will consider only the gup motivated deformed poisson algebra to study the classical equations that govern our universe . with implementing the gup up to the first order of @xmath3 , we get the poisson bracket between @xmath30 and @xmath31 as \\{a , p_a}= 1 - 2 p_a  . here",
    "we have replaced the quantum mechanical commutator by the poisson bracket .",
    "so , using the poisson algebra of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) , we get the modified equations of motions for frw universe as = \\{a,_e}= ( 1 - 2 p_a ) + = \\{p_a,_e}= - ( 1 - 2 p_a ) using the expression for the extended hamiltonian we follow the same procedure as in the standard case and get the modified equations of motions as & = & n ( 1 - 2 p_a ) [ mdota ] + & = & \\{p_a , h_e}=n ( - k+ 3 a^2 + a^3 ) ( 1 - 2p_a)[mdotp ] using equations ( [ mdota ] ) and ( [ mdotp ] ) with the scalar constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , we obtain the equation of motion for the hubble rate @xmath39 which represents the modified / deformed friedmann equation due to gup as ( ) ^2= ( - ) by considering the spatially flat case in which k=0 , we find that the modified friedmann equation will be [ fr3 ] ( ) ^2=    this equation appears to represent a big bounce picture for the frw universe with some critical density .",
    "this equation appears to introduce an interesting result , since it links the matter density @xmath27 with the expansion rate @xmath30 .",
    "it implies that the value of matter density @xmath40 is always bounded with @xmath41 so the correction due to gup is always kept @xmath42 , or otherwise we will get an imaginary density or expansion rate .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to the effect of gup on black hole thermodynamics , in which the final stages of a black hole reach to a remnant due to gup effect , and this remnant does not radiate any more , otherwise , we will get imaginary hawking temperature @xcite .",
    "this lead us to define a critical density in the considered model as follows : _",
    "c^1/2= [ critden ] the inbuilt minimal length in the theory restricts the limit @xmath43 which keeps the _ _ dynamical _ _ on the scale factor @xmath30 .",
    "] value of @xmath44 finite .",
    "our modified friedmann equation ( [ fr3 ] ) has a very close resemblance with results found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the modified friedmann equations were studied with the form of the generalized uncertainty principle deduced from the snyder non - commutative space .",
    "the resulting poisson bracket used in the paper was @xmath45 which is consistent with the one described in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the resulting cosmological model predicts a cosmological bounce at some critical energy density .",
    "although our result is qualitatively similar to @xcite but the critical energy density in our case depends on the scale factor as seen in eqn.([critden ] ) . also due to the choice of the gup which contains a linear term in the planck length and momentum @xcite we get the modified friedmann equation where the minimal length manifests itself in the @xmath46 term .",
    "but in @xcite the same dependence comes from the @xmath47 term because the deformed poisson bracket had the minimal length with the quadratic term in momentum .",
    "it is very important to discuss the sign and value of @xmath3 in the gup of eqn.([comm01 ] ) .",
    "the gup is motivated by doubly special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite where a non - linear realization of lorentz transformations in energy - momentum space is parametrized by an invariant length scale @xmath48 .",
    "if _ a priori _ we do not consider @xmath8 to be a order one parameter , at least for phenomenological purposes , then its existence may signal a new length scale which can not exceed the electro - weak length scale @xmath49 as otherwise its effects would have been observed @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 in the present analysis depicts a close resemblance of the modified friedmann equation with the effective equation of lqc @xcite . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the string inspired randall - sundrum braneworld scenario leads to a similar modification of the friedmann equation @xcite . in this case",
    "we can not get a bouncing scenario as @xmath38 does not vanish at @xmath53 . however if the extra dimension of the bulk spacetime is considered time - like",
    "then we get a similar prediction @xcite .    near the planck scale or at energy scales much greater than the electro - weak scale",
    "the term with @xmath3 would be highly relevant and the vanishing of the hubble rate may result in a cosmological bounce . at very low",
    "energy scales the term with @xmath3 will be irrelevant and hence can be neglected giving back our standard friedmann equation which is well suited to describe the later stages of the universe .",
    "a similar result was also found earlier in @xcite but interpreted in terms of the area of the apparent horizon .",
    "if we consider only the leading order correction due to gup then it can be shown that @xmath38 may vanish at some critical area of the apparent horizon .",
    "we now study the modified equations of motion for the bianchi universe by implementing the minimal length in quantum gravity which assume a natural cut - off on the anisotropies .",
    "the bianchi universes are spatially homogeneous cosmological spacetimes and the symmetry group acts on each spatial manifold @xcite . in the misner formalism",

    "the classical singularity occurs in the limit @xmath59 and the the potential term @xmath60 makes the classification between the models which is associated with the scalar curvature .",
    "now it is necessary to make a choice of the time parameter for analyzing the dynamics of the system .",
    "since the volume of the universe is proportional to @xmath61 so here we consider @xmath57 to be the time parameter and obtain an effective hamiltonian by solving the constraint equation ( [ h1 ] ) with respect to @xmath62 .",

    "later we will see that the effects of the two corrections are different . in each step",

    "<S> the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe and bianchi i , ii universes are investigated in the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) with a linear and a quadratic term in planck length and momentum , which predicts minimum measurable length as well as maximum measurable momentum . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the wall velocity appears to be stationary with respect to the universe velocity which means that when the momentum of the universe evolves into a maximum measurable energy , the bounce is enhanced against the wall which means no maximum limit angle is manifested anymore .    * * ahmed farag ali@xmath0[multiblock footnote omitted ] and barun majumder @xmath1 +   +   +   + </S>"
