    "accurate lattice simulations of the standard model require three light flavours of dynamical quarks .",
    "the improved staggered - quark formalism is the only one capable of delivering large numbers of configurations with small quark masses anytime in the near future .",
    "this formalism , however has many non - degenerate pions whose masses do _ not _ vanish for zero quark mass .",
    "the residual masses come from mixing between the staggered copies of the quarks , and vanish like @xmath0 .",
    "nave staggered quarks suffer from poorly convergent perturbative expressions and large pion splittings which can be suppressed by the use of fat links  @xcite .",
    "staggered quarks which are improved to @xmath1  @xcite significantly reduce splittings in the pion spectrum  @xcite and have small renormalisations  @xcite . a related scheme with small pion splittings",
    "is the hyp action  @xcite .    to further reduce these undesirable splittings there are three alternatives : ( i ) to reduce @xmath2 at considerable cost ; ( ii ) to correct for them using modified chiral perturbation theory  @xcite or ( iii ) to further improve the quark action . in this work",
    "we show how to quantify and reduce the effects of these interactions by further improvement .",
    "firstly we look at taste - changing in nave quarks where one has physical intuition and the calculation is easier , then we convert to staggered quarks and present our results and conclusions .",
    "nave quarks have an exact symmetry : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 ,  giving 16 degenerate copies of every quark , one in each corner of the brillouin zone .",
    "these doublers can mix by exchanging a very hard gluon as shown in figure  [ f : treetastechange ] .",
    "this gluon is highly virtual with momentum @xmath6 and thus the quark - quark interaction is effectively a purely perturbative contact interaction at typical lattice spacings .",
    "boston_writeup_feyn    ( 60,60 )    the tree - level interaction of figure  [ f : treetastechange ] was understood and completely removed with the improved staggered action by using smearing to suppress high - momentum gluon emission from quarks  @xcite . to further reduce the splitting we turn to one - loop taste - changing diagrams of which there are five for massless quarks .",
    "each quark line has an odd number of gamma - matrices and therefore the spinor structure must be a combination of @xmath7 ; while the colour structure is singlet or octet . in principle",
    "there is a different coefficient for every current contact interaction between all combinations of the four corners of the brillouin zone , 16@xmath8 in total , although momentum conservation eliminates some .",
    "the doubling transformation can be applied separately to each quark line , however , and along with rotational invariance leaves only four independent interactions labelled by @xmath9 in each of the two spinor and two colour channels .",
    "the calculations are easiest using ( improved ) nave quarks , and nave quark operators are easily converted to the familiar _ _ spinor__@xmath10_taste _ staggered operators . ignoring gluons we have charge eigenstate currents : @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are 4-vectors of 0 s and 1 s ( like @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 a phase factor for hermiticity .",
    "the @xmath18 current corresponds to nave momentum transfer @xmath19 .",
    "armed with our map we can translate all the nave interactions to get the most general counter - terms : @xmath20 ^ 2 \\notag\\\\ & + \\alpha_s^2 \\sum_{s , t , a}\\frac12(\\text{coeff})^2 \\bigl[{{\\overline{\\psi}}}\\,\\gamma_s\\otimes\\xi_t\\,t^a\\,\\psi\\bigr]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all one- and three - link currents which are hermitian taste non - singlets with colour singlets and octets .",
    "adding these terms to the tree - level action will cancel the one - loop taste - changing and suppress the pion splittings by about one power of @xmath21 .",
    "the coefficients for improved staggered quarks with improved glue are shown in table [ t : asqtad ] ; all are around 1 , decreasing with @xmath9 , but the final column is zero at this order .",
    "this calculation gives us a tool to perturbatively investigate the taste - changing in tree - level actions .",
    "we investigated several significant modifications to the improved staggered quark action to try and reduce those coefficients and thereby avoid some or all of the four - quark operators .",
    "we tried partial re - unitarisation , adding an irrelevant term , and smearing the lepage term from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the best modification was this broadened lepage term [ blt ] which reduces to negligible the more expensive `` 3-link '' contact terms as shown in the lower half of table  [ t : blt ] . some early simulation results for pions splittings with this action are already available  @xcite .",
