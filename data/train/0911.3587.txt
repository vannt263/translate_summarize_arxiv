    "the astronomical observatory of the autonomous region of the aosta valley ( oavda ; 45.7895n , 7.47833e ) has been identified as a potential site for hosting a photometric transit search for low - mass , small - size planets around nearby cool m dwarf stars .",
    "we carried out a study to gauge the near - term and long - term photometric precision achievable , observing known transiting systems in a range of transit depths under variable seeing and sky transparency conditions .",
    "we used a 25 cm maksutov f/3.8 reflector telescope equipped with a ccd moravian g2 - 3200me and an r filter centered at 610 nm ( field of view : 52.10 x 35.11 arcmin@xmath1 ; plate scale : 1.43 arcsec / pix ; qe@xmath287% at 610 nm ) .",
    "the seeing was monitored each night using a hartmann mask and the dimm technique .",
    "it varied in the range 1 - 3 arcsec ( median @xmath21.7 arcsec ) .",
    "data reduction and ensemble differential aperture photometry ( @xmath2100 reference objects ) were carried out with the version 1.0 of an automated , idl - based pipeline we have developed .",
    "in may - august 2009 we monitored three transiting systems : wasp-3 @xcite , hat - p-7 @xcite and gliese 436 @xcite .",
    "wasp-3 , a 1.24 msun star ( v=10.64 ) hosting a 1.76 mjupiter planet ( period=1.846834 days ) , was monitored for 19 nights , often reaching a photometric rms below 0.003 mag for stars with v@xmath013 .",
    "fig.1 shows one of the observed wasp-3b transits and the best - fit model is based on the formalism of , assuming quadratic limb darkening .",
    "we got : b=0.665@xmath30.003 ( impact parameter ) , i=81.24@xmath30.06 degrees ( orbital inclination ) , r=0.1091@xmath30.0006 ( planet - to - star radius ratio ) , tc=55041.411@xmath30.029 hjd ( time of mid transit ) .",
    "the median rms for the whole observing period is 0.006 mag ( v@xmath013 ) .",
    "the feasibility study demonstrated that the oavda is a promising site for a long - term photometric survey aimed to detect transiting low - mass , small - size planets .",
    "we are planning to set up a system of five 40 cm identical telescopes for an high - precision observing campaign focused on several hundreds nearby m dwarfs , improving the longitudinal coverage of similar programs already ongoing , such as the arizona - based mearth project .",
