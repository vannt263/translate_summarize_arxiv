    "zonoids form an important family of convex bodies ( i.e. , convex compact sets ) in the euclidean space @xmath2 , see @xcite . _",
    "zonoids _ are obtained as limits of zonotopes in the hausdorff metric , while zonotopes are minkowski ( elementwise ) sums of a finite number of segments .",

    "for instance , if @xmath0 is discrete in @xmath15 with only two possible values , then @xmath13 is a parallelogram ; if @xmath0 is isotropic , then @xmath13 is a ball .",
    "a slightly different construction of zonoids associated with random vectors was suggested by koshevoy and mosler , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "namely , the zonoid @xmath16 of @xmath0 is the expectation of @xmath17 $ ] and so the support function of @xmath16 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in order to stress the difference between the two variants of zonoids , we call @xmath13 the _ centred zonoid _ of @xmath0 , see section [ secnon - centred - zonoids ] for the comparison of the two concepts .",
    "note that @xmath16 is also well defined for some non - integrable @xmath0 .",
    "nonetheless from now on we always assume that all mentioned random variables and random vectors are integrable and not identically zero .",
    "it is well known that the zonoid of @xmath0 does not uniquely characterise its distribution .",
    "for instance , on the line , @xmath16 is the segment with end - points determined by the expectations of the positive and negative parts of @xmath0 , while @xmath13 is the segment with end - points @xmath20 .",
    "thus , all random variables with the same first absolute moment are not distinguishable in terms of their centred zonoids .",
    "the concept of zonoid is useful in multivariate statistics to define trimming and data depth , see @xcite . in case of ( non - centred ) zonoids , the expectations @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath3 uniquely determine the distribution of @xmath0 , and determine the support function of a convex body in @xmath23 called the _ lift zonoid _ of @xmath0 , see @xcite . in finance",

    "the well - known result of breeden and litzenberger @xcite saying that the prices of all call options determine the distribution of @xmath0 now becomes a corollary of a general uniqueness result for lift zonoids , see @xcite , theorem 2.21 , and @xcite .",

    "two families of integrable random variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 are called _ zonoid equivalent _ if all their finite - dimensional distributions are zonoid equivalent .",
    "the concept of zonoid equivalence is closely related to spectral representations of symmetric stable ( @xmath30 ) and max - stable processes . for instance , each @xmath30 process with @xmath31 admits the spectral representation @xmath32 where the equality is understood in the sense of all finite - dimensional distributions , @xmath33 is a family of functions from @xmath34 for a measurable space @xmath35 and @xmath36 is an @xmath30 random measure with control measure @xmath37 , see @xcite . if @xmath38 admits another spectral representation on a measurable space @xmath39 with functions @xmath40 , then the collections of functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 satisfy @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is easily seen by computing the characteristic function of the spectral representations , see @xcite , section 3.2 .",
    "if @xmath46 and both @xmath37 and @xmath47 are probability measures , then ( [ eqspec - chf ] ) can be interpreted as the zonoid equivalence of stochastic processes @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",

    "this close relationship between stable processes and zonoid equivalence makes it possible to figure out a number of properties of stochastic processes in relation to their zonoid equivalence .",
    "the paper starts with the analysis of the main implication of the zonoid equivalence .",
    "namely , in section [ seczono - equiv - homog ] we show that the zonoid equivalence yields the equality of the expected values for all even one - homogeneous function of the random vectors .",
    "whose finite - dimensional distributions remain zonoid equivalent for time shifts are discussed in section [ secisometries ] .",
    "this zonoid stationarity property is brought in relationship to the stationarity of related stable and max - stable processes through their lepage representations .    a result of hardin ( @xcite , theorem 1.1 )",
    "implies that the distribution of an integrable random vector @xmath0 is uniquely determined by @xmath48 for all @xmath3 , equivalently by the centred zonoid of @xmath49 . in theorem [ corpm ] , we show that , if @xmath0 is symmetric , it is possible to replace @xmath50 by any random variable taking values @xmath51 .",
    "section [ secsequences ] introduces the swap - invariance property for a random sequence that amounts to the zonoid equivalence of each permutation of all its finite subsequences , which is weaker than the exchangeability property .",
    "we prove the ergodic theorem for swap - invariant sequences and characterise the limits , thereby generalising the classical results for exchangeable sequences .",
    "zonoid equivalence of positive random vectors with respect to permutation of two their components has been investigated in @xcite and for all possible permutations in @xcite in view of financial applications .",
    "section [ secnon - centred - zonoids ] discusses relationships between centred and non - centred zonoids and also another symmetry property being stronger than the exchangeability . in this relation , consider @xmath52 as function @xmath53 of @xmath54 real arguments .",
    "the swap invariance means exactly that @xmath55 is invariant for permutations of @xmath56 with @xmath57 ; the exchangeability corresponds to the permutation invariance of @xmath56 for any ( and then all ) @xmath58 . assuming the full permutation invariance for all @xmath59 imposes a property ( called _ lift swap - invariance _ ) , which is stronger than the exchangeability of @xmath60 .",
    "a variant of this property for non - centred zonoids has been considered in @xcite and @xcite motivated by applications in finance .",
    "finally , section [ secequality - zonoids ] collects a number of relevant results concerning zonoids of particular distributions .",
    "it is shown that zonoids identify uniquely distributions from location - scale families under rather mild conditions .",
    "the special case of random vectors with positive coordinates is also analysed , in particular log - infinitely divisible laws being important in financial applications .",
    "the consideration of ( non - centred ) zonoids makes it possible to study possibly non - integrable random vectors , which is left for a future work .",
    "the same relates to @xmath61-zonoids considered in  @xcite .",
