    "scale - free networks have been in the forefront of networks research for almost two decades .",
    "examples range from social networks @xcite , biological networks @xcite to artificial networks like the internet @xcite and the world - wide web @xcite .",
    "the widely accepted mechanism for the evolution of growing scale - free networks is preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been extensively explored and many generalizations and modifications of the original model have been suggested @xcite . the same principle has also been applied to equilibrium networks @xcite .",
    "the preferential attachment mechanism has relations with random multiplicative processes ( @xcite ) which have relevance in many fields of statistical physics , and are known to produce skewed distributions . besides preferential attachment , some other methods of producing scale - free networks have been exploited , for example , fitness - based models @xcite , merging processes @xcite , optimization models @xcite , urn - based statistical ensembles @xcite , networks embedded into metric spaces @xcite , and others .",
    "most well - studied real networks appear to have degree distribution exponents larger than two . as a result , and also due to the popularity of the preferential attachment mechanism , networks with smaller exponents have received much less attention . in such networks",
    "the mean degree diverges , and consequently the `` natural '' cutoff of the degree distribution scales with the system size in a different way compared to networks with higher exponents @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath1 is even more peculiar : the normalization condition implies that the cutoff of the degree distribution must remain finite in an infinite system .",
    "this circumstance makes it rather difficult to clearly identify such distributions in empirical data obtained from sparse networks . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mean vertex degree is sufficiently large , this kind of distribution can be observed ( see below ) , which justifies our investigation . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only studied model for networks with @xmath1 , was that of trees growing based on `` the power of choice '' ( local optimization of the new connections ) @xcite .",
    "note that variations of the models with hidden variables @xcite can also generate such degree distributions if one chooses an appropriate distribution of hidden variables .    in the present paper we consider two simple equilibrium network models producing @xmath1 .",
    "these rewiring models are local in the sense that the vertices need to `` know '' only the structure of their immediate neighbourhoods .",
    "we show that the resulting degree distribution has a simple exact solution in the sparse network limit , where the network is uncorrelated , which is a power - law of @xmath1 with an exponential cutoff that is determined by the mean degree .",
    "we perform extensive numerical simulations of these models for finite networks , and observe marked disassortative degree  degree correlations .     and @xmath0 . ]",
    "a well - studied class of mechanisms that is known to produce power - law distributions , is random multiplicative processes @xcite .",
    "the essence of such models is that the fluctuations of random variables are proportional to their values ( independent fluctuations would result in classical brownian dynamics ) .",
    "a simple example of such processes is discussed in @xcite and is shown to generate power - law distributions of exponent 1 .",
    "we use a similar principle . in our case , the random variables are the degrees of nodes in the network . instead of fluctuations which are proportional to the values of the random variables , we apply fluctuations of a fixed size ( rewiring one link at a time ) with a probability that is proportional to the values of the random variables ( degrees of nodes ) . here",
    "we consider a model of equilibrium networks that realizes this scheme .",

    "if there are no such nodes , then nothing should be done in this iteration .",
    "we denote the degree distribution by @xmath7 . the joint degree distribution , i.e. , the probability that the end nodes of a uniformly randomly chosen link have degrees @xmath8 and @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 , and the conditional probability that an end node of a random link has degree @xmath8 given that the other end node has degree @xmath9 , by @xmath11 . in a given step of the evolution the probability of a node of degree @xmath8 to be chosen",
