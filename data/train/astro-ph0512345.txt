    "despite its remarkable regularity over more than 12 orders of magnitude in energy , the cosmic - ray ( cr ) spectrum exhibits a few features that are subject to intense observational and theoretical studies , as they may provide valuable information to eventually understand the origin of both galactic ( gcrs ) and extragalactic ( egcrs ) cosmic - rays . along with the so - called knee around @xmath5  ev ,",
    "whose precise energy and composition structure is not firmly established yet @xcite , and the expected , but observationally uncertain , suppression at high energies due to cr interactions with the cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) , the energy range between @xmath6 and @xmath7  ev is of particular interest since it is believed to host the transition from gcrs to egcrs .",
    "such a transition must indeed occur as it is established ( notably from observations of galactic gamma - rays due to @xmath8 cr interactions ) that the low - energy crs have a galactic origin , while simple considerations about the confinement of particles in the galaxy and the galactic halo strongly suggest that most of the highest - energy crs must have an extragalactic origin ( unless their charge is unexpectedly large , which is not favoured by the observations ) .",
    "the most natural shape that a transition between two steady ( featureless ) components may take _ a priori _ is that of an ",
    "ankle, i.e. , a hardening of the spectrum , where the harder , initially subdominant component at low energy simply takes over from the softer component at _ some _ transition energy , @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , a `` knee - like '' transition corresponding to a steepening of the spectrum with no associated discontinuity is _ a priori _ unlikely , since it can be smooth only if the second component starts ( roughly ) at the energy where the first one stops _ and _ if at that energy they have ( roughly ) the same flux .",
    "interestingly , an ankle is indeed observed in the cr spectrum , around @xmath10  ev , precisely in the energy range where the confining effect of the galactic magnetic fields is expected to lose its efficiency ( because the gyroradius of the particles of charge @xmath11 in a microgauss field , @xmath12 , becomes comparable to the thickness of the galaxy ) and the gcr component is thus expected to die out .",
    "it is thus tempting to interpret the observed ankle as a natural signature of the gcr / egcr transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the @xmath6 to @xmath7  ev energy range ,",
    "another feature in the egcr spectrum is expected , if one assumes that the egcr sources only accelerate protons . in this case , the energy losses associated with the production of e@xmath13e@xmath14 pairs during the proton transport through the cmb lead to a so - called `` pair production dip '' in the propagated spectrum @xcite , the shape of which is reminiscent of the cr ankle . from this point of view",
    ", the ankle can be interpreted as a signature of a pure proton egcr component @xcite , in which case the gcr / egcr transition must occur at a lower energy , possibly around the so - called `` second knee '' that may be present in the data but with an uncertain energy scale .",
    "some support for such an interpretation can be found in the recent results of the hires experiment @xcite reporting a rapid variation of the depth of cr - induced extensive air showers ( eas ) , interpreted as a change of composition from heavy ( typically iron ) to light nuclei ( protons ) , between @xmath15 and @xmath6 ev , i.e. , below the ankle . a key assumption in the interpretation of the ankle as",
    "a pair production dip is the effective absence of nuclei heavier than hydrogen among egcrs , not only by the time they reach the earth but also at their source @xcite .",
    "another important parameter of the egcr source scenario is the logarithmic slope of the assumed power - law injection spectrum , @xmath16 . in a recent study @xcite ,",
    "we have drawn attention to the influence of the egcr source composition on both the interpretation of the ankle and the acceleration scenario .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : i ) if the sources accelerate only protons , then the observed high - energy cr spectrum can be well reproduced with a steep injection spectrum , @xmath172.7 @xcite , and the ankle can be interpreted as a pair - production dip , with a gcr / egcr transition @xmath18  ev ; ii ) if the egcr source composition is roughly similar to that of gcrs , i.e. , a substantial faction of heavier nuclei from the ambient medium around the source are accelerated together with protons , then the observed cr spectrum can be reproduced equally well with a less steep injection spectrum , @xmath192.3 , and the ankle can be interpreted as the gcr / egcr transition ( around @xmath10  ev ) .    while an ankle - like transition is",
    "_ a priori _ more natural than a knee - like transition , the rough coincidence between the end of the gcr component and the beginning of the egcr component may arise naturally around @xmath6  ev , as a result of the shortage of high - energy gcrs ( due to either acceleration or propagation effects ) and the suppression of low - energy egcrs because of expansion losses and/or magnetic field filtering @xcite . also , while a very steep spectrum and a discrimination of heavy nuclei by the acceleration process is _ a priori _ less natural , it has been claimed that strong extended magnetic fields around egcr sources might substantially increase the path of highly charged nuclei compared to protons and thus tend to suppress heavy nuclei , turning an originally mixed composition into an effective pure proton source , with a subsequent phenomenology similar to that of the genuinely pure - proton scenario @xcite .",
    "however that may be , we do not focus here on the theoretical plausibility of the different models , which remains somewhat subjective at this stage , but rather investigate the two main scenarios from the point of view of composition .",
    "in particular , we make definite predictions about observable features in the gcr / egcr transition region for both models and compare our results with the available data .    in sect .  2",
    ", we summarize the different composition hypotheses and briefly recall our standard scheme for the photo - disintegration of ultra - high - energy nuclei . in sect .  3 , we compare the propagated spectra obtained within the two main scenarios investigated , their implications for the remaining galactic component and the phenomenological limits of both models .",
    "we characterize the transition in terms of composition observables in sect .  4 and compare our results with the available data .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and conclude in sect .",
    "the effect of the cmb in the propagation of ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) nuclei in the intergalactic space was first discussed in the seminal papers by greisen @xcite and zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite where the well - known gzk cutoff was predicted .",
    "the first detailed study of the propagation of uhe nuclei heavier than protons can be found in @xcite ( see @xcite for an update ) , who showed that the main limiting process was the interaction of uhe nuclei with the cmb photons through the giant dipolar resonance ( gdr ) . since the energy threshold for this process roughly scales with the atomic number , @xmath20 ,",
    "it was realised that only iron ( or heavier ) nuclei could contribute significantly to the uhecr spectrum above @xmath21  ev . most of the following studies of uhe nuclei propagation then considered only iron @xcite or super - heavy nuclei @xcite , while only a few considered also low and intermediate mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that although the intermediate mass nuclei do not contribute substantially to the spectrum at the highest energies ( at least under the most standard assumptions ) , their influence can be noticeable in the ankle energy range , which is of particular interest to us here .",
    "as recalled above , we have shown recently that including these nuclei in the source composition radically changes the interpretation of egcr phenomenology by allowing the cr injection spectrum to be similar to that generally expected from relativistic shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "since the egcr composition is essentially unknown , we investigate two typical cases following the above - mentioned plausible scenarios for the gcr / egcr transition and the interpretation of the ankle .",
    "the first scenario is characterized by a mixed composition , with abundance ratios _ at the source _ similar to those of the much better known low energy crs ( model  a ) , and the second by a pure proton source ( model  b ) . for model",
    "a we use the values given @xcite , simply transforming the relative abundances , @xmath22 , at a given energy per nucleus ( @xmath23 ) into relative abundances at a given energy , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the injection spectral index of the source @xcite .",
    "the injection spectrum of each nuclear species , @xmath26 , is then given by @xmath27 which we refer to as our `` generic composition '' for the mixed - composition scenario .",
    "this scenario has a mild dependence on the egcr spectral index , but our results are found not to depend significantly on the details of the composition , at least within reasonable limits , as discussed below .",
    "likewise we consider some departure from the pure proton case by adding small fractions of he or fe nuclei , and study the validity domain of the pair - production dip interpretation of the ankle within this scenario .    concerning the high - energy end of the injection spectrum , we assume a simple exponential cut - off at some energy @xmath28 , and we assume that the acceleration mechanism is governed by rigidity - dependent processes , such that the maximum energy of a nucleus of charge @xmath29 is @xmath29 times higher than that of protons : @xmath30 .",
    "we use the typical value of @xmath31  ev , but study also the influence of this parameter .",
    "the egcr propagation is calculated by taking into account the main energy loss mechanisms for protons and nuclei due to the interaction with the cmb and the infra - red , optical and ultraviolet backgrounds ( ir / opt / uv ) .",
    "for the three latter , we used the latest estimates ( for the density and the cosmological evolution ) calculated by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the universal expansion losses and the pair production losses , both treated as continuous processes , we use a stochastic approach to describe the photo - production of pions in the case of protons propagating through the cmb and ir / opt / uv photon fields , as well as the four main photo - erosion processes for the propagation of uhe nuclei .",
    "the giant dipolar resonance ( gdr ) and the quasi - deuteron processes ( qd ) were considered in the seminal study of puget et al .",
    "for the gdr ( which is the main photo - dissociation process because of its lower energy threshold and larger cross - section ) , we use the new set of cross - sections recently calculated by @xcite , giving a much better description of the experimental data .",
    "this allows us to follow the propagation of all the nuclei in the two - dimensional @xmath32 nuclear space .",
    "in addition , we consider the processes of baryonic resonances ( br ) and photo - fragmentation ( pf ) , which contribute at the highest energies . although the gdr is the key process for the propagation of uhe nuclei , the br contribution to the photo - nuclear cross - sections has the important consequence of keeping the nuclei attenuation lengths at their lowest values even at very high energy where the influence of the gdr decreases .",
    "this is due to the corresponding large cross - sections and nucleon yields .",
    "a description of the relative influence of the four processes on the iron mean free path can be found in @xcite , where we also showed the evolution of the attenuation length as a function of energy .",
    "useful parameterizations of the qd , br and pf cross - sections can be found in @xcite .",
    "further details on our propagation code are given in @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that the extragalactic magnetic fields do not strongly influence the propagation of egcrs , and postpone until sect .  5 a short discussion about their possible effects .",
    "likewise , to limit the number of free parameters , we make the usual assumption that the egcr sources are distributed uniformly throughout the universe , with no significant evolution of their properties ( spectrum and intensity ) over the last few gigayears .",
    "equally good fits leading to a totally similar interpretation of the ankle can however be found with stronger evolution providing a slightly harder injection index ( 2.1 - 2.2 ) to compensate the higher contribution of far sources as in the pure proton case .",
    "it is important to note that nuclei heavier than protons are not disfavored by strong source evolution because the redshift evolution of the ir / opt / uv backgrounds @xcite is small compared to that of the cmb .",
    "the nuclei are thus not affected much by a change of the source evolution .",
    "a more detailed study of the effects induced by a stronger source evolution on the predicted spectrum can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also assume the simplest functional shape for the injection spectrum , namely a power law , @xmath33 , where the logarithmic slope , @xmath25 , is a free parameter",
    ". it should be noted , however , that in the case of a pure proton source composition , the value of @xmath25 necessary to fit the data ( namely @xmath342.7 ) is so large that one can not assume such a spectrum to hold down to thermal energies without running into an energy crisis , requiring an unreasonably large source power .",
    "for this reason , one must assume that the egcr injection spectrum somehow gets flatter at low energies , which introduces at least two additional free parameters , namely a break energy , @xmath35 , and the slope of the spectrum below that energy .",
    "this is further discussed below .",
    "such a complication is not met in the mixed - composition case , since the corresponding injection spectrum is flatter .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : spectramixedcompo ] and  [ fig : spectrapureprotons ] , we show the propagated spectra multiplied by @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) obtained with the two models described above , a and b. the injection spectral index and the source power are adjusted so as to provide a good fit of the high - energy cr data .",
    "we use separately the hires data @xcite and the akeno / agasa data @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "we shift the agasa energy scale down by @xmath38 to obtain a common normalization with akeno @xcite and to follow the recent re - analysis of agasa results @xcite .",
    "comparison with the auger spectrum @xcite gives the same results for the spectral fits and their interpretation , since the auger spectrum is consistent with both hires and agasa spectra within statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we shall not consider further the auger data here since no composition results are available yet .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectramixedcompo ] shows the results of our propagation code for a mixed egcr source composition ( model a ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",

    "if the excess flux at high energies is confirmed by higher statistics observations , it will require an additional component for both model a and model b. apart from this high - energy tail , the data suggest a source spectrum with a logarithmic slope for model a of @xmath40 , as with the hires data .    in both cases , we show the inferred galactic component , obtained by simply subtracting the egcr component from the observed data . in this scenario ,",

    "fig : spectrapureprotons ] , we show the propagated spectra obtained in two cases : i ) without a cut ( i.e. , implicitly with a cut below @xmath15  ev ) , and ii ) with a break in the spectrum at @xmath44  ev and a spectral index @xmath45 below the @xmath35 . in each case , we show the resulting galactic component necessary to account for the observed fluxes in the transition region . in the first case",
    "( no break ) , the egcr component appears to dominate down to @xmath46  ev if one refers to the hires data ( fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrapureprotons]a ) , or even down to below @xmath15  ev if one refers to the agasa data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrapureprotons]b ) .",
    "since the egcr component is made of protons only in this model , the case of no cut clearly implies a large fraction of protons at @xmath15  ev , larger than 20% for hires , or even 50% for agasa , which seems to be disfavoured by the recent results of the kascade experiment @xcite . in the second case ,",
    "when a low - energy cut is imposed on the egcr injection spectrum , it is clearly possible to reduce the extragalactic contribution to the total cr flux at @xmath15  ev .",
    "this reduction comes at the expense of a sharper gcr / egcr transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrapureprotons ] .    in both cases of model b and for any choice of data sets , the pair - production dip interpretation of the ankle implies that the gcr component has essentially died by @xmath6  ev , in contrast with the case of model a. the resulting composition structure at and below the ankle will thus be very different .",
    "the aim of this paper is to make definite predictions concerning the composition observables in this region and show how present and future data can be used to discriminate between model a and model b. note that if a low - energy cut is applied to model b , the transition must occur over an even shorter range of energy , namely less than half an order of magnitude , which implies a very sharp change of the observed cr composition , and thus a very large elongation rate .",
    "( the elongation rate , @xmath47 , is defined as the derivative of @xmath3 , the shower maximum , with respect to the logarithm of the energy , @xmath48 . )    finally , as mentioned above , sufficiently large extragalactic magnetic fields could lead to an additional suppression of the low - energy egcrs @xcite .",
    "however , this suppression would only make the transition sharper and it would mimic a low - energy break at the source even if there is none .      in the absence of a definite source model , the initial composition of the egcrs can not be predicted precisely . as shown above ,",
    "the data is consistent with a mixed composition similar to that of the better - known low - energy crs , as would result if the mechanisms by which the particles are injected into the acceleration process are similar in all sources .",
    "this behavior is expected for most mhd processes operating after a possibly selective injection correlated with physical parameters such as the volatility or the first ionisation potential of the different elements .",

    "[ fig : components]a .",
    "the figure shows how the pair - production dip , which is clear in the pure proton case , is weakened by the contribution of the other elements .",
    "this compensation by elements heavier than protons is the reason why a mixed composition leads to a completely different interpretation of the ankle and the gcr / egcr components .",
    "the figure also shows that he and intermediate mass nuclei ( cno , mg , si ) have their photo - erosion cutoffs , through interactions with the cmb , between 10 and 40  eev . as a consequence ,",
    "if these species were to dominate the egcr source composition , a significant cutoff in the observed spectrum would result .",
    "this essentially sets a lower limit to the fraction of protons at the source .",

    "compositions lighter or heavier than the generic one can give an equally accurate fit of the uhecr data .",
    "apart from lowering the proton abundance at the source , another way to have the he- and intermediate - mass - nuclei cutoffs appear in the propagated spectrum ( which would then drop at too low an energy ) is to reduce the maximum proton energy , @xmath28(p ) , at the source .",
    "this is shown if fig .",
    "[ fig : components]b , where we plot the propagated spectra obtained in the same conditions as in fig .  [ fig : spectramixedcompo]b , but with different values of @xmath28(p ) , namely @xmath52  ev , with @xmath51 , 20.0 , 20.2 and 20.5 .",
    "as can be seen , a proton maximum energy lower than @xmath53  ev would not be consistent with the hires data , even though heavier nuclei can still reach higher energies in this case since @xmath54 .",

    "although we assumed that the maximum energy of each species is proportional to their charge , it should be noted that once the proton cutoff at the source , @xmath28(p ) , is fixed , the predicted spectra are rather insensitive to the maximum energy of the other species .",
    "the rigidity dependent maximum energy is not critical for the viability of the model , but adjustments to the spectral index or proton fraction maybe necessary as one relaxes the rigidity dependent maximum energy assumption .",
    "for example , if the maximum energy reached by nuclei heavier than protons is low ( for example , @xmath55 ev , for @xmath56 due to photo - dissociation at the source ) , no high energy secondaries are produced leading to the flattening of the spectrum at high energies . in this case a slightly higher proton fraction than the 40% assumed or a harder injection spectrum would be required to fit the observed spectra .    , for uniformly distributed sources injecting energetic protons with a spectrum @xmath57 ( model b ) .",

    "all the curves are normalized to hires data at @xmath7 ev.,title=\"fig : \" ]      finally , we turn to the limits of model b , i.e. , the conditions under which the ankle can be interpreted as a pair - production dip .",
    "the main motivation for this interpretation is the similarity of the shapes between the predicted dip and the observed ankle .",
    "this similarity holds as long as the egcr component is made of protons only at the source , rather than a mixture of ambient material , i.e. , either primordial gas or some gas enriched by standard galactic chemical evolution .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study how the shape of the pair production dip evolves when one includes heavier nuclei at the source .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fehepollution]a , we show propagated spectra obtained for model b ( pure proton sources and @xmath34 ) and an additional component of fe with the same injection spectrum .",
    "the fraction of fe indicated on the plot is simply the relative abundance of iron at the source at a given energy .",
    "we considered three cases : no fe at all , 15% and 25% of fe .",
    "as can be seen , increasing the fraction of fe leads to a weakening of the spectrum curvature in the ankle region .",
    "the reason for such a flattening is that the fe spectral shape in this energy range is mostly affected by adiabatic losses only and therefore keeps its original shape ( @xmath57 ) . even for small fractions of fe",
    ", the pair - production dip interpretation does not fit the spectrum @xcite , requiring an additional galactic component to reproduce the shape of the ankle .",
    "similarly , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fehepollution]b that the pair production dip and the global shape of the spectrum are rapidly modified when he nuclei are added to the ecgr source composition .",
    "he fractions higher than @xmath58 15% at fixed energies strongly modify the position and the amplitude of the expected features , which is a relatively low he injection fraction .",
    "for instance , if @xmath58 7 - 8% he primordial abundance is injected into an accelerator that generates a spectrum @xmath59 , @xmath58 30% he fraction would be produced per fixed energy . for a steeper spectrum",
    "the fraction would be larger . and",
    "if the injected material is from an interstellar medium similar to that of the milky way , the fraction of heavier nuclei would be much higher .    while it is customary to think of he nuclei as representing roughly 10% of the crs at low energies ( say , around 10  gev / n ) , this corresponds to the relative normalization of the differential spectra in _ energy - per - nucleons_. if one considers the spectra of the different elements at a given _ energy _ , as we do here ( and as it is usually done at and above the knee ) , the actual `` he fraction '' is much larger .",
    "for instance , at energies below the proton knee , the fraction of helium estimated by combining observations of a number of detectors and a rigidity dependent knee ranges from @xmath58 30% to 50% @xcite .",
    "kascade observations @xcite , for any choice of hadronic models used to interpret the data , give larger he than proton abundances at the knee ( @xmath60  ev ) , and even larger above the knee , since the proton flux breaks earlier than the he component .",
    "a fraction of 15% of he can be considered unexpectedly small for egcr sources , even if the accelerated material is not enriched by stellar or explosive nucleosynthesis , such as primordial gas , if the source spectrum is steeper than that of gcrs as required for model b. a break in the source spectrum at energies below @xmath6  ev does not alleviate the difficulties , since the break is likely to be rigidity dependent and to occur at energies two times lower for protons than for he nuclei .    in sum , from the phenomenological point of view , model b requires a significant rejection of nuclei other than protons , including primordial he nuclei .",
    "how this may be achieved by the acceleration mechanism remains an open question . in principle , electromagnetic mechanisms do not distinguish between charged nuclei of the same rigidity , so the required discrimination must be found elsewhere , for example , in a strong radiation field around the source and/or a highly magnetized local medium . here",
    "we focus on the different models from the point of view of their predictions for the spectrum and composition features , and leave the problem of possible sources to future studies .",
    "we now turn to the study of the high - energy cr composition and the evolution of the composition - related observables with energy , as predicted by models a and b as compared to the available data .",
    "there are two main composition observables .",
    "the first one is the so - called `` @xmath3 '' , defined as the grammage , in g/@xmath62 , measured along the shower development axis ( from space to the ground ) , at which the maximum development of the shower is reached , i.e. , the position where the number of secondary particles produced in the electromagnetic cascade is largest .",
    "@xmath3 can be measured for each shower by experiments detecting the emission of fluorescence light in the wake of the shower ( due to the recombination of the ionized air ) , such as fly s eye , hires , and auger .",
    "showers induced by high - energy particles can develop for a longer time in the atmosphere before fading away , and thus have larger @xmath3 values than showers induced by lower - energy crs .",
    "conversely , heavy nuclei have a smaller interaction length than protons in the atmosphere and thus produce showers that develop earlier ( on average ) , resulting in smaller values of @xmath3 . while the predicted values of @xmath3 for a given nucleus at a given energy is model dependent , their variation with the mass and energy of the incident particle provides an useful observable to constrain the evolution of the high - energy cr composition with energy .",
    "as defined above , the evolution of @xmath3 with energy is called the elongation rate .",
    "the second observable is accessible to high - energy cr detectors that measure the distribution of the particles on the ground , including muons , such as akeno / agasa .",
    "it is based on the estimation of the muon content of the showers , which is expected to be larger for heavier progenitors , due to the larger contribution of the hadronic cascade relative to the electromagnetic one .",
    "while a clear identification of the energetic nuclei is quite hard to obtain with such a technique , one may estimate the average mass of the incident crs ( or its logarithm , @xmath61 ) , and measure its variation as a function of energy .",

    "this point depends slightly on the assumed source evolution as strong evolution can flatten the required injection spectrum .",

    "finally , the @xmath3 evolution gets steeper again as the composition gets lighter , due to the suppression of heavier components at the onset of their photo - disintegration processes with the cmb ( beginning with he nuclei ) .    as shown in fig .",

    "both models appear to be able to reproduce the high - energy cr data equally well , although with a different source spectrum and a correspondingly different interpretation of the ankle . within model a , the source spectrum is typically in @xmath98 , and the ankle marks the transition from gcrs to egcrs . within model",

    ".    it should be acknowledged , however , that the composition measurement remain difficult at high energy , and in particular the absolute normalisation of the @xmath3 observable is hadronic - model dependent .",
    "while the predictions of model a are in excellent quantitative agreement with the current data , an important result of our study is that the _ shape _ of the energy evolution of @xmath3 is also very different between both models . a distinctive prediction of model a is the presence of an `` s '' feature in the @xmath3 curve , corresponding to `` delay in lightening '' of the high - energy crs , directly related to the heavy nuclei accelerated at the sources .",
    "this feature may be tested by future , higher - statistics experiments such as auger , ( to some extent ) independently of the assumed hadronic interaction model .",
    "the understanding of the origin of the ankle is very important for the phenomenology of not only the ultra - high - energy crs , but also the galactic ones .",
    "we wish to stress here that it can not be obtained by the study of the sole spectrum , but benefits a lot from composition studies .",
    "it was the purpose of this paper to derive general predictions within the framework of two important and recently discussed models , independently of any consideration about their plausibility or the actual sources and acceleration mechanism involved .",
    "we argued elsewhere that model a is from our point of view more natural than model b , because i ) a mixed - composition source is expected for processes accelerating particles out of the interstellar medium , ii ) a source spectrum in @xmath98 seems easier to interpret ( notably in terms of relativistic shock acceleration ) than a steeper spectrum in @xmath99 , which would also lead to an energetics problem if not cut at low - energy , and iii ) an ankle - like feature is _ a priori _ natural for a transition between two cr components .",
    "however , we should not underestimate the argument that the ankle is very well reproduced by a single component of extragalactic protons over its whole energy range , with a very limited number of free parameters @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless note here that the pure proton model meets some difficulties to account for the available composition measurements .",
    "it is a fact , however , that the experimental data are still quite uncertain and do not lead to a completely coherent picture above @xmath6  ev , even though they all favour a significant fraction of non - proton nuclei at the ankle and a smooth gcr.egcr transition .",
    "future experiments with larger statistics and higher resolution will be needed to fully understand the origin of the ankle : kascade - grande @xcite should be able to measure the spectrum and constrain the composition above @xmath15  ev , where the transition is expected to begin for the two models ; and the pierre auger observatory will be able to measure the elongation rate above @xmath102  ev using the hybrid detection technique with a very high statistics above @xmath7  ev . the joint use of the fluorescence and ground array techniques will also be crucial to constrain the hadronic models , which are key to detailed understanding of the high - energy cr composition . furthermore , the very high expected statistics coupled with the full sky coverage provided by the two sites of the auger ( north and south ) should reveal the sources of uhecrs and thus provide the last ingredient necessary to the understanding of their origin .    finally , we briefly comment on the possible influence of extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) , which have been neglected here .",
    "definite predictions can not be proposed , mostly because we still lack strong constraints from both observational and theoretical studies about the strength , the coherence length and the structure of the egmf ( see for instance the large differences obtained for similar approches of magnetic fields in large scale structures : @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , however , we noted above that a magnetic horizon effect is expected at low energy ( @xcite ) , which could affect the extragalactic spectrum and make the gcr / egcr transition sharper .",
    "this would thus amplify the specific features of model b described above , and possibly make it even more difficult for it to account for the composition - related data .",
    "likewise , in the case of model a , the magnetic horizon would be rigidity - dependent and thus show at higher energy for heavier nuclei .",
    "the mixed composition would thus get heavier with increasing energy ( with the heaviest nuclei entering the horizon at higher energy ) , which could partly ( depending on the intensity of the magnetic field ) counterbalance the steepening of the @xmath3 evolution curve discussed above in the case of a pure proton composition , and also make the characteristic `` s '' shape of model a more pronounced if heavy nuclei start becoming abundant in the mixed composition regime ( corresponding to the flattening of the @xmath3 evolution ; see above ) . in any case , whatever the effect of the hypothetic magnetic horizon , it would not lead to a confusion between the predictions of models a and b since the energy scale of the transition would still remain different .",
    "furthermore the expected @xmath3 features ( steep - flatter - steep ) should remain present unless nuclei enter the horizon at energies above their photo - disintegration threshold , which would require quite a large egmf ( larger than used in @xcite ) . a large egmf could also increase the path length of the uhe nuclei at high energy , as studied in @xcite and thus shift the photo - disintegration cut - off of the different types of nuclei to a lower energy . however , as we have shown above , the predicted spectrum is not very sensitive to the presence of nuclei at the highest energies . in the case of our generic composition",
    ", the proton component already represents @xmath103 of the total flux at @xmath104  ev , and a lighter composition could thus provide a similarly good fit of the data . in conclusion , although strong extragalactic magnetic fields would certainly have some impact on the phenomenology of the high - energy crs , our general results should not be strongly affected .",
