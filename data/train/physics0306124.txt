    "h1 is an experiment at the electron proton collider hera at desy ( germany ) , which started collecting data in 1992 .",
    "essential parts of the analysis software architecture as well as the basic data model were established ten years ago . like",
    "most of the high energy physics experiments at that time h1 used fortran based packages such as bos @xcite and fpack for data storage and access .",
    "physics analysis were performed on so - called n - tuples using hbook @xcite and paw @xcite .",
    "after the hera and h1 upgrade in the year 2000 , the increased luminosity put new demands on data storage and data handling .",
    "therefore , the h1 collaboration has decided to move towards a new technology and to develop an analysis environment which should :    * lower turn around time for physics analysis * provide a unique , modern , extendable and re - usable framework * incorporate and support all h1 physics analyses * standardize the physics algorithms , e.g.  kinematic reconstruction , selection criteria , particle identifications etc . *",
    "provide one unique code reference and therefore facilitate exchange of information between different analysis groups * make expert knowledge reusable by non - experts and lower the threshold of starting a new analysis * provide a faster , more efficient access to the data * make doing analyses in h1 more attractive to students    to cope with these requirements , the h1 collaboration chose to base its analysis software on the object oriented analysis framework root @xcite .",
    "root is based on c++ and provides software for all aspects related to physics analysis ( i.e. processing , storing and visualizing data ) .",
    "in addition a c++ interpreter allows interactive use of the framework within the same scripting language .",
    "in order to standardize physics analysis and to take full advantage of the new partial event reading capability of the root framework a four layer data structure has been implemented .    * * ods ( @xmath0 ) : * this layer is a 1 - 1 copy of the reconstruction output formerly called data summary tape ( dst ) .",
    "it contains reconstructed tracks , clusters as well as important detector informations . even though this layer can be stored persistently",
    ", the standard is to produce it transiently from dst .",
    "this way people doing analysis in the old and those using the new framework can work in parallel without having to store the same information twice .",
    "the size of ods objects is of the order of 13 kb / event . *",
    "* @xmath1ods ( @xmath2 ) : * on @xmath1ods 4-vectors of physical particles and particle candidates are stored ( see fig .",
    "[ muods ] ) .",
    "the sum of all particle candidates provides a 4 @xmath3 coverage of the solid angle around the reconstructed vertex and there is no double counting of energy .",
    "each of the particles stores also a pointer to the ods - tracks and clusters that it was build from .",
    "+ the identified , physical particles contain all particle information and some specific detector informations that was used to identify the particle or that might be necessary for further specification during physics analysis .",
    "composed particles ( as for example jets or j / psi particles ) are stored in a special class containing pointers to the related particle candidates or identified particles . with the provided information ,",
    "the @xmath1ods is largely sufficient for most analysis purposes",
    ". a mean amount of 3 kb / event has been achieved . *",
    "* hat : * the hat ( h1 analysis tag ) contains event summary level information , such as event kinematics and particle multiplicities .",
    "all variables are stored as basic types . the main purpose it to allow a fast event selection ( `` tagging '' ) for each of the physics analysis .",
    "the size is 0.4 kb / event .",
    "* * usertree : * to persistenly store user specific information that is not already stored on official data layers a so - called `` user - tree '' is supported by the framework .    the ods layer is filled transiently using dst information only .",
    "the @xmath1ods is filled by the physics algorithm detailed in the section [ physics_algo ] .",
    "new @xmath1ods and hat are centrally produced whenever new analysis algorithms or calibration results are available .",
    "the data access is implemented in a set of skeleton classes which were developed by following the three main requirements :    * the user has only one single event loop ( synchronization of the different layers is transparent to the user ) * a transparent access to the different levels of the data : smart accessor functions allow to retrieve information about event and particle attributes across boundaries of different files , e.g. @xmath1ods - to - ods . *",
    "the access to the data is partial , e.g. accessing a cluster on ods from @xmath1ods should not require to read the full ods event .",
    "these requirements are implemented in the class h1tree and some helper classes by using different root trees in parallel , one for each storage level .",
    "one of these helper classes is h1eventlist which is based on the root teventlist and facilitates the access to events according to user selection .",
    "h1eventlist allows to cumulate different selections and to select data on each layer .",
    "as h1 is a running experiment with an increasing flow of new data , it is essential that the quality and precision of these physics analysis be sustained . therefore the first goal was , while learning from the already existing algorithms in fortran , to develop and implement algorithms in the new framework with better performances than the old ones . to ensure quality and extendibility of the new analysis software ,",
    "a modular organization of loosely physics algorithms is essential .",
    "the aim is to allow for routines developed in particular user analyses to be integrated in the official production code and in addition to facilitate the physics analysis and to lower the turn - around time for beginners .",
    "modularity and portability is a prerequisite for the goal that the best knowledge of all physics working groups in h1 be propagated into one common framework .",
    "the interface between the filling code and the physics algorithms is structured such that the addition of new algorithms involves minimal changes to the software .",
    "technically the algorithms are implemented in separate classes that obey the same interface .",
    "the running is divided into two steps :    * first , the particle finders reconstruct the identified particles and the particle candidates using ods objects only . * in a second step , the composed particle identifiers run on the already reconstructed particles .",
    "the first category of finders comprises an electron , muon , hadron and photon finder .",
    "they are based on the already existing algorithms in fortran and show the same performances in terms of quality and precision . in the second category of finders , a jet finder using a @xmath4 algorithm as well as a j/@xmath5 , a @xmath6 and k@xmath7",
    "have been implemented and validated . in future ,",
    "new particle finder could easely be integrated in the new scheme and the existings ones are continuously be improved .",
    "a new event display has been developed .",
    "it is an application based on the new physics analysis framework and thus allows for the direct dialogue between the analysis part ( e.g. event selection and histogramming ) and visual inspection of events .",
    "the display was originally derived from the alice 3d root display .",
    "thanks to the root run time information ( rtti ) , objects on the screen can be picked and inspected , thus accessing the physics information .",
    "graphics sliders can be used to apply selections such that only relevant objects for a certain analysis are displayed .",
    "a new feature is the possibility to display the particle 4-vectors stored on @xmath1ods on top of the detector objects .",
    "for instance , one could display the 4-vectors of particles ( different particle types are displayed in different colours ) on top of the detector information and require minimum transverse momentum for all particles by moving a graphic slider .",
    "one advantage of the new display is his full backward compatibility to the old 2d command - line base program based on look @xcite .",
    "existing code containing expert knowledge about detector details is reused , thus fully integrating the functionality of the previous display .",
    "a new parser for the look-macro language was written in c++ .",
    "it is possible to display event information stored in root files as well as information stored in the former dst format .",
    "raw information , like for example the hit information of a reconstructed track , could therefore easely be retrieved .",
    "the new program combines modern features , such as the gui , the click and inspect options and the 3d - display with the advantages of the old display .",
    "a new analysis framework based on object oriented programming techniques has been succesfully introduced .",
    "the key to this success was the clear definition of the scope of the project :    * a code development group takes care of the technical challenges , such as encapsulation of the data handling .",
    "the physics working groups develop algorithms and add their code via well defined interfaces .",
    "the main reconstruction algorithms have been implemented , tested and validated . *",
    "the end users obtain a nice and easy - to - use product integrating all analysis specific tools into one single framework .    the physics analysis all greatly profit from the new and enhanced analysis environment .",
    "the framework is widely accepted within the collaboration : almost all of the new starting analyses are based on the framework .",
    "it is in addition used for the official data quality checks .",
