    "understanding bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of interacting particles is one of the most interesting problems in condensed matter physics @xcite . for uniform three - dimensional systems repulsion between the bosons depletes the condensate , while attraction leads to the condensate instability seen as the appearance of bogoliubov modes with imaginary frequencies . for the finite - size condensates",
    "this instability can be seen in their collapse @xcite .",
    "the collapse , where the size of the state goes to zero after a finite time , strongly depends on the spatial dimension @xmath0 and is possible only in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates .",

    "the main features of the collapse of a free , not restricted by an external potential , condensate , are determined by the interplay of its positive quantum kinetic and negative attraction energies dependent on the characteristic size of the condensate @xmath3 .",
    "the kinetic energy is proportional to @xmath4 while the attraction contribution behaves as @xmath5 . for @xmath2",
    "the dependence of the total energy on @xmath3 is non monotonic and the collapse with @xmath6 occurs at any interaction strength since at small @xmath3 the attraction dominates @xcite . for @xmath1",

    "the bec physics becomes much richer with synthetic gauge fields @xcite and synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "for the latter , optically produced atomic pseudospin @xmath7 is coupled to atomic momentum and to a synthetic magnetic field .",
    "the soc can be produced in various forms , simulating the rashba and the dresselhaus symmetries [ ] known in solid state physics .",
    "this coupling opens a venue to the appearance of new phases in a variety of ultracold bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite ensembles .",
    "it is well appreciated that the soc plays crucial role in bec physics in uniform three - dimensional gases with interparticle repulsion @xcite .",
    "for @xmath1 the phases of the bec of repelling bosons trapped in a harmonic potential were found in ref .",
    "one of the advantages of cold atomic gases is the fact that due to a very large particle wavelength compared with the atomic radius , the interatomic interaction can be accurately described by a single parameter , the scattering length @xmath8 where positive ( negative ) @xmath9 corresponds to repulsion ( attraction ) between the atoms .",
    "the attraction can be achieved by means of the feshbach resonance @xcite in a certain range of the system parameters . here",

    "the numerically obtained critical value of @xmath50 here is approximately @xmath130 and @xmath131 shows a linear rather than a square - root behavior near the collapse time .",

    "the velocity of the collapse is @xmath139 at @xmath140 @xmath135 and @xmath141 this estimate yields @xmath142 cm / s and the corresponding time scale @xmath143 s. such a small value of @xmath144 demonstrates that even a relatively weak experimentally achievable coupling @xcite can prevent the bec from collapsing . at these conditions , the characteristic distance between the particles @xmath145 @xmath135 is much larger than @xmath146 @xmath147 still preventing a strong depletion of the condensate .    to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated that the anomalous spin - dependent velocity determined by the spin - orbit coupling strength can prevent collapse of a nonuniform quasi two - dimensional bec @xcite .",
