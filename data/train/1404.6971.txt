    "the compact companions of hot subluminous stars are difficult to detect in optical / uv data . however , they might give rise to detectable x - ray emission if the subdwarf can provide an adequate accretion rate . in this respect ,",
    "luminous sdo stars offer the best prospects for x - ray detections because of their high mass loss rates ( @xmath2 yr@xmath3 ; jeffery & hamann , 2010 ) .",
    "this is well demonstrated by the case of the luminous sdo hd 49798 , a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( p=1.5 days ) from which soft x ",
    "rays were discovered with the rosat satellite .",
    "remarkably , the x - ray flux shows a strong periodic modulation at 13.2 s ( israel et al . , 1997 ) , indicating the presence of a compact object .",
    "x - ray eclipses ( which constrains the system inclination ) allowed a dynamical measurement of the masses of the two binary components .",
    "this showed that the companion of hd 49798 is a very massive ( 1.28@xmath40.05 @xmath5 ) white dwarf ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2009 , 2011a , 2013 ) , and qualifies this binary as a potential progenitor of a type ia supernova .",
    "prompted by the case of hd 49798 , a search for x - ray emission from other hot subdwarfs was launched . while searches with the swift / xrt of candidate sdb+wd binaries gave negative results ( mereghetti et al .",
    ", 2011b ) , pulsed x  ray emission in the luminous , hydrogen - deficient sdo bd+37@xmath0442 was discovered ( la palombara et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "the observed x - rays have a soft spectrum ( a blackbody with temperature @xmath645 ev plus a weak power - law component ) , and show a significant modulation at a period of 19.2 s ( see fig [ lc ] ) .",
    "the best fit x - ray luminosity is @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 ( for a distance of 2 kpc ; bauer & husfeld , 1995 ) , but , due to the uncertainties in the x - ray blackbody temperature , the bolometric x - ray luminosity could be between @xmath8 and @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the detection of pulsations indicates the presence of a wd or a neutron star , most likely powered by accretion from the stellar wind of bd+37@xmath0442 , which is losing mass at a rate of @xmath63@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath5 yr@xmath3 and with a wind terminal velocity of v@xmath12=2,000kms@xmath3 ( jeffery & hamann , 2010 ) . assuming a canonical wind velocity law and bondi - hoyle accretion , la palombara et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that a neutron star orbiting bd+37@xmath0442 with a period of less than ten days ( for a circular orbit ) would accrete from the wind at a sufficiently high rate to produce the observed x - rays .",
    "the companion could be a white dwarf only if the system were much tighter allowing roche - lobe overflow .",
    "we obtained 41 high - resolution spectra in the second half of 2012 using the cafe spectrograph at calar alto observatory ( 27 spectra ) and the sarg spectrograpgh at the tng ( la palma , 14 spectra ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of bd+37@xmath0442 is dominated by lines , with no traces of hydrogen balmer line blends .",
    "many lines of carbon ( and ) can be identified hinting at a carbon - rich composition .",
    "a few lines are in emission , most notably @xmath13 5695.92 .",
    "we adopted a he / h ratio of 100:1 by number and carried out a quantitative spectral analysis of the helium line spectrum using nlte model atmospheres , which resulted in an effective temperature t@xmath14 = 56300k and surface gravity @xmath15 = 4.1 .",
    "additional line broadening has to be invoked in order to match the observed line profiles by synthetic ones which hinted at a projected rotational velocity of 60 kms@xmath3 .",
    "however , because we used static models , the line broadening could be ( partly ) due to dynamic phenomena such as macroturbulence or the stellar wind .",
    "most other hot subdwarfs are known to be slow rotators with projected rotational velocities of less than 30kms@xmath3 ( hirsch & heber , 2009 ) for apparently single sdo stars and less than 10kms@xmath3 ( geier & heber , 2012 ) for single sdb stars .",
    "hence bd+37@xmath0442 may rotate faster than expected .",
    "however , the sdo star could have been spun up by a compact companion .",
    "if the rotation of the sdo star should be tidally locked to its orbit , the period must be of the order of 1 day .",
    "the orbital period of bd+37@xmath0442 is unknown since radial velocity measurements are scarce .",
    "drilling & heber ( 1987 ) report a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath1694@xmath41 kms@xmath3 .",
    "radial velocity variations have not been noted in the literature . as outlined above",
    ", we expect the orbital period to be of the order of a few hours to ten days .",
    "therefore we embarked on a time series of optical spectra .",
    "radial velocities were derived from helium , carbon and nitrogen lines and are displayed in fig .  [ rv ] .",
    "no radial velocity variations were found on the time scales of hours , days , weeks or months at a level of few kms@xmath3 .",
    "the mean velocity is perfectly consistent with that measured by drilling & heber ( 1987 ) .",
    "the level of x - ray emission from bd+37@xmath0442 could be explained by accretion from the sdo wind by a neutron star orbiting at a period of less than ten days .",
    "therefore it seemed likely that bd+37@xmath0442 is a binary similar to hd 49798 and that the orbital period is also similar to that of the latter ( 1.55 d ) .",
    "if the companion to bd+37@xmath0442 were a white dwarf , short period variations are expected to explain the level of the x - ray flux through accretion via roche lobe overflow .",
    "hence the companion is more likely a neutron star .",
    "however , our time series spectroscopy did not reveal any radial velocity variations at the expected period and amplitude range .",
    "possible explanations for the lack of rv variations are    * bd@xmath137@xmath0442 is not a binary at all . then the origin of the x - ray pulses remains a mystery .",
    "the similarity to hd  49798 , however , suggests that bd@xmath137@xmath0442 is a binary too , and the pulsed x - ray emission is due to rotation of the accreting neutron star . *",
    "the orbital plane of bd@xmath137@xmath0442 is almost perpendicular to the line of sight . in this case",
    "the rotation axes of the sdo star as well as of the x - ray emitting companion must be strongly inclined w.r.t .",
    "the orbital plane . *",
    "the orbital period is very long ( years ) and the orbit strongly eccentric .",
    "a radial velocity campaign of much longer duration would be needed .",
    "x - ray emission is predicted to occur close to periastron only .      based on observations collected at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) at calar alto , operated jointly by the max - planck institut fr astronomie and the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( csic) and on observations made with the italian telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng )",
