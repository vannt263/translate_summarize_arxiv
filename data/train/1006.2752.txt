    "soon after the first repressor protein had been discovered by franois jacob and jacques lucien monod in 1961  @xcite , theoretical work on gene regulation started @xcite .",
    "typically , a realistic modelling of gene regulation systems includes rate equations for the concentrations of the participating macromolecules , i.e. , mrna and proteins . in vivo experiments permitted to obtain quantitative data for regulatory processes and their kinetic parameters , and they provided important insight into regulatory dynamics .",
    "thus , elowitz and leibler  @xcite designed and constructed a synthetic network out of three transcriptional repressor systems to build an oscillating network , termed the repressilator , in escherichia coli . in recent years , the field of systems biology has emerged , which aims at a quantitative description of cell behavior and basic dynamic processes , and which permits to analyze systems such as gene regulation networks .    besides detailed quantitative approaches , the general features of regulatory and signaling processes in living cells also gave rise to a minimalist dynamical description as boolean networks , where the state of each gene is either `` on '' or `` off ''  @xcite .",
    "such a description is particularly useful when dealing with large networks @xcite , because it reduces the huge complexity of the continuous system with its many differential equations and parameters to a problem of logical structure which is easier to understand .",
    "it permits to study generic features of entire classes of systems @xcite , or to reproduce the correct sequence of events in gene regulation networks that must function reliably , such as cell cycle dynamics @xcite .",
    "so far , little is known about the general conditions under which a boolean simplification gives a realistic picture of the dynamics in gene regulation networks .",
    "in contrast to boolean networks , ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , which model the switch - like dynamics of genes by using sigmoidal hill functions , can include more detailed information about transcription and translation processes to evaluate the time course of the gene expression patterns .",
    "depending on the parameter values , such models can show oscillating behavior or a stable fixed point . even for small systems of only two genes ,",
    "the seems to be no simple relation between boolean and continuous models .",
    "widder et al .",
    "@xcite and polynikis et al .",
    "@xcite studied a two - gene activator - inhibitor network and investigated in detail the conditions under which a hopf bifurcation occurs , which leads to oscillating behavior .",
    "they found that oscillatory behavior is exhibited by the two - gene model only if the hill coefficents are above a certain threshold , and that the system can be driven through the bifurcation by varying the time scales of the mrna and proteins  @xcite .",
    "the boolean version of this system always shows oscillatory behavior .",
    "similar results can be found in del vecchio  @xcite , who included an additional self - input of one gene and varied the time - scale difference between the activator and the respressor and time - scale difference between the protein and mrna dynamics by using bifurcation analysis .",
    "they also obtained richer dynamical behavior incorporating mrna dynamics and could define a parameter space that leads to stable limit cycles .    in this paper , we present a general and comprehensive investigation of the two - gene network .",
    "gross and feudel  @xcite developed a method of _ generalized models _",
    ", which allows to investigate the stability of fixed points and the occurrence of bifurcations in dependence of general features of the system , without the need to specify the steady state or the regulatory functions .",
    "this approach enables us to unite all previous studies of this system within one framework , and to include also those situations that had not been studied before .",
    "this permits us to identify the main differences between the dynamical behavior and the attractor patterns of boolean and continuous models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ model ] , we introduce the dynamical equations and the generalized method used for the analysis . section  [ results ] presents the conditions for the occurrence of oscillations in the continuous model and compares these to the boolean model .",
    "finally , we discuss and compare our findings to previous studies in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "gene expression is the process by which genetic information is ultimately transformed into working proteins .",
    "the main steps are transcription from dna to mrna , translation from mrna to linear amino acid sequences and folding of these into functional proteins  @xcite",
    ". a certain class of proteins , called transcription factors , can bind to the dna to regulate the rate at which their target genes are transcribed into mrna .",
    "gene regulation thus involves a network of macromolecules that mutually influence each other .",
    "the production of proteins and mrna is balanced by degradation and dilution  @xcite .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]     the regulatory functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 can either have the same sign ( activator - activator or inhibitor - inhibitor ) or different signs ( activator - inhibitor complex ) . in a boolean model , an activating interaction is implemented by the boolean function `` copy '' , and a repressing interaction by `` invert '' . in the boolean version , the model has only four possible states , 00 , 01 , 10 , and 11 . for the activator - activator or inhibitor - inhibitor case",
    ", the boolean model has two fixed points and a cycle .",
    "the cycle alternates between 01 and 10 for the activator - activator , and between 00 and 11 for the inhibitor - inhibitor case . for the activator - inhibitor situation",
    ", the boolean model has a cycle that involves all four states : @xmath2 .",
    "we will see that the continuous model can display a cycle only in the activator - inhibitor situation , and only if the parameters are in the appropriate range .",
    "figure  [ varied_r_2d ] shows the regions in generalized parameter space where a fixed point is unstable against oscillations .",
    "the hopf bifurcations , which occur at the boundary between the white and the gray area , can be determined directly from the characteristic polynomial of the jacobian , which gives rise to only two eigenvalues .",
    "oscillations can only occur when the exponent parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 have different signs , i.e. , for the activator - inhibitor system .",
    "furthermore , the product of the hill coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 must be large enough . for larger time - scale ratio @xmath7 between mrna and protein dynamics",
    ", the exponent parameters must be larger to obtain a hopf bifurcation . for @xmath8 , where the mrna dynamics is quasi always in a steady - state",
    ", the activator - inhibitor network shows no oscillatory dynamics for exponent parameters @xmath3 , @xmath9 , corresponding to cooperativity coefficients @xmath10 . even though the generalized method uses normalised variables , the results",
    "can easily be compared to numerical simulations .",
    "figure  [ simu ] shows mrna and protein concentrations for different values of @xmath11 ( rows ) with @xmath12 ( first column ) and @xmath8 ( second column ) . as the separation of time scales between mrna and proteins becomes larger , the oscillation frequency increases , but the amplitude of the oscillations decreases ( @xmath13 ) or even vanishes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "in contrast to the boolean model , where the state of a gene jumps instantaneously from `` off '' to `` on '' and back , the concentrations in the continuous model always change smoothly , even in the limit @xmath15 , where the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 become step functions . for this reason , the oscillation that occurs in the boolean activator - activator ( or inhibitor - inhibitor ) system does not occur in the continuous model . only the two fixed points that are also present in the boolean model occur in the continuous model .",
    "for the same reason , the oscillation of the boolean activator - inhibitor system can occur in the continuous model only when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are steep enough in order to drive the concentrations sufficiently fast through the intermediate values .",
    "otherwise the system settles at the ( only ) fixed point , which is found at intermediate concentration values .",
    "+   +   +      figure  [ varied_r ] shows the generalization to the case @xmath16 of fig .  [ varied_r_2d ] .",
    "the hopf bifurcations were calculated using the method of resultants  @xcite .",
    "gray areas show regions in parameter space where the fixed point has a complex pair of unstable eigenvalues , with the other two eigenvalues being stable .",
    "figure  [ ebene ] shows a cross section at @xmath17 for @xmath12 .",
    "one sees again that a faster mrna dynamics leads to a smaller oscillatory region in parameter space . just as for the activator - inhibitor network ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 must have different signs to obtain a hopf bifurcation , corresponding to opposed regulatory functions .",
    "the additional self - input of gene  @xmath18 can be activating or repressing for @xmath12 , but must be activating for larger ratio of time scales ( e.g. @xmath8 ) to obtain oscillations .",
    "larger values of the exponent parameters , and therefore larger hill coefficients @xmath11 , can make up for a large ratio of time scales between mrna and protein dynamics , as in the system without additional self input .",
    "however , biologically realistic values of @xmath11 are in the range @xmath19  @xcite .    in order to compare the continuous model with the boolean model",
    ", we now specify the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be hillcubes . out of the 16 possible boolean functions of two variables for @xmath22",
    ", only 10 actually depend on the values of both variables .",
    "we discuss in the following these 10 functions and compare the boolean dynamics with the dynamics due to hillcubes .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case that @xmath18 activates @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the case that @xmath18 inhibits @xmath23 can always be mapped on the first case in a boolean model by inverting the states of nodes and changing the sign of the appropriate connections .",
    "the boolean functions @xmath18  and  @xmath23 and @xmath18  or  @xmath23 give rise to the fixed points 00 and 11 in the boolean model .",
    "using hillcubes , we obtain @xmath25 for both functions , which means that the continuous model can not have a hopf bifurcation .",
    "whether the continuous model has one or two stable fixed points , depends on the parameter values .",
    "the boolean functions not  @xmath18  and  @xmath23 and not  @xmath18  or  @xmath23 give rise to one fixed point ( 00 and 11 , respectively ) and one cycle involving the states 01 and 01 in the boolean model .",
    "using hillcubes , we obtain @xmath25 for both functions , which means that the continuous model can not have a hopf bifurcation .",
    "this situation is analogous to the activator - activator loop , where the cycle present in the boolean model does not occur in the continuous model .",
    "the boolean functions @xmath18  and  not  @xmath23 and @xmath18  or  not  @xmath23 give rise to one fixed point ( 00 and 11 , respectively ) , which is a global attractor , in the boolean model .",
    "using hillcubles , we obtain @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the signs of the exponent parameters are such that a hopf bifurcation is possible . when the concentration of transcribed mrna is projected onto a two - dimensional surface ( fig .",

    "apart from the signs of the regulatory interactions , the only relevant parameters in this general description are the hill coefficient and the time scale ratio between mrna and protein dynamics . by comparing the different types of interactions to two - node boolean models",
    ", we found that the occurrence of a cycle in the boolean model is neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of an oscillation in the continuous model .",

    "the two - gene system with three connections was studied by del  vecchio  @xcite , for the case @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath24 , by using generalized hill functions .",
    "the extensive bifurcation analysis shows that oscillations occur over a larger parameter range when the mrna dynamics is slower .",
    "this result is a special case of our very general result shown in fig .",
    "[ varied_r ] .",

    "@xcite , studied simple rings of four genes , and rings where one node has an additional self - input .",

    "they found that the time delay must be sufficiently large for oscillations to occur , which agrees with our finding that @xmath7 must be sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore , they found that continuous systems can exhibit stable oscillations in cases where boolean reasoning would suggest otherwise , and that on a ring periodic cycles of boolean systems do not exist in continuous systems when the oscillation is not stable against fluctuations in the update time .",
    "this finding is a generalization of the result described above that the two - gene activator - activator system has no oscillations . in a different publication  @xcite",
    ", they point out the importance of the detailed form of the continuous functions for obtaining nontrivial dynamical patterns .",
    "this finding is related to our finding that the hill coefficents @xmath11 must be sufficiently large for oscillations to occur .",
    "mochizuki  @xcite investigated random networks with larger numbers of nodes .",
    "he found that the number of different steady states increases with the number of self - regulatory genes .",
    "he furthermore found that many of the periodic oscillations observed in the boolean network are not present in the continuous model of gene regulatory networks and therefore the predictions of boolean models can become unrealistic or too complex for larger networks when compared to those of the corresponding ode models .",
    "the latter finding is conform with the findings for the simple two - gene model .",
    "when all these investigations are taken together , there appears to be no simple criterion for deciding whether a periodic dynamical behavior in a boolean model has an equivalent in a continuous model . in the examples investigated in this paper ,",
    "there are two cases where the periodic dynamics of the boolean model is `` reliable '' in the sense that fluctuations in the update times of the two nodes do not destroy the dynamical cycle .",
    "the first case is the activator - inhibitor system , the second is the nor and nand function .",
    "the corresponding continuous model has periodic oscillations whenenver the hill coefficients are large enough and the time scale of the mrna is slow enough .",
    "however , a reliable oscillation in the boolean model is not a necessary requirement for an oscillation in the continuous model , as shown for the xor and xnor functions ( where the oscillation in the boolean model is not reliable ) , and for the and not and or not functions , where the boolean model has a global fixed point .",
