    "in the framework of the standard model , the quark sector is characterized by a rich pattern of flavor - changing transitions , described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix : @xmath4 since the ckm matrix must be unitary , it can be expressed as a function of only four parameters .",
    "a commonly used approximate parameterization was originally proposed by wolfenstein @xcite .",
    "it reflects the hierarchy between the magnitude of matrix elements belonging to different generations .",
    "very frequently it is quoted in the approximation valid only to @xmath5 . we need to carry out this expansion further in order to incorporate cp violation in neutral @xmath6 decays .",
    "this expression , accurate to @xmath5 for the real part and @xmath7 for the imaginary part , is given by : @xmath8 the parameter @xmath9 is well measured as 0.2196@xmath100.0023 @xcite , constraints exist on @xmath11 and @xmath12 from measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath14 mixing .",
    "this report focuses on the magnitude of the ckm element @xmath0 , related to the wolfenstein parameter @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "two different methods have been used to extract this parameter from data : the * exclusive * measurement , where  is extracted by studying exclusive @xmath16 and @xmath17 decay processes ; and the * inclusive * measurement , which uses the semileptonic width of b - hadron decays .",
    "theoretical estimates play a crucial role in extracting @xmath0 and an understanding of their uncertainties is very important .",
    "the exclusive  determination is obtained studying the @xmath18 and @xmath17 decays , using heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , an exact theory in the limit of infinite quark masses .",
    "presently the @xmath17 transition provides a less precise value and is used as a check .",
    "hqet predicts that the differential partial decay width for this process , @xmath19 , is related to  through : @xmath20 and @xmath21 meson 4-velocities , @xmath22 is a known phase space factor and the form factor @xmath23 is generally expressed as the product of a normalization factor @xmath24 and a function , @xmath25 , constrained by dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "there are several different corrections to the infinite mass value @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 or @xmath29 . by virtue of luke",
    "s theorem @xcite , the first term in the non - perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath30 vanishes .",
    "@xmath31 corrections up to leading logarithmic order give @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath33 radiative corrections to two loops give @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "different estimates of the @xmath35 corrections , involving terms proportional to @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 have been performed in a quark model @xcite , @xcite , with ope sum rules @xcite , and , more recently , with an hqet based lattice gauge calculation @xcite .",
    "the value from this quenched lattice hqet calculation is @xmath39 .",
    "the errors quoted reflect the statistical accuracy , the matching error , the lattice finite size , the uncertainty in the quark masses and an estimate of the error induced by the quenched approximation , respectively .",
    "the central value obtained with ope sum rules is similar , with an error of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we will use @xmath41 @xcite .    the analytical expression of @xmath23 is not known a - priori , and this introduces an additional uncertainty in the determination of @xmath42 .",
    "first measurements of @xmath0 were performed assuming a linear approximation for @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this assumption is not justified and that linear fits systematically underestimate the extrapolation at zero recoil ( @xmath43 ) by about 3% .",
    "most of this effect is related to the curvature of the form factor , and does not depend strongly upon the details of the non - linear shape chosen @xcite .",
    "all recent published results use a non - linear shape for @xmath23 , approximated with an expansion around @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 is parameterized in terms of the variable @xmath45 , which is the slope of the form - factor at zero recoil of ref .",
    "@xcite .      the decay @xmath46 has been studied in experiments performed at the @xmath47 center of mass energy and at the @xmath48 center of mass energy at lep . at the @xmath47 ,",
    "experiments have the advantage that the @xmath49 resolution is quite good .",
    "however , they have more limited statistics near @xmath43 in the decay @xmath50 , because of the lower reconstruction efficiency of the slow pion , from the @xmath51 decay . the decay @xmath52 is not affected by this problem and cleo @xcite uses both channels .",
    "in addition , kinematic constraints enable @xmath53 experiments to identify the final state including the @xmath54 without a large contamination from the poorly known semileptonic decays including a hadronic system heavier than @xmath54 , commonly identified as ` @xmath55 ' . at lep , b s",
    "are produced with a large momentum ( about  30 gev on average ) .",
    "this makes the determination of @xmath49 dependent upon the neutrino four - momentum reconstruction , thus giving a relatively poor resolution and limited physics background rejection capabilities .",
    "by contrast , lep experiments benefit from an efficiency only mildly dependent upon @xmath49 .    experiments determine the product @xmath56 by fitting the measured @xmath57 distribution .",
    "measurements at the @xmath58 have been performed by cleo @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dslnu - cleo ] shows the latest cleo measurement @xcite of @xmath59 as a function of @xmath49 . at lep data are available from aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite and opal @xcite .",
    "delphi fits for @xmath60 , including a free - curvature parameter ; the result of this fit , fig .",
    "[ dd ] , agrees with the shape parameterization of @xcite , used by all experiments .",
    "both the cleo and delphi spectra are corrected for smearing , as well as for efficiency .    at lep ,",
    "the dominant source of systematic error is the uncertainty on the contribution to @xmath57 from semileptonic b decays with final states including a hadron system heavier than the @xmath21 , either narrow orbitally excited charmed meson or non - resonant or broad species .",
    "the existence of narrow resonant states is well established @xcite and a signal of a broad resonance has been seen by cleo @xcite , but the decay characteristics of these states in b - hadron semileptonic decays have large uncertainties . the average of aleph @xcite , cleo @xcite and delphi @xcite narrow state branching fractions show that the ratio @xmath61 is smaller than one ( @xmath62 at 95% c.l.@xcite ) , in disagreement with hqet models where an infinite quark mass is assumed @xcite , but in agreement with models which take into account finite quark mass corrections @xcite . hence , lep experiments use the treatment of narrow @xmath63 proposed in @xcite , which accounts for @xmath64 corrections . ref .",
    "@xcite provides several possible approximations of the form factors , that depend on five different expansion schemes and on three input parameters . to calculate the systematic errors each proposed scheme",
    "is tested , with the relevant input parameters varied over a range consistent with the experimental limit on @xmath65 .",
    "the quoted systematic error is the maximal difference from the central value obtained with this method .",
    "broad resonances or other non - resonant terms may not be modelled correctly with this approach .",
    ".experimental results as published by the collaborations .",
    "lep numbers use theoretical predictions for r@xmath66 and r@xmath67 .",
    "the published aleph result is obtained using a linear fit and the old isgur - wise model @xcite for @xmath63 . the updated aleph numbers ( used in our average )",
    "are obtained using the same fit parameterization and @xmath63 models as the other lep experiments @xcite .",
    "the belle result quoted here uses r@xmath66 and r@xmath67 from cleo data .",
    "[ t : publ ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     subtracting @xmath68 from the lep semileptonic branching fraction , we get : @xmath69 and using @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath71 where the systematic error @xmath72 reflects the @xmath73 uncertainty and the model dependence , correlated with the @xmath53 result .",
    "combining the lep and the @xmath53 semileptonic widths , we get : @xmath74 which is used in the formula of ref .",
    "@xcite to get : @xmath75 where the first error is experimental , the second from the measured value of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , assumed to be universal up to higher orders .",
    "the third error is from @xmath78 corrections and from the ambiguity in the @xmath79 scale definition .",
    "the error on the average b - hadron lifetime is assumed to be uncorrelated with the error on the semileptonic branching ratio .",
    "the values of @xmath80 obtained both from the inclusive and exclusive method agree within errors .",
    "the value of  obtained from the analysis of the @xmath81 decay is : @xmath82 where the first error is experimental and the second error is from the @xmath36 corrections to @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 , obtained from inclusive semileptonic branching fractions is : @xmath83 where the first error is experimental , the second error is from the measured values of @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , assumed to be universal up to higher orders , and the last from @xmath78 corrections and @xmath79 .",
    "non - quantified uncertainties are associated with a possible quark - hadron duality violation .",
    "for this reason , we chose not to average the two numbers .",
    "while experimental errors have reached @xmath84 and @xmath85 levels respectively , the dominant uncertainties remain of theoretical origin .",
    "thus an unambiguous statistical treatment of these uncertainties is very difficult .",
    "high precision tests of hqet , checks on possible violations of quark - hadron duality in semileptonic decays , experimental determination of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are needed to complete this challenging experimental program .",
