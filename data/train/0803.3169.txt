    "one of the primary motivations for studying the production of mesons off nucleons is to investigate the structure and properties of nucleon resonances and , in the case of heavy - meson productions , to learn about hadron dynamics at short range . in particular , a clear understanding of the production mechanisms of mesons heavier than the pion still requires further theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "apart from pion production , the majority of theoretical investigations of meson - production processes are performed within phenomenological meson - exchange approaches .",
    "such an approach forces us to correlate as many independent processes as possible within a single model if one wishes to extract meaningful physics information .",
    "indeed , this is the basic motivation behind the coupled - channels approaches .    in this paper",
    ", we present the result of our investigation of @xmath0-meson production in both the photon- and hadron - induced reactions , @xmath13 more specifically , we perform a combined analysis of the reactions , @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath15 based on an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the amount of data available for @xmath0-meson production is now considerable .",
    "in particular , in photoproduction processes off protons , a new generation of high - precision data are now available , not only for total and differential cross sections in a wide range of energies starting from threshold  @xcite but also for beam and target asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "taken in combination , these data sets offer better opportunities for investigating the properties of nucleon resonances .",
    "in particular , much more detailed studies than in the past are possible now for resonances that may perhaps couple strongly to @xmath16 but only weakly to @xmath17 . in this respect ,",
    "the recent data on the quasi - free @xmath18 process  @xcite have attracted much interest in @xmath0-production processes in connection to the possible existence of a narrow ( crypto - exotic ) baryon resonance with a mass near @xmath19  gev which is still under debate  @xcite . to date , the narrow bump structure in the @xmath20 reaction cross section was reported by several groups  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a narrow baryon resonance near @xmath19 gev has been also suggested earlier by several authors  @xcite .",
    "there are a large number of theoretical investigations of @xmath0 photoproduction , mostly from the early 1990s to the present  @xcite and , especially , off protons .",
    "most of them focus on the role of nucleon resonances and the extraction of the corresponding resonance parameters , but a variety of issues have also been addressed , such as the @xmath21 coupling constant  @xcite , the @xmath22 anomaly  @xcite , and the extended chiral symmetry  @xcite . among the more recent calculations which analyze the recent high - precision data",
    "are those of refs .",
    "the @xmath0-maid approach  @xcite is an isobar model which includes , in addition to the @xmath23-channel vector - meson exchange or its reggeized version , a set of well - established spin-1/2 , -3/2 , and -5/2 resonances .",
    "this model has been applied to the analyses of data for photoproduction as well as for electroproduction of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the bonn - gatchina - giessen group  @xcite has developed a model which has been employed in a combined partial wave analysis of the photoproduction data with @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 final states .",
    "this model considers fourteen nucleon resonances and seven delta resonances for achieving a reasonable overall agreement with the whole database considered in their analysis .",
    "resonances do not coupled to the @xmath16 and @xmath24 channels because of isospin conservation .",
    "] he , saghai , and li have analyzed the @xmath0-photoproduction reaction in a chiral constituent quark model  @xcite by considering all of the one- to four - star rated resonances listed in the review of particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .    in hadronic reactions ,",
    "a noticeable amount of data for @xmath12 has been accumulated  @xcite .",
    "here we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 invariant mass distributions and the analyzing power near threshold in addition to differential and total cross sections .",
    "the @xmath12 process is particularly relevant for studying the role of the @xmath16 final - state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "most of the existing calculations ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite and references therein ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) take into account the effects of the @xmath28 fsi in one way or another which is well - known to influence the energy dependence of the cross section near threshold .",
    "calculations which include the @xmath16 fsi to lowest order  @xcite reproduce the bulk of the energy dependence exhibited by the data . however , they are not sufficient to reproduce the @xmath26 invariant mass distribution measured by the cosy - tof  @xcite and cosy-11 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to explain the observed @xmath26 invariant mass distribution , the importance of the three - body nature of the final state ( in the @xmath29-wave ) has been emphasized  @xcite or an extra energy dependence in the basic production amplitude has been suggested  @xcite . yet , another possibility has been offered , which is based on the higher partial wave ( @xmath30-wave ) contribution  @xcite .",
    "we observe that what is actually required to reproduce the measured @xmath26 invariant mass distribution is an extra @xmath31 dependence , where @xmath32 denotes the relative momentum of the final @xmath26 subsystem .",
    "obviously , this can be achieved either by an @xmath29-wave or by a @xmath30-wave contribution .",
    "note that the @xmath28 @xmath30-wave ( @xmath33 ) can also yield a flat proton angular distribution as observed in the corresponding data .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , underpredicts the measured total cross near threshold to a large extent .",
    "one of the objectives of the present study is to resolve this discrepancy . in any case , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measurement of the spin - correlation functions should help settle the question of the @xmath29-wave versus @xmath30-wave contributions in a model - independent way .",
    "most data for more basic ( two - body ) @xmath34 reaction have been obtained in the 1960s through 1970s ; they are rather scarce and less accurate  @xcite than for the other two reactions mentioned above .",
    "recently , the crystal ball collaboration has measured the differential and total cross sections of this reaction near threshold  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this reaction has been studied mostly in conjunction with other reactions in a combined analysis  @xcite or in coupled - channels approaches  @xcite in order to constrain some of the model parameters .",
    "recently , zhong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have extended the chiral constituent quark model for meson photoproduction  @xcite to this reaction .",
    "also , @xmath34 has been studied within a heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "@xcite have investigated the role of @xmath34 on the @xmath16 scattering length within a coupled - channels analysis of this reaction and the elastic @xmath35 scattering .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the three reactions mentioned above in the following manner : the photoproduction reaction is calculated by considering the @xmath36- , @xmath37- and @xmath23-channel feynman diagrams plus a generalized contact term  @xcite , which ensures gauge invariance of the total amplitude , in addition to accounting for the final - state interaction effects .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . )",
    "the @xmath34 reaction is calculated in the tree - level approximation including the @xmath36- , @xmath37- , and @xmath23-channels . to the extent that this reaction is dominated by the excitation of the @xmath5 resonance at least for energies close to the threshold",
    ", this should be a reasonable approximation if we confine ourselves to energies not too far from the threshold .",
    "the @xmath38 process is calculated in the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) , where both the @xmath28 fsi and the initial - state interaction ( isi ) are taken into account explicitly  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 fsi is known to be responsible for the dominant energy dependence observed in the total cross section ( apart from the dependence due to the phase space ) arising from the very strong interaction in the @xmath29-wave states at very low energies  @xcite . as for the basic meson - production amplitude , our model includes the nucleonic , mesonic , and nucleon resonance currents which are derived from the relevant effective lagrangians .",
    "ultimately , our goal is to perform a more complete model calculation where the relevant fsis are taken into account explicitly .",
    "however , before being able to undertake a complex calculation that couples many channels , we need to learn some of the basic features of meson production ( in particular , those of @xmath0-meson production ) within a simplified model where these basic features may be revealed and analyzed in a much easier manner . in this",
    "regard , one of the major purposes of the present investigation is to show that consideration of the hadronic reactions @xmath39 , in conjunction with more basic two - body reactions , would greatly help in the study of nucleon resonances , especially , in imposing much stricter constraints on the extracted resonance - nucleon - meson ( @xmath40 ) coupling strength involving a meson @xmath41 other than the pion . in fact , currently , our knowledge of the branching ratios of the majority of the known resonances is very limited  @xcite .",

    "the phenomenological form factors used in this model are also given in the appendix .",
    "the free parameters of our model  the resonance parameters , the @xmath21 coupling constant , and the cutoff parameter @xmath58 at the electromagnetic vector - meson exchange vertex  are fixed such as to reproduce the available data in a global fitting procedure of the three reaction processes listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the results of our model calculation .",
    "the basic strategy of our approach is in principle the same as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , we start with the nucleon plus meson - exchange currents and add resonance contributions one by one as needed in the fitting procedure until achieving a reasonable description of the available experimental data for the reactions listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "apart from the dominant @xmath5 resonance , we allow for other well - established resonances of spin-@xmath59 , -@xmath60 , and -@xmath61 in this model .",
    "we find that , in addition to spin-@xmath59 resonances , one needs at least spin-3/2 resonances  in particular , @xmath62 resonances  in order to obtain a reasonable description of the data in the present approach .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , for each resonance we take into account only the branching ratios @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 corresponding to the respective hadronic decay channels @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",

    "the same is true for the branching ratio @xmath71 , associated with the radiative decay channel , which is related to the corresponding @xmath72 coupling constants .",
    "then , in view of the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : brsum ] ) , the branching ratio @xmath65 is not a free parameter , either . here , we emphasize that , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite  where some assumptions were made concerning the values of the branching ratios @xmath63  no such assumptions are enforced in the present work since the simultaneous consideration of the reaction processes listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) allows us , in principle , to extract the @xmath69 and @xmath70 coupling constants separately .",
    "the coupling constants of the @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) interaction lagrangians are required in the calculation of the @xmath75 reaction . therefore , in principle , one should also take into account the hadronic branching ratios involving vector mesons ( such as the @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",

    "as one can see , some parameter values are considerably outside the range quoted in pdg .",
    "however , we note that , although various parameters are highly correlated to each other , the currently available data used in the present study are not sufficient to uniquely constrain the model parameters . as a result",

    "[ fig : photo4c](b ) . as",
    "one can see , the flat angular distribution near the threshold is dominated by the @xmath85 resonance .",
    "when the photon incident energy ( in the laboratory frame ) @xmath86 is larger than about @xmath87  gev , both the @xmath62 resonance and the mesonic currents become relevant for reproducing the shape of the measured differential cross sections . as energy increases ,",
    "the shape becomes more and more forward - peaked , which is a well - known feature of the @xmath23-channel mesonic current contribution . in the energy region of @xmath88@xmath89  gev ,",
    "some details of the measured angular distribution are still not well explained , which indicates that our model should be improved by a more refined and quantitative calculation .",
    "we leave such an investigation to a future work .",
    "the nucleonic current contribution is negligible because of very small coupling constant @xmath90 resulting from the fit , which is preferred by the small angular distribution measured at backward angles and higher energies .",
    "the nucleonic current contributes mostly at backward angles and at high energies through the @xmath37-channel diagram ( cf.fig .",

    "we mention that the total cross section data for photoproduction were _ not _ included in the global fitting process",
    ". as one can see , the large peak that rises sharply from threshold is due to the dominating @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances .",
    "although both the @xmath62 resonance and mesonic currents are small , their contribution beyond @xmath91 gev can not be ignored because of the interference with the large @xmath85 current contribution . around @xmath92 gev ,",
    "all the resonance and mesonic currents become comparable to each other , but at higher energies , the mesonic current yields the largest contribution and the @xmath85 resonance contribution becomes negligible as expected from their relative low mass .",
    "the structure shown by the data at @xmath93 gev seems to suggest possible contributions from other higher mass resonances .",
    "analyses of this structure and other details are left to a future work .",

    "this is a feature common to all the parameter sets and not just to the particular parameter set of table  [ tbl : photo4c ] . to understand the origin of this discrepancy",
    ", we consider the partial - wave contribution to the spin asymmetries .",
    "we expect that only a few partial waves contribute mostly to this reaction near the threshold .",

    "then , it is easy to understand that it is more difficult to describe the latter observable because the beam asymmetry does not exhibit interference effects while the target asymmetry does .",
    "equation  ( [ spin - asym ] ) also shows that the @xmath29-wave final state does not contribute to the beam asymmetry .",
    "another parameter set resulting from the global fit , employing the same set of nucleon resonances as in table  [ tbl : photo4c ] , is shown in table  [ tbl : photo4d ] .",
    "this set was obtained by using different starting values for the search in parameter space during the fit procedure . as a result , many parameter values of this set are quite different from those of table  [ tbl : photo4c ] not only in magnitude but also in relative signs for some coupling constants which provides an indication of the general reliability of such global fits .",

    "<S> the @xmath0-meson production in photon- and hadron - induced reactions , namely , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , are investigated in a combined analysis in order to learn about the relevant production mechanisms and the possible role of nucleon resonances in these reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the nucleonic , mesonic , and nucleon resonance currents constructed within an effective lagrangian approach and compare the results with the available data for cross sections and spin asymmetries for these reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the reaction @xmath1 can be described well with the inclusion of the well - established @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 resonances , in addition to the mesonic current . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of other well - established resonances in the same mass region , including the spin-5/2 resonances , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , does not further improve the results qualitatively . for the reaction @xmath2 , the @xmath11 resonance is found to be important for reproducing the structure observed in the differential cross section data . </S>",
