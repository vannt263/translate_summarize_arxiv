    "the possibility of time travel has been one of the theoretical physicists favorite puzzles . of particular interest",
    "is time traveling to the past , since it raises many causality paradoxes .",
    "although our experience tells us such voyages are unlikely to be achievable , there is no rigorous proof of their impossibility . in an attempt to address this problem , hawking put forward a chronology protection conjecture @xcite , extending earlier results by tipler @xcite .",
    "his argument was based on the behavior of quantum field theory in the presence of closed null curves , since in a spacetime with a cauchy surface any future causality problems must be preceded by the formation of one such curve .",
    "hawking argued that the one - loop energy - momentum tensor becomes very large near a closed null curve , therefore causing a significant backreaction in the geometry .",
    "the outcome would be a naked singularity or a gravitational evolution that prevents formation of the closed null curve itself .",
    "either way , the mechanism that protects chronology is an ultraviolet effect .",
    "since the ultraviolet behavior of string theory is different from that of quantum field theories , it is questionable that the above mechanism will protect chronology .",
    "theories with extended objects provide privileged probes of spacetimes with closed causal curves since the extended objects can wrap around them . as mentioned above , closed null curves are particularly important because causality problems first arise when such curves are created . in the framework of string theory ,",
    "there are winding string states that can become light just before they wrap a closed null curve , when their proper length is of the string scale .",
    "a phase transition can then occur , analogous to the hagedorn phase transition where winding string states become massless for a compactification circle with radius of the string scale @xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible that light winding states play a role in protecting chronology . in this work",
    "we establish this analogy in detail by studying a toy model , where we are able to show that such phase transition does in fact occur and it is associated to the condensation of string fields in the causally problematic region .",
    "we expect this mechanism to hold in general , which leads us to the following conjecture : _ closed null curves do not form in string theory because light winding states condense , causing a phase transition whose end - point target space geometry is chronological_. this mechanism for protecting chronology is truly stringy and is an infrared effect , in sharp contrast with hawking s proposal .",
    "the toy model we shall consider is an orbifold of three - dimensional minkowski space introduced in @xcite , called the o - plane orbifold . the orbifold quotient space is a good laboratory to study the issue of chronology protection because it is free of singularities and it develops closed causal curves .",
    "there is , however , a truncation of spacetime that is free of closed causal curves .",
    "it is the main point of this work to show that some winding string states , which condense in the pathological region of spacetime , give a possible mechanism for the protection of chronology . for other works of strings on orbifolds with closed causal curves and on closed string backgrounds with bad chronology see [ 647 ] .",
    "since the orbifold closed causal curves are topological , it is questionable whether the conjectured mechanism is generic , in the sense that it might not work for non - topological closed causal curves dictated by the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "however , when fermions obey anti - periodic boundary conditions around the closed curves , we believe the mechanism is general because the appearance of unstable winding states relies only on the existence of closed curves with very small proper length .",
    "we start our discussion in section two by giving a detailed review of the o - plane orbifold . in particular , we analyze its causal structure , wave functions and quantum field theory divergences . we find infrared divergences associated to the condensation of some particle states and show that the theory is ultraviolet divergent because of the presence of the non - causal region . in section three",
    "we consider strings in the o - plane orbifold .",
    "again we analyze the string wave functions and compute the one - loop partition function , which when appropriately interpreted has only infrared divergences .",
    "these divergences are associated to the presence of unstable string states , whose condensation is conjectured to protect chronology in section four .",
    "we give some concluding remarks in section five .",
    "appendix a contains some technical results regarding wave functions and corresponding hilbert space measure . in appendix",
    "b we give an alternative derivation of the particle and string partition functions using the path integral formalism .",
    "in this section we shall review some basic facts about the o - plane orbifold introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is an orbifold of three - dimensional minkowski spacetime . to define it consider the light - cone coordinates @xmath0 , normalized such that the flat metric is given by @xmath1 .",
    "the orbifold group element @xmath2 is generated by the killing vector @xmath3 where @xmath4 are , respectively , the generators of a null boost and a null translation and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants .",
    "the orbits of this killing vector field can be found in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the orbifold identification can be explicitly written as @xmath7    since the generator of the o - plane orbifold involves the time direction one might wonder about the causal structure of quotient space , and in particular about the existence of closed causal curves .",
    "for this purpose it is convenient to introduce a new set of coordinates @xmath8 , in which the orbifold action becomes trivial .",
    "these are defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "now the orbifold identification becomes simply @xmath11 and the metric @xmath12 the surface @xmath13 divides spacetime in two regions , one with @xmath14 spacelike ( @xmath15 )  the good region  and the other with @xmath14 timelike ( @xmath16 )  the bad region .",
    "the region with @xmath16 is expected to be pathological .",
    "indeed , although there are closed timelike curves passing through every point in this space , these curves always enter the @xmath16 region as shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "moreover , in the covering space there are points which are light - like separated from their image .",
    "these points lie on the so - called _ polarization surfaces _ @xcite .",
    "null curves joining a point and its image become closed null curves in quotient space and are dangerous in quantum field theory because they are responsible for extra divergences , as we shall review in subsection 2.3 .      to understand dynamics in the o - plane orbifold , we start by analyzing the motion of point particles",
    ". clearly , particle trajectories are straight lines in covering space . however , we are interested in studying the problem from the view point of an observer using @xmath17-coordinates , which reduces to considering the following lagrangian @xmath18 dots are derivatives with respect to an affine parameter .",
    "we now introduce the canonical conjugate momenta @xmath19 , of which the first and third components are conserved .",
    "this is because the quotient space preserves only two of the six isometries of three - dimensional minkowski space , namely those generated by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the problem then simplifies to the motion of the particle along direction @xmath22 , with an effective hamiltonian given by = p^2+v(y )  ,  v(y)-2ep_+^2y-2p_+p_-  .",
    "[ hv ] the motion is thus determined by a linear potential . the constant force associated to this potential is clearly an inertial force , since the @xmath17-coordinates describe an accelerating frame .    now comes an important point .",
    "the hamiltonian , which is a constant of motion , is the momentum squared of the particle = p_p^= - m^2  , [ defmass ] and is therefore fixed by the particle s mass .",
    "the classical turning point @xmath23 for a particle of light - cone energy @xmath24 and kaua - klein momentum @xmath25 is then found by setting @xmath26 in the previous equation m^2 = 2 p_+ p_- + 2ey_0p_+^2  .",
    "[ particlemassshell ]    consider first a particle of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear from figure [ figure2 ] that such a particle will never enter the bad region @xmath16 .",
    "since the slope of the potential gets steeper as @xmath24 increases , the higher the light - cone energy of the particle , the closer it gets to @xmath13 . in the low energy limit @xmath29 ,",
    "the particle is pushed away to @xmath30 . on the other hand",
    ", particles of @xmath31 and @xmath28 always cross into the bad region and , for low energies , reach very far out into this region as can be seen from figure [ figure2 ] .    for particles with @xmath32 the potential",
    "is displaced along @xmath22 , so it no longer goes through @xmath13 .",
    "however , the above qualitative behavior is the same : particles with @xmath33 are repelled away from the bad region and for low energies are pushed away to @xmath30 ; particles with @xmath34 are also repelled but for low energies reach far out into the bad region .      to quantize the particle , we follow the usual prescription of replacing @xmath35 in the mass - shell condition ( [ defmass ] ) .",
    "the single particle wave functions @xmath36 obey the klein - gordon equation @xmath37 to find the solutions to this differential equation we first consider a complete basis of functions in the orbifold .",
    "the details are presented in the appendix a.1 ; here we state the necessary results .",
    "in addition to the orbifold periodicity @xmath38 , we consider a large box defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the wave functions _",
    "p_+,y_0,m ( ) = ( z)e^i(p_+y^+ + y^- )  , [ wavefunctions ] form a complete normalized basis and are eigenfunctions of the laplacian in the o - plane orbifold .",
    "the kaua - klein momentum is quantized as @xmath41 and the other quantum numbers are the light - cone energy @xmath24 and the classical turning point @xmath23 .",
    "the function @xmath42 is an airy function with argument given by @xmath43 and k = k ( p_+)= 2ep_+^2  ,   ( y_0,p_+ ) = ^1/2  .",
    "[ k ] a @xmath22-plot of a wave function is given in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "to sum over states in the hilbert space the appropriate integration measure is given by @xmath44    on - shell wave functions are eigenfunctions of the laplacian with eigenvalue @xmath45 and therefore their quantum numbers satisfy the mass - shell condition ( [ particlemassshell ] ) . to define the evolution of a given field configuration , we shall consider an initial value problem defined on a surface of constant @xmath46 .",
    "the normal @xmath47 to this surface has norm given by @xmath48 .",
    "thus , in the good region @xmath15 this surface is space - like and the initial value problem is standard .",

    "we shall interpret this `` initial '' data as a boundary condition .",
    "this is satisfactory to understand the evolution of perturbations in the good region . in appendix",
    "a.2 we construct a basis of functions on a surface of constant @xmath46 .",
    "the light - cone evolution of each mode will be determined by its light - cone energy fixed by the on - shell relation . in the appendix",
    "we show that , in order to be normalizable on a surface of constant @xmath46 , the modes must have @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath50 , we have unstable modes with @xmath24 purely imaginary and @xmath23 complex .",
    "to understand the subtleties of matter propagation in the o - plane orbifold , we consider the cases of massive particles ( @xmath27 ) and tachyons @xmath51 separately , both for @xmath52 .",
    "massless particles can be included in the case of massive particles by introducing an infrared regulator .    for massive particles ,",
    "the behavior of the wave function can be easily understood from the corresponding classical effective potential in ( [ hv ] ) .",
    "the turning point @xmath23 is now the point where the wave function turns from oscillatory to evanescent ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) . for on - shell particles , the mass formula ( [ particlemassshell ] ) , with @xmath28 ,",

    "this dispersion relation is plotted in figure [ figure4 ] . as expected from the classical behavior , in the low energy limit we have @xmath53 and",
    "the wave function vanishes everywhere . in appendix",
    "a.2 we show that the set of on - shell wave functions with @xmath54 is a complete basis of normalizable functions on a surface of @xmath46 constant .",
    "thus , from figure [ figure4 ] , we see that to include modes with @xmath55 we must allow for imaginary @xmath24 .",
    "then we are effectively dealing with the classical potential @xmath56 with @xmath57 and the wave functions oscillate in the bad region . since the light - cone energy is imaginary , these modes can grow in time .",
    "a generic field configuration will then grow in light - cone time @xmath46 , mainly in the bad region .",
    "we conclude that massive particles have unstable modes in this spacetime .",
    "if the bad region were to be excised , we would expect to be left only with well - behaved modes .",
    "next consider a tachyon , also with @xmath52 .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure5 ] , for @xmath24 real the turning point lies at @xmath55 and the wave function oscillates according to the classical trajectory in figure [ figure2 ] . to allow for states with @xmath58 one must consider imaginary @xmath24 .",
    "these unstable modes oscillate in space for @xmath59 and therefore reach far out into the good region .",
    "contrary to massive particles , in the low energy limit the tachyon wave function is a plane wave throughout space , which is the usual result for tachyons in minkowski space .",
    "particles with non - vanishing kaua - klein momentum have a similar qualitative behavior .",
    "in particular , the condition for having on - shell stable states with real @xmath23 can be obtained from the mass formula ( [ particlemassshell ] ) 2ey_0 ( m^2 + ) > 0  , [ unstpart ] where @xmath60 is the proper radius squared of the orbifold compact direction , computed at the turning point @xmath23 .",
    "when this condition is not satisfied , @xmath24 becomes complex and the associated wave functions are not normalizable on a surface of constant @xmath46 .",
    "however , in appendix a.2 , we show that there are other unstable on  shell states , with @xmath24 purely imaginary and @xmath23 complex , which are normalizable .      to compare with the string theory results presented later on in this paper , we study the usual quantum field theory pathologies in the o - plane orbifold due to the presence of closed causal curves .",
    "these are the ultraviolet problems that led hawking to conjecture that a strong gravitational backreaction would protect chronology .",
    "consider first the existence of polarization surfaces , arising from light - like separated images . since the covering space is minkowski space",
    ", it is simple to compute the relativistic interval between image points @xmath61 in particular , points located at @xmath62 are null separated from their @xmath63-th image .",
    "it is important to note that the corresponding closed null curve intersects the @xmath13 surface , so it is possible that cutting off the @xmath16 region cures any pathology arising from the polarization surfaces , as proposed in @xcite .    for a scalar field @xmath64 of mass @xmath65",
    "the two - point function can be written in euclidean schwinger parameterization as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and the trajectory winding number @xmath68 runs from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath71 lies on the @xmath63-th polarization surface , the two - point function has extra divergences as @xmath72 , coming from the @xmath73 terms in the sum .",
    "these are ultraviolet divergences that are not renormalizable @xcite .",
    "likewise , the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor diverges at the polarization surfaces .",
    "again , these problems could be cured if one excises the bad region .",

    "the alternative would be to choose a state dependent wick rotation depending on the sign of @xmath80 .",
    "however , in string theory the requirement of modular invariance forces us to treat all modes equally @xcite .",
    "the chosen wick rotation is physically reasonable because massive particle states that propagate in the good region , i.e. states with @xmath58 , give a finite contribution to the partition function . on the other hand , states with @xmath55",

    "this is related to the existence of on - shell unstable states .",
    "these states oscillate in both good and bad regions and therefore their condensation would change the whole of spacetime .    to analyze the ultraviolet behavior of the partition function",
    "it is useful to consider the expression obtained from the path integral formalism .",
    "we report on this computation in appendix b and on its derivation starting from the above canonical result in appendix a.1 . here",
    "we simply give the final result @xmath82 where @xmath22 is now the particle s average position along this direction and @xmath68 is the winding number of closed trajectories .",

    "expects that the closed string tachyon condensation will change the spacetime structure . for the o - plane orbifold",

    "it is therefore natural to conjecture that this phase transition protects chronology .    for simplicity ,",

    "the singularity developed by the partition function for @xmath184 confirms these results .",
    "the o - plane orbifold phase transition shares some properties with the hagedorn phase transition .",
    "consider the bosonic string compactified on circle of radius @xmath5 .",

    "the radius @xmath5 is a moduli .",
    "as the radius decreases to @xmath188 the first winding state @xmath159 condenses and triggers the phase transition . on the other hand , for the o - plane orbifold",
    "the compactification radius varies with the coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "since the @xmath159 winding state is the one that penetrates the furthest into the good region , one expects that the condensation of this field will cause significant changes on the spacetime structure for @xmath189 .",

    "it is straightforward to extend the previous results to the superstring , where one needs to specify the orbifold spin structure . for both spin structures ,",
    "we need to recall that , in the ns - ns sector , the normal ordering for the virasoro zero - modes gives the on - shell relation @xmath190 .",

    "is based on an ultraviolet effect .",
    "he advocates that strong curvature effects due to a large one loop energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields will create a singularity or will prevent spacetime to curve such that non - causal curves do not form .",
    "in contrast , the string theory mechanism for chronology protection is an infrared effect , as it is usually the case for phase transitions .",

    "the authors of the latter work argued that , after condensation of the winding string field , the worldsheet theory will flow to an infrared trivial fixed point with no target space geometric interpretation .",
