    "it is well known that our galaxy is surrounded by a family of satellite systems .",
    "these include the several known dwarf spheroidal galaxies as well as the large and small magellanic clouds and numerous globular clusters @xcite . the gravitational tidal influence of our galaxy is currently causing the sagittarius galaxy and globular cluster palomar 51 to be torn apart @xcite .",
    "tidally induced mass loss may also be important for explaining the amount and distribution of intracluster light @xcite .",
    "an improved understanding of the way in which tidal mass loss occurs is therefore of great importance for understanding the evolution of galaxies and clusters .",
    "furthermore it is known that , although n - body simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) successfully reproduce the overall structure of the universe , they show potential discrepancies with observations at galactic scales .",
    "the discrepancy between the number of low mass sub - haloes predicted by cdm and the observed number of satellite galaxies is on the order of a factor 510 more @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called satellite catastrophe for hierarchical galaxy models .",
    "tidal interactions between galaxies may help to resolve this apparent discrepancy @xcite .",
    "sub - haloes can fail to be `` lit - up '' by a galaxy because their star formation has been inhibited by early and significant mass loss .",
    "there is also the possibility , in extreme cases , for the satellite to be totally destroyed due to the gravitational influence of a larger dark matter halo or massive galaxy .",
    "finally , observations show that merging is a key driver in the evolution of galaxy morphologies .",
    "n - body simulations of the assembly of galaxies in a hierarchical universe show that , as dark matter halos coalesce , the embedded galaxies merge on a time - scale that is consistent with dynamical friction estimates based on their total mass @xcite .",
    "accurate treatment of tidal interactions is important if we wish to explore this phenomena since dynamical frictional timescales depend upon the remaining bound mass of each satellite .",
    "recently , analytic models of satellite orbits and merging have been developed and employed to study the properties of the sub - halo populations of cdm haloes @xcite , and to make quantitative predictions for the distributions of such sub - haloes .",
    "these models typically employ what we will refer to as the `` classic '' treatment of tidal mass loss  namely computing a radius in the satellite at which internal and tidal forces balance and removing all mass beyond that radius  together with simple estimates of the time over which this mass is lost .",
    "this `` classic '' method of determining tidal mass loss is clearly oversimplified  as particles orbit within the satellite halo they may be stripped away by tidal forces as they approach apocentre , even though they spend most of their time at smaller radii . in this work , therefore , we re - examine the process of tidal mass loss and present a more realistic calculation based upon the orbits of individual particles within a satellite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : alyt ] briefly reviews the `` classic '' calculation of tidal radius , before describing our improved model and presenting some basic results from it .",
    "section  [ sec : nbody ] compares the results of our model with n - body simulations . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "we begin by reviewing the classic calculation of tidal mass loss in  [ sec : classcalc ] , before presenting our improved calculation in  [ sec : phspmod ] .      in order to determine the tidal radius , we consider a small mass orbiting at radius @xmath0 from the centre of a satellite and",
    "let the mass of satellite enclosed inside this orbit be @xmath1 .",
    "the satellite itself orbits within a host potential at a radius @xmath2 .",
    "there are two forces on this mass : the gravitational pull towards the centre of the satellite and the gravitational tidal force from the host potential .",
    "the gravitational acceleration on the mass towards the satellite centre is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are a characteristic mass and radius respectively in the satellite .",
    "the gravitational tidal acceleration on the mass due to the host potential can be expressed as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the mass of the host system within radius @xmath2 .",
    "note that we have approximated the tidal field as being linear across the satellite  the usual approximation made in considering tidal fields .",
    "the tidal radius is reached when the gravitational acceleration on the mass towards the satellite centre equals the tidal acceleration on the mass from the host potential , i.e. where @xmath12 or @xmath13    the above equation can be re - expressed in terms of the tidal field @xmath14 , defined to be the gradient of the tidal acceleration due to the host potential @xmath15 where @xmath16 giving @xmath17 the default values we choose are typical of a massive satellite in a milky way - like system ( @xmath18 and a distance between the centre of mass of the satellite and that of the host galaxy of @xmath19kpc , resulting in @xmath20we will explore variations of a factor of 10 about this default @xmath14 ) .",
    "the tidal radius can be found by solving the above for @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : classrad ] shows the tidal radius as a function of @xmath14 for a satellite described by an nfw density profile @xcite with a concentration parameter ( the ratio of the virial radius to the characteristic scale radius ) of @xmath22 .",
    "( for the characteristic radius and mass we have chosen @xmath7 to be the scale radius of the nfw profile and have set @xmath6 to equal @xmath23the virial mass of the halo . )      as mentioned in the introduction , the classic model of tidal mass loss is clearly highly simplified .",
    "it assumes a sharp cut - off in the satellite density profile at the tidal radius , and is insensitive to the phase space distribution of the satellite ( i.e. satellites in which orbits are purely tangential would have the same tidal radius as those with purely radial orbits , providing that the overall density profile was the same ) .",
    "furthermore the classic model does not take into account the orbit of stars , we know that prograde orbits are more easily stripped than radial orbits ; while radial orbits are more easily stripped than retrograde orbits @xcite .    in order to understand the effects of a tidal field on the particles ( i.e. particles of dark matter or stars ) within the satellite with mass @xmath24 , we assume a satellite which experiences a constant tidal force ( e.g. on a circular orbit within a spherical host potential with negligible dynamical friction ) . although the assumption of a constant tidal force is unrealistic ( few satellites will be on orbits that are close to circular and , for our default satellite , the dynamical friction timescale is of order 10gyr , resulting in significant change in orbital radius on a timescale comparable to the mass loss timescale from the satellite ) , we choose to explore this idealized case here and will explore more realistic examples in future work .",
    "particle orbits within the satellite however , have arbitrary ellipticity .",
    "figure  [ fig : diag ] shows the geometry of the particle orbit considered below .",
    "the energy per unit mass of a particle is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational potential of the satellite and @xmath27 is the velocity of the particle .",
    "we assume an nfw potential for the satellite , resulting in a potential : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean density of the halo .    we consider a rotating frame of reference which rotates at the same rate as the orbitting satellite .",
    "as the particle moves around its orbit it experiences a torque ( relative to the centre of mass of the satellite ) due to tidal ( from the host potential ) and coriolis forces .",
    "the angular momentum of the particle therefore varies around the orbit .",
    "the particle must always remain bound to the combined satellite plus host potential ( since those potentials are not time - varying the energy of the particle is conserved along its orbit ) .",
    "however , we can ask the question : if the host potential were instantaneously removed , would the particle be bound to the satellite or not ? to answer this question we simply need to know the angular momentum of the particle relative to the satellite centre , as this immediately gives the kinetic energy of the particle relative to the satellite centre .",
    "we expect this criterion to be a reasonable discriminator between particles which are essentially confined to the satellite and those which can move more freely throughout the host potential ( i.e. those in tidal tails ) .",
    "experiments with n - body simulations ( see  [ sec : nbody ] ) confirm this expectation .",
    "the calculation of the perturbation to the particle s angular momentum is given in appendix  [ app : am ] , where we compute the maximum value of the particle s energy ( in a frame instantaneously moving with the satellite ) , @xmath30 .",
    "the total mass loss suffered from the satellite galaxy is found by integrating over phase space @xmath31 for this work we assume that the phase space density , @xmath32 , is a separable function , so it can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the density profile of the satellite and @xmath35 if @xmath36 and @xmath37 if @xmath38 . here",
    ", @xmath39 is the velocity distribution function of the particles in the satellite for which we assume an ( anisotropic in general ) gaussian distribution and which is normalised such that @xmath40 .",
    "the radial density profile can be found in a similar way as shown in eqn .",
    "[ eq : mloss ] , by simply not performing the integral over radius .",
    "we find the velocity dispersion of the satellite by solving the jeans equation : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "for the radial anisotropy ( defined as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the tangential velocity dispersion ) we use a fixed value ( i.e. independent of radius ) , ranging from 0 ( isotropic motion ) to @xmath45 ( radial motion ) .",
    "integration is begun at three times the virial radius , which is sufficiently large to give an accurate determination of the velocity dispersion throughout the satellite .",
    "we wish to estimate the time over which the mass will be lost from the satellite .",
    "we expect that any unbound particle will be lost in a time of order the dynamical time . defining the dynamical time as @xmath46 an approximate mass loss rate from the satellite is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density distribution of mass lost through tidal stripping ( i.e. the original density profile minus that after tidal mass loss ) .",
    "the characteristic timescale for mass loss is then @xmath49 where we have introduced a parameter @xmath50 to allow this timescale to be adjusted to match numerical results .",
    "we expect @xmath51 .",
    "using the model described above , we can compute the mass lost by the satellite due to tidal forces , and the resulting density profile of the remaining bound material . this new density profile will give rise to a new potential @xmath52 , weaker than that of the original satellite .",
    "as such , if we apply our same calculation of mass loss to the remaining bound particles , using this new potential , we expect that further mass loss will occur .",
    "this process can , in principle , be repeated _",
    "ad infinitum_. assuming that the potential changes on a timescale of approximately @xmath53 we can use our model to compute mass loss as a function of time .",
    "essentially , we are breaking up the continuous process of mass loss into discrete intervals ( each of order the dynamical time ) .",
    "we compute the total mass loss over each interval , before updating the satellite density profile and potential prior to computing mass loss for the next interval",
    ". we will refer to these intervals as `` mass loss iterations '' .      our model , while a vast improvement over the `` classic '' calculation of tidal mass loss , has its own limitations :    1 .   in our model",
    "there is the implicit assumption that the mass loss takes place instantaneously after a time @xmath54 . since",
    "mass loss is a continuous process our choice to update the satellite s potential only after a time @xmath53 is an approximation .",
    "our model could be modified to use smaller steps in time , for example stepping forward by 10% of the mass loss timescale , while removing only 10% of the mass predicted to have been lost .",
    "this would result in more frequent updates in the density and potential thereby improving this approximation .",
    "2 .   in computing the energy gained by each particle",
    ", we evaluate the tidal perturbation by integrating around the orbit which the particle would follow in the absence of any tidal field . in reality",
    ", the orbit will be stretched by the tidal field , which will in turn alter the energy gain .",
    "these higher order contributions to the energy gain are ignored in this work , although in principle they could be comparable to the first order energy gain .",
    "3 .   after each mass loss iteration , we hold the density profile of the remaining particles fixed and compute a new velocity dispersion profile using eqn .",
    "( [ eq : jeans ] ) .",
    "this effectively changes the energies and angular momenta of the remaining bound particles .",
    "a correct calculation of the phase space distribution of the particles after each episode of mass loss is an important missing ingredient of our model .",
    "we defer detailed study of this issue to a future paper ( see  [ sec : discuss ] for further discussion of this point ) .      in this section",
    "will present the basic results of the model discused in ",
    "[ sec : phspmod ] .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will consider an nfw satellite with concentration parameter @xmath55 , isotropic orbits ( @xmath56 ) in an @xmath20 tidal field .",

    "as expected , stronger tidal fields result in greater mass loss from the satellite . for the strongest tidal field shown , significant mass loss occurs even at the scale radius ( @xmath60 ) of the satellite .",

    "note that our model predicts that the satellite continues to lose mass in each successive mass loss iteration  there is no evidence that the mass is converging to some fixed value .",

    "this does not necessarily reflect the scalings expected for cosmological halos for which the concentration and mass are correlated @xcite .      here",
    "we will compare our method with the results presented in @xcite .",
    "in particular , they found that one can get the satelite s density profile after tidal stripping starting with an nfw profile and taking into account two kind of modifications : a lowering of the central density @xmath68 and the introduction of a tidal radius @xmath69 of the outer profile .",

    "the mass loss seen in these calculations is due entirely to the tidal field from the point mass .",
    "furthermore , with these parameters , the orbital radius of the centre of mass of the satellite varies by only 0.06% throughout the duration of our simulation .",
    "this corresponds to a 0.18% variation in @xmath14 .",
    "the mass and orbital radius combination of the circular orbit were chosen to produce a desired @xmath14 .",

    "the particle number was gradually increased until converged results were obtained .",
    "using @xmath77 particles , for example , we find that the remaining bound mass of the satellite differs from that in the @xmath76 particle simulation by less than 2% at all times .",

    ".    inspection of the n - body mass loss curve indicates that there are two distinct regimes of mass loss : an initial rapid regime in which mass declines almost exponentially with time ( illustrated by the thin dashed line ) followed by a slower regime in which mass declines as a power - law in time ( illustrated by the thin dotted line ) .",

    "( this overestimation is not seen for the @xmath71 calculation as the satellite loses its mass so rapidly that the second , slow mass loss regime is never seen . )    in addition to the total bound mass of the satellite , our model is able to predict the radial density profile of that mass . in fig .",

    "[ fig : nbodydensity ] ) the analytic model predicts the radial density profile seen in the n - body simulation reasonably accurately for the first iteration ( red line ) .",
    "after this , our model underpredicts the mass loss rate and , as such , overpredicts the resulting density profile . as the tidal field",
    "is increased the model fairs worse . for the strongest field",
    "considered we can see that the n - body satellite quickly develops a constant density core , the density of which decreases with time .",
    "our model does not reproduce this behaviour .",
    "this may reflect the fact that our model applies only first order perturbations to the particle orbits . as @xmath14",
    "is increased the orbits of particles which remain bound to the satellite become ever more perturbed due to the tidal force .",
    "a measure of this perturbation can be constructed by averaging @xmath84 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : deltae ] for the definition of @xmath85 ) over all particles which remain bound , which measures the fractional change in particle orbital energies .",
    "this quantity , after one iteration , is 0.08 , 0.21 and 0.30 for @xmath72 , @xmath86 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "thus , for the strongest field considered this factor is becoming quite large .",
    "furthermore , for an nfw potential , the gravitational potential varies only very slowly with radius at radii less than the scale radius .",
    "thus , a relatively small perturbation in the energies of particles at these radii can lead to a large perturbation in their apocentric distance . as a result",
    ", the second order correction to the work done by the tidal field can be large .",
    "we have presented a model of tidal mass loss from collisionless systems with arbitrary phase space distributions .",
    "our calculation has many advantages over the classic model of tidal mass loss ( in which the density profile is truncated beyond a tidal radius determined through force balance arguments ) .",
    "in particular , our calculation takes into account the orbital structure of the system , permitting the effects of anisotropic orbits on the degree of mass loss to be investigated .",
    "furthermore , we are able to estimate the density profile of the material remaining after mass loss has occurred .",
    "a key prediction from this model is that mass loss will be continuous even in a static field ",
    "the bound mass of the system shows no sign of converging to a fixed value .",
    "this behaviour is also seen in the n - body simulations which we have carried out . in particular ,",
    "the n - body simulations show evidence for two distinct regimes of mass loss : an initial rapid phase in which the mass declines exponentially with time followed by a slower phase during which the mass declines as a power - law in time .",
    "the rate of mass loss predicted by our model is comparable to that seen in the n - body simulations during the initial , rapid mass loss phase , although we find that the parameter @xmath50 ( which scales the rate of mass loss in our model ) must vary with the tidal field strength in order to match n - body results .",
    "we intend to explore and characterize this systematic variation of @xmath50 in a future paper .",
    "this continuous mass loss is a consequence of the fact that mass loss weakens the gravitational potential of the system thereby allowing particles to become unbound that could not have escaped from the original potential . at larger times , while the n - body simulations transition to a slower mass loss regime our model continues to show a rapid , exponential mass loss .",
    "the origin of the slow mass loss regime in the n - body simulations and the failure of our model to reproduce this is not understood at present , but is the focus of ongoing study .",
    "nevertheless , our model is able to describe the rate of mass loss quite well over almost 10 satellite dynamical times .",
    "the model presented in this work predicts small amounts of mass loss even when the tidal field is sufficiently weak that the classic model predicts zero mass loss ( due to the tidal radius lying beyond the outer radius of the system ) .",
    "as this mass loss occurs continuously it can eventually lead to a large reduction in the mass of the system ( e.g. in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : varftidal ] , with @xmath72 , the mass has been reduced to almost 60% of its original value after five mass loss iterations ) .",
    "this could have important consequences for the distribution and survival of low - mass satellite systems in dark matter haloes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbodydensity ] we see that , for the strongest tidal field , our model fails to predict the reduction in density in the centre of the satellite .",
    "this may explain the rather low value of @xmath50 we require to fit the mass loss rate in this case .",
    "if our model correctly predicted the mass loss from the centre of the halo it would naturally predict a lower @xmath87 . as noted in  [ sec : nbody ] this may be due to the fact that our estimate of the tidal torque exerted on each particle is correct only to first order  an improved calculation accounting for the distortion of particle orbits by tidal torques should result in greater mass loss , and is expected to be particularly important at small radii .",
    "we defer study of this issue to a future paper .",
    "we have demonstrated that our model is able to consider the effects of orbital anisotropy and profile shape on the degree of mass loss .",
    "a full study of the effects of anisotropy must await a full treatment of elliptical orbits , to be presented in a future paper .",
    "the major shortcoming of the present model is the lack of a reasonable method to compute the phase space density of particles after each mass loss iteration .",
    "currently , we simply assume that the density profile of the remaining bound material remains fixed ( i.e. the radial distribution of bound particles after mass loss is identical to the radial distribution of the same particles prior to mass loss ) .",
    "we then simply re - solve jeans equation to find a velocity dispersion which results in an equilibrium system built from these particles .    a possible improvement upon this may be to treat the potential of the satellite as varying only slowly with time .",
    "changes in particle orbits can then be considered in terms of adiabatic invariants and a new phase space density constructed which explicitly conserves these invariants for bound particles after mass loss has occurred .",
    "it should be noted , however , that mass loss is assumed to occur on a time comparable to the local dynamical time in the satellite ( an assumption confirmed by the n - body simulations carried out here ) .",
    "as such , the changes in the potential occur on a timescale comparable to the orbital times of particles , making the adiabatic approximation a poor one .",
    "the success of such an approach therefore remains to be determined .    in a future paper",
    ", we will develop this model further .",
    "along with the improvements mentioned above , we intend to examine more carefully the dependence of the energy gain through tidal torques on orbital eccentricity and the effects of using smaller time intervals for each mass loss iteration",
    ". we will also explore the application of our model to two - component ( i.e. dark matter + stellar ) systems and present fitting formula for mass loss as a function of tidal field strength and time .",
    "a further important consideration will be to apply our model to situations in which the tidal field varies with time .",
    "the model of tidal mass loss presented here represents part of an ongoing effort to improve the accuracy and predictive power of analytic models of satellite orbits and evolution .",
    "detailed modelling of this sort is required in order to understand the substructure of dark matter halos and the evolution of the galaxies within them .",
