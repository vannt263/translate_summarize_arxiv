    "<S> we present recent studies of charmonium multiquark states . </S>",
    "<S> we use different interacting models and numerical methods to study deeply bound four - quark states and meson - meson molecules . </S>",
    "<S> no deeply bound four - quark states are found in our analysis . a nice description of the x(3872 ) </S>",
    "<S> is obtained as a @xmath0 coupled channel state .    since </S>",
    "<S> 2003 several states have been discovered in the charmonium mass region . while in the conventional description of charmonium in terms of quark - antiquark pairs some states are still missing , the number of experimental states reported up to now is larger than empty spaces in the @xmath1 spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this overpopulation , together with other difficulties to explain observed states as simple quark - antiquark pairs , triggered discussions  @xcite on a possible exotic interpretation , four - quark states either as compact tetraquarks or slightly bound meson - meson molecules .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding of charmonium spectroscopy is challenging for experimentalists and theorists alike . </S>",
    "<S> charmonium has been used as the test bed to demonstrate the color fermi - breit structure of quark atoms obeying the same principles as ordinary atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its nonrelativistic character gave rise to an amazing agreement between experiment and simple quark potential model predictions as @xmath1 states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the opening of charmed meson thresholds was expected to modify the trend in the construction of quark - antiquark models . in the adiabatic approximation meson loops </S>",
    "<S> were absorbed into the static interquark potential . </S>",
    "<S> thus , close to the threshold production of charmed mesons models required of an improved interaction  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion above suggests that charmonium spectroscopy could be rather simple below the threshold production of charmed mesons but much more complex above it . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the coupling to the closest @xmath2 system , referred to as _ unquenching the naive quark model _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , could be an important spectroscopic ingredient . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , hidden - charm four - quark states could explain the overpopulation of quark - antiquark theoretical states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the new experimental discoveries are offering exciting new insights into the subtleties of the strong interaction .    in an attempt to disentangle the role played by multiquark configurations in the charmonium spectroscopy we obtained an exact solution of the four - body problem based on an infinite expansion of the four - quark wave function in terms of hyperspherical harmonics  @xcite . from our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we concluded that those four - quark states with two different asymptotic physical thresholds ( as it is the case of the @xmath3 system that may split either into a @xmath4 or @xmath5 two - meson states ) can hardly present a bound state since the interaction between any pair of quarks contributes to the energy of one of the two physical thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> close to a threshold we have used a different technique that we developed when studying baryon spectra with screened potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we solved the lippmann - schwinger equation looking for attractive channels that may contain a meson - meson molecule  @xcite . in order to account for all basis states we allow for the coupling to charmonium - light two - meson systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we consider the system of two mesons @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in a relative @xmath9state interacting through a potential @xmath10 that contains a tensor force , and therefore there is a coupling to the @xmath11 @xmath12wave . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the two @xmath13-meson system can couple to a charmonium - light two - meson state , for example @xmath14 is coupled to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we have consistently used the same interacting hamiltonian to study the two- and four - quark systems to guarantee that thresholds and possible bound states are eigenstates of the same hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are shown in table  [ t1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this study has been the first systematic analysis of four - quark hidden - charm states as compact states or meson - meson molecules . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a consistent study of all quantum numbers within the same model . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions robustly show that no deeply bound states can be expected for this system . </S>",
    "<S> only a few channels can be expected to present observable resonances or slightly bound states . among them </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the @xmath14 system must show a bound state slightly below the threshold for charmed mesons production with quantum numbers @xmath16 , that could correspond to the widely discussed @xmath17 . of the systems made of a particle and its corresponding antiparticle , @xmath18 and @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath20 is attractive . </S>",
    "<S> it would be the only candidate to accommodate a wide resonance for the @xmath18 system . for the @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> the attraction is stronger and structures may be observed close and above the charmed meson production threshold . </S>",
    "<S> also , we have shown that the @xmath21 @xmath19 channels are attractive due to the coupling to the @xmath15 and @xmath22 channels , respectively .    among these exotic theoretical states , charged states </S>",
    "<S> have an unique feature : by construction they can not be accommodated into the conventional @xmath1 spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> two different experimental findings show positive results on charge charmonium mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the first one was a @xmath23 peak at about 4430 mev / c@xmath24 observed by belle in the @xmath25 decays  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a second positive observation was reported by belle from the @xmath26 decay , with two resonances in @xmath27 at masses of about 4050 and 4250 mev / c@xmath24  @xcite . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> , babar has presented its own analysis  @xcite performing a detailed study of the acceptance and possible reflections concluding that no significant signal exists on the data . while the two experiments made different conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the data itself seem to be in a reasonable agreement except for the lower available statistics of the babar experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the states found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite could correspond to the @xmath19 @xmath28 we have predicted  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its confirmation would represent a unique tool in discriminating among different theoretical models .    </S>",
    "<S> due to heavy quark symmetry , replacing the charm quarks by bottom quarks decreases the kinetic energy without significantly changing the potential energy . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> four - quark bottomonium mesons must also exist and have larger binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental effort in this direction will confirm or rule out the theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> if the scenario presented here turns out to be correct , it will open a new interesting spectroscopic area . </S>"
