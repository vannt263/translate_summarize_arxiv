    "active asteroids are rare objects ( fewer than two dozen are currently known ) that exhibit comet - like dust emission , yet are located inside the orbit of jupiter and have asteroid - like orbits , typically defined as having a tisserand parameter of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "they consist of main - belt comets ( mbcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose activity is believed to be driven by volatile ice sublimation , and disrupted asteroids , whose mass loss is believed instead to be produced by an impact , rotational destabilization , or other physical mechanisms @xcite .",

    "water vapor outgassing has been detected for the main - belt dwarf planet ( 1 ) ceres @xcite , but visible dust emission has never been seen , and with a diameter of 950  km , ceres is also far larger than any of the known ( km - scale ) mbcs .",
    "the lack of direct detections of outgassing for most mbcs means that action of sublimation must be inferred indirectly . steady or increasing long - lived activity is suggestive , but is not indisputable , evidence of sublimation - driven activity , while impulsive dust emission and rapid fading is suggestive of an impact event ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but such modeling is susceptible to parameter degeneracies . complicating matters , some disruptive effects like spin - up disruption could , in principle , also produce long - lasting dust emission . the property that is considered the most definitive , if still indirect , evidence of sublimation - driven activity is recurrent activity near perihelion separated by intervening periods of inactivity @xcite .",
    "such behavior can not be easily explained by impacts , rotational disruption , or any other mechanism suspected of driving disrupted asteroid activity .",

    "[ figure : fig_images_orbplot ]      comet 324p / la sagra was discovered as p/2010 r2 on 2010 september 14 @xcite .",
    "it has a semimajor axis of @xmath7@xmath83.099  au , an eccentricity of @xmath9@xmath80.154 , an inclination of @xmath10@xmath821.396@xmath11 , and a tisserand parameter of @xmath12@xmath83.099 , dynamically placing it in the main asteroid belt .",
    "numerical modeling indicated that the observed emission could be simulated by anisotropic mass loss of @xmath13@xmath134  kg  s@xmath3 over @xmath147 months following perihelion , with an emission source near the object s south pole and an obliquity of @xmath190@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "precovery and follow - up data showed that 324p brightened by @xmath141  mag between 2010 august and december , further implying that dust production was ongoing over that period @xcite .",
    "december observations also revealed the appearance of both an antisolar dust tail and a dust trail aligned with the object s orbit plane .",
    "this morphology is strongly diagnostic of a prolonged emission event because it indicates the simultaneous presence of large , slow - moving particles emitted a long time in the past ( the dust trail ) , and small , fast - dissipating particles that must have been emitted very recently ( the antisolar tail ) @xcite .",
    "the evidence for long - lived dust emission strongly implies that the comet - like mass loss observed for 324p in 2010 was driven by the sublimation of ice , and was not caused by an impulsive mechanism such as an impact . in this paper , we present significant additional support for this conclusion in the form of observations of 324p s reactivation , making it now the fourth mbc confirmed to exhibit recurrent activity .",
    "we observed 324p between 2015 march and 2015 june with the 6.5  m baade magellan telescope at las campanas , and the 3.54  m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on mauna kea ( table  [ table : obslog ] ) .",
    "we employed the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( pixel scale of @xmath15  pixel@xmath3 ) for baade observations @xcite , and megacam ( @xmath16  pixel@xmath3 ) on cfht @xcite .",

    "photometry of @xmath19- and @xmath18-band april magellan data produced consistent results , providing assurance that our other @xmath19-band photometry is reliable .",
    "all cfht observations utilized a @xmath18-band filter .",

    "the net dust production rates measured in 2010 and 2015 differ by far more than these predicted sublimation rates would indicate , suggesting that other factors besides heliocentric distance are responsible for the observed difference in apparent activity strength ( cf .",
    "section  4 ) .",
    "we are interested in comparing 324p s active range , in terms of both orbit position and heliocentric distance , to those of other mbcs .",
    "we plot the confirmed active ranges ( where visible dust emission or photometric enhancement has been reported ) of all likely mbcs identified to date in figure  [ figure : fig_obs_all_activeasts ] . however",
    ", new objects are always discovered while already active , of course , meaning that each object must generally complete at least another full orbit in order for us to observationally constrain the starting point of activity , assuming that it becomes active again and that geometric constraints permit observations over the time period needed to observe the onset of activity .",
    "successful detections of activity are also dependent on the sensitivity of the telescopes and instruments being used to search for activity .",
    "therefore , the active regions marked in figure  [ figure : fig_obs_all_activeasts ] should be considered lower limits to the full ranges over which activity may be present .",
    "324p now has the largest observed active range of all likely mbcs in true anomaly , with both the earliest and latest observations of activity in terms of orbit position .",
    "it also now has the most distant confirmed inbound activation point ( @xmath4@xmath52.8@xmath75au ) of all of the mbcs .",
    "given the large diversity in mbcs in terms of possible activity mechanisms ( cf .",
    "* ) and dynamical properties , however , the significance of these distinctions is unclear at this time .",
    "to explain the difference in activity strengths measured for 324p from 2010 and 2015 observations , we note that an insulating layer of regolith could cause a lag in the response to temperature changes for an object with subsurface volatile material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since it takes time for a sun - driven thermal wave to propagate through such a layer to the subsurface .",
    "this means that 324p s observed 2010 activity ( when it was receding from the sun ) could reflect solar heating strength at a smaller effective @xmath4 , while its observed 2015 activity ( when it was approaching the sun ) could reflect the solar heating strength at a larger effective @xmath4 .",
    "mantling could also be responsible for weaker dust production during subsequent perihelion passages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite calculated that given an existing rubble mantle thicker than the diurnal thermal skin depth , it would take @xmath81100  years of continuous sublimation to increase the mantle thickness enough to reduce the sublimation rate of water ice by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , an order of magnitude decrease in the sublimation rate could also occur in the transition from freshly exposed ice to ice covered by a rubble mantle with a thickness equal to the diurnal thermal skin depth , a process estimated to require up to @xmath11  year of ongoing sublimation @xcite .",
    "if 324p s 2010 activity was due to the sublimation of freshly exposed ice , a dramatic decrease in activity strength during the next orbit could be explained by new mantle growth .",
    "observations of 324p during its current active period that overlap with the true anomaly range of the observations in 2010 are needed to shed light on the possible causes of the lower net dust production rate measured in 2015 relative to 2010 .",
    "numerical dust modeling is also needed to determine the object s true dust production rate at various times ( e.g. , by taking dust dissipation into account ) , providing better indications of the sublimation strength at those times .",
    "numerical dust modeling will also be needed to ascertain 324p s true active range , since the residual dust trail observed in late 2011 likely largely consisted of long - lived large particles , and therefore does not necessarily indicate that ongoing dust production was actually present at the time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this work is based on data gathered with the 6.5 meter magellan telescopes at las campanas observatory , as well as with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / dapnia , at cfht , which is operated by the national research council of canada , the institute national des sciences de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique of france , and the university of hawaii .",
