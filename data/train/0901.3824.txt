    "they are typical examples of self - similar structures , and physical properties peculiar to them have been explored . in order to observe effects of quasiperiodicity , optical experiments using dielectric multilayers of @xmath3 and @xmath4 films were performed for the fibonacci multilayer @xcite . in these experiments , scaling behaviors of the transmission coefficients were observed , which had been predicted by the renormalization - group theory @xcite",
    ". for fractal structures , optical wave propagation on cantor multilayers has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "self - similar structures of the transmission ( or reflection ) coefficients were obtained numerically @xcite . moreover ,",
    "resonant states of light were studied @xcite , which was motivated by an experiment using a three - dimensional fractal cavity called the menger sponge @xcite .    in this paper , we reexamine the optical wave propagation through cantor sequences on the basis of the renormalization - group theory .",
    "in addition to the self - similar structures mentioned above , we find interesting chaotic behaviors of the transmission coefficients analytically .",
    "it is well known that non - linear dynamical systems showing chaotic behaviors often have strange attractors with fractal structures@xcite , but we show that the reverse is also possible .",
    "namely , chaotic dynamics is obtained from a fractal structure . in the following",
    ", we find that , for specific values of wave numbers , the transmission coefficients show chaotic behaviors governed by the logistic map .",
    "for these wave numbers , the transmission coefficients are very sensitive to small changes of parameters of the system such as the index of refraction .",
    "this exotic behavior leads to rapid oscillations of the transmission coefficients as functions of the index of refraction , which could be observed in an optical experiment . for other wave numbers",
    ", our numerical study suggests that light eventually transmits completely or reflects completely for the infinite generation of the cantor sequences @xmath0 .",
    "we will also find intriguing local scaling behaviors of the transmission coefficients near complete transmission , which are distinct from the self - similar structures found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the complete transmission can be regarded as a fixed point of the renormalization - group equation , and the local scaling behaviors are obtained on the basis of the renormalization - group theory .",
    "it will be shown that if complete transmission is achieved at a wave number @xmath1 with a rational @xmath2 , the transmission coefficient around the wave number exhibits a local scaling behavior .",
    "the scaling relation is determined by the rational number @xmath2 through the euler s totient function , and an analytic expression of the scaling function will be presented .",
    "we will also compare the analytical results with numerical data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : formulation ] , we briefly explain the cantor sequences and the cantor - set media .",
    "we then formulate our problem in terms of renormalization - group transformation . in sec.[sec : results ] , we classify wave propagation and find chaotic behaviors of transmission coefficients governed by the logistic map for specific wave numbers .",
    "optical experiments to observe the chaotic behaviors are also proposed .",
    "for other wave numbers , complete transmission and complete reflection of light in the cantor - set media c@xmath5 are numerically suggested . in sec.[sec : results2 ] , scaling behaviors of the transmission coefficients near complete transmission are analyzed on the basis of the renormalization - group equation .",
