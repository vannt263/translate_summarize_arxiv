    "this concept first appeared in @xcite in the context concerning the _ holomorphic homogeneous regular _ manifolds .",
    "but the name squeezing function comes from @xcite ; this concept is closely related to the concept of `` bounded geometry '' by cheng and yau @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from its construction that the squeezing function is a biholomorphic invariant .",
    "recent studies have shown :    if a bounded domain @xmath2 in @xmath3 has a boundary point , say @xmath10 , about which the boundary is strictly pseudoconvex , then @xmath11 .",
    "j. e. fornss asked recently whether its converse is true ( cf .",

    "[ fornaess ] if @xmath2 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary , and if @xmath12 , then is the boundary of @xmath2 strictly pseudoconvex at @xmath10 ?    in a recent article , a. zimmer has shown that the answer is affirmative if the bounded domain is also assumed to be convex @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to present the following result .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath2 be a bounded domain in @xmath13 with smooth pseudoconvex boundary . if @xmath10 is a boundary point of @xmath2 of finite type , in the sense of dangelo @xcite , and if @xmath14 , then @xmath15 is strictly pseudoconvex at @xmath10 .",
    "we remark that our proof is only for complex dimension 2 .",
    "it is mainly due to the limitation of current knowledge concerning the convergence of the scaling methods ( cf .",
    "if the domain is convex and kobayashi hyperbolic for instance , then there is no such restriction . consequently in case the domain is bounded convex , as treated in @xcite , our proof - arguments also answer question [ fornaess ] affirmatively , which we shall put an explication of , in a remark at the end .    on the other hand , as shown recently in @xcite , the answer to question [ fornaess ] is negative if no other conditions on the bounded domain than the boundary being @xmath16 are assumed .",
    "also the high dimensions can imply some unexpected phenomenon @xcite .",
    "thus the hypothesis of the our theorem is in some sense reasonable .",
    "let @xmath2 and the boundary point @xmath17 be as in the hypothesis of the theorem .",
    "let @xmath18 be the unit normal vector to @xmath15 at @xmath10 pointing outward . then take a sequence @xmath19 such that @xmath20 for some @xmath21 satisfying    * @xmath22 for every @xmath23 and * @xmath24 .",
    "we also set @xmath25 for every @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath27 by assumption , there exists , for each @xmath26 , an injective holomorphic map @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all @xmath26 .",
    "the next step is to use the dilation sequence @xmath31 introduced in @xcite , section 2.2 .",

    "2 .   @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   the local defining function @xmath39 of @xmath40 at @xmath41 is represented by @xmath42",
    "where : * @xmath43 is a nonzero real - valued homogeneous subharmonic polynomial of degree @xmath32 with no harmonic terms , * @xmath44 and @xmath45 are real - valued smooth functions satisfying the conditions on the vanishing : order @xmath46 and@xmath47 .",
    "note that the convergences @xmath48 and @xmath49 are uniform on compact subsets of @xmath13 , while @xmath50 is a nonzero real - valued subharmonic polynomial of degree @xmath32 .",

    "if a sequence of holomorphic mappings @xmath66 from @xmath56 to another domain @xmath67 converges uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath58 , then its limit is a holomorphic mapping from @xmath58 into the closure of the domain @xmath67 .",
    "2 .   if a sequence of holomorphic mappings @xmath68 converges uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath67 , if @xmath58 is pseudoconvex , and if there are a point @xmath69 and a constant @xmath70 so that the inequality @xmath71 holds for each @xmath26 , then @xmath72 is a holomorphic mapping from the domain @xmath67 into @xmath58 .    in our construction ,",
    "the set - convergences @xmath73 and @xmath74 are in accordance with the sense of normal set - convergence with @xmath75 notice that @xmath58 is unbounded , so the convergence of the _ forward scaling sequence _",
    "@xmath76 is not immediately obvious . on the other hand",
    ", one easily observes that the inverse sequence ( i.e. , _ the reverse scaling sequence _ ) @xmath55 converges , choosing a subsequence when necessary , by proposition 3.2 and montel s theorem .",
    "so we take a convergent subsequence and call it @xmath55 again , and denote the limit map by @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 , it holds that @xmath79 .",
    "now we show :    @xmath80 is a biholomorphic map .",
    "the proof is almost the same as those for propositions 2.8 and 2.10 of @xcite .",
    "however , the surjectivity part of @xmath77 requires a few , simple but perhaps subtle adjustments .",
    "therefore , we choose to include the detail here .",
    "suppose that @xmath77 is not onto .",
    "then there is a boundary point @xmath81 of @xmath82 in @xmath83 .",
    "notice that @xmath84 converges to @xmath10 since @xmath10 is a peak point of @xmath15 .",
    "denote by @xmath85 .",
    "now we construct a new scaling sequence @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a stretching map ( in the sense of pinchuk ) with respect to @xmath88 as above . in the same way",
    ", there is a subsequential limit map @xmath89 of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the limit domain of the sequence @xmath92 in the sense of normal set - convergence .",
    "we have already observed that @xmath93 is 1 - 1 .",
    "taking a subsequence if necessary , we may assume that the uniform convergence holds for @xmath94 and @xmath95 on compact subsets of @xmath82 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "( see lemma 2.9 in @xcite ) .",
    "denote by @xmath97 .",
    "then the map @xmath98 is well - defined .",
    "actually , @xmath99 , and this , for each @xmath26 , is a polynomial automorphism of @xmath13 with degree less than or equal to @xmath32 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath100 converges to @xmath101 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath102 . by calculation",
    ", @xmath103 turns out to be a polynomial automorphism of @xmath13 of degree less than or equal to @xmath32 .",
    "now proposition 3.2 guarantees that the restriction @xmath104 is a 1 - 1 holomorphic map from @xmath58 into @xmath91 . in a similar way for the inverse sequence @xmath105 ,",
    "the map @xmath106 is a 1 - 1 holomorphic map from @xmath91 into @xmath58 .",
    "hence @xmath107 is a biholomorphism .",
    "denote by @xmath108 .",
    "then @xmath109 by the construction of @xmath103 .",
    "this contradicts that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "so the surjectivity of @xmath77 follows .",
    "we are ready to complete the proof of theorem [ main ] . recall that @xmath112 , where @xmath50 is a nonzero real - valued subharmonic polynomial of degree @xmath32 .",
    "note that the unit ball @xmath83 is biholomorphic to the siegel half space @xmath113 .",
    "so a theorem of oeljeklaus @xcite , which says that these two domains must be affinely biholomorphic , implies in particular that @xmath114 for some @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the origin must have been the boundary point of type 2 in the first place .",
    "since the convergence @xmath115 is uniform on each jet - level , there exist positive contants @xmath116 and @xmath117 such that the smallest eigenvalue of the levi form of each @xmath39 at @xmath41 is larger than @xmath116 whenever @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , the levi form of @xmath119 at @xmath81 is strictly positive - definite .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "notice that the scaling sequence converges without difficulties in case the domain is bounded convex .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "if the boundary point @xmath10 under consideration satisfies the condition @xmath121 and if @xmath10 were of infinite type , then the scaled limit turns out to be a convex domain that contains a one - dimensional disc with a positive radius in its boundary .",
    "@xcite , theorem 3.7 ) .        on the other hand , the preceding arguments imply that this domain has to be biholomorphic to the ball .",
    "but this is impossible , for instance by @xcite .",
    "so the boundary point @xmath10 has to be of finite type .",
    "notice that our arguments work in all dimensions in this case , as the scaling method for bounded convex domains converges regardless of dimension ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
