    "<S> it was concluded that in most practical experimental situations a jj can indeed be described using the effective josephson hamiltonian @xmath10 that directly corresponds to the first josephson relation , with , however , small corrections due to phase fluctuations that originate in its _ electromagnetic environment _ </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , the environment of a jj can have a more dramatic effect : the phase fluctuations generated by an impedance larger than the resistance quantum @xmath11 are expected to suppress the superconducting character of a jj @xcite , and some experiments have confirmed this prediction @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this theory evaluates the incoherent tunneling rate of electrons properly taking into account the probability @xmath0 that the environment absorbs an energy @xmath14 during a tunnel event . while perturbative in tunneling , this theory is nonperturbative in the strength of the coupling to the environment and it can deal with an arbitrary frequency - dependent linear electromagnetic environment . note that it also applies to incoherent cooper pair tunneling in jjs at finite sub - gap voltages . </S>",
    "<S> its predictions were shown to be quantitative in a number of experiments , in particular when the environment consists of resonators @xcite . here , by generalizing poet to the dc josephson effect , a coherent flow of cooper pairs through the junction , we obtain a unified nonperturbative treatment of arbitrary environmental effects in both normal and superconducting tunnel junctions . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> we show that one is lead naturally to introduce a self - consistent mean - field electrodynamic response of the junction , something that , as far as we know , has not been done explicitly previously for jjs . in this formulation </S>",
    "<S> the junction is systematically and properly combined with the rest of the circuit , resulting in an intuitive picture of the system . in the case when the phase fluctuations are small we work out the linear response of the junction and a simple iterative scheme to evaluate a renormalized @xmath8 and its admittance . as an illustrative example , we work out the self - consistency for a jj in an ohmic environment at zero temperature . in the conclusion </S>",

    "<S> this expression generalizes poet in real - time formulation @xcite . in the case where phase fluctuations are negligible @xmath70 , and </S>",
    "<S> one recovers all standard results on jj , such as , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , the temperature dependence of the critical current @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we will see below that @xmath68 should in principle depend on @xmath3 ( albeit weakly in usual cases ) , thus yielding additional terms that cause a departure from the purely sinusoidal current - phase relation predicted by josephson .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider finite phase fluctuations and first assume that the degrees of freedom generating these fluctuations can be regarded as a linear impedance @xmath72 as in the usual poet @xcite . such fluctuations are then gaussian and consequently @xmath68 can be expressed in terms of only the two - point correlator @xmath73 . as </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath74 can in turn be evaluated from the spectral density of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> namely @xmath75 here we have also introduced the usual poet notation @xmath76 @xcite . replacing @xmath77 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i0eff1 ] ) we can pull out of the integral the renormalization factor @xmath78 ,  which plays a major role in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> note that , unless @xmath79 or smaller , @xmath80 ( signaling thermal or quantum phase diffusion ) , yielding @xmath81 and thus @xmath82 this might seem surprising since in most cases when one measures a jj , it is connected to a circuit that contains normal metal at room temperature ( with finite dc resistance ) , but its critical current is nevertheless measured finite . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent paradox is resolved when one considers the jj as being part of its own electromagnetic environment [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] : a superconducting jj perfectly shunts the rest of the circuit at zero frequency , preventing phase diffusion and the divergence of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , doing so is actually the only way to enforce an amplitude and a dynamics of the phase fluctuations in the system that are actually consistent with the presence of the junction , unlike in standard poet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this inclusion of the junction in its own environment can also be justified microscopically : a typical metallic tunnel junction contains a very large number @xmath84 of independent landauer channels that only interact through their common phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as seen from each individual channel , the other channels form a ( _ a priori _ nonlinear ) bath whose response is that of the full junction ( up to corrections of order @xmath85 ) and which are treated like the rest of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> let us stress also that in typical tunnel junctions even if the junction s conductance is large , its individual channels remain very weakly transmissive . </S>",
    "<S> hence , lowest order perturbation in tunneling is sufficient and all the complications in the behavior of the jj arise solely from the electromagnetic interaction among the channels and with the environment , which treat here in a self - consistent mean - field manner . </S>",
    "<S> such a self - consistent mean - field approach of poet has been successfully checked experimentally in low - resistance normal - state junctions @xcite , and , in that case , when the junction is described as a linear element ( see below ) , this was shown to correspond to a self - consistent harmonic approximation that minimizes the free energy in the path integral description of the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us finally remark that in this mean - field approach the superconducting character of the jj gives rise to a chicken - and - egg situation that requires a self - consistent solution , much like for the value of @xmath31 in bcs theory itself .    </S>",
    "<S> we now close the loop by working out the self - consistency in the linear regime assumed in this part . within this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , the response of the junction can be obtained from a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite and is expressed as an admittance @xmath86 that is exact at lowest order in perturbation @xcite . in this expression @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> is the effective josephson inductance and @xmath88 is the correlator of the current operator @xmath89=@xmath90 through the junction . </S>",
    "<S> this latter definition implies that @xmath91 , readily obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ htht ] ) . in the self - consistent approach </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here we shall then replace @xmath92^{-1 } \\label{zeff}\\ ] ] in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sdelta ] ) , where @xmath18 is the junction capacitance and @xmath93 the impedance of the external circuit as seen from the junction [ see fig.1(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are able to obtain the full dynamics of the system ( and @xmath15 as a by - product ) by solving the self - consistency defined by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ htht ] ) , ( [ y ] ) , ( [ zeff ] ) , ( [ sdelta ] ) , ( [ c++ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can , for instance , be done by iterating from an initial guess such as @xmath94 , @xmath95 being the josephson inductance in the absence of environment . in order to be valid </S>",
    "<S> the iterated solution must be consistent with the assumption of linear behavior of the effective environment , i.e. , @xmath96 so that phase fluctuations do not feel the nonlinearity of the jj . in practice </S>",
    "<S> this means @xmath15 should not be reduced more than a few percent with respect to @xmath8 for this linear approach to be valid . if this later criterion if fulfilled , then the solution obtained is essentially the exact dynamics of the junction at lowest order in tunneling .    </S>",
    "<S> simplifying approximations can be made or not depending on the value of the `` plasma frequency '' @xmath97 defined as the resonance frequency of the purely inductive first term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ y ] ) with the junction s capacitance @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath98 is significantly smaller than @xmath99 , then at low temperature it is a good approximation to keep in @xmath1 only the inductive term , that precisely suppresses the divergence of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this is justified because the integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ y ] ) has only a slight capacitive contribution at frequencies @xmath101 with dissipation setting in only at frequencies close to or above @xmath102 . with this simplification @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> reduces to the impedance of an lc oscillator resonating at @xmath98 damped by the external impedance @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , still in the case when @xmath103 , the characteristic time scale of phase fluctuations ( @xmath104 ) is significantly longer than that of @xmath105 which is @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i0eff1 ] ) , ( [ c++ ] ) we can take the short - time limit @xmath107 , yielding the simple renormalization @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar renormalization of the josephson coupling was obtained at @xmath109 in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see here that this is valid only when @xmath102 is the fastest dynamics in the problem and that the opposite situation can not be treated correctly in approaches starting from the effective josephson hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now fully work out an example in the above simplifying assumption @xmath103 , @xmath108 , and further restricting to the `` ohmic '' case where @xmath110 [ fig.1(c ) ] and zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> then the effective environment reduces to an rlc circuit with impedance @xmath111 for which @xmath112 can be calculated analytically and from which we derive the self - consistency equation @xmath113 where @xmath114 would be the quality factor of the plasma oscillation at @xmath109 , in absence of renormalization . again </S>",
    "<S> , valid solutions must satisfy eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ linearvalid ] ) , that is , @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> however this always fails at @xmath116 where @xmath98 vanishes and where a treatment beyond linear response is needed . </S>",
    "<S> when the approximation is valid ( away from the pathological points ) we predict that the renormalization of @xmath8 is different at @xmath109 and @xmath117 , leading to a slightly anharmonic current - phase relation . </S>",
    "<S> this anharmonicity is a generic feature in the self - consistent approach because it causes @xmath118(t ) in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ htht ] ) to have a @xmath3 dependence through the dynamical response of the jj .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have extended the framework of the poet to address the effect of an arbitrary electromagnetic environment on the josephson effect in metallic tunnel junctions . </S>",
    "<S> doing so we reached a self - consistent description of the josephon effect , sheding new light on the interaction of a jj with its environment , including its dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this notably predicts that the celebrated first josephson relation generically departs from a sinusoid when the impedance of its environment is increased , a fact that should be verifiable experimentally . for strictly dc josephson effect and small phase fluctuations , the self - consistency is fully worked out using the exact linear admittance of the interacting jj , a quantity that is accessible to measurements and that should be useful for quantum circuit engineering . </S>",
    "<S> we think more work in this direction could extend this approach to non - dc situations and non - gaussian phase fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would provide the general `` circuit laws '' for josephson junctions , a quantum nonlinear generalization of the classical `` impedance combination laws . ''    </S>",
