    "the critical volume @xmath134 can be easily computed from @xmath137 .",
    "there are two possible configurations for the critical bubble . for largely negative pressures",
    "the critical bubble is pinned at the outer corner of the t - shaped structure ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : barriere]b ) . for moderately",
    "negative pressures , the critical bubble meets the solid wall with the young contact angle ( green line in fig .  [",
    "fig : barriere]b ) . the atomistic critical volume ( red symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : barriere]b ) are in fair agreement with the macroscopic ones at moderately negative pressures for which the critical bubble is not pinned . in conclusion , the laplace equation predicts rather accurately @xmath134 at the nano scale and over a broad range of pressures .",
    "figure [ fig : salto_valli ] reports the free - energy profile and the cassie - wenzel transition pathway on a hydrophobic cavity for the atomistic ( red dash - dotted lines ) and the macroscopic approaches ( inset ) .",
    "the initial conditions for these rmd simulations are in the cassie state as for the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : profili ] .    both rmd and",
    "cream free - energy profiles show cusps , which are signatures of the transition between orthogonal shallow valleys as discussed in the model potential of section  [ sec : toy ] .",
    "the first cusp , near the wenzel state , is discussed in detail in the next subsection .",
    "the second cusp , at @xmath138 in the red rmd profile , corresponds to the transition between an interface pinned at the inner corner ( right branch ) and one with the liquid touching the cavity bottom ( left branch , see the lower strip in fig .",
    "[ fig : salto_valli ] ) .    as the liquid touches the bottom , the atomistic transition pathway switches between two different configurations : a symmetric one , with two vapor bubbles in the arms of the t - structure and an asymmetric one , with a vapor bubble in only one arm . in the macroscopic profile",
    "these two states correspond to different solutions of the cream equations  .",
    "the occurrence of this morphological transition in rmd can be explained as a thermally activated jump between two shallow valleys , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rare_event]c . in other words",
    ", there is a free - energy barrier in the subspace orthogonal to that spanned by the collective variable @xmath21 which in rmd is overcome by thermal fluctuations .",
    "clearly , the atomistic description can not follow each single branch separately because the orthogonal free - energy barriers are of the order of @xmath3 . on the opposite",
    ", the macroscopic model is capable of following more branches but is unable to jump between any two of them and to evaluate the orthogonal free - energy barriers .",
    "the jump occurring in the atomistic simulations , identified by a star in fig .",
    "[ fig : salto_valli ] , can not be detected simply by looking at the free - energy profile , which is smooth ( no cusps ) .",
    "however , the jump is easily revealed by examining the corresponding density fields along the transition pathways .",
    "the observed abrupt change of configuration corresponds to a jump between the two valleys identified by cream , shown by the orange dashed arrow between the dark and light green profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : salto_valli ] .",
    "these two branches share , at least in cream , the same free - energy gradient . based on the observed agreement between the atomistic and macroscopic results ,",
    "the same mean force is expected in eqn   irrespective of which of the two branches is visited by the dynamics . in this way",
    "the morphological transition is concealed by the thermodynamic integration used to reconstruct the rmd profile ( eqn  ) . the macroscopic expression for the free energy , instead",
    ", is capable of distinguishing the ( absolute , with no undetermined integration constant ) free energy of the two branches revealing that the single bubble configuration is energetically favored .",
    "a second atomistic pathway is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : salto_valli ] , which is generated by choosing the initial condition for the rmd simulations in the wenzel basin ( blue dash - dotted line ) .",
    "it is seen that the pathway selected by these initial conditions is different from the one started from cassie . in particular , the system dynamics can not explore the valley corresponding to two `` symmetric '' menisci because this is at higher free energy by ca .",
    "@xmath139 ( see the orange arrow for cream calculation ) .",
    "thus the system is stuck in asymmetric configurations of the meniscus , which first pins at the lower corner of the re - entrant mouth and eventually detaches from it ( top strip ) .",
    "this result confirms that the free - energy landscape is extremely complex and suggests that for the cassie - wenzel transition and for cavitation two different pathways can be followed . in order to confirm this insight ,",
    "more sophisticated techniques should be used , such as the string method in collective variables @xcite .",
    "similar arguments apply also to the system with hydrophilic chemistry .",
    "however in this case the number of alternatives valleys is very large ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profili]b and esi ) , making a detailed analysis like the one reported for the hydrophobic case very cumbersome .",
    "looking at the free - energy profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : profili ] it appears that , for both chemistries , atomistic and macroscopic models have qualitatively different behaviors close to the wenzel basin : the concave atomistic free energy can be roughly described as a parabola with an upward concavity in contrast with the macroscopic one which has opposite curvature .",
    "strictly speaking , the parabolic approximation is valid only around the wenzel minimum at @xmath140 ; for larger @xmath54 , deviations from parabolicity , the so - called fat tails @xcite , can not be excluded on the basis of the present computations .",
    "the parabolic trend indicates that , close to the wenzel state , the probability distribution @xmath141 for the atomistic collective variable is gaussian as per eqn  .",
    "this behavior is typical of liquids under confinement and accounts for the fluid density fluctuations at the wall @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations can be related to the compressibility of the ( confined ) liquid @xcite .",
    "the upward concavity of the wenzel basin implies a positive compressibility , which is naturally captured by the atomistic system . for the macroscopic case , instead",
    ", the free - energy behavior is completely different since the compressibility vanishes altogether by the sharp - kink approximation ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 are constant ) , entailing a different trend .",
    "this can be made explicit by expanding close to the wenzel state the expression for the macroscopic free energy , which scales as the liquid - vapor surface area @xmath142 , which is quite different from the atomistic scaling @xmath143 .",
    "similar results are found by remsing et al .",
    "@xcite , who investigated the liquid / vapor transition between two flat hydrophobic surfaces of nanometric extension .",
    "they also found that near the pure liquid state the free energy is harmonic as opposed to the @xmath144 trend predicted by the ( incompressible ) classical nucleation theory .",
    "another connection with the present results is the `` kink '' that these authors find in free - energy profiles which could probably be interpreted in the light of the simple model in fig .",
    "[ fig : rare_event ] .",
    "a direct consequence of the upward concavity of the wenzel basin is the existence of a liquid ( or wenzel ) spinodal @xmath145 which has no counterpart in the ( incompressible ) macroscopic model , see the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal]b and in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal]a , respectively .",
    "this reflects the physical fact that superhydrophobicity can be restored at sufficiently low pressures . on the contrary",
    ", the classical nucleation theory fails to capture this feature , predicting finite free energy barriers for all pressures @xcite .    in order to make these observation more quantitative",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal ] the free - energy profiles @xmath146 ( insets ) and their derivative @xmath147 for pressures greater ( red ) and less ( blue ) than the liquid spinodal . for the macroscopic model",
    ", it is seen that the wenzel state is attained by construction at @xmath58 , while the point at which the free - energy derivative jumps from positive to negative values corresponds to the free - energy maximum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal]a ) . decreasing",
    "the pressure amounts to shifting the free - energy derivative @xmath148 by a constant , see eqn  . since , however , @xmath149 has a vertical asymptote for @xmath150 , a maximum always exists in the continuum model .",
    "this maximum is a regular point for large negative pressures , corresponding to a critical bubble nucleating in the corner , while it is a cusp for moderately negative pressures .",
    "this cusp is generated by the presence of two valleys having different slopes , cf .",
    "[ fig : rare_event ] .    in the atomistic case , instead , the free - energy derivative changes sign twice for @xmath151 .",
    "these two stationary points are the wenzel and the transition state , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal]b . upon decreasing pressures , the wenzel state gradually shifts to larger @xmath54 , see also ref .  . when @xmath152 , no stationary point exists and the wenzel state becomes unstable . because of the peculiar shape of the wenzel basin , in the atomistic case the maximum is always attained at the cusp where the free - energy derivative has a discontinuity",
    "in the present work wetting and cavitation on nanostructured surfaces have been studied via molecular dynamics and macroscopic capillarity models .",
    "rare events methods have been used in order to determine the wetting and cavitation pathways and the related free energy barriers , which dictate the thermally activated kinetics of the two phenomena .",
    "the systems considered here consist of a re - entrant nano - cavity with hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemistry , respectively . given the re - entrant geometry , both chemistries allow for the presence of a cassie state .",
    "we have found that the free energy landscape is characterized by many `` valleys '' , indicating that many pathways are possible for wetting and cavitation on nanostructured surfaces .",
    "these pathways and the kinetics of the process strongly depend on the chemistry and on the geometry of the surface , with the hydrophilic chemistry showing the largest number of transition pathways .",
    "the present results allowed for a detailed quantitative comparison of the atomistic and continuum models at the nanoscale .",
    "the major qualitative difference concerns the curvature of the free energy profile close to the wenzel state . for the atomistic model",
    "this curvature is positive , accounting for density fluctuations of the confined liquid @xcite . the macroscopic model , instead",
    ", due to the assumption of liquid incompressibility , does not capture density fluctuations and features a negative curvature .",
    "this discrepancy is reflected in the different ( non - classical ) pathways to wetting and nucleation , which in turn lead to different estimates for the kinetics @xcite .",
    "strictly related to the compressibility is the presence of a liquid spinodal  shifted by confinement as compared to the bulk one  which is only captured by the atomistic model .",
    "quantitative differences emerge in the free energy barriers connected with cavitation , with the macroscopic model ( classical nucleation theory ) overestimating them .",
    "as expected , the largest discrepancies are found away from two - phase coexistence , where the size of the critical bubble becomes nanometric .",
    "the complex free energy landscape connected with wetting and cavitation on structured surfaces has required particular attention in interpreting the results of the rare event atomistic simulations and continuum calculations .",
    "the approximation introduced by a reduced description of the transition in terms of a single variable ( the volume of the vapor bubble ) has been discussed in detail .",
    "this convenient choice , which is normally used , e.g. , in classical nucleation theory , is capable of identifying most of the pathways , but fails when there is a morphological transition @xcite .",
    "sufficient but not necessary symptoms of the failure of a reduced description are the presence of cusps in the free energy profile .",
    "furthermore , thermodynamic integration , which is often used in atomistic free - energy methods , may fail to capture significant free - energy jumps . in order to overcome these limitations ,",
    "a full description of the fluid density field would be required in order to capture the details of the phenomenon and the exact free energy barriers .",
    "these latter results call for a more profound understanding of the coarse grained description of a liquid .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013)/erc grant agreement n. [ 339446 ] .",
