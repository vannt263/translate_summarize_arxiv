    "more than half of the seyfert 1 population shows optical / uv intrinsic absorption associated with their active nucleus ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the strong uv absorption lines , ly@xmath6 , , ( and less frequently and ) are found to be blueshifted , or at rest , with respect to the narrow emission lines , providing an important indication of the presence of a net radial outflow of the absorbing gas .",
    "a similar percentage also shows an associated ionized ( `` warm '' ) x - ray absorber @xcite that is characterized by high ionization , @xmath7@xmath8 ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of ionizing photons ) and high total hydrogen column density , @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 , which signature is typically the presence of and edges . during the last decade evidence has been accumulated indicating that the same gas is responsible for the absorption in the uv and x - ray spectra of seyfert 1s @xcite .",
    "although it is not always possible to model the x - ray / uv absorber as a single zone ( especially when the complex uv absorption is resolved in multiple velocity components that are characterized by a large range of column densities and ionization ) common characteristics of these absorbers have emerged , i.e. , they are composed of high ionization , low density , high column density gas that is outflowing and is located in or outside the broad emission - line region ( belr ) .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate the nature of this nuclear component in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that represents an outflow ( or wind ) that can carry away a significant amount of kinetic energy at a mass - loss rate comparable to the accretion rate required to fuel the agn @xcite .",

    ", in preparation ) we will analyze the intrinsic sed of ark  564 and the properties of the gas responsible for the broad emission lines .",
    "we observed ark  564 with _ fuse _ @xcite for @xmath18ks starting on 2001 june 29 07:37:42 ut . the observations , consisting of 24 separate exposures , were performed in photon address ( time - tag ) mode through the @xmath19 low - resolution ( lwrs ) aperture . during our        observation ,",
    "a high - voltage anomaly occurred , and detector 1 did not collect useful data during the first 8 exposures .",
    "to best model the background for this observation , we first used the task ttag_combine provided with the _ fuse _ calibration pipeline , calfuse ( version 2.0.5 ) , to combine the last 16 exposures for detector 1 ( total exposure of 42ks ) , and all 24 exposures for detector 2 .",
    "we then processed the combined exposures with the standard pipeline and extracted spectra from both detectors .",
    "the flux scale for the final spectra is accurate to @xmath20 , while the wavelength scale is accurate to @xmath21 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 . as a result of the high - voltage anomaly and data screening ,",
    "the effective on - source times were 41ks in detector 1a , 39ks in detector 1b , and 58ks in detector 2a , and 62ks in detector 2b .",
    "consequently , the sic1a and sic1b spectra were discarded from further analysis , the final signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) being @xmath22 even at 0.6 ( 100 pixels ) resolution .",
    "we also discarded the lif1b spectrum since it showed wavelength - dependent differences in flux of up to 3050% compared to the lif1a probably due to the the `` worm '' , which can not be corrected for by the pipeline @xcite .",
    "the full _ fuse _ spectrum was obtained by combining the spectra extracted from the sic2a , lif2b , lif1a , sic2b , and lif2a segments , yielding a wavelength coverage of 916 - 1175 .",
    "we then rebinned the full spectrum in a linear wavelength scale using 0.07 bins ( 10 pixels , here on our full - resolution spectrum , with an effective resolution of 20 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 ) , 0.2 bins ( 30 pixels , medium - resolution spectrum ) , and 0.6 bins ( 100 pixels , low - resolution spectrum ) .",
    "figure  [ fullspec ] shows the low - resolution spectrum after we cosmetically removed the strong airglow lines ( mainly lyman series , @xmath23989 , @xmath231027 , and @xmath23584 seen in second order at 1167 ) and @xmath23977 , which is scattered solar light in the sic detector .",
    "the main spectral features are identified , the most prominent being the emission lines of the @xmath0 resonance doublet .",
    "strong absorption features due to ly@xmath24 and @xmath0 at velocities near the redshift of ark  564 are also observed .",

    "our goal was to determine the column densities of the ionic species we observed in our spectrum , combine this information with the column densities available in the literature for ark  564 , and derive constraints on the physical parameters of the absorber ( total density and ionization ) through photoionization modeling .",
    "_ hst_/fos spectra of ark  564 @xcite show the presence of strong intrinsic absorption lines of ly@xmath6 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . of these lines , which are resolved in stis spectra into multiple components ( paper ii , paper iv ) , ly@xmath6 , , and",

    "figure  [ o6spec ] shows the _ fuse _ full - resolution ( 0.07 , 10 pixels ) spectrum of akn  564 , in the ly@xmath24/ wavelength region .",
    "close examination of the troughs shows that the lines are heavily saturated , and their shape is mainly determined by partial covering effects ( see  [ als ] and figure  [ h2normflux ] below ) .",
    "therefore , the absorption lines are not resolved into components at different velocities with respect to the systemic velocity , and we must treat each of the absorption troughs as a single absorption component , and we can only determine the velocity - averaged column densities of the observed species .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath29 is not completely black .",
    "indeed , analysis of the spectra obtained with different pulse height restrictions and from night - only data ( we did not use the latter for this work , since the lower s / n did not allow a proper subtraction of galactic molecular hydrogen ) shows that scattered light is marginal in this observation , and that there is no filling in of the absorption troughs .",
    "it is also clear that the uncertainty in the measurement of absorption line parameters , hence column density , is dominated by the uncertainty in the underlying emission - line profile .",
    "additionally , there is contamination from absorption lines of galactic molecular hydrogen , with a column density log @xmath30 ( k.  r.  sembach 2002 , private communication ) ; this is not surprising , given the substantial amount of neutral atomic hydrogen ( @xmath31 @xmath13 , @xcite ) along the line of sight toward ark  564 .",
    "given these limitations , we proceeded as follows : we determined a power - law continuum underlying the ly@xmath24/ wavelength region using the low - resolution spectrum ( s / n @xmath3215 in the continuum ) ; we then modeled the ly@xmath24 and emission lines from the high- and medium - resolution spectra ( s / n @xmath33 in the emission lines for high - resolution ) , and used h@xmath25 templates to estimate the h@xmath25 contribution to the absorption troughs .",
    "this part of the        analysis was done using the iraf task specfit @xcite in the stsdas package . finally , we measured the absorption line parameters of the normalized line profiles using the high - resolution spectrum , and determined the column densities with the apparent optical depth method , which we briefly describe below (  [ als ] ) .",
    "in addition to the power - law continuum ( that we kept fixed relative to the fit of the low - resolution spectrum ) our models for the adopted `` continuum '' under the absorption troughs included a pair of broad emission lines ( fwhm @xmath345000 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 ) , a pair of narrow emission lines ( fwhm @xmath351100 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 ) , and a broad and narrow ly@xmath24 emission lines .",
    "all lines are taken to have gaussian profiles .",
    "the intensity of the doublet lines was fixed to the optically thin value 2:1 for both broad and narrow lines , while their wavelengths were linked to the ratio of their laboratory values ; the fwhm and wavelength of the broad ly@xmath24 line were linked to the ones of the lines , though a small shift in wavelength was permitted , consistent with increasing blueshift with respect to the systemic velocity as the ionization increases .    to assess the possible range of absorption - line parameters",
    ", we considered five different models for the emission lines ,        shown in figure  [ o6spec ] , namely , low - lying ( low ) , medium ( med1 and med2 ) , and high - lying ( high , that best follows the @xmath36 peak , though it clearly over - predicts the @xmath29 peak ) .",
    "in all four cases the gaussian profiles for the emission lines were symmetrical .",
    "as observed in many agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission lines in all our models are blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift @xmath37 as derived from measurements @xcite by 3901240 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 .",
    "finally , we considered a model in which the broad lines have the least blueshift ( 100 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 ) with respect to the systemic redshift , and the narrow lines are at the systemic redshift ; in this case , in order to model the profile , the narrow emission lines must be highly asymmetrical ( skewness @xmath38 ) .",
    "the motivation for considering the last model is the increasing evidence that the high - ionization emission lines in nls1s are broader and present an excess of flux in the blue with respect to the low - ionization lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . with our choice of low , med1 , med2 , and high",
    "emission line profiles the absorption is redshifted with respect to the emission lines .",
    "this is highly unusual , though not unprecedented @xcite . when modeling the emission with the skew profile , the absorption is in part blueshifted , in part redshifted with respect to the emission lines .",
    "table  [ emissionpars ] lists the model emission - line parameters .",
    "since no inflection points are clearly seen in the observed emission line profiles , our models may not have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "also , while we believe the true shape of the emission line        profile may be most realistically represented by the med1 and med2 profiles , we consider the most extreme profiles ( low , high and skew ) to bracket the constraints on the values of column density .",
    "our spectrum also shows narrow h@xmath25 and absorption - lines from the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) in the ly@xmath24/ wavelength region ; in particular , the top panel of figure  [ h2normflux ] shows six of such absorption lines that lie outside the absorption troughs , which we fit as gaussians with specfit ( fwhm @xmath39 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 ) .",
    "we then used h@xmath25 and absorption - line templates ( s.  mccandliss 2001 , private communication ; k.  r.  sembach 2002 , private communication ) to predict the position of the lines in the absorption troughs and derive their intensity by scaling them to the two lines at @xmath40 .",
    "incidentally , we note a 0.115 shift between the predicted and observed wavelengths of h@xmath25 absorption lines .",
    "the amount of this shift is constant along our spectrum , hence we interpreted it as a residual zero - point offset in the wavelength calibration of our spectrum ; as reported in many observations[multiblock footnote omitted ] , these offsets can be as high as 0.25 in the lwrs aperture .",
    "we matched templates and spectra accordingly .",
    "figure  [ h2normflux ] shows the line profiles normalized with respect to the combined continuum , emission - line , and h@xmath25 profiles , for the five different emission - line models .      as mentioned above , the lines are so heavily saturated that we must treat each of the absorption troughs as a single absorption component ( as opposed to the many components observed in and @xmath41 ; paper iv ) .",
    "this assumption is only strictly valid if the physical conditions are approximately constant along the line profile , i.e. , as a function of radial velocity .",
    "we consired the possibility of partial covering of the lines and used the apparent optical depth method to determine the column densities .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the lower limit to the line - of - sight covering factor @xmath42 from the residual intensities @xmath43 in the troughs as a function of radial velocity , and the corresponding apparent optical depth @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the assumed continuum intensity across the absorption line ( in the case of , @xmath47 is our combined power - law continuum and the emission line models corrected for the galactic hydrogen absorption as described in  [ els ] ) .",
    "column densities are then obtained by integrating the apparent optical depth across the line profile using ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath48 where @xmath23 and @xmath49 are the laboratory wavelength and oscillator strength of the transition , respectively .",

    "predictably , @xmath50 for most of the @xmath36 profile and is consistent with unity for @xmath29 .",
    "the arrows show the position of the zero velocity with respect to the broad emission lines ( bel ) and narrow emission lines ( nel ) . as noted in ",
    "[ els ] , while most of the absorption is blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift , the absorption troughs are completely or at least partially ( skew model ) redshifted with respect to the broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the absorption troughs also show the presence of gas which is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "this may indicate that the absorbing gas is undergoing net radial infall , as is the case for ngc 5548 @xcite and rx j0134 - 42 @xcite .",

    "finally , we can compare our solutions of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , with the preliminary results of @xcite based on analysis of a 50ks _ chandra _ observation of ark  564 .",
    "their curve of growth analysis on the absorption lines indicates that @xmath126 @xmath13 , @xmath127 @xmath13 , @xmath128 @xmath13 , and @xmath129 @xmath13 , suggestive of @xmath130 and @xmath1312 . while there is agreement between the values of @xmath89 and @xmath132 , the column densities they measure for do not agree with the ones derived in paper iv from the upper limits on the bound - free optical depths in the _ asca _ spectrum ( paper i ) .",
    "given the high @xmath133 we would expect an edge would be observable in the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "we have presented a 63ks _ fuse _ observation of the nls1 galaxy ark  564 .",
    "the observed spectrum is dominated by the @xmath0 emission lines . as observed in many agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission lines in all our models are blueshifted ( or at rest , as in the case of our skew blue - asymmetric model ) with respect to the systemic redshift by 1001240 ^ -1 km s@xmath17 .",
    "blue - asymmetric uv emission line profiles may be a characteristic of nls1 galaxies .",
    "we concentrated on the analysis of the strong and heavily saturated absorption troughs due to lyman series , and @xmath1 , which are observed at velocities near the systemic redshift of ark  564 . in a forthcoming paper ( romano et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will analyze the intrinsic sed of ark  564 and the properties of the belr gas . using the apparent optical depth method ,",
    "we have determined that the column density of is a few @xmath134 @xmath13 , and @xmath122 @xmath13 .",
    "we used these values in conjunction with the published column densities of species observed in the uv and x - ray spectra of this object to derive constraints on the physical parameters of the uv / x - ray absorbing gas through photoionization modeling .",
    "the combination of constraints , assuming the most realistic sed , indicates that the absorber is characterized by a narrow range of density and ionization parameter , @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the kinematic properties of the uv absorber emerging from the combined analysis of the _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra , i.e.   distribution of gas in radial velocity ( as derived from the extent of the absorption troughs ) and net radial velocity ( as derived from the velocity centroids ) .",
    "the uv / x - ray absorber in ark  564 is in outflow with respect to the systemic redshift with a radial velocity of a few hundred ^-1 km s@xmath17 , and it is likely spatially extended along the line of sight .",
    "the absorption troughs also show the presence of gas which is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "this may indicate that a component in the absorbing gas is undergoing net radial infall .",
    "this is highly unusual , though not unprecedented @xcite .",
    "pr and sm acknowledge support through nasa grant nag5 - 10320 .",
    "we thank the _ fuse _ team for the operation of their satellite , and k.  r.   sembach and s.  mccandliss for sharing their molecular hydrogen absorption templates .",
    "we thank s.  vercellone for useful discussions .",
