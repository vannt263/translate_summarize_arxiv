    "entanglement  @xcite is the key concept in quantum information theory .",
    "it has played a crucial role in experiments on quantum computing and quantum teleportation .",
    "this resulted in intensive interest to the physics of entanglement from both theorists and experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "entanglement is detected with the help of a so - called entanglement witness ( ew ) . by definition",
    ", ew is an observable which has a positive expectation value for separable states and negative for some entangled states  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "internal energy  @xcite and magnetic susceptibility  @xcite were used as ew in some cases . in this paper",
    "we propose a new type of an entanglement witness , the intensity of multiple quantum coherences in spin systems .",
    "this quantity is accessible in nmr experiments and thus opens a new approach to probing entanglement with highly advanced nmr techniques .    in the present work we focus on the simplest relevant system , a pair of spins @xmath0 coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction in the conditions of the multiple - quantum ( mq ) nmr experiment  @xcite . here",
    "the initial thermodynamic density matrix describing the interaction of the spins with the strong external magnetic field is subjected to the irradiation by the specially tailored sequence of resonance rf - pulses .",
    "the anisotropic dipolar hamiltonian oscillates rapidly when the period of the sequence is less than the inverse dipolar frequency .",
    "the spin dynamics of the system is described by the averaged hamiltonian which is responsible for the emergence of the mq coherences of the zeroth and plus / minus second orders  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the initial state of the system is separable .",
    "however we show with the wootters criterion  @xcite that the entangled state emerges when the intensity of the mq coherence of order 2 ( -2 ) exceeds the exactly calculated threshold depending on the external magnetic field and the temperature .",
    "thus the intensity of the mq coherence of the second order , which is the observable in mq nmr experiments , serves as ew for spin systems .",
    "we consider a two - spin system in a strong external magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium density matrix , @xmath2 of the system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) , @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the projection of the angular spin momentum operator of spin @xmath9 on the axis @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the partition function .",
    "the mq nmr experiment consists of four distinct periods of time : preparation , evolution , mixing , and detection  @xcite .",
    "mq coherences are created by the multipulse sequence consisting of eight - pulse cycles on the preparation period  @xcite . in the rotating reference frame",
    "@xcite , the average hamiltonian , @xmath12 for the two - spin system describing the mq dynamics at the preparation period can be written as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coupling constant between spins 1 and 2 , @xmath15 is the distance between spins 1 and 2 , and @xmath16 is the angle between the internuclear vector @xmath17 and the external magnetic field @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 are the rasing and lowering operators of spin @xmath22    the two - spin hamiltonian @xmath23 can be diagonalized with the transformation ( in the standard basis @xmath24 and the density matrix , @xmath25 at the end of the preparation period is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 the diagonal part of the density matrix of eq .",

    "( [ rhot])([rhoht ] ) one can find that @xmath37 it is worth to emphasize that intensities of mq coherences are observables in mq nmr experiments .",
    "( [ cohs ] ) shows that the intensities of the mq coherences of the second order , @xmath38 and the minus second order , @xmath39 are equal .",
    "however , in real experiment , certain errors are present and the experimental results for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are not the same .",
    "some of the errors can be compensated and the accuracy can be improved if one detects the sum of these coherences@xcite .",
    "it is also worth to notice that the accuracy of the measurement of @xmath42 is higher than for @xmath43 @xcite . below we will use the sum of the mq coherences of the plus / minus second order in order to introduce the entanglement witness",
    "the initial state of the system determined by eq .",
    "( [ rho0 ] ) is separable .",
    "entanglement appears in the course of the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment when the mq coherence of the second order has a sufficiently large intensity . in order to estimate the entanglement quantitatively",
    "we apply the wootters criterion  @xcite . according to  @xcite",
    ", one needs to construct the spin - flip density matrix @xmath44 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation in the standard basis @xmath45 and the pauli matrix @xmath46 the concurrence of the two  spin system with the density matrix @xmath47 is equal to  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the product @xmath53 using eqs .",
