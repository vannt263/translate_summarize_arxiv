    "the dynamics of a system composed by two heavy quarks is well understood in terms of a potential interaction ( static plus relativistic corrections ) obtained from the semirelativistic reduction of the qcd dynamics @xcite .    if at least one of the quarks is light the system behaves relativistically ( the light quark can no more be considered static ) and a pure relativistic treatment becomes necessary ( via dirac or bethe ",
    "salpeter equations ) .",
    "a lot of phenomenologically justified relativistic equations can be found in the literature but up to now we miss a relativistic treatment which follows directly from qcd .",
    "our work goes in this direction . in order to simplify the problem we focus on the heavy - light mesons in the non - recoil limit ( i. e. infinitely heavy antiquark ) . only at the end",
    "we will briefly discuss the two - body case .",
    "our starting point is the quark - antiquark gauge - invariant green function taken in the infinite mass limit of one particle .",
    "the only dynamical assumption is on the behaviour of the wilson loop ( i. e. on the nature of the non - perturbative vacuum ) .",
    "the gauge invariance of the formalism guarantees that the relevant physical information are preserved at any step of our derivation . in this way",
    "we obtain a qcd justified fully relativistic interaction kernel for the quark in the infinite mass limit of the antiquark .",
    "this kernel reduces in some region of the physical parameters to the heavy quark mass potential , and leads in some other region to the heavy quark sum rules results , providing in this way an unified description .",
    "we discuss our result with respect to the old - standing problem of the lorentz structure of the dirac kernel for a confining interaction @xcite .",
    "the main results presented here can be found in @xcite .",
    "the quark - antiquark green function is given in the quenched approximation by @xmath1 where the points @xmath2 are defined as in fig .",
    "[ figwilsonh ] , @xmath3 means the normalized average over the gauge field @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the fermion propagator in the external field @xmath4 associated with the particle @xmath6 and the strings @xmath7 are needed in order to have gauge invariant initial and final bound states . a very convenient way to represent",
    "it is the so - called feynman ",
    "schwinger representation ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , where the fermion propagators are expressed in terms of quantomechanical path integrals over the quark trajectories ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xmath10 from eq .",
    "( [ ginv2 ] ) it emerges quite manifestly that the entire dynamics of the system depends on the wilson loop : @xmath11 being @xmath12 the closed curve defined by the quark trajectories and the endpoint strings @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in order to treat a simpler case ,",
    "let us assume , now , that the antiquark moving on the second fermion line becomes infinitely heavy . the only trajectory surviving in the path integral of eq .",
    "( [ ginv2 ] ) associated with the second particle is the static straight line propagating from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding wilson loop of the system is represented in fig .",
    "[ figwilsonh ] .",
    "as already noted in @xcite in this case it turns out to be convenient to choose the following gauge condition : @xmath17 notice that this gauge choice is possible since the formalism is completely gauge invariant . within this gauge",
    "it is possible to express the gauge field in terms of the field strength tensor , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "moreover the only non - vanishing contribution to the wilson loop is given by the quark paths connecting @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and we have @xmath23    -1truecm = 7.5truecm -4truecm    -0.5truecm    as shown in @xcite in order to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ ginv2 ] ) we need to know the wilson loop average over the gauge fields .",
    "we evaluate it via the cumulant expansion described in @xcite . keeping only bilocal cumulants",
    "we obtain : @xmath24 assumption ( [ svm ] ) corresponds to the so - called stochastic vacuum model . inserting expression ( [ svm ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ ginv2 ] ) and expanding the exponential we obtain the following expression for the propagator @xmath25 of the quark ( which is @xmath26 `` projected '' on the first fermion line ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the free fermion propagator .",
    "taking into account only the first planar graph ( since we are interested only in contributions proportional to the gluon condensate ) , we have @xmath29 . a graphical representation of @xmath30 is given in fig .",
    "[ figfockh ] .",
    "( [ sdexp ] ) can be written in closed form as @xmath31 ( or in terms of the wave - function , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 can be interpreted as the interaction kernel of the dirac equation associated with the motion of a quark in the field generated by an infinitely heavy antiquark .    -2 truecm = 6truecm -0.5 truecm    -0.5 truecm    assuming that the correlator @xmath34 depends only on the difference between the coordinates , we define : @xmath35 with this assumption @xmath30 can be written in momentum space as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "equation ( [ kmom ] ) is our basic expression .",
    "it contains the perturbative interaction up to order @xmath40 and the non - perturbative one carried by a single insertion of a second order cumulant . from now on we want to focus our attention only on the purely non - perturbative interaction .",
    "the lorentz structure of the non - perturbative relevant part of @xmath41 is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gluon condensate , @xmath44 the identity matrix of su(3 ) and @xmath45 is a non - perturbative form factor normalized to unit at the origin .",
    "lattice simulations have shown that @xmath45 falls off exponentially ( in euclidean space - time ) at long distances with a correlation length @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite this behaviour of @xmath45 is sufficient to give confinement at least in some kinematic regions .",
    "we notice here that the most general form of @xmath47 could also contain a term of the type @xmath48 where @xmath49 is another unknown non - perturbative form factor . since this is the lorentz structure of the perturbative part of @xmath50 , it is not surprising to discover that , substituting eq .",
    "( [ ddd1 ] ) inside the wilson loop in the large time separation limit , the terms depending on @xmath49 give rise to the kernel @xmath51 which is of the coulomb type .",
    "the treatment of this kernel is trivial and gives contribution of the perturbative type .",
    "therefore in this work we will not consider terms containing @xmath49 .    in",
    "what follows we study expression ( [ kmom ] ) for different choices of the parameters which are the correlation length @xmath52 , the mass @xmath53 , the binding energy @xmath54 and the momentum transfer @xmath55 .    _",
    "a. heavy quark potential case _ ( @xmath56 )",
    "if we assume @xmath52 to be bigger than the binding energy @xmath54 and smaller than the mass @xmath53 of the quark , since @xmath57 gev , the quark turns out to be sufficiently heavy to be considered non - relativistic . in order to obtain the @xmath58 potential we can neglect the `` negative energy states '' contributions to ( [ kmom ] ) by writing @xmath59 now , inserting eq .",
    "( [ ddd ] ) and by means of the usual reduction techniques , we obtain up to order @xmath58 the static and spin dependent potential @xmath60 this result agrees with the one body limit of the potential given in @xcite . in particular for @xmath61 identifying the string tension @xmath62 we obtain the well - known eichten and feinberg result @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "we observe that the lorentz structure which gives origin to the negative sign in front of the spin - orbit potential in ( [ ef ] ) is in our case not simply a scalar ( @xmath65 ) .    _",
    "b. sum rules case _",
    "( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) let us consider now the case in which the binding energy of the quark is bigger than the correlation length , which can be considered zero respect to all the scales of the problem .",
    "we have @xmath68 in particular from eq .",
    "( [ kmomb ] ) we obtain the well - known leading contribution to the heavy quark condensate @xcite : @xmath69    _ c. light quark case _ ( @xmath70 ) since we have reproduced the known results concerning heavy quarks , eq .",
    "( [ kmom ] ) should maintain some physical meaning also when considering heavy - light mesons with a strange quark ( like d@xmath71 and b@xmath71 ) . in this case",
    "the light quark mass is smaller than @xmath52 : @xmath72 200 mev @xmath73 gev .",
    "actually the case @xmath70 has to be considered as the only realistic one concerning heavy - light mesons . under this condition",
    "either the exponent @xmath74 as well as @xmath75 can be neglected with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath76 we observe that in the zero mass limit this expression gives a chirally symmetric interaction ( while a purely scalar interaction breaks chiral symmetry at any mass scale ) .",
    "this means on one side that our interaction keeps the main feature of qcd i. e. in the zero mass limit chiral symmetry is broken only spontaneously . on the other side this seems to suggest that for very light quarks the projectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 which appear in ( [ kmomc ] ) should be taken from the chiral broken solution of the corresponding dyson  schwinger equation .",
    "in the literature , also recently , a dirac equation with scalar confining kernel ( i. e. @xmath79 ) has been used in order to evaluate non - recoil contributions to the heavy - light meson spectrum @xcite . the main argument in favor of this type of kernel is the nature of the spin - orbit potential for heavy quarks .",
    "this turns out to have a long - range vanishing magnetic contribution ( according to the buchmller picture of confinement ) and is completely described by the thomas precession term .",
    "this situation is compatible with a scalar confining kernel .",
    "however , assuming more sophisticated confinement models with a bigger sensitivity to the intermediate distance region , the spin - orbit interaction has no more such a simple behaviour .",
    "in particular non zero corrections to the magnetic spin - orbit potential show up .",
    "moreover , the velocity dependent sector of the potential seems not to be compatible with a scalar kernel ( we refer the reader to @xcite for an exhaustive discussion ) . therefore also from the point of view of the potential theory there are strong indications that the lorentz structure of the confining kernel should be more complicate that a simple scalar one .",
    "this emerges also in our approach .",
    "the kernel ( [ kmom ] ) follows simply from the assumption on the gauge fields dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ svm ] ) and by taking only one non - perturbative gluon insertion on the quark fermion line .",
    "when performing the potential reduction of this kernel in the heavy quark case ( _ a _ ) we obtain exactly the expected static and spin - dependent potentials .",
    "therefore our conclusion is that there exists at least one non scalar kernel which reproduces for heavy quark not only the eichten and feinberg potentials in the long distances limit , but also the entire stochastic vacuum model spin - dependent potential .",
    "moreover when considering @xmath52 , the inverse of the correlation length , small with respect to all the energy scales ( case _ b _ ) , the kernel ( [ kmom ] ) gives back the leading heavy quark sum rules results .",
    "it is possible to try to extend the range of applicability of eq .",
    "( [ kmom ] ) to more realistic cases , like d@xmath71 and b@xmath71 mesons where the light quark mass is smaller than the characteristic correlation length of the two point cumulant ( case _ c _ ) .",
    "the relevant part of the kernel is also in this case not a simply scalar one .",
    "we mention that a similar picture of the lorentz structure of the confining dirac kernel emerges also in the different approach of @xcite .",
    "an attempt to extend the present approach to the two - body case is given in @xcite .",
    "the equivalent graphs of fig .",
    "[ figfockh ] seem to play a crucial role ( in the two - body case such kind of graph exists for any fermion line and as exchange graph ) .",
    "nevertheless these graphs are not sufficient in order to provide a complete relativistic description of the two - body system .",
    "the main difficulty is that in this case it does not exist a gauge like ( [ gauge ] ) which automatically cancels the contributions coming from the end - point strings .",
    "these contributions are necessary in order to restore gauge invariance . from this point of view",
    "the situation seems to be quite more complicate than in the heavy - light system which remains the most natural context to test the formalism .",
