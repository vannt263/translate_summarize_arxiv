    "however , by neglecting all types of interactions , particularly that of visible matter , we restrict the application of the 3-fluid model to beyond the epoch of matter - radiation decoupling ( @xmath273  @xcite ) .",

    "it is a good approximation to neglect radiation .",
    "it is now easy to see that the pressureless barotropic fluid represents baryons .",
    "in fact , at late times ( but well before formation of structures ) , as the temperature drops by the effect of the expansion , baryons behave as a nonrelativistic  monoatomic \" ideal gas with pressure @xmath284 and mass density @xmath285 that is sum of rest mass and kinetic energy densities provided @xmath286 .",

    "these are the known cases where the barotropic fluid has applications in the context of a . the case of a kination or stiff matter , which corresponds to @xmath146 , may be relevant at early times if interactions are taken into considerations . however , some authors argue that interactions could still be neglected in this case and considered a ( massless and free ) kination along with a de - scalar - field component with exponential potential  @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath146 would generalize the investigation made in  @xcite by including a non - interacting dm component . specifically , this generalizes the two repellers @xmath137 , which correspond to singularities in the scalar field , to the semi - circle @xmath298 of fig .

    "we have obtained attractor solutions where both de and dm coexist and the late - time density is shared according to @xmath257 and @xmath302 in a way independent of the value of @xmath166 .",
    "the case of a pressureless barotropic fluid ( @xmath55 ) is more interesting and has a one - parameter family of attractors where all components coexist with , as before , @xmath257 but @xmath264 .",

    "we have also noticed that , for @xmath24 , a tpa occurs as the state of the universe approaches the intermediate state defined by the saddle point @xmath187 ( where both kinetic and potential energies are zero ) , which lasts longer than other tpa s occurring away from saddle points ( where the kinetic energy has a minimum and the potential energy has a maximum ) . to our knowledge , such a conclusion was never discussed in other s with interactions .",
