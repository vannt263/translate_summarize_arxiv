    "the role played by disorder on the nature of collective excitations in condensed matter physics has been the subject of intensive studies due to its relevance in defining general transport characteristics  @xcite .",
    "usually , disorder induces localization of collective excitations thus degrading transport properties , an effect that is largely pronounced in low dimensions .",
    "in particular , the one - electron eigen - states in the one - dimensional anderson model with site - diagonal uncorrelated disorder are exponentially localized for any degree of disorder  @xcite .",
    "however , several one - dimensional models with correlated disorder have been proposed which exhibit delocalized states  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the one - dimensional anderson model with long - range correlated disorder presents a phase of extended electronic states  @xcite .",
    "these results have been confirmed by microwave transmission spectra of single - mode waveguides with inserted correlated scatters  @xcite .",
    "the above results have motivated the study of further model systems that can be mapped onto the anderson model and , therefore , expected to present a similar transition between localized and extended collective excitations .",
    "recently , a study concerning the one - dimensional quantum heisenberg ferromagnet with exchange couplings exhibiting long - range correlated disorder reported some finite - size scaling evidences of the emergence of a phase of extended low - energy excitations  @xcite . by using a renormalization group calculation the existence of such phase of extended spin - waves",
    "was confirmed and the scaling of the mobility edge with the degree of correlation was obtained  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that , associated with the emergence of extended spin - waves in the low - energy region , the wave - packet mean - square displacement exhibits a long - time ballistic behavior .    the collective vibrational motion of one - dimensional disordered harmonic chains of @xmath5 random masses can also be mapped onto an one - electron tight - binding model  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , most of the normal vibrational modes are localized .",
    "however , there are a few low - frequency modes not localized , whose number is of the order of @xmath6 , in which case the disordered chains behaves like the disorder - free system  @xcite .",
    "futher , it was shown that correlations in the mass distribution produce a new set of non - scattered modes in this system  @xcite .",
    "non - scattered modes have also been found in disordered harmonic chain with dimeric correlations in the spring constants  @xcite . by using analytical arguments , it was also demonstrated that the transport of energy in mass - disordered ( uncorrelated and correlated ) harmonic chains is strongly dependent on non - scattered vibrational modes as well as on the initial excitation  @xcite . for impulse initial excitations ,",
    "uncorrelated random chains have a superdiffusive behavior for the second moment of the energy distribution [ @xmath7 , while for initial displacement excitations a subdiffusive spread takes place [ @xmath8 .",
    "the dependence of the second moment spread on the initial excitation was also obtained in ref .",
    "moreover , correlations induced by thermal annealing have been shown to enhance the localization length of vibrational modes , although they still present an exponential decay for distances larger than the thermal correlation length  @xcite .",
    "recently the thermal conductivity on harmonic and anharmonic chains of uncorrelated random masses  @xcite , as well as of the chain of hard - point particles of alternate masses  @xcite , has been numerically investigated in detail .",
    "the main issue here is whether the systems display finite thermal conductivity in the thermodynamic limit , a question that remains controversial  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of collective modes in the presence of long - range correlated disorder for the case of vibrational modes .",
    "we will consider harmonic chains with long - range correlated random masses assumed to have spectral power density @xmath9 . by using a transfer matrix calculation",
    ", we obtain accurate estimates for the lyapunov exponent , defined as the inverse of the degree of localization @xmath10 of the vibrational modes .",
    "we show that , for @xmath11 , this model also presents a phase of extended modes in the low frequency region .",
    "this result is confirmed by participation ratio measurements from an exact diagonalization procedure and finite size scaling arguments .",
    "the spatial evolution of an initially localized excitation is also studied by computing the spread of the second moment of the energy distribution , @xmath3 .",
    "we find that , associated with the emergence of a phase of delocalized modes , a ballistic energy spread takes place .",
    "we consider a disordered harmonic chain of @xmath5 masses , for which the equation of motion for the displacement @xmath12 of the _ n_-th mass with vibrational frequency @xmath13 is  @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the mass at the _ n_-th site and @xmath16 is the spring constant that couples the masses @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "we use units in which @xmath18 . in the present harmonic chain model , we take the masses @xmath15 following a random sequence describing the trace of a fractional brownian motion  @xcite : @xmath19^{1/2 } \\cos{\\left ( \\frac{2\\pi nk}{n } + \\phi_k\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the wave - vector of the modulations on the random mass landscape and @xmath20 are @xmath21 random phases uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath22 $ ] . the exponent @xmath23 is directly related to the hurst exponent @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) of the rescaled range analysis . in order to avoid vanishing masses",
