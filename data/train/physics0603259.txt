    "the control problem on a network - wide level becomes often practically unsolvable by these methods , especially in larger networks .",
    "+ moreover , most of the material flow networks are subject to continuous demand variations and unforeseen failures . besides adaptivity and optimality , robustness and flexibility are important requirements for control concepts .",
    "+ can we learn from the stable , smooth , and efficient flow of nutrients and other chemical substances in circulatory systems of biological organisms ?",
    "synchronised dynamics of a population of cells often plays an important role for it @xcite .",
    "for example , our heart functions as a pump through the appropriate synchronised dynamics of a population of cardiac cells .",
    "this synchronisation is realised through appropriate designs of cardiac cells and their network architecture of local interactions .",
    "another interesting example is found in amoeboid organisms @xcite , where the rhythmic contraction pattern produces streaming of protoplasm .",
    "synchronisation phenomena have been intensively studied for these biological systems during the last decades by means of mathematical models , in particular coupled phase - oscillator models @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of phase - oscillator models are their tractability and universality .    in the present paper , we take advantage of this tractability and propose a decentralised control principle for material flow networks with transportation delays and setup - times , based on the phase - synchronisation of oscillatory services at the network nodes .",
    "let us consider a material transport network , which is a directed graph with of a set of nodes and links .",
    "material can move between the nodes with a finite velocity .",
    "thus , any element experiences a delay @xmath0 between its departure at one node @xmath1 and its arrival at the next node @xmath2 .",
    "whereas a distinct subset of nodes may act as a source or sink of moving material , we shall concentrate on those nodes where the flow of material is conserved , i.e. @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the average rate of incoming and outgoing material , respectively .",
    "each node has to organise the routing of materials arriving through incoming links towards its outgoing links .",
    "all allowed connections between incoming and outgoing links can be described through discrete states of the respective node .",
    "as long as such a state is ` active ' , material can flow from a subset of incoming links through the node and leave through outgoing links .",
    "all other flow relations are blocked .",
    "usually the switching between different discrete states needs a certain time interval @xmath6 , called switching- or setup - time .",
    "depending on the flow rates , the duration of these discrete states may vary .",
    "since we assume a cyclic service sequence , we can assign a periodic motion to every switching node .",
    "thus , a node can be modelled as a hybrid system consisting of a phase - oscillator and a piecewise constant function @xmath7 that maps the continuous phase - angle @xmath8 to the discrete service state @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath10 .",
    "+ the switched service of different flows leads to convoy formation processes .",
    "this implies highly correlated arrivals at subsequent nodes , which requires to optimise @xmath7 with respect to a minimal delay of the material . whereas the map @xmath7 can be optimised according to the actual local demand ,",
    "the phase - angle @xmath11 is coupled to the oscillatory system of the neighbouring nodes .",
    "thus , with a suitable synchronisation mechanism we can achieve a coordination of the switching states on a network - wide level . in consequence , we suggest an adaptive decentralised control concept consisting of two parts :    1 .",
    "phase - synchronisation of all oscillators in the network , based on local coupling between immediate neighbours .",
    "2 .   mapping of phase - angles to the switching states based on local optimisation .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , we apply our method to the control of traffic lights at intersections of road networks .",

    "[ sec : traffic ] we show how an optimal switching of green and red traffic light phases with respect to minimum delay times can be reached , based on local adjustment and optimisation .",
    "in the following , we introduce a hybrid oscillator model for a single traffic light controlled intersection and derive an upper bound for the allowed oscillator frequency .      an intersection in road traffic",
    "is given by a set of traffic lights @xmath12 , each one controlling the vehicular flow of a single or several lanes . if two driving paths intersect , we call the related green lights conflicting .",
    "we require that conflicting traffic lights are not set to green at the same time . in order to increase the throughput of an intersection",
    ", non - conflicting traffic lights can be switched collectively .",

    "otherwise , the possible dynamics of the coupled system is restricted by an intersection @xmath65 , whose maximum frequency is reached .",
    "this requires the remaining oscillators to be _ frequency - locked _ to @xmath66 .",
    "[ fig : synchro - states ] shows an example of both dynamical regimes which are discussed in the following .",

    "the time needed by a vehicle to traverse a series of roads controlled by traffic lights is given by the travel times between the intersections and the delay times at red lights . to minimise the overall travel time , or , to increase the throughput of the controlled network",
    ", we shall minimise the delay times at every intersection . according to the synchronisation concept outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : synchro ] , each intersection @xmath1 is provided with a phase - angle @xmath53 , phase - locked to its neighbours and synchronised to a common frequency @xmath26 . due to frequency synchronisation in steady state ,",

    "each intersection @xmath1 may now independently adjust its switching sequence @xmath10 based on the local arrivals of the vehicles .",

    "+ we shall answer the question , where in the cycle the state @xmath15 should start , to minimise the total time that all vehicles may need to pass the intersection .",
    "therefore , by @xmath23 we denote the point where the subset @xmath88 of traffic lights switches to red after a green time period @xmath22 .",
    "+ the delay of a single vehicle is given by the period between its arrival @xmath89 and its departure @xmath90 .",
    "a vehicle may arrive at the point @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",

    "+ to identify the optimum value of @xmath23 and @xmath22 for all @xmath13 we consider the following two assumptions : + ( i ) the sequence of states is given , e.g. by the order of their indices @xmath99 .",
    "+ ( ii ) the periods @xmath22 are fixed and fulfil the conditions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cycle ] ) and ( [ eq : queuestability ] ) .",

    "fig : cycle ] ) .",
    "thus , the end - point @xmath23 of each state @xmath15 becomes a function of @xmath18 : @xmath101 inserting eq .",

    "the start - phase @xmath18 can be shifted to the optimal value @xmath104 by an offset to the input argument of the map , e.g. @xmath106 . by adjusting the start - phases , a mutual adaption of the start times of green - phases at neighbouring intersections",
    "is reached .",
    "this will ensure a minimum delay for all vehicles which have to pass the intersection .",
    "once the optimum @xmath107 is reached for two intersections , the switching sequence is repeated periodically until the traffic situation changes and a new optimum is obtained by the control concept outlined above . under certain circumstances , it results in emergent green waves .",
    "in this paper we have developed a method to reach coordination among the traffic lights of an urban street network .",
    "this method is based on a combination of a synchronisation resulting from local interactions and a pure local optimisation :    1 .   at each intersection",
    ", the maximum frequency is determined that allows one to clear the queues on the incoming road sections within one switching cycle .",
    "this frequency is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegamax ] ) in dependence of the respective road utilisation .",
    "the signal controls of all intersections are eventually adjusted to the minimum of all these frequencies , based on a coupling of neighbouring signals .",
    "a decentralised method of adjustment is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasesync ] ) .",
    "+ thereby , all intersections of the road network continuously equalise the period of their switching cycles .",
    "thus , the switching sequences and the arrivals rates of the vehicles at all intersections become periodic functions . 3 .",
    "it is always tried to increase this frequency in order to reduce the waiting times of vehicles in queues .",
    "this is reached by introducing a constant drift , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : frequsync ] ) .",
    "each cycle is subdivided into different green - phases and setup - times as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . note that , within one switching cycle , some roads may be served several times .",
    "the optimal green - phases are obtained by minimising the objective function ( [ eq : delaycost ] ) .",
    "if a periodic sequence of green lights is used , the optimisation problem becomes a minimisation of a continuous function with a single parameter @xmath18 . in order to minimise the waiting times of vehicles during red light , the model presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : traffic ] determines the optimal start - phase @xmath104 of the switching sequence for each intersection .    under suitable conditions ,",
    "our concept allows for the emergence of green waves .",
    "let s consider the example of a single main road with several intersections and different average flow rates in both directions .",
    "then , the vehicles belonging to the highest traffic flow will always have a green light except for the very first traffic light where the vehicles queued are bundled .",
    "the green wave will propagate with the largest group of vehicles .",
    "although our method is quite promising , it has also some limitations : first , the method for determining the maximum frequencies @xmath47 needs to be extended for practical application : in real traffic networks , it is possible that the traffic arriving at an intersection exceeds capacity . in this case , it is not possible to remove all waiting vehicles within one cycle . within the framework outlined above",
    ", the intersection would be just blocked . however , this situation can be easily avoided by defining a global minimum of the allowed switching frequencies . if the overload situation occurs temporarily , such a minimum frequency will still guarantee a stable functioning of the concept , but it can not avoid queues that persist for more than one switching cycle . furthermore , to dissolve existing queues quickly and to increase the robustness with respect to stochastic variations in the average flow rates , the maximum frequencies could be assigned a smaller value than determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegamax ] ) .",
    "+ second , the frequency of the synchronised system is likely to decrease with growing system size , so that waiting times can become quite long .",
    "therefore , synchronisation can not be the only goal in signal control .",
    "instead , it would make sense to break up a large synchronised system into smaller synchronised clusters , which may change their shape and size in the course of time .",
    "it would also be reasonable to change the order of green - phases sometimes in response to different traffic patterns ( e.g. inbound or outbound traffic during the morning and afternoon rush hours , respectively ) .    nevertheless , it is useful to have a method for a self - organised coordination of traffic or material flows in a network , based on local interactions",
    ". the next step will be to couple this approach with a concrete simulation of the dynamics of material flows and queue formation in the system , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the optimal switching of traffic lights in non - trivial road networks is one of the most complex material flow control problems .",
    "however , the problem in most material flow networks is similar . in production and manufacturing : road sections in traffic correspond to buffers in production , travel and delay times to cycle or production times , junctions to processing units , and different origin - destination flows in road networks to different product flows .",
    "thus , our approach is easily transferable to the control of production systems or other material flow networks .",
    "it is particularly suited for systems of moderate size and load , which applies to many manufacturing systems .",
