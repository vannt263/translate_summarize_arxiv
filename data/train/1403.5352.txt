    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques represent a family of ground - breaking advances in wireless communications during the past two decades . this is because they are capable of providing more degrees of freedom to significantly improve the system s data rate and link reliability @xcite .",
    "recently , the massive mimo , which is also known as the large - scale mimo , has been attracting increasing attentions owing to its unprecedented potential of high spectral efficiency @xcite-@xcite . in massive mimo systems ,",
    "the base station ( bs ) is equipped with a hundred or a few hundred antennas , and serves tens of user terminals ( uts ) simultaneously .",
    "when the angular spreads are not wide enough , the performance of these systems will degrade significantly , and hence a beamforming approach is proposed for achieving directional antenna gain @xcite .",
    "additionally , instead of the one - dimensional linear array , the antenna arrays of the massive mimo systems are expected to be implemented in more than one dimension because of the constraint concerning the array aperture .",
    "consequently , the beamforming may be required to operate in two dimensions which correspond to the azimuth and elevation directions @xcite , some examples include the three - dimensional beamforming approaches of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the performance of the beamforming - based systems closely relies on the accuracy of the estimated angular parameters , i.e. , the location parameters .",
    "for example , @xmath0 and @xmath1 estimation errors cause 20 db and 3 db reductions of the output signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , respectively @xcite , @xcite , and the influence of estimation error becomes significant when the number of the antennas increases @xcite . therefore , as opposed to the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) localization problem where only the azimuth angular parameters need to be estimated , in this paper we focus on the problem of two - dimensional ( 2-d ) localization of distributed sources in the context of the massive mimo systems , where both the azimuth and elevation angular parameters have to be estimated .",
    "the localization of point sources , i.e. , the direction - of - arrival ( doa ) estimation , has been of interest to the signal processing community for decades @xcite .",
    "when the signal of each source emits from a single doa and the doas of all the sources can be distinguished , the sources are assumed to be point sources , and this case corresponds to the line - of - sight transmission scenario @xcite .",
    "when the signal of each source emits from an angular region , the sources are assumed to be distributed sources , and this case corresponds to the multipath transmission scenario @xcite .",
    "obviously , the distributed sources model is more appropriate for cellular wireless systems , where signals are usually transmitted via multipath .",
    "the distributed sources can be categorized into coherently distributed ( cd ) sources and incoherently distributed ( i d ) sources @xcite , which are valid for slowly time - varying channels and rapidly time - varying channels , respectively . in cellular mobile communication systems ,",
    "rapidly time - varying channels are typically more appropriate to characterize the realistic circumstances .",
    "additionally , the classical localization approaches for point sources have been successfully generalized to the scenario of the cd sources @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the researches on the localization of the i d sources are less adequate @xcite-@xcite . for example , @xcite is entirely limited to the 1-d localization scenario , @xcite is only suitable for the single - source localization , and the performance of @xcite depends on the accuracy of the initial estimates of location parameters .",
    "therefore , the localization of the i d sources needs to be investigated more extensively .",
    "furthermore , the localization approaches for i d sources can be categorized into parametric approaches and non - parametric approaches .",
    "the non - parametric approaches , such as the beamforming approach and the capon spectrum approach in @xcite , are shown to perform worse than the parametric ones .",
    "hence , we concentrate on the parametric approaches for i d sources in this paper .    although most of the traditional parametric approaches are proposed for 1-d localization of the i d sources , some of them can be extended to the 2-d scenario . among the existing approaches for 2-d localization of",
    "the i d sources , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator of @xcite is optimal , while the approximate ml estimator of @xcite exhibits suboptimal performance with lower complexity .",
    "however , in these ml - based estimators , the 2-d nominal doas and angular spreads of all the uts are estimated by searching exhaustively over the feasible field .",
    "the prohibitive complexity makes these estimators infeasible in large - scale systems .",
    "another approximate ml estimator reduces the searching dimension by using the simplified signal model proposed in @xcite , but this estimator is limited to the single - source assumption @xcite . for the sake of reducing the computational complexity , the least - squares ( ls ) criterion",
    "based estimators are proposed by using the covariance matrix matching technique in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these estimators are either restricted to the single - source case @xcite-@xcite or too complicated due to the same search dimension as faced by the approximate ml estimator @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the subspace based approaches and the beamforming approaches for localization are of reduced complexity compared with the ml - based approaches and the ls - based approaches , though they are less attractive in performance .",
    "similar to the philosophy of the multiple signal classification method @xcite , in the subspace based approaches , the signal parameters are estimated by exploiting the fact that the columns of the noise - free covariance matrix of the received signals are orthogonal to those of the pseudonoise subspace @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "additionally , by employing the minimum variance distortionless response beamforming for localization of the i d sources , the generalized capon estimator is derived @xcite . in these approaches , although the 2-d nominal doas and angular spreads of only a single ut need to be estimated by searching , their complexity is still very high .",
    "the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique ( esprit ) @xcite-@xcite is also a subspace based approach , and has been employed for the 1-d localization of the i d sources in @xcite .",
    "however , the method proposed in @xcite can not be extended to 2-d localization owing to the mutual coupling of the 2-d angular parameters .",
    "another esprit based approach @xcite decouples the estimation of the 2-d nominal doas by changing the projection of the incident signals .",
    "however , in @xcite the nominal azimuth doa still has to be estimated with searching , and the estimation of the angular spreads is not considered .",
    "in addition , the approaches proposed in @xcite , @xcite depend on the assumption that the distance between adjacent antennas is much shorter than the wavelength .    in this paper , an esprit - based approach",
    "is proposed for 2-d localization of multiple i d sources in the massive mimo systems employing very large uniform rectangular arrays ( uras ) .",
    "we reveal that the array response matrix is linearly related to the signal subspace . after dividing the ura into three subarrays , the array response matrices of the three subarrays",
    "are also shown to be linearly related with each other . relying on these linear relations ,",
    "the 2-d nominal doas and angular spreads are estimated by the signal subspace . to be more specific ,",
    "the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows .     )     as opposed to that of the existing works @xcite , @xcite , the distance between adjacent antennas is not constrained .",
    "in addition , the 2-d angular parameters are decoupled by the proposed algorithm and estimated without searching .",
    "these two issues have not been investigated in the existing esprit - based approaches , and the latter is particularly crucial to 2-d localization .",
    "the impact of the number of the bs antennas on the performance of the proposed approach is analyzed in the context of the massive mimo systems .",
    "it is proved that the estimated signal subspace tends to be in the same subspace as the array response matrix when the number of the bs antennas increases .",
    "therefore , the estimation performance improves when the number of the bs antennas increases , which is particularly beneficial for the massive mimo systems .",
    "the approximate cramr - rao bound ( crb ) for the estimation of the 2-d angular parameters is derived , whereas the known crb is only valid for the estimation of the 1-d angular parameters .",
    "it is shown that the proposed approach is of significantly lower complexity than both the ls based covariance matching approaches and the subspace based approaches .",
    "this is because the proposed estimator has closed - form expressions .",
    "this advantage is particularly attractive in the massive mimo systems , because the potentially prohibitive computational complexity is one of the major challenges faced by the massive mimo systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section ii , the system model and the major assumptions are given . in section iii , we present the proposed esprit - based approach . in section iv ,",
    "the analysis of the proposed approach is provided .",
    "more specifically , the impact of the number of the bs antennas on the performance is analyzed , and the approximate crb for the 2-d estimation is derived .",
    "in addition , the computational complexity of the proposed approach is compared with that of other well - known approaches .",

    "we emphasize that the task of localization is to estimate the 2-d nominal doas , @xmath54 and the 2-d angular spreads , @xmath55 , with the aid of the received signal snapshots , @xmath56 . because the signals of the @xmath28 uts are transmitted at the same frequency band and the same time , the received snapshot signals from one ut",

    "+ 7 ) the number of multipaths @xmath67 , is large .    with these assumptions and using the central limit theorem ,",
    "it can be verified that the received signal vector @xmath68 in ( [ xt ] ) is a zero - mean circularly symmetric complex - valued gaussian vector @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the existing subspace based and covariance matching approaches are complicated for the 2-d localization in the massive mimo systems due to the exhausted multidimensional search for estimating the angular parameters . although the traditional 1-d esprit - based approach avoids searching over the parameter space @xcite , the angular parameters are mutually coupled when this approach is employed in the 2-d localization straightforwardly .",
    "the existing 2-d esprit - based approach decouples the angular parameters , but the azimuth nominal doa is still estimated with searching , and the angular spreads are not estimated @xcite .",
    "hence , in this section , the expression of the signal subspace is first derived , which is the foundation of the esprit - based approaches .",
    "then , the signal subspace based esprit approach is proposed for estimating the 2-d angular parameters without searching .",
    "it can be seen that the array manifold @xmath40 in ( [ manifold ] ) is a function of the azimuth and elevation doas . with the first order taylor series expansion of @xmath40 around the nominal doas , @xmath69",
    ", it can be approximated as @xmath70 where the remainder of the series is omitted .",
    "it is assumed that the standard deviations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are sufficiently small .",

    "we can see that @xmath79 is only determined by the nominal doas , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , these nominal doas might be obtained from @xmath79 .",
    "based on the properties of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath34 , and @xmath29 that are given in ( [ sigmatheta ] ) , ( [ sigmaphi ] ) , ( [ sigmagamma ] ) , and ( [ sigmas ] ) , respectively , and the assumption that the transmitted signals , the path gains , and the angular deviations are uncorrelated from each other , the variances of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are obtained as @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "additionally , the covariance is @xmath86 therefore , the covariance matrix of @xmath87 is @xmath88 which is a diagonal matrix with @xmath89_{k , k}=s_k\\sigma_{\\gamma_k}^2 $ ] , @xmath89_{k+k , k+k}=[\\mathbf{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{c}}]_{k , k}\\sigma_{\\theta_k}^2 $ ] , @xmath89_{2k+k,2k+k}=[\\mathbf{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{c}}]_{k , k}\\sigma_{\\phi_k}^2 $ ] , @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the angular spreads , @xmath90 , can be obtained from @xmath91 .    from ( [ xtt ] )",
    ", we can see that @xmath79 and @xmath91 might be obtained from the covariance matrix of @xmath68 .",
    "since the signal and the noise are uncorrelated from each other , and satisfy ( [ covnt ] ) and ( [ lambdasdef ] ) , the covariance matrix of the received signal @xmath68 given by ( [ xtt ] ) is thus expressed as @xmath92 it can be seen that @xmath93 is a normal matrix , i.e. , @xmath94 . because @xmath95 is positive semi - definite and @xmath96 , @xmath93 is positive definite .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue - decomposition ( evd ) of @xmath93 is also the singular value decomposition of @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath97 be a full rank matrix .",
    "then , the largest @xmath98 eigenvalues of @xmath93 are larger than @xmath99 , and the other @xmath100 eigenvalues of @xmath93 approximately equal @xmath99 . in the next section",
    ", we will prove that for the massive mimo systems @xmath97 is indeed a full rank matrix .",
    "hence , the evd of @xmath93 can be written as @xmath101 \\left[\\begin{array}{ll } { \\mathbf{\\sigma}}_{\\mathrm{s } } & \\mathbf{0}_{3k\\times(m-3k)}\\\\ \\mathbf{0}_{(m-3k)\\times 3k } & \\sigma_{\\mathrm{n}}^2\\mathbf{i}_{m-3k } \\end{array } \\right ] [ { \\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{s } } , { \\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{n}}]^h\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{rxx } & \\mspace{-10mu}=\\mspace{-10mu}&{\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}_{\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{s}}^h+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{n}}^2{\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{n}}{\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{n}}^h,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are composed of the eigenvectors of @xmath93 , and @xmath104 is a diagonal matrix comprising the largest @xmath98 eigenvalues of @xmath93 .",

    "then , from ( [ rx ] ) and ( [ imas1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath110 it is known that the diagonal elements of @xmath111 are larger than @xmath99 , which means @xmath112 has full rank .",
    "hence , according to the definition of subspace , @xmath113 and @xmath97 are approximately in the same subspace , i.e. , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a full rank matrix .",
    "additionally , @xmath113 and @xmath116 are termed as the signal subspace and the noise subspace , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the signal subspace can be obtained from the received signal snapshots @xmath56 , and @xmath97 is linearly related to the signal subspace .",
    "hence , the linear relation in ( [ be ] ) will be used for estimating the nominal doas , and the estimation approach will be given in the next subsection .",
    "similar to the practice in the general esprit methods , the antenna array is divided into several subarrays in the proposed estimator as well .",
    "then , the linear relations between the array response matrices of the subarrays can be tactfully constructed for estimating angular parameters . for the estimation of both the elevation and azimuth nominal doas , which are coupled in the array manifold",
    ", the array has to be divided into at least three subarrays to decouple the 2-d nominal doas .",
    "this is because obtaining the 2-d nominal doas needs at least two different functions of them , which can only be derived from at least two different linear relations between the subarrays , and at least three subarrays are needed to obtain the two linear relations .",
    "although the ura can be divided into more than three subarrays , the computational complexity of estimation increases when the number of the subarrays increases , which constitutes one of the main challenges in the context of the massive mimo systems .",
    "in addition , only one antenna is not used with the three - subarray division , which is rather small in comparison with the total number of antennas @xmath66 .",

    "<S> in this paper , an approach of estimating signal parameters via rotational invariance technique ( esprit ) is proposed for two - dimensional ( 2-d ) localization of incoherently distributed ( i d ) sources in large - scale / massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional esprit - based methods are valid only for one - dimensional ( 1-d ) localization of the i d sources . by contrast , in the proposed approach the signal subspace is constructed for estimating the nominal azimuth and elevation direction - of - arrivals and the angular spreads . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed estimator enjoys closed - form expressions and hence it bypasses the searching over the entire feasible field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it imposes significantly lower computational complexity than the conventional 2-d estimation approaches . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the estimation performance of the proposed approach improves when the large - scale / massive mimo systems are employed . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate cramr - rao bound of the proposed estimator for the 2-d localization is also derived . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results demonstrate that albeit the proposed estimation method is comparable with the traditional 2-d estimators in terms of performance , it benefits from a remarkably lower computational complexity .    </S>",
