    "the present observations of the distant supernovae type ia indicate that the universe is presently accelerating @xcite due to the presence of some unknown form of energy violating the strong energy condition @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are energy density and pressure of dark energy , respectively .",
    "while the different candidates for dark energy were proposed @xcite and confronted with observations , the cosmological constant @xmath0 and phantom fields @xcite violating the weak energy condition @xmath4 are most popular .",
    "whereas both the cosmological constant and phantoms fields , described by the barotropic equation of state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , are negligible in the neighborhood of the initial singularity , they dominate late time evolution . in the case of the @xmath0 domination we obtain the de sitter state as a global attractor in the future and for phantom fields",
    "there are a big rip singularity . both the singularities are generic features of their models . in the case of the big rip singularity at the some finite time",
    "the both scale factor and energy density are growing at infinity and the unexpected future singularity of density appears @xcite .",
    "alternatively the universe evolved from the planck region where quantum gravity effects would have dominate . in this context quantum cosmology",
    "is used as a first approximation to the quantum gravity expected effects . recently",
    "the proposal of quantum loop cosmology offers possibility of avoiding an initial singularity @xcite . for completeness",
    "we also consider the brane model @xcite and the models with dynamical dark energy satisfying the dynamical equation of state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is linearized around @xmath9 ( the present epoch ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider four different prototypes of dynamical behavior which take place in the neighborhood of the initial and final singularities .",
    "they give rise the seven representative scenarios , namely , the cdm model with @xmath0 ( @xmath0cdm ) , the cdm model with topological defect ( tdcdm ) , the phantom cdm model ( phcdm ) , the bouncing @xmath0cdm model ( b@xmath0cdm ) , the bouncing phantom cdm model ( bphcdm ) , the brane @xmath0cdm model in randall sundrum version ( br@xmath0cdm ) , and the model with the dynamical equation of state parameter linearized around the present epoch ( deqs ) .",
    "they are completed in table  [ tab:1 ] , where the dependence of the hubble function on redshift @xmath10 is given together with a number of models parameters .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for deeper statistical analysis we use the akaike @xcite and bayesian information criteria @xcite .",
    "it is crucial for our investigations to ask how well different theoretical models fits the same data set @xcite . because from the theoretical investigation arising a large number of candidates for dark energy description it is necessary to select the essential model parameters from the considered set of parameters of the most general model .",
    "the akaike information criterion ( aic ) is defined in the following way @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the maximum likelihood and @xmath13 is the number of the model parameters .",
    "the best model with a parameter set providing the preferred fit to the data is that minimizes the aic .",
    "the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) introduced by schwarz @xcite is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of data points used in the fit .",
    "the effectiveness of using this criteria in the current cosmological applications has been recently demonstrated by liddle @xcite .",
    "taking cmb wmap data @xcite and applying the information criteria , liddle @xcite found the number of essential cosmological parameters to be five .",
    "moreover he obtained the important conclusion that spatially - flat models are statistically preferred to close models as it was indicated by the cmb wmap analysis ( their best - fit value is @xmath16 at @xmath17 level ) .",
    "note that both information criteria have no absolute sense and only the relative value between differential models are physically interesting .",
    "for the bic a difference of @xmath18 is treated as a positive evidence ( @xmath19 as a strong evidence ) against the model with larger value of bic @xcite .",
    "the results of calculation aic and bic in the context of dark energy models are presented in table  [ tab:2 ] and table  [ tab:3 ] . in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] we show results for all models considerated for both flat and non flat cases without any assumed extra priors . in the general case",
    "the number of essential parameters in the cosmological models with dark energy is in principal two , i.e. , ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "it mean that flat model is favored in the light of the information criteria .",
    "we can observe two rival models which minimizes the aic and bic .",
    "they are the @xmath0cdm model and phantom cdm ( phcdm ) models .",
    "one can observe that both bic and aic values assume greater values for phantom models .",
    "this evidence can be regarded as a positive evidence in favor of the phcdm model .",
    "we can derived one - dimensional probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the models parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we present pdfs for @xmath21 for all three flat models with two free parameters , i.e. , for the flat @xmath0cdm , tdcdm and phcdm models .",
    "there is a significant difference between predictions of these models .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model prefers a universe with @xmath21 close to @xmath22 , the phcdm model favors a high density universe while the tdcdm model favors a low density universe . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present values of the aic and bic for these models . if @xmath23 then the information criteria favor the tdcdm model . for @xmath24 , the @xmath0cdm is favored while for @xmath25 the phcdm model is preferred .",
    "the similar analysis with the use of the information criteria is done in the case of the assumed prior @xmath26 @xcite ( table  [ tab:3 ] ) . in this",
    "case models with @xmath0 is preferred over the models with phantoms , that is in contrary to the results obtained in the previous case of no priors for @xmath21 .",
    "it clearly shows that more precise measurements of @xmath21 will give us the possibility to discriminate between the @xmath0cdm and phcdm models .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to decide which model with dark energy is distinguish by statistical analysis of snia data . to do this we use the akaike and bayesian information criteria .",
    "the former criterion weighs in favor of the flat phantom model while the latter distinguishes the flat phantom and @xmath0cdm models . assuming the prior @xmath26 both aic and bic criteria weighs in favor of the flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it was considered the seven different models containing dark energy and dust matter ( baryonic and dark matter ) .",
    "our main result is that spatially flat phantom model is favored to @xmath0cdm model by information criteria of aic and bic .",
    "the further conclusions are the following .    *",
    "the minimal number of essential parameters in the cosmological models with dark energy is in principal two , i.e. , ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the list of essential parameters may be longer , because some of them are not convincingly measured with present data , like the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "* the curvature density parameter does not belong to the class of essential parameters when all the rest parameters are without any priors ( with no fixed @xmath21 ) . at this point",
    "our result coincides with analogous result obtained by liddle who found it basing on other observations . *",
    "if we consider models in which all model parameters are fitted then the phcdm model with double initial and final singularities is distinguished .",
    "* when we consider the prior on @xmath21 , then the model with two - dimensional topological defect has @xmath28 , the @xmath0cdm has @xmath29 , and the phantom model @xmath30",
    ".      one can also draw from our analysis some kind of philosophical conclusion . basing on simple and objective information criterion",
    "finally we obtain that snia data favored the models with the initial ( big bang ) and final ( big rip ) singularities .",
    "the big rip singularities are represents generic final future state of universe dominating by phantom dark energy .",
    "the bounce can be caused by high energy quantity modifications to frw equations which make the cosmology nonsingular @xcite .",
    "if the energy density is so large then quantum gravity corrections are important at both the big bang and big rip .",
    "it is interesting that classical theory reveals itself boundness , i.e. , classical singularities which can be distinguished by the information criteria .",
    "the account of quantum effects allows to avoid not only the initial singularity @xcite but also escape from the future singularity @xcite ."
