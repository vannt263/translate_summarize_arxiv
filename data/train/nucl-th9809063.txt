    "the use of scaling and the application of dimensional analysis to cross sections for inclusive scattering of a weakly interacting probe from the constituents of a composite system have been important tools for the development of new insights in physics .",
    "examples for such processes are the scattering of kev electrons from electrons bound in atoms @xcite , the scattering of ev neutrons from atoms in solids or liquids @xcite , deep inelastic scattering of gev energy leptons from the quarks in the nucleon @xcite and , of particular interest for the present letter , quasi - elastic scattering of electrons in the energy range of 100 s of mev to several gev from nucleons in nuclei @xcite . despite the extraordinary range of energy and momentum transfer for which scaling has been studied",
    ", the conceptual basis for describing this phenomenon has many features in common .",
    "the inclusive cross sections for these processes in general depend explicitly on two independent variables  the energy @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 transferred by the probe to the constituent .",
    "_ scaling _ means that , in the asymptotic regime of large @xmath4 and @xmath2 , the cross sections depend on a _ single _",
    "variable @xmath5 , itself a function of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this property results essentially from the kinematics of the scattering process of the probe by the moving constituent , which as a consequence of the recoil momentum received , is ejected essentially quasi - freely from the composite system .",
    "the interest in scaling phenomena originates from two distinct sources :    * the observation of the occurrence ( or nonoccurrence ) of scaling yields information on the domination ( or not ) of the quasi - free scattering process or the contribution of other reaction mechanisms ( which in general do not scale ) .",
    "this provides _ experimental _",
    "insight into the reaction mechanism , knowledge which is a prerequisite for a quantitative understanding of the cross section . * the function to which the data scale is closely related to the momentum distribution of the constituents in the composite target .",
    "this provides interesting experimental knowledge on the dynamics of the bound system .    for quasi - elastic electron - nucleus scattering ,",
    "data are available over a large range of @xmath6 and for several nuclei .",
    "these data have been found to scale in a major part of the kinematical region studied . when analyzed in terms of the scaling variable @xmath7 @xcite , which is close to the component @xmath8 of a bound nucleon s momentum parallel to @xmath3 , the data exhibit scaling for @xmath9 ( roughly @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the nucleon mass , where @xmath12 ) , that is , the region in which quasi - elastic scattering dominates .",
    "much of the past work has concentrated on the study of the scaling properties of the response in the low-@xmath2 tail of the quasi - elastic peak where @xmath7 is large and negative .",
    "detailed quantitative studies of the conditions under which scaling occurs and the impact of adverse effects such as final - state interactions @xcite , the spread of the spectral function @xmath13 in removal energy @xmath14 , and the contributions of other reaction mechanisms have been made . for a review see @xcite .",
    "past applications of scaling focused on individual nuclei and nuclear matter using the data for different kinematics in the range @xmath4 = 0.5  2 gev / c and @xmath2 = 0.1  3 gev . in the present letter",
    ", we explore a novel aspect : rather than concentrating on the response of individual nuclei , we compare the scaling function of _ different nuclei _ with mass number @xmath154 , and study the degree to which these scaling functions are the _",
    "same_. our goal is to explore whether the concept of superscaling , introduced in @xcite within the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model , works for finite nuclei . for these studies we concentrate on the main part of the quasi - elastic peak where superscaling could , if anyplace , be hoped to work .",
    "discussions of scaling at intermediate energies assume that inclusive electron scattering in the quasi - elastic regime has as a dominant process the impulsive one - body knockout of nucleons together with contributions from two - body meson exchange current ( mec ) and meson production processes that may play a role when the normally dominant process is suppressed .",
    "in addition to the electron scattering angle @xmath16 , one has two variables to characterize the cross section , typically chosen to be @xmath6 . of course , any function @xmath17 of @xmath4 and @xmath2 may be used together with @xmath4 to characterize the cross section . for over two decades",
    "it has been traditional to use the so - called @xmath7-scaling variable for @xmath18 ( for a review of the history of the subject , the basic formalism and reference to many of the theoretical studies undertaken see @xcite ) . upon dividing the inclusive electron scattering cross section by the single - nucleon electromagnetic cross section together with the jacobian required in changing variables to @xmath7",
    "one obtains a derived function @xmath19 . scaling means that at high enough values of momentum transfer this function becomes a function only of @xmath7 , that is , independent of @xmath4 : @xmath20",
    "indeed , it has been found that in the @xmath9 region ( the region of the low-@xmath2 side of the quasi - elastic peak ) for momentum transfers of roughly 0.5 gev / c or larger @xmath7-scaling is very well obeyed . for more detailed discussion of this approach and for a summary of the experimental situation , see @xcite .    as an alternative to this standard plane - wave impulse approximation approach",
    "scaling can be examined from a different point of view using as a starting point the rfg model @xcite .",
    "this model has the appeal of simplicity while maintaining important aspects in the problem such as lorentz covariance and gauge invariance .",
    "naturally it ignores potentially important effects such as those stemming from strong final - state interactions or two - body mec and employs an overly simplified initial - state spectral function ; nevertheless , such ingredients can be added to the basic model and appear not to invalidate it as a basic starting point for analyses of scaling .    below we summarize the essential rfg developments and refer the reader to @xcite for more detail , including the relationships between the rfg formalism and the usual @xmath7-scaling analysis . as seen in the work cited ,",
    "a dimensionless scaling variable @xmath21 naturally emerges : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dimensionless fermi kinetic energy and momentum , respectively . here",
    "we employ dimensionless variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "additionally , to allow for the fact that nucleons are knocked out of all shells in the nucleus we follow the spirit of @xcite and introduce an `` average removal energy '' by shifting @xmath2 to @xmath28 and hence defining a derived variable @xmath29 by substituting @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) .",
    "in fact , in the present work we simply adjust @xmath34 to fit the systematic trend seen in the data , rather than employing the specific shift discussed in @xcite ; however , since typically @xmath2 is large for the kinematics considered below , while the chosen values of @xmath34 are small , ranging from about 15 to 25 mev in our analysis , the actual values chosen are not critical .    weighting the squares of the single - nucleon form factors with the appropriate proton and neutron numbers , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 within the rfg model",
    "it is then natural to define a function @xmath38 }   \\label{ftotal}\\ ] ] where terms of order @xmath39 have been ignored here since @xmath40 is typically small , growing from 0.06 for deuterium to about 0.3 for the heaviest nuclei ( full expressions are given in @xcite ) . here @xmath41 is the mott cross section and @xmath42 the familiar rosenbluth kinematical factors . in terms of the rfg variables scaling",
    "means that at high @xmath4 ( large @xmath43 ) one finds that @xmath44 becomes only a function of @xmath29  indeed , if @xmath34 is set to zero , then the rfg scales ( in @xmath21 ) exactly , as it must , since this provided the original definition of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "while the rfg approach discussed here and the usual @xmath7-scaling analysis have differences in detail , they are rather closely related under `` typical '' circumstances , namely , for momentum transfers that are relatively large ( say @xmath45 0.5 gev / c ) , for energy transfers that are not too close to threshold ( where both approaches are bound to fail ) and for nuclei that are not too light ( since the rfg approach can not account for daughter nucleus recoil effects ) . roughly speaking the @xmath29 variable can be regarded as an alternative to @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "can be equated with @xmath48 .",
    "one finds that scaling in @xmath29 and @xmath7 is very similar ( this is discussed in more detail in a longer accompanying paper @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    "the idea of `` superscaling '' was introduced , but until now not tested with existing high - quality data on quasi - elastic scattering .",
    "the observation to be drawn from the rfg developments summarized above is that , within the context of that model , plotting @xmath49 versus @xmath21 leads to a universal curve , namely , not only universal in that no @xmath43-dependence remains , but also that the result _ is independent of the choice of nucleus _ modulo minor corrections of order @xmath39 .",
    "this suggests attempting the same type of representation of the experimental data to investigate the idea of superscaling , which we proceed to do in the following section .",
    "we next use the inclusive electron - nucleus scattering data in order to test the idea of superscaling .",
    "we also try to disentangle better the various reasons that underlie the well - known fact that at large electron energy loss nonscaling is observed . for these studies we basically concentrate on nuclei with @xmath50 , as the lightest nuclei are known to have momentum distributions that are very far from the `` universal '' one which is at the basis of the superscaling idea .",
    "data on inclusive electron - nucleus scattering for a series of nuclei @xmath51 are available in the region of low momentum transfers @xmath52 0.5 gev / c @xcite  @xcite , while data extending to much higher @xmath4 are available from other experiments @xcite @xcite .",
    "not all of these data can be used , however , as some of them have not been corrected for radiative and coulomb distortion effects , are known to have problems such as `` snout scattering '' or the inclusion of false signals from @xmath53 s in the electron spectrometer , or are only available in the form of figures .",
    "part of the data is at very low momentum transfer , which we do not consider as there scaling is known to break down due to large final - state interactions and pauli blocking effects .    in a first step ,",
    "we have taken the data that meet our criteria for the nuclei @xmath54 and have analyzed them in terms of scaling in the variable @xmath29 .",
    "as @xmath29 is defined in terms of the fermi momentum , appropriate values of @xmath55 had to be selected .",
    "we use 220 , 230 , 235 and 240 mev / c for c , al , fe , au , with intermediate values for the intermediate nuclei .    figure  [ di421 ] shows the scaling function @xmath56 for all kinematics ( energies , angles , momentum transfers ) suitable for the present study and all @xmath57 available .",
    "we clearly observe a scaling behavior for values of @xmath1 : while the cross sections at a given @xmath29 vary over more than three orders of magnitude , the values of @xmath0 are essentially universal . for @xmath58 ,",
    "on the other hand , the scaling property is badly violated , and this is to be expected , as there processes other than quasi - elastic scattering  meson exchange currents , @xmath59-excitation , deep inelastic scattering ",
    "contribute to the cross section .",
    "the scaling as discussed in this paper applies only to processes having the kinematics of electron - nucleon quasi - free scattering .    in order to separate some of the effects leading to less - than - perfect scaling at negative @xmath29 , in fig .",
    "[ di321 ] we show the function @xmath60 for the series of nuclei @xmath61 , but for fixed kinematics ( electron energy 3.6 gev , scattering angle 16@xmath62 , and hence nearly constant @xmath4 ) .",
    "the quality of the scaling in the region @xmath63 is quite amazing .",
    "this shows that , insofar as the removal of the @xmath57-dependence goes , the superscaling works extremely well .",
    "the deviations from scaling observed in fig .  [ di421 ] are _ not _ from an @xmath57-dependence .    a part of the @xmath57-dependent increase of @xmath56 at positive @xmath29 results from the increase of @xmath55 with @xmath57 .",
    "this amounts to an increase of the width of the quasi - elastic and @xmath59 peaks , and a correspondingly increased overlap with non  quasi - free scattering processes ( @xmath59-excitation , @xmath64-production , @xmath65 ) . at the same time",
    ", the increasing average density of the heavier nuclei may also lead to an increase in contributions of two - body mec processes which are presumably strongly density - dependent ( i.e. , do not scale with @xmath55 in the same way the one - body knockout processes do ; see @xcite for indications of this type of behavior ) .",
    "figure [ di422 ] shows the data for @xmath66 4 , 12 , 27 , 56 , 197 on a logarithmic scale for the kinematics of fig .  [ di321 ] .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the scaling property extends to large negative values of @xmath29 , values which correspond to large momenta of the initial nucleon .",
    "a priori , this feature is not predicted within the rfg model used to motivate the choice of @xmath29 .",
    "it can be understood , however , from the theoretical results for the momentum distribution of nuclear matter as a function of the nuclear matter density . for different nuclear matter densities ,",
    "the tail of the momentum distribution @xmath67 at @xmath68 ( corresponding to @xmath69 ) is a near - universal function of @xmath70 @xcite . for finite nuclei and large momenta we can employ the local density approximation ( lda ) , as at large @xmath71",
    "we are dealing with short - range properties of the nuclear wave function @xcite .",
    "within lda , the nuclear momentum distribution ( spectral function ) then is a weighted average over the corresponding nuclear matter distributions .",
    "this means that the large - momentum tail of the nuclear momentum distribution also scales with @xmath55 , a dependence that is removed when using @xmath29 .    in order to emphasize the quality of this superscaling in the tail , in fig .",
    "[ di422 ] we have also included the data on @xmath72he , taken under the same kinematical conditions @xcite . while at @xmath73=0 @xmath0 for @xmath72he is about 10% higher than for heavier nuclei as a consequence of the sharper peak of the momentum distribution @xmath67 at @xmath74 , the scaling function for @xmath72he agrees perfectly with the one for heavier nuclei for @xmath75 .    a similar quality of superscaling",
    "is found when analyzing the data at the other kinematics at both higher and lower @xmath4 where cross sections for a large range of @xmath57 are available . as an example , fig .",
    "[ di47 ] shows the scaling function for the data at 3.6 gev and 25@xmath62 @xcite    the quality of scaling in terms of the variable @xmath29 is quite similar to the one found when using the standard variable @xmath7 .",
    "we have systematically used @xmath29 defined above as this variable is more directly connected to the rfg model that motivated the study of superscaling .",
    "we have analyzed data on electron - nucleus quasi - elastic scattering for nuclei with mass numbers @xmath57 = 4  208 which cover a large range in @xmath76 .",
    "we find that , upon use of the scaling variable @xmath29 which allows one to remove the `` trivial '' dependence on the fermi momentum , the data on the low-@xmath2 side of the quasi - elastic peak ( @xmath1 ) show superscaling , _",
    "i.e. _ the scaling functions @xmath0 for the different nuclear mass numbers @xmath57 coincide .",
    "the @xmath57-independence of the superscaling function actually is much better realized than the @xmath4-independence of the normal scaling function , which is violated due to processes such as meson exchange currents and/or excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the nucleon .",
    "the realization of superscaling shows that different nuclei , in the integral sense tested via inclusive scattering @xcite , have a more or less universal momentum distribution once the obvious dependence on the fermi momentum @xmath55 is removed .",
