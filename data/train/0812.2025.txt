    "it is well known that in the absence of feedback the majority of baryons in galaxy - size dark matter haloes ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) should have cooled into halo centres over a hubble time ( e.g. white & rees 1978 ; katz 1992 ; benson et al .",
    "in contrast , only @xmath8 of the associated baryons in milky - way size haloes are observed to be in a cold , collapsed form ( maller & bullock 2004 ( mb04 ) ; mo et al .",
    "2005 ; fukugita & peebles 2006 ; nicastro et al .",
    "an understanding of the feedback processes that act to solve this galaxy overcooling problem is a major goal of galaxy formation today .",
    "it is not known if the undiscovered galactic baryons exist primarily in hot gaseous halos around normal galaxies ( mb04 ; fukugita & peebles 2006 ; sommer - larsen 2006 ) or if they have been mostly expelled as a result of energetic blow - out ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; oppenheimer & dav 2006 ) .",
    "there are several reasons to take seriously the possibility that a large fraction of the missing galactic baryons reside in the halos of normal galaxies . in the milky way ,",
    "x - ray absorption lines produced by local hot gas are detected in the spectra of several bright agn ( e.g. , williams et al .",
    ", 2005 ; fang et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "many argue that this absorption corresponds to local gas ( @xmath9 kpc ; e.g. , wang et al . , 2005 ; fang et al .",
    ", 2006 ; bregman & lloyd - davies , 2007 ) , but the true origin of these features , including whether it is associated with a hot component of the milky way disc or with an extended hot halo , remains open to debate .",
    "interestingly , sembach et al . ( 2003 ) and tripp et al . (",
    "2003 ) have argued that high - velocity features observed by fuse highlight the boundaries between hi clouds ( high - velocity clouds , hvcs ) and an extended , hot gaseous corona around the galaxy .",
    "further indirect evidence for a hot galactic halo comes from ram - pressure stripping models the magellanic stream ( e.g. , mastropietro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; kaufmann et al . in preparation ) and the lack of neutral gas in low - luminosity satellite galaxies of the milky way ( grcevich et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the hvcs themselves might be the neutral cores of larger , pressure - supported clouds embedded within this hot gas halo ( mb04 ; collins et al . 2005 ; thom et al . 2006 ; peek et al . 2007 ) .",
    "quasar absorption line studies suggest that normal milky - way - type galaxies at intermediate redshift are surrounded by extended , @xmath10 100 kpc , haloes of cool gas clouds ( @xmath11 k ) with high covering factors ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "less massive galaxies tend to have smaller , less pronounced gaseous haloes ( steidel , 1995 ; chen et al . , 2001 ;",
    "tumlinson & fang , 2005 ; kacprzak et al . , 2008 ; chen & tinker , 2008 ) and the probability that cool halo gas is present may correlate with the color of the galaxy ( barton & cooke in preparation ) . interestingly , however , x - ray observations place tight constraints on the nature of hot gas around nearby disc galaxies .",
    "specifically , it must be of a relatively low density in order to evade x - ray emission bounds ( recent limits include @xmath13 erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 arcmin@xmath16 , pedersen et al . 2006 ; @xmath17 erg s@xmath15 , benson et al .",
    "2000 ; @xmath18 erg s@xmath15 , li et al .",
    "2007 ) . these results , together with the",
    "fairly high covering factors in cool clouds implied by absorption line studies may suggest a picture where normal galaxies are surrounded by extended , low - density hot ( @xmath19 k ) haloes that are filled with fragmented , pressure supported cool ( @xmath20 k ) clouds ( mb04 ; mo & miralda - escude 1996 ) .",
    "independently , models aimed at explaining the optical properties of galaxies have relied increasingly on the idea that extended , quasi - stable hot gas haloes develop around massive galaxies ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere et al . 2005 ; bower et al . 2006 , croton et al . 2006 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ) .",
    "it is suggested that these hot haloes may be quite susceptible to feedback mechanisms , which could stabilise the systems to cooling and help explain the observed bimodality in galaxy properties ( dekel & birnboim 2006 ) .",
    "it is possible that in massive galactic haloes ( a few times @xmath21 m@xmath7 ) gravitational quenching by clumpy ( fragmentary ) accretion could provide the source of energy ( dekel & birnboim 2008 ) .    ]",
    "observational probes of the gaseous haloes of galaxies provide a potential means of testing these ideas .",
    "entropy injected from feedback mechanisms will alter the density distribution of halo gas and affect associated cooling rates ( and thus x - ray emission ) and the distribution of cooling clouds fragmenting within the hot haloes .",
    "similarly , early feedback or _ pre - heating _ before the halo collapses can affect halo gas profiles in a related manner , with positive consequences for galaxy properties at @xmath22 ( mo & mao 2002 ; oh & benson 2003 ; lu & mo 2007 ) .",
    "this type of feedback has the potential for solving many of the major problems in galaxy formation . not only",
    "will it help with overcooling , but it may also result in larger disc galaxies , relieving the so - called angular - momentum problem ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 , maller & dekel 2002 ) . moreover , the x - ray emission in pre - heated haloes is expected to stay within observational bounds ( mo & mao 2002 ) . the degree to which this type of pre - heating may affect the fraction of material accreted directly in the form cold flows that do not shock - heat ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere et al .",
    "2005 ) has yet to be investigated .",

    "+ ( 4 ) total cold gas mass in the halo , excluding the disc .",
    "after @xmath23 gyr of evolution of the high entropy high - resolution run , a variety of cool clouds ( temperature equal to the cut - off temperature in the cooling function , @xmath24 k in most cases ) are found , ranging from compact clouds close to the disc ( with masses @xmath25 and sizes of @xmath26 kpc ) to diffuse clouds in the outer halo ( typical masses of @xmath27 m@xmath28 and larger sizes of @xmath29 kpc ) .",
    "clouds sizes are set by pressure confinement , therefore at fixed mass they are more diffuse at large radius , where the background hot gas pressure is lower . because of the increased hot gas density towards the halo centre , we can resolve lower mass clouds more easily near the disc .",
    "the fate of fragmentary clouds depends on various mechanisms ( see also kaufmann et al . 2006 , mb04 ) .",
    "one of the most important processes that influences cloud survival is the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability . as a cool , dense cloud moves through a hot , tenuous background , the interface between the two phases is subject to the growth of this instability , which can disrupt the clouds . at our resolution",
    ", the standard implementation of sph does not resolve such instabilities due to smoothing and the artificial viscosity which tends to blur any sharp interface between the inner and outer medium ( agertz et al .",
    "2007 ) . for the case",
    "in which self - gravity is unimportant , murray et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derive a characteristic growth time for the instability of @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the relative velocity and @xmath32 is the density of the background medium . the clouds are therefore expected to break up on time - scales comparable to @xmath33 . in their numerical experiments they actually found that the mass loss was still quite small over time scales twice as long as @xmath34 in our simulations the density contrasts range from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , the relative velocities @xmath31 from @xmath9 to @xmath37 km / s and therefore we end up with @xmath33 ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 gyr . based on these estimates ,",
    "the kh instability could dissolve a significant fraction of the clouds with the parameters given above , if they were evolved in isolation .",
    "but vietri et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that with the inclusion of radiative cooling the effect of the kelvin - helmholtz instability are stabilised and clouds in the mass range given above survive .",
    "moreover , vieser & hensler ( 2007 ) showed that the destructive effect of kh instability is significantly slowed if heat conduction is included .",
    "we also note that the thermal instability can be suppressed by buoyant oscillations in a medium with a pressure gradient in thermal equilibrium ( balbus & soker 1989 ) .",
    "however our simulations ( and real gaseous galactic haloes , for that matter ) are not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this suppression is also reduced if convection occurs in the gas .",
    "clearly , the issue of cloud survival remains an important one , especially for questions to do with the manner of gas feeding onto galaxies .",
    "the situation in simulations is more dynamical than accounted for in most analytic explorations of kh : clouds grow by merging and new clouds are born due to the thermal instability . taken the kelvin - helmholtz instability together with conductive evaporation , which can prevent the survival of small clouds ( see mb04 ) , these effects would reduce the total mass in cool halo gas by destroying the smallest clouds and modifying the outer layers of the bigger clouds in our simulations k and self - shielding effects . ] .",
    "interestingly , however , for the problem of over - cooling in galaxy haloes , the disruption of cool clouds back into the hot halo can do nothing but help .    in summary , the cool cloud mass spectrum that feeds disc formation is dependent on a variety of physical processes : hydrodynamical instabilities , conduction and the radiation field ,",
    "none of which are currently resolved in these simulations ( or any other cosmological simulations ) .",
    "the initial cloud mass spectrum is determined by the initial perturbation spectrum , which is difficult to determine from first principles .",
    "encouragingly , however , we find that the total amount of gas that cools into clouds seems to be independent of the initial perturbation spectrum .",
    "the results we have presented on cloud properties can be seen as an upper limit on the total mass of cool clouds as most unresolved processes destroy clouds .",
    "the details of how the clouds would be observed is unfortunately more complicated because it depends on the temperature of the gas in the clouds and the ionizing background .",
    "we studied the cooling flow of gas within equilibrium nfw dark matter haloes , in order to mimic the expected growth of @xmath40 halo galaxies after the cold - flow , rapid accretion period has ended for these systems ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the two simulations contained the same baryonic mass and were identical other than their initial gas density profiles  one with a low central entropy that tracked the nfw density profile of the dark matter , and one with a high central entropy and low - density core in its density profile as might be expected in models with substantial pre - heating feedback .",
    "the simulations show dramatic differences in their subsequent evolution .",
    "the high - entropy gas halo forms a fairly low - mass disc with high angular momentum content , an extend halo cloud distribution , and an extended hot gas halo that produces an x - ray surface brightness consistent with observations .",
    "most of the baryons in this case reside in the hot , quasi - stable gas halo .",
    "in contrast , the low entropy run forms a smaller , but heavier disc quickly , shows no hiin the halo , and has an x - ray luminosity that greatly exceeds observed limits for normal spiral galaxies .",
    "these results have led us to three main conclusions :    * changing the distribution of hot gas around galaxies , as might be expected in some pre - heating feedback schemes , dramatically alters many aspects of the subsequent cooling behaviour , as well as the energy required to stabilise the systems to subsequent cooling ( see also mo & mao 2002 ; oh & benson 2003 ) . these differences are not only manifest in the resultant optical characteristics of the central disc galaxy , but they may be tested via x - ray observations and other non - optical probes of the haloes themselves . * galaxy formation that proceeds via the thermal instability and cloud infall can dramatically affect the properties of the resultant galaxy system . in our high entropy simulations , the resultant disc is not only less massive , but it is larger , with more specific angular momentum than in the low - entropy case .",
    "such behaviour is simply not possible if the cooling occurs mainly near the disc in a central cooling flow .",
    "* it is possible to maintain a high - mass ( @xmath42 ) , low - density , quasi - stable gaseous halo around a milky way size galaxy for a significant fraction of the hubble time without a continuous input of feedback energy .",
    "such an extended halo ( once in place ) is a much better match to observations than low - entropy ( cuspy / high - density ) hot gas haloes that are commonly adopted in first - order analytic explorations .",
    "these simulations show that the large core initial gas density profile without any feedback can produce a galaxy that hardly suffers from many of the classical problems in galaxy formation .",
    "kere et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have seen ( smaller ) cores in the density profiles in some of their cosmological haloes and speculate that they could be produced during the early chaotic , rapid assembly phase of haloes ( without the need of agn heating or other preventive feedback ) .",
    "another possibility , explored by tang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using one - dimensional simulations , is that agn pre - heating is triggered by the initial galaxy collapse itself .",
    "this latter collapse could be associated with the end of the cold - mode phase ( kere et al .",
    "2009 ) or ( perhaps equivalently ) the end of the rapid accretion epoch ( wechsler et al .",
    "as we have shown , once the hot gas density profile is suitably rearranged , it basically shuts down associated hot halo cooling for several gigayears without any further input of energy after that early phase .",
    "tests of these ideas using high resolution numerical simulations in a full cosmological set - up are underway .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed on the ia64 linux cluster at the san diego supercomputer center .",
    "we would like to thank stelios kazantzidis for providing a code to generate isolated dark matter haloes .",
