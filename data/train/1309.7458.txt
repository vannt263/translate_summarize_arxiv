    "the notion of nielsen equivalence goes back to the origins of geometric group theory and the work of jakob nielsen in 1920s @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a group , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is an ordered @xmath2-tuple of elements of @xmath1 , a _ elementary nielsen transformation _ on @xmath9 is one of the following three types of moves :    1 .   for some @xmath10 replace @xmath11 in @xmath9 by @xmath12 .",

    "two @xmath2-tuples @xmath8 and @xmath17 of elements of @xmath1 are called _ nielsen equivalent _ , denoted @xmath18 , if there exists a finite chain of elementary nielsen transformations taking @xmath9 to @xmath19 . since elementary nielsen transformations",
    "are invertible it follows that nielsen equivalence is an equivalence relation on the set @xmath20 of ordered @xmath2-tuples of elements of @xmath1 for every @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a free group of rank @xmath7 with a distinguished free basis @xmath22 .",
    "a classic result of nielsen implies that an @xmath2-tuple @xmath23 of elements of @xmath21 is a free basis of @xmath21 if and only if @xmath24 in @xmath21 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath1 is a group and @xmath25 , then @xmath26 if and only if there exists @xmath27 with @xmath28 such that @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "one can also interpret this fact in terms of the action of @xmath31 on @xmath32 .",
    "after fixing a free basis @xmath22 of @xmath21 we identify @xmath32 with @xmath20 by identifying a homomorphism @xmath33 with the @xmath2-tuple @xmath34 .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath31 on @xmath32 by pre - composition .",
    "then two homomorphisms @xmath35 belong to the same @xmath31-orbit if and only if the corresponding @xmath2-tuples @xmath36 and @xmath37 are nielsen equivalent in @xmath1 .",
    "the definition of nielsen equivalence directly implies that if @xmath38 in @xmath1 then @xmath39 ; that is , if two @xmath2-tuples are nielsen - equivalent then they generate the same subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "recall , that for a finitely generated group @xmath1 the _ rank _ of @xmath1 , denote by @xmath40 , is the smallest cardinality of a generating set for @xmath1 . if @xmath41 , an @xmath2-tuple @xmath42 is called _ generating _ if @xmath43 . thus under the above mentioned identification between @xmath20 and @xmath32",
    "generating @xmath2-tuples of @xmath1 correspond precisely to epimorphisms @xmath44 .",
    "the set @xmath45 of all epimorphisms from @xmath21 to @xmath1 is @xmath31-invariant , and , as follows from the discussion above , two elements of @xmath46 are in the same @xmath31-orbit if and only if the corresponding generating @xmath2-tuples of @xmath1 are nielsen equivalent . in general , it is quite hard to distinguish nielsen equivalence classes of @xmath2-tuples that generate the same subgroup .",
    "the only exception is the case @xmath47 . here",
    "a basic result , again due to nielsen @xcite , says that if @xmath48 in @xmath1 then @xmath49 $ ] is conjugate to @xmath50 $ ] or @xmath50^{-1}$ ] in @xmath1 .",

    "it follows that if @xmath61 is another generating tuple for @xmath1 then @xmath62    the operation of making an @xmath2-tuple of elements of @xmath1 into an @xmath55-tuple by appending the @xmath55-st entry equal to @xmath63 is sometimes called a _",
    "stabilization move_. as we observed above , any two generating @xmath2-tuples of a group @xmath1 become nielsen equivalent after @xmath2 stabilization moves .",
    "apart from characterizing free bases of @xmath21 in terms of nielsen equivalence , nielsen also obtained a complete characterization of generating tuples of @xmath21 .",
    "thus he proved that if @xmath64 and @xmath65 are such that @xmath66 then @xmath67 and @xmath68    recently louder  @xcite obtained a similar result for the fundamental groups of closed surfaces .",
    "stabilization moves for nielsen equivalence are also important in the theory of finite groups .",
    "it is well - known that every non - abelian finite simple group @xmath1 has rank @xmath69 , and the commutator trick mentioned above allows to produce finite simple groups with an arbitrary large number of nielsen equivalence classes of generating 2-tuples .",
    "however , the situation becomes markedly different for generating @xmath2-tuples with @xmath70 .",
    "a well - known , and still open , _ wiegold conjecture _ says that if @xmath1 is a finite simple group ( and hence @xmath71 ) then for every @xmath70 any two generating @xmath2-tuples of @xmath1 are nielsen - equivalent , that is @xmath31 acts transitively on @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a finite simple group and @xmath72 , an equivalent formulation of weigold conjecture says that for any @xmath70 and any @xmath73 such that @xmath52 , the @xmath2-tuple @xmath74 is nielsen - equivalent to @xmath75 .",
    "stablilization moves also play a key role in the so - called _ product replacement algorithm _ for producing `` random '' elements in finite simple groups , see  @xcite .    as noted above , for @xmath47",
    "a classic result of nielsen shows that if @xmath1 is any group and 2-tuples @xmath76 and @xmath77 of elements of @xmath1 are nielsen equivalent , then @xmath49 $ ] is conjugate to @xmath50^{\\pm 1}$ ] in @xmath1 .",
    "no such criteria exist for @xmath2-tuples with @xmath70 and there are few known results distinguishing nielsen - equivalence classes of generating @xmath2-tuples for @xmath70 .",
    "note that even in the algorithmically nice setting of torsion - free word - hyperbolic groups the problem of deciding if two tuples are nielsen equivalent is algorithmically undecidable .",
    "indeed , the subgroup membership problem is a special case of this problem since two tuples @xmath78 and @xmath79 are nielsen equivalent if and only if @xmath80 .",
    "therefore nielsen equivalence is not decidable for finitely presented torsion - free small cancellation groups since in general , by a result of rips  @xcite , such groups have undecidable subgroup membership problem .",
    "let us mention here some of the known results regarding distinguishing nielsen equivalence of generating @xmath81-tuples for infinite finitely generated groups .",
    "apart from the special and much easier case of @xmath82 , these can be mostly separated into two distinct approaches .",
    "the first approach is algebraic ( @xmath83-theoretic ) .",
    "the earliest work is due to noskov @xcite who showed that there exist non - minimal generating tuples that are not nielsen equivalent to a tuple containing the trivial element and thereby giving a negative answer to a question of waldhausen .",
    "these results where later generalized by evans @xcite .    lustig and moriah @xcite , @xcite",
    ", @xcite used algebraic methods to distinguish nielsen equivalence classes of fuchsian groups and other groups with appropriate presentations .",
    "this enabled them to distinguish isotopy classes of vertical heegaard splittings of seifert manifolds .",
    "recently evans @xcite , for any given number @xmath84 , produced large generating @xmath2-tuples of metabelian groups @xmath1 that do not become nielsen equivalent after @xmath84 stabilization moves ( adding the trivial element to the tuples @xmath84 times ) .",
    "evans examples are the first examples of this type in the literature even for the case @xmath85 . however , in these examples @xmath2 is much bigger than the rank of the group @xmath1 .",
    "the second approach is combinatorial - geometric and is closer in spirit to nielsen s original work since it relies mostly on using cancellation methods .",
    "first in line is grushko s theorem @xcite which states that any generating tuple of a free product is nielsen equivalent to a tuple of elements that lie in the union of the factors .",
    "together with recent work of the second author @xcite this implies that nielsen equivalence of irreducible generating tuples in a free product is decidable if and only if it is decidable in the factors .",
    "zieschang @xcite proves that any minimal generating tuple of a surface group is nielsen equivalent to the standard generating tuple and proves a similar result for fuchsian groups that lead to the solution of the rank problem @xcite .",
    "nielsen equivalence in fuchsian groups has been studied by many authors .",
    "as discussed above , recently louder @xcite has generalized zieschangs result to arbitrary generating tuples .",
    "the finiteness of nielsen equivalence classes of @xmath81-tuples for torsion - free locally quasiconvex - hyperbolic groups has been established by the authors @xcite generalizing a result of delzant @xcite who studied 2-generated groups .",
    "kapovich and schupp @xcite have established uniqueness of the nielsen equivalence class of minimal generating tuples for a class of generic finitely presented groups closely related to the one studied in the present article .",
    "our main result is :    [ thm : a ] let @xmath0 be an arbitrary integer .",
    "there exists a generic set @xmath86 of @xmath87-tuples @xmath88 where for each @xmath89 every @xmath90 is a freely reduced word in @xmath91 , every @xmath92 is a freely reduced word in @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and such that for each @xmath95 the following holds :    let @xmath1 be a group given by the presentation @xmath96 then @xmath1 is a torsion - free one - ended word - hyperbolic group with @xmath97 , and the @xmath5-tuples @xmath98 and @xmath99 are not nielsen - equivalent in @xmath1 .    the precise meaning of @xmath86 being generic is explained in section  [ s : generic ] .",
    "however , the main point of theorem  [ thm : a ] is to prove the existence of groups @xmath1 with the above properties .",
    "genericity considerations are used as a tool for justifying existence of tuples @xmath9 such that @xmath1 given by presentation ( * ) satisfies the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : a ] . in an earlier paper  @xcite we proved , using rather different arguments from those used in the present article , a weaker related statement .",
    "namely , we proved that if @xmath1 is given by presentation ( * ) corresponding to a generic tuple @xmath100 , then the @xmath55-tuples @xmath101 and @xmath102 are not nielsen equivalent in @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "we also conjectured that the statement of theorem  [ thm : a ] should hold .",
    "we briefly outline the idea of the proof of theorem  [ thm : a ] .",
    "first , we pass from presentation ( * ) of @xmath1 to the presentation @xmath103 where @xmath104 is obtained by freely and cyclically reducing the word @xmath105 in @xmath106 , where @xmath107",
    ". genericity of ( * ) implies that presentation ( * * ) satisfies an arbitrarily strong small cancellation condition @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is an arbitrarily small fixed number .",
    "suppose that the @xmath5-tuples @xmath98 and @xmath99 are nielsen - equivalent in @xmath1 .",
    "then in the free group @xmath106 the @xmath5-tuples @xmath98 is nielsen equivalent to a tuple of freely reduced @xmath106-words @xmath110 such that @xmath111 for @xmath30 . among all such tuples @xmath110",
    "we choose one of minimal complexity , in the appropriate sense .",
    "we then consider the labelled graph @xmath112 given by a wedge of @xmath113 loops labelled by the words @xmath114 .",
    "the fact that @xmath115 in @xmath106 implies that the graph @xmath112 admits a finite sequence of stallings folds taking it to the graph @xmath116 which is the wedge of @xmath2 loop - edges labelled @xmath117 .",
    "in this folding sequence we look at the last term @xmath118 such that @xmath118 does not contain a copy of @xmath116 as a subgraph .",
    "then @xmath112 folds onto @xmath118 and @xmath118 contains a subgraph @xmath119 consisting of @xmath120 edges such that @xmath119 transforms into a graph containing @xmath116 by a single fold . by construction , the first betti number of @xmath118 is @xmath121 , which puts combinatorial constrains on the topology of @xmath118 which we later exploit .",
    "the @xmath106-words @xmath122 are readable in @xmath112 and therefore they are also readable in @xmath118 . using genericity and small cancellation theory considerations and the fact that @xmath111 for @xmath123 we conclude that for some @xmath124 the word @xmath125 contains a subword @xmath126 which is almost all of a cyclic permutation @xmath127 of some @xmath128 . the subword @xmath126 in the label of the @xmath129-th petal of @xmath112 projects to a path @xmath130 with label @xmath126 in @xmath118 .",
    "since words readable in @xmath119 are highly non - generic , we exploit the genericity properties of @xmath9 to conclude that there is some `` long '' ( comprising a definite portion of the length of @xmath131 ) arc @xmath132 in @xmath133 with label @xmath134 such that @xmath130 runs over @xmath132 exactly once .",
    "we then perform a surgery on @xmath118 by replacing @xmath132 in @xmath118 by an arc labelled by the complimentary to @xmath126 in @xmath127 word @xmath135 ( so that @xmath136 in @xmath106 ) , to obtain a graph @xmath137 .",
    "genericity considerations allow us to conclude that full the pre - image of @xmath132 in @xmath112 consists of a disjoint collections of arcs labelled @xmath134 inside the petals of @xmath112 .",
    "we replace each such arc by an arc labelled @xmath135 and freely reduce the labels of the new petals to obtain a graph @xmath138 which is a wedge of @xmath87-circles labeled @xmath139 . by construction the graph @xmath138 still folds onto @xmath137 .",
    "since @xmath137 still contains the subgraph @xmath119 , it follows that @xmath137 folds onto @xmath116 and hence @xmath138 folds onto @xmath116 as well .",
    "therefore @xmath140 is nielsen equivalent in @xmath106 to @xmath98 .",
    "we then show that the tuple @xmath140 has strictly smaller complexity than the tuple @xmath141 , yielding a contradiction to the minimal choice of @xmath141 .",
    "by a _ graph _ @xmath112 we mean a 1-dimensional cell complex , equipped with the weak topology .",
    "we refer to @xmath142-cells of @xmath112 as _ vertices _ and to open 1-cells of @xmath112 as _ topological edges_. the set of all vertices of @xmath112 is denoted @xmath143 and the set of topological edges of @xmath112 is denoted @xmath144 . for each topological edge @xmath145 of @xmath112",
    "we fix a _ characteristic map _",
    "\\gamma$ ] which is the attaching map for @xmath145 .",
    "thus @xmath147 is a continuous map whose restriction to @xmath148 is a homeomorphism between @xmath148 and the open 1-cell @xmath145 , and the points @xmath149 are ( not necessarily distinct ) vertices of @xmath112 .",
    "each topological edge @xmath145 is homeomorphic to @xmath148 and thus , being a connected 1-manifold , it admits exactly two possible orientations .",
    "an _ oriented edge _ or just _ edge _ of @xmath112 is a topological edge together with the choice of an orentation on it .",
    "we denote by @xmath150 the set of all oriented edges of @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath151 is an oriented edge , we denote by @xmath152 the same topological edge with the opposite orientation .",
    "thus @xmath153 is a fixed - point - free involution on @xmath150 . for every orented edge @xmath154",
    "the attaching map for the underlying topological edge naturally defines the _ initial vertex _ @xmath155 and the _ terminal vertex _ @xmath156 of @xmath112 .",

    "an edge - path @xmath176 in @xmath112 is called _ reduced _ if @xmath176 does not contain a subpath of the form @xmath183 where @xmath154 .    for a finite graph @xmath112 (",
    "not necessarily connected ) , we denote by @xmath184 the first betti number of @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath112 is a graph and @xmath185 is a subgraph , we denote by @xmath186 the graph obtained from @xmath112 by collapsing every connected component of @xmath138 to a vertex",
    ".    we will need the following elementary but useful lemma whose proof is left to the reader :    [ lem : quotient ] let @xmath112 be a finite graph and let @xmath185 be a subgraph ( not necessarily connected ) .",
    "then @xmath187    if @xmath112 is a connected non - contractible graph , the _ core _ of @xmath112 , denoted by @xmath188 , is the smallest connected subgraph @xmath189 of @xmath112 such that the inclusion map @xmath190 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "a connected graph @xmath112 is called a _ core graph _ if @xmath191 .",
    "note that if @xmath112 is a finite connected non - cnotractible graph then @xmath112 is a core graph if and only if for every @xmath159 we have @xmath192 .",
    "if @xmath112 is a graph and @xmath159 a vertex then we call the pair @xmath193 a _ core pair _ or a _ core graph with respect to @xmath161 _ if @xmath112 contains no proper subgraph containing @xmath161 such that the inclusion map is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "thus if @xmath193 is a core graph then either @xmath112 is a core graph or @xmath112 is obtained from a core graph @xmath194 by adding segment joining @xmath161 and @xmath194 .",
