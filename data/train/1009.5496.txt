    "fe - based high-@xmath3 superconductors have attracted enormous attention for their possibly new - type superconducting mechanism and the potential of breaking the deadlock in the high-@xmath3 superconductor research field .",
    "a fluorine doped lafeaso has been discovered to be a superconductor below @xmath3= 26  k , which contains the two dimensional fe plane in the fe@xmath4as@xmath4 layer .",
    "@xcite so far , several tens of superconductors in limited types of mother materials such as lafeaso , bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , and lifeas , have been synthesized .",
    "@xcite in addition , a simple fe - se binary compound ( fese@xmath5 ) has been discovered to show superconductivity .",
    "@xcite the appearance of superconductivity in the fese system indicates fe@xmath6 ( @xmath7=p , as , and se ) layer is essential for the superconductivity in these fe - based superconductors .",
    "the density functional study has pointed out that fese is not a conventional electron - phonon superconductor , being similar to lafeaso@xmath8f@xmath9 system .",
    "@xcite other common features to the fe - based superconductors have also been revealed , which both the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and the anion height are closely related to the appearance of the superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    there are , however , many differences between fese and other fe - based superconductors : in fese ( i ) there is no separating layer and the fe@xmath4se@xmath4 layer is electrically neutral , ( ii ) the superconductivity is very sensitive to the deviation from the stoichiometric composition ,  @xcite ( iii ) there is no magnetically ordered state in @xmath10-@xmath11 phase diagram .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it is pointed out by theoretical studies that the electron correlation effect in fese is stronger than other fe - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite in fese , only a few experimental results , for instance , sommerfeld coefficient @xmath12 (= 5.4 - 9.1 mj / mol k@xmath13 ) have been so far reported  @xcite although the electron correlation effect in other fe - based superconductors was investigated by spectroscopic experiments in detail .",
    "the reason why no angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment has been reported to quantitatively evaluate the electron correlation effect in fese is that a high quality single crystal is difficult to be grown .",
    "recently , fe(se , te ) system has been intensively investigated due to the success of the high - quality single crystal growth .",
    "even so , the fe(se , te ) system is essentially different from the end member fese in the sense that the magnetically ordered state and remarkably large @xmath12 value (= 39 mj / mol k@xmath13 ) have been found .",
    "@xcite    we have examined two different synthesis processes for the fese superconductor and performed the soft - x - ray and hard - x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( sxpes and haxpes ) in order to quantitatively evaluate the electron correlation effect in the bulk . the sxpes and haxpes have been widely recognized as the powerful techniques which can reveal bulk electronic structures due to the long inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons excited by high - energy x ray .",
    "@xcite it is found in the angle - integrated pes spectrum that a large fe @xmath0 spectral weight is located in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath1 ) and it decreases steeply toward @xmath1 , being a similar feature to those in the other fe - based superconductors non - doped lafepo and lafe_pn_o@xmath14f@xmath15 ( _ pn_=p , as ) .",
    "@xcite considering the self energy correction to the results of band structure calculations , the experimentally observed band narrowing and the energy shift of the band toward @xmath1 are fully explained .",
    "the correction also provides the renormalization factor @xmath16 of @xmath170.28 and enables us to separate the incoherent part of the quasi - particle spectrum .",
    "for sxpes and haxpes measurements , single - crystalline tetragonal [ tet(single ) ] fese and polycrystalline tetragonal [ tet(poly ) ] fese were employed , together with polycrystalline hexagonal [ hex(poly ) ] fese ( likely , fe@xmath18se@xmath19 ) as a reference material.@xcite the tet(single ) fese was grown by the chemical vapor transport method using fe and se powders .  @xcite it was found to contain the hexagonal phase around the crystal edge by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) measurements .",
    "the coexistence of two stable phases has also been reported by other groups .",
    "@xcite the spot size of the sx beam in pes measurements is small ( @xmath20 ) enough to exclude signals from the hexagonal phase near the crystal edge because of the much larger sample size ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the tet(poly ) fese was synthesized using a high - frequency induction furnace .",
    "the furnace is very useful for quick cooling of the samples because this furnace can heat only the samples .",
    "this makes the pass time through other low temperature phase relatively short .",
    "the hex(poly ) fese was prepared by a conventional solid state reaction .",
    "crystal structures of both the tet(poly ) and hex(poly ) fese were also evaluated by xrd .",
    "the rietveld analysis against the xrd profiles reveals that the tet(poly ) fese sample contains the hexagonal - phase fese of 10% as an impurity and the hex(poly ) fese sample has a single phase with in the limits of the resolution . the tet(single )",
    "fese and tet(poly ) fese have the transition temperature @xmath22 @xmath176  k estimated by @xmath23 and @xmath248  k estimated by @xmath25 measurements under ambient pressure , respectively , which are similar to reported values .",
    "@xcite this implies the present samples have the selenium defect of few percent .",

    "the se @xmath0 core - level pes spectra in both crystal phases excited by sx have a sharp doublet peak structure originating from se @xmath33 and @xmath34 components as shown in fig .",

    "there is no surface - derived peak and only weak plasmon satellites are seen on the higher binding energy ( @xmath35 ) side of the se @xmath0 peaks , indicating that the surface contributions to the spectra can be ruled out in the sxpes for the shallow core levels ( including the valence band ) for fese .",
    "in addition , the spectra in the tetragonal fese have the shoulder structure on the lower @xmath35 side , which originates from the fe @xmath32 states . in the haxpes",
    "the intensity of the shoulder is enhanced since the photoionization cross section @xmath36 of fe @xmath32 states relative to that of se @xmath0 states increases by a factor of 8 compared with the sxpes .",
    "@xcite we have obtained the tetragonal and/or hexagonal components in each sample by a deconvolution procedure .",
    "@xcite the se @xmath0 peaks in the tetragonal and hexagonal components are located at the certain energies in these samples , respectively , as shown by solid and dotted bars in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the peak of the tetragonal component is located at the @xmath35 which is about 300  mev higher than that of the hexagonal one .",
    "this shift is caused by the structural difference , in other words , the difference of the covalent bond strength between these compounds , being consistent with what se @xmath37 states have a different structure in the valence band of these compounds ( discussed later ) .",
    "we note that the tet(poly ) fese has the hexagonal component of 20  % in the se @xmath0 core - level pes spectrum .",
    "the influence of the hexagonal fese inclusion on other spectra of tet(poly ) fese will be discussed later .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] ( a ) shows valence - band sxpes and haxpes spectra of the tetragonal and hexagonal fese . in both the tetragonal and hexagonal fese the sxpes spectra have a sharp peak in the vicinity of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , there are some broad peaks and hump structures in the higher @xmath35 region .",
    "the spectra of the tetragonal fese have the features very similar to the recently reported result .",
    "@xcite these structures consist of fe @xmath0 and se @xmath37 states as has been revealed later by comparison with theoretical spectra . in the haxpes spectrum , it is found that the peak near @xmath1 is suppressed and the structures in the @xmath35=3 - 7  ev become dominant .",
    "such a variation of the spectral shape in the sxpes and haxpes does not mainly originate from the increase of the bulk sensitivity but from the ratio of @xmath36 between fe @xmath0 and se @xmath37 states , that is , fe(@xmath0)/se(@xmath37 ) is 2.8 at h@xmath29690  ev and 0.033 at @xmath178  kev .",
    "this indicates that the haxpes spectrum of the valence band is nearly equivalent to the se @xmath37 ( including weak and broad @xmath38 ) states .",
    "now we focus on the similarity and difference of the electronic structures between the tetragonal and hexagonal fese .",
    "they have rather different se @xmath37 electronic structures between @xmath35= 3  ev and 5  ev as recognized in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( a ) .",
    "furthermore , high - resolution pes spectra reveal that fe @xmath0 states near @xmath1 also have different features as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( b ) .",
    "we note that each spectrum of tet(poly ) and hex(poly ) fese is normalized by the integrated intensity of its high - resolution whole valence - band pes spectrum after subtracting the background .",
    "the tet(poly ) fese has a prominent peak at @xmath39 180  mev .",
    "the photoemission intensity decreases steeply toward @xmath1 and is very weak at @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile , the hex(poly ) fese has a less prominent peak , which is closer to @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the obvious fermi cut off is observed in the hex(poly ) fese .",
    "here we would stress that the spectra near @xmath1 in the tet(single ) fese is in good agreement with in the tet(poly ) fese , indicating that the influence of the hexagonal fese inclusion in tet(poly ) fese is negligible near @xmath1 .",
    "fe @xmath40 core - level pes spectra of the tetragonal and hexagonal fese are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "there is no charge - transfer satellite , as has been pointed out in lafeaso .",
    "@xcite in addition , one can see the sharp - peak - and - shoulder structure in the @xmath41 component of the sxpes spectra of both the tet(single ) and tet(poly ) fese as indicated by solid and dotted bars .",
    "considering that the sharp peak becomes more prominent in the haxpes spectrum , the peak can be assigned to the bulk @xmath42 component .",
    "the sharp peak structure suggests the existence of the highly coherent valence electrons in the bulk .",
    "then , the shoulder structure is attributed to the photoemission from the surface ( and grain boundaries in the polycrystalline sample ) .",
    "these indicate that the photoelectrons with the low @xmath43 ( of less than a few hundred ev ) lead to the large surface contribution to the spectrum even in the sxpes experiment .",
    "@xcite the possibility can not be ruled out that the slightly stronger shoulder intensity in the sxpes spectrum of tet(poly ) fese than that of tet(single ) fese originates from the influence of the hexagonal fese inclusion .",
    "meanwhile , the hex(poly ) fese has a broad peak originating from multiplet structures .",

    "fe @xmath0 states are strongly suppressed since the tuned photon energy corresponds to the energy providing the mostly minimum transition probability in the fano lineshape .",
    "@xcite one can see that the spectral weight between @xmath1 and @xmath35=3  ev is remarkably reduced .",
    "this indicates fe @xmath0 dominant states are located in this @xmath35 range .",

    "[ fig_2 ] ( a ) .",
    "meanwhile , no significant reduction above @xmath35=3  ev is seen except for the slight decrease around @xmath35=4  ev , since these structures mainly originate from se @xmath37 states .",
    "we note that one often employs the ( on- ) resonant pes to investigate the contribution of the specific electronic states by using the photon energy tuned to the core - level absorption maximum . in the present case , however , the auger decay process becomes dominant and the valence - band structures are smeared out due to the large background .",

    "<S> we have investigated the electronic structures of recently discovered superconductor fese by soft - x - ray and hard - x - ray photoemission spectroscopy with high bulk sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the large fe @xmath0 spectral weight is located in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath1 ) , which is demonstrated to be a coherent quasi - particle peak . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the results of the band structure calculation with local - density approximation , fe @xmath0 band narrowing and the energy shift of the band toward @xmath1 are found , suggesting an importance of the electron correlation effect in fese . </S>",
    "<S> the self energy correction provides the larger mass enhancement value ( @xmath23.6 ) than in fe - as superconductors and enables us to separate a incoherent part from the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these features are quite consistent with the results of recent dynamical mean - field calculations , in which the incoherent part is attributed to the lower hubbard band . </S>"
