    "in a recent article @xcite it is stated that quantum effects in spontaneous emission by a relativistic electron beam in an undulator can be described by a drift - diffusion equation only when the parameter    @xmath3    is much smaller than unity , where @xmath4 is the number of undulator periods , @xmath5 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath6 is the photon frequency , @xmath7 the relativistic lorentz factor , @xmath8 the electron rest mass and @xmath9 the speed of light . in that work",
    "it is argued that when @xmath10 , a drift - diffusion equation is no more sufficient to describe the the evolution of the distribution of electron momenta , which `` occurs as discrete momentum groups according to a poisson distribution '' .    in this paper",
    "we will show that results in @xcite are incorrect , because they are based on a one - dimensional model of the spontaneous radiation emission .",
    "this model does not account for the angular distribution of the radiation , but only for the emission on axis , which is characterized by an overall relative bandwidth @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast to this , the electron recoil related with the quantized nature of photons depends on the entire angular distribution of the radiation , which is fundamentally linked to the thomson scattering phenomenon in the case for a small undulator parameter @xmath12 , @xcite . when the angular distribution of radiation is properly accounted for ,",
    "the overall , angle - integrated relative bandwidth is independent on the number of undulator periods . as a result",
    ", it turns out that a three - dimensional drift - diffusion model is valid when the parameter    @xmath13    is much smaller than unity .",
    "this means that a fokker - planck approach is always valid in all cases of practical interest .    in this work",
    "we will first review the spectral - angular characteristics of undulator radiation . for reasons of simplicity , from the very",
    "beginning we will consider the limit for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "our considerations can easily be applied to arbitrary values of @xmath4 and @xmath16 , but the choice of @xmath14 and @xmath15 easily allows one to underline the fundamental point that the angle - integrated spectrum of radiation does not depend on the number of undulator periods @xmath4 . using a fokker - planck equation we will derive the diffusion coefficient in agreement with @xcite .",
    "finally , the diffusion coefficient will also be derived by exploiting the relation between undulator radiation and thomson scattering , which stresses once more the intrinsic three - dimensional nature of the radiation pattern .",
    "as is well - known , spontaneous radiation emission from an ultrarelativistic electron in an undulator can be modeled fully classically as long as the energy of the emitted photons @xmath17 is much smaller than the electron energy @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", the knowledge of the classical characteristics of radiation can easily be used to discuss quantum effects on the electron motion integrated along the trajectory .",
    "characteristics of spontaneous radiation have been studied long time ago in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review them , focusing on the particular case of a planar undulator , and following notations introduced in previous works of us @xcite . in order to do so",

    ", we introduce the slowly varying electric field envelope @xmath23}$ ] , which does not vary much along the longitudinal coordinate @xmath24 on the scale of the reduced wavelength @xmath25 .",
    "we can specify `` how near '' @xmath6 is to the resonant frequency of the undulator , @xmath26 , by introducing a detuning parameter @xmath27 , defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 is the undulator period , @xmath16 is the undulator parameter , which is related to the undulator magnetic field @xmath32 by    @xmath33    and @xmath34 .",
    "we further simplify our considerations by considering from the beginning the case for @xmath35 and @xmath14 .",
    "these two assumptions do not change the nature of our considerations , and are introduces for simplicity only .",
    "one obtains    @xmath36 \\left\\{\\left[1-\\frac { \\theta_x^2 \\omega } { k_w c}\\right]\\vec{e}_x + \\left[\\frac { \\theta_x \\theta_y \\omega } { k_w c}\\right]\\vec{e}_y\\right\\}\\cr & & \\times \\mathrm{sinc}\\left[\\frac{l_w}{4}\\left(c + { \\omega \\theta^2 \\over{2 c } } \\right ) \\right ] ~ , \\label{undurad4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are horizontal and vertical angles identifying the angular position of an observer and @xmath39 . here and everywhere in this paper",
    "we will be using gaussian units . the total energy emitted per unit spectral interval per unit",
    "solid angle turns out to be    @xmath40 ^ 2 + \\left[\\frac { \\theta_x \\theta_y \\omega } { k_w c}\\right]^2\\right\\ } \\mathrm{sinc}^2\\left[\\frac{l_w}{4}\\left(c + { \\omega \\theta^2 \\over{2 c } } \\right ) \\right ] ~,\\cr & & \\label{dwdodw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in agreement with @xcite .",

    "note that here we already set @xmath47 in the limit for @xmath48 .",
    "( [ dwdw ] ) is in agreement with expressions in literature , e.g. @xcite ( where the energy spectrum was first calculated ) and @xcite .    for us ,",
    "the important point to be underlined by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ dwdw ] ) is the fact that the radiation spectrum depends on the number of undulator periods only through a scaling factor . in other words ,",
    "the bandwidth is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for this is that we are now considering the spectrum integrated over angles . at variance ,",
    "the on - axis spectral bandwidth exhibits a dependence on the number of undulator periods , and scales as @xmath49 .",
    "the authors of @xcite consider form the very beginning a one - dimensional model and explicitly state that `` the linewidth of wiggler radiation is @xmath50 '' .",
    "this is correct if one considers the on - axis spectrum only , for example analyzing the undulator output through a pinhole . in our case of interest , however , we want to discuss the effect of the electron recoil due to the quantized nature of radiation , and the electron does not distinguish radiation emitted on axis from radiation emitted at an angle",
    ". the one - dimensional model in @xcite can not be applied , and the linewidth of the radiation is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the previous derivations and observations should convince the reader that the parameter @xmath51 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) is unphysical , and that a fokker - planck equation can properly describe the evolution of the electron density , as long as @xmath52 .",
    "the coefficient of quantum diffusion in a bending magnet was calculated for the first time in @xcite .",
    "this expression is valid for calculations of energy diffusion in the undulator at large values of the undulator parameter . at arbitrary values of @xmath16",
    "the quantum diffusion coefficient was calculated in @xcite .",
    "let us write the evolution equation for a particular projection of the electron phase space as a function the energy - time variables .",
    "calling with @xmath53 this projection of the electron density phase space , and with @xmath54 the probability to find an electron with energy between @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the time interval @xmath57 , we write the evolution equation as    @xmath58    where    @xmath59    and    @xmath60    eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) is just the rate of mean energy lost of an electron , eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) gives the diffusion coefficient we are after .",
    "we impose energy conservation by setting @xmath61 . by noting that    @xmath62    and using eq .",
    "( [ dwdw ] ) we obtain    @xmath63    not surprisingly , eq . ( [ coeff ] ) is in agreement with the result obtained in @xcite in the limit for @xmath12 .",
    "note that despite the use of a one - dimensional model , authors of @xcite find parametric agreement with eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) in the case for @xmath64 .",
    "the reason for this is that for @xmath64 they use a drift - diffusion equation .",
    "they can not recover the exact numerical result , since they miss the contribution to the diffusion coefficient coming from radiation emitted at angles different from zero , due to the incorrect choice of a one - dimensional model , but the right parameters are nevertheless present in this asymptote .",
    "however , the use of the one - dimensional model leads to the introduction of the unphysical parameter @xmath51 , and to the consequent introduction of an artificial quantum effect that does not exist in reality for @xmath10 .",
    "it is straightforward to underline the well - known equivalence between the previously obtained results and thomson scattering of radiation .",
    "in fact , in the limit for @xmath35 and @xmath14 and in the reference system of the electron , the undulator magnetic field is seen as a plane wave interacting with the electron with frequency    @xmath65    this simple observation includes the essence of the weizscker - williams method of virtual quanta @xcite , and allows to calculate the quantum diffusion coefficient , eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) , following an alternative derivation in the rest frame .    due to the presence of the electron , the plane wave scatters radiation as a function of the rest frame angle . under the approximation",

    "we can say that eq .",
    "( [ thompol ] ) is related to the probability of scattering a photon in the solid angle @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , remembering that the radiation pulse in the rest frame has a duration given by @xmath73 , the number of photons scattered in @xmath74 can be written as    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the time - averaged poynting vector of the radiation incident on the electron in the rest frame .",
    "note that only elastic scattering takes place under the over - mentioned assumption @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , there is no change of photon frequency in the scattering process .",
    "since the wave packet incident on the electron includes @xmath14 period we can assume , with accuracy @xmath77 , that the incoming wave packet is composed of a single frequency .",
    "this explain why eq .",
    "( [ resti ] ) is not analyzed in frequency .",
    "the magnitude of the time - averaged poynting vector of the radiation incident on the electron in the rest frame can be found remembering that , which presents a correction of order @xmath78 with respect to eq .",

    "( [ dpl ] ) allows us to calculate this quantity by averaging over the number of photons scattered at angles @xmath68 in the rest frame , eq .",
    "( [ resti ] ) .",

    "in this paper we showed that quantum effects in spontaneous radiation emission can be satisfactorily modeled via a drift - diffusion model .",
    "it is of fundamental importance to treat spontaneous radiation within a three - dimensional model .",
    "this is explained by the fact that an electron feeling photon recoil does not filter photons along a privileged direction , but reacts to photons emitted at all angles . in this case ,",
    "contrarily to what has been argued in @xcite , the linewidth of spontaneous radiation must be integrated over all angles , and is independent of the number of undulator periods @xmath4 .",
    "it follows from our analysis that if one enforces a three - dimensional model for the spontaneous emission , a drift - diffusion model remains valid up to photon energies smaller than the electron energy , which practically means always .",
    "this conclusion is also in contrast with @xcite , where the assumption of a linewidth scaling with @xmath49 leads to the identification of an unphysical parameter scaling as @xmath4 , and to the rise of artificial quantum effects when this parameters becomes comparable with unity .",
