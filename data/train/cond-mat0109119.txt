    "making a short review of latest publications on the percolation phenomenon one could come to the conclusion that the percolation theory @xcite is a universal paradigm for physics , sociology and economy .",
    "in fact , percolating systems composed of large number of interacting units can be simply adopted for simulations of complex behaviours and environments .",
    "number of such adoptions have been done so far including microscopic simulations of the stock market @xcite , social percolation models @xcite and marketing percolation describing diffusion of innovations @xcite . here",
    "we propose a simple model basing on the intuitive similarity between percolation and banking networks .    at present economists",
    "are in agreement that the robustness of a country financial system is related to the strength of a domestic economy .",
    "bank bankruptcies usually follow dramatic changes in the banking capital , assets as well as liabilities and can be socially costly . in general two factors may cause a bank failure : bad credits and rapid withdrawing of deposits .",
    "economic researches confirm that solvent and insolvent banks alike can experience withdrawals for reasons unrelated to the bank failure risk in circumstances of a banking panic @xcite .",
    "the same investigations emphasize the importance of withdrawals rates .",
    "in fact , sudden withdrawals can have dramatic effects on the bank stability and may force a bank to bankruptcy in a short time if it does not receive assistance from other banks . on the other hand",
    "a bankruptcy of a single bank can start an avalanche of other bank failures due to the _ domino effect_.",
    "in our model banks are represented by vertices in a lattice that for simplicity has a square or cubic symmetry . directed connections that are randomly distributed between banks simulate flows of money .",
    "banking capital consists of assets and liabilities as in reality .",
    "arrows entering into vertices represent liabilities ( deposits of other banks ) .",
    "branches with opposite direction reflect assets ( investments and given credits ) .",
    "it follows that an average number of arrows entering into a vertex is equal to an average number of exiting arrows .",
    "we assume that even one withdrawal or bad credit can force the bank bankruptcy and one failing bank can cause bankruptcies of other banks . only _ interbank _",
    "credit connections are considered , i.e. bank deposits and investments are neglected and no insurance system is assumed in our model .",
    "dynamical rules governing time evolution of the model are as follows .",
    "initially each bank is solvent .",
    "the first bankrupt is selected at random and we do not specify the reason for this bankruptcy that can be a bad credit or sudden deposit withdrawal . during the next time step neighbouring banks loss their solvency if they gave a loan to the bankrupt .",
    "this process is repeated until no bank survives that gave a bad interbank credit .",
    "above mentioned rules become comprehensible after tracing fig .",
    "the figure presents a system with @xmath0 banks .",
    "all possible flows of money ( connections between vertices ) are realized in this pattern .",
    "let us choose the 7th vertex as the first bankrupt . according to rules assumed earlier the collapse of this bank forces suspension of two other banks with numbers @xmath1 . during the next step three other banks",
    "are swept @xmath2 . at the end ,",
    "the avalanche originating from the bank with the number @xmath3 includes nine banks @xmath4 .    despite the seeming similarity of our model to the well known _ directed percolation _ @xcite it is based on a new approach to this phenomenon . in the traditional",
    "directed percolation directions in space are not equal i.e. the system is anisotropic and one direction , which is called the growth direction , is special . in our model",
    "all directions are equal .",
    "there is also another feature distinguishing the presented model from the standard percolation . in both cases of the traditional site and bond percolation",
    "each occupied site / bond belongs to _ only one _ cluster . in our model",
    "this condition is not valid and the same bank can be included to _",
    "avalanches depending on the first bankrupt .",
    "we investigated statistics of bankrupt avalanches in systems characterized by different mean concentrations @xmath5 of existing interbank deposits .",
    "it follows that the system parameter is the same as in the percolation theory . in analogy to the traditional percolation",
    "one can expect a critical value @xmath6 when an avalanche composed of bankrupts can spread _ all over _ the banking network .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the percolation phase transition .",
    "we performed numerical calculations in order to estimate @xmath6 and basing on the finite size scaling law @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the linear size of the system ) we found that critical values @xmath9 in our model are approximately two times larger than in the usual bond percolation , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the square and the cubic lattice respectively .",
    "we observed that distributions of avalanche lengths have the same properties as statistics of cluster numbers in the usual percolation system . at the percolation threshold the probability that a random bank causes @xmath12-avalanche ( failures of @xmath12 other banks )",
    "fulfills the power law @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fisher exponent . in both two and three dimensional systems",
    "numerically calculated fisher exponents are consistent with their equivalents taken from the literature ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for @xmath5 near @xmath6 and for @xmath15 we found a good agreement with the scaling law describing avalanche distribution @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is a universal scaling function . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] illustrates this law for a square lattice when the scaling exponent @xmath18 has been used .",
    "dynamical properties of our model are described by the number of banks @xmath19 swept during the bankruptcy avalanche up to the moment @xmath20 where @xmath12 is the total avalanche length ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "a typical plot of @xmath19 ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) has two regions separated by a _",
    "crossover time _",
    "@xcite . initially , when @xmath23 the number of bankrupts increases as @xmath24 . in the dynamic scaling theory of surface growth the analogous exponent @xmath25",
    "is called the _",
    "growth exponent_. fortunately for bank shareholders , the power - law increase is followed by the saturation regime for @xmath26 .",
    "the saturation time @xmath22 depends on the avalanche length as @xmath27 . by analogy to the standard terminology @xcite we call @xmath28 the _ dynamic exponent_. we found that the avalanche growth in our model fulfills the family - vicsek scaling relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a universal scaling function ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath25 , @xmath31 , @xmath28 are connected by the equation @xmath32 . according to our numerical studies for the square lattice the exponents account to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and do not depend on the system parameter @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows time distributions of bankruptcies belonging to avalanches presented at fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , i.e. the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are the first derivatives of those in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . observing the speed of avalanche spreading",
    "we found a clear maximum which corresponds to the highest probability of bankruptcy .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] clearly show that there is a unique mechanism governing avalanche growth in our model .",
    "the mechanism is independent on the system parameter as well as on the avalanche length .",
    "our preliminary studies on cubic lattices prove that the same mechanism governs the avalanche growth in three dimensional systems .    according to our knowledge",
    "this work is the first one connecting problems of bank failures with the statistical physics .",
    "although exact data concerning spatial and time evolution of mass bankruptcies are hard to receive , it is known that such bankruptcies were quite frequent in the nineteenth and twentieth century @xcite .",
    "the banking crisis that accompanied the great depression was probably the most dramatic .",
    "economists distinguish three waves of bank failures during this period and the third wave ( starting in may 1932 ) can be seen as qualitatively consistent with our directed percolation model .",
    "in fact , during the period may - sep 1932 distributions of total bank suspensions in illinois , the chicago federal reserve district and the usa have shapes ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) similar to the time profile observed in our model ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the situation during the earlier massive bank collapses in usa there was no significant interventions from government institutions in order to stop the contagion of banking system in this time @xcite .",
    "at present government institutions guard security of banking system therefore the black scenario known from the great depression seems incredible but it can repeat .",
    "it is necessarily to emphases that the proposed model would be more realistic if it were widened to the whole financial system composed not only of banks but also other financial institutions like trust or pension funds , insurance companies and firms .",
    "although each institution enumerated above possesses a different capital structure but all of them suffer from risks related to bad investments / credits and are connected one to another .",
    "the model presented here has been thought to reflect the cooperative behaviour of banking systems .",
    "we have shown that avalanches of bankruptcies can be related to clusters in the random directed percolation problem .",
    "it follows that a large number of interbank credits can lead to the percolation phase transition when bankruptcies can spread all over the banking network .",
    "static and dynamic properties of this model are in a good agreement with the percolation theory .",
    "the observed in numerical simulations shape of avalanche spreading is in a qualitative agreement with data from the great depression .",
