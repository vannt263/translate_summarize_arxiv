    "the formulation of high energy scattering introduced by glauber @xcite has a long tradition in being applied to calculating nuclear reactions with hadronic as well as electromagnetic probes .",
    "today glauber amplitudes are widely used to account for final state interactions in ( e , ep ) reactions at high and intermediate energies  @xcite .",
    "glauber theory is applied to investigate color transparency , in @xmath0 reactions and in the electroproduction of mesons @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is applied to heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "most recently , several generalizations of glauber theory have been employed for the description of electron scattering mainly from lighter nuclei , e.g. the generalized eikonal approximation ( gea ) @xcite , or relativistic eikonal approaches @xcite .",
    "these methods are applied both to @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions .",
    "nuclear scattering at intermediate energies in the context of radioactive beams also takes advantage of this formulation  @xcite .    despite the widespread use of the glauber formulation in reactions involving few as well as many - body systems",
    "there has been little work on rigorous tests of the accuracy and/or limits of the glauber ansatz , apart from some studies concerning the quality of the eikonal approximation for @xmath0 reactions  @xcite as well as for elastic proton scattering from halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "only recently exact faddeev calculations for three - body scattering in the intermediate energy regime became available .",
    "this progress is based on a formulation of the faddeev equations , which is based directly on momentum variables and does not rely on traditional partial wave expansions .",
    "the formulation and numerical realization for the nonrelativistic faddeev equations  @xcite as well as fully poincar invariant ones  @xcite have been carried out for scalar interactions up to projectile energies of 2  gev .",
    "this now allows us to perform a detailed comparison of three - body faddeev calculations of total and elastic cross sections with the ones obtained by glauber calculations , and thus test the range of validity of glauber calculations at least in the three - body system .",
    "the naive expectation is that for sufficiently high energies the total @xmath3 cross section is just the sum of the two total cross sections for two - nucleon scattering .",
    "the question whether this is valid is an old one and has been investigated in the context of the eikonal approximation  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that rescattering ( shadowing ) corrections need to be added . since at the time no exact calculations were available , the question remained open , whether those corrections were sufficient and at which energy the eikonal approximation became valid .",
    "we will investigate such questions in this work and mostly follow the formulation given in refs .",
    "in order to make closer contact with that work as well as for transparency , we will use the nonrelativistic formulation of the faddeev equation for our comparison , even though we carry out calculations in the intermediate energy regime .",
    "we will also use the same two - body scattering amplitude as well as deuteron wave function in the glauber calculation as enters in our faddeev results , so that we can clearly identify the effects of the glauber approximation on the multiple scattering . in section",
    "ii we will briefly present the faddeev framework and its multiple scattering expansion , and in section  iii we will re - derive the essential expressions of the glauber approximation necessary for the comparison to the faddeev formulation . our numerical results for the total and differential cross section for elastic scattering in both formulations and their discussion will be given in section  iv .",

    "the curves are essentially flat , meaning that the first order term given by @xmath104 is already sufficient to capture the result of a full faddeev calculation . at 500  mev",
    "one needs at least one iteration ( or one rescattering term ) to reach the exact faddeev result , whereas at 200  mev one needs more terms , which however give small contributions .",
    "the middle part of the panel shows the total cross section for elastic scattering and the bottom one the total cross section for breakup reactions .",
    "while the total cross section for elastic scattering converges very fast for projectile energies above 500  mev , the one for breakup reactions requires at least one rescattering term even in the gev range .",
    "our glauber calculation contains only a first order term and a rescattering correction .",
    "first , we concentrate on the total cross section and compare each order separately with the corresponding order of the faddeev calculation .",
    "the first order terms are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as function of the projectile laboratory energy . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq3.10 ] ) the first order contribution to the total @xmath3 cross section is simply given by twice the two - body total cross section . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we see that for energies greater than 200  mev both first order terms agree .",
    "this is not surprising , since the first order faddeev term , @xmath104 , contains twice the two - body t - matrix , the permutation operator guarantees scattering contributions from both constituents of the target .",
    "our glauber calculations start from the same two - body @xmath5-matrix as the faddeev calculation . from this point of view",
    "it is not surprising that both first order calculations agree so well .",
    "the same conclusion was already reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a more crucial test is a comparison of the second order correction term . in fig .",

    "the faddeev result is shown as solid line .",
    "a first observation is that this rescattering term contributes significantly at lower energies , and is still present at 2  gev .",
    "thus , the very naive expectation that the @xmath3 total cross section comprises only the scattering from the target constituents is not fulfilled in the energy regime up to 2  gev which is considered here .",
    "there is always a contribution due to rescattering .",
    "the second order glauber correction @xmath105 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3.13 ] ) and ( [ eq3.32 ] ) is given by the short dashed line .",
    "here we see that in contrast to the first order contribution the two lines only start to agree around 1  gev .",
    "this may be understood when having in mind that the second order faddeev term is explicitly given as @xmath106 , where the free propagator @xmath107 describes the arbitrary free motion of the three particles in the intermediate state .",
    "the glauber second order term assumes that the target constituents are frozen . at sufficiently high energy",
    "this assumptions seems to be sufficient to describe the rescattering within the target , which sometimes is referred to as ` shadowing ' correction .",
    "franco and glauber @xcite suggest a further approximation to @xmath105 .",
    "they argue that if the deuteron form factor decreases much more rapidly than the scattering amplitude as function of the integration variable @xmath98 , then the integral of eq .",

    "the double - dash - dotted curve of fig .  [ fig3 ] represents this approximation .",
    "it is quite obvious that this approximation is too simplistic and gives a second order contribution almost double the size of the original correction at all energies considered .",

    "@xcite , integrals over the two - body @xmath5-matrix and the deuteron wave function were evaluated using the method of steepest descent .",
    "this is equivalent to extracting the dominant part of an integral as a constant from the integral .",
    "the failure of those two approximations should lead to the conclusion , that although it is true that for higher energies the scattering amplitude is peaked in forward direction  @xcite , the integration over the form factor is important and should not be approximated further .    after comparing the terms of the multiple scattering series separately , we show in fig .",

    ", we also add the fully converged faddeev result as dash - double - dotted line to the figure .",
    "an obvious difference between the first order and the fully converged faddeev calculations is the first diffraction minimum , which is filled in by rescattering corrections .",
    "rescattering contributions are also important for the large angle ( high momentum transfer ) behavior of the differential cross section  @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the differential cross section for similar calculations at the considerably higher energy of 1.5  gev .",
    "again , the first order faddeev calculation and the first order glauber calculations with the two different choices of @xmath114 are close to each other up to @xmath115 , which now corresponds to a momentum transfer of about 1250  mev .",
    "however , the first order calculations differ from the fully converged faddeev calculation already at much smaller angles , around @xmath116 , which corresponds to roughly 350  mev in the momentum transfer .",
    "while the glauber formulation is intended as high energy approximation , we are interested in exploring how the differential cross sections of the first order glauber and faddeev calculations compare at lower energies . in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] the differential cross sections for laboratory projectile energies of 200 and 100  mev are displayed . for 200  mev",
    "the two different choices of @xmath114 in the glauber first order calculations already differ at @xmath117 , corresponding to a momentum transfer of about 270  mev . at roughly the same angle",
    "the first order faddeev calculations also deviates from the converged solution .",
    "it is well known that the faddeev multiple scattering series converges very slowly at such low energies  @xcite , so this finding is not surprising . however , at very small angles , all calculations shown roughly agree .",
    "this becomes different , if one looks at the even lower energy of 100  mev laboratory projectile energy . here the first order glauber calculations do not agree with the first order faddeev calculation even at small angles .",
    "it is also very obvious that at this low energy the first order faddeev calculations is quite different from the fully converged one .",
    "it is however noteworthy , that both first order glauber calculations are closer to the converged faddeev result in forward direction than is the calculation based on the first order faddeev term .",
    "the two different choices for @xmath114 start to differ around @xmath117 , which corresponds now only to a momentum transfer of roughly 180  mev .",
    "the overall observation is that at such a low energy neither a first order faddeev calculation nor a glauber calculation are a good representation of the fully converged faddeev result .",
    "next we add the glauber rescattering correction of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.14 ] ) to the differential cross section . in fig  [ fig9 ]",
    "we show the effect of this term on the differential cross section at 500  mev laboratory projectile energy together with the contribution of the second order faddeev rescattering term .",
    "while the faddeev first order rescattering term gives a large contribution to the first minimum , the glauber rescattering term fails to do this , independent of the choice of the unit vector @xmath86 . obviously , the minima are more sensitive to the interference of the two terms of the scattering amplitude .",
    "thus here the very different structure of the faddeev and glauber rescattering terms are clearly visible . it should also be noted that in the first minimum one faddeev rescattering term is already sufficient to coincide with the fully converged faddeev calculation . at slightly larger angles more rescattering",
    "terms are required in the faddeev calculation to reach convergence .",
    "this general feature of the difference between the two approaches does not change with increasing energy . in fig  [ fig10 ]",
    "the differential cross section is shown for a laboratory projectile energy of 1  gev . while the total cross section for both , faddeev and glauber calculations started to agree at energies of 1  gev and higher when adding the second order correction term in both schemes , this is not the case for the differential cross section .",
    "the second order faddeev rescattering term again gives a much larger contribution in the first minimum than the glauber rescattering correction .",
    "this trend continues up to 2  gev , the highest energy we consider here .",
    "we also can observe that with increasing energy the difference between the two choices of @xmath86 decreases .",
    "to investigate at which energies there are differences , we need to consider lower projectile energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the differential cross section for 200  mev projectile laboratory energy is shown . here",
    "we can first observe , that the second order glauber correction also increases the cross section in the first minimum , but again by far less than the faddeev rescattering term does .",
    "we also observe a distinct difference between the two choices of @xmath86 . at 200",
    "mev the choice ( a ) almost has no effect at larger angles , whereas choice ( b ) shows a big contribution .",
    "however , since the glauber expression should be valid only in forward direction , one should not put any physical relevance to this difference .",
    "after having seen that the glauber rescattering term does not compare well with the corresponding faddeev term in diffraction minima , we want to consider the differential cross section in the very forward direction .",
    "this is the physical regime for which the glauber ansatz was developed and where it should perform best . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show the three - body differential cross section for very forward angles for laboratory projectile energies of 100  mev , 200  mev , 500  mev , and 800  mev .",
    "we again compare the results from the first and second order terms in the faddeev multiple scattering series to the fully converged faddeev calculation , and the first order glauber calculation with its rescattering correction to the faddeev calculations .",
    "both choices of @xmath86 coincide for very small angles .",
    "thus we arbitrarily choose ( b ) for the glauber calculations of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . since we already established from the comparison of the total cross sections , that the glauber calculations do very well for energies of 1  gev and higher , we concentrate here on low and intermediate range energies . at 800  mev essentially",
    "all calculations agree with each other in the very forward direction . at 500  mev the first order faddeev term slightly over -",
    "predicts the fully converged result .",
    "the first faddeev rescattering term has almost no effect , and one needs higher order rescattering contributions to achieve a converged result .",
    "the glauber first order calculation differs from the faddeev first order and only slightly over - predicts the converged faddeev result .",
    "the contribution of the glauber rescattering term is small , and lowers the cross section for the very forward angles directly to the full faddeev result .",
    "the situation at 200  mev is similar .",
    "again , the first order faddeev and glauber calculations differ , and the glauber calculation already coincides with the fully converged faddeev result .",
    "the glauber rescattering contribution again slightly lowers the cross section in forward direction . at this energy",
    "it is interesting to observe that the first rescattering contribution of the faddeev multiple scattering series increases the cross section in forward direction . to reach convergence eight terms of the multiple scattering series",
    "must be summed up at this energy . at 100  mev the glauber first order calculation",
    "is already quite close to the fully converged faddeev results , in contrast to the first order faddeev calculation .",
    "the glauber rescattering correction then lowers the cross section essentially to the exact faddeev result .",
    "thus , for the differential cross section in very forward direction the glauber calculation corrected by the rescattering term captures the exact faddeev result already at 100  mev .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows that this good agreement is valid to about @xmath118 .",
    "the behavior of the differential cross section in the extreme forward direction appears in a very similar fashion in the total cross section for elastic scattering , @xmath119 , which is obtained by integrating over the differential cross section .",
    "table  [ table2 ] lists the total cross sections for elastic scattering as function of the laboratory projectile energy for the converged faddeev calculations , faddeev calculations including only the first two rescattering terms as well as the glauber calculations .",
    "we see that already from 200  mev on the first order glauber calculations match the converged faddeev results reasonably well .",
    "the glauber rescattering correction is quite small , and always lowers the cross section , whereas the first faddeev rescattering correction increases the cross section , and only the second rescattering correction ( 3rd order in the multiple scattering series ) lowers it .",
    "it is also obvious from the table that at 100  mev many more terms of the faddeev multiple scattering series are necessary to obtain a converged total cross section .",
    "the glauber result with rescattering correction is similar in size to the faddeev result with two rescattering corrections , though this is most likely accidental .",
    "a glauber calculation for the total cross section for elastic scattering at 100  mev is not trustworthy anymore , since the differential cross sections do not really agree .",
    "the total cross section is the sum of the total cross sections for elastic scattering and breakup reactions , @xmath120 . in refs .",
    "@xcite this relation was used to estimate the quality of the numerical solutions of the faddeev equation . in a faddeev calculation the total cross section for breakup reactions is obtained by integration over the five - fold differential cross section for breakup , i.e. by summing over all possible breakup configurations . here",
    "we can employ this relation to obtain a total cross section for breakup reactions within the glauber framework .",
    "this is done in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the left side lists the faddeev total cross sections for elastic scattering and breakup reactions with their sum , the total cross section , as function of laboratory projectile energy .",
    "the right side lists the glauber total cross section obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq3.12 ] ) .",
    "the glauber total cross sections for breakup reactions are obtained by subtracting the glauber total cross sections for elastic scattering from table  [ table2 ] from these numbers . for energies",
    "less than 500  mev the so obtained breakup cross sections are definitely not competitive with the faddeev results .",
    "however , at 1.5  gev , the glauber breakup cross section starts to match the faddeev breakup cross section within 5% .",
    "though this finding may look surprising , it could indicate that at sufficiently high energy the dominant ejectiles of a breakup reaction exit into the forward cone .",
    "that region of phase space however is the one , for which the glauber ansatz was designed .",
    "thus it seems that for gev projectile energies obtaining a total cross section for breakup reactions from the glauber total and elastic cross section via the optical theorem captures the overall breakup reaction . of course the description of detailed exclusive @xmath3 observables will never be accessible in the glauber formulation",
    "in this study we perform fully converged faddeev calculations for three identical bosons ( our model for the @xmath3 system ) in the intermediate energy regime between 100  mev and 2  gev .",
    "we calculate total cross sections as well as differential cross sections for elastic scattering .",
    "the key point of those calculations is the use of vector momenta in the formulation , so that all partial waves are automatically included .",
    "we then calculated the same cross sections using glauber formulation  @xcite .",
    "however a key difference to this early work is that the two - body scattering amplitude entering our glauber expressions is the solution of a two - body lippmann - schwinger equation , i.e. the same input as is used in the faddeev calculations . as two - body interaction",
    "we employ a superposition of two yukawa terms , one attractive , the other repulsive , for which the parameters are chosen such that a bound state at the empirical deuteron binding energy is supported .",
    "the deuteron wave function and form factor are also calculated from this interaction .    by using the identical two - body input for the faddeev and glauber calculations we make sure that both calculations are based on the same ingredients . this way we can clearly attribute differences in the observables to the different treatment of multiple scattering in the two formulations . the first order term in the glauber formulation is given by twice the two - body scattering amplitude , which is folded with the deuteron form factor to give the differential cross section and leads to 2@xmath121 for the total cross section .",
    "the first order faddeev term is given by @xmath104 , thus having a similar structure .",
    "comparing the total cross sections obtained from the first order term leads to the conclusion that from projectile energies of about 200  mev onward both calculations agree .",
    "for the differential cross section agreement to about @xmath122 is achieved for projectile energies of 500  mev and higher . for 200  mev",
    "the angular range of agreement is already less , and at 100  mev the first order calculations do not agree with each other . in general we can conclude , that in first order the glauber and faddeev calculations for observables considered , total and differential cross sections for elastic scattering are remarkably close for energies higher than 200  mev projectile energy .",
    "the consideration of the first rescattering correction in both formulation shows that there is a distinct dependence on the observables considered . as a reminder",
    ", the glauber formulation leads only to one rescattering correction , whereas the faddeev formulation as integral equation has an in principle infinite series of rescattering corrections .",
    "as far as the correction to the total cross section is concerned , the contribution from the first glauber and faddeev rescattering term starts to become close at 500 mev and is identical in size at 1  gev .",
    "we also want to point out , that this rescattering correction to the total cross section , the shadowing ( better named anti - shadowing here , since the contribution increases the cross section ) , is still present at 2  gev , the highest energy we considered",
    ". thus we conclude , that for a good description of the total cross section in the intermediate energy regime the consideration of the second order correction in the glauber as well as in the faddeev formulation is essential .    for the differential cross section for elastic scattering the conclusions",
    "are twofold .",
    "first , when considering the very forward direction , we find that at projectile energies of 100 and 200  mev the second order correction brings the glauber calculation of the differential cross section in quite good agreement with the result of the fully converged faddeev calculation .",
    "in contrast , the first faddeev rescattering term even has the opposite effect and moves the cross section away from the converged calculation . at projectile energies of 500  mev and higher , the second order corrections in the very forward direction are extremely small and the first order faddeev and glauber calculations",
    "already agree quite well with each other and the converged faddeev calculation .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn when considering the total cross sections for elastic scattering .",
    "second , when concentrating on the diffractive structure of the differential cross section given in our model , we see distinct differences between the behavior of the faddeev and glauber second order correction .",
    "whereas the faddeev correction fills in the minima , the glauber correction can not do that .",
    "a similar observation was made in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of proton elastic scattering from halo nuclei considering energies from 100 to 200  mev per nucleon .",
    "however we find that even at much higher energies the glauber second order correction does not come close to the effect of the faddeev correction . for energies higher than 500  mev",
    "the first faddeev rescattering correction already captures the bulk of rescattering corrections and coincides with the converged calculation in the first minimum .",
    "diffraction minima are well known to be sensitive to the dynamics of the system or interference effects . the assumption of fixed target particles leading to the specific form of the glauber rescattering correction proves to be too simple to capture the much more involved structure of the first faddeev rescattering term .",
    "we also need to point out here , that the diffractive structures shown in the differential cross sections of this work are a result of our underlying assumption of identical bosons .",
    "the true @xmath3 differential cross section has only one minimum and one might speculate that a glauber calculation at higher energies including the rescattering term and being based on nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions describing the nn observables has a chance to describe the @xmath3 total cross and possibly the differential cross section certainly in forward direction quite well , provided a relativistic formulation is going to be used .",
