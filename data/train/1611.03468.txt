    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics provides a theoretical explanation for the experimental evidence on weak interactions and the masses of the corresponding mediators .",
    "this last point has its climax with the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 @xcite .",
    "even though these evidences have been important in the historical developing of the sm , the theory is far from complete since neutrino masses and dark matter appear to be issues that can not be explained by the original theory .",
    "+ the proposal of weinberg s @xmath1 operator @xcite points towards a way to extend the sm in order to include an explanation for neutrino masses , such that realizations of this operator at tree level and one loop can be achieved .",
    "other proposals can be found in @xcite . in this context , in order to obtain majorana neutrino masses it is necessary to have some mechanism to provide lepton number violation as well . when exploring supersymmetric extensions of the sm , lepton number and baryon number can be incorporated in an _",
    "ad hoc _ symmetry called _ r - parity_. amongst the proposals in this area , we are interested exclusively in the addition of bilinear r - parity violation to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) as a way to study neutrino physics . + on top of that , within the working hypothesis of a supersymmetric extension of the sm , at the present time data from atlas and cms have no direct evidence for the observation of _ sparticles _ @xcite .",
    "this seems to indicate that the supersymmetric scalar particles may be too massive to be produced at the lhc . in this context",
    "it is appealing to study models like split susy ( ss ) @xcite , where the claim is that the sfermions and one higgs doublet are very heavy and therefore they are decoupled from the low - energy theory . in the original proposal , sfermions are pushed to live at scales in the order of @xmath2 gev where the testing of sfermions at present colliders turns out to be very difficult .",
    "moreover , it leads to an _ unnatural _ model since corrections to higgs mass must be very fine tuned in order to give rise to a higgs of @xmath3 gev .",
    "however , such problems can be avoided for split susy if the sfermion masses lie around @xmath4 gev .",
    "such a scale allows for a higgs mass determined by experiments , and thus having the possibility to test effects of heavy sfermions in the present time experiments@xcite .",
    "+ the mssm plus brpv is able to generate two neutrino mass eigenvalues at loop level . if we combine split susy and brpv in one single model , though , the decoupling of scalars retaining only the operators with lowest mass dimension ( renormalizable ) , leaves a theory that can not explain the observed neutrino oscillations , since it can not produce a solar neutrino mass scale .",
    "thus , one faces a problem , on the one hand it seems that split susy is favored from collider phenomenology , while on the other hand it seems to be disfavored by neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "one alternative to solve this tension is to include new physics in terms of gravity motivated operators in order to achieve neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it would be much more attractive to solve this problem within split susy as a low energy approximation to the mssm .",
    "+ the origin of this tension between collider and neutrino phenomenology within the simplest version of split susy can be understood in the light of the underlying supersymmetric theory .",
    "a quite general theorem states that within this theory the existence of a tree level neutrino majorana mass implies the appearance of a b - l violating superpartner _",
    "majorana_-like mass term and vice versa @xcite .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the mssm with rpv terms .",
    "thus , within conventional split susy it is actually not possible to accommodate both neutrino and collider phenomenology .",
    "the problem seems to be that after integrating out the scalars and retaining the resulting renormalizable operators only , the interplay between the neutrino majorana mass and the superpartner scalars is lost , and with it , the generation of a second non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility to accommodate neutrino oscillation physics within split susy in a self consistent way ( i.e. with no addition of operators motivated from physics outside the mssm as a uv complete theory ) when going beyond the leading term after integrating out the scalar fields .",
    "other alternatives within this context have been investigated ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) , though , we will stick ourselves to original proposal of split susy and brpv",
    ". clearly it would be favorable to be able to explain the solar mass difference without the incorporation of new physics and new couplings . in this spirit",
    "it is shown that already retaining next to leading operators from the original mssm lagrangian gives rise to non - renormalizable higher dimensional operators in the effective low energy theory , which can reconcile the split susy with neutrino oscillation data .",
    "in split supersymmetry @xcite all sfermions together with one heavy higgs doublet have a large mass , which is taken for simplicity to be degenerate at the scale @xmath5 .    in this framework , since the effects of sfermions appear at very large scale , the hierarchy problem is not solved .",
    "it is argued that gauge unification is still achieved , and a dark matter candidate is still present ( the neutralino ) when r - parity is conserved .",
    "in addition , large flavour and cp violation are avoided .",
    "this type of model is supported by the fact the lhc collaborations do not see sfermions up to a mass near the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "split susy can be obtained from the mssm which includes two higgs doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the higgs potential in the mssm is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are soft mass parameters corresponding to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons , @xmath11 is the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter , and @xmath12 is the soft higgs mixing parameter ( with units of mass square ) .",
    "it is assumed that one higgs doublet , @xmath13 , remains light and resembles the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the second one , @xmath14 , is heavy and for simplicity its components have a degenerate mass equal to @xmath5 .",
    "this doublet comes from a mixing of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , given by @xmath15 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos\\alpha & -\\sin\\alpha \\cr \\sin\\alpha & \\cos\\alpha \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } h_u \\cr i\\sigma_2 h_d^ * \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] where the mixing angle @xmath16 is reminiscent of the mssm . in the decoupling limit of the mssm ( equivalent to the split supersymmetric case )",
    "we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 , under the usual conventions for the angles in the mssm @xcite . in ss ,",
    "the angle @xmath19 is such that there is no mixing between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the mass terms for the two doublets are @xmath20 gev and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the transition from the mssm to split susy is achieved by integrating out the heavy scalars by solving their equation of motion .",
    "for instance , the heavy higgs field can be replaced by @xmath21 \\widetilde h_d + \\frac{1}{\\widetilde m^2 } \\frac{s_\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2 } } i\\sigma_2 \\left [ g(\\sigma^*\\cdot\\overline{\\widetilde w})+g'\\overline{\\widetilde b } \\right ] \\overline{\\widetilde h_u }   + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the original proposal of split susy this scalar was also taken to be heavy , therefore the limit @xmath22 was invoked , which decouples completely the field @xmath14 . after replacing ( [ hss1 ] ) in the lagrangian of the mssm and after decoupling the heavy higgs ,",
    "the r - parity conserving part of the split supersymmetric lagrangian reads  @xcite @xmath23 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for simplicity we have called @xmath24 the sm higgs doublet .",
    "this lagrangian contains the mass and quartic parameters of the light higgs potential , the yukawa couplings , the gaugino mass parameters , the supersymetric higgsino mass parameter , and four higgs - gaugino - higgsino couplings @xmath25 , by - products of the decoupling of the scalars .",
    "the original split supersymmetric model can be extended by adding bilinear r - parity violating interactions , @xmath26 the terms proportional to @xmath27 come from the usual bilinear interaction , while the terms proportional to @xmath28 appear after integrating out the sleptons and retaining renormalizable operators  @xcite .",
    "at this point , since higher order terms have been neglected , all the terms of the effective low energy lagrangian are renormalizable ( indicated by the subscript @xmath29 ) . the neutralinos and neutrinos mix themselves by means of the following mass matrix , @xmath30 , \\label{f0massmat}\\ ] ] where the neutralino submatrix is given by @xmath31 , \\label{x0massmat}\\ ] ] and the mixing between neutralinos and neutrinos",
    "is defined by the submatrix , @xmath32.\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 is the vacuum expectation value of the light higgs field . if one defines @xmath34 and block - diagonalizes the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ f0massmat ] ) one obtains the well known effective neutrino mass matrix , @xmath35 , \\label{treenumass}\\ ] ] which gives the atmospheric neutrino mass scale . for notational purposes we call the matrix elements of this @xmath36 neutrino mass matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the situation with split supersymmetry is that one loop corrections give @xmath38 , this is , a term proportional to the tree level value .",
    "thus , loop contributions in ss do not induce a second neutrino mass scale . in the mssm with brpv",
    "something different happens , since loop contributions additionally induce a term proportional to @xmath39@xcite and in accordance with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to obtain a second mass scale in split supersymmetry",
    "one alternative is to include extra contributions which go beyond the original ss or mssm field content .",
    "for example an extra contribution from gravity has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we consider here a different alternative , namely the effect of neglected contributions from non - renormalizable operators that arise from the original mssm lagrangian .    before working out the relevant non - renormalizable terms , we mention the fact that in split supersymmetry the value of the light higgs mass near @xmath3 gev implies an upper bound on the scale @xmath5 of the order of @xmath40-@xmath41 gev @xcite , in other words , the value of the light higgs mass implies a rather low value of the split susy scale .",
    "like in the previous section , the starting point is the mssm lagrangian with the higgs potential ( [ higgspotmssm ] ) .",
    "however , now the integration of heavy scalars will not be truncated at the first contribution . for example , for the heavy higgs the equation of motion is given by eq .",
    "( [ hss1 ] ) . instead of sending @xmath42 which corresponds to simply erasing the @xmath14 from the lagrangian",
    "we now retain a finite ( but large ) value of @xmath43 and replace ( [ hss1 ] ) back into the lagrangian  ( [ higgspotmssm ] ) . in this way , new operators arise as as a consequence of the finite mass of the heavy scalars .",
    "one of those terms is @xmath44\\widetilde{h}_d                   \\right\\}^2 , \\label{nonrl}\\ ] ] which is a non - renormalizable dimension 8 operator ( from now on , the script @xmath45 refers to `` non - renormalizable '' ) .",
    "the value of the coupling is given at @xmath46 , and it leads to a neutrino mass contribution that will be developed in the next section .",
    "notice that the bilinear r - parity violating mixing in matrix ( [ f0massmat ] ) allows us to convert from a @xmath47 to a neutrino after block diagonalization @xcite .",
    "analogously one finds the following @xmath48 operator when integrating out down squarks @xmath49 similar operators appear after integrating out sleptons and the procedure invoked is the same ( although with small differences ) .",
    "these two kinds of operators ( [ nonrl],[eq : dsdnr ] ) will induce corrections that have been claimed to be , jointly with the neutralino - neutrino corrections , the largest contributions to the solar mass difference @xcite . notice that in order to write down a similar expression for the sleptons we just need to do the replacement : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and the subindex @xmath52 ( but not for @xmath47 ) .    in order to write down this last coupling , we perform the decoupling of squarks in the soft trilinear sector of the mssm instead the higgs potential , as we did with the @xmath0 operator ( [ nonrl ] ) . in the mssm",
    "this term allows us to write the down - sdown loop .",

    "<S> the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is able to explain the current data from neutrino physics . </S>",

    "<S> , it is shown how one can derive an effective low energy theory from the mssm in the spirit of split supersymmetry , which has the potential of explaining the neutrino phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by going beyond leading order in the process of integrating out heavy scalars from the original theory , which results in non - renormalizable operators in the effective low energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in particular a @xmath0 operator is crucial for the generation of the neutrino mass differences . </S>"
