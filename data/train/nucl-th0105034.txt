    "the isoscalar dipole mode , excited by the operator [ spur ] o=_i^a r_i^3y_1m(_i ) , is particularly interesting because it can give information on the compressibility of nuclear matter @xcite ( ref.@xcite contains a review of experimental and theoretical studies of the isoscalar dipole resonance ) .",
    "this information is complementary to that given by the monopole `` breathing '' mode @xcite .",

    "recent rpa calculations by two independent groups , using different prescriptions to eliminate the spurious c.m",
    ". strength , give somewhat contradictory results @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic isoscalar dipole strength function calculated in ref.@xcite typically shows two main peaks concentrated around @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the same feature is not shared by the strength functions calculated in @xcite , where the low - energy peak has been almost completely eliminated by the subtraction of the spurious strength .",
    "more recent calculations performed by other groups @xcite give results that are in qualitative agreement with those of ref . @xcite",

    "excitation from the physically interesting intrinsic excitation by using a semiclassical method based on the vlasov equation . in ref.@xcite ,",

    "response is treated correctly already in the starting zero - order approximation .",
    "*    the rpa ( including its relativistic generalizations @xcite ) is only one of the two main approaches that have been used to study the dipole compression mode , the other one being the fluid - dynamic approach @xcite .",
    "our present kinetic - theory approach can be viewed as intermediate between rpa and fluid dynamics .",
    "in this paper we need to evaluate the following kind of response functions : [ res ] _",
    "jk()= d*r * r^jy_1m(*r*)_k(*r * , ) , more specifically , we need the functions @xmath2 ( we put a tilde over the moving - surface response functions to distinguish them from the untilded fixed - surface ones ) . the fluctuation @xmath3 is the time fourier transform of the density fluctuation @xmath4 induced by an external field @xmath5 .",
    "this fluctuation can be obtained by integrating over momentum the phase - space density fluctuation @xmath6 that is given by the solution of the linearized vlasov equation , either with fixed - surface @xcite or with moving - surface @xcite boundary conditions : _ k ( * r*,t)=d*p*n_k(*r*,*p*,t ) .",
    "the solution of the linearized vlasov equation , both with fixed and moving surface , can be obtained at different levels of approximation .",

    "note that , while the zero - order approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to nucleons moving in the static equilibrium mean field and being reflected by the static equilibrium surface , the zero - order approximation of @xcite and @xcite does take into account partially the density fluctuations induced by the external driving force by considering particle reflections from a moving surface .",
    "thus , what has been called the zero - order approximation in @xcite includes more dynamics than the corresponding approximation of @xcite .    when working with a moving surface it is convenient to introduce a modified density fluctuation @xmath7 that is related to @xmath8 in the following way .",

    ". however we note that this simple result is obtained in a model that already has the correct translation - invariance property and that this procedure with @xmath38 can not be used as a general prescription for subtracting the spurious strength in non - translationally - invariant models .",
    "had we used this prescription within the fixed - surface model of ref @xcite , that can be taken as an example of a case in which the problem of spurious dissipation appears , we would have found [ eta ] = , but now the two response functions in the numerator and denominator are no longer proportional ( cf .",
    "eq.([fsr ] ) ) , and we would need a complex and @xmath28-dependent parameter @xmath33 to subtract the spurious strength .    in order to allow for a more quantitative appreciation of spurious effects , in fig.1 we show the zero - order response function calculated in the fixed - surface approximation of eq.([fsr ] ) , that is with no corrections for c.m .",
    "effects ( dotted curve ) , and the same response function calculated for the effective operator @xmath39 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "this effective operator drastically reduces the response ( by almost 90% for @xmath40 ) , but it leaves the intrinsic strength at the same energy of the uncorrected response .",
    "the solid curve in fig.1 instead shows the result of our present moving - surface model , to be discussed more extensively in the next section .",
    "the quantities plotted in this and in the two following figures are the strength functions @xmath41 , related to the respective response functions by @xmath42 . in the translation - invariant model",

    "after having shown that the model of ref.@xcite does not introduce any spurious dissipation at @xmath45 , we are now in a position to evaluate the nuclear response to the external field ( [ vex ] ) , without having to worry about spurious effects . the response function @xmath46 is given by eq.([a19 ] ) .",
    "this response function is qualitatively different from those discussed in the previous section .",

    "since @xmath64 ( for @xmath65 ) , while the phenomenological value used in @xcite was @xmath66 , we see that , already at the fermi - gas level , we have a resonable estimate for the mean excitation energy of the isoscalar dipole strength . what is unrealistic in the fermi gas model , is the pressure @xmath67 exerted by the nuclear fluid , but the incompressibility , defined as @xmath68 , happens to be within the range of @xmath69 compatible with the monopole data @xcite . in any case we can always change the compressibility of the system by switching on the residual interaction between nucleons .",
    "so far we have treated the nucleus like a gas of non - interacting fermions confined to a spherical cavity with perfectly reflecting walls that are allowed to move under the action of the gas pressure induced by the external field , taking into account the interaction between nucleons changes the compressibility of this nuclear fluid .    rather than embarking in numerical calculations , here",
    "we give only a simple estimate of the main effects that are expected when the nucleon - nucleon interaction is switched on and , in order to keep the analytic insight allowed for by our semiclassical approach , we assume a very schematic , separable , effective interaction of the dipole - dipole type : [ dip ] u(*r*,*r*)=_mr ry_1 m ( ) y_1m^*( ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 , determining the strength of the interaction , will be related to the compressibility , which is the relevant parameter in this context .",

    "the energy - weighted moment @xmath57 of this response function is still given by eq.([ews ] ) , as can be easily checked by studying the large-@xmath28 limit .",
    "thus we are confident that , even if the dipole - dipole residual interaction ( [ dip ] ) violates translation invariance , we are not introducing any spurious strength in our intrinsic response function ( [ collintr ] ) .",
    "contrary to the first moment @xmath55 , the inverse moment @xmath56 is altered by the residual interaction .",
    "this can be checked by evaluating the limit [ m-1 ] _ 0 _ intr()= -[1-_11 ^ 0(0 ) ] , where [ led ] r_11 ^ 0(0)=- .",
    "equation ( [ m-1 ] ) can be written as _ 0 _ intr()= - , with k=6_f .    by following exactly the same procedure for monopole vibrations ,",
    "for which we assume a monopole residual interaction of the kind u(r , r)=r^2  r^2 , we find an analogous expression for the monopole incompressibility : [ mcomp ] k_mon=6_f , where @xmath74 is the zero - frequency limit of the monopole response function , analogous to ( [ led ] ) .",
    "we can determine @xmath75 by comparison with the data on giant monopole resonances ( see table i ) and then , by assuming @xmath76 , we can study the dipole response .    in our simplified scheme for taking into account the residual interaction between nucleons ,",
    "we replace the fermi - gas intrinsic response function ( [ bella ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ collintr ] ) . thus eq.([collintr ] ) becomes our final expression for the intrinsic isoscalar dipole response function , it is a generalization of the confined - fermi - gas expression ( [ bella ] ) to a confined fluid of interacting nucleons with incompressibility @xmath62 .",
    "at first we treat @xmath62 as a free parameter and study its effect on the dipole response function , then we determine the value of @xmath62 by comparison with the monopole - resonance data and use this value to compare with the dipole - resonance data .",
    "the strength function associated with the response function ( [ collintr ] ) is shown in fig . 3 for three values of the incompressibility ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ) .",
    "when the system becomes softer , part of the strength shifts from the high - energy peak towards the low - energy peak , at about 13 mev in lead .",
    "the position of the two centroids is also slightly changed , but the main effect is the change in the relative weight of the two peaks.this behaviuor is similar to that found in the relativistic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the position of the peaks is also similar for comparable values of @xmath62 .",
    "however , unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not see any qualitative difference in the sensitivity of the two peaks to the compressibility of the system .",
    "we finally note that for @xmath79 the strength moves to higher energy .      in table",
    "i we report experimental centroid energies of the giant monopole resonance taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , together with our calculated values . a reasonable agreement with experiment",
    "is obtained for @xmath80 mev .    in fig.4",
    "we compare our enegy - weighted strength functions with the recent data of ref.@xcite for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the quantity plotted in the figure is y(e)=100e ( - _ intr(e))/m^1_intr , where @xmath84 is the excitation energy .",
    "the solid curve shows our confined - fermi - gas response , that is the energy - weighted isoscalar dipole strength for an assembly of non - interacting nucleons with incompressibility @xmath85 .",
    "our strength integrated up to @xmath86 exhausts about @xmath87 of the energy - weighted sum rule @xmath57 , while integrating up to @xmath88 exhausts about @xmath89 of the energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "it is important to note that the data overshoot this sum rule @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this overshooting are not clear to us , since , unlike the isovector dipole , no enhancement factor of the energy - weighted sum rule is expected in this case @xcite .",
    "the experimental finding of @xcite that the isoscalar dipole strength consists of two components is qualitatively reproduced by our semiclassical model ( at the fermi gas level the two resonances correspond to two complex zeroes of the function @xmath90 of eq.([closed])@xcite ) . in this respect",
    "our results are also in qualitative agreement with the quantal rpa calculations of @xcite and @xcite , that predict a two - resonance structure in the isoscalar dipole response .    for the confined fermi gas ( solid line )",
    "the position of the two peaks is too high in energy .",
    "taking into account the residual interaction ( dashed line ) improves the agreement with data , but does not completely remove the discrepancy , especially for the high - energy peak .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.4 has been calculated for @xmath91 mev , which has been determined by fitting the energy of the isoscalar monopole resonance within the same model .",
    "our value of @xmath62 lies at the lower end of the uncertainty range indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite and is somewhat smaller than the values reported in ref .",
    "however these values refer to saturated and symmetric ( @xmath92 ) nuclear matter .",
    "the small discrepancy is probably due to the fact that we are using a sharp - surface model , while of course experiments are performed on real nuclei that have a diffuse surface , thus our value of @xmath62 does not refer to the density in the interior of nuclei , but rather to some average density that takes into account surface diffuseness .",
    "also , in real nuclei @xmath93 is larger than @xmath94 and , as pointed out in @xcite , @xmath62 decreases with increasing asymmetry .    by comparing the two curves shown in fig.4",
    ", we can say that an attractive interaction between nucleons , that decreases the value of @xmath62 with respect to the initial value of @xmath95 , improves the agreement with data , but the position of the high - energy peak remains too high in energy , even for the rather small value @xmath96 , suggested by our fit to monopole data .",
    "further decrease of @xmath62 would shift the response towards lower energy and would redistribute the strength by enhancing the low - energy peak and depleting the high - energy one , moreover this would give too small values for the monopole - resonance centroid energies .",
    "the coupling of the two resonances in the isoscalar dipole response due to the residual interaction is a novel effect displayed by our calculation and , although the position of the peaks is not much affected by the compressibility , we find that the stregth associated with them is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath62 .",
    "another qualitative feature of the data that is well reproduced by our calculations is the @xmath97 dependence of the peak positions @xcite .",
    "actually , an interesting property of the response function ( [ collintr ] ) is that , if @xmath98 is independent of @xmath99 , then this quantity , like the functions @xmath100 , can be expressed in terms of a universal function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath52 defined in the appendix : [ sca ] _",
    "intr.(s)=n_33(a ) u(s ) .",
    "the function @xmath101 is the same for all spherical nuclei and its explicit expression can be easily derived from the equations given in the appendix .",
    "the mass number @xmath99 of the particular nucleus being studied enters only through the normalization factor _ 33(a)= and does not affect the position of the resonances in the variable @xmath52 . since @xmath102 , the scaling property ( [ sca ] ) of the response function ( [ collintr ] ) results in an @xmath97 dependence of the peak positions in excitation energy .    in conclusion ,",
    "our model is able to reproduce some of the features displayed by the data like the two - resonance structure of the response and the @xmath99-dependence of the peak position , but , even after an accurate subtraction of the spurious c.m .",
    "strength for which a new formula has been derived , it fails to reconcile the monopole and dipole data .",
    "this failure is shared by our semiclassical model with the quantal rpa calculations of ref.s @xcite and @xcite .",

    "it is convenient to use the dimensionless variable s= , where @xmath105 is the fermi velocity , we shall use also the fermi energy @xmath106 to characterise our systems .",
