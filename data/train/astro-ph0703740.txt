    "we briefly describe what we mean by quasar h  ii region , especially near the end of reionization .",
    "late in reionization , close to percolation , the h  ii region sizes grow rapidly .",
    "this is of course the expected behaviour , but it is not clear what meaning to attach to any given h  ii region when most of the universe is already ionized . for h  ii regions around very rare quasar host halos ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the central h  ii region in which the quasar forms is much larger than the surrounding h  ii regions .",
    "while the mean global ionized fraction may be high , the fluctuations in ionized fraction outside of the central h  ii region are likely to be on much smaller scales .      the variation in the size of _ pre - existing _ h  ii regions that surround quasars when they begin to shine manifests itself in a theoretical uncertainty in the determination of properties of quasars , such as their ionizing photon luminosity and age , as well as properties of the surrounding medium , such as the neutral fraction and gas density .",
    "for a quasar that has been on for a time @xmath42 and has an ionizing photon luminosity @xmath43 , the observed line - of - sight radius of its h  ii region , @xmath44 , is related to the radius of the h  ii region in which it initially lies , @xmath45 , by v=(r _",

    "[ robs ] , width=259 ]    what is the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath51 , given that the initial radius of the h  ii region , @xmath45 , is unknown ?",

    "[ robs ] for different values of @xmath44 . for larger observed h  ii regions , the overestimate of @xmath51 is smaller .",
    "if the ionizing luminosity and age of the quasar are known , as well as the density of the surrounding gas , then the neutral fraction can be determined according to 1-xx_hi=. of course , the luminosity , age , and density are not known exactly , but arguments can be made based upon their likely values ( e.g.  wyithe & loeb 2004a ) .",
    "the error in @xmath51 is related to an error in @xmath62 by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the neutral fraction inferred by assuming the quasar began to shine in a completely neutral medium . since @xmath65",
    ", the neutral fraction is always underestimated when the presence of existing h  ii regions is not taken into account .",
    "there are therefore two reasons why higher neutral fractions lead to smaller h  ii regions .",
    "first , higher neutral fractions lead to slower ionization fronts propagating away from the quasar and thus to smaller h  ii regions .",
    "second , the higher the neutral fraction , the smaller the pre - existing h  ii region , which also leads to a smaller observed h  ii region .",
    "fan  et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) define `` proximity zones '' as regions where the transmission is greater than ten percent , but do not explicitly associate them with the size of the quasar s h  ii region .",
    "these proximity zones have radii which increase steeply over the range @xmath66 , from @xmath67 to @xmath68 comoving mpc ( fig . [ fan ] ) .",
    "these values are similar to the size of h  ii regions around @xmath69-halos ( a likely minimum value for host halo masses of observed quasars at @xmath1 ; e.g. volonteri & rees 2006 ; li et al .  2006 ) near the end of reionization ( fig .",
    "[ halopanels ] ) .    shown also in fig .",
    "[ fan ] is the typical size of h  ii regions surrounding halos with masses @xmath70 for a model in which the ionized fraction reaches unity at @xmath71 and the integrated thomson scattering optical depth ( assuming once ionized helium ) is @xmath72 .",
    "the theoretical expectation for the evolution h  ii region sizes agrees quite well with the measured proximity zone sizes .",
    "this suggests that the evolving sizes of the proximity zones measured by fan  et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) can be explained by the growth of cosmic h  ii regions driven by clustered sources around the quasars alone .",
    "taking into account the contribution from the quasars could change the theoretical prediction , since the flux contributed by the quasar at distances greater than the size of the pre - existing bubble may be large enough to increase transmission there . for a quasar with a spectral shape @xmath73 ( e.g. , bolton & haenelt 2007 ) and ionizing photon luminosity @xmath74 , ionization equilibrium implies that the neutral fraction at a comoving distance @xmath75 is f_hi410 ^ -6 ( ) ^ ( ) ^2 ( ) ^-1 , while the neutral fraction necessary to obtain a gunn - peterson optical depth @xmath76 is given by ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , f_hi410 ^ -6 ( ) ( ) ^-3/2 . for reasonable igm clumping factors and quasar ionizing photon luminosities , therefore , the quasar by itself is able to cause transmission at a distance of 40 comoving mpc , very similar to the size of the transmission gaps of the highest redshift quasars measured by fan  et  al .",
    "thus , there are two possible explanations for the rapid increase in the size of the trasnmission gaps : 1 ) hii regions , defined as regions where hydrogen is mostly ionized , are much larger than the observed transmission gaps at @xmath77 .",
    "the transmission gaps correspond to smaller regions , within which the evolving uv intensity from a combination of nearby galaxies and the quasar ionizes the igm to a level sufficient to allow transmission , or 2 ) the transmission gaps correspond to the extent of the hii regions themselves , which grow rapidly as overlap takes place at @xmath1 .",
    "the uv background intensity within these hii regions is dominated by galaxies clustered around the central quasar and is sufficient to cause the observed transmission .",
    "halo vs. redshift for a model with @xmath78 and @xmath71 . also shown are the `` proximity zone '' radii ( triangles ) of sixteen quasars as determined by fan  et  al .",
    "the dotted lines are the ionized and neutral fractions multiplied by 100 .",
    "shown also is a linear fit ( long dashed ) of the proper size vs. redshift , as in fan  et  al .",
    "[ fan ] , width=268 ]",
    "we have used the conditional h  ii region size distribution around halos with a mass @xmath79 to model observations of quasar h  ii regions .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * due to the biased location of quasars , the h  ii regions that surround them just before they begin to emit ionizing radiation are likely to be large , with radii of order tens of mpc , even when the mean ionized fraction is of order thirty percent . * for observed quasar h  ii regions with sizes of order tens of mpc , it is difficult to determine the properties of the surrounding medium , due to uncertainties in the size of pre - existing h  ii regions  neutral fractions will be underestimated for a given quasar luminosity and lifetime .",
    "this effect is strongest for small observed h  ii regions around quasars late in the reionization epoch .",
    "* the observed transmission gaps around high - redshift quasars may have a direct correspondence to cosmic h  ii regions created by galaxies clustered around the central quasar .",
    "the steep increase in the transmission gap size at @xmath77 can be explained by the rapid growth of these h  ii regions at the epoch of overlap .",
    "we expect conclusion 1 to be generally true , but conclusions 2 and 3 require further explanation .    for conclusion 2",
    ", the situation is more complicated when quasar h  ii region sizes are obtained from transmission gaps in their spectra . in this case",
    ", effects such as a boost in the neutral hydrogen abundance due to clumping and ly@xmath3 absorption from the damping wing of neutral gas outside the h  ii region can cause the inferred h  ii region size to be smaller than it actually is ( bolton & haehnelt  2007 ; maselli et al .",
    "this underestimate leads to an overestimate of neutral hydrogen abundance for a given quasar luminosity and lifetime . neglecting the h  ii region created by the nearby galaxies and their progenitors , on the other hand ,",
    "leads to an underestimate of the neutral fraction .",
    "a natural question is which of these two competing effects is stronger .",
    "for example , maselli et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the physical radius corresponding to the transmission gap is about 40 percent larger than that of the h  ii region , which corresponds to an underestimate of its volume by a factor of 3 , and an overestimate of the neutral fraction by that same factor . in order to offset this effect",
    ", @xmath80 would be necessary .",
    "for example , the probability that a quasar surrounded by a 40 comoving mpc h  ii region will have @xmath80 is about 30 percent , for @xmath81 at @xmath82 with @xmath83  k , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . at earlier times and lower ionization fraction , @xmath84 and @xmath5 , the probability is only ten percent .",
    "the two competing effects are thus similar in magnitude when the ionized fraction is high , @xmath85 , but the `` apparent shrinking '' reported by maselli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is likely to dominate at earlier times , when @xmath86 .",
    "these estimates are quite uncertain , however ",
    "rarer sources and/or quasar hosts could make these probabilities higher by increasing the pre - existing bubble size , and more detailed calculations will be necessary to refine these estimates further .    for conclusion 3 to be valid ,",
    "it is necessary for the uv radiation field within ionized bubbles to keep the volume - averaged neutral fraction low enough to create the observed transmission gaps .",
    "this is plausible , since the uv radiation field near quasars is likely enhanced due to their biased environment ( e.g. , yu & lu 2005 ) , with a size approaching that of the mean free path imposed by lyman - limit systems ( @xmath87 comoving mpc at @xmath88 ; gnedin & fan 2006 ) .",
    "there have been recent suggestions that detection of large ( @xmath89 comoving mpc ) h  ii regions by 21cm tomography can reveal the locations of quasars and bright galaxies that just underwent an agn phase ( wyithe , loeb & barnes 2005 ; kohler et al .",
    "our results here suggest that large , h  ii regions may be visible at relatively low redshifts , @xmath90 , where foreground contamination of the 21cm observations is lowest .",
    "thus , the 21cm observations hold the most promise for descriminating between the two possible explantations for the evolution of transmission gap sizes discussed here . in addition , measurement of the sizes of h  ii regions around bright quasars by 21cm tomography , when combined with the conditional h  ii region size distribution , will provide powerful constraints on the theory of reionization and the nature of high - redshift quasars .    in our model",
    "the global ionized fraction is proportional to the collapsed fraction , so that the same ionizing efficiency is assigned to collapsed matter , regardless of halo mass , epoch , or environment . in such a model",
    ", the ionized fraction grows exponentially with time .",
    "the reionization history is likely to be more complex than this , especially in light of the optical depth measured by wmap .",
    "for example , self - regulated reionization , in which the lowest mass objects do not produce ionizing photons when they form within existing h  ii regions , can extend the reionization epoch , relieving the tension between a percolation at @xmath1 and the wmap value of @xmath91 ( haiman & bryan 2006 ; iliev et al .",
    "we note , however , that our best - fitting model to the evolution of the transmission gap sizes , in which overlap is complete at @xmath92 and @xmath72 , is in marginal agreement with the value obtained from wmap 3 year polarization data , @xmath93 ( spergel et al .",
    "this indicates that the level of early reionization demanded by the wmap measurement may be quite modest , while still allowing for a late overlap at @xmath94 .",
    "the fact that h  ii regions are likely to surround quasars before they begin to shine , and that their size will have a strong redshift dependence , are likely to be crucial in developing a more complete understanding of observations of the high redshift universe .",
