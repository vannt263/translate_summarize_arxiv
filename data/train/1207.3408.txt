    "the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit - qed ) studies the interaction between artificial atoms and artificial photons  @xcite , both of them implemented with the same technology : superconducting circuits cooled to millikelvin temperatures .",
    "a key feature of these systems is that , based on the same microscopic model , both the photonic degrees of freedom and the artificial atoms have similar energy scales and may interact very strongly .",
    "hence , they show effects which are beyond those explored in the optical domain .",
    "a paradigmatic example is the failure of the rotating wave approximation when the qubit - photon coupling approaches the qubit and photon energies  @xcite . aside from the development of qubits and the control of their interactions  @xcite ,",
    "circuit - qed has recently started to focus on photons themselves , mostly in the context of two different experimental configurations . in the first type of setups ,",
    "cavities are replaced with open transmission lines and propagating microwave photons that move and interact with localized qubits .",
    "this allows us to study one - dimensional artificial qed , atom - light interaction  @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite , causality  @xcite , quantum metamaterials @xcite and to implement photodetectors  @xcite and routers  @xcite . the other type of setups is based on polariton physics  @xcite : by coupling multiple cavity - qubit systems it is possible to build lattices on which dressed photons hop and interact , either attractively or repulsively , implementing hubbard type models or spin hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to well known models , such as a tonks - girardeau gas  @xcite , however the architecture based on superconducting cavities and josephson junctions also allows for the exploration of new phenomena , such as gauge fields and frustration  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we revisit the architecture of coupled superconducting cavities , designing a tunable coupling between nearest - neighbor resonators .",
    "this represents a major breakthrough for this type of systems , because the dynamical tunability of the resonator coupling makes it possible to engineer a huge variety of _ photon - photon _ interactions : from red and blue sidebands to gauge fields , passing through correlated photon hopping and kerr nonlinearities , or simply canceling the usual cross - talk between resonators .",
    "all these approaches are based on simple superconducting circuit elements , such as dc- and rf - squids .",
    "the setup that we have in mind consists of an array of linear resonators , connected through different types of josephson junction ( jj ) circuits [ cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : array ] ] .",
    "the fixed circuit structure is associated with static , geometry dependent capacitive and inductive couplings between the resonators , while those related to the josephson junction circuits can be tuned by an applied magnetic flux .",
    "most notably , the total coupling strength can be reduced and even completely suppressed as the coupling due to the josephson junction circuits can have opposite sign .    unlike previous proposals that rely on dispersive coupling via qubits  @xcite or through circulator - like elements  @xcite , the coupling scheme proposed here has the potential to be stronger  the coupling elements are galvanically coupled , as in ref .",
    "[ ]  , it is more robust against external perturbations ( charge noise ) and the geometry of the lattice is not tied to the coupling element .",
    "the coupling elements can be operated in two ways : i ) with a stationary configuration of magnetic fields that determines the associated coupling matrix between oscillator modes or ii ) with a periodic multicolor driving that allows for engineering arbitrary sideband interactions , @xmath0 between any two resonators , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with adjustable coupling strengths @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , our design achieves tunability in a regime in which the couplings are strong or ultra - strong  larger than the corresponding decay rates or comparable to the cavity frequencies , respectively  , regardless of other elements that may coexist with the cavities , such as qubits or magnetic impurities .    as potential applications of this work we would like to address two fields .",
    "the first one has been sketched above : by tuning the coupling between different cavities it is possible to tune the lattice topology , the coupling strength and even the phase of the hopping terms in polariton arrays .",
    "this nicely complements existing proposals which show how to tune the photon nonlinearity by manipulating the qubit inside the cavity  @xcite and gives access to effective gauge fields without relying on fragile coupling elements  @xcite .",
    "the second type of application points along the line of quantum information and the manipulation of continuous variable states . by means of the coupling circuits in this toolbox",
    "one may implement any nearest neighbor quadratic hamiltonian with any time dependence and geometry , as far as it is embeddable in a 2d manyfold .",
    "this can be used to implement interesting states , such as two - dimensional continuous variable gaussian states  @xcite , whose tomography could be supplemented by embedded qubits  @xcite or moving probes  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first part [ sect .",
    "[ sec : inductive ] ] we will study two superconducting resonators that are close together and subject to a mutual inductive and capacitive interaction . using the lagrangian quantization , we will show that , both in the weak and strong coupling regime , the geometric crosstalk gives rise to a constant beam - splitter type interaction .",
    "in the second part of this work ( sect .  [ sec : effective ] ) we propose two quantum circuits that dynamically tune the inductive coupling between the resonators .",
    "the first one is a squid which is galvanically coupled to two resonators .",
    "the second one uses instead two coupling wires , creating an interference device between resonators .",
    "we will discuss analytically both models , demonstrating that they can tune and switch off the overall resonator - resonator coupling . in sec .",

    "[ sec : sidebands ] we consider the situation of a time - dependent resonator coupling .",
    "we show that a periodic modulation of the coupling makes it possible to engineer sidebands in a non - perturbative fashion , controlling the strength and phase of both the rotating and counterrotating terms . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and suggest a large set of potential applications , ranging from quantum information to quantum simulation .",
    "in this section we derive the hamiltonian that rules the dynamics of two coupled superconducting strip line resonators , and give a general expression for the different coupling constants that arise from the model .",
    "firstly we will consider the simplest case of coupling , caused by the mutual inductance and mutual capacitance due to the spatial proximity of the resonators .",
    "since the coupling is time independent and determined by the detailed spatial arrangement of the resonators , we refer to it as static geometric coupling .",
    "the discussion of this interaction is done for a particular configuration of parallel resonators , but the objective is just to exemplify how this coupling manifests itself as a beam - splitter interaction .    .",

    ", the interaction term gives rise to off - diagonal terms , as expected from an interaction between two cavities , but also diagonal terms that induce a renormalization ( dressing ) of the oscillator frequencies .",

    "we finally proceed with the quantization of this model , introducing the oscillator length @xmath27 .",
    "we express the phase space operators in terms of the fock operators , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to , @xmath30 the coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 account for the static capacitive and inductive contributions to the coupling , respectively , @xmath33    the usual limits in quantum optics correspond to the weak coupling and strong coupling regimes . in both of them",
    "@xmath34 , so that the frequency renormalization becomes negligible ( provided that @xmath35 ) .",
    "we can then invoke the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and transform ( [ quant_ham ] ) to the beam splitter model ,    @xmath36    note how the resulting hamiltonian can be interpreted as an exchange or _ hopping _ of excitations between modes , similar to optical lattice and tight - binding models .",
    "this type of static geometric coupling is implicit in the experimental configurations of coupled cavity models  @xcite , though previous designs have inclined to consider a capacitive coupling taking place at the electric field nodes ( current anti - nodes ) of the resonator  @xcite , sometimes enhanced by an additional jj circuit  @xcite .",
    "in this section we study alternative mechanisms for coupling two or more linear resonators . on the one hand we aim at a larger coupling strength , and on the other hand we wish to achieve real - time tunability of the couplings . for both goals",
    "it will be advantageous to rely on inductive rather than capacitive coupling .",
    "first of all , the inductive coupling realized by jjs and loops intersected by jjs ( e.g. squids ) can be tuned by an applied magnetic field varying the magnetic flux threading the jjs or loops .",
    "second , and equally important , inductive interactions can be enhanced , profiting both from the kinetic inductance of thin superconducting films and from embedded junctions working in the linear regime  @xcite .",
    "based on the two previous ideas , we envision the two coupling elements sketched in fig .  [ setup_beam ] .",
    "we will study analytically these designs , deriving expressions for the effective interactions and coupling strengths .          given the large inductance provided by the josephson junctions",
    ", one could naively think of connecting both cavities with a superconducting wire interrupted by a josephson junction .",
    "in doing so one would achieve a static ultrastrong coupling .",
    "however , for tuning the josephson inductance of a single junction we have to generate a magnetic flux of the order of a flux quantum threading the junction area . due to the small junction area unpractically large magnetic fields",
    "would be required .",
    "fortunately , we can design a much better tunability by using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) configuration , as depicted in figure  [ setup_beam]a .",
    "since the squid loop area is much larger than the junction area , much smaller control fields are required .",
    "note that even though the use of dc - squids as tunable couplers was already suggested for flux qubits  @xcite , our setup works with continuous variables and has subtle differences that need to be discussed below .    a short line with the squid represents a small contribution to the original lagrangian density  ( [ density_lag ] ) , that is @xmath37 with@xmath38 where , @xmath39 represent the flux differences along the junctions @xmath40 .",
    "we use fluxoid quantization along the squid loop , @xmath41 , to express the lagrangian in terms of the variables @xmath42 and the total flux enclosed by the loop , @xmath43 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath44 , that is , we are neglecting the additional flux generated by the circulating loop current .",
    "this is equivalent to restricting our discussion to screening parameters @xmath45 as discussed in more detail below . here",
    ", @xmath46 is the loop inductance and @xmath47 the critical current of the josephson junctions .",
    "if the squid is symmetric , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the coupling becomes @xmath50 , with an effective josephson coupling energy that depends on the flux threading the squid loop , @xmath51 the voltage - phase relation @xmath52 allows us to express @xmath53 in terms of the voltages at the edges of the connecting wire . in the linear limit of small fluxes , i.e. small photon number [ cf .",
    "[ ap : b ] ] , we can write a quadratic coupling between fields @xmath54 which by means of the normal mode decomposition adopts the form of eq .",
    "( [ quant_ham ] ) .",
    "the tunability of this model relies on the fact that the josephson energy @xmath55 is flux - dependent .",
    "this implies that @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jc ] ) can be changed in magnitude and sign . for an appropiate value of the external flux ( close to @xmath57 if @xmath58 ) we can fully deactivate the coupling .",
    "we finally notice that our setup is robust against small differences in the two junction energies , @xmath59 . in this case",
    "one can still expand @xmath60 , linearizing around @xmath61 to obtain @xmath62 the linear term in this equation amounts just to a displacement of the oscillators and does not add up to the total coupling , preserving the tunability of the setup .",
    "we will use this idea in the following setup .",
    "the second design is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup_beam]b .",
    "it consists of a superconducting ring interrupted by a single josephson junction .",
    "since both resonators share a branch of the loop that couples them , the lagrangian acquires new contributions with the kinetic inductance of the superconductor  @xcite .",
    "this kinetic coupling can be very strong , while still retaining the switching capability due to the fluxoid quantization inside the loop , similar to previous designs for superconducting qubits  @xcite .",
    "our derivation is based on two non - essential constraints .",
    "the first one is that the loop is small enough to neglect its self inductance ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the second one is that the wire without junction touches the resonators at points where the flux of the coupled modes is zero   and neglecting the phase drop along the connecting wires compared to that across the josephson junction . in this case",
    "the fluxoid quantization in the loop reads @xmath64 .",
    "the former assumption can always be made since the current flowing in the resonator only depends on the spatial derivative of the phase and not on its absolute value .",
    "the latter is a good approximation as long as the josephson inductance is large compared to the kinetic inductance of the wires .",
    "this is the case as long as the superconducting wire is not made extremely narrow . ]",
    "@xmath65 . under these circumstances",
    "the coupling term reads @xmath66 the fluxoid quantization inside the loop , @xmath67 , allows us to get rid of the flux variable @xmath68 and rewrite the coupling in terms of the branch fluxes @xmath69 , @xmath70.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point we will repeat the linearization of the cosine , much like in  ( [ eq : linearized - squid ] ) .",
    "however , now the taylor expansion will depend on the external flux , @xmath71 , producing linear and quadratic contributions of different magnitude .",
    "we start with the normal mode decomposition of the branch fluxes and restrict ourselves to the lowest energy modes @xmath72 introducing these terms in the interaction produces the quadratic lagrangian for the fundamental modes , @xmath73 the expressions for all coefficients can be computed from first principles @xmath74 out of these terms , @xmath75 is a linear displacement of the cavity eigenmodes and does not transfer energy .",
    "the capacitive and inductive terms , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are the only ones that contribute to the inter - cavity coupling , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and to the frequency renormalization .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the model  ( [ quant_ham ] ) with mode frequency @xmath78 and coupling strengths @xmath79 in general we will find that for a junction that works in the flux regime the term @xmath77 dominates all other contributions .",
    "but even without this assumption , it is true that while @xmath31 is fixed , the value of @xmath32 depends entirely on @xmath77 and can be changed in magnitude and sign , either enhancing the strength of the beam - splitter coupling  ( [ eq : jc ] ) , or switching it off entirely for a value of @xmath80 .",
    "while the coupling strength grows with the loop size , @xmath81 , we can not make it arbitrarily large because then we are no longer allowed to neglect the additional flux @xmath82 caused by the circulating loop current due to the increasing value @xmath46 of the self - inductance of the loop@xcite . in this case the total flux threading the loop is given by the sum of the external flux @xmath83 and the flux @xmath84 .",
    "however , as explained in ref .",
    "[ ] chapter 8.4 , provided that @xmath85 we can ensure that the @xmath43 versus @xmath83 dependence is single - valued allowing us full tunability of the coupling .",
    "this condition means that the maximum loop current @xmath47 can not generate more than a single flux quantum .",
    "it restricts ourselves to loop sizes of around the @xmath86 of the resonator length .",
    "we will now study various methods to increase the coupling strength while preserving the condition above .",
    "we are interested in an upper bound for the coupling strength `` @xmath87 '' .",
    "more precisely we would like to access both the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes .",
    "strong coupling means that it is possible to observe rabi oscillations between both cavities because the coupling @xmath87 is larger than the resonator decay rate , @xmath88 . on the other hand , ultrastrong coupling",
    "occurs when the rwa fails , which in this case implies that the number of photons in the ground state , that is proportional to @xmath89 , approaches one .",
    "looking at the first proposal [ cf .",
    "[ setup_beam]a and sect .",
    "[ sect : squid - coupler ] ] we note that the maximum coupling is reached for an external flux @xmath90",
    "threading the squid loop , and thus yielding @xmath91 where @xmath47 is the critical current of the junction , @xmath92 is the resonator impedance , and the eigenmode @xmath93 satisfies @xmath94 . to preserve the power field expansion ,",
    "we suppose the squid to be built at a position such that @xmath95 [ see sect .",
    "[ subsec : hopping ] ] .",
    "under this condition , and using a critical current @xmath96 , together with @xmath97 , it would be possible to reach a coupling strength up to @xmath98 .    on the other hand , for the second proposal [ cf .",
    "[ setup_beam]b and sect .",
    "[ sect : ring ] ] the coupling ( [ coupling ] ) in the loop becomes @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "for a homogeneous resonator ( see ( [ ap : single ] ) ) , we can straightforwardly assess the slope of @xmath101 , finding an exact expression for @xmath87 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the characteristic charging frequency of the resonator , and @xmath20 the first - mode frequency .",
    "using available values for nb striplines and junction parameters , we find that the homogeneous resonator remains in the weak coupling regime , as we envision before . for a loop size @xmath105 of @xmath106 of the resonator length , we obtain @xmath107 which represents @xmath108 of the resonator frequency @xmath109 [ see fig .  [ couplingrates ] ] .    adding a constriction to the central part of the resonator increases the field slope and thus the coupling .",
    "to this end , for a suitable nb inhomogeneous transmission line resonator  @xcite , this enhances the coupling up to @xmath110 , or equivalently to @xmath111 of the resonator frequency [ fig .",
    "[ couplingrates ] red - dashed ] .",
    "finally , the coupling can be further enhanced by interrupting the transmission line with a josephson junction . due to the presence of the junction",
    ", the flux eigenmode presents a constant phase slip @xmath112 at @xmath113 , which depends on the josepshon coupling energy of the junction@xcite .",
    "this additional phase jump enhances the coupling as follows @xmath114 optimal parameters for the junction attached to the resonator ( @xmath115 ) could lead to extremely large couplings of around @xmath116 ( @xmath117 of @xmath109 ) .",
    "so far we have discussed the possibility of tuning the coupling strength between two resonators , constructing a classical switch that allows us to control the exchange of photons . in this section",
    "we discuss a second type of tunability , which consists of engineering an arbitrary linear coupling type between two resonators : @xmath118 represented by the fock operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this would enlarge the applicability of our setup , extending it to the realization of almost any quadratic model with nearest neighbor interactions .    in order to demonstrate that this is possible",
    "we start our discussion by noting that both the dc - squid and the ring coupler provide us with a flux - dependent coupling @xmath119 if we now engineer the two resonators to have very different frequencies , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , a static coupling @xmath122 will be effectively suppressed , giving rise to a small dispersive term @xmath123 however , if we allow for a two - tone driving of the coupling @xmath124 & = & g_1 \\cos[(\\omega_b-\\omega_a)t+\\phi_1 ] + \\\\   & + & g_2 \\cos[(\\omega_a+\\omega_b)t+\\phi_2],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then this driving effectively activates the rotating and counter - rotating terms , with the phases given above . to show this we switch to an interaction picture with respect to the two harmonic oscillators @xmath125 the oscillating terms in eq .",
    "( [ g - t ] ) will precisely cancel the ones in the previous time - dependent hamiltonian , leaving back some other non - resonant terms which only act in higher - order perturbation theory , @xmath126 .",
    "the result should be the desired combination of sidebands @xmath127    it is worth mentioning that the previous sideband engineering is not perturbative : while we still need to impose that @xmath128 , the resulting coupling is larger than the dispersive term .",
    "another very important feature is that this method allows us to control the phase of the rotating and counterrotating terms , for this is related to the phase of the two - tone driving .",
    "as we discuss below , this is a very important property , as it allows us to implement effective gauge fields that control the hopping of photons between resonators .",
    "moreover , we achieve this effect by a simple driving of a standard squid , without the need of time - reversal breaking circuits which might be very sensitive to other noise sources  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "even though the realization of the time dependence  ( [ g - t ] ) might seem very complicated , in practice we do not need to tune the flux in a very complicated manner .",
    "a simple driving of @xmath129 , when introduced in the sinusoidal coupling  ( [ g - dependence ] ) , @xmath130 produces , via the jacobi - anger expansion @xmath131 in terms of the bessel functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "this series contains the basic driving plus higher harmonics which will be spectrally suppressed in the coupling term .",
    "alternatively , a suitable dependence for @xmath71 can be engineered with around 0.1 ns resolution using appropriate signal generators .",
    "again , out of this signal only the resonant terms , with frequencies around @xmath134 will contribute to the coupling .",

    "we have the potential to introduce new interactions between resonators , which are now of higher order and include on - site nonlinearities , @xmath142 , nearest - neighbor attractive or repulsive interactions , @xmath143 , photon - pair hopping , @xmath144 , etc [ cf .",
    "app  [ sec : nonlinear ] ] . out of these terms",
    "some are already strongly suppressed because of being off - resonant ; this is the case for interactions with odd powers , such as @xmath145 .",
    "the kerr nonlinearities will always be present and give rise to extended bose - hubbard physics .",
    "finally , the correlated hopping terms , @xmath144 , can be resonantly enhanced using the same technique that we employ for the sidebands : introducing a frequency mismatch between neighboring cavities and driving with exactly the frequency which is needed to select this process , @xmath146 .",
    "with all these tools we envision the possibility of engineering very interesting models , such as a condensate of pairs of photons  @xcite , which are very hard to engineer in other systems .",
    "summing up , in this work we have studied two different ways to engineer the coupling between superconducting resonators : one is geometric and static in nature , while the other relies on nonlinear coupling circuits and can be easily tuned in and out of the strong coupling regime .",

    "consider the lumped element model depicted in figure  [ fig : lumped]b .",
    "the discrete modes of the electromagnetic field inside the strips are described as arrays of @xmath172 oscillators , together with the mutual inductances and capacitances , representing the crosstalk . by applying the current conservation law at each node of the circuit",
