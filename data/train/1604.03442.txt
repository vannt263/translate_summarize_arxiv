    "semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) @xcite provide a clean medium for carrier confinement and confined spin manipulation by electric fields .",
    "the latter is made possible due to the spin - orbit interaction @xcite that translates the electron motion in space to the rotation of its spin .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in cnts is strong @xcite and originates from activation of the atomic spin - orbit coupling accompanying the folding of the graphene plane into a tube @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction governs the spin - valley structure of the states near the charge neutrality point in both the conductance and the valence bands @xcite forming spin - valley doublets separated by an energy gap known as zero - field splitting @xcite .",
    "the doublets that can serve as qubits , the absence of the dephasing @xcite due to the nuclear spin field , and the strong spin - orbit coupling make the cnts interesting for quantum information storage and processing @xcite .",
    "the spin transitions in quantum dots ( qds ) are monitored experimentally via the spin - valley blockade @xcite of the current flow across the double dot system .",
    "the current blockade is lifted by the electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) driven by ac external voltages @xcite for resonant frequencies .",
    "a large amount of theoretical work was performed for the description of the charge configuration with a single electron per dot ( 1e,1e ) .",
    "in particular , the spin - valley blockade in the presence of a short - range disorder was discussed @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of the confined states in the presence of the spin - orbit coupling were analyzed @xcite .",
    "the spin dephasing due to the hyperfine interaction with @xmath2c atoms was discussed for charge dynamics in a ( 0,2e)@xmath3(1e,1e ) cycle @xcite .",
    "the leakage current across pauli - blocked double dots in straight @xcite and bent @xcite cnt was also studied .",
    "nevertheless , in cnts the edsr was observed only for ambipolar double dots @xcite , with a single electron occupying a @xmath0-type dot and a single hole stored in the @xmath1-type dot . in the present work",
    "this charge configuration is denoted as ( 1e,1h ) .",
    "the edsr transition spectra were recently analyzed @xcite in a continuum description that produced good agreement with the experiment for model parameters with realistic values . to the best of our knowledge ref .",
    "@xcite was the only theoretical paper to consider the ( 1e,1h ) system in cnt double dots . in ( 1e,1h )",
    "the spin - valley structures of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dots are not identical . moreover , a strong tunnel coupling between the dots is difficult to obtain , since for the coupling to appear the conduction - band electron of the @xmath0 dot has to climb the potential maximum forming the @xmath1 dot @xcite .",
    "the tunnel coupling in turn is necessary for the exchange @xcite interaction to appear .        in this paper",
    "we determine the electronic structure of the ( 1e,1h ) charge configuration of the double qd using the tight - binding approach and the exact diagonalization method for the problem of a few carriers localized in states near the neutrality point .",
    "we account for the spin - orbit interaction of the orbital type .",
    "the present approach due to its atomistic nature describes all the intervalley scattering effects @xcite that result from the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the tunnel coupling between the carriers of @xmath0- and @xmath1-type qds as well as the deformations of the cnt axis are also accounted for at the atomic level .",
    "we discuss the spin - valley symmetry of states in the low - energy part of the spectrum and analyze the effects of the exchange interaction for the electronic structure near the ground - state of the ( 1e,1h ) system .",
    "we calculate the energies of transitions that unblock the pauli blockade and demonstrate their essential dependence on the deflection of the cnt axis .",
    "a bend in a cnt translates the strongly anisotropic effective land @xmath4 factor into a position dependent effective magnetic field which was indicated earlier @xcite as a prerequisite for driving the spin transition by edsr .",
    "the original model @xcite of the bend and the subsequent ones @xcite assumed that the deflection of the cnt does not change along each of the qds .",
    "however , in the experiments the cnt axis is bent due to its deposition above the metal gates @xcite .",
    "the model applied in this paper accounts for corrections to the spin - orbit interaction stemming from the local deflection of the cnt axis @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling sets the spins of the eigenstates near the neutrality point aligned parallel or antiparallel to the axis of the cnt .",
    "we study the consequences of the bent axis on the resonant transition energies lifting the pauli blockade , in particular for their dependence on the orientation of the external magnetic field .",
    "the details of the bend drastically change the dependence of the transition energies for the magnetic field rotated off the cnt axis .",
    "only when the bent parts of the cnt are above the metallic gates inducing the qd potentials a good qualitative agreement of the calculated transition spectrum to the experiment data is obtained .",

    "moreover , in the excited triplet of the ( 1e,1h ) system the spin - unpolarized state has a spatially antisymmetric wave function only for @xmath72 , and for @xmath164 the spin - valley and spatial wave functions separately do not possess a well - defined symmetry with respect to the electrons interchange .",
    "we have discussed the transitions lifting the spin - valley pauli blockade in the double dot , identifying two pairs of transition lines split at @xmath72 by an energy gap of the order of 0.1 mev in agreement with the experimental data .",
