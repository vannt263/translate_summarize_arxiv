    "singular spectrum analysis ( ssa ) is a nonparametric and adaptive decomposition of a time series . in the ssa",
    ", the original time series is separated into arbitrary number of additive components which are grouped and are interpreted as the slowly varying trend , oscillatory and noise components , respectively .",
    "it has been applied to many different fields from physics and earth sciences to financial and social sciences [ 2 - 7 ] .    in the conventional treatment of ssa ,",
    "the algorithm consists of four steps :    * 1st step : a time series @xmath1 of length @xmath2 is transformed into multidimensional series by constructing the @xmath3 trajectory matrix @xmath4 . where @xmath0 is the window length which is an arbitrary positive integer satisfying @xmath5 and @xmath6 . *",
    "2nd step : the singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix @xmath7 * 3rd step : so - called grouping procedure where the above set of rank - one matrices @xmath8 is partitioned into several groups .",
    "* 4th step : reconstruction process where the decomposition of the time series is completed with the anti - diagonal averaging of the grouped matrix @xmath9 which transform @xmath10 into hankel form .",
    "the major objective of the ssa algorithm is to separate the original time series into interpretable set of time series .",
    "a single parameter , window length @xmath0 , is involved in the algorithm and the results of decomposition depend on the choice of this parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these points are throughly discussed from the _ separability _ point of view [ 3,4 ] . it is argued that the relatively large window lengths are preferable to achieve a better ( weak ) separation , but for the series with a complex structure , too large window length leads to undesirable decomposition or mixture of the series components .",
    "then , how to choose the proper window length @xmath0 is an important point for the practical application of ssa but is not easy to formulate in a general way .",
    "the choice of the window lengths have been done so far by investigating the behavior of the eigentriples ( singular values , and left and right singular vectors of the trajectory matrix ) or the w - correlation matrix .    in this paper ,",
    "based on the filtering interpretation of ssa [ 1,8,10,12 ] , the decomposition of the power spectrum for the original time series is shown to be possible and this gives us detailed information about the spectral structure of the ssa decomposition . in the filtering interpretation , the ssa algorithm can be seen as the generation of normalized and complete set of adaptive filters and the operation of these filters to the original data .",
    "the ssa decomposition is thus interpreted as the soft and the optimal partitioning of the fourier space through the adaptively constructed filters . by utilizing the completeness property of the eigenvectors of the lagged - covariance matrix ,",
    "the filters constructed with these eigenvectors are used for the decomposition of the power spectrum of an original time series .",
    "the decomposition of the power spectrum shows the detailed structure of the ssa decomposition and , with this , we can obtain useful information about the spectral structure of the ssa decomposition and this helps us to choose the proper window length @xmath0 in the practical application .    in the next sec .",
    "2 , we briefly summarize the conventional treatment of the ssa algorithm .",
    "we also describe the filtering interpretation of the ssa and it is adopted for the decomposition of the power spectrum of original time series . in sec . 3 , in order to see how the decomposition of the power spectrum works , we have examined two cases : the schematic time series with the superposition of the pure harmonic components and the daily currency exchange rates of eur / usd .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the ssa algorithm . in the filtering interpretation ,",
    "the ssa algorithm consists of two steps .",
    "first , optimal and adaptive construction of the normalized and complete set of filters through the eigenvectors of the lagged - covariance matrix .",
    "second step is the operation of these filters to the original time series . in the conventional treatment of the ssa",
    ", these two procedures are mixed into the singular value decomposition and the anti - diagonal averaging procedure . because of the completeness property of the filters generated in ssa , not only the time series but also the power spectrum can be decomposed into arbitrary number of _ additive _ components . in order to show this , we assume the periodic boundary condition for the time series to avoid subtleties coming from the starting or the end points of a time series .",
    "let us consider a real - valued time series @xmath11 of sufficient length .",
    "first , we define the @xmath3 trajectory matrix @xmath4 as @xmath12 where window length @xmath0 is the arbitrary positive integer satisfying @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "next step is the singular value decomposition of the above trajectory matrix @xmath4 . to do this , the lagged - covariance matrix @xmath13 is introduced and the eigenvalue equation is solved @xmath14 the eigenvalues @xmath15 are ordered as the decreasing order of magnitude @xmath16 and the corresponding eigenvectors are denoted as @xmath17",
    "we define the @xmath18 dimensional vector as @xmath19 .",
    "then the @xmath3 rank - one matrices @xmath8 are expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "then the singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix is expressed as @xmath21 the third step is the partitioning of the matrices @xmath8 into several groups and is called as the grouping procedure .",
    "the fourth step is the reconstruction of the time series . for the grouped matrix @xmath9",
    ", we carry out the anti - diagonal average which transform @xmath10 into hankel form .",
    "then the time series are reconstructed giving the ssa decomposition .      as are discussed in refs .",
    "[ 8,10 - 12 ] , above mentioned ssa algorithm can be viewed as the two - step point - symmetric filtering of the time series .",
    "the filtering interpretation is much more transparent in fourier space , and the normalization and the completeness properties of the filters play a crucial role in ssa decomposition . to see this",
    ", we define the discrete fourier transform as @xmath22 and @xmath23 where the components of the vector @xmath17 is denoted as @xmath24 . in above eq.([eq6 ] ) , we consider the fourier transform of the series of length @xmath18 @xmath25 and then the sum @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 .    the forward filtering @xmath28 can be rewritten in the fourier space as @xmath29 the above relation holds for the periodic series .",
    "since the eigenvectors @xmath30 are real valued , their fourier transform satisfies @xmath31 . in above equation , the vectors @xmath32 are complex in general , and shift and distort the time series . the non - causal fir filtering eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) corresponds to the svd of the trajectory matrix in the conventional treatment of ssa .",
    "the last step of ssa is the anti - diagonal averaging ( hankelization ) for the rank - one matrix @xmath8 and this can be expressed as the causal fir filtering @xmath33 then the two - step filtering can be combined as a single real filtering @xmath34 and does not distort the time series [ 1,9,10,12 ]",
    ". it should be important to note that the orthonormal and the completeness properties of the eigenvector @xmath17 lead to the following relations for the filters @xmath35 [ 10,11 ] @xmath36 and @xmath37 an arbitrary orthonormal @xmath0-dimensional vector set @xmath38 leads to the filters satisfying the relations eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) . in the ssa ,",
    "the specific @xmath0-dimensional vectors @xmath39 are adopted which maximize the norm of the @xmath18-dimensional vector @xmath28 preserving the orthonormality of the vectors @xmath39 , which leads to the eigenvalue equation eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors for the lagged - covariance matrix @xmath40 , the following relation holds @xmath41 the ssa can be interpreted as an algorithm to determine the orthonormal @xmath0-dimensional vectors @xmath17 which maximize the quantity @xmath42 preserving the orthonormality of the vectors * v*. in this sense",
    ", the the ssa can be understood as the principal component analysis applied to the trajectory matrix constructed from the lagged vectors .",
    "the orthogonality of the eigenvectors are preserved as the phase content for @xmath32 , and then , it is lost for the filters @xmath43 .",
    "instead of loosing the orthogonality , the filters @xmath43 are real valued and lead no phase shift or distortion for the time series [ 1,9,10,12 ] .",
    "the ssa decomposition of the time series can simply be expressed as @xmath44 we denote the inverse fourier transform of the component @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "then , the ssa decomposition of the time series is expressed as @xmath47 for later convenience , we denote the filters as @xmath48 and the eqs .",
