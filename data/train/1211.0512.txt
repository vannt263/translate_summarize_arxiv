    "a successful model of baryogenesis can not be realised within the standard model ( sm ) and , therefore , the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe can be regarded as an evidence for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing in neutrino oscillation experiments in 1998 @xcite has for the first time shown directly , in particle physics experiments , that the sm is indeed incomplete , since it strictly predicts , in the limit of infinite cutoff , that neutrinos are massless and , therefore , can not oscillate .",
    "this discovery has greatly raised the interest for leptogenesis @xcite , a model of baryogenesis that is a cosmological consequence of the most popular way to extend the sm in order to explain why neutrinos are massive but at the same time much lighter than all the other fermions : the seesaw mechanism  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", leptogenesis realises a highly non - trivial link between two completely independent experimental observations : the absence of primordial antimatter in the observable universe and the observation that neutrinos mix and ( therefore ) have masses .",
    "in fact , leptogenesis has a naturally built - in double - sided nature .",
    "on one side , it describes a very early stage in the history of the universe characterised by temperatures @xmath0 , much higher than those probed by big bang nucleosynthesis , @xmath1@xmath2 ; on the other side , it complements low - energy neutrino experiments providing a completely independent phenomenological tool to test models of new physics embedding the seesaw mechanism .    in this article",
    "we review the main features and results of leptogenesis .",
    "let us give a brief outline . in section 2 we present the status of low - energy neutrino experiments measuring neutrino masses and mixing parameters , and we introduce the seesaw mechanism , which provides an elegant framework to explain them . in section 3",
    "we discuss the vanilla leptogenesis scenario . in section 4",
    "we show the importance of accounting for flavour effects for a correct calculation of the final asymmetry . in section 5",
    "we discuss the density matrix formalism which properly takes into account decoherence effects , which are crucial to describe the transition from a one - flavoured regime to a fully flavoured regime .",
    "in section 6 we relax the assumption of hierarchical right - handed neutrino mass spectrum , and discuss how the asymmetry can be calculated in the degenerate limit . in section 7",
    "we discuss different ways to improve the kinetic description beyond the density matrix formalism . in section 8",
    "we discuss other effects ( thermal corrections , spectator processes , scatterings ) that have been considered and that can give in some cases important corrections . in section 9",

    "neutrino oscillation experiments have established two fundamental properties of neutrinos .",
    "the first one is that the neutrinos mix .",
    "this means that the neutrino weak eigenfields @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) do not coincide with the neutrino mass eigenfields @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) but are obtained applying to them a unitary transformation described by the @xmath7 leptonic mixing matrix @xmath8 , _ = _",

    "a global analysis @xcite of all existing neutrino data , prior to the results of a non - vanishing @xmath10 from short baseline reactors , gives @xmath17 for the solar mixing angle , @xmath18 for the atmospheric mixing angle , and @xmath19 for the reactor mixing angle , where the latter is mainly dominated by the evidence for a non - vanishing @xmath10 found by the t2k experiment @xcite that confirmed previous hints @xcite .",
    "recently , the daya bay and reno short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments respectively found @xmath20 @xcite , and @xmath21 @xcite , confirming , at more than @xmath22 , the previous results .",
    "the second important property established by neutrino oscillation experiments is that neutrinos are massive .",
    "more specifically , defining the three neutrino masses in a way that @xmath23 , neutrino oscillation experiments measure two mass - squared differences that we can indicate with @xmath24 and @xmath25 since historically the first one has been first measured in atmospheric neutrino experiments and the second one in solar neutrino experiments .",
    "two options are currently allowed by previous experiments .",
    "a first option is ` normal ordering ' ( no ) and in this case m_3 ^ 2 - m^2_2 = m^2_atm m_2 ^ 2 - m^2_1 = m^2_sol , while a second option is represented by ` inverted ordering ' ( io ) and in this case m_3 ^ 2 - m^2_2 = m^2_sol m_2 ^ 2 - m^2_1 = m^2_atm .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the atmospheric neutrino mass scale @xmath26 and the solar neutrino mass scale @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not sufficient to fix all three neutrino masses . if we express them in terms of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath30 we can see from fig .  1 that while @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the lightest neutrino mass can be arbitrarily small implying that the lightest neutrino could be even massless .",
    "the lower limits for @xmath33 and @xmath34 are saturated when @xmath35 . in this case one",

    "one obtains the limit of quasi - degenerate neutrinos when all three masses can be arbitrarily close to each other .",
    "however , the lightest neutrino mass is upper bounded by absolute neutrino mass scale experiments .",

    "that translates into the same upper bound on @xmath30 .",
    "this is derived from model - independent kinematic considerations that apply independently of whether neutrinos have a dirac or majorana nature .",

    "notice , however , that all current data from low - energy neutrino experiments are also consistent with a more minimal model with only two rh neutrinos that will be discussed in section 9 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , a dirac mass term @xmath51 is generated by the higgs vev @xmath52 . in the seesaw limit , @xmath53 , the spectrum of neutrino masses splits into a light set given by the eigenvalues @xmath54 of the neutrino mass matrix [ seesaw ] m _ = - m_d1mm_d^t , and into a heavy set @xmath55 coinciding to a good approximation with the eigenvalues of the majorana mass matrix corresponding to eigenstates @xmath56 .",

    "the lightness of ordinary neutrinos is explained just as an algebraic by - product .",
    "if the largest eigenvalue in the dirac neutrino mass matrix is assumed to be of the order of the electroweak scale , as for the other massive fermions , then the atmospheric neutrino mass scale @xmath28 can be naturally reproduced for @xmath59 , very close to the grand - unified scale .",
    "this is the minimal version of the seesaw mechanism , often indicated as type i seesaw mechanism .",
    "the seesaw formula  ( [ seesaw ] ) can be recast as an orthogonality condition for a matrix @xmath60 that in a basis where simultaneously the charged lepton mass matrix and the majorana mass matrix are diagonal , provides a useful parametrisation of the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xcite , [ casas ] m_d = ud_m^1/2 d_m^1/2 , where @xmath61 .",
    "the orthogonal matrix contains 6 independent parameters and together with the neutrino masses , determines the properties of the heavy rh neutrinos , the three lifetimes and the three total @xmath62 asymmetries . in this way",
    ", one can easily see that the total number of additional parameters introduced by the see - saw lagrangian is 18 in the case of 3 rh neutrinos .",
    "the orthogonal parametrisation is quite useful since , given a model that specifies @xmath63 and the three rh neutrino masses @xmath64 , one can easily impose both the experimental information on the @xmath65 low - energy neutrino parameters ( 6 contained in @xmath8 and the 3 @xmath66 ) and , as we will see , also the requirement of successful leptogenesis .",
    "leptogenesis belongs to a class of models of baryogenesis where the asymmetry is generated from the the out - of - equilibrium decays of very heavy particles .",
    "interestingly , this is the same class to which the first model proposed by sakharov belongs .",
    "this class of models became very popular with the advent of grand unified theories ( gut ) that provided a well - defined and motivated framework . in gut",
    "baryogenesis models the very heavy decaying particles generating the asymmetry are the same new gauge bosons predicted by the gut s",
    ". however , the final asymmetry depends on too many untestable parameters , so that imposing successful baryogenesis does not lead to compelling experimental predictions .",
    "this lack of predictability is made even stronger considering that the decaying particles are too heavy to be produced thermally and one has , therefore , to invoke a non - thermal production mechanism of the gauge bosons .",
    "this is because while the mass of the gauge bosons is about the gut scale , @xmath67 , the reheating temperature at the end of inflation @xmath68 can not be higher than @xmath69 from cmb observations , where the reheating temperature is the value of the temperature at the beginning of the radiation - dominated regime after inflation @xcite .    the minimal ( and original ) version of leptogenesis , that we discuss in this review ,",
    "is based on the type i seesaw mechanism  @xcite , where the asymmetry is produced by the three heavy rh neutrinos predicted by the see - saw mechanism and whose masses can have values orders - of - magnitude below the upper bound on the @xmath70 from inflation and cmb observations",
    ". we will call ` minimal leptogenesis scenarios ' those scenarios based on a type i seesaw mechanism and on a thermal production of the rh neutrinos , implying that @xmath68 can not be too much below ( at least ) the lightest rh neutrino mass @xmath71 . at these high temperatures",
    "the rh neutrinos can be produced by the yukawa interactions of leptons and higgs bosons in the thermal bath .",
    "a solution of the boltzmann equations shows that , more exactly , @xmath68 can be even up to @xmath72 times lower than @xmath71 , the exact value depending on the strength of the coupling @xcite .    after their production , the rh neutrinos decay either into lepton and higgs doublets @xmath73 ( when leptogenesis takes place , the electroweak symmetry is not broken ) with a decay rate @xmath74 , or into anti - lepton and conjugate higgs doublets @xmath75 with a decay rate @xmath76 . both inverse processes and decays violate lepton number ( @xmath77 ) and in general @xmath62 as well .",
    "it is also important to notice that they also violate the @xmath78 asymmetry , ( @xmath79 ) . at temperatures @xmath80 ,",
    "non - perturbative standard model processes called sphalerons are in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "they violate both lepton and baryon number while they still conserve @xmath78 .",
    "hence the lepton asymmetry produced in the elementary processes is reprocessed in a way that @xmath81 of the @xmath78 asymmetry is in the form of baryon number while @xmath82 of the @xmath78 asymmetry is in the form of a lepton number @xcite .",
    "therefore , two of the sakharov conditions are satisfied . the third sakharov condition , departure from thermal equilibrium ,",
    "is also satisfied since a fraction of the decays occur out of equilibrium , implying that part of the asymmetry survives the washout from inverse processes .    in the most general approach , even within minimal leptogenesis ,",
    "the asymmetry depends on all the 18 seesaw parameters and the calculation itself presents different technical difficulties .",
    "however , there is a simplified scenario @xcite that grasps most of the main features of leptogenesis and is able to highlight important connections with the low - energy neutrino parameters in an approximated way .",
    "we will refer to this scenario as ` vanilla leptogenesis ' .",
    "let us discuss the main assumptions and approximations .",
    "the first assumption is the one - flavour approximation , where the flavour composition of the leptons produced by ( or producing ) the rh neutrinos has no influence on the final value of the asymmetry and can be therefore neglected .",
    "it also assumes that leptons produced by different rh neutrinos can be treated , for all practical purposes , as having the same flavour ( i.e. @xmath83 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that what counts is just the asymmetry between the total number of leptons and the total number of anti - leptons irrespectively of whether these leptons are electron , muon or tauon doublets , and irrespectively of the rh neutrino that generated it . under this assumption",
    "the final @xmath78 asymmetry is the sum of two contributions [ nbmlf ] n^f_b - l = n^pre - ex , f_b - l+ n^lep , f_b - l .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side , @xmath84 , is the residual value of a possible pre - existing asymmetry generated by some external mechanism prior to the onset of leptogenesis .",
    "it has to be regarded as a possible external contribution whose initial value would be set up by some independent source of leptogenesis .",
    "therefore , if leptogenesis is responsible for the observed asymmetry , this term has to be negligible .",
    "the second term is the genuine leptogenesis contribution to the final asymmetry and is given by the sum of the three contributions from each rh neutrino species , n^lep , f_b - l= _ i _ i _ i^f(k_1 , k_2 , k_3 ) .",
    "each contribution is the product of the total @xmath62 asymmetry @xmath85 times the final value of the efficiency factor , @xmath86 , which depends on the decay parameters @xmath87 , defined as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the hubble expansion rate , and the total decay rates are @xmath90 .",
    "the total @xmath62 asymmetries are defined as _ i - _ i-_i _ i+_i , and a perturbative calculation from the interference of tree level with one loop self - energy and vertex diagrams gives @xcite [ cpas ] _",
    "i = 316 _ jiim(h^h)_ii ( x_j / x_i ) , having introduced [ xi ] ( x)= 23x , and defined @xmath91 .",

    "after proper subtraction of the resonant contribution from @xmath103 processes in order to avoid double counting  @xcite , the inverse decay washout terms are simply given by [ wid ] w_i^id(z ) = 14k_ik_1(z_i)z_i^3 .",
    "the washout term @xmath104 is the non - resonant @xmath105 processes contribution .",
    "it gives a non - negligible effect only at @xmath106 and in this case it can be approximated as @xcite w(z ) ( m_110 ^ 10gev ) ( ^ 2 ) , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 . the efficiency factors can be simply calculated analytically as [ efial ] _",
    "i^f(k_i)=-_z_in^dzdn_n_idz e^-_z^dz[w(z)+_iw_i^id(z;k_i ) ] .",
    "the second assumption is that the rh neutrino mass spectrum is hierarchical with @xmath109 .    under these two assumptions",
    "( i.e. unflavoured description plus hierarchical rh neutrino mass spectrum ) and barring a particular case , that we will discuss later on , the final asymmetry is typically dominantly produced by the lightest rh neutrino out - of - equilibrium decays , in a way that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ nbmlf ] ) can be approximated by the first term ( @xmath110 ) , explicitly [ unflavoured ] n_b - l^f_1_1^ f(k_1 ) , so that an ` @xmath111-dominated scenario ' is realised .",
    "this happens either because @xmath112 or because the asymmetry initially produced by the @xmath113 decays is afterwards washed out by the lightest rh neutrino inverse processes such that @xmath114 .",
    "indeed , if we indicate with @xmath115 the contribution to the @xmath116 asymmetry from the two heavier rh neutrinos prior to the lightest rh neutrino washout , the final values are given simply by n_b - l^(2,3 ) , f = n_b - l^(2,3)(tm_1 ) e^-38k_1 .",
    "the same exponential washout factor also suppresses the residual value of a possible pre - existing asymmetry .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to impose the strong washout condition @xmath117 for the pre - existing asymmetry and for the contribution from heavier rh neutrinos to be negligible .",
    "the decay parameters can be expressed in terms of the see - saw parameters as k_i=(h^h)_ii v^2m_i m _ , where @xmath118  ev is the equilibrium neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite straightforward that , barring cancellations in the seesaw formula , one typically has @xmath119@xmath120@xmath121 , where @xmath122 .",
    "the same condition also guarantees that the final asymmetry is independent of the initial @xmath111-abundance .",
    "it is then quite suggestive that the measured values of @xmath29 and @xmath28 have just the right values to produce a washout that is strong enough to guarantee independence of the initial conditions but still not that strong to prevent successful leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "this _ leptogenesis conspiracy _ between experimental results and theoretical predictions is the main reason that has determined the success of leptogenesis during the last years .",
    "there is a particular case where @xmath117 does not hold and in this case the final asymmetry can be dominated by the contribution coming from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos @xcite . for this case one",
    "still has @xmath123 , so that the independence of the initial conditions holds nonetheless .",
    "for the time being , as an additional third assumption , we will not consider this particular case .    if one excludes cancellations among the different terms contributing to the neutrino masses in the seesaw formula , one obtains the davidson - ibarra upper bound on the lightest rh neutrino @xmath62 asymmetry @xcite [ cpbound ] _ 1 _ 1^max 10 ^ -6m_110 ^ 10gevm_atmm_1+m_3 .",
    "imposing @xmath124 , one obtains the allowed region in the plane @xmath125 shown in the left panel of fig .  2 .",
    "one can notice the existence of an upper bound on the light neutrino masses @xmath126 @xcite , incompatible with quasi - degenerate neutrino mass models , and a lower bound on @xmath127 @xcite implying a lower bound on the reheat temperature @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "an important feature of vanilla leptogenesis is that the final asymmetry does not directly depend on the parameters of leptonic mixing matrix @xmath8 .",
    "that implies that one can not establish a direct model - independent connection .",
    "in particular the discovery of @xmath62 violation in neutrino mixing would not be a smoking gun for leptogenesis and , vice versa , a non - discovery would not rule out leptogenesis .",
    "however , within more restricted scenarios , for example imposing some conditions on the neutrino dirac mass matrix , links can emerge . in section 9",
    "we will discuss in detail the interesting case of @xmath50-inspired models .",
    "in the past years different directions beyond the vanilla leptogenesis scenario were explored , usually aiming at evading the above - mentioned bounds .",
    "for example , it was noticed that the davidson - ibarra bound eq .",
    "( [ cpbound ] ) is strictly speaking evaded by an extra - term contribution @xmath129 to the total @xmath62 asymmetry @xcite . however , this extra - term vanishes if @xmath130 and is suppressed as @xmath131 .",
    "it can significantly relax the bounds on neutrino masses only when @xmath132 , implying cancellations with a certain degree of fine tuning in the see - saw formula for the neutrino masses . for example",
    ", in usual models with @xmath133 , this extra - contribution can be safely neglected for @xmath134 .",
    "the development that proved to have the most important impact on the final asymmetry , compared to a calculation within the vanilla scenario , is certainly the inclusion of flavour effects . for this reason",
    "we discuss them in detail in the next section .",
    "the inclusion of flavour effects provides the most significant modification in the calculation of the final asymmetry compared to the vanilla scenario .",
    "two kinds of flavour effects are neglected in the vanilla scenario : heavy neutrino flavour effects , how heavier rh neutrinos can contribute to the final asymmetry , and lepton flavour effects , how the flavour composition of the leptons quantum states produced in the rh neutrino decays affects the calculation of the final asymmetry .",
    "we first discuss the two effects separately , and then we show how their interplay can have very interesting consequences .      in the vanilla scenario",
    "the contribution to the final asymmetry from the heavier rh neutrinos is negligible because either the @xmath62 asymmetries are suppressed in the hierarchical limit compared to @xmath135 ( cf .",
    "( [ cpbound ] ) ) and/or because , even assuming that a sizeable asymmetry ( compared to the observed one ) is produced at @xmath136 , it is later on washed out by the lightest rh neutrino inverse processes .",
    "however , as we anticipated , there is a particular case when , even neglecting the lepton flavour composition and assuming a hierarchical heavy neutrino mass spectrum , the contribution to the final asymmetry from next - to - lightest rh neutrino decays can be dominant and explain the observed asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to a particular choice of the orthogonal matrix such that @xmath111 is so weakly coupled ( corresponding to @xmath137 ) that its washout can be neglected . for the same choice of the parameters , the @xmath138 total @xmath62 asymmetry @xmath139 is unsuppressed if @xmath140 . in this case",
    "a @xmath138-dominated scenario is realised .",
    "notice that in this case the existence of a third ( heavier ) rh neutrino species is crucial in order to have a sizeable @xmath139 .",
    "the contribution from the two heavier rh neutrino species is also important in the quasi - degenerate limit when @xmath141 . in this case",
    "the @xmath62 asymmetries @xmath142 are not suppressed , and the washout from the lighter rh neutrino species is moderate , with no exponential prefactor @xcite .",
    "the importance and generality of flavour effects in leptogenesis was fully highlighted in @xcite .",
    "their role was first discussed in @xcite and included in specific scenarios in @xcite .    for the time being , let us continue to assume that the final asymmetry is dominantly produced from the decays of the lightest rh neutrinos @xmath111 , neglecting the contribution from the decays of the heavier rh neutrinos @xmath138 and @xmath143 .",
    "if @xmath144 , the flavour composition of the quantum states of the leptons produced from @xmath111 decays has no influence on the final asymmetry and a one - flavour regime holds @xcite .",
    "this is because the lepton quantum states evolve coherently between the production from a @xmath111-decay and a subsequent inverse decay with a higgs boson . in this way",
    "the lepton flavour composition does not play any role .    however , if @xmath145 , during the relevant period of generation of the asymmetry , the produced lepton quantum states will , on average , have an interaction with rh tauons before undergoing the subsequent inverse decay . in this way",
    "the tauon component of the lepton quantum states is measured by the thermal bath and the coherent evolution breaks down @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the subsequent inverse decays , the lepton quantum states are an incoherent mixture of a tauon component and of a ( still coherent ) superposition of an electron and a muon component that we can indicate with @xmath146 .    the fraction of asymmetry stored in each flavour component is not proportional in general to the branching ratio of that component .",
    "this implies that the two flavour asymmetries , the tauon and the @xmath146 components , evolve differently and have to be calculated separately . in this way",
    "the resulting final asymmetry can considerably differ from the result in the one - flavour regime .",
    "this can be indeed approximated by the expression [ twofully ] n^f_b - l 2_1(k_1 ) + p_12 , where @xmath147 , the @xmath148 s ( @xmath149 ) are the tree level probabilities that the leptons @xmath150 and the anti - leptons @xmath151 produced in the decays of the @xmath111 s are in the flavour @xmath152 , while @xmath153 is the difference between the probability to find @xmath150 in the flavour @xmath154 and that one to find @xmath151 in the flavour @xmath155 . if we compare this expression with the one - flavour regime result eq .",

    "the most extreme case is when the total @xmath78 number is conserved ( i.e. @xmath160 ) and still the second term in eq .  ( [ twofully ] ) can be non - vanishing @xcite and even explain the observed asymmetry @xcite .",
    "if @xmath161 , even the coherence of the @xmath146 component is broken by the muon interactions between decays and inverse decays and a full three flavour regime applies . in the intermediate regimes",
    "a density matrix formalism is necessary to properly describe decoherence @xcite .",

    "as an interesting phenomenological consequence , the same source of @xmath62 violation that could take place in neutrino oscillations could be sufficient to explain the observed asymmetry @xcite , though under quite stringent conditions on the rh neutrino mass spectrum and with an exact determination requiring a density matrix calculation @xcite .",

    "in @xcite it was found that it holds up to @xmath170 , implying in any case an upper bound much above current experimental bounds and , therefore , uninteresting . in @xcite , including the information from low energy neutrino data and accounting for the higgs asymmetry , it was found again that it holds only up to @xmath169 and in this case a density matrix approach would be required for a conclusion .      as we have seen , when lepton flavour effects are neglected , the possibility that the next - to - lightest rh neutrino decays contribute to the final asymmetry relies on a special case realising the @xmath138-dominated scenario @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when lepton flavour effects are taken into account , the contribution from heavier rh neutrinos can not be neglected in a much more general situation .",
    "even the contribution from the heaviest rh neutrinos can be sizeable ( i.e. explain the observed asymmetry ) and has to be taken into account in general .    as a result",
    ", the calculation of the final asymmetry becomes much more involved .",
    "assuming hierarchical mass patterns and that the rh neutrino processes occur in one of the three different fully flavoured regimes , one has to consider ten different mass patterns , shown in fig .  2 , that require specific multi - stage sets of classical boltzmann equations for the calculation of the final asymmetry .      among these 10 rh neutrino mass patterns , for those three where the @xmath111 washout occurs in the three - fully - flavoured regime , for @xmath171 ,",

    "while in the unflavoured approximation the lightest rh neutrino washout yields a global exponential washout factor , when lepton flavour effects are taken into account , the asymmetry produced by the heavier rh neutrinos , at the @xmath111 washout , gets distributed into an incoherent mixture of charged lepton flavour eigenstates @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath111 washout in one of the three flavours is negligible , corresponding to have at least one @xmath173 , in quite a wide region of the parameter space @xcite . in this way , accounting for flavour effects , the region of applicability of the @xmath138-dominated scenario enlarges considerably , since it is not necessary that @xmath111 fully decouples but it is sufficient that it decouples just in a specific lepton flavour @xcite .",
    "the unflavoured @xmath138-dominated scenario is recovered in the limit where all three @xmath173 and either @xmath174 or for @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "recently , it has also been realised that , accounting for the higgs and for the quark asymmetries , the dynamics of the flavour asymmetries couple and the lightest rh neutrino washout in a particular flavour can be circumvented even when @xmath111 is strongly coupled in that flavour @xcite .",
    "another interesting effect arising in the @xmath138-dominated scenario is _",
    "phantom leptogenesis_. this is a pure quantum - mechanical effect that for example allows parts of the electron and of the muon asymmetries , the phantom terms , to undergo a weaker washout at the production than the total asymmetry .",
    "it has been recently shown that phantom terms associated to a rh neutrino species @xmath177 with @xmath178 are present not just in the @xmath138-dominated scenario @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that phantom terms produced by the lightest rh neutrinos cancel with each other and thus do not contribute to the final asymmetry , though they can induce flavoured asymmetries much larger than the total asymmetry , something potentially relevant in active - sterile neutrino oscillations  @xcite .      even assuming a strong rh neutrino mass hierarchy , a coupled @xmath111 in all lepton flavours ( @xmath179 for any @xmath152 ) and @xmath180 ( it corresponds to the first panel in fig .",
    "2 ) , the asymmetry produced by the heavier rh neutrino decays at @xmath181 , in particular by the @xmath138 s decays , can be large enough to explain the observed asymmetry by avoiding most of the washout from the lightest rh neutrino processes .",
    "this is because , in general , there is an ` orthogonal ' component that escapes the @xmath111 washout @xcite while the remaining ` parallel ' component undergoes the usual exponential washout . for a mild mass hierarchy , @xmath182 , even the asymmetry produced by the @xmath143 s decays can be large enough to explain the observed asymmetry and escape the @xmath111 and @xmath138 washout .",
    "heavy neutrino flavour projection is also occurring when @xmath183 , in this case in the @xmath184@xmath185 plane .",
    "when the effect of heavy neutrino flavour projection is taken into account jointly with an additional contribution to the flavoured @xmath62 asymmetries @xmath186 that is not suppressed when the heaviest rh neutrino mass @xmath187 , this can lead to the possibility of a dominant contribution from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos even in an effective two rh neutrino model that can be regarded as as a limit case in a ( more appealing ) three rh neutrino case with @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , in the vanilla scenario the unflavoured assumption reduces the problem of the dependence on the initial conditions to simply imposing the strong washout condition @xmath117 .",
    "in other words , there is a full equivalence between strong washout and independence of the initial conditions .",
    "when ( lepton and heavy neutrino ) flavour effects are considered , the situation is much more involved and for example imposing strong washout conditions on all flavoured asymmetries ( @xmath188 ) is not enough to guarantee independence of the initial conditions .",
    "perhaps the most striking consequence is that in a traditional @xmath111-dominated scenario there is no condition that can guarantee independence of the initial conditions .",
    "the only possibility to have independence of the initial conditions is represented by a tauon @xmath138-dominated scenario  @xcite , i.e. a scenario where the asymmetry is dominantly produced from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos , and therefore @xmath189 , in the tauon flavour .",
    "the condition @xmath171 is also important to have projection on the orthonormal three lepton flavour basis before the lightest rh neutrino washout @xcite .",
    "as explained in the last section , leptogenesis is sensitive to the temperature range at which the asymmetry is produced .",
    "this determines whether the lepton quantum states produced in rh neutrino decays either remain coherent or undergo decoherence and get projected in flavour space before scattering in inverse processes .",
    "moreover , since the lepton states produced in heavy neutrino decays differ in general from the lepton flavour eigenstates , lepton flavour oscillations can also in principle arise in a similar way as neutrino oscillations happen in vacuum or in a medium . in order to treat the problem of flavour oscillations and partial loss of decoherence in a consistent way",

    "first , the quasi - particle ansatz , also known as the on - shell approximation , which states : d_(x , p)=2 sgn(p^0)(p^2-m^2 ) , where @xmath257 is the central coordinate .",
    "then , one can express the statistical propagator for the occupation number using the so - called kadanoff - baym ansatz , d_f(x , p)=d_(x , p ) , which is chosen such that , in equilibrium , the correct _ fluctuation dissipation relation _ between @xmath258 and @xmath259 is automatically obtained ( see @xcite for more details ) . with these approximations ,",
    "one arrives at a boltzmann equation which includes finite density effects .",
    "this equation would be similar to the kinetic equation  ( [ momentumke ] ) , with however the important new property : [ property ] | ( n)|^2 = | ( n)|^2 = |_0 ( n)|^2 ( 1+(p , t ) ) , where subscript ` 0 ' denotes tree level , and  @xcite ( p , t)=(1+[f_^eq(e_1 ) -f_^eq(e_2 ) ] ) where @xmath260 is the @xmath62 asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "( [ cpas ] ) , and @xmath261 $ ] .",
    "note that the above property in eq .",
    "( [ property ] ) explicitly avoids the double counting problem , which plagues the momentum - dependent description of the last subsection ( as well as the usual integrated one ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the @xmath62 asymmetry parameter now includes finite density effects via a dependence on the higgs and lepton distribution functions .",
    "this result agrees with that one found using thermal field theory in the real time formalism , when the right convention is used @xcite , as well as in the imaginary time formalism as recently obtained  @xcite .",
    "it , however , disagrees with an earlier work based on thermal field theory in the real time formalism , where a term quadratic in the distribution functions was found  @xcite .",
    "one should then wonder whether the non - equilibrium formalism described above leads to substantial differences in the leptogenesis predictions for the baryon asymmetry .",
    "it turns out that the modifications are very important ( up to an order of magnitude ) in the regime where @xmath262 , but they tend to vanish in the non - relativistic regime @xmath263 . in other words ,",
    "major changes are expected mainly in the weak washout regime for a vanishing initial rh neutrino abundance , because in this case the asymmetry is produced in both regimes : the initial asymmetry is produced with the wrong sign at early times and is compensated by the right - sign asymmetry at later times .",
    "this was confirmed in  @xcite , where it was found that the sign of the final asymmetry could even get changed by finite density effects . in all other cases ,",
    "corrections are quantitatively small , in particular in the strong washout regime , @xmath264 , where the asymmetry is produced exclusively in the non - relativistic regime  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study whether the above quantum kinetic formalism can provide some insight onto the @xmath62 asymmetry produced in the extreme quasi - degenerate limit , @xmath265 .",
    "this formalism includes off - shell effects , as well as the proper inclusion of coherent transitions @xmath266 , both of which should be important when @xmath267 .",
    "this problem attracted some attention recently  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was found that the enhancement of the @xmath62 asymmetry derived within the kadanoff - baym ( kb ) formalism , r^kb = m_1 m_2 ( m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2)(m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2)^2+(m_1_1+m_2_2)^2 , differs from the boltzmann result , r^be = m_1 m_2 ( m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2)(m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2)^2+(m_1_1-m_2_2)^2 , specifically because of a contribution from coherent rh neutrino oscillations .",
    "this would prevent any additional enhancement when @xmath268 , as predicted by the inverse seesaw model .",
    "in such a case , the new region in the parameter space of successful leptogenesis explored in  @xcite is not available .",
    "we saw in section 5 how the first kind of ` quantum ' effects were included , namely flavour oscillations and decoherence , by switching from classical boltzmann equations for lepton number densities to evolution equations for the density matrix .",
    "for the lightest rh neutrino and two relevant lepton flavours , we presented eq .",
    "( [ densmateq ] ) .",
    "the ctp formalism can also account for a flavour matrix structure , through the lepton propagators and self - energies .",
    "reassuringly , the structure of eq .",
    "( [ densmateq ] ) was also found within this formalism  @xcite .",
    "leptogenesis occurs in the very hot thermal bath of the early universe .",
    "leptons and higgs fields have very fast interactions with the thermal bath due to their gauge couplings .",
    "this gives them an effective mass which is proportional to temperature  @xcite .",
    "this effective mass allows processes which were otherwise kinematically forbidden to occur , such as @xmath62-violating higgs decays to rh neutrinos , when @xmath269 .",
    "thermal effects have therefore a direct impact on leptogenesis , and the first study to try and quantify them @xcite employed a real time formalism and hard thermal loop resummation .",
    "it was found that the @xmath62 violating parameter has a strong temperature dependence , and that in the weak washout regime , there could be important differences with the zero - temperature treatment . on the other hand , in the strong washout regime , @xmath270 ,",
    "the usual results from a vacuum calculation are recovered with a good accuracy .",
    "recently , a new study came out using the imaginary time formalism  @xcite , and the @xmath62 asymmetry parameter was found to differ from  @xcite , and to agree with more recent attempts with non - equilibrium quantum field theory ( see previous section ) .",
    "chemical equilibrium holds among standard model particles in the early universe above the electroweak phase transition thanks to gauge interactions . on the other hand",
    ", yukawa interactions only force some new conditions ( between left- and right - handed fermions ) when the temperature is high enough , depending on the size of the yukawa coupling .",
    "if one imposes additionally hypercharge neutrality and the effect of electroweak and strong sphaleron equilibrium , one arrives at a set of relations among the chemical potentials ( or among the asymmetries ) of leptons , higgs and baryons  @xcite . these processes ,",
    "although not directly involved in the leptogenesis process , hence the name ` spectator processes '  @xcite , have an indirect effect on the final asymmetry through a modified washout .",
    "the first effect is the inclusion of the higgs asymmetry as a new contribution to the washout .",
    "the second effect is that the asymmetry originally produced in leptons of a particular flavour gets redistributed into the other flavours following precise relations  @xcite .",
    "this means that the set of boltzmann equations to solve for the different lepton flavours are now coupled to each other via a flavour coupling matrix .    within the @xmath111-dominated scenario ,",
    "the overall effect of spectator processes is usually subdominant compared to flavour effects , but it can change the final result by as much as 40% depending on the temperature at which the asymmetry is produced  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry has new degrees of freedom and new constraints can be derived .",
    "a full study was performed recently in  @xcite and the overall effect was found to be again of order one . within the @xmath138-dominated scenario , however ,",
    "potentially much bigger effects are possible @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that leptogenesis is well - described in the strong washout regime , @xmath270 , by just decays and inverse decays .",
    "the reason is that in this regime the asymmetry is produced at relatively late times , at @xmath271 , with no dependence on the dynamics happening at @xmath272 when scattering processes are important .",
    "however , they should be included in the weak washout regime for initial vanishing rh neutrino abundance .",
    "for instance , @xmath77 higgs - mediated scatterings involving top quarks , such as @xmath273 , contribute to the washout and the @xmath62 asymmetry  @xcite , and their inclusion is crucial to have a correct estimation of the final asymmetry in the weak washout regime  @xcite .",
    "scatterings involving gauge bosons , such as @xmath274 , have also been included , especially their contribution to the @xmath62 asymmetric source term  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the factorization of the @xmath62 asymmetry from decays and scatterings involving top quarks does not happen with scatterings involving gauge bosons . in particular",
    ", there is a new source of lepton - number - conserving @xmath62 asymmetry .",
    "the seesaw mechanism with three rh neutrinos extends the standard model by introducing eighteen new parameters . on the other hand",
    ", low - energy neutrino experiments can only potentially test the nine parameters in the low - energy neutrino mass matrix @xmath57 .",
    "nine high - energy parameters , those characterising the properties of the three rh neutrinos , the three masses and the six parameters encoded in the seesaw orthogonal matrix of eq .",
    "( [ casas ] ) , basically fixing , together with the light neutrino masses , the three lifetimes and the three total @xmath62 asymmetries , are not tested by low - energy neutrino experiments . quite interestingly , the requirement of successful leptogenesis , _",
    "b(m_,,m_i)=_b^cmb , provides an additional constraint on a combination of both low - energy neutrino parameters and high - energy neutrino parameters .",
    "however , just one additional constraint would not seem sufficient to over - constrain the parameter space leading to testable predictions . in spite of this observation , as we have seen , in the vanilla leptogenesis scenario one can derive an upper bound on the neutrino masses .",
    "the reason is that , within this scenario , the dependence of @xmath97 on the six parameters related to the properties of the two heavier rh neutrinos cancels out . in this way",
    "the asymmetry depends on a reduced subset of high - energy parameters ( just three instead of nine ) . at the same time , the final asymmetry gets strongly suppressed when the absolute neutrino mass scale it is larger than the atmospheric neutrino mass scale . for all these reasons , by maximising the final asymmetry over the high energy parameters and by imposing successful leptogenesis , an upper bound on the neutrino masses is found .",
    "when flavour effects are considered , the vanilla leptogenesis scenario holds only under very special conditions , as we have seen . in general , the final asymmetry depends also on the parameters in the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "therefore , accounting for flavour effects , one could naively hope to derive definite predictions on the leptonic mixing matrix as well , in addition to the upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "however , the situation is quite different when flavour effects are taken into account .",
    "this is because the final asymmetry depends , in general , also on the six parameters related describing the two heavier rh neutrino properties and that were cancelling out in the calculation of the final asymmetry in the vanilla scenario , and this goes at the expense of predictability .",
    "for this reason , in a general scenario with three rh neutrinos and flavour effects included , it is not possible to derive any prediction on low - energy neutrino parameters . as we discussed , even whether the upper bound @xmath167  ev on neutrino masses still holds or not is an open issue and a precise value seems to depend on a precise account of many different subtle effects and in particular it necessarily requires a density matrix formalism .    in order to gain predictive power ,",
    "two possibilities have been explored in the past years .",
    "a first possibility is to consider non - minimal scenarios giving rise to additional phenomenological constraints .",
    "for example , as discussed in section 6 , the inverse seesaw model , which technically can be still regarded as part of the minimal type i seesaw model , allows for non - trivial phenomenologies at low energy beyond standard neutrino oscillations , such as non - unitarity effects and observable lepton flavour violation .",
    "an experimental observation of any of these signatures would be of great value to reduce the freedom in the choice of seesaw parameters . in recent years , during the large hadron collider era , it has been also intensively explored the possibility that , within a non - minimal version of the seesaw mechanism , one can have successful low scale leptogenesis together with collider signatures .",
    "it has also been noticed that in the supersymmetric version of the seesaw , the branching ratios of lepton - flavour - violating processes or electric dipole moments are typically enhanced , and hence the existing experimental bounds further constrain the seesaw parameter space @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is to search for a reasonable scenario where the final asymmetry depends only on a reduced set of independent parameters over - constrained by the successful leptogenesis condition , as with the vanilla scenario . from this point of view",
    ", the account of flavour effects has opened very interesting new opportunities or even re - opened old attempts that fail within a strict unflavoured scenario .",
    "let us briefly discuss some of the main ideas that have been proposed within this second possibility , the first one being covered elsewhere in this issue  @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological possibility that attracted great attention is the two - rh neutrino model @xcite , where the third rh neutrino is either absent or effectively decoupled in the seesaw formula .",
    "this necessarily happens when @xmath275 , implying that the lightest left - handed neutrino mass @xmath30 has to vanish .",
    "it can be shown that the number of parameters decreases from 18 to 11 in this case .",
    "in particular the orthogonal matrix is parameterised in terms of just one complex angle .    in leptogenesis",
    "the two - rh neutrino model has been traditionally considered as a sort of benchmark case for the @xmath111-dominated scenario , where the final asymmetry is dominated by the contribution from the lightest rh neutrinos @xcite . however , recently , as we anticipated already , it has been shown that there are some regions in the one complex angle parameter space that are @xmath138-dominated  @xcite and that correspond to so - called light sequential dominated models @xcite .",
    "it should be said that even though the number of parameters is highly reduced , in a general two - rh neutrino model it is still not possible to make predictions on the low - energy neutrino parameters . to this extent , one should further reduce the parameter space , for example assuming texture zeros in the neutrino dirac mass matrix .      in order to gain predictive power",
    ", one can impose conditions within some model of new physics embedding the seesaw mechanism .",
    "an interesting example is represented by the ` @xmath50-inspired leptogenesis scenario ' @xcite , where @xmath50-inspired conditions are imposed on the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath63 . in the basis where the charged leptons mass matrix and the majorana mass matrix are diagonal , in the bi - unitary parametrisation , one has @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the diagonalised neutrino dirac mass matrix and the mixing angles in @xmath278 are of the order of the mixing angles in the ckm matrix @xmath279 .",
    "the @xmath280 and three @xmath64 can then be calculated from @xmath278 , @xmath8 and @xmath66 , since the seesaw formula eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) directly leads to the takagi factorisation of @xmath281 , or explicitly @xmath282 .    in this way",
    "the rh neutrino masses and the matrix @xmath280 are expressed in terms of the low - energy neutrino parameters , of the eigenvalues @xmath283 and of the parameters in @xmath278 .",
    "typically one obtains a very hierarchical spectrum @xmath284 and @xmath285 , the asymmetry produced from the lightest rh neutrino decays is by far unable to explain the observed asymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , when the @xmath138 produced asymmetry is taken into account , successful ( @xmath138-dominated ) leptogenesis can be attained @xcite . in this case , imposing the leptogenesis bound and considering that the final asymmetry does not depend on @xmath286 and on @xmath287 , one obtains constraints on all low - energy neutrino parameters , which have some dependence on the parameter @xmath288 typically parameterised in terms of @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is the charm quark mass . some examples of the constraints on the low - energy neutrino parameters",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "they have been obtained scanning over the @xmath291 ranges of the allowed values of the low - energy parameters and over the parameters in @xmath278 assumed to be @xmath292 and for three values of @xmath293 .",
    "it is particularly interesting that when the independence of the initial conditions is imposed , negative values of @xmath294 seem to be favoured @xcite establishing a connection between the sign of @xmath294 and of the matter - antimatter asymmetry .    a supersymmetric version of this scenario including the renormalization group evolution of all the relevant couplings was also studied in  @xcite , and including a type ii contribution to the seesaw mechanism from a triplet higgs in left - right symmetric models in  @xcite .",
    "+    together with strongly hierarchical rh neutrino mass patterns , there exist also ` level crossing ' regions where at least two rh neutrino masses are arbitrarily close to each other , in a way that the lightest rh neutrino mass is uplifted and @xmath62 asymmetries are resonantly enhanced to some lever .",
    "also in this case , imposing the successful leptogenesis condition , one then obtains conditions , though quite fine tuned ones , on the low energy neutrino parameters @xcite .",
    "an account of heavy neutrino flavour effects is also important when leptogenesis is embedded within theories that try to explain tribimaximal mixing for the leptonic mixing matrix via flavour symmetries .",
    "it has been shown in particular that , if the symmetry is unbroken , then the @xmath62 asymmetries of the rh neutrinos would exactly vanish .",
    "on the other hand , when the symmetry is broken , for the naturally expected values of the symmetry breaking parameters , then the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry can be successfully reproduced @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that in a minimal picture based on an @xmath295 symmetry , one has a rh neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath296 .",
    "one has therefore that all the asymmetry is produced in the unflavoured regime and that the mass spectrum is only mildly hierarchical ( it has actually the same kind of hierarchy as light neutrinos ) . at the same time",
    ", the small symmetry breaking imposes a quasi - orthogonality of the three lepton quantum states produced in the rh neutrino decays . under these conditions",
    "the washout of the asymmetry produced by one rh neutrino species from the inverse decays of a lighter rh neutrino species is essentially negligible .",
    "the final asymmetry then receives a non - negligible contribution from the decays of all three rh neutrinos species .      within a supersymmetric vanilla framework",
    "the final asymmetry is only slightly modified compared to the non - supersymmetric calculation @xcite .",
    "however , supersymmetry introduces a conceptually important issue : the stringent lower bound on the reheat temperature , @xmath297 , is typically marginally compatible with an upper bound from the avoidance of the gravitino problem @xmath298 , with the exact value depending on the parameters of the model @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the solution of such an issue inspired an intense research activity on supersymmetric models able to reconcile minimal leptogenesis and the gravitino problem .",
    "of course , on the leptogenesis side , some of the discussed extensions beyond the vanilla scenario that relax the rh neutrino mass bounds also relax the @xmath68 lower bound .",
    "however , notice that in the @xmath138 dominated scenario , while the lower bound on @xmath71 simply disappears , there is still a lower bound on @xmath68 that is even more stringent , @xmath299 @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned already , with flavour effects one has the possibility to relax the lower bound on @xmath68 if a mild hierarchy in the rh neutrino masses is allowed together with a mild cancellation in the seesaw formula @xcite .",
    "however for most models , such as sequential dominated models @xcite , this solution does not work .",
    "a major modification introduced by supersymmetry is that the critical value of the mass of the decaying rh neutrinos setting the transition from an unflavoured regime to a two - flavour regime and from a two - flavour regime to a three flavour regime is enhanced by a factor @xmath300  @xcite .",
    "this has a practical relevance in the calculation of the asymmetry within supersymmetric models and it is quite interesting that leptogenesis becomes sensitive to such a relevant supersymmetric parameter .",
    "recently , a refined analysis , mainly discussing how the asymmetry is distributed among all particle species , has shown different subtle effects in the calculation of the final asymmetry within supersymmetric models finding corrections below @xmath301 @xcite .",
    "in 2011 two important experimental results have been announced that , if confirmed , can be interpreted as positive for future tests of leptogenesis .    the first result is the discovery of a non - vanishing @xmath302 ( cf . section 2 ) confirmed now by various experiments ( both long - baseline and reactor ) . an important consequence of the measurement of such a ` large ' @xmath10 is the encouraging prospects for the discovery of the neutrino mass ordering ( either normal or inverted ) in current or near - future neutrino oscillation experiments such as t2k and no@xmath303a . for instance , if the ordering is found to be inverted in these experiments , we should expect a signal in @xmath304 experiments in the next decade .",
    "if it is not found , the majorana nature of neutrinos , and therefore the seesaw mechanism , would be ruled out .",
    "moreover , such a large value of @xmath10 opens the possibility of a measurement of the neutrino oscillation @xmath62-violating invariant @xmath305 during next years .",
    "this would have some direct model - independent consequences .",
    "if a non - vanishing and close - to - maximal value is found ( @xmath306 ) , even the small contribution to the final asymmetry uniquely stemming from a dirac phase could be sufficient to reproduce the observed final asymmetry . more generally , the presence of @xmath62 violation at low energies would certainly support the presence of @xmath62 violation at high energies as well , since given a generic theoretical model predicting the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath63 , these are in general both present .",
    "a more practical relevance of such a measurement of @xmath294 , even if in the end it indicates a vanishing value within the experimental error , is that it will provide an additional constraint on specific models embedding the seesaw , satisfying successful leptogenesis and able to make predictions on the low energy neutrino parameters . in this way",
    ", the expected improvements in low - energy neutrino experiments , made easier by a non - vanishing @xmath10 , will test the models more and more stringently .",
    "the second important experimental result of 2011 is the hint for the existence of the higgs boson reported by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "there are at least two reasons why this hint can be also interpreted as positive for leptogenesis .",
    "first , because the whole leptogenesis mechanism relies on the yukawa coupling between higgs , lepton and rh neutrino .",
    "second , because the measurement of the higgs boson mass could in future open opportunities for additional phenomenological information to be imposed on leptogenesis scenarios , for example relying on the requirement of standard model electroweak vacuum stability @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to note that the current value of 125 gev is compatible with reheating temperatures as high as @xmath307 as needed by thermal leptogenesis , and it is also compatible with the requirement that the yukawa couplings of the rh neutrinos do not destabilise the higgs potential when rh neutrino masses @xmath64 , assumed to be quasi - degenerate , are smaller than @xmath308  gev .",
    "what are other possible future experimental developments that could further support the idea of leptogenesis ?",
    "an improved information from absolute neutrino mass scale experiments , both on the sum of the neutrino masses from cosmology and on @xmath309 from @xmath310 experiments could be crucial .",
    "for instance , if cosmology provides a measurement of the neutrino mass @xmath311 in the next few years , as it is reasonable to expect , then a positive signal in @xmath310 experiments must be found , otherwise majorana neutrinos and the seesaw mechanism will be disfavored . on the other hand , in case of a positive signal in @xmath310 experiments , we will be able to say that minimal leptogenesis with hierarchical heavy neutrino masses works in a optimal neutrino mass window @xmath312 @xcite , where independence of the initial conditions is more easily obtained and where we know that successful leptogenesis can be safely obtained from existing calculations using boltzmann equations . moreover , a determination of the allowed region in the plane @xmath309@xmath313 could provide an additional test of specific leptogenesis scenarios , such as , for example , @xmath50-inspired scenarios .    in conclusion , we are living in an exciting time where new experimental information is coming , which is providing and will continue to provide crucial tests for new physics models , in particular leptogenesis , in the near future .",
