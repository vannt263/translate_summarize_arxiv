    "2006 ) . after they were heated , cooled , and crystallized , chondrules were incorporated into the parent bodies from which chondrites originate .",
    "chondrules are capable of providing incredibly detailed information about conditions in the solar system protoplanetary disk , if the process that led to their heating , melting and recrystallization could be understood ( connolly & desch 2004 ; connolly et al .  2006 ; lauretta et al .",
    "chondrules make up to 80% of the volume of ordinary chondrites ( grossman 1988 ; ciesla 2005 ; lauretta et al .",

    "recent models are in good agreement with each other ( desch et al .",
    "for example , insn found chondrule cooling rates @xmath7 in many cases , and dc02 and ch02 found cooling rates @xmath8 .",
    "miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) found that for plausible parameters , the cooling rates of chondrules and gas cluster around @xmath9 .",
    "these values agree with each other and are distinct from the estimates of cooling rates predicted by other models , e.g. , lightning ( 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath10 @xmath11 ) , and the x - wind model ( @xmath12 ; shu et al .",
    "for example , chondrules melted by lightning are not embedded in a hot gas , so will radiate their stored heat energy to free space .",
    "the heat energy stored in a spherical chondrule of radius @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 is @xmath15 = 9.7 x 10@xmath10 erg , where @xmath16 = 3.3 g @xmath17 is the density of silicate in chondrules and @xmath18 = 1.3 x 10@xmath19 erg g@xmath1 k@xmath1 is the specific heat capacity .",
    "the rate at which the chondrule radiates away its energy is @xmath20 = 8.2 x 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath1 , where @xmath21 = 0.8 is the nir emissivity of silicate material ( li & greenberg 1997 ) , and @xmath22 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "once heated , an isolated chondrule will cool in seconds , whereas chondrule petrology argues for cooling over tens of minutes .",
    "while , overall , the nebular shock model successfully explains many aspects of chondrule formation , there remain differences between the models ( insn ; dc02 ; ch02 ) that lead them to infer different physical conditions in the site of chondrule formation , as reviewed by desch et al .  ( 2005 ) .",
    "these model differences all involve the calculation of radiation effects , especially the radiative losses from molecular line emission , the opacity of solids , and the input radiation field . dc02 and ch02 calculate the transfer of chondrule radiation , where insn neglect this effect . the effect of line cooling  the cooling of gas by emission of so - called  line photons \" ( photons of specific wavelengths ) by trace molecules in the gas such as co and @xmath23in solar nebula shocks was considered by insn and by miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) .",
    "line radiation from the water molecule @xmath23 , with its permanent electric dipole and its high cosmochemical abundance , is especially significant in a variety of astrophysical settings ( e.g. , cernicharo & crovisier 2005 ) .",
    "insn assumed a gas optically thin to the line radiation , whereas miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) allowed the gas to become marginally optically thick to this line radiation .",
    "dc02 and ch02 ignored the effect of line cooling , assuming an optically thick limit to the line radiation .",
    "it remains to be resolved , and it is the point of the work presented here to resolve , which treatment is most realistic .",
    "another difference between the models is dust opacity .",
    "only the opacity due to chondrules was considered by ch02 , insn and miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , dc02 considered opacity due to both chondrules and a gray ( no frequency or temperature dependence ) opacity of micron - sized dust , @xmath24 , up to a dust evaporation temperature @xmath25 , above which the dust opacity vanished .",
    "a final difference is the boundary condition assumed for the post - shock radiation field .",
    "both insn and ch02 set the radiation field to be that of a blackbody with temperature @xmath26 , with little justification , while dc02 used the incorrect jump conditions of hood & horanyi ( 1991 ) to derive a much higher post - shock temperature ( @xmath27 typically ) .",
    "the isothermal assumption @xmath26 , strictly speaking , violates the assumption of 1-d , but the jump conditions used by dc02 and hood & horanyi ( 1991 ) were incorrect .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to properly include these physical effects ( radiation boundary conditions , dust opacity and evaporation , and molecular line cooling ) , in order to better predict the thermal histories of chondrules .",
    "we describe our efforts to determine the appropriate input boundary conditions and the proper dust opacity and evaporation .",

    "experimental petrology has shown that the most important determinants of texture during chondrule formation are peak temperature , cooling rates , and the presence of external seed nuclei .",
    "cooling rates are constrained by texture , major and minor element abundances , and bulk chemistry ( connolly & desch 2004 ; connolly et al .",

    "2005 ; connolly et al .",
    "2006 ; lauretta et al .",
    "miyamoto et al .  ( 2009 ) recently developed a model to calculate cooling rates using the fe - mg chemical zoning profiles of olivine .",
    "they found that for the type ii porphyritic olivine chondrules in semarkona , the cooling rates through crystallization temperatures are broadly consistent with furnace experiments ( 10 - 1000 k hr@xmath1 ) .",
    "initial cooling above the liquidus was at least 5000 k hr@xmath1 ( yu et al .  1996 ; yu & hewins 1998 ; desch & connolly 2002 ) .",

    "additionally , chondrules retain volatile elements such as s , indicating that they did not remain above the liquidus for more than minutes , and cooled quite rapidly ( @xmath33 while above the liquidus ; yu & hewins 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of primary s tells us that chondrules did not experience prolonged heating between @xmath2 650 - 1200 k for more than several minutes ( hewins et al .",

    "2006 ) . finally , there is no indication of the isotopic fractionation that would arise from the free evaporation of alkalis such as na , which constrains the time spent at high temperature before melting ( tachibana et al .",
    "modeling of isotopic fractionation has shown that chondrules must heat up from 1300 to 1600 k in times on the order of minutes or less in order to prevent isotopic fractionation of s ( tachibana & huss 2005 ) .",
    "the only alternative to such rapid heating is if the ambient nebular gas was considerably enriched in volatile or moderately volatile elements ( connolly et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the time spent at the peak temperature also affects the amount of relict material that remains intact ( lofgren 1996 ; connolly & desch 2004 ; hewins et al .  2005 ; connolly et al .",
    "2006 ; lauretta et al .",
    "approximately 15% of chondrules in ordinary chondrites contain relict grains ( jones 1996 ) , the presence of which limits the duration of heating above the liquidus to tens of seconds to several minutes ( connolly et al .",
    "the texture and chemistry of these relict grains indicates that they are previous generations of chondrules , signifying that chondrules experienced multiple heating events ( jones et al .",
    "2005 ; connolly et al .",
    "2006 ; lauretta et al .",
    "evidence for multiple heating events is also found by the presence of fine - grained , igneous rims around some chondrules ; a layer of material that was heated and melted in an event that post - dated melting of the host chondrule ( hewins et al.1996 ; jones et al .",
    "2005 ) .      the combination of chondrules and the fine - grained matrix in chondritic meteorites results in a bulk composition very close to solar abundances , suggesting that the chondrules and matrix formed in the same vicinity within the solar nebula ( palme et al .",

    "2008 ; hezel & palme 2008 ) .",

    "the same complementarity of values for ti / al are found in al rais and the cv meteorites kaba , leoville , mokoia , and vigarano ( klerner & palme 2000 ) .",
    "additionally , the mg / si ratio in renazzo matrix was found to be sub - chondritic , while the ratio in the chondrules are supra - chondritic ( ebel et al .",
    "hezel & palme ( 2008 ) analyzed the ca / al ratios in the matrix and chondrules of allende and y-86751 .",
    "these two cv meteorites are almost identical in bulk composition and structure .",
    "hezel & palme found the ca / al ratio in the matrix of allende to be sub - chondritic and the ratio in the matrix to be super - chondritic , yet the opposite is found for y-86751 .",
    "hezel & palme interpret this as ruling out redistribution of ca during parent body alteration , and therefore is indicative of a redistribution of ca and al among chondrules and matrix grains before accretion onto the parent body . as these examples show , chondrules and the matrix grains that surround them in the chondrite thus formed from the same starting material , in the same vicinity of the solar nebula .",
    "this must be considered as an additional constraint on chondrule formation models .",
    "another constraint is the density of chondrules in the chondrule - forming region , which can be constrained in several different ways .",
    "the frequency of compound chondrules , two or more chondrules that are fused together while molten , allows an estimate of the density of chondrules during formation of 1 - 10 m@xmath34 ( gooding & keil 1981 ; wasson et al .  1995 ; hood & kring 1996 ; ciesla et al .",
    "2004a ; ciesla 2005 ; yasuda & nakamoto 2008 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that some compound chondrules  enveloping compound chondrules  provide evidence for multiple heating events ( wasson et al .",
    "1995 ; jones et al .  2005 ) .",
    "chondrule densities of @xmath2 10 m@xmath34 , over regions of @xmath2 10@xmath35 km , are also inferred from the lack of isotopic fractionation of volatiles during melting ( cuzzi & alexander 2006 ) .",
    "additionally , the retention of volatiles , such as na , places rather firm lower limits on chondrule density of this order as well ( cuzzi & alexander 2006 ; fedkin et al .  2006 ; alexander et al .  2008 ,",
    "kropf & pack 2008 ) .    finally , under the assumption that @xmath36al was homogeneous in the early solar system , there is an apparent age gap between cai and chondrule formation based on initial values of @xmath36al/@xmath4al ( russell et al .",

    "we summarize the model below and refer the reader to dc02 for further details .",
    "any shock generated in the solar nebula will heat solids in three ways : 1 ) by thermal exchange between the hot , dense , post - shock gas and the particles in the post - shock region ; 2 ) by frictional heating , as the particles are slowed to the reduced post - shock velocity in the post - shock region ; and 3 ) by absorption of infrared radiation emitted by heated particles everywhere , in both the pre - shock and post - shock regions .",
    "shocks are manifestly transient , non - equilibrium structures .",
    "shock models of chondrule formation must therefore account for the dynamics and energetics of chondrules and gas separately , including their interactions . for typical parameters ,",
    "such codes must also account for hydrogen dissociation and recombination .",
    "they must also account for the transfer and absorption and emission of radiation . to minimize the complexity of the problem ,",
    "dc02 considered a 1-d geometry , in which physical conditions were assumed to vary only with distance @xmath37 from the shock front .",
    "the calculations were also restricted to a range of @xmath37 , the computational domain .",
    "use of the 1-d approximation assumes implicitly that the lateral extent of the shock front greatly exceeds the computational domain .",
    "the dc02 code assumes separate gas and solid fluids .",
    "the gas is divided into four populations : atomic hydrogen ( h ) , molecular hydrogen ( @xmath38 ) , helium atoms ( he ) , and molecules resulting from the evaporation of solids , which is represented with sio .",
    "solids are divided into two types , dust grains and larger , spherical particles representative of chondrules .",
    "dust grains are assumed to be dynamically and thermally perfectly coupled to the gas , sharing its velocity and temperature .",
    "if at any point the dust grains exceed 2000 k they are assumed to be evaporated from that point forward .",
    "the chondrule - sized particles are divided into @xmath39 populations of identical particles , indexed by @xmath40 .",
    "unique to each population of ( spherical ) particles are the number density @xmath41 of particles , their velocity @xmath42 , their temperature @xmath43 , and their radii @xmath44 , as well as material properties .",
    "all fluids are initialized at the pre - shock computational boundary with speed @xmath45 , with temperature @xmath46 .",
    "their densities , velocities and temperatures are integrated forward using a fourth - order runge - kutta integration , assuming a steady - state flow and applying the equations of continuity , a force equation including the drag force between gas and solids , and appropriate energy equations .",
    "the gas can absorb radiation energy ( via the dust opacity ) , be heated by interaction with chondrules , and can lose or gain heat energy through dissociations or recombinations of hydrogen molecules .",
    "chondrules can emit or absorb radiation , or be heated by thermal exchange with the gas or by frictional heating .",
    "calculation of the radiation field followed the approach outlined in mihalas ( 1978 ) , assuming plane - parallel , temperature - stratified slab atmospheres .",
    "given the incident radiation fields and the source function , @xmath47 at all optical depths , the mean intensity of radiation , @xmath48 ( integrated over wavelength ) is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the optical depth , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the exponential integrals . during the integrations , the radiation field is considered fixed while the gas and particle dynamics and energetics are calculated as a function of @xmath37 .",

    "the solution is iterated until the radiation field and the particle temperatures are self - consistent . in this respect ,",
    "the calculation is a so - called lambda iteration , which is known to converge slowly ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "indeed , in our typical runs , convergence of particle temperatures everywhere to within 1 k and convergence in @xmath56 to within @xmath57 were only achieved in about several hundred iterations , a number comparable to the optical depths across the computational domain . a more sophisticated treatment of the radiative transfer is , however , difficult to implement , and is subject to many feedbacks .",
    "we chose to use the lambda iteration method for its ease of implementation , and for its demonstrated stability and convergence in reasonable computing times ( hours ) .",

    "we describe the updates to the radiation field jump conditions ; we derive the proper 1-d shock jump conditions for a gas - solids mixture , but show that it is usually justified to assume that the post - shock gas returns to the pre - shock temperature .",
    "we also discuss the appropriate dust opacity , and calculate the temperature at which dust effectively evaporates .",
    "we show that 1500 k is a much better approximation than the 2000 k assumed by dc02 .",

    "a major input to calculations of the radiation field ( more specifically , the frequency - integrated mean intensity , @xmath39 , at all locations ) is the input radiation field at the boundaries of the computational domain over which chondrule thermal histories are investigated , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . far from the shock front , in the pre - shock region , the radiation field @xmath59 is set to a blackbody radiation field at the ambient temperature , @xmath46 , of the gas ; but it is not immediately clear what the temperature , @xmath55 , in the post - shock region should approach .",
    "both insn and ch02 set @xmath26 , with little justification , while dc02 used the incorrect jump conditions of hood & horanyi ( 1991 ) to derive a much higher post - shock temperature ( typically , @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is important to physically justify the isothermal assumption , @xmath26 , because formally it violates the assumption of 1-d , since the total energy of the system is not conserved ; radiation in the direction lateral to the shock is required to carry away the energy in order for @xmath55 to fall to @xmath46 .",
    "although the jump conditions used by dc02 and hood & horanyi ( 1991 ) did not make this assumption ( they had @xmath61 ) , these jump conditions were incorrect because besides failing to consider the energy carried by solids , they used an incorrect expression for the radiative flux .",
    "below we describe the proper jump conditions , then discuss why the isothermal assumption is probably justified after all .",
    "jump conditions relate physical conditions ( e.g. , density @xmath16 , pressure @xmath62 , temperature @xmath63 , velocity @xmath64 ) at a point before the shock to those after the shock ( see mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) .",

    "second , we ignore the ability of gas molecules to absorb continuum photons : where dust exists , gas will absorb continuum photons via dust ; where it does not , gas will absorb only a small fraction ( we estimate @xmath173 , based on the mean free paths of _ line _ photons through the gas and through chondrules ) , of the total radiation field , and leave the remaining 98% untouched .",
    "the propagation of the continuum radiation field is not affected by neglecting absorption of continuum photons by the gas . in all cases where we have made approximations ,",
    "we have erred on the side of allowing the gas to cool and decreasing the radiative communication between the gas and chondrules .",
    "one of the most important , physically relevant effects captured by our approach , not captured in previous attempts to include line cooling , is that the emission of radiation from zone @xmath136 to other zones @xmath40 is always accompanied by the absorption in zone @xmath136 of radiation from other zones @xmath40 . even if @xmath174 , some radiation from zone @xmath40 will be absorbed in zone @xmath136 , limiting the net cooling in that zone , an effect we term  backwarming \" .",

    "this increased cooling rate falls considerably short of the cooling rates @xmath7 predicted by the toy model of morris et al .",

    "we investigate this issue in what follows .",
    "in this section , we seek a physical explanation for the lack of significant cooling due to emission of line photons . the toy model of morris et al .",
    "( 2009 ) included line cooling but did not consider hydrogen dissociation and recombinations , and did not consider changes in the gas velocity or density .",
    "this model had predicted that gas more than a few hundred kilometers past the shock front would be surrounded in all directions by sufficient column densities of warm gas to prevent the escape of line photons , and line cooling would effectively shut off . but travelling this distance would take roughly 0.1 hr , during which time gas would be cooling at rates @xmath213 , dropping several hundred k in temeprature .",
    "chondrules are imperfectly thermally coupled to the gas during this stage , but might be expected to drop several hundred k in temperature as well .",
    "the runs presented here did not exhibit this behavior , though , as chondrule temperatures differed by only a few k due to the inclusion of line cooling .",
    "some physical mechanism not included in the toy model must act on chondrules heated in shocks .",
    "dissociation and recombinations of hydrogen molecules are already known to have a major bearing on the gas temperature in chondrule - forming shocks , especially in the first seconds after passing through the shock front .",
    "each dissociation of an @xmath38 molecule consumes @xmath214 of energy .",
    "this is about 10 times the thermal energy of the molecule , so dissociation of just a few percent of the @xmath38 molecules can significantly change the temperature of the gas .",
    "indeed , in our canonical shock ( without line cooling ) , after the adiabatic jump across the shock front raises the gas temperature to 3800 k , dissociation of hydrogen molecules occurs , cooling the gas , so that quasi chemical equilibrium is reached , where @xmath2 15 % of the hydrogen molecules are dissociated and the gas is now at 2200 k. this cooling takes place in approximately 17 seconds , at a rate @xmath215 . since hydrogen dissociation also buffers the temperature rise at the shock front , it can be expected that as the gas cools , recombinations of hydrogen molecules , which will release energy , will buffer the cooling as well .",
    "we can estimate the buffering of cooling rates while hydrogen molecules are recombining .",
    "we suppose a purely hydrogen gas with a number density of hydrogen nuclei ( atomic plus molecular ) @xmath216 . we define the atomic fraction @xmath217 .",
    "following equation 6.1 of spitzer ( 1978 ) , we now compute the thermal evolution of the gas as @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the dissociation energy of @xmath38 , and @xmath220 is the net radiative heating rate of the gas . by assuming constant density in the post - shock region ( @xmath221 ) , it is straightforward to show that @xmath222^{-1 }    \\ , \\left [   \\frac{2 \\left ( \\gamma - \\lambda \\right)_{\\rm rad}}{n_{\\rm h , tot}\\;k } \\right].\\ ] ] compared to the case without dissociation / recombination , in which @xmath223 , the cooling rate is reduced by a  buffering factor \" @xmath224 , where @xmath225 .",

    "( it is worth noting that chemical equilibrium is established within a matter of seconds at these densities . )",
    "both @xmath229 and its derivative @xmath230 are displayed in figure 10 .",
    "these are used as inputs to the buffering factor of equation  [ eq : buffering ] , which is displayed as a function of temperature in figure 11 .",
    "it is readily seen that at constant density ( approximately true in the post - shock region ) , the heating due to hydrogen molecule recombinations reduces the cooling rates by factors @xmath2 2 - 10 below what they would otherwise be .",

    "cooling rates are reduced by a factor of 2 - 10.,width=529 ]    buffering by recombination of @xmath38 molecules , in concert with other factors , conspires to reduce the efficacy of line cooling .",
    "if one were to estimate the cooling rate of the gas due to optically thin line emission , one might take the cooling rate per volume to be @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the number density of water molecules , and @xmath234 = @xmath235 at 2250 k ( morris et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the thermal energy of the gas is @xmath236 .",
    "assuming ratios @xmath237 and @xmath238 , one would estimate a cooling rate @xmath239 at 2250 k. one effect that reduces the cooling rate below these values is the column density of water .",
    "the first few seconds past the shock are dominated by the temperature drop associated with @xmath38 dissociation and are characterized by a decoupling of chondrule and gas temperatures ; at any rate , the chondrule temperature does not record conditions in the first few seconds past the shock .",
    "a mere 10 seconds ( and about 10 km ) past the shock front , though , ( during which line cooling could cool the gas by at most @xmath240 ) , the column density of water between gas and the shock front is @xmath241 , already leaving the optically thin regime of line emission .",
    "this alone will reduce the cooling rate at 2250 k to @xmath242 .",
    "a second effect is backwarming . although the hot , post - shock gas ( @xmath2 2200 k ) is emitting @xmath58line emission , @xmath58molecules in this region also absorb line radiation from surrounding",
    " warm \" regions ( @xmath2 1750 k , both in the pre - shock and post - shock regions ) . so the net cooling is reduced .",
    "as we discuss below , this hot slab of gas will also heat gas further downstream . a third effect reducing",
    "the cooling rate is the buffering of the cooling rate by hydrogen recombinations . at 2250 k ( just 10 s past the shock front )",
    ", these reduce the cooling rate by a factor @xmath243 , to only @xmath244 .",
    "as the gas moves farther from the shock front and continues to cool , all the factors conspire to reduce the cooling rate from line emission : the temperatures drop , lowering the rate of emission ; the column density of water to the shock front increases ; the relative effects of backwarming increase ; and the buffering from hydrogen recombinations remains effective .",
    "for example , as the gas moves to a distance 3000 km past the shock front after 3000 s , the cooling rate of the gas drops considerably as the column density of water ( @xmath245 ) becomes optically thick , to only @xmath246 .",
    "this implies that the effect of line cooling should be to make the gas drop in temperature during the first hour , by an extra several hundred k above what it would otherwise drop .",
    "cooling rates @xmath247 are much slower than one would predict in the absence of a finite column density of water and the buffering due to hydrogen recombinations .",
    "on the other hand , our complete calculation suggests the effect of line cooling is even smaller than this , leading only to an additional @xmath248 .",
    "this indicates that the reasons for the slow cooling lie in additional factors still not considered .",
    "the gas cooling rate , we find , is extremely insensitive to the effects of line cooling .",
    "we attribute this to the complicated nature of  backwarming \" in the shocked flow . at every point , even immediately past the shock front , @xmath58molecules emit into a background only slightly cooler than the local temperature . since there is nowhere much cooler to radiate , the net cooling",
    "is much reduced .",
    "line photons tend to be absorbed within about 100 km of the place where they are emitted .",
    "based on the temperature gradient far downstream from the shock , the temperature change over 100 km is @xmath249 .",
    "because of backwarming , water molecules will on average absorb line photons from the slightly warmer upstream gas , and on average emit line photons to the slightly cooler downstream gas , but the net effect is very small . just past the shock front , the temperature gradients are larger , but the heating is more intense .",
    "the shocking of the gas produces a hot slab of gas with a thickness of hundreds of kilometers and a temperature well in excess of 2000 k , which emits line photons into the post - shock gas .",
    "we attribute the extremely reduced gas cooling rates we observe in our simulations ( only @xmath248 above what they would be otherwise , at 100 s past the shock front ) , to the fact that line emission only cools the gas if line photons can escape into a cooler medium , and in the shocks considered here , there are no significantly cooler regions for the line photons to be lost to .",
    "significantly , this result could not be discovered without the approach we have adopted here .",
    "the effect of line emission on chondrule temperatures is even more limited .",
    "after the drag heating stage of chondrules ends , at about 30 seconds , the temperatures of chondrules are primarily set by absorption and emission of radiation .",
    "the rate at which chondrules absorb or emit radiation is , per area , @xmath250 @xmath251 at @xmath252 .",
    "this is to be compared to the rate at which they thermally exchange energy with the gas , @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the thermal speed of the molecules . at a gas temperature @xmath255 , @xmath256 . assuming a post - shock density @xmath257 and a purely @xmath38 gas , the thermal exchange rate is only @xmath258 .",
    "that is to say , the absorption of heat energy from the gas only amounts to about 5% of a chondrule s overall energy budget ; 95% of its heating comes from absorption of the radiation from other chondrules .",
    "line emission can lower the temperature of the gas by a few k in the first few hours past the shock .",
    "say the temperature drop is 6 k : then the loss of heating from the gas amounts to about 3% of the chondrule s total heating , reducing the chondrule s temperature by @xmath6 1 k over the course of perhaps 3 hours .",
    "this is consistent with the difference in chondrule cooling rates @xmath259 we observed in the temperature range 1800 - 1900 k. at later times , as the gas and chondrules reach thermal equilibrium and line cooling shuts off more , the effect of line cooling on the cooling rates is lessened even further .",
    "line cooling is seen to have minimal effect on the cooling rates of chondrules melted in chondrule - forming shocks . even when the water abundance is increased by a factor of 10 ,",
    "chondrule cooling rates increase by only @xmath260 in our runs ( and an even smaller increase , @xmath261 , for chondrules ) .",
    "we attribute this primarily to two effects : the backwarming due to heat from surrounding regions radiating into the post - shock region ( which reduces line cooling ) , and especially the buffering effects of the heat released by the recombination of hydrogen molecules . had these effects not been considered , the gas temperature in the first few hours past the shock would have dropped by @xmath262 k more than we observed it to .",
    "the gas then would be significantly cooler than the chondrules , and would have produced a strong cooling effect on the chondrules .",
    "especially after a few hours , when the chondrules and gas are in thermal equilibrium , both components would have cooled to the background temperature , implying a cooling rate @xmath263 .",
    "the buffering effects of @xmath38 recombination prevent this scenario , reducing the effects of line emission , resulting in chondrule thermal histories almost identical to those without line cooling .",
    "previously , scott et al .",
    "( 1996 ) had suggested that dissociations of hydrogen molecules would limit the peak temperatures of gas and chondrules as thermal energy was used up breaking the bonds of @xmath38 molecules .",
    "our modeling confirms that , but also demonstrates the comparable magnitude of the recombinations of @xmath38 molecules .",
    "as atomic hydrogen recombines , the chemical energy released is converted into thermal energy , which buffers the cooling rate of the gas .",
    "our modeling suggests the cooling rates are reduced by up to one order of magnitude by this effect .",
    "we note that iida et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) considered hydrogen dissociations and recombinations in the energetics of the gas .",
    "significantly , though , they did not calculate the heating and cooling rates by considering a single equation for the rate @xmath264 or its inverse reaction . for dissociation , they used equation b6 of iida et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which considers dissociation of hydrogen molecules by collisions with @xmath38 , h , and electrons . for recombinations , they used equation b1 of iida et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which considered recombinations by three - body reactions ( @xmath265 ) and ionized species , but not three - body reactions involving hydrogen molecules ( @xmath266 ) . in most astrophysical settings in which hydrogen recombinations are considered , @xmath38 molecules are relatively rare , but in the nebular setting of chondrule - forming shocks , they are the dominant species . in any case , the reaction networks implicitly assumed by the formulas employed by iida et al .",
    "( 2001 ) do not match , and potentially could lead to spurious results . calculating the atomic fraction of hydrogen accurately is important because , as our calculations show , hydrogen recombinations can reduce the cooling rates by an order of magnitude .",
    "we find that the combined effects of backwarming and hydrogen recombinations mean that line cooling can increase the cooling rates of the gas , but only by about @xmath267 for standard parameters . the effect on the cooling rates of chondrules is even lower , amounting to only @xmath259 , typically .",
    "we find that the nebular shock model remains largely consistent with the thermal histories of chondrules . in the shock model ,",
    "chondrule precursors are initially at the low temperature necessary for the retention of primary sulfur , are heated rapidly to peak temperatures consistent with observational evidence , experience rapid initial cooling and then slower cooling through their crystallization temperatures , at rates consistent with experimental constraints on their thermal histories .",
    "one potential weakness of the shock model for chondrule formation , however , is that the shock wave model remains insconsistent with chondrule constraints regarding isotopic fractionation in the pre - shock region .",
    "recall that there is no indication of the isotopic fractionation in chondrules that would arise from the free evaporation of alkalis , which constrains the time spent at high temperature before melting ( tachibana et al .",
    "2004 ) to minutes or less ( tachibana & huss 2005 ) .",
    "we see no way around extended pre - heating of chondrules in a 1-d shock , because in 1-d a marshak wave must propagate into the pre - shock region .",
    "the marshak wave must propagate a number of ( infrared ) optical depths into the pre - shock region so that the radiative diffusion time is comparable to the travel time ; this implies optical depths @xmath262 .",
    "a higher opacity in the pre - shock region could reduce the time particles spend at high temperatures ; but the only way to achieve such high opacities is to have dust grains or an expectionally high density of chondrules .",
    "dust grains are virtually certain to evaporate completely in the pre - shock region in a chondrule - forming shock . on the other hand , the density of chondrules that would significantly increase the opacity are about 3 orders of magnitude more dense than the average density of solids in the solar nebula .",
    "an alternative solution is that the assumption of 1-d may be wrong .",
    "planetesimal bow shocks would not be large - scale structures that would generate a marshak wave that penetrates deeply into pre - shock region .",
    "further experimental work clarifying what the lack of isotopic fractionation means , as well as modeling of 2-d shocks , are warranted .",
    "such studies may discriminate between planetesimal bow shocks and gravitational instabilities as the sources of solar nebula shocks .",
    "one other constraint that is difficult to interpret in the context of the shock model is the recent discovery of primary na in olivine phenocrysts in chondrules .",
    "maintaining a high partial pressure of na vapor in the gas , as the chondrules cooled , is the only way to stabilize the chondrule melt against the loss of this volatile .",
    "although our model predicts evaporation of some fraction of the chondrule material ( @xmath268 ) , for typical nebular densities of chondrules , the chondrule vapor density is insufficient to stabilize the chondrule melt .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2008 ) invoke high concentrations of chondrules , @xmath269 times nebular densities , even though they acknowledge that the chondrule densities necessary are unrealistically high , based on our current understanding of the solar nebula .",
    "for example , settling to the midplane limits chondrule concentrations to @xmath270 , because higher concentrations induce shear instabilities and mixing that prevent further settling ( sekiya & nakagawa 1988 ) . models of turbulent concentration ( cuzzi et al .",
    "2008 ) do predict that chondrules should collect in clumps , some of which have concentrations @xmath271 , although only on scales @xmath272 km .",
    "such small regions are expected to be optically thin and cool too rapidly to be consistent with chondrule textures , but it must be admitted that the transfer of radiation in these regions can only be modeled in 2-d . in the context of the 1-d shock model , there is no way to explain the primary na in olivine phenocrysts in chondrules .",
    "as 2-d shock models are developed , however , we envision a possible explanation for the high partial pressure of na in chondrule - forming regions . building on the models of cuzzi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we assume there are regions of the nebula @xmath273 in extent , in which @xmath274 , which are surrounded by a  penumbra \" of lower concentrations ( @xmath275 ) on much larger scales , @xmath276 . this extended region is overrun by a shock of a given speed , say @xmath196 . as predicted by dc02 , and as shown by our results , higher @xmath179 regions would also result in higher peak temperatures and faster cooling rates ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for sufficiently high @xmath179 , dc02 have shown the concentrations in the heart of the clump are sufficient to completely evaporate all chondrules in the densest part , while only melting chondrules in the penumbral regions .",
    "in the hours during which melted chondrules are cooling and recrystallizing , they can come into contact with the chondrule vapor from the densest region .",
    "this could occur if the chondrule vapor can move outward , for example by pressure - driven expansion of the chondrule vapor , which can carry the vapor thousands of kilometers in a few hours .",
    "an alternative possibility is that chondrules are _ focused _ into the clumps . in clumps , chondrules are a significant fraction of the gas mass , increasing the overall density of material in this region , so the shock ends up propagating more slowly through the clump than the surrounding gas .",
    "the trajectories of chondrules entering the shock are refracted , and chondrules are focused into the clump , _",
    "after _ the clump has experienced its peak heating .",
    "therefore , some fraction of chondrules should experience otherwise normal thermal histories indicative of moderate chondrule concentrations , but in the presence of very high pressures of chondrule vapor that can only arise from regions of higher chondrule concentration .",
    "this scenario may resolve the quandary of alexander et al .",
    "because chondrules in the clumps totally evaporate , the requisite na vapor pressure can be met by evaporating a solids density in the post - shock region of only @xmath277 .",
    "this equates to about @xmath278 before the shock . for @xmath111-sized chondrules",
    ", this implies a chondrule density of @xmath279 and @xmath280 in the pre - shock gas .",
    "this is near the upper limit of chondrule concentrations thought attainable by turbulent concentration , but still achievable , and is consistent with the scenario envisioned here .",
    "a more quantitative analysis to test this hypothesis requires a shock code that can handle motions parallel to the shock front as well as radiative transfer in 2-d cylindrical geometry .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results of our updated shock model for chondrule foramation .",
    "we have described our updates to the hydrodynamic shock code of dc02 , correcting the problems with previous shock codes identified by desch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; namely , the appropriate boundary condition for the input radiation and the proper method for calculation of the opacity of solids , and the inclusion of a complete treatment of molecular line cooling due to water .    we have found that using the appropriate boundary condition for the input radiation , along with the proper calculation of opacities , including evaporation , have small but noticeable effects on the thermal histories of chondrules . especially because of the post - shock radiation boundary condition , the shock speed needed for chondrule melting increases slightly , from roughly @xmath182 ( dc02 ) , to @xmath196 .",
    "another difference , due to dust evaporation in the pre - shock region , is that the chondrules are exposed to high temperatures a longer period of time before they are melted ( @xmath2 4 hours , as opposed to @xmath6 30 minutes ) .",
    "significantly , we have found that molecular line cooling due to @xmath58does _ not _ have a significant effect on the cooling rates of chondrules , contrary to the calculations of insn and miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) and , indeed , the estimates made by morris et al .",
    "primarily this is due to the effect we call backwarming",
    ". the warm ( @xmath281 ) gas in the pre - shock region , and especially the hot ( @xmath282 ) gas immediately past the shock , radiate into the post - shock gas , heating it .",
    "this prevents the gas from cooling by line radiation until it has traveled to distances that are effectively optically thick to line radiation .",
    "a few key chondrule constraints remain mysterious in the context of the 1-d shock model ( such as the lack of isotopic fractionation and the discovery of primary na ) and demand 2-d simulations .",
    "although the shock model for chondrule formation certainly needs further refinement , we have presented a model which corrects the major problems identified by desch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , representing the most complete 1-d model of chondrule formation in nebular shocks .",
    "most important , we have included a complete treatment of the molecular line cooling due to water .",
    "this effect had been predicted to greatly increase the cooling rates of chondrules , by more than @xmath283 .",
    "in contrast , our detailed study shows that line cooling plays a negligible role in chondrule cooling rates .",
    "chondrule formation in nebular shocks is consistent with the detailed thermal histories of chondrules , with the nebular setting implied by chondrule - matrix complementarity , the repeatability of the chondrule - forming process , the inferred age difference between cais and chondrules , the compound chondrule frequency , the correlation between compound chondrule frequency and textural type , and many other constrains on chondrule formation .",
    "future challenges remain , especially identifying the source of the shocks : gravitational instabilities or planetesimal bow shocks . however , the evidence is overwhelming that chondrules formed by melting in shock waves in the solar nebula protoplanetary disk .",

    "this radiation can be absorbed by other @xmath23 molecules , or by solids .",
    "@xmath23 molecules can also absorb line radiation or continuum radiation .",
    "we calculate the transfer of line radiation using @xmath345 , the change in energy per time ( per area ) , due to line emission _ from _ the zone at index @xmath136 , _ into _ a different zone @xmath346 ( see figure  [ fig : grid ] ) .",
    "this rate depends on the rates of line emission , @xmath163 , and the density of water molecules , @xmath233 , in both zones , because water molecules in @xmath136 can emit to water molecules in zone @xmath40 , but they can also absorb the radiation from molecules in zone @xmath40 .",
    "the term @xmath345 also depends on the column density of water , @xmath162 , and the effective column density of solids , @xmath170 ( as defined in  3.2 ) , between the two zones .    in our numerical code ,",
    "gas quantities such as temperature , @xmath347 , are stored at positions labeled @xmath348 , where @xmath136 varies from 1 to @xmath349 , @xmath349 assumed odd .",

    "energy emitted by zone @xmath136 is assumed to be absorbed by another zone @xmath40 if line radiation can propagate to zone @xmath40 , but does not propagate into the next farthest zone ( @xmath358 if @xmath359 , or @xmath360 if @xmath361 ) .",
    "this depends on the water column densities between the two zones , or equivalently the difference in water column densities from the computational boundary ( at @xmath353 ) to zone @xmath136 and to zone @xmath40 , and likewise on the difference in solids column density between the two zones .",
    "the energy from zone @xmath136 absorbed in zone @xmath40 is linearly proportional to the water density in zone @xmath136 , @xmath362 , and the width of zone @xmath136 , @xmath363 .",
    "( it is understood that @xmath364 and @xmath365 . ) for various combinations of zones @xmath136 and @xmath40 , the formulas employed are as follows :            note that for each combination of zones @xmath136 and @xmath40 , the temperature @xmath347 is used to calculate the line emission from @xmath136 into @xmath40 .",
    "this means when calculating the reverse term , @xmath376 , the temperature @xmath43 will be considered ; if the temperatures in the two zones are identical , transfer of line radiation is possible only if the water densities differ .",
    "if the temperatures and water densities are identical in zones @xmath136 and @xmath40 , there will be no transfer of energy between them via line photons .",
    "significantly , water molecules in zone @xmath136 might be at high temperature and actively emitting line radiation , but they will not cool the region unless there is a cooler medium for that line emission to radiate into .",
    "one special circumstance that must be considered is the case where zones @xmath136 and @xmath40 lie on opposite sides of the shock front . in that case",
    ", the water molecules in the two zones will be sufficiently doppler shifted ( by roughly @xmath377 , far greater than the post - shock sound speed @xmath378 ) , that photons emitted by zone @xmath136 will not be absorbed by water molecules in zone @xmath40 , and vice versa . to account for this , when calculating @xmath379 , we effectively set @xmath380 in zones on the opposite side of the shock front , when calculating the water column densities . by doing so , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 in equation b2 . in this and the other equations , water molecules on the other side of the shock front from zone @xmath136",
    "are thus seen not to absorb radiation from zone @xmath136 .",
    "solids in zone @xmath40 , having a continuum opacity , can absorb these line photons , though .",
    "however , if there were no solids in zone @xmath40 , then @xmath379 would vanish .",
    "the net line cooling in zone @xmath136 is then given by @xmath383 it is this term that is then added to the gas energy equation ( i.e. , to the right - hand side of equation 23 of dc02 ) . except for the line radiation that crosses the computational boundaries , no energy emitted as line photons",
    "is lost from the computation .",
    "energy is for practical purposes conserved by this approach .",
    "( some energy can be lost , but only within a column density @xmath384 of the boundaries , or @xmath271 km of the boundaries ; but the input continuum radiation field prevents the gas from cooling there anyway . ) an important corollary is that if there are zones that experience a net cooling , there must be other zones ( at lower temperature ) that experience a net heating due to line radiation .",
    "our algorithm assumes there is no radiative exchange of energy between chondrules and water molecules in the gas .",
    "absorption of line photons by chondrules can be neglected only if they would contribute negigibly to the chondrule energy budget , and if the opacity of chondrules does not affect the transfer of line photons .",
    "line photons make up a negligible fraction of the total energy density of the radiation field : @xmath385 where @xmath386 refers to the opacity of chondrules , @xmath387 is the optically thin line photon emission rate , and @xmath388 refer to the mean free paths of line or continuum photons . assuming line photons travel a typical water column density @xmath389 , @xmath390 and @xmath391 , yielding @xmath392 .",
    "chondrules are overwhelmingly heated by absorbing continuum radiation ( and thermal exchange with the gas ) , not by absorbing line photons : including absorption of line photons would increase our estimates of chondrule temperatures by @xmath393 .",
    "likewise , chondrules do not affect the transfer of line photons , since the mean free path of infrared photons through chondrules is @xmath394 , much greater than @xmath395 .",
    "we also assume there is no absorption of continuum photons by water molecules .",
    "this is justified if these continuum photons do not affect the energy budget of the gas , and if absorption of continuum photons by gas does not affect the transfer of the continuum radiation field .",
    "while continuum photons overall dominate over line photons , photons with the specific wavelengths that water molecules can absorb are overwhelmingly produced by other gas molecules , not chondrules ( as evidenced from the fact that at the wavelengths absorbed by water , @xmath396 ) . neglecting these contributions",
    "is justified . finally ,",
    "while water molecules do absorb line photons effectively , 98% of the continuum radiation field is unaffected by the presence of water molecules , and transfer of this component is calculated adequately in our code .",
    "our approximations , which reduce the communication between the gas and chondrule fluids via radiation , are therefore justified . at any rate , effective coupling between gas and chondrules does exist in the code , and including more radiative coupling would have reduced the ability of chondrules to cool ."
