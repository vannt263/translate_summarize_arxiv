    "<S> in this paper we establish the uniform in bandwidth consistency for the transformation kernel estimator of copulas introduced in @xcite . to this end , we prove a uniform in bandwidth law of the iterated logarithm for the maximal deviation of this estimator from its expectation . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that , as @xmath0 goes to infinity , the bias of the estimator converges to zero uniformly in the bandwidth @xmath1 varying over a suitable interval . </S>",
    "<S> a practical method of selecting the optimal bandwidth is presented . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we make conclusive simulation experiments , showing the performance of the estimator on finite samples . </S>"
