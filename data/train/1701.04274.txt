    "anderson localization ( al ) is a single - particle disorder induced effect which leads to exponential localization of particles eigenfunctions @xcite . in his groundbreaking work , anderson considered non - interacting electronic gas in a tight - binding model in the presence of on - site disorder .",
    "since then , al was investigated in many different models , including off - diagonal disorder @xcite , disorder correlations @xcite , random fluxes @xcite , localization in the momentum space of classically chaotic systems @xcite and , recently , localization in the time domain @xcite .",
    "the interest in al renewed after the first experimental observation of the phenomenon in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "although the anderson model was created to describe electronic gases , al is difficult to observe in metals due to electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions . on the contrary",
    ", interatomic interactions can be switched off in a system of ultracold atomic gases trapped in optical lattice potentials @xcite .",
    "an optical lattice serves as an artificial , phononless crystalline structure , whose geometry and properties can be easily changed @xcite . therefore , in recent years , ultracold atoms in optical lattices have become a very important toolbox used to test diverse physical models and phenomena @xcite .",
    "the dimensionality of a system plays an important role in the context of al @xcite .",
    "in particular , in three dimesional ( 3d ) space a phase transition occurs at a critical energy , called the mobility edge , separating localized and extended states @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate al phenomenon in systems with non - integer dimension , i.e. in fractal lattices @xcite . whereas in euclidean space",
    "it is sufficient to define one kind of space dimension , in the case of fractals one needs to distinguish : the dimension of the embedding euclidean space  d , the hausdorff dimension @xmath0 and the spectral dimension @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "whereas the hausdorff dimension describes how the number of sites scales with the system size , the spectral dimension is related to a random walk on the lattice : the number of distinct sites @xmath2 visited by a random walker in @xmath3 steps scales as @xmath4 , provided that @xmath5 .",
    "the studies proved that it is the spectral dimension @xmath1 that is relevant in al and that @xmath6 is the lower critical dimension , below which all the states are localized in the presence of a disorder potential @xcite .",
    "another important theoretical model in study of localization properties is the quantum percolation model ( qp ) @xcite .",
    "anderson model describes particles in the presence of potential disorder ( purely diagonal ) , whilst qp involves the binary kinetic disorder ( purely off - diagonal ) . in qp models",
    "the disorder comes from random geometry : a qp lattice , which is a subset of the d - dimension lattice , arises by a removal of a number of sites or links with a probability @xmath7 ( being the only parameter of the model ) . despite its simplicity , qp models still arise controversies .",
    "the main concern is the question of existence of the localization - delocalization transition in 2d models for @xmath8 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", this issue might be important in the context of application of qp models in the description of transport properties in e.g. manganite films @xcite , granular metals @xcite and doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we investigate eigenfunction localization in random fractal lattices ( rfl ) , i.e. in fractal objects with random site connectivity in the absence of any diagonal disorder , fig.[fractal_pic ] .",
    "we would like to stress that qp systems do not belong to fractal objects .",
    "that is , in the qp case only an infinite cluster of a percolated lattice at the percolation threshold is a fractal object @xcite . here ,",
    "on the contrary , we consider a family of lattices with well defined hausdorff dimension @xmath0 @xcite . starting with the minimal , connected lattice ( i.e. a lattice without loops ) and adding links between nearest neighbors we can increase the spectral dimension @xmath1 of a lattice and keep the hausdorff dimension @xmath0 fixed .",
    "therefore , the main focus of this paper is to investigate the presence or absence of localization in rfls while changing the spectral and hausdorff dimensions independently .",
    "it is worth noting that the theoretical model investigated here can be realized in ultra - cold atoms laboratories where lattice geometry can be nearly arbitrarily shaped @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as fallows . in section  [ secii ]",
    "we describe the growth algorithm of random fractal lattices and how the spectral dimension changes when new lattice links are created . in section  [ seciii ]",
    "we focus on localization properties of rfls and on their dependence on the spectral and hausdorff dimensions .",
    "particularly , we analyze superlocalization resonances and formation of an energy gap which emerges in the system for small spectral dimension . in section  [ seciv ]",
    "we investigate transmission probabilities through the system and quantum evolution of initially localized particles .",
    "finally , in section  [ secv ] we conclude .",
    "we consider a family of lattices that we call _ random fractal lattices _ ( rfls ) , which first arose in a model of dielectric breakdown @xcite .",
    "the rfls are lattices with random site connectivity and with well - defined hausdorff @xmath0 and spectral @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the hausdorff dimension , or the capacity dimension , describes how the number of sites scales with the system size . in other words , if a lattice in fig .",
    "[ fractal_pic ] is a fractal object , then the number of sites inside a sphere o radius @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 , where in general @xmath0 is a noninteger exponent @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral dimension is related to a random walk on the lattice .",
    "the number of distinct sites @xmath2 covered in @xmath3 steps of a random walk is proportional to @xmath11 , if @xmath5 . from a general analysis ,",
    "the spectral dimension is never larger than the hausdorff dimension @xcite .",
    "rfls under consideration are embedded in the 2d euclidean space and have their hausdorff and spectral dimensions smaller than 2 .",
    "a minimal rfl , i.e. a lattice with the smallest number of lattice links , is a single connected lattice generated by the growth algorithm defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "a new lattice site @xmath12 is chosen and linked to the existing lattice at site @xmath13 with the probability [ probability ] p((i ,",
    "j)(i,j ) ) = , where the summation goes over all possible choices , @xmath14 is a free parameter and @xmath15 is a function fulfilling discrete laplace equation : _ i , j=(_i , j+1+_i , j-1+_i+1,j+_i-1,j )",
    ". [ laplace ] at start , we set @xmath16 everywhere . when a site @xmath12 is being connected to the lattice , then the value of @xmath17 is changed to zero .",
    "before linking another lattice site , the values of @xmath18 in the neighborhood of @xmath13 needs to be updated [ typically in 5 - 20 iterations of eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) ] .",
    "the algorithm is stopped after reaching @xmath19 lattice sites .",
    "the lattices grown in this manner have nonuniform geometry , both in the lattice sites and lattice links occurrence , as in fig .  [ fractal_pic ] . in particular , the two neighboring lattice sites do not necessarily need to be connected and the closed loops are forbidden , i.e. a minimal rfl is created . by adding links between nearest neighbors to a given minimal rfl , one opens up new possibilities for a random walker to explore and therefore increases the spectral dimension @xmath1 of the system while keeping the hausdorff dimension @xmath0 intact .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of rfls depends on the value of the parameter @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "for example , setting @xmath20 one can generate a minimal rfl with the hausdorff dimension @xmath21 and the spectral dimension @xmath22 .",
    "adding links to a minimal rfl results in an increase of the spectral dimension , fig .",
    "[ spectral_dim ] . at the same time",
    "the hausdorff dimension @xmath0 remains unchanged .",
    "in the following we analyze solutions of the schrdinger equation e_(i , j)=-_i,j_(i,j ) , [ schrod ] where @xmath13 denotes a position on a rfl embedded in the 2d euclidean space and the sum runs over nearest neighbor sites if there is a link between @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the tunneling amplitudes of a particle between neighboring sites and the planck constant are equal unity .      in our analysis",
    "we investigate two distinct scenarios :    * first , we fix the hausdorff dimension by setting @xmath20 in , which corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "then , we change the spectral dimension in the range between 1.33 and 1.55 by adding links to the minimal rfls , see fig .",
    "[ spectral_dim ] .",
    "* in the second scenario , we do the opposite , i.e. we fix the spectral dimension ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) and change the hausdorff dimension by varying the parameter @xmath14 in .    in order to explore the presence or absence of localization of eigenfunctions of a particle in rfls , we use a convenient method engaging the energy level statistics obtained via direct diagonalization of finite systems @xcite .",
    "since the localized states usually have very small overlaps ( as they may be localized in different parts of the system ) , the energy levels can be nearly degenerate .",
    "this is why the localization of eigenstates can be observed directly from the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we expect that in the localized phase the energy level statistics follow the poisson distribution , and in the delocalized phase fulfill the wigner dyson distribution @xcite .",
    "having the ordered spectrum of energy levels @xmath25 , we can calculate a quantity [ ri_eq ] r_i = , where @xmath26 .",
    "next , we average the results over 2000 realizations of rfl and over neighboring energies @xmath27 .",
    "the distinction between the two regimes is possible since for the poisson distribution @xmath28 localized phase ) and for the wigner dyson distribution @xmath29 ( delocalized phase ) @xcite .    to investigate the localization properties of wavefunctions under the change of the spectral dimension of rfls , we plot @xmath30 in fig",
    ".  [ phase_diag ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the vertical axis expresses the spectral dimension via the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 , see fig .",
    "[ spectral_dim ] .",
    "the panel illustrates strong dependence of the localization properties on the spectral dimension @xmath1 . while increasing the spectral dimension we observe a smooth transition from the localized to delocalized phase , what is evident in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] , where the averaged ratio @xmath30 is plotted for two extreme values of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we observe nonmonotonous dependence of @xmath30 on energy ( i.e. the localization is stronger near the edges and the center of the spectrum ) , which has been also observed in qp models @xcite .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] we present @xmath30 for a few different hausdorff dimensions @xmath0 and very similar spectral dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the data with different @xmath0 do not differ significantly apart from the edges of the spectra .",
    "the results show that , similarly to the al models @xcite , it is the spectral dimension @xmath1 that is the relevant dimension in the context of the localization properties of the system .      in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] we can observe a peculiar narrow energy gap @xmath32 around @xmath33 for @xmath34 , which eventually closes up when the spectral dimension is being increased .",
    "we find that the value of energy gap @xmath32 for the minimal rfls ( i.e. @xmath22 ) of length @xmath35 is [ energy_gap_value ] = 0.1140.017 .",
    "the energy gap decreases slightly in larger systems , however , it seems that @xmath32 survives in the thermodynamical limit , see fig .",
    "[ energy_gap_fig ] . in order to illustrate",
    "the energy gap more clearly we show in fig .",
    "[ pr ] the participation ratio @xmath36 pr(e ) = _ ( i , j ) |(i , j ) | ( e)|^4 , where @xmath37 is an eigenstate corresponding to an energy @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a state localized at a lattice site denoted by @xmath13 in the 2d euclidean space . the participation ratio is yet another measure of the localization @xcite .",
    "that is , the inverse of @xmath40 estimates a number of fractal points on which an eigenstate is localized on .",
    "what is the most striking in fig .",
    "[ pr ] is the emergence of peaks that are related to superlocalization resonances also observed in the qp model @xcite .",
    "the resonances appear for a discrete set of energies @xmath41 and they are dominant for @xmath42 .",
    "the presence of the resonances is not visible in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] because in eq .",
    "the degenerate levels are discarded to avoid divergence .",
    "the name _ superlocalization _ stems from the fact that the eigenstates localize on very small ( a few lattice site ) disjoint clusters .",
    "for example , a zero energy state can be localized on two sites only , as long as a certain building block appears on the lattice boundary . in fig .",
    "[ superlocalization_fig ] ( a ) we see a block with one vertex and four lattice sites . note , that its zero energy eigenstate has non - zero values on two sites only and the other two sites form an _ , , empty leg_. now notice , that a structure in fig .",
    "[ superlocalization_fig ] ( c ) must have similar zero energy eigenstates because connecting empty lattice to an empty leg of a block like in fig .",
    "[ superlocalization_fig](a ) does not change a zero energy eigenstate localized on two sites . therefore ,",
    "if a lattice geometry allows for small blocks ( like e.g. in panel ( a ) or ( b ) of fig.[superlocalization_fig ] ) , then some eigenstates of the lattice coincide with those of small blocks and superlocalization resonances emerge .",
    "if some blocks are frequently occurring in the lattice , the corresponding superlocalization resonances can be extremely degenerate .",
    "for example , for the minimal rfls with @xmath21 about 10% of eigenstates have zero eigenenergy .",
    "the zero energy manifold is thus extended over a substantial number of lattice points that is related to the appearance of the energy gap in the spectrum .",
    "that is , the zero energy manifold is large and other eigenstates with non - vanishing overlap on the manifold must necessary possess different energies .",
    "the four - site structure shown in fig .",
    "[ superlocalization_fig](a ) has also non - zero energy eigensolutions , for instance corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "however , such eigenstates do not have an , , empty leg  and therefore if the block is connected to an empty big lattice , these eigenstates are disturbed .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to build a 3-vertex block , see fig .",
    "[ superlocalization_fig](b ) , where there are eigenstates corresponding to @xmath43 which possess , , empty legs  and are not disturbed when the block is attached to a big empty lattice . such a 3-vertex structure is far less common in rfls , which explains low abundance of the @xmath43 superlocalization resonance ( less then 1 ) .",
    "in this section we investigate transport properties of a quantum particle on rfls : transmission probability through the lattice and evolution of a particle initially localized on a single lattice site . here",
    ", we focus on small systems with 500 lattice sites only because smaller systems are closer to the experimental reality in ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "the transmission probability from site @xmath9 to site @xmath44 of a  quantum particle with the energy @xmath38 is defined @xcite as : t(r , r,e)= | r |g^+(e)| r|^2 , where @xmath45 denotes average over different realizations of rfl , @xmath46 is the retarded one - particle green s function @xcite .",
    "we plot the transmission probability throughout considered lattices , i.e. between the most distant sites , in fig .",
    "[ transmisja_fig ] .",
    "the top panel presents the dependance of the transmission probability on energy for different spectral dimension of rfls whereas in the bottom panel there are transmission probabilities averaged over entire energy spectra for different number of links in the system . in an agreement with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] , we observe a drastic reduction ( 5 orders of magnitude ) of the transport while decreasing the number of links in the system ( bottom panel ) .",
    "furthermore , we can see a number of strong dips in the plot of @xmath47 ( top panel ) , especially for @xmath48 .",
    "these dips correspond to the energy gap around @xmath33 and the superlocalization resonances for discrete degenerate energies , see fig .",
    "the most pronounced dips are related to : @xmath33 ( about 10% of all energy levels correspond to @xmath33 ) , @xmath49 ( 4% ) and @xmath50 ( 1% ) .",
    "note , that an increase of @xmath31 ( black dashed and red solid curves in the top panel ) narrows the dip around @xmath33 significantly down because the gap is disappearing .",
    "furthermore , the transport properties of a quantum particle can be investigated more directly by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation i_t _ ( i , j ) = -_i,j _ ( i,j ) , cf .",
    "( [ schrod ] ) .    in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ ewolucja_fig ] we present the snapshots of the evolution of a quantum particle in lattices for the two extreme cases : the minimal and the maximal number of links for a given geometry . in panels ( c ) and ( d ) the time averaged results are shown .",
    "starting from the same initial , fully localized ( on a single lattice site ) state , we obtain the opposing results : the probability density of finding a particles is either localized around the initial state or explores the whole lattice .",
    "we have investigated localization and transport of a quantum particle in lattices with a fractal structure .",
    "the lattices consist of points that form a connected cluster .",
    "sites of the lattices are generated so that their fractal ( hausdorff ) dimension @xmath0 is controlled .",
    "independently one can control the spectral dimension @xmath1 of the systems by choosing how many nearest neighbor sites are linked to a given lattice point .",
    "it allows us to analyze how the localization properties vary with independent changes of the hausdorff and spectral dimensions .",
    "analysis of energy level statistics and participation ratio of eigenstates shows that while the localization properties depend very weakly on @xmath0 , they change strongly with @xmath1 .",
    "for the smallest spectral dimension of the systems we observe strong localization of eigenstates . with an increase of @xmath1 ,",
    "eigenstates loose their localization properties and become extended over the entire finite lattices that we consider .",
    "disorder in our systems stems from a non - uniform distribution of lattice points and from their random connections . when @xmath1 approaches @xmath0 all nearest neighbor sites become connected and the randomness is related to the non - uniform distribution of lattice points only .",
    "the latter introduces too weak de - phasing and eigenstates do not localize .",
    "we observe also eigenstates that are strongly localized on small parts of the random fractal lattices .",
    "the smaller part of the fractal , the higher chance for such eigenstates to occur .",
    "the zero energy eigenstates can occupy two sites only and consequently they form the largest degenerate manifold . at low spectral dimension",
    "they are so many that an energy gap around @xmath33 is created .",
