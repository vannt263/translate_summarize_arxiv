    "one of the biggest cosmological mysteries is the accelerating cosmic expansion which was discovered by the observations of distant type ia supernovae ( snia ) starting from more than 10 years ago . for the origin of the accelerating expansion",
    ", the following possibilities have been proposed : the modified gravity such as @xmath2 gravity@xcite , brane - world cosmology  @xcite , inhomogeneous cosmology  @xcite , and existence of unknown energy called as dark energy which is equivalent to a cosmic fluid with a negative pressure .",
    "it is strongly suggested that the dark energy amounts to 70% of the total energy density of the universe from the astronomical observations such as snia @xcite , the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , and the baryon acoustic oscillation  @xcite . although there are various theoretical models of dark energy ( details are shown in a review @xcite ) , its physical nature is still unknown .",
    "considering above - referenced observations , we can not exclude the constant @xmath3 term which is the most simple model of dark energy .",
    "the interacting dark energy with cmb photon has been discussed , wherea decaying vacuum into photon is related to a primordial light - element abundances  @xcite and the cmb intensity  @xcite . from the point of the thermodynamical evolution in the universe , a decaying vacuum energy modifies the temperature - redshift relation  @xcite .",
    "this modification affects the cosmic thermal evolution after a hydrogen recombination  @xcite , such as formation of molecules  @xcite and the first star  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this model , the angular power spectrum of cmb could be also modified  @xcite . in the previous analysis , thermal history at the higher redshift has been studied . however , as seen in @xcite , the time variation of temperature at low redshift differs from the model without a decaying - vacuum    in the present study , we update the observational consistency of a vacuum energy ( hereafter we denote as @xmath3 ) coupled with cmb photon .",
    "hereafter we call this model d@xmath3cdm ( model ) . to examine the consistency with observations at low redshift , we focus on the cosmic evolution comparing both the type ia supernovae and the redshift dependence of cmb temperatures .",
    "this is because the time dependence of the cmb temperature for a d@xmath3cdm differs from cdm model with a constant @xmath3 term of which hereafter we call s@xmath3cdm ( model ) . in  2 formulation of d@xmath3cdm",
    "is reviewed . in ",
    "3 the @xmath4 relation is investigated for d@xmath3cdm in a flat universe .",
    "parameters inherent in this model are constrained from the cmb temperature observations in  4 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in  5 .",
    "the einstein s field equation is written as follows  ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant and @xmath7 is the energy momentum tensor . if we assume the perfect fluid , @xmath7 is written as follows : @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the energy density and the pressure , respectively . note that we choose the unit of @xmath11 .",
    "the equation of motion is obtained with use of the friedmann - robertson - walker metric of the homogeneous and isotropic principle : @xmath12 ,   \\label{aaa}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the scale factor and @xmath14 is the specific curvature constant .",
    "this leads to the friedmann equations : @xmath15    from the conservation s law of energy , we can obtain the equation of the energy density : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the coefficients of the equation of state , @xmath18 , and defined by @xmath19 we take the component of the energy density as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath3 indicate photon , neutrino , non - relativistic matter ( baryon plus cold dark matter ) , and the vacuum , respectively . here",
    "we neglect the energy contribution of @xmath3 on other components except for photon : the @xmath22 and @xmath23 evolves as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . from eq .",
    ", the equation of the photon coupled with @xmath3 is written as @xmath26 let us define the parameter of the energy density as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the critical density defined by the present hubble constant @xmath29 .",
    "we can rewrite eq . as follows  ( details also see @xcite ) : [ p14_dn ] + @xmath30 models with time",

    "note that the present value of @xmath34 is expressed by @xmath35 .",
    "integrating eq .   with eq .",

    "the best fit parameter region of @xmath54 for @xmath96 is investigated as @xmath97 at @xmath98 confidence level  ( c.l ) .",
