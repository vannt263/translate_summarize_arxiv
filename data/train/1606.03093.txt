    "by examining the interaction of dead zone and active zone gas in this controlled manner , we are able to better understand the physical effects that are observed in the simulations .",

    "the equations of resistive mhd in the shearing box approximation are ,    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    here @xmath26 is the gas density , @xmath27 is the magnetic field , @xmath28 is the total pressure ( related to the magnetic field and the gas pressure , @xmath29 , via @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 is the identity tensor , @xmath32 is the velocity , @xmath2 is the ohmic resistivity , and @xmath33 is the shear parameter defined by @xmath34 , which is @xmath35 in this case of a keplerian disk .",
    "an isothermal equation of state with a constant sound speed @xmath36 is used , @xmath37 we use a standard set of boundary conditions appropriate for the shearing box approximation . at the azimuthal boundaries we exploit the symmetry of the disk and apply periodic boundary conditions . at the radial boundaries we apply shearing periodic boundaries , such that quantities that are remapped from one radial boundary to the other are shifted in the azimuthal direction by the distance",
    "the boundaries have sheared relative to each other at the given time @xcite . in the vertical direction , we employ the modified outflow boundary condition of @xcite , which are the standard outflow boundaries but with the gas density extrapolated exponentially into the ghost zones ; this method reduces the artificial build - up of toroidal magnetic flux near the vertical boundaries .",
    "such outflow boundaries can lead to significant mass loss , particularly in the case of strong vertical magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "however , such drastic mass loss is not observed in our simulations , consistent with expectations from our magnetic field geometry as described below . in general , these boundary conditions can break conservation , so methods described in @xcite are used in order to keep the correct variables conserved .",

    "a density floor of @xmath43 is applied to keep the alfvn speed from getting too high ( and thus the time step too small ) in the region far from the mid - plane .",
    "the density floor also prevents @xmath44 ( defined below ) from getting too low , which can cause numerical problems .",
    "we set the constant isothermal sound speed @xmath45 , and choose the angular velocity to be @xmath46 , which gives @xmath47 .",

    "the saturation level of mri - driven turbulence is known to be a function of the net vertical magnetic flux @xcite , which can additionally give rise to outflows @xcite and to qualitatively distinct hall physics @xcite . here , our primary goal is to study the relationship between active layer turbulence and motions induced by this active layer in an idealized model of the dead zone , for which the actual saturation level of the mri is of secondary importance .",
    "for simplicity , and to reduce the parameter space that needs to be studied , we therefore choose a field geometry with no net vertical magnetic flux .",
    "consistent with this choice , we do not observe strong mhd outflows from our simulations .    in order to seed the mri",
    ", we apply random perturbations to the gas pressure and velocity . following the procedure used by @xcite , the perturbations are uniformly distributed throughout the box and have zero mean .",
    "pressure perturbations are a maximum of @xmath51 of the local pressure , and velocity perturbations are a maximum of @xmath52 .",

    "five simulations were done , varying the ratio of the surface density of the active zone @xmath54 to the total surface density @xmath55 .",
    "the surface density of the active layer is physically set by a balance between recombination and ionization from sources such as cosmic rays @xcite , x - rays @xcite , and fuv photons @xcite . in most circumstances",
    "this balance is achieved on time scales that are shorter than the turbulent mixing time between the surface and the interior of the disk @xcite .",
    "it is then a reasonable approximation to ignore time - dependent ionization effects , and take the column of ionized gas to be fixed in space and time .",
    "varying the active to total surface density ratio is thus equivalent to changing the size of the dead zone .",
    "physically , the resistivity varies with column density as a smooth function whose form is set by the details of the ionization - recombination balance . to more accurately study the scaling of dead zone properties with dead zone size",
    ", however , we ignore this complexity and instead create a simple dead zone by imposing a sharp vertical transition in the ohmic resistivity using an error function .",

    "note that @xmath61 is specified by the initial conditions and remains fixed throughout the simulation , it is _ not _ adjusted on - the - fly to account for changes in the instantaneous vertical density distribution .",
    "depending upon the ionization source ( cosmic rays or x - rays ) the ratio of active to total column at 1  au in a purely ohmic dead zone model is expected to be of the order of 0.1 to @xmath62 , if the underlying disk has a surface density comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "substantially smaller values of the order of @xmath63 are possible if mass accumulates in the dead zone , as occurs in some models for episodic accretion @xcite .",
    "as we show later , however , modeling extremely thin active layers is numerically challenging , because the time scale for kinetic energy in the dead zone to saturate becomes prohibitively long .",
    "with this constraint in mind , we are able to reliably model dead zones whose active to total column varies between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the specific values of this ratio , along with the corresponding values of @xmath61 , are shown in table  [ tabsizes ] .",

    "( the dead zone maxwell stress also continues to evolve for a long time , but at such a low level as to be physically uninteresting . ) as we will discuss later , the bulk of the kinetic energy is associated with non - turbulent fluid motions , and hence the kinetic energy evolves in a distinctly different manner to the reynolds stress . to quantify how the saturation time scale depends on the dead zone thickness",
    ", we take the most conservative ( slowest saturating ) measure and define the saturation time to be when the average mid - plane kinetic energy did not increase by more than 3 percent over 20 orbits .",
    "the saturation time increases as the mass of the dead zone increases relative to the active zone , as shown in figure  [ figsattime ] and table  [ tabresults ] .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the expectation that energy and turbulence are being generated in the active layer and injected into the dead zone , so that a larger dead zone takes longer to saturate .",
    "however , the detailed evolution of the kinetic energy as a function of time ( both for the dead zone shown in figure  [ figtimeevo ] and the other runs ) proved hard to fit with a simple quantitative model of energy injection plus damping . clearly , though , some physically realistic dead zones  for which the ratio of the active to dead mass might be as low as @xmath63  would require very long simulations , with well - controlled numerical dissipation  to model faithfully .",
    "having defined the saturation time for the different dead zone sizes , we compute time - averaged vertical profiles of the reynolds and maxwell stresses using data from the remaining portion of the runs .",
    "these stress profiles are plotted in figure  [ figprofiles ] .",
    "the mid - plane maxwell and reynolds stresses both decline as the thickness of the dead zone increases , but the maxwell stress is always negligible . only the reynolds stress is interesting for physical purposes .        if reynolds stress in the dead zone derives exclusively as a consequence of energy transported there from the active zone , then its magnitude ought to be set by an equilibrium between energy injection from the active zone and damping ( which might be turbulent dissipation in the dead zone , or leakage of dead zone energy back into the active zone ) .",
    "we therefore expect a scaling of the mid - plane reynolds stress with the ratio of the mass in the active zone to that in the dead zone .",
    "the derived scaling is shown in figure  [ figreynoldsplot ] .",
    "a linear fit to the @xmath82-@xmath83 relation provides a good description of the numerical results at the disk mid - plane . as can be seen in figure  [ figprofiles ]",
    ", however , the mid - plane stress becomes extremely small for the thickest dead zone , and this is reflected in the linear fit predicting that the mid - plane stress goes to zero at finite dead zone thickness .",
    "we do not expect this to be strictly correct , but the results suggest that ohmic dead zones have physically negligible mid - plane stresses once the active zone column becomes less than or of the order of 1% of the total disk column .",
    "the ratio of reynolds stress to kinetic energy ( ke ) is indicative of the efficiency of angular momentum transport .",
    "the ratio is defined as ,    @xmath84    where the brackets indicate an average over a given spatial volume .",
    "table  [ tabresults ] contains this efficiency diagnostic for the different runs , time averaged in the saturated state .",
    "the dead zone spatial average is taken from from @xmath85 @xmath86 to @xmath78 , while the active zone is from @xmath85 @xmath87 to @xmath80 .",
    "these limits were maintained across the runs to compare like quantities .",
    "the efficiency in the active zone is about @xmath88 , independent of the size of the dead zone , while the efficiency in the dead zone scales strongly with the size of the dead zone .",
    "the ( hydrodynamic ) transport efficiency for the medium sized dead zone is about an order of magnitude less than in the active region , where ideal mhd conditions apply .",
    "there is a substantial further decline for the larger dead zones .",
    "the large kinetic energy content of the dead zone is thus largely irrelevant as far as angular momentum transport goes , implying some combination of ( a ) non - turbulent motions and ( b ) turbulence that at the mid - plane is inefficient at transport .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have used local numerical simulations to study the structure of ohmic dead zones , that may be relevant to accretion in protoplanetary disks @xcite and in the outer regions of dwarf novae @xcite . by setting up a simplified , yet well - defined model",
    " that ignores the role of other non - ideal processes and has a sharp transition between magnetically active and inactive zones  we were able to run long duration simulations at high resolution in order to precisely quantify how dead zone properties scale with the thickness of the dead zone .",
    "we found that :    * the reynolds stress , which dominates transport near the mid - plane , scales strongly with the thickness of the dead zone . for modest dead zones ,",
    "in which the ratio of magnetically active to inactive column is of the order of 0.1 or higher , we find @xmath89 .",
    "thicker dead zones , in which the active column is only of the order of 1% of the total mass , have negligible mid - plane stresses . as a result , small dead zones can have accretion rates that are a significant fraction of the active zone accretion rate ( @xmath90 to @xmath91 ) , while larger dead zones have accretion rates around @xmath92 of the active zone rate .",
    "this scaling supports models in which mass can accumulate in the dead zone region , building up a reservoir of material that can potentially accrete rapidly @xcite . *",
    "the structure of turbulence in the mri - active region , at high @xmath66 , resembles that seen in ideal mhd simulations of fully active disks @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic component of the turbulence becomes more axisymmetric and less efficient at angular momentum transport towards the mid - plane , especially for thick dead zones . *",
    "the time scale for saturation of the kinetic energy in the dead zone is long ( reaching @xmath93 orbits for the thickest dead zone studied ) .",
    "most of the kinetic energy is contained in large - scale , non - turbulent fluid motions , which take the form of an oscillatory meridional circulation that is extended in the vertical direction .",
    "similar fluid motions were observed in independent simulations by @xcite .",
    "we identify this motion with the lowest order r mode expected in a purely hydrodynamic disk model @xcite .",
    "* we expect the properties of the large - scale fluid motions to depend upon the nature of the perturbations ( isothermal or adiabatic ) , and upon where vertical driving of the mode occurs . moreover , the standing waves observed in our shearing box simulations would likely be replaced by inwardly and outwardly propagating waves in a global disk model .",
    "however , if models similar to those we observe are excited to significant amplitudes in more physical models of protoplanetary disks , the resulting buckling of settled particle layers could reduce the efficiency of pebble accretion for small ( @xmath94 ) particles .",
    "although purely ohmic dead zones are an idealization , the inclusion of non - ideal physics in disk simulations frequently leads to vertical stratification of turbulent properties , and regions of the disk where mid - plane mhd stresses are negligible , as we have seen here .",
    "further simulations will be needed to determine if our results for the scaling of reynolds stresses , and for the excitation of large scale fluid flows , carry over under more realistic conditions .",
