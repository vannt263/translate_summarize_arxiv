    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) experiments based on strong coupling of a single anharmonic emitter to a cavity - mode have lead to the observation of the photon blockade effect where photon - photon interactions alter the statistics of light emitted by the cavity .",
    "experimental results showing nonlinearities at the single - photon level have recently been achieved in both atomic@xcite and solid - state qed systems@xcite with single cavities .",
    "motivated by the success of single - cavity qed experiments , center of attention has now shifted to the exploration of the rich physics promised by strongly - correlated quantum optical systems in multi - cavity and extended photonic media .",
    "several works have recently considered this possibility : a photonic version of the bose - hubbard model with an array of nonlinear cavities@xcite , the realization of the tonks - girardeau regime of interacting bosons in a non - linear optical fiber@xcite , and a photonic analogue of the kondo effect in a 1d waveguide@xcite .",
    "most of the existing proposals have focused so far on strongly - correlated photonic systems in the quasi - equilibrium regime for which dissipation is essentially negligible . in most realistic cavity - qed structures on the other hand",
    ", dissipation does play a substantial role and it is very difficult to fix the photon number . when photon losses can not be neglected , the system reaches a stationary state given by the balance of dissipation and driving .",
    "we propose here an optical analogue of the superconducting josephson interferometer , which we name the _ quantum optical josephson interferometer _ , revealing new features due to the genuine non - equilibrium interplay of coherent tunneling and on - site interactions .",
    "the two variants of the device we are presenting couple a central nonlinear cavity to two external driving lasers through either two side cavities ( fig .",
    "1a , b ) or two waveguides ( fig . 1d ) .",
    "the three - cavity system can be generalized to an n - cavity system with the central nonlinear one@xcite ( fig .",
    "1c ) , and in the limiting case of very large",
    "n this reduces to the single cavity coupled to two side - waveguides ( fig .",
    "1d ) . in both cases ,",
    "the coupling to the side cavities ( or waveguides ) is a consequence of photon tunneling .",
    "we assume the center - cavity can be tuned to have a sizable single - photon nonlinearity , e.g. due to some radiation - matter interaction effect , be it jaynes - cummings - type dynamics ( with a single atom or quantum dot in the center cavity )  @xcite , giant kerr nonlinearity  @xcite , or 0d polariton interaction ( e.g. , with a quantum well embedded in the center - cavity )  @xcite .",
    "the model discussed here is quite general and can be realized in a variety of quantum optical systems . in the following",
    "we show that light emitted from the center cavity is the result of two competing effects , tunneling and interactions , leading to a crossover between the coherent and strongly correlated regimes . in the coherent regime",
    ", photons are delocalized over the three cavities and the emitted light is strongly dependent on the phase difference between the two pumping lasers ( josephson oscillations ) . in the strongly correlated regime ,",
    "the inhibition of photon number occupation beyond fock states @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the center cavity reduces the quantum coherence between the two outer ones .",
    "the suppression of josephson oscillations in the emitted light is accompanied by a crossover from poissonian to sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "the main thrust of the present work is to investigate the crossover from coherent to correlated regimes of this intrinsically non - equilibrium system by detecting light emitted from the center cavity .",
    "we show that photon correlation measurements reveal features of an interacting few - body system that are not captured by more traditional transport - type measurements .",
    "in fact , the device we propose has close analogies with a phase - biased cooper pair transistor . in the latter",
    ", the critical current can be electrostatically modulated by changing the gate potential on the central island connected to two superconducting reservoirs@xcite .",
    "the interplay between coherent tunnel coupling and on - site interactions in these systems has been utilized in many ground - breaking experiments , ranging from the observation of a quantum phase transition in josephson junction arrays@xcite to the direct demonstration of number - phase uncertainty in superconducting islands@xcite .",
    "while the operation of both electronic and photonic versions is based on the quantum mechanical conjugation between phase and number variables , the quantum optical josephson interferometer is an intrinsically open system .",
    "given the enormous impact of the josephson devices in electronics , from metrology to quantum information processing , we expect that the quantum optical josephson interferometer might constitute the building block for a new class of quantum optical devices .",
    "in the absence of losses the three cavity setup depicted in fig .",
    "1a , b is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 written in the rotating frame with respect to the frequencies of the two pumping lasers ( @xmath3 ) . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath4 are the detunings of the coherent pump lasers whose amplitudes are @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are assumed time - independent ( cw pumping ) .",
    "we will characterize the three cavity system by analyzing the response of the center - cavity as a function of the phase difference @xmath7 .",
    "the two couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 quantify the hopping strength between neighboring cavities and the nonlinear photon coupling in the center - cavity , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath10 describe noninteracting bosonic fields in the external cavities , i.e. free cavity photons , while the elementary excitations in the center - cavity are interacting polaritons denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "both the tunneling and the coherent pumping act on purely photonic degrees of freedom , e.g. @xmath8 is due to the overlap of the photonic part among nearest neighbors cavities . a rigorous derivation of the model in eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) inevitably depends on the specific system under consideration , and has been provided before in the context of atomic@xcite or solid - state@xcite cavity - qed implementations .",
    "readily accessible schemes for achieving large photon - photon interactions are based on resonant coupling of a single emitter to a cavity mode ( i.e. the jaynes - cummings model ) .",
    "as we detail in the supplementary information section ( `` experimental feasibility '' ) , the principal features we obtain using the model ( [ hamilton ] ) are qualitatively identical to those predicted by the jaynes - cummings model - type single - photon nonlinearity .",
    "the dynamics of the full model , eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) , is effectively equivalent to that of two coupled bosonic fields : one is coherently driven , while the other is nonlinear ( see methods section ) . from now on we consider for simplicity the case of equal detunings and resonant pumping , @xmath12 .",

    "it is instructive to first consider the case in which there is no interaction ( @xmath20 ) , where an exact analytical solution for the steady state of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) can be obtained .",
    "the case of equal amplitudes of the two driving lasers ( @xmath21 ) and equal losses in the three cavities ( @xmath22 ) captures all the essential details of the non - interacting case . in steady state",
    "the average number of photons in the central cavity @xmath23 is found to be @xmath24 this is an analog of josephson oscillations , imprinted in the light emitted from the center - cavity , due to the interference between the two coherent driving fields .",
    "two features of this solution are to be noticed for a comparison with the more interesting @xmath25 situation treated below .",
    "first , the size of the oscillations is maximized at @xmath26 , as a result of an interplay of dissipation and interference . moreover , while @xmath27 is suppressed and eventually goes to zero for @xmath28 , the oscillations keep a cosine - like behavior as a function of @xmath29 .    in fig .  2 , we present our numerical results for experimentally accessible observables of the system when the interaction is switched on ( @xmath30 ) . rescaled quantities @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 are defined for the effective two - cavity model as outlined in the methods section .",
    "do the josephson oscillations in @xmath33 , as measured by detecting the light emitted from the center cavity ( fig .",
    "1b ) , remain intact ?",
    "2a , we plot @xmath33 for various values of the interaction at a pumping strength of @xmath34 .",
    "the size as well as the functional form of the oscillations barely change as @xmath35 is varied across a wide range of values , under these weak pumping conditions .",
    "this picture changes dramatically when we pump the system stronger , shown in fig .",
    "2b for @xmath36 . here , the average population in the center - cavity can be sizeable and nonlinear effects are more pronounced .",
    "in contrast to the weak pumping case ( fig .",
    "2a ) , the size of the oscillations is suppressed to a great extent as @xmath9 is increased .",
    "besides the strong suppression of visibility , fig .",
    "2b shows a dramatic deviation from the cosine - like functional form , eq .",
    "( [ solutionueq0 ] ) , as @xmath35 is increased from zero ( the behavior for @xmath37 is shown in the inset ) .    .",
    "we plot the first few total photon number manifolds in the range @xmath38 to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the various @xmath41 manifolds are marked on the vertical axis and set off from each other by an arbitrary @xmath42 for visibility .",

    "for this , in fig .",
    "2c we plot the zero - time delay second - order correlation function @xmath45 ( see methods section ) as a function of the scaled quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we find that @xmath45 displays a sharp transition from poissonian to sub - poissonian light statistics as the interaction strength @xmath9 is increased .",
    "the threshold for anti - bunched ( sub - poissonian ) light generation , @xmath48 , is a function of @xmath8 . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the anti - bunching threshold is @xmath50 , while for @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "these two regimes are connected by a smooth crossover region .",
    "this peculiar behavior of the anti - bunching threshold is related to the effective dissipation rates of the coupled system as the coupling strength @xmath31 is varied . at small @xmath31 , the coupling to the center cavity is perturbative ; the nonlinearity ( i.e. antibunching ) therefore sets in when @xmath9 is larger than the broadening of the bare center cavity polariton states i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath31 is increased , the coupling becomes non - perturbative and the relevant eigenstates of the coupled system are superpositions of center and outer cavity states ; such dressed states have broadening contributions coming from both center and outer cavities and therefore the nonlinearity now has to be larger than the broadening of the dressed states in order for the system to exhibit antibunching .",
    "a remarkably simple expression for @xmath54 can be derived in the weak pumping limit ( see discussion in supplementary information section ) which captures all the regimes discussed : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these results are consistent with the expectation that strong photon nonlinearity can lead to photon - blockade @xcite in the center cavity giving rise to anti - bunching .",
    "while the _ relative _ strength of @xmath9 with respect to tunnel coupling @xmath31 seems to matter at small couplings @xmath58 ( i.e. @xmath59 is a monotonic function of @xmath31 ) , at larger @xmath31 the relative effect of @xmath9 saturates .",
    "an interesting feature that does not leave any footprint in these two observables considered is the nature of the system s effective non - linearity . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the deviation of the system energy levels from a harmonic structure is linearly proportional to @xmath9 , and this determines the main behaviour of @xmath61 . for @xmath62",
    "however , the center cavity acts as a two - level system ( only @xmath63 and @xmath64 photon states available ) , which is coupled to the linear cavities with strength @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the coupled system maps onto an effective jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model where , surprisingly , the tunnel coupling strength plays the role that is commonly played by the atom - cavity dipole - coupling in the original jc model  @xcite . in fig .  3",
    ", we show how this comes about : two levels of each constant photon - number manifold ( @xmath65 ) split off from the rest of the levels to form a jc - sequence as @xmath9 is increased beyond @xmath31 .        in the limit of an infinite number of linear cavities coupled on either side to the center cavity ( fig .",

    ", the nonlinearity ( i.e. anti - bunching ) sets in when @xmath9 is larger than the broadening of the bare center cavity polariton states i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "much more interesting is the fact that at larger hoppings the threshold scales with @xmath8 , in contrast to the case of three cavities ( fig .",
    "the crossover from bunching to antibunching behavior reflects in a clear way the crossover from delocalized to localized states .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased , the relevant eigenstates of the coupled system are superpositions of center and outer cavity states .",
    "when @xmath74 photon states are delocalized over the whole systems while in the opposite case the states are fock states due to the onset of photon blockade .",
    "one may also understand the dependence of the crossover on @xmath8 by relating it to the low-@xmath8 limit of fig .",
    "2c : from the perspective of the center cavity , the driven waveguide is analogous to a driven cavity with a dissipation rate larger than all other energy scales .    due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation ,",

    "( [ hamilton_mf ] ) is replaced by a two - level system coupled with a driven cavity mode @xmath76 which agrees with the numerical results .",
    "the broadening of the dip at @xmath77 is proportional to @xmath78 implying that the visibility goes to zero by increasing the field ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath80 is again witness of the crossover from the delocalized to the correlated regimes . for large hopping",
    "the state of the system is approximately a coherent state .",
