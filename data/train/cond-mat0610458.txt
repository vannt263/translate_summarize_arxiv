    "consequently , we measured the temperature dependence of the linewidth with the magnetic field oriented along the @xmath33- and the @xmath34  axis ( shown together with the x - band data in fig .",
    "[ esrparameters](b ) ) at a higher frequency of 185  ghz and a correspondingly higher magnetic field .",
    "note that the increase is maximal for the magnetic field applied along the @xmath34 direction in contrast to the expectation resulting from the analysis of the @xmath2 tensor .",

    "eventually , such a discrepancy might be found in many low - dimensional compounds and it appears a challenging experimental and theoretical task to identify and classify common parameters of such systems .",

    "<S> we investigated the magnetic properties of the system cute@xmath0o@xmath1 by susceptibility and electron spin resonance measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the effective @xmath2-factors and the esr linewidth indicates that the anticipated structural dimer does not correspond to the singlet - forming magnetic dimer . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spin susceptibility of cute@xmath0o@xmath1 can only be described by taking into account interdimer interactions of the same order of magnitude than the intradimer coupling . analyzing the exchange couplings in the system we identify the strongest magnetic coupling between two cu ions to be mediated by super - super exchange interaction via a bridging te ligand , while the superexchange coupling between the cu ions of the structural dimer only results in the second strongest coupling . </S>"
