    "interest in the construction of effective hamiltonians to relate macroscopic properties of materials to microscopic information has recently increased dramatically .",
    "construction of an effective lattice hamiltonian is greatly facilitated by the use of a localized basis for the description of crystal structure distortions .",
    "for example , structural phase transitions in perovskite and rocksalt structure systems have been studied using model hamiltonians with a `` local mode '' basis to describe the unstable lattice modes relevant to the transition .",
    "while in earlier work the microscopic model parameters had to be determined empirically , @xcite recent advances in the accuracy and efficiency of first - principles bandstructure and total energy methods have made it possible to calculate these parameters directly from first principles , and encouraging agreement with experimentally observed transition properties has been obtained.@xcite in addition , the study of electronic properties of systems which exhibit lattice instabilities coupled to the electronic states is facilitated by the description of the lattice in a localized basis , putting it on an equal footing with the usual tight - binding description of the electronic states.@xcite however , the approximate `` local mode '' basis is expected to be inadequate for high - accuracy first - principles investigations .",
    "furthermore , explicit construction of a localized basis set and optimal effective hamiltonian has proved to be especially problematic for complicated crystal structures and structural transitions involving modes at the zone boundary or interior of the zone .    in this paper , we present a systematic procedure for the construction of an effective lattice hamiltonian in a localized basis set , applicable to arbitrary systems and structures and specifically designed for practical use in first - principles studies .",
    "this approach is suitable for the investigation of a general phonon - related structural transition , @xcite involving a small change in structure which can be generated by freezing phonon displacements into a high - symmetry prototype structure .",
    "we implement this procedure for structural transitions in the perovskite , rocksalt , fluorite and a15 structures .",
    "group theoretical methods , which since landau @xcite have been central to the phenomenological study of structural phase transitions , are essential to our development of a procedure which is systematic and easy to implement for arbitrary structures and transitions .",
    "the resulting localized basis vectors are the lattice analogue @xcite of electronic wannier functions.@xcite these wannier basis vectors span an invariant subspace containing the low - frequency normal modes relevant to the transition .",
    "this subspace is energetically decoupled at quadratic order from the higher frequency eigenmodes , permitting the construction of an effective hamiltonian for the transition including only lattice distortions in the subspace .",
    "the model parameters for a particular material can be obtained using any method that can reliably calculate force constants and distortion energies . for the force constant calculation ,",
    "the most efficient high - accuracy method is density - functional - theory ( dft ) linear response.@xcite as we will see , once the force - constant matrices have been calculated , an effective hamiltonian can be constructed with very little additional effort .",
    "the final result is a model system which reproduces the finite - temperature transition behavior of the original lattice hamiltonian , while the simpler form and reduction in the number of degrees of freedom per unit cell make it suitable for study by methods such as mean field theory and monte carlo simulation .    in the next section",
    ", we present the derivation of the effective hamiltonian in a symmetrized localized ( wannier ) basis . in section iii , we discuss in detail the construction of the wannier basis and resulting effective hamiltonian for the simple example of the diatomic chain . in section iv , this construction is generalized to arbitrary structures and applied to the structural transitions in perovskite compounds .",
    "in addition , the results of the construction for the rocksalt , fluorite and a15 structures are briefly described .",
    "section v is a discussion of the practical implementation of this approach in a first - principles framework , illustrated by application to the ferroelectric transition in @xmath0 .",
    "finally , section vi summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "consider a crystal with @xmath6 atoms per unit cell and @xmath7 unit cells with born - von karman boundary conditions .",
    "each possible configuration of the crystal is fully described by specifying the generalized displacement of each ion ( i.e. the displacement multiplied by the square root of the ion mass ) relative to a fixed high - symmetry reference structure , which should be chosen so that the physically important configurations are obtained by small distortions . in general",
    ", this will be the same as the structure of the high - symmetry phase .",
    "the set of all ionic displacement patterns forms a @xmath8-dimensional vector space , called the  ionic - displacement space . \" in the standard basis , in which each basis vector is the unit displacement of a single ion in a single cartesian direction , the coordinates of a particular configuration are the generalized displacements @xmath9 .",
    "another basis for the ionic - displacement space is obtained from the normal modes @xmath10 . in this basis , the coordinates @xmath11 are complex numbers , with the understanding that the ionic - displacement pattern is obtained by taking the real part of the vector @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 transform according to irreducible representations of the space group of the high - symmetry reference structure @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the action of translation through a lattice vector is @xmath15 .    for the construction of an effective hamiltonian",
    ", we perform a decomposition of the ionic - displacement space into invariant subspaces , called `` band subspaces , '' spanned by one or more entire branches of the normal modes and closed under @xmath14@xcite each band subspace in this decomposition should be minimal in the sense that it can not be written as the direct sum of two band subspaces .",
    "the number of band subspaces is @xmath16 and they are indexed by @xmath17 , with the number of branches in each subspace @xmath18 , indexed by @xmath19 ( note that @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xmath18 will also be referred to as the multiplicity of the band subspace .    for each band subspace @xmath17 , we seek a localized basis set with definite symmetry properties with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "these properties are established by choosing a wyckoff symbol for @xmath14 , of multiplicity @xmath21 , and an @xmath22-dimensional irreducible representation ( irrep ) of the corresponding site symmetry group.@xcite the choice of wyckoff symbol and site symmetry group irrep is constrained by the requirement that the representation of @xmath14 defined by the localized basis have the same decomposition into irreps of @xmath14 as the particular band subspace @xmath17 for which a basis is being sought .",
    "specifically , a set of basis vectors @xmath23 is associated with a particular site in the crystal ( the ith wyckoff position added to the lattice vector @xmath24 ) and is a set of partner functions of the chosen irrep of the site symmetry group .",
    "these basis vectors are localized , with ionic displacements decaying rapidly with distance from the associated site .",
    "the basis vectors associated with the other sites of the chosen type are generated by acting on the given basis vectors with symmetry operations from @xmath14 .",
    "for example , subsets of localized basis vectors are related to each other by translation through a lattice vector @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , the product of the number of wyckoff positions @xmath21 and the dimension of the site symmetry group irrep @xmath22 must equal the multiplicity of the band subspace @xmath18 , and we replace the former two indices by a combined index @xmath26 .",
    "the decomposition of the localized basis representation of @xmath14 into irreps of @xmath14 can be computed from formulas such as equation 14 in ref . or by computing , for various @xmath27 , the character table of @xmath28 in the subspace of bloch sums .",
    "usually , the appropriate choice of wyckoff symbol and site symmetry group irrep can be determined just from the space group irrep labels of the eigenmodes at the high - symmetry points .",
    "the basis vectors from each band subspace in the decomposition can be combined to form a basis for the full ionic displacement space . in this basis ,",
    "the coordinates of a particular configuration are the real numbers @xmath29 , which determine the ionic - displacement pattern as the vector @xmath30 .",
    "these localized basis vectors are the lattice analogue @xcite of electronic wannier functions.@xcite the symmetry properties of the wannier basis vectors lead to a convenient form for the taylor expansion of the lattice energy in the corresponding coordinates , allowing easy identification of independent parameters .",
    "furthermore , the expansion has the important feature that it contains no quadratic cross terms between different band subspaces .",
    "extra considerations apply when the various branches of normal modes include some with polar character and/or are not well separated in energy ; these will be discussed in section v.    with this basis set , the derivation of an effective hamiltonian proceeds as follows .",
    "the classical partition function for the lattice is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 runs over the @xmath33 atoms , the electron degrees of freedom have been eliminated through the born - oppenheimer approximation , and the generalized ionic displacements @xmath34 are measured relative to a high symmetry reference structure , as described above .",
    "the momentum integral leads to a trivial @xmath35-independent factor and is not explicitly written here .",
    "it is straightforward to change variables in @xmath36 from standard basis coordinates @xmath34 to wannier basis coordinates @xmath37 and taylor expand @xmath36 around the reference structure . by construction ,",
    "the quadratic part @xmath38 decouples into a sum over the band subspaces : @xmath39 where @xmath40    the next step is to choose a band subspace or direct sum of band subspaces as the symmetry - invariant subspace in which the effective hamiltonian will act .",
    "this subspace should be as small as possible , yet should include all modes which have higher - order terms in the expansion of @xmath41 which are important in describing low - energy configurations , and which therefore can not to a good approximation be dropped from the expansion in the evaluation of the partition function near the transition . for the calculation of thermodynamic behavior at temperatures in the vicinity of the structural transition , it is essential to include higher order terms for the branches containing the unstable modes associated with the transition .",
    "strain degrees of freedom may not have important anharmonicity in themselves , but still have physically important higher - order coupling to the unstable modes , and thus should be considered for inclusion in the subspace . here and in the rest of this section , we write the expressions for the case that the effective hamiltonian acts in a single band subspace @xmath42 , since generalization to the case of the direct sum @xmath43 is straightforward .",
    "the correct choice of subspace permits the following approximation to @xmath41 : @xmath44 within this approximation , anharmonic terms appear _ only _ in @xmath45 and , by construction , there are _ no _ cross terms between @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",
    "this has the important consequence that the integration over the degrees of freedom not included in the effective hamiltonian subspace can be performed analytically . specifically , the partition function integral factorizes into an integral over @xmath42 and another over @xmath46 .",
    "the integral over @xmath46 is an elementary gaussian integral which leads to a temperature - dependent factor unimportant for the structural transition .",
    "the remaining integral has the form of a partition function for a system of @xmath47-component spins on a lattice @xmath48 , which recovers the original partition function @xmath49 : @xmath50    an explicit expression for @xmath51 is obtained by making a taylor expansion in symmetry invariant combinations of the @xmath52 .",
    "this expansion is greatly facilitated by the symmetry properties of the wannier basis .",
    "an expression with a finite number of undetermined parameters is obtained by setting expansion coefficients beyond a certain range or order to zero or writing them in a parametrized form .",
    "the resulting spin - like model is suitable for statistical mechanical analysis via mean field theory , monte carlo simulation , or other appropriate method .",
    "the values of the expansion coefficients are different for different materials and are to be obtained from first principles calculations , as will be discussed in section v.",
    "in this section , the explicit construction of the effective hamiltonian in a localized wannier basis will be presented for the simple example of the diatomic chain.@xcite this calculation demonstrates most , though not quite all , of the important principles , including the determination of the symmetry properties of the wannier basis vectors .",
    "the remaining generalizations for application to arbitrary structures will be made in section iv .",
    "the high - symmetry reference structure of the `` ionic '' diatomic chain model we consider has lattice constant @xmath53 and ions a and b at positions @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , respectively .",
    "the potential energy in our model is given to quadratic order in @xmath57 , the displacements from the reference structure , by @xmath58 \\label{chain}\\ ] ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ abchain_fig ] . in the rest of this section , we set the masses of the ions @xmath59 = @xmath60 = 1 and the ratio @xmath61 .",
    "analytical diagonalization of the dynamical matrix at each @xmath62 in the first brillouin zone yields two branches ( @xmath63 ) with eigenvalues @xmath64 , shown in fig .",
    "[ abmodes_fig ] .",
    "the normal modes are labelled by the irreps of the space group @xmath65 .",
    "these are @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 , and @xmath62 otherwise .",
    "it can be seen that the ionic displacement space of the diatomic chain decomposes into two band subspaces @xmath72 , each spanned by the nondegenerate eigenmode branch of corresponding @xmath73 .",
    "since the number of branches in each subspace is one , we drop the index @xmath19 .",
    "as we have seen in section ii , construction of an effective hamiltonian involves the choice of an invariant subspace .",
    "this subspace should be a band subspace ( or direct sum of band subspaces ) which includes all modes relevant to the particular transition being modelled . in the diatomic chain example , we imagine that the relevant mode is @xmath70 . the band subspace @xmath74 has the symmetry label @xmath70 , while the band subspace @xmath75 has the symmetry label @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the subspace in which the effective hamiltonian will act is @xmath74 .",
    "if instead the relevant mode were @xmath69 , the corresponding effective hamiltonian subspace would be @xmath75 .    for the chosen effective hamiltonian subspace @xmath74 or @xmath75 , we seek a localized basis set labelled by a unit - multiplicity wyckoff symbol and a one - dimensional irrep of the corresponding site symmetry group , since both band subspaces are of unit multiplicity .",
    "the space group of the diatomic chain has two wyckoff symbols of unit multiplicity : @xmath76 , ( at x=0 ) , and @xmath77 ( at x=1/2 ) . for both @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",
    "the site symmetry group is @xmath78 , with two one - dimensional irreps @xmath79 ( even ) and @xmath80 ( odd ) .",
    "the space group representations defined by each of the four distinct labels ( @xmath76,@xmath79 ) , ( @xmath76,@xmath80 ) , ( @xmath77,@xmath79 ) and ( @xmath77,@xmath80 ) decompose at the high - symmetry k - points @xmath68 and @xmath71 into the space group irreps ( @xmath81,@xmath82 ) , ( @xmath83,@xmath84),(@xmath81,@xmath84 ) , and ( @xmath83,@xmath82 ) , respectively .",
    "since the space group irrep labels of the localized basis set must match those of the band subspace throughout the brillouin zone , we find that for both band subspaces the label of the wannier basis is uniquely determined . for @xmath74",
    ", it is ( @xmath76,@xmath80 ) , and for @xmath75 , it is ( @xmath77,@xmath80 ) .",
    "since individual ionic displacements are a localized basis with the required symmetry properties for the full ionic displacement space , it might seem that the wannier basis vectors would always be obtained from occupied wyckoff positions combined with vector representations of the site symmetry group , as in the diatomic chain example .",
    "in fact , this is not the case .",
    "the simplest example in which this can be seen is the `` molecular '' diatomic chain.@xcite for the present discussion , we consider the closely related triatomic chain model in fig . [ triatomic_fig ] .",
    "the high - symmetry reference structure has lattice constant @xmath53 and ions a at positions @xmath54 and ions b at positions @xmath85 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the space group is the same as that of the `` ionic '' diatomic chain discussed above .",
    "the space group irreps for the normal modes at the high - symmetry k - points are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath67 at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "all space group irreps at the two points are compatible , so depending on the details of the potential , four types of branches defining unit - multiplicity band subspaces can appear .",
    "the wannier basis of the band subspace ( @xmath67 , @xmath70 ) is labelled by ( @xmath76,@xmath80 ) , so that the basis vectors transform like ionic displacements at occupied wyckoff positions .",
    "however , the wannier basis of the band subspace ( @xmath66 ,  @xmath69 ) is labelled by ( @xmath76 , @xmath79 ) and the wannier bases of the two `` mixed - label '' band subspaces ( @xmath67 ,  @xmath69 ) and ( @xmath66 ,  @xmath70 ) are labelled by the unoccupied wyckoff position @xmath77 , midway between the two b atoms , and the site symmetry group irreps @xmath80 and @xmath79 , respectively . for the triatomic chain , with an appropriate choice of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , it may happen that there will be two band subspaces of the ( @xmath67 ,  @xmath70 ) type .",
    "both will be described by wannier basis vectors with labels ( @xmath76,@xmath80 ) , but the wannier basis vectors for the two band subspaces will be orthogonal to each other .    for the complete construction of an effective hamiltonian , it is not enough to know the symmetry properties of the basis vectors ; rather , an explicit expression for the wannier basis vectors in terms of ionic displacements is needed .",
    "the basis vectors are determined by the potential energy and resulting set of normal modes which define the band subspace .",
    "if the normal modes are known at all @xmath62 , the basis vectors can be obtained exactly . for each @xmath17 ,",
    "the expression for @xmath88 , the wannier basis vector centered in unit cell @xmath54 , in terms of @xmath89 is @xmath90 an inverse transform can be performed to express the @xmath89 in terms of the wannier basis vectors : @xmath91 in evaluating equation [ abwann ] , the phase function @xmath92 can be freely chosen to maximize the localized character of @xmath88 , with the only constraint being the requirement that the resulting wannier basis vectors have the desired symmetry properties .",
    "for the diatomic chain , the normal modes are easily obtained at all @xmath62 .",
    "we follow the convention that the real part of the 2-component eigenvector @xmath93 of the 2x2 dynamical matrix at each @xmath62 gives the displacements of the a and b ions in the unit cell @xmath94 .",

    "@xmath98 can be chosen to satisfy @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 and to be smooth functions of @xmath62 , ensuring that the corresponding normal mode @xmath102 smoothly depends on @xmath62 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "we choose @xmath103 such that @xmath104 is real and positive for all @xmath62 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting wannier basis vector @xmath106 is shown in fig . [ aodd_fig ] .    except in special cases such as the diatomic chain , knowledge of the normal modes at all @xmath62 is not available and the expression in equation [ abwann ] can not be used to construct the wannier basis vectors .",
    "however , a good approximation can be obtained from knowledge of the eigenvectors at a subset of k - points through a fitting procedure which will prove to be practical for use with first - principles calculations . for a particular choice of wyckoff symbol and site symmetry irrep",
    ", a parametrization of the displacement pattern of the wannier basis vectors is obtained from symmetry considerations .",
    "for example , for the wannier basis ( @xmath76 , @xmath80 ) of the @xmath74 subspace of the diatomic chain , the displacement of the central ion is given by one real parameter and each pair of ions equidistant from the center requires an additional real parameter to specify the equal displacements ( see fig .",
    "[ aodd_fig ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the wannier basis vector , starting with the innermost coordination shells , are then fit to reproduce a set of known normal modes in the band subspace . since the wannier basis vector is localized , it should be a good approximation to set the displacement parameters to zero beyond a finite number of shells .",
    "for example , in the diatomic chain , the simplest nontrivial truncation is at the first shell . for @xmath74 , the fit to the eigenvector at @xmath68 yields the approximate wannier basis vectors @xmath107 with displacements @xmath108 for the central a ion and @xmath109 for the first shell of b ions .",
    "the frequencies corresponding to the approximate normal modes @xmath110 , computed from eqn .",
    "[ chain ] and shown in fig . [ abwapp_fig ] , agree very well with the true frquencies if the nonorthonormality of the basis vectors is taken into account . with the inclusion of just one more shell of a ions in the approximate wannier basis vector to fit the normalized eigenmode at @xmath71 shown in fig .",
    "[ abmodes_fig ] , it is nearly indistinguishable from the exact wannier basis vector on the scale of fig .",
    "[ aodd_fig ] and unit normalization to within a few percent is achieved throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "this construction also illustrates the point that the choice of phases for the eigenmodes is important in producing a well - localized wannier basis vector . in this case , if the normalized eigenmode at @xmath71 were multiplied by @xmath111 , the approximate wannier basis vector would have larger displacements on the first a coordination shell than on the central a ion .    using the symmetry properties of the wannier basis vectors ,",
    "the form of the effective hamiltonian can be written as an invariant expansion of the energy in the wannier basis coordinates of the subspace .",
    "we now consider the diatomic chain with effective hamiltonian subspace @xmath74 .",
    "since these coordinates have the same transformation properties as individual ionic displacements of the a ions , the effective hamiltonian parameters can be put into direct correspondence with the familiar force constants of the monoatomic chain or with tight - binding parameters for a system with one @xmath112 orbital per unit cell . truncating the expansion at fourth order in onsite terms and at quadratic order and second neighbor in intersite terms yields : @xmath113 + \\sum_{n , n ' s.t .",

    "anharmonic parameters such as @xmath124 are obtained from calculation and fitting of full potential energies for finite distortions .    in the study of structural transitions ,",
    "focus on a simple description of a relevant mode at a particular k - point has occasionally led to a choice of localized basis vectors inconsistent with this symmetry criterion . as will be discussed in section iv ,",
    "a common example is the use of a rotational variable to describe the @xmath125 instability in perovskites .",
    "the negative consequences of inconsistent symmetry can be simply illustrated in the diatomic chain .",
    "the displacement pattern of the @xmath69 mode ( fig .",
    "[ abmodes_fig ] ) can be obtained with localized basis vectors not only of the type ( @xmath77,@xmath80 ) but also ( @xmath76,@xmath79 ) , the latter being inconsistent with the symmetry criterion . as shown above",

    "the problems encountered when using an inconsistent symmetry choice in the construction of the effective hamiltonian can be understood using equations [ abwann ] and [ abwanninv ] .",
    "wannier - like basis vectors inconsistent with our symmetry criterion can be constructed only if the requirement that the inverse transforms ( equation [ abwanninv ] ) reproduce _ normalized _ normal modes is lifted and zero normalization allowed . in equation [ abwann ] , this corresponds to multiplying the phase factor @xmath127 by a real function @xmath128 .",
    "for example , wannier - like functions of the type ( @xmath76,@xmath79 ) for the upper branch ( @xmath75 ) can then be obtained with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the inverse transforms reproduce the eigenmodes @xmath131 , not normalized to one except at @xmath71 .",
    "the energy written in terms of the fourier transform of the wannier basis coordinates @xmath132 is @xmath133 effective hamiltonian parameters can be fit as above to reproduce the dispersion @xmath134 . in particular , at @xmath68 , the parameters must be fit to zero energy . to use material - specific information at @xmath68 ,",
    "it is necessary to expand the model dispersion to leading order in @xmath135 and to fit the coefficient of @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "the approximate wannier basis vector construction can also be carried out as above except at @xmath68 , where it is necessary to expand the approximate eigenmode to leading order in @xmath62 and to fit the coefficients to @xmath138 . with @xmath139 , required to eliminate the inconsistent condition on the phases at @xmath68 , the resulting localized basis is linearly dependent and can not reproduce the normal mode at @xmath68 .",
    "this amounts to eliminating the point @xmath68 from the ionic displacement space . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the behavior of the system should not be affected , since in the partition function configuration integral , this is a set of measure zero . however , in a finite - size simulation , the integral is replaced by a sum , and the incorrect description of the system arising from the linear dependence leads to an @xmath140 error . if transformation properties consistent with our symmetry criterion are chosen and the normalization requirement imposed , these finite - size simulation errors and the unnecessary complications in the first - principles fitting procedure are avoided .",
    "in this section , we generalize the construction of the effective hamiltonian to arbitrary structures and apply it to phonon - related structural transitions in the perovskite , rocksalt , fluorite and a15 structures",
    ". we will use as our primary illustration the example of the perovskite structure . among the many compounds in this structure ,",
    "a rich variety of phonon - related structural transitions are found.@xcite these can be analyzed in a unified systematic framework using the present approach .    the cubic perovskite structure , which will be taken as the high - symmetry reference structure , has five atoms per unit cell and space group @xmath141 .",
    "the first step in the effective hamiltonian construction is a symmetry analysis to identify the band subspaces ( i.e. minimal invariant subspaces spanned by one or more entire branches of normal modes ) .",
    "once the space group irrep labels for the ionic - displacement space have been determined , a complete list of the band subspaces and the corresponding wannier basis labels can be obtained by the following general procedure , valid for arbitrary structures .",
    "first , all possible symmetry types of band subspaces are constructed using the compatibility relations between the irrep labels at the high - symmetry @xmath27-points .",
    "the corresponding wannier basis labels are found by considering in turn eachwyckoff symbol with each irreducible representation of the corresponding site symmetry group such that the product of the number of the wyckoff positions with the dimension of the site symmetry group irrep is less than or equal to the maximum multiplicity of the band subspaces .",
    "a particular combination will label a wannier basis of a band subspace if the space group irrep labels produced at the high - symmetry @xmath27-points match those of the band subspace.@xcite application of this procedure to the perovskite structure yields four band subspaces , all labelled by occupied wyckoff positions with vector representations , corresponding to atomic displacements .",
    "these are listed in table i.    as in the case of the diatomic chain , a parametrization of the displacement pattern of the wannier basis vectors can be obtained from symmetry considerations . for each band subspace ,",
    "the procedure is ( 1 ) choose one of the wyckoff positions specified by the label ; ( 2 ) identify the symmetric coordination shells surrounding that site ; and ( 3 ) compute the independent displacement patterns of each shell that transform according to the given irreducible representation of the site symmetry group . for each of the four band subspaces of the perovskite structure ,",
    "the displacement patterns for the innermost coordination shells are shown in fig .",
    "[ pattern_fig ] .",
    "the relative amplitudes of each independent displacement pattern for each shell are free parameters determined by the requirement that a particular branch or branches of normal modes be reproduced , and thus will be different for individual materials .    as we have seen in section ii , construction of an effective hamiltonian involves the choice of an invariant subspace as the direct sum of one or more band subspaces .",
    "the effective hamiltonian subspace should include all modes relevant to the particular transition being modelled .",
    "the smallest subspace satisfying this condition , and therefore the maximum possible reduction in the degrees of freedom , can be identified by listing the symmetry labels of the relevant modes and choosing a direct sum of the band subspaces of the ionic - displacement space which produces the desired labels .",
    "there are cases in which there is more than one minimal choice which satisfies the conditions .",

    "the next step is the construction of the wannier basis vectors for the subspace @xmath42 .",
    "the strategy is to fit independent displacement parameters for the innermost coordination shells to the normalized eigenvectors at only the high - symmetry @xmath27-points ( with adjustment of the eigenvector phases to obtain optimally rapid decay ) .",
    "since the wannier basis vector ionic displacements generally decay rather rapidly with distance from the central ion , this is sufficient to determine an excellent approximation to the wannier basis vector . in the example of the diatomic chain , discussed in section iii , it was sufficient to fit only the @xmath68 and @xmath71 modes .",
    "the application to ionic insulating crystals , including @xmath0 , requires additional comment .",
    "if @xmath42 contains a degenerate polar @xmath68 mode and there are polar @xmath68 modes not included in @xmath42 , ( as , for example , in the perovskite structure @xcite ) , the electric field at @xmath186 mixes the lo modes differently from the to modes , and a single wannier basis vector can not faithfully reproduce both the transverse and longitudinal branches . therefore , the normal modes of the corresponding longitudinal branch should _ not _ be used in constructing the approximate wannier basis vector .",
    "the correct approach is to use only the low energy ( transverse ) branches to determine the approximate wannier basis vector .",
    "for @xmath0 , we use displacements of the central , first and second neighbor pb ions and the nearest ti and o shells , for a total of nine independent parameters ( six of which are included in fig .",
    "[ pattern_fig ] ) to reproduce the normalized lowest - frequency normal modes @xmath143 , @xmath185 and @xmath183 and the normalization of the @xmath184 mode exactly .",
    "the amplitudes of the displacements are found to decay rapidly , as expected .",
    "moreover , the @xmath182 and @xmath184 normal modes predicted from the parameters obtained from the fit are in excellent agreement with the corresponding normalized normal modes calculated from first principles.@xcite    the form of the effective hamiltonian is obtained by taylor expanding the potential energy in symmetry invariant combinations of the @xmath187 and approximating to obtain an expression with a relatively small number of effective hamiltonian parameters which can be determined from the available information . for the quadratic part of the effective hamiltonian , this will mean that intercell interactions of the most general form are included only up to a finite range . for @xmath0 ,",
    "we include general intercell interactions up to third neighbor ( eight independent parameters ) .",
    "the long - range dipolar interactions required for the correct description of polar modes can be included in a parametrized form , requiring only knowledge of the born effective charges @xmath188 and the dielectric constant @xmath189 , which can be obtained from separate linear response calculations or from energies of distortions with @xmath190 close to zero .",
    "similarly , a small number of higher order terms must be selected so as to ensure stability and a ground state configuration of the correct type . in @xmath0 ,",
    "only onsite anharmonic terms are needed .",
    "lastly , in a cubic system such as @xmath0 , inclusion of the coupling to homogeneous strain introduces only a few additional parameters .    the calculation of the parameters in the effective hamiltonian exploits the fact that a given set of wannier basis coordinates uniquely determines the positions of the ions .",
    "the quadratic parameters are obtained by fitting to the frequencies of a set of modes in the effective hamiltonian subspace computed from first - principles force - constant matrices at the high - symmetry points @xmath27-points and at @xmath27-points along selected symmetry lines . in @xmath0 , we compute @xmath188 and @xmath189 from dft perturbation theory , and fit the eight short - range interaction parameters to the following effective hamiltonian eigenmodes : @xmath191 and the @xmath192 modes at @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the truncations in the taylor expansion of the quadratic effective hamiltonian can be checked by computing force constant matrices at additional @xmath27 . with linear response , this overdetermination of parameters is relatively easy , while it can be quite impractical in supercell calculations . in the same way",
    ", anharmonic terms can be obtained from fitting the higher - order dependence of first - principles total energies on the amplitude of the wannier basis coordinates .",
    "lastly , the homogeneous strain terms are obtained by computing the dependence of total energies of configurations on variations in the lattice parameters .",
    "the approximate wannier basis vector approach can be applied successfully even if the branches of interest are not fully isolated in energy from other branches , which are recognizable by distinct symmetry labels . even in this case , a simple model , with the effective hamiltonian acting in the @xmath42 subspace , should still give accurate results for finite - temperature properties if the @xmath195 branches cross only the higher - energy portions of the @xmath42 branches , preferably at @xmath27-points far from the @xmath27 of the relevant phonon . in that case , the approximate wannier basis vector is fit using only the normalized eigenvectors at @xmath27-points where the @xmath42 branches can be distinguished from the @xmath195 branches by their symmetry labels .",
    "this set of @xmath27-points will typically be the same as the set of high - symmetry @xmath27-points prescribed in the general procedure for approximate wannier basis vector construction .",
    "similarly , at other @xmath27-points , energies of the approximate eigenvectors built up from these approximate wannier basis vectors are computed from force constant matrix results and used to determine effective hamiltonian parameters .",
    "therefore , application of the approximate wannier basis vector approach essentially projects out the @xmath195 character at the low - symmetry @xmath27-points , which amounts to ignoring the crossing .",
    "if a substantial amount of crossing occurs into the lower energy range , if all the relevant modes are not contained in a single band subspace , or if anharmonic coupling to modes outside the relevant band subspace is important , it will be necessary to enlarge the effective hamiltonian subspace to include the additional branches by working with a direct sum @xmath196 .",
    "for each band subspace , there is an independent wannier basis vector to be determined by fitting eigenvector information .",
    "if the approximate wannier basis vectors exactly reproduce all branches at all calculated @xmath27-points , then in the invariant energy expansion there are no cross terms between coordinates from different band subspaces .",
    "if this is not the case ( for example , for the polar modes discussed above ) cross terms must be included in the invariant energy expansion and explicitly determined from the force constant matrix information .",
    "if the subspace containing the relevant modes contains no polar modes and is well separated in energy from the higher - energy eigenmodes , there is an alternative approach which bypasses the explicit construction of the wannier basis vectors altogether by applying the philosophy of tight - binding parameterization of electronic energy bands.@xcite in that case , we assume the existence of underlying wannier basis vectors and fit directly to the eigenvalues to obtain effective hamiltonian parameters .",
    "this approach was discussed in section iii for the diatomic chain example , which satisfies the necessary conditions . in applications to real materials , this ideally simple situation is not expected to be very common , and therefore the approximate wannier basis vector construction is recommended for routine use .",
    "a systematic procedure has been presented for the construction of localized wannier basis vectors and corresponding effective hamiltonians , applicable to arbitrary structures and phonon - related transitions .",
    "the application to several different structures has been described . for the perovskite structure , a new approach to the oxygen - octahedron transition in @xmath2",
    "is suggested , which avoids the subtle difficulties arising from the use of a  rotational variable .",
    "\" improvements can be systematically made by including additional band subspaces in the effective hamiltonian subspace , if indicated by the presence of substantial crossing of eigenmode branches or strong anharmonic coupling to inhomogeneous strain or other modes .",
    "the effective hamiltonian parameters for a particular material can be obtained using any method that can reliably calculate force constants and distortion energies .",
    "once the force - constant matrices have been calculated , the construction of an effective hamiltonian is straightforward and requires very little additional computational effort .",
    "an efficient method , such as dft linear - response , expedites the necessary overdetermination of effective hamiltonian parameters . further applications of this approach could include the construction of realistic quantum mechanical models for the study of quantum paraelectrics and ferroelectrics , @xcite as well as classical dynamical models for the study of ferroelectric phenomena such as switching . in addition , these effective hamiltonians can be used for realistic first - principles studies of thermal expansion and other temperature dependent lattice properties , @xcite as well as for structural transitions . more generally , the construction of a wannier basis may prove advantageous for the treatment of localized perturbations . 0.2 in      we thank r. b. phillips , g. moore , s. ogut , a. j. millis , a. rappe and w. zhong for useful discussions .",
