    "this  ballistic motion \" is not predicted by any theory of the phase transition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] , we see a strong correlation between the transition width @xmath65@xcite and the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "as the transition width decreases , the dynamic exponent tends towards @xmath7.@xcite this is easiest to see in optimally doped films ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the transition temperatures of these films are all between 19 k and 21.6 k , changing by only 12% , but the transition widths vary from 0.2 k to 2.55 k , changing by more than a factor of 10 . thus the variations in @xmath6 are driven by the transition width as opposed to the transition temperature .",
    "moreover , films of different dopings follow a general trend of decreasing dynamic critical exponent as transition width increases ( excluding the two outliers),@xcite though for highly over- and under - doped films , the transition width is much wider .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : criterion2 ] we predicted the size of the critical regime to be on the order of @xmath99 mk and possibly as large as @xmath58 mk .",
    "this means that samples must be homogenous with transition widths smaller than 0.72 k in the best case scenario , and smaller than 0.026 k in the worst case scenario .",
    "wide transition widths imply sample inhomogeneity , thus the critical behavior of one part of the sample will be dominated by the larger signal generated by the mean - field behavior of different part of the sample with a slightly different @xmath57 , especially as the critical regime is so small in pcco .",
    "this indicates that the critical regime will be obscured in films with the broad transition widths .",
    "our data confirm this hypothesis : at the smallest transition widths , we find @xmath100 in optimally - doped and @xmath101 films , similar to results in ybco.@xcite however , as the transition width increases the dynamic critical exponent tends towards @xmath97 .",
    "our results imply that only in more homogenous films , with transition widths smaller than current transition widths will we be able to unambiguously see critical dynamics for all dopings ( though whether all dopings will have the same dynamic critical exponent as optimally - doped pcco and ybco is unknown ) . however , our films are of similar or better quality than most reported in the literature , and recent improvements in pcco film growth@xcite remove impurities but do not decrease the transition widths .",
    "a scaling analysis of these data indicates that @xmath96 for films with broad transition widths , which implies @xmath102 ( not predicted by any theories ) .",
    "however , rather than indicating a new type of phase transition , this indicates the failure of scaling analysis to describe the behavior of these films .",
    "in a conventional superconductor , there is a rapid change from the normal state with ohmic behavior ( @xmath103 ) to the superconducting state , which is highly non - ohmic with @xmath104 , where the power @xmath32 increases as current density decreases ( recall that as @xmath72 approaches the critical current density , @xmath105 ) . looking only at the power @xmath32 , for a conventional superconductor above @xmath57 , we see that @xmath106 and is independent of @xmath72 , below @xmath57 , @xmath107 .",
    "this is precisely the behavior we see in our films with wide transition widths .",
    "we identify the transition temperature as the lowest temperature isotherm whose power @xmath32 ( the slope on the logarithmic derivative plot ) does not vary with @xmath72 .",
    "we then use that slope to calculate @xmath6 , recalling @xmath108 , and if @xmath109 , then @xmath97 .",
    "however , this analysis is flawed : what we are seeing is the rapid change ( usually in less than 0.1 k ) from ohmic behavior ( @xmath109 ) to non - ohmic behavior ( @xmath110 ) . in this way , the phase transition in pcco is similar to the phase transition in conventional superconductors ( rapid switch from ohmic to non - ohmic behavior ) , and indicates mean - field behavior rather than critical behavior .",
    "this in turn indicates that , in regards to the normal - superconducting phase transition , pcco usually behaves like a conventional superconductor .",
    "moreover , conducting a scaling analysis on this kind of system to find @xmath6 is intrinsically flawed  the dynamic exponent @xmath6 we measure is not the critical exponent for any phase transition , but rather an indication that the critical dynamics can not be used for films where the transition width is large compared to the critical regime .",
    "we have also measured the static critical exponent @xmath8 as a function of doping . although we can not use the low - current ohmic tails to measure @xmath8 , as is conventionally done , in small magnetic fields@xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the zero - field transition temperature , @xmath113 is the vortex - glass transition temperature and @xmath8 is the zero - field static critical exponent .",
    "[ eq : nu ] is valid both for critical dynamics , where 3d - xy predicts @xmath114 , and for mean - field theory , which predicts @xmath115.@xcite recent measurements on thin - film ybco using this method found @xmath116.@xcite    a typical measurement is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : nu ] which shows the log - log plot of @xmath117 vs.  @xmath118 for a film of doping @xmath119 .",
    "the slope of this line can be used to find @xmath8 and its error .",
    "the results for all of the films as a function of doping are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu ] .",
    "the dashed line at the top of the figure is @xmath120 , the result predicted from 3d - xy theory .",
    "the lower dashed line is @xmath115 , the result predicted from mean field theory .",
    "for all dopings , we see that @xmath4 , though highly over- and under - doped films deviate from @xmath4 .",
    "this result is consistent with our results from measurements of the dynamic critical exponent , and indicate that the phase transition in pcco is a mean - field transition , independent of doping .",
    "this result is in stark contrast to recent measurements in ybco , which show clear critical behavior , but given the smaller critical region in pcco  reminiscent of the small critical regimes in conventional supercondcutors , it is not surprising that pcco behaves like a conventional superconductor in this regard .",
    "thus both measurements of the dynamics of these films and measurements of the static exponent @xmath8 agree and indicate that we are measuring a mean - field phase transition in pcco .",
    "we have shown that pcco undergoes a second - order phase transition in zero field .",
    "the transition obeys the opposite concavity criterion for current densities greater than @xmath121 a / m@xmath84 , below these current densities , the phase transition is obscured by finite size effects .",
    "we predicted the size of the critical regime in pcco to be @xmath122 mk , which means that the critical dynamics of these films will be obscured by the large transition width in these materials ( @xmath65 varies from 0.2 k to 2.55 k ) .",
    "this in turn implies that the normal - superconducting phase transition in pcco will obey mean - field theory , similar to conventional superconductors , as opposed to critical dynamics and 3d - xy theory , as recently seen in ybco.@xcite our measurements of the static critical exponent confirm this hypothesis , as @xmath4 for pcco films of all dopings .",
    "we also see behavior similar to conventional superconductors in the @xmath73 curves , which show a rapid change from ohmic to non - ohmic behavior .",
    "this behavior , if analyzed using scaling analysis , gives an erroneously low value for @xmath6 , @xmath123 .",
    "however , for optimally - doped films with extremely narrow transition widths , we find that as @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
