    "the strong electronic correlations characteristic of transition metal oxides pose a problem of long - standing interest @xcite and great current importance @xcite . in transition metal oxides",
    "the important low energy electronic states are derived from the transition metal d - orbitals . in a simple ionic picture",
    "the ground state corresponds to a @xmath3 configuration for each transition metal ion , with d - electron number @xmath4 depending on material .",
    "the correlation energy cost involved in changing the d - occupancy is conventionally denoted by @xmath5 , is defined as @xmath6+e[d^{n-1}]-2e[d^n]$ ] and is typically large . in a ground - breaking paper mott @xcite argued that if @xmath5 were large enough relative to the bandwidth then electron repulsion would prohibit conduction , at least at integer valence .",
    "mott s concept was refined in an important way by zaanen , sawatzky and allen @xcite who noted that correlated electron materials of interest typically contain ligands ( for example the @xmath7 atoms in transition metal oxides ) which are close enough in energy to the chemical potential that one must also consider the transfer of an electron from a ligand to a transition metal site .",
    "ref .   defined the charge transfer energy @xmath8-e[d^{n}]-\\varepsilon_p$ ] with @xmath9 the energy needed to create a hole in a ligand orbital and demonstrated that if @xmath5 were large but @xmath10 then the physics would be controlled by @xmath11 with @xmath5 playing a relatively minor role .",
    "implicit in this argument is a neglect of correlations on the oxygen sites ; the justification is that the number of ligands is large enough and the hole density on the ligands small enough that configurations involving doubly occupied ligand sites may be neglected .",
    "the resulting charge transfer insulator paradigm is central to the conventional understanding @xcite of the physics of transition metal oxides .",
    "while density functional band theory ( dft ) is the work - horse of materials science @xcite , it does not capture the physics of the mott / charge - transfer insulator transition : theoretical study of charge transfer insulators and other correlated electron materials requires methods which include additional correlations .",
    "such `` beyond dft '' methodologies require the identification of a set of orbitals whose correlations are to be treated more accurately , an ansatz for the extra interactions operating among these orbitals , a method of solution of the correlation problem and a prescription for embedding the correlated orbitals into the full electronic structure . in the beyond dft studies of transition metal oxide materials published to date ,",
    "the correlated orbitals are taken to be all or a subset of the transition metal d - states , the extra interactions are matrix elements of the coulomb interaction , projected onto the relevant part of the d - manifold and screened by the other degrees of freedom in the solid , and the method of solution is either a hartree approximation , which gives the widely used `` dft+u '' @xcite approach or dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , which gives the `` dft+dmft '' @xcite approach .",
    "the crucial feature of the embedding is the double counting correction @xcite , which removes correlation contributions from the dft single - particle energies .",
    "the double - counting correction plays a particularly significant role in charge transfer insulators because it affects the value of the p - d energy difference which is crucial to the physics .",
    "however , the double counting correction is not well understood theoretically : several different choices are commonly used@xcite but no exact prescription is known .    in this paper",
    "we argue that the double counting problem should be recast as a problem of determining the occupancy , @xmath12 of the correlated orbitals . expressing",
    "the problem in this way reveals a dramatically simplified picture of the metal - insulator transition in which the only important variables are the correlation strength and @xmath12 .",
    "the complicated real - materials effects of ligand dispersion and ligand - transition metal hybridization and the various theoretical issues related to double counting and other embedding aspects are seen to affect the phase boundary and spectra only via their effects on @xmath12 , as long as well localized orbitals are chosen . expressing",
    "the problem in this way also highlights an important but perhaps under - appreciated aspect of the dft+dmft procedure @xcite : the physics predicted by this method is to a large degree controlled by the choice made for the double - counting correction .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ methods ] outlines our theoretical approach , section  [ results ] presents results obtained using beyond dft methods for rare earth nickelates and cuprates , and section  [ discussion ] gives a discussion and conclusion .",
    "in this paper we use the dft+dmft methodology @xcite . in this procedure",
    "we define in each unit cell @xmath13 ( central position @xmath14 ) a set of `` correlated orbitals '' @xmath15 ( we discuss the mechanics of defining the @xmath16 below ) .",
    "then , following the formal procedure outlined in ref .",
    "one constructs a functional @xmath17 $ ] of the charge density @xmath18 and an auxiliary local green function @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 may be formally defined in terms of the standard kohn - sham density functional and the luttinger - ward functional of @xmath19 . extremizing the functional leads to the kohn - sham - dyson equation relating the self energy @xmath21 and green function @xmath22 , which are matrices in the full single - particle hilbert space :    @xmath23",
    "the self energy is obtained as the functional derivative of the luttinger - ward functional with respect to @xmath19 and the equations are closed by a self - consistency equation relating @xmath19 to the components @xmath24 of @xmath22 . for details see for example ref .  .",
    "we construct and solve the kohn - sham hamiltonian using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ( typically via the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite but in selected cases using the wien2k package @xcite ) .    to obtain the self energy we use the single - site dynamical mean approximation @xcite .",
    "this is generally accepted as containing the essence of the mott and charge - transfer metal - insulator transition physics and is widely used in dft+dmft studies .",
    "multi - site ( `` cluster '' ) methods are too computationally expensive to be practical for dft+dmft calculations ( particularly for orbitally degenerate situations where hunds interactions are important ) . in model systems ,",
    "cluster methods have been shown to provide a more refined picture but confirm that the single - site approximation captures the important high energy physics of the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "in particular a reasonable working definition of whether or not a material is `` strongly correlated '' is whether the stoichiometric compound is on the metallic or insulating side of the single - site dmft phase boundary @xcite . and is widely used in dft+dmft studies of real materials .    in the single - site dynamical mean field approximation",
    "we write    @xmath25    with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the frequency - independent double counting correction which plays a crucial role in our subsequent considerations .",
    "the need to include this term may be seen from the argument that the underlying band theory includes some aspects of the many - body physics within a static approximation ; the additional interactions that go into the computation of @xmath21 in effect count these terms twice so a correction is needed . in practical terms",
    ", the importance of the double - counting term is that any many - body computation of @xmath21 will lead to a static hartree - fock contribution to @xmath21 which will substantially shift the single particle levels .",
    "the double counting correction acts to compensate for this shift . how to specify the double counting term @xmath27 is an important open problem in materials theory .",
    "different prescriptions have been proposed @xcite , but no clear consensus has emerged .",
    "we therefore explore a range of double countings .",
    "the self energy matrix components @xmath28 are obtained from the solution of a quantum impurity model which is specified by the additional beyond band theory interactions discussed in more detail below and by a hybridization function @xmath29 obtained the self - consistency condition , which in the single - site approximation relates @xmath30 , the a - b components of the unit - cell local @xmath31 , to the same components of the green function @xmath32 of the quantum impurity model . explicitly",
    "( the inversion is in the orbital ( a - b ) space ) @xmath33^{-1 } \\label{sce}\\ ] ] for orientation we remark that the matrix of d - level energies determined e.g. from the wannier fit to the band structure is equivalently given as the infinite frequency limit of @xmath34 .",
    "we solved the quantum impurity model using the hybridization expansion method @xcite ; some results were cross - checked via the exact diagonalization solver @xcite .",
    "finally we note that to complete the formal solution one must compute the charge density from @xmath35 and ensure that this charge density is used to obtain the kohn - sham hamiltonian .",
    "we discuss issues of full charge self - consistency below .      in this paper",
    "we focus on transition metal oxides . following common practice in the literature ,",
    "we assume that the important beyond band theory correlations involve atomic - like transition metal d - orbitals .",
    "these are not uniquely defined .",
    "the ambiguity has a physical origin : in a solid the overlap of tails of wavefunctions defined around different atoms , along with the need to introduce additional states to describe the interstitial regions means that there is no unique definition of an atomic orbital .",
    "one must seek a practical definition which corresponds reasonably closely to the physical / chemical intuition of an atomic orbital .",
    "in most of our calculations we construct the d - orbitals using the maximally localized wannier function procedure of @xcite with a wide energy window ( typically @xmath36 to @xmath37 ev with the zero of energy chosen as the fermi level ) which spans the entire p - d manifold of states .",
    "use of the wide energy window is essential to obtain reasonably atomic - like d - orbitals . in selected cases we used the projector method  @xcite with a correspondingly wide energy window .    for the interactions among the d - orbitals we assumed @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the number operator for @xmath0 electrons on site @xmath40 and @xmath41 representing the additional ` hunds - rule ' interactions which give the multiplet structure at fixed @xmath12 ( for explicit forms see e.g. ref .  ) . the `` charging energy '' @xmath5 couples to the total on - site charge , which is strongly electrostatically coupled to the surrounding ions so is renormalized significantly by screening . the appropriate values for different materials",
    "are not well determined theoretically although interesting results have appeared @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a range of @xmath5 values spanning the range estimated from experiment .",
    "the configurations coupled by @xmath41 interact with the rest of the solid only via the electric quadrupole field for which screening is negligble , so these terms are well approximated by their gas - phase values , in agreement with calculation @xcite .      in the literature",
    "@xcite the late transition metal oxides are often described by a phenomenological p - d model , tight - binding formulation in which the hamiltonian includes correlated ( `` d '' ) orbitals with appropriate on - site interactions , ligand ( oxygen ) orbitals ( assumed uncorrelated because the hole density is small ) and the relevant hybridizations .",
    "it may be written as @xmath42 the maximally localized wannier representation of the band structure in the energy window @xmath36 to @xmath43 can be thought of as a derivation , from a first - principles band structure , of the hybridization parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 describing the embedding of the correlated orbitals into the broader electronic structure .",
    "the actual band structure gives a relatively involved form for these terms ( see , e.g. @xcite for cuprates ) whereas many literature papers have considered simpler models where for example oxygen - oxygen hopping is neglected or treated in a simplified manner .",
    "however , the important qualitative and quantitative aspects of the many - body physics have been shown to be insensitive to the details of @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite , at least within the single - site dmft approximation .",
    "the reason , in essence , is that the band structure enters the many - body physics only via the hybridization function @xmath34 ( eq .  [ sce ] ) , in which most of the details are averaged over .    as shown first by zaanen et .",
    "al , the crucial parameter is the difference @xmath46 between an average ligand on - site energy @xmath47 and the orbitally averaged @xmath0 level energy @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath11 is small or negative the d - level lies inside the p - band and the hybridization ensures that model is metallic even at large @xmath5 , whereas if @xmath11 is large and positive the d - bands are well separated from the p - bands and an insulating state may occur if @xmath5 is large enough .",
    "while the qualitative dependence of the physics on @xmath11 is clear , four ambiguities arise in practice .",
    "first , if oxygen - oxygen hopping is important ( as is the case in known transition metal oxides ) the p - states are spread over a wide energy range even before hybridization to the d is considered , but only some portion of these states are hybridized to the d - levels . thus the ` average ligand on - site energy ' referred to above is not clearly defined in realistic cases .",
    "second , the double counting correction enters @xmath49 as a shift of the d - level and therefore enters @xmath11 directly .",
    "thus the value of the double counting correction directly affects the physics and indeed uncertainties in this parameter are a significant source of uncertainty in the theoretical results .",
    "third , the many - body interactions @xmath50 will shift the physical d - level ( as can be easily seen on the hartree level ) ; thus the physical value of @xmath11 also depends on @xmath5 . finally , the self - consistent nature of the dft+dmft procedure means that the band parameters ( in particular the @xmath51 ) are themselves affected by the solution to the many - body problem .",
    "one important goal of the present paper is to show that these ambiguities to a large extent disappear if the theory is parametrized not by @xmath11 but by the d - occupany @xmath12 .      in the rest of this paper an important role is played by the d - occupancy @xmath12 .",
    "this is a theoretically constructed quantity , defined in terms of a representation @xmath52 ( here we define the origin of coordinates to be centered on a transition metal ion and consider only one unit cell ) obtained by one of the methods described above .",
    "the definition is @xmath53 \\nonumber \\label{nddef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in using eq .",
    "[ nddef ] it is important to work with properly normalized @xmath0 -orbitals @xmath54 .",
    "the maximially localized wannier method automatically provides these , but when using projector methods one must typically normalize the resulting d - orbitals .    in the tight - binding p - d model of eq .",
    "[ hpd ] eq .  [ nddef ] becomes @xmath55 where the wave functions are implicitly included via their effect on the hybridization parameters .",
    "we shall see in the analysis to follow that for interactions @xmath5 in the physically reasonable range for late transition metal oxides , and for well localized @xmath54 , all of the details of ligand band structure , of choice of double counting , of full charge self consistency and of dft+dmft vs p - d model and of the precise definition ( wannier vs projector ) of the @xmath54 important only insofar as they affect @xmath12 .",
    "models with the same @xmath12 give , to a very good approximation , the same metal - insulator physics .",
    "at this point one remark is important .",
    "the d - orbital is @xmath56-fold degenerate . in many cases of physical interest only a few of the orbitals",
    "are relevant ( for example , the @xmath57 orbital in high-@xmath2 cuprates ) ; ligand field effects mean that others are fully filled or empty . the @xmath0-occupancy which is important",
    "is that of the relevant partially filled orbitals .",
    "the other `` filled '' orbitals are of course hybridized to the ligands and in any band theory will have occupancies which deviate slightly from integer values .",
    "the precise occupancies of these orbitals are not important , but the presence or absence of these orbitals in the definition of @xmath12 may shift phase boundaries .    as noted above , @xmath12 is a theoretical quantity whose definition involves a choice of an orbital .",
    "the quasi - universal dependence of physics on @xmath12 which we will demonstrate below however suggests that it is interesting to attempt to relate the calculated @xmath12 to experiment and to other calculations .",
    "such a relation is of necessity not precise , but may be informative .",
    "density functional band theory ( without any additional correlations ) provides an estimate of @xmath12 via one of the constructions outlined above . in principle , if the exact density functional were known , dft would produce the exact charge density @xmath58 , and existing approximate implementations are believed @xcite to provide very accurate representations of @xmath18 .",
    "this does not guarantee that the dft estimate of @xmath12 ( which as seen from eq .",
    "[ nddef ] depends on @xmath31 at two different spatial points ) is exact even given the exact density functional , but the small spatial extent of the d - orbitals and the general success of dft describing basic charge properties suggests that it is reasonable to expect that the physical @xmath12 are not too far from the dft estimates .",
    "experimental estimation of the @xmath0 valence is possible via analysis of transferred hyperfine couplings @xcite or magnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "these experiments have indicated very strong covalency effects in cuprates .",
    "resonant x - ray scattering @xcite can detect the density of holes on oxygen .",
    "further , spectroscopic measurements can in some cases identify the @xmath59 energies , permitting more quantitative comparison to theory .",
    "these issues will be discussed further below .",
    "our specific calculations are performed for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we consider only the idealized crystal structures ; simple cubic @xmath62 perovskite for @xmath61 ( lattice constant @xmath63 ; simple tetragonal ( t ) structure for @xmath60 ( lattice constants @xmath64 in plane and @xmath65 c - direction with the z position of apical oxygens @xmath66 % of the c - axis lattice parameter .",

    "we found no significant difference in the results of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "for @xmath61 we chose two correlated orbitals per ni site , representing the @xmath67 and @xmath68 states . recently deng and collaborators used a full five orbital model ( also retaining only the density - density terms ) to study the nickelates @xcite ; their results ( apart from some details of excitation from the @xmath69 bands ) are again essentially the same as those obtained from the two - correlated orbital model .    to define the correlated orbitals and determine the hybridization function we typically used gga calculations with vasp to define the band structure and maximally localized wannier functions defined over an energy range of -9@xmath703ev for @xmath60 and -8@xmath704ev for @xmath61 to fix the bare hybridization function and the choice of @xmath0-orbital .",

    "however , the d@xmath102 orbital gap is rather smaller compared to the vasp / wannier results .",
    "this is the only difference we have found between results computed at the same @xmath12 and is presumably due to the different definitions of correlation strength following from the different definitions of correlated orbitals .    .",

    "[ dos_selfc ] of the spectral functions obtained from different cuprate calculations .",
    "the lower panel shows the spectral functions obtained using the fully charge self - consistent procedure described above with the standard double counting formula , while the upper panel shows the spectral functions obtained from a dft+dmft calculation based on the wein2k / projector band theory with @xmath11 adjusted so the final @xmath12 matches the fully self - consistent one . as the d@xmath102 orbital gets renormalized in the self - consistent dft+dmft charge density , the d orbital energy levels except d@xmath102 move slightly away from the fermi energy by very small amounts of order @xmath123 .",
    "but the basic similarity of the two calculations shows again that @xmath12 is the crucial variable and also indicates that the renormalization of the band theory by the fully charge self - consistent procedure is small .",
    "the generally accepted zaanen - sawatzky - allen theory of late transition metal oxides describes the metal - insulator - transition physics of transition metal oxides in terms of two parameters : @xmath5 , a charging energy associated with the transition metal d - orbitals , and @xmath34 , an energy difference between transition metal d and oxygen p levels .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is difficult to define precisely for two reasons .",
    "first , the oxygen states in typical transition metal oxides are spread out into a band , so it is not clear what energy to use for @xmath47 .",
    "second , the physical d - level energy has a substantial contribution from the many - body interactions of interest , both directly and via the charge transfer energy @xmath124 . in physical terms",
    "@xmath34 parametrizes the degree of covalence between the ligand and transition metal orbitals .",
    "the results presented in this paper indicate that it is very useful to parametrize this covalence instead by the @xmath0-occupancy @xmath12 , which is a single - valued function of @xmath34 .",
    "we show that the zaanen - sawatzky - allen metal - insulator phase diagram takes a very simple , quasi - universal form when expressed in the @xmath110 plane , and that the main features of the calculated many - body spectra depend mainly on @xmath12 : different combinations of @xmath5 , band parameters and @xmath124 give very similar spectra if they yield the same @xmath12 .",
    "expressing the phase diagram in the @xmath110 plane reveals an interesting and apparently previously unnoticed phenomenon : the mott - zaanen - sawatzky - allen insulating state is only obtained if @xmath12 is relatively close to an integer value ( low covalence ) and at larger @xmath5 the phase boundary is nearly vertical .",
    "thus within the zaanen - sawatzky - allen picture local correlations can not drive a metal insulator transition unless the physical covalence is quite small .",
    "@xmath12 is a theoretical quantity , precisely defined only within a specific calculational scheme .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath12 depend on the method which is used , so the @xmath110 phase diagram is in principle specific to a given calculational method . in most of the results presented in this paper",
    "we have defined the correlated orbitals using a maximally localized wannier function construction @xcite with an energy window taken large enough to include all of the @xmath125 complex of bands .",
    "the resulting @xmath126 wannier functions are highly localized .",
    "we have also investigated other prescriptions , for example the projector methods used in the vasp dft+u and the projector - based dft+dmft methods  @xcite .",
    "we find that if an adequate energy window is used , all of the procedures employed in current literature give very similar answers ( for examples , see figs .",
    "[ pdnd],[cupratepd ] ) .",
    "although @xmath12 is a model - dependent quantity , it is interesting to compare the values of @xmath12 obtained by different methods and to use the results to place materials on the metal - insulator phase diagram .",
    "density functional band theory methods ( in combination with a definition of d orbital ) yield predictions for @xmath12 which are indicated in figs .",

    "the theoretical status of these results requires some discussion .",
    "if the exact density functional were known and the kohn - sham equations could be solved exactly , the exact density @xmath128 would be obtained @xcite .",

    "[ nddef ] . this can not be derived directly from any projection of @xmath18 and as a matter of principal need not be given exactly even by exact density functional theory .",
    "however , the small size of the atomic orbitals along with the general success of dft methods in obtaining charge densities and basic band structures @xcite suggests that the dft estimates for @xmath12 may be reasonable .",
    "it is important to point out that there is at present no solid - state benchmark for the quantitative reliability of the results of present state of the art functionals and some experimental results indicate that density functional methods overestimate covalency @xcite .",
    "thus it might be that density functional results for @xmath12 are substantially in error in correlated materials .",
    "a systematic evaluation of the reliability of dft estimates of transition metal - ligand covalency is also indicated .",
    "an important question for beyond dft calculations is the extent to which many body effects ( including the double counting correction ) change @xmath12 from the band theory value . in many cases the standard fully charge self - consistent implementations of dft+u and dft+dmft",
    "change @xmath12 only slightly from the band theory value .",
    "for example , our recent studies of @xmath131 @xcite reveal a gga values of @xmath132 for the two inequivalent @xmath133 sites , whereas gga+u with @xmath134 and @xmath135 gives @xmath136 .",
    "an example for cuprates is shown in fig .",
    "[ cupratepd ] .",
    "however , other calculations use a double counting procedure which gives a larger change .",
    "for example ref .   modeled @xmath60 using a double counting correction which shifted @xmath12 from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "determination of the most correct double counting correction is an important open problem in materials theory ; the results of this paper suggest that the issue may usefully be addressed by consideration of the interaction - induced shifts in @xmath12 .",
    "experimental estimation of the @xmath0 valence is also of interest .",
    "indirect measurements , for example of the transferred hyperfine couplings @xcite or the magnetic form factor in ordered states @xcite have indicated very strong covalency effects in cuprates .",
    "the estimates given in these papers are @xmath139 , somewhat larger than the band theory values using well localized orbitals",
    ". a more direct approach would be to detect the density of holes on oxygen via resonant x - ray scattering techniques as in refs .  .",
    "as indicated in fig .",
    "[ dos ] , spectroscopic measurements of the relative position of @xmath96 and @xmath0 features in the many - body density of states would also be revealing .",
    "one particularly informative experiment would be a measurement of changes in the density across the @xmath119 series , to reveal the change in @xmath7-hole density .",
    "finally , we discuss some consequences of our results .",
    "we first observe that if one chooses a double - counting which fixes @xmath12 at the dft value , then both @xmath60 and @xmath61 would , within single - site dmft , be predicted to be metals .",
    "the nickelate estimate @xmath140 is so far from the value @xmath141 needed to drive a mott / charge - transfer metal insulator transition that it seems likely that standard mott / charge transfer physics is simply not relevant to the rare earth nickelate family of materials .",
    "@xmath61 is a moderately correlated metal in experiment @xcite , but replacing @xmath142 by other rare earths drives a metal - insulator transition @xcite sometimes interpreted in the mott / charge transfer paradigm @xcite .",
    "we have verified that within gga band theory ( and using the wannier prescription defined in this paper ) the d - occupancy is nearly the same for strongly insulating @xmath131 in the experimental structure as it is for @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , the insulating members of the rare - earth nickelate series are characterized by a large amplitude lattice distortion @xcite which plays a key role in the insulating behavior @xcite .",
    "band structure calculations place high-@xmath2 cuprates rather closer to the metal - insulator transition than are the rare - earth nickelates , but still on the metallic side of the phase boundary .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable that the correct double - counting correction will move the materials across the phase boundary into the insulating state ( as assumed e.g. in ref .",
    "alternatively , physics beyond the simple mott / charge - transfer picture may drive the insulating state .",
    "for example , cluster dynamical mean field and other calculations in the hubbard model at moderate interaction strengths reveal a crucial effect of intermediate - ranged antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite .",
    "more broadly our findings raise an important issue in current materials theory . in a beyond - dft calculation one",
    "chooses a subset of orbitals which are subject to additional correlations .",
    "the point of view expounded by zaanen , sawatzky and allen @xcite , implemented in most dft+u and dft+dmft codes @xcite and used here is that for transition metals the correlated orbitals are atomic - like transition metal d orbitals ; and that the remaining states ( in particular the @xmath7-p orbitals ) , are included in the calculation but with correlations treated only on the dft level .",
    "we refer to this approach , somewhat imprecisely , as the `` p - d model '' approach .",
    "an alternative , also widely adopted in the literature , is that one should define the correlated orbitals by downfolding the band structure to include only the frontier orbitals ( in the transition metal oxide context , the p - d antibonding bands which cross the fermi level ) , which are then treated as a multiorbital hubbard model .",
    "the two approaches can lead to different physics .",
    "for example , if the total number of electrons per unit cell is an odd integer , increasing u in the multiorbital hubbard model always leads to a metal - insulator transition , whereas in the p - d model increasing @xmath5 may or may not lead to a metal - insulator transition , depending on the covalency .",
    "different results are also found for orbital polarization in ni - based oxide superlattices @xcite .",
    "which approach provides the most reasonable modelling of actual materials is not completely clear , although the fact that as presently implemented the dft+dmft approximation captures only local correlations suggests that one should favor approaches based on well localized orbitals @xcite .",
    "further investigations are warranted into the questions of which orbitals to correlate and of how to downfold the fully interacting model to an effective low energy model which can be studied numerically .",
