    "spectroscopy is a powerful tool for distilling the key degrees of freedom in a given system . at the present time , the best way of extracting the spectrum of states from the qcd lagrangian is monte carlo computer calculations using a space - time lattice .",
    "a spectrum determination requires the extraction of many excited - state energies , so a brief discussion on how excited - state energies can be determined from monte carlo estimates of correlation functions in euclidean field theory is warranted . in this talk ,",
    "several past explorations of the qcd spectrum are outlined , in particular , glueball masses in the pure - gauge theory and the energies of gluonic excitations of the so - called static quark - antiquark potential .",
    "also , ongoing efforts by the lattice hadron physis collaboration ( lhpc ) to determine the baryon spectrum using extended three - quark operators are described .",
    "the monte carlo method can be applied to obtain estimates of the path integrals which yield a hermitian matrix of correlation functions @xmath0 , where @xmath1 creates the states of interest at time @xmath2 and @xmath3 annihilates such states at a later time @xmath4 .",
    "the procedure for extracting the lowest energies @xmath5 from this matrix is well known@xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some fixed reference time ( typically small ) and the eigenvalues , also known as the _ principal _ correlation functions , are ordered such that @xmath9 as @xmath4 becomes large .",
    "then one can show that @xmath10 determinations of the principal correlators @xmath6 for large temporal separations @xmath4 yield the desired energies @xmath11 . since statistical fluctuations grow with increasing @xmath4 , it is crucial that contributions from higher - lying states be diminished so that the desired lowest - lying energies dominate the principal correlators well before the signal - to - noise ratio falls .",
    "judiciously chosen quark - field and gluon - field smearings is one important ingredient for reducing couplings to the short wavelength modes of the theory .",
    "the use of large sets of extended operators is another key ingredient .",
    "our monte carlo calculations are carried out in a finite - sized box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "given the finite volume and the discrete nature of the allowed momenta in the box , the masses and widths of resonances ( unstable hadrons ) can not be calculated directly , but must be deduced from the discrete spectrum of finite - volume stationary states for a range of box sizes@xcite .",
    "such applications require prohibitive computational resources , but our goal in the baryon project is to obtain a first exploratory scan of the spectrum , so simply obtaining the finite - volume spectrum for a few judiciously - chosen volumes should suffice for ferreting out the hadron resonances from the less interesting scattering states .",
    "glueball masses in the pure - gauge theory , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , were the first exploration of the qcd spectrum@xcite in which i was involved .",
    "the spectrum can be fairly well described by a bag model description of the gluons , whereas string models seem to fare less well .",
    "inclusion of light - quark effects is an ongoing challenge .",
    "the issue of string formation of the gauge - field in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair was my next exploration@xcite .",
    "for quark - antiquark separations @xmath13 greater than 2 fm , the spectrum of gluonic excitations agreed without exception with that expected from an effective string theory description of the gauge field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) , and a fine structure provided tantalizing clues to the nature of such an effective string theory . a dramatic level reordering was observed as @xmath13 became smaller , suggesting a bag model picture or multipole expansion may be more relevant at such scales .",
    "these energies were used@xcite as a starting point in a born - oppenheimer treatment of heavy - quark mesons , both conventional and hybrid ( bound by an excited gluon field ) .",
    "agreement of level splittings from direct monte carlo calculations with those in the leading born - oppenheimer approximation validated such a treatment and provided a compelling physical picture of both conventional and hybrid heavy - quark mesons .",
    "i am currently a member of the lattice hadron physics collaboration ( lhpc )",
    ". one of our goals is to compute the spectrum of baryon resonances , with an eye towards later determining the meson spectrum .",
    "we have designed large sets of extended , gauge - invariant three - quark operators to facilitate this task@xcite . the usual operator construction which mimics",
    "the approach one would take in continuous space - time is very cumbersome , especially when tackling an entire spectrum .",
    "our approach combines the physical characteristics of baryons with the symmetries of the lattice regularization of qcd used in simulations . for baryons at rest ,",
    "our operators are formed using group - theoretical projections onto the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the @xmath14 symmetry group of a three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "there are four two - dimensional irreps @xmath15 , @xmath16 and two four - dimensional representations @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the continuum - limit spins @xmath19 of our states can be deduced by examining degeneracy patterns across the different @xmath14 irreps .",
    "baryons are expected to be rather large objects , and hence , local operators will not suffice . our approach to constructing extended operators is to use covariant displacements of the quark fields .",
    "displacements in different directions are used to build up the appropriate orbital structure , and displacements of different lengths can build up the needed radial structure .",
    "there are six different spatial orientations that we use , shown in fig  [ fig : two ] .",
    "the singly - displaced operators are meant to mock up a diquark - quark coupling , and the doubly - displaced and triply - displaced operators are chosen since they favor the @xmath20-flux and @xmath21-flux configurations , respectively .",
    "we have now finished optimizing the quark - field and gauge - field smearing parameters , and have begun low - statistics runs to prune out the ineffectual and overly - noisy operators .",
    "some sample effective mass plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "our goal is to find the smallest set of operators out of the several hundred we have constructed which are useful for extracting some number of lowest - lying states , and to push the technology to maximize the number of excited - state energies which can be reliably determined .",
    "we shall report our findings in the near future .",
