    "experiments with ultracold atoms and molecules probe collisional physics at very low temperatures . gases of quantum degenerate fermionic atoms are being studied  @xcite , and experiments are progressing towards the creation of degenerate gases of fermionic molecules  @xcite . at very low temperatures , quantum statistics plays an important role in interparticle collisions .",
    "one way to observe an effect which depends on the symmetry of the particles is to look at low - energy collisions which obey quantum threshold laws ; this was measured in elastic collisions in fermionic atomic gases @xcite and in reactive collisions of ultracold molecules @xcite .",
    "another effect of quantum statistics is pauli blocking of collisions , as was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite : collisions are suppressed if the final state can not enter a filled fermi sphere .",
    "in contrast to the quantum threshold behavior , the observation of this effect requires the fermions to be quantum degenerate .    in the present work",
    "we investigate how averaged collisional rates depend on the temperature , density , and masses in a two - species fermi gas . the usual experimental observable in a cloud of ultracold gas is a collision rate which is averaged over the distribution of velocities in the gas .",
    "usually this ensemble - averaging of collision rates is done using a boltzmann distribution , however as experiments move deeper into the quantum degenerate regime , quantum statistics starts playing a role .",
    "particular attention here will be focused on the imbalanced fermi gas , i.e.  a two - component gas where the two species have different densities or masses .",
    "the effect of mass or density imbalance on the averaged collision rates at low temperatures is most pronounced in this setting , the rates can differ significantly from a boltzmann - averaged rate .",
    "averaged collision rates for a two - component gas of fermions are studied , for general two - body collisions with an arbitrary cross - section .",
    "the particles are assumed to be in equilibrium ; effects of pauli - blocking are not considered .",
    "the two types of fermions may have different masses , different densities , and different temperatures .",
    "first , it is shown that an averaged collision rate is expressed as an average over the distribution of relative energies ( sec .",

    "this distribution is calculated for fermions analytically at @xmath0 , and it is shown that this function has a simple geometric interpretation ( sec .",

    "the relative energy distribution is calculated numerically and a simple approximation for all temperatures is proposed ( sec .",

    "some details of the calculations are presented in the appendices . in sec .",
    "[ sec-2d ] , we discuss how the results can be transferred to a situation where the particles are confined to a two - dimensional geometry .",
    "experiments with clouds of ultracold gases measure collision rates , e.g.  using photoassociation spectra  @xcite or trap loss rates due to chemical reactions  @xcite . here one actually measures rates which are averaged over the distribution of velocities in the gas .",
    "this ensemble - averaging is the topic of this section .",

    "the rate equation  ( [ rateeq ] ) refers only to the process  ( [ proc ] ) .",
