    "a reliable calibration of the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation is of crucial importance for the continued use of classical cepheids as distance indicators for nearby spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "the well known key project of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) to measure the hubble constant _",
    "h@xmath2 _ to within @xmath3 has been marvellously successful @xcite , with remaining sources of uncertainty generally consisting of : ( i ) the importance of metallicity differences between cepheids , and ( ii ) the zero - point established for large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheids .",
    "alternate zero - point calibrations for the pl relation are possible for galactic cepheids by various techniques , including trigonometric parallaxes , cluster parallaxes , and use of the baade - wesselink method .",
    "the last two techniques generally confirm the existing pl calibration @xcite , while the use of parallax data to test the calibration has traditionally been limited by the small size of trigonometric parallaxes for cepheids relative to their uncertainties , the situation applying to most _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the technique has been revived recently by @xcite for 10 galactic cepheids using the _ hst _ fine guidance sensor 3 and grids of surrounding faint stars .",
    "a revision of the _ hipparcos _ results has also been made by @xcite for a slightly larger sample , with comparable precision in some cases .",
    "an interesting feature of the _ hst _ calibration of the pl relation is that the slope appears to depend upon a single long - period cepheid in the sample , namely @xmath4 car .",
    "although that does not appear to affect the zero - point of the relationship @xcite , it is a characteristic that has a ready explanation in terms of the star s location in the cepheid instability strip , which includes stars of different effective temperatures and surface gravities .",
    "stars of similar pulsation period may have quite different parameters , with more massive stars lying towards the hot side of the strip and less massive stars towards the cool side of the strip .",
    "a cepheid s exact location in the strip can often be established to a first approximation from an individual cepheid s light amplitude and intrinsic color , yet there is another diagnostic tool that can be applied using the cepheid s rate of period change , which is tied closely to mass , the factor dominating the rate at which stars evolve through the instability strip @xcite . all galactic cepheid calibrators with trigonometric parallaxes exhibit well - defined period changes that allow their locations within the instability strip to be specified very accurately .",
    "the present paper explores the effect of instability strip location on recent calibrations of the cepheid pl relation , and presents an alternative version that considers all potential complicating factors .",
    "the use of cepheids as distance indicators suffers from problems arising from the fact that a cepheid s luminosity is tied to its location within the instability strip , while its observed brightness is affected by interstellar and/or intergalactic extinction .",
    "the situation has been described repeatedly in the literature , and can be summarized through the standard formulation involving the period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relation in terms of _ b  v _ color : @xmath5 where _ a _ is the slope of the relationship ( the period dependence ) , _ b _ is the color term , _ c _ is the zero - point , and angled brackets denote intensity means .",
    "reddening affects the observed colors of cepheids , with intrinsic color being given by : @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is the color excess .",
    "the extinction at visual wavelengths is specified by the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , @xmath8/e@xmath9 , therefore : @xmath10 combining the relationships @xcite produces an equation for the distance _",
    "r _ to any cepheid given by : @xmath11    the color term _ b _ for the plc relation is typically close to the value of _ r _ applicable to interstellar extinction , although the exact value is a matter of debate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the similarity of the two terms makes it possible to adopt a color correction similar to the value of _ r _ to correct for the effects of either color spread within the instability strip or reddening , but not necessarily both ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unless @xmath12 .",
    "reddening - free _ q _ parameters have been in use for many years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although their validity can be questioned given the sizeable range of parameters characterizing interstellar reddening and extinction within our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to remove the effects of reddening and instability strip color spread from cepheids is attributed to @xcite , who adopted the then - current plc color term of 2.67 to correct cepheid magnitudes primarily for dispersion within the strip as well as for most of the effects of interstellar extinction .",
    "the alternative wesenheit function of @xcite used a color term of 3.1 to correct primarily for the effects of interstellar extinction , presumably overcorrecting slightly for color spread within the strip .",
    "it was recognized that alternative functional dependences would be required for galaxies where different extinction laws applied @xcite , and more recent formulations have in fact used a color term of 3.3 , a value that is appropriate for nearby galactic stars with similar colors to cepheids @xcite .",

    "recent calibrations typically include such a parameter based upon the wesenheit formulation with magnitudes from the near - infrared spectral region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "use of near - infrared magnitudes has the beneficial effect of reducing , or possibly eliminating , effects that might be linked to reddening law variations or to metallicity differences between cepheids , which affect colors ( mainly in the optical region ) corresponding to specific effective temperatures as well as the degree of penetration into the strip for post - hydrogen - burning stars .",
    "but the question remains as to whether or not differences in the properties of interstellar dust from one galaxy to another are important enough to affect the calibration used to establish cepheid distances .",
    "given the importance to the pl calibration of reddening and the location of individual cepheids within the instability strip , it is of interest to consider the other methods of calibration available .",
    "the reddening of the cepheids studied by @xcite was established from the colors and spectral types of stars lying along the same lines of sight , i.e. from their space reddenings . in many cases",
    "the stars also have independent estimates for their reddenings from spectroscopic methods @xcite or their equivalents @xcite , and some from independently - derived space reddenings @xcite , so it is informative to compare the results .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] compares available estimates for the reddening of _ hst _ cepheids , as obtained from space reddenings @xcite , spectroscopic methods @xcite , and compilations standardized to space reddenings @xcite .",
    "photometric reddenings were omitted from such a comparison because they do not always account for the natural dispersion within the instability strip of cepheids at constant period ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an attempt was made to deduce independent field reddenings for the cepheids using 2mass data @xcite , as illustrated by @xcite , but relatively large uncertainties in the infrared data , in combination with the small reddenings and distances to the stars , produced results with very large uncertainties , much larger than values typically no larger than @xmath24 that apply to the color excesses cited in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the differences between the independent reddening estimates in table  [ tab1 ] is no larger than the associated uncertainties in the values , so a simple unweighted average was formed for the mean reddening of each cepheid .",
    "those values are listed in column 8 of table  [ tab1 ] , and the inferred intrinsic colors are plotted as a function of logarithm of pulsation period in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . also plotted are intrinsic colors for cepheids of known reddening , based upon an unpublished compilation of photometric and spectroscopic reddenings tied to a space reddening scale @xcite , and intrinsic colors for cepheids in the same sample that have the largest amplitudes for their pulsation period .",
    "the latter should concentrate towards the center of the instability strip or slightly blueward , where cepheids of largest light amplitude are located .",
    "the scatter should closely represent the actual scatter caused by the natural dispersion of cepheids within the instability strip , thus the points corresponding to the _ hst _ cepheids provide direct information about where they lie in the instability strip .",
    "an inspection of the data leads to the unexpected result that the three cepheids of longest period in the _ hst _ sample are redder ( cooler ) than cepheids lying near the center of the instability strip , while the bluest ( hottest ) cepheids in the group are all at the short period end .",
    "the three longest period cepheids in the _ hst _ sample are therefore less luminous than cepheids lying near strip center , so any attempt to construct a period - absolute magnitude relation based solely on the sample would pathologically underestimate the true slope of the relationship .",
    "just such an effect was noted in the @xcite study , without the natural explanation evident from the intrinsic colors of the cepheids .",
    "the resulting study of the cepheid pl relation from _ hst _ parallaxes therefore contains a potential source of bias .",
    "the bias in this case is a curious variant of the expected malmquist bias in that the less - luminous short - period cepheids in the sample are drawn from the most luminous objects of the class while the more - luminous long - period cepheids are drawn from the least luminous objects of the class .",
    "a combination of intrinsic color , light amplitude , and rate of period change can be used to identify the location of each cepheid calibrator in the instability strip uniquely , as noted by @xcite .",
    "in essence , a measure of period change for a cepheid relates directly to the rate at which the progenitor star is evolving through the instability strip . for a specific pulsation period ,",
    "that rate correlates closely with the mass of the star : more massive stars evolving faster than less massive stars . the correlation is essentially exact for the rapid first crossing of the instability strip @xcite , but contains more scatter for higher order crossings owing to complications attributable mainly to the degree of envelope contamination of the star by cno elements @xcite that are introduced by meridional mixing occurring during previous main - sequence stages @xcite .",
    "the degree to which individual cepheids penetrate the instability strip following the onset of helium burning and shell helium burning in their interiors is affected by such chemical composition differences , making it difficult , but not impossible , to relate rate of period change to the specific location of individual cepheids within the instability strip .",
    "light travel time effects in binary systems and stochastic variations in pulsation period are an added complication that affect observed rates of period change in cepheids , but tend to be only a minor annoyance for the majority of objects .",
    "the technique works well for the case of the cluster cepheid v1726 cyg @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for individual _ hst _ cepheids are described below , with reference to the data of table  [ tab1 ] as plotted in fig .",
    "the actual blue light amplitudes and rates of period change for each cepheid have been normalized to the values appropriate for a cepheid with a pulsation period of 10 days ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to facilitate comparison with the results found for a larger sample of cepheids .",
    "normalization in such fashion helps to generalize the individual results for a more realistic comparison with the overall results applying to a larger sample of galactic cepheids .",
    "rt aur has a large light amplitude consistent with a location near the center of the instability strip , but with a rate of period increase slightly larger than that of cepheids of comparable amplitude in the third strip crossing .",
    "its parameters are inconsistent with a fifth crossing of the instability strip , since it would then lie redward of strip center whereas its derived intrinsic color matches those for large - amplitude cepheids , all of which lie slightly blueward of strip center .",
    "the best overall match of its parameters is to cepheids lying slightly blueward of strip center in the third crossing of the strip .",
    "the exact rate of period change for rt aur is still poorly established because the cepheid appears to be affected by light travel time effects from its long - term orbital motion about a companion .",
    "the rate of period change has only recently been established with confidence @xcite .",
    "t vul has an intermediate light amplitude consistent with a location either redward or blueward of strip center , and its rate of period decrease matches cepheids that are either blueward of strip center in the second crossing or redward of strip center in the fourth crossing .",

    "w sgr has a large light amplitude and a rate of period increase consistent with cepheids lying near strip center in the third crossing .",

    "the cepheid s red color relative to stars lying near strip center is consistent with the latter .",
    "perhaps that attribute has some link to the cepheid s somewhat unusual light curve relative to other 10-day cepheids .",
    "@xmath4 car has a relatively small light amplitude and a rapid rate of period increase , which would normally suggest a cepheid in the third crossing of the instability strip lying near the blue edge .",
    "the star s colors , however , indicate a cepheid lying well towards the red edge of the strip .",
    "the alternate possibility is that @xmath4 car is in the fifth crossing of the strip lying redward of strip center , which appears to be the only possibility consistent with its observed characteristics . given its inferred direction of evolution and implied location in the instability strip , @xmath4 car might be expected to undergo a detectable amplitude decrease in coming years .",

    "[ fig7 ] emphasizes the good agreement between cluster and _ hst _ parallaxes with predictions from empirical relations .",

    "16 of 24 , or @xmath144 , agree with empirical predictions within the stated uncertainties , with all of the outliers lying within @xmath145 of the predicted values except for x cyg .",
    "the observed percentages of calibrators lying within @xmath146 of the predicted values are consistent with statistical expectations for both _",
    "hst _ and cluster cepheids .",
    "an identical analysis was attempted for the revised _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes of cepheids tabulated by @xcite , but with mixed results .",
    "an initial sample included only objects in table  2 of @xcite , and generated similar results to that obtained for _ hst _ cepheids , namely @xmath147 , but with larger scatter and the implicit assumption that su cas , dt cyg , bg cru , and @xmath84 umi must be identified as overtone pulsators to be consistent with their observed parallaxes .",
    "while the @xcite sample represents the most suitable selection of _ hipparcos _ cepheids for calibration purposes , the question of proper identification of pulsation mode in individual variables makes comparison with the present calibration of uncertain value .",
    "the identification of pulsation mode in specific cepheids frequently involves fourier parameters for their light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as in the case of su cas , which is argued to be an overtone pulsator partly on that basis @xcite .",
    "the fourier parameters for su cas are ambiguous regarding its pulsation mode , however , and fundamental mode pulsation is argued by its potential membership in cas r2 @xcite .",
    "fourier parameters may also not be applicable to sinusoidal cepheids , the traditional s - cepheids , which frequently display light curves so closely matching sine waves that their resulting fourier series do not have significant second and third order terms necessary for generating traditional fourier parameters .",
    "in many such cases the mode of pulsation is not obvious , with fundamental mode and overtone pulsation both being typical of individual variables ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a good example is the s - cepheid ff aql in table  [ tab1 ] , a cepheid that is a fundamental mode cepheid according to its _ hst _ parallax yet an overtone pulsator according to its _ hipparcos _ parallax .",
    "the higher precision of the _ hst _ parallax would appear to argue the case for the former .",
    "it is possible to test how well the table  2 sample of @xcite represents the complete set of cepheids in the _ hipparcos _ data base .",
    "there are 207 such cepheids with reddenings available from the sources cited above , and all of them were analyzed as above in order to obtain empirical estimates of parallax for comparison purposes .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , including alternate solutions for four cepheids suspected to be overtone pulsators . as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the relationship represents expectations for exact coincidence of the estimates .        what is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] is that natural scatter in the parallaxes is larger for the _ hipparcos _ cepheid sample than is the case for _ hst _ and cluster cepheids . in part",
    "that can be attributed to overly - large uncertainties in the parallaxes for faint cepheids near the observational limits of the _ hipparcos _ program , as is the case for many of the objects of small parallax in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . but",
    "large scatter appears to persist over all parallaxes , even in the case of cepheids of small @xmath148 , and is not always resolved by the assumption of overtone pulsation in individual objects .",
    "the precision cited for the revised parallaxes of cepheids in the _ hipparcos _ collection does not always appear to be representative of the accuracy of the individual parallaxes .",
    "revised _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes for cepheids agree with empirical predictions within the stated uncertainties of the former in only 108 of 207 cases , or @xmath149 versus expectations closer to @xmath144 , although @xmath150 of the outliers ( i.e. , @xmath151 of the complete sample ) fall within @xmath152 of the predicted values . conceivably some parallaxes are affected by systematic offsets , which would make comparisons with individual cluster cepheids of limited value and could affect conclusions regarding pulsation mode in some objects . as a precaution , _ hipparcos _ parallaxes were omitted from further steps in the testing procedure .",
    "it is important to consider four features of the pl calibration resulting from cepheids in clusters and groups .",
    "first , there exists a very tight linear relationship between the luminosity of a cepheid and its period of pulsation .",
    "second , the relationship is not `` kinked '' or bent in any fashion .",
    "it describes cepheids of all periods equally well .",
    "third , it is impossible to establish a metallicity dependence for the relationship because of the small spread in [ fe / h ] values for existing galactic calibrators .",
    "lastly , the cluster calibration of the cepheid pl relation exhibits a scatter amounting to only @xmath153 s.d . for individual calibrators , or @xmath154 s.e . for the entire sample .",
    "that may improve once detailed studies are complete for some of the cepheids in table  [ tab3 ] for which only preliminary results are available .    a comparison with similarly - derived luminosities for cepheids with well established _ hst _",
    "parallaxes @xcite produces essentially identical results , although the period coverage is less uniform .",
    "the unusual period - absolute magnitude relationship resulting from _ hst _ parallaxes @xcite is demonstrated to be a consequence of a pathological choice of calibrators : the long period cepheids ( @xmath155 ) in the sample all lie on the cool side of the instability strip and have overly small luminosities , and the short period cepheids all lie towards the center or hot side of the instability strip and have overly large luminosities .",
    "the selection of cepheid calibrators for the pl relation clearly affects the results obtained .",
    "an important factor affecting such an analysis is the reddening of individual cepheids . given that wesenheit formulations are generally designed to correct for the effects of interstellar reddening",
    ", they would appear to be the instrument of choice for studies of cepheid distances .",
    "there is an alternative available using luminosities directly , as demonstrated here , but it is difficult to apply such a relationship in distant galaxies where only visible and near - infrared photometry is typically available for member cepheids . a wesenheit formulation can be derived from the @xmath75 data of table  [ tab3 ] , adjusted by 0.04 to account for the need of a possible zero - point shift in the calibrated zero - age main sequence , and the _ hst _ parallax data in table  [ tab4 ] , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . for this purpose a color term of 3.3 was adopted ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a non - parametric fit to the data produces a relationship described by : @xmath156        as a test of the validity of the resulting relationship for extragalactic cepheids , an analysis was made using the data from @xcite for cepheids in the inner regions of ngc 4258 , where metallicities appear to be close to the solar values typical of nearby galactic calibrators .",
    "the available _ bv _ data for the galaxy s cepheids @xcite were analyzed using the wesenheit formulation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "although the scatter is larger than for galactic calibrators , the agreement is otherwise excellent , particularly the trend with period , which depends heavily upon the wesenheit formulation and the validity of the galactic calibration over all pulsation periods .",
    "restricting the sample to inner region cepheids with @xmath157 , as suggested by @xcite as a means of eliminating bias arising from contaminated cepheids , and eliminating a few outliers yields a distance modulus for ngc 4258 of @xmath158 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath159 mpc .",
    "that value agrees closely with the geometrical distance estimate of @xmath160 mpc obtained by @xcite using oh masers .",
    "cepheids in the outer regions of ngc 4258 yield a distance modulus of @xmath161 , the @xmath162 difference relative to the value obtained for cepheids lying in the inner regions of ngc 4258 presumably being tied to the lower metallicity of outer region cepheids .",
    "the sole remaining factor affecting cepheid distances remains the treatment of interstellar and intergalactic reddening .",
    "the zero - point established by galactic calibrators lying in calibrating clusters and groups or having _ hst _ parallaxes appears to be very solid , and eliminates the need to rely on magellanic cloud cepheids @xcite or surface brightness relations @xcite to establish the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "the near - solar metallicities of most galactic calibrators also make them more similar to the cepheids sampled in other spiral galaxies , an important factor when adjusting distances for metallicity effects , certainly in the _ b _ and _ v _ bands used here .",
    "the manner of treating reddening affects the wesenheit formulation , however , and may also influence the technique of pl - fitting in different wavelength bands ( _ e.g. _ , _ r _ and _ i _ ) that are used in most extragalactic studies .",
    "any differences between the extinction properties of dust in nearby regions of the galaxy and those in other galaxies may yet have an important influence on the extragalactic distance scale .",

    "<S> the rationale behind recent calibrations of the cepheid pl relation using the wesenheit formulation is reviewed and reanalyzed , and it is shown that recent conclusions regarding a possible change in slope of the pl relation for short - period and long - period cepheids are tied to a pathological distribution of _ hst _ calibrators within the instability strip . </S>",
    "<S> a recalibration of the period - luminosity relation is obtained using galactic cepheids in open clusters and groups , the resulting relationship , described by @xmath0 , exhibiting only the moderate scatter expected from color spread within the instability strip . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship is confirmed by cepheids with _ hst _ parallaxes , </S>",
    "<S> although without the need for lutz - kelker corrections , and in general by cepheids with revised _ hipparcos _ </S>",
    "<S> parallaxes , albeit with concerns about the cited precisions of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> a wesenheit formulation of @xmath1 for galactic cepheids is tested successfully using cepheids in the inner regions of the galaxy ngc 4258 , confirming the independent geometrical distance established for the galaxy from oh masers . </S>",
    "<S> differences between the extinction properties of interstellar and extragalactic dust may yet play an important role in the further calibration of the cepheid pl relation and its application to the extragalactic distance scale . </S>"
