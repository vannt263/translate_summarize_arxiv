    "a double stranded dna ( dsdna ) molecule consists of two polynucleotide strands connected loosely by hydrogen bonds through the base pairs and base - stacking between nearest neighbour pairs of base pairs and wound around each other to make a helix .",
    "the constraints of this helical structure require that the two base sequences on opposite strands must be complementary , with adenine ( a ) always binding to thymine ( t ) and guanine ( g ) binding to cytosine ( c ) @xcite .",
    "the force that holds the complementary strands of dna together is an important regulator of life s processes because the binding of regulatory proteins to dna often involves the procedure of mechanical separation of its strands .",
    "the intermolecular forces of dna have been studied extensively using a variety of techniques , which cover a broad range of forces from a few piconewton(pn ) up to several hundred piconewtons ( pns ) .",
    "these techniques use either atomic force microscopy ( afm ) or laser optical traps and magnetic tweezers @xcite .",
    "the experiments fall into two general categories ; those conducted on short dna and those on long dna .",
    "experiments on long dna focussed on the overall properties of the molecule @xcite and resulted in the discovery of s - dna @xcite ; the occurance of this so called b - s transition has also been found in a short dna chain of 30 base pairs @xcite . those on short duplexes focussed on the reaction pathway of melting , and contributed to the understanding of the local unbinding of dna @xcite . in the single molecule experiments ,",
    "the result may depend on choice of which variables are fixed and which can fluctuate . in some of the experiments ( like afm ) extension is fixed and force is allowed to fluctuate ( constant extension ensemble ) while in others ( like magnetic tweezers ) the force is fixed and extension is allowed to fluctuate ( constant force ensemble ) .",
    "when a force is applied to pull apart the two strands from one end of a dsdna molecule in a direction perpendicular to the helical axis , bases are sequentially stretched as the duplex is unzipped . on the other hand , in shear unzipping",
    "in which the applied force pulls the two strands from opposite ends as shown in fig.1 , the stretching is spread out over many base pairs .",
    "the study of distribution of shearing force along the length of a dna molecule may lead to valuable informations about the force distribution across the phosphate backbone of a single strand of dna versus the force distribution across the paired bases of complementory dna .",
    "such informations are of relevance not only to understanding the biological processes but also in material science application such as determining the strength of dna / gold nanoparticle assemblies @xcite .    following the work of lee et al .",
    "@xcite many workers @xcite measured the value of shear force which separates the two strands of a dsdna molecule .",
    "it was found that the force increases linearly with the length .",
    "using a simple ladder model of dna and expressing the backbone bond energy as well as the interaction energy among complementary bases in the form of harmonic springs , de gennes @xcite in 2001 predicted that the critical force for shear unzipping which for short chains shows linear dependence would saturate to a finite value in the limit where the number of base pairs approaches infinity and that the shear stress relaxes over a distance ( number of base pairs ) @xmath2 ( = @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the spring constant characteristic of stretching the backbone , and r is the spring constant characterstic of stretching the hydrogen bonds between base pairs ) on either side of the chain . the critical force @xmath0 for shear unzipping as a function of number of bound base pairs was given @xcite as f_c=2f_c[^-1tanh()+1 ] .",
    "where @xmath5 is the rupture force of a single bond and ( n+1 ) is the number of base pairs in the molecule .",
    "chakrabarti and nelson @xcite have generalized the simple harmonic model of degennes @xcite by representing the interaction among complimentary bases by the lennard - jones ( 12 - 6 ) potential model and found that the strain is indeed localized over a narrow range of @xmath2 on either side of the chain and the chain unzips when the force exceeds a critical value of @xmath6 for short chains and @xmath7 for long ones as predicted by degennes @xcite .",
    "it may , however , be noted that the calculations of degennes @xcite and also of chakrabarti and nelson @xcite correspond to zero temperature . the langevin dynamics simulation has recently been used to study shear unzipping of dsdna at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the results found for @xmath0 are in agreement with the results of degennes @xcite and chakrabarti and nelson @xcite .",
    "hatch et al .",
    "@xcite have measured the value of @xmath0 for several dsdna molecules of length ranging from 12 to 50 base pairs at the room temperature and found that @xmath0 is linear function of molecular length only up to 20 base pairs and approaches to an asymptotic value as the number of base pairs increases .",
    "in fact they found that @xmath0 for a molecule of 32 base pairs has already reached within @xmath8 of the asymptotic value which was found to be 61.4 pn .",
    "but when hatch et al .",
    "@xcite tried to fit their data to eq.(1 ) they found that this can be done only by assuming 7 base pairs of all chains to be in the open state , i.e. the effective length of a molecule of ( n+1 ) base pairs is ( n-6 ) irrespective of the value of n. they attributed this to temperature effect as degennes calculation did not include temperature .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the value of @xmath0 as a function of the number of base pairs at room temperature and compare our results with the experimental data of hatch et al .",
    "@xcite and show that the need to adjust the length of a molecule is not as much due to temperature as due to use of the values of @xmath5 and @xmath9 in eq.(1 ) and the nature of the curve of @xmath0 @xmath10 n. we derive another form of eq.(1 ) and show that with reasonable choice of values of @xmath5 and @xmath9 one gets values of @xmath0 which are in better agreement with experiment without adjusting the length of molecules than that found from eq.(1 ) . the model which we describe in sec .",
    "ii is similar to the nonlinear scaler displacement model of chakarbarti and nelson @xcite .",
    "we calculate the force in both the constant force and constant extension ensembles . the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii we describe the model and calculational procedures . in sec iii",
    "we give results found for distribution of effects created by shear force along the length of a molecule and the value of @xmath0 as a function of number of base pairs . in sec",
    "iv we compare our results with those of degennes @xcite and with the experimental values @xcite .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief comment given at the end of sec iv .",
    "we consider a dsdna molecule of length ( n+1 ) base pairs which both 5@xmath11-ends ( or both 3@xmath11-ends ) are pulled along the helical ( molecular ) axis by a force @xmath12 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the displacements of @xmath13 nucleotide from its equilibrium position are denoted by @xmath14 for one ( the lower one in fig.1 ) single stranded dna ( ssdna ) chain and by @xmath15 for the other ( the upper one ) chain .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xcite    h=&&_i =- n/2^n/2 - 1+_i =- n/2^n/2v(|*u*_i -*v*_i| ) + & & -*f*.(*u*_n/2-*v*_-n/2 ) .",
    "the first term of this equation represents the stretching energy of nucleotides , excecuting a simple harmonic motion with a spring constant @xmath4 along each chains in dsdna . in the second term",
    ", @xmath16 represents the potential energy of interaction between bases in the @xmath17 pair and the last term of eq.(2 ) represents the energy contribution due to the shear stress . in writing eq.(2 )",
    "we did not include the contribution arising due to the helicity of dna as this effect was found to be negligible by hatch et al . @xcite and also by lavery and lebrun @xcite .    for the potential @xmath16 we use a simple model which has a hard - core repulsion and a long range attraction ,    @xmath18    = - for > 0 .",
    "here @xmath19 is the magnitude of increase in length of hydrogen bonds connecting bases in the @xmath20 pair from its equilibrium value , @xmath21 is the depth of potential at the equilibrium separation and @xmath22 is the diameter of dsdna ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the repulsion represents the steric hindrance which forbids the molecule from getting compressed along the bond linking the bases with respect to its equilibrium value . from fig.2",
    "one finds ,    ( 1+)= ( 1+)^1/2 ,    we take the value of @xmath22 equal to @xmath23 which is the diameter of the _ canonical _ dna ( b - dna ) at room temperature .    since in shear unzipping",
    ", a molecule is stretched along its axis we consider the longitudinal displacements of nucleotides and neglect the transverse displacements ; the transverse displacements have been found in ref @xcite an order of magnitude smaller than those in the direction of shear .",
    "we define new variables ,    x_i= , y_i= ,    where , @xmath24 and @xmath25 now represent the longitudinal displacements of respective strands . in the notations used here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive when the @xmath26 nucleotide of upper and lower strands move to _ r.h.s . _ and negative when they move to _",
    "l.h.s._. for the experimental situation shown in fig .",
    "1 it is clear that for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and magnitute of @xmath24 is greater than that of @xmath25 and for @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the magnitute of @xmath25 is greater than that of @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to following relation for variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 ;    x_-i =- x_i , x_0=0 and y_-i = y_i .",
    "when we substitute these variables in eq.(2 ) it decouples into two independent components ;    h = h_x+h_y ,    where    h_x=_i =- n/2^n/2 - 1(x_i+1-x_i)^2 -(x_n/2-x_-n/2 ) , and    h_y=_i =- n/2^n/2 - 1(y_i+1-y_i)^2 + _ i =- n/2^n/2v(y_i)-(y_n/2+y_-n/2 ) .    here",
    "the potential @xmath16 defined in eq.(3 ) is expressed in terms of variable @xmath32 .",

    "note that the expression of @xmath33 does not contain the on - site potential @xmath34 and simply corresponds to a harmonic chain which is being pulled at the two ends by a force @xmath35 whereas the expression of @xmath36 contains the on - site potential @xmath34 as well as the force term .    in view of the relations given by eq.(6 ) the average value of displacement @xmath37 of @xmath38 base pair can be calculated from the relation ,    = , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath41 is the temperature . since for @xmath33 given by eq.(7 ) the integrals in eq.(11 ) are gaussians , one can solve them analytically to give = n.    this result agrees with the one found by degennes @xcite",
    ".    the average value of displacement @xmath42 of @xmath43 base pair can be found from the relation , = .",
    "the integrals appearing in this expression can not be evaluated analytically because of the form of on - site potential @xmath34 . however , for the expression of @xmath36 given by eq.(9 ) the integral appearing in eq.(13 ) reduces to multiplication of ( @xmath44 ) matrices .",
    "the discretization of the coordinate variable and introduction of a proper cut - off on the maximum values of @xmath45 determine the size of the matrices .",
    "we have taken -40@xmath46 and 40@xmath46 as the lower and upper limit of integration for each co - ordinate variable and discretized space using the gaussian - legendre method with the number of grid points equal to 900 . by changing the limits of integration as well as the number of grid points we made it sure that the values of @xmath47 are independent of the limit of integration and the number of grid points chosen to discretize coordinate variable .",
    "when a shear force is applied on a dsdna molecule , its two ssdna strands get pulled in opposite directions as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the bonds in the backbone of dna as well as bonds connecting bases in a pair are stretched . in a case of @xmath4",
    "being infinitely large the two strands will move like a rigid body pulling all base pairs in the sequence in parallel .",
    "the effect of the shear force will then be uniformly distributed across all of the base pairs . however , if @xmath4 is finite , then both the backbone and the base pairs will stretch when a shear force is applied .",
    "the effect of the shear force may then be confined to limited lengths on both ends of the molecule . to see how the effect caused by shearing of a dsdna molecule is distributed along the length of a molecule and how this depends on the energies associated with the stretching of backbone and base pairs we calculate the value of @xmath47 from eq.(13 ) for different values of @xmath48 when the two end base pairs are stretched to a given length by the shear force .",
    "in fig.3 we plot our results for four dsdna molecules of length 17 , 25 , 33 and 49 base pairs and for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the values shown in the figure correspond to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath55 and @xmath56 are allowed to be free ( i.e.@xmath57 ) , then @xmath47 is found to be zero for all @xmath48 . from fig.3",
    "it is clear that for short chains the effect created by shear force is distributed along the entire length of a molecule affecting all base pairs , whereas , for relatively larger molecules the base pairs in the central part of molecules are only marginally affected .",
    "for example , for a molecule of length 17 base pairs the value of @xmath58 is 1.76@xmath59 when @xmath60 , whereas , for the similar situation ( i.e. @xmath61 ) the value of @xmath58 for a molecule of length 49 base pairs is only 0.27@xmath59 .",
    "the qualitative nature of these results are in agreement with the results found in refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the other point to be noted from the figure is that the qualitative nature of the distribution of the effect of shear stretching along length of a molecule is same for all values of @xmath62 plotted in the figure .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the value of @xmath58 when @xmath62 = 2.38@xmath59 as a function of length of dsdna molecules .",
    "as discussed below , the value of @xmath62 = 2.38@xmath59 is assumed to be the critical value of stretching in the sense that initiation of separation of two strands starts at this value of @xmath56 and the shear force which creates this value of stretching of the end base pairs is equal to @xmath0 , the minimum ( or critical ) force required to separate the two strands of a dsdna molecule . from figs . 3 and 4 it is clear that as one moves from either ends the differential force across the base pairs decreases and becomes very small at the centre for larger molecules but",
    "has not become zero at the centre even for a molecule of length 49 base pairs .",
    "the extension of the curve of fig.4 shows that it would be zero at the centre only for molecules of length larger than 80 base pairs .",
    "the average value of displacements @xmath63 and @xmath64 of @xmath65 base pair can be found from the known values of @xmath37 and @xmath47 . from eq.(5 ) one gets = and < v_n>=. in fig.5 we plot the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 as a function of @xmath48 for molecules of length 17 , 21 and 49 base pairs . the values plotted in this figure correspond to @xmath66 = 2.38@xmath59 and f=40.9 , 47.4 and 60.6 pn , respectively for molecules of length 17 , 21 and 49 base pairs .",
    "these values of force , as is shown below , are the critical force of shearing of the respective molecules . from the figure we note that while for a molecule of 17 base pairs the entire ssdna strand moves in the direction of applied force whereas in the case of a molecule of 49 base pairs nearly half of the strand moves in the opposite direction . while for a molecule of 17 base pairs , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , for a molecule of 49 base pairs @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "as long as the entire ssdna strand moves in the direction of applied force the shear force , as explained in ref @xcite , depends linearly on molecular length .",
    "the departure from the linear dependence of the shear force on molecular length is expected to take place when @xmath75 and @xmath76 become zero i.e. the displacement of nucleotides on the opposite side of a ssdna strand remains unaffected by the applied force .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath77 and @xmath78=0 for a molecule of length 21 base pairs whcih is in very good agreement with the experimental value @xcite .",
    "since for molecules of base pairs larger than 21 , part of a ssdna moves in the opposite direction , a region develops inbetween on each strand which remains unaffected by the force .",
    "this region moves towards the centre on increasing the molecular length ; the force gets saturated as soon as the region reaches the centre of the chain and stays there on further increasing the molecular length .",
    "the value of shear force needed to separate the two strands of a dsdna molecule can be calculated in two different ways . in one ,",
    "we follow a method proposed by degennes @xcite and which from hereon is referred to as a method of constant force ensemble .",
    "the other method is based on the constant extension ensemble .    in the method of constant force ensemble",
    "one first defines a critical distance @xmath79 for the rupture of a base pair ( i.e. when @xmath42 of @xmath65 base pair becomes larger than @xmath79 the bases of the pair become free ) and calculate the value of force which can stretch a base pair to the critical distance @xmath79 .",
    "this force can be found from the on - site potential @xmath80 . thus f_c=",
    "-|_y=|y = ( 1+)^-4 .",
    "if we take the value of @xmath81 , we find @xmath82 for the value of @xmath21 and @xmath4 given above .",
    "this value of @xmath5 is close to the value used by hatch et al @xcite to fit their experimental data and the value estimated by chakrabarti and nelson @xcite . to rupture the end base pairs of a given molecule",
    "they must be stretched by the shear force to distance @xmath79 .",
    "the balance of force at one ends of one of the ssdna gives @xcite ;    f_c=(<u_n/2>-<u_n/2 - 1>)+f_c . using the relations of eq.(5 ) and eq.(12 )",

    "is shown by dotted line in fig.6 .    in the constant extension ensemble one",
    "first calculate the work done in stretching the two end base pairs of a given molecule to distance @xmath85 .",
    "this work is found from the relation w(y)=[ln z_n+1(y)-lnz_n+1 ] , where z_n+1(y)=_i =- n/2^n/2dy_i(y_-n/2-y)(y_n/2-y ) , is the constrained partition function and z_n+1=_i =- n/2^n/2dy_i . is the partition function .",
    "@xmath86 is the dirac function .",
    "we used the matrix multipliction method to evaluate @xmath87 from the above equations for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath54 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath85 gives the average force @xmath90 that is needed to keep the extension of end base pairs of a given molecule equal to @xmath85 .",
    "thus f(y)=. to get the value of critical force we have to chose a value of @xmath85 which corresponds to rupturing of base pairs .",
    "the values shown in fig.6 by dashed line are found when @xmath85 was taken equal to @xmath50 ; this value is slightly lower than the one taken for the constant force ensemble .",
    "the difference in the value of critical stretching in the two ensembles may be due to difference in the path of unzipping .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath0 found by methods of the constant force and the constant extension ensembles are close but not identical .",
    "the difference between the two as expected @xcite is large for molecules of smaller lengths but they becomes close as molecular length increases .",
    "both methods give the same asymptotic value , equal to 61.2pn , which is in very good agreement with the experimental value 61.4pn @xcite .",
    "the experimental values shown in the figure are of hatch et al @xcite . in view of large spread in experimental data",
    "we find good agreement between experimental values of @xmath0 and the theoretical values found using the constant force ensemble as well as the constant extension ensemble .",
    "since the experimental values @xcite of @xmath0 given in fig.6 are found using the fixed force ensemble , we concentrate our discussion with the theoretical values found using the same ensemble and shown in fig.6 by dotted line .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent except for a molecule of length 12 base pairs .",
    "we know that at a given temperature shorter dsdna molecules are less stable compared to longer molecules .",
    "it is quite possible that at room temperature due to surface effects few of base pairs at the two ends of a molecule of length 12 base pairs are nearly in open state .",
    "the curve shown in fig.6 by solid line is found when the effective length of a molecule of length 12 base pairs is taken to be equal to 10 base pairs and that of a molecule of length 16 base pairs equal to 15 base pairs .",
    "the values of force @xmath0 shown by solid line is in excellent agreement with the experimental values for the entire range of molecular length investigated by hatch et al . @xcite .",
    "the saturation value of @xmath0 found to be 61.2 pn is also in very good agreement with the experimental value of 61.4 pn @xcite .      in order to compare our results with those of degennes @xcite",

    "the values found from eq.(1 ) are very different from both experimental values and values shown by dotted line . in ref",
    "@xcite the value of @xmath96 as a function of n were found to be in good agreement with the values found from eq.(1 ) for @xmath97 .",

    "we now examine whether such an adjustment of length is essential or there is some other reason for not getting good agreement .    in the appendix we derive eq.(24 ) from eq.(9 ) and show that @xmath9 which appears in eq.(24 ) should be defined as @xmath9=@xmath99 . substituting the values of @xmath4 and r we find @xmath2=9.2 which is close to 9.4 found by using the values",

    ", we developed a method to calculate the distribution of shear force along the length of a dsdna molecule at a finite temeprature .",
    "the value of shear force @xmath0 which is required to separate the two strands of a molecule has been calculated in both the constant force and the constant extension ensembles .",
    "the values of @xmath0 found by these methods differ for molecules of shorter length but approach to each other as length increases .",
    "both methods gave the saturation value equal to 61.2 pn which is in very good agreement with the experimental value 61.4pn .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is found to increase linearly with length up to 21 base pairs in agreement with experimental results .",
    "the plots of @xmath63 and @xmath64 given in fig.5 show that as long as the applied force pulls the entire strand in its direction of application , @xmath0 depends linearly on length of molecules .",
    "the departure from linear behaviour takes place when part of a strand moves in opposite direction under the influence of force pulling the other strand .",
    "the saturation value is achieved when half of a strand moves in the direction of force applied on it and the other half in the opposite direction .",
    "it is shown that the value of @xmath0 quickly attains its saturation value on increasing length of dna molecule ; for a molecule of 32 base pairs @xmath0= 57.0pn as compared to saturation value 61.2pn .",
    "the agreement between theorectical and experimental values of @xmath0 shown in fig.6 indicates that the model proposed in this paper is capable of describing the responses of dsdna molecules to shear stress .",
    "the model , however , neglects the effect of helicity of dna and has assumed the molecule to be homogeneous . as far as the effect of helicity is concerned , it has already been shown to be negligible by hatch et al .",
    "@xcite and by lavery and lebrun @xcite .",
    "the effect of heterogenity arising due to random distribution of a - t and c - g base pairs in a sequence is also expected to be small as long as the shear unzipping from the two ends is symmetric .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that although the molecules investigated by hatch et al @xcite are heterogeneous with half g - c and half a - t base pairs , yet their response to shear stress is described very well by a model which assumes molecules to be homogeneous .",
    "the values of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath4 will , however , depend on the percentage of a - t and c - g base pairs in a given sequence and on the temperature .",
    "but , in the absence of symmetry in the unzipping from the two ends a qualitative new features , as argued in ref @xcite , may arise .",
