    "the detection of nonthermal high energy magnetospheric emission from isolated pulsars has remained a non - trivial problem , despite great advances in instrumentation and technological expertise . to date , only 7 optical pulsars have been detected with emission believed to be magnetospherically dominated , and despite considerable effort , only 8 @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "in contrast to radio emission , which is generally believed to be generated in close proximity to the magnetic poles , no clear theoretical model construct exists as regards the higher energies .",
    "the two principal schools of thought place @xmath0-ray emission localised either to the magnetic poles ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) or located further out in the magnetosphere ( romani 1996 ) .",
    "considerable problems remain with these two frameworks , in terms of predicted fluxes , spectral indices and light curve morphologies , and it is clear that further work is required on this subject .",
    "this is all the more relevant when one attempts to address the growing empirical database of lower energy emission , in particular in the optical regime . a consequence of non - linear processes within the magnetosphere , this synchrotron emission forms a useful constraint with which one can attempt to comprehensively develop a self - consistent theoretical framework .",
    "consequently it is important to try and acquire synchrotron ( optical / x - ray ) data of known @xmath0-ray pulsars , and so extend this empirical database .",
    "the pulsar psr b1951 + 32 , located within the complex combination supernova remnant ( snr ) ctb 80 , was first identified as a steep - spectrum , point - like source in the radio ( strom 1987 ) , and discovery of radio pulses with an unusually fast 39.5-s period quickly followed ( kulkarni et al .",
    "canonically , the pulsar s age and the estimated dynamical age of the snr are consistent at @xmath3 yrs ( koo et al .",
    "1990 ) and both have been determined to be at a distance of @xmath2 2.5 kpc .",
    "there is thus general agreement that the association is valid .",
    "evidence for pulsed emission was subsequently found in @xmath0-rays ( ramanamurthy et al .",
    "1995 ) and possibly in x - rays ( safi - harb et al . 1995 ; chang & ho 1997 ) , with upper limits in the infrared ( clifton et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the rosat observations in the x - ray regime do indicate a complex light curve strongly dominated by the intense x - ray radiation of a pulsar - powered synchrotron nebula ( safi - harb et al .",
    "1995 ; becker & truemper 1996 ) .",
    "the unambiguous double - peaked @xmath0-ray ( egret ) light curve obtained by ramanamurthy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) at the appropriate spin - down ephemeris suggested that the pulsar had a conversion efficiency , in terms of rotational energy to @xmath0-rays , of @xmath2 0.004 .",
    "consequently there are strong grounds for the possibility of an optical detection .    however , the pulsar is quite distant and located within a rather complex snr .",
    "recent radio observations at 92 cm ( strom & stappers 2000 ) indicate that the pulsar is located at the edge of the flat radio spectrum core of the snr , and it is clear from x - ray observations that the pulsar is to some extent interacting with its environment . from models such as pacini & salvati ( 1987 ) and",
    "shearer & golden ( 2001 ) we would expect emission in the @xmath4 magnitude range 24 - 26 depending upon the line of sight absorption , estimated from e(b - v ) = 0.8 - 1.4 ( blair et al . 1984 ) .",
    "ground - based ccd observations by blair & schild ( 1985 ) and fesen & gull ( 1985 ) yielded a relatively crowded field with two possible counterparts at @xmath5 20 and @xmath5 21 respectively ( known hereafter as counterparts 1 and 2 ) .    using a ground - based mama detector in the triffid camera , we have previously examined the central field of ctb 80 , but could find no evidence of pulsations in either @xmath6 or @xmath4 from these two counterparts ( osullivan et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "it was noted that counterpart 1 had an extension ( see fig .",
    "[ mama_v_ext ] ) towards the mapped radio timing position given in table  [ psr_radio ] , which implied an unresolved stellar combination and/or plerionic / remnant material . using psf - fitting and deconvolution techniques ,",
    "the removal of counterpart 1 yielded a best - estimate imposed decomposition of the `` extension '' into two further point sources ( numbered 4 and 5 in fig .",
    "[ mama_v_ext ] ) , while a further point source ( numbered 6 in fig .  [ mama_v_ext ] ) was detected some distance further away .",
    "these 3 sources had apparent magnitudes of @xmath7 @xmath8 22.1/@xmath9 @xmath8 0.8 , @xmath7 @xmath8 22.6/@xmath9 @xmath8 0.6 , and @xmath7 @xmath8 23.1/@xmath9 @xmath8 0.0 . however ,",
    "none of them exhibited pulsed emission at the 1% level . as was noted , both the photometry and time series analysis were complicated by their low signal - to - noise and proximity to counterpart 1 .",
    "it is clear that in order to unambiguously resolve the various apparent components within the radio error ellipse , diffraction - limited photometry must be obtained , which would facilitate further attempts to detect optical pulsations from the suspected optical counterpart(s ) to psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "consequently we obtained from the hst archive wfpc2 images of the ctb 80 snr obtained with the f547w , f673n , f656n , and f502n passbands . in the next section",
    "we detail the reduction of the various exposures and their astrometric and photometric analyses . from this",
    "we assess the feasibility that we have identified new plausible optical counterparts , and assess the implications - both in terms of follow - up high speed 2-d photometry , and for current theoretical models .",
    "we obtained from the hst archive all existing wfpc2 data of the ctb 80 snr , as listed in table  [ hst_archive ] .",
    "the core of the ctb 80 remnant lies on chip wf3 of the wfpc2 camera in every case .",
    "image processing and photometry were performed using the iraf ( tody 1993 ) , stsdas , and daophot - ii ( stetson 1994 ) packages .",
    "the images in each band and chip were stacked and cleaned of cosmic rays and hot pixels using standard techniques .",
    "the f547 m intermediate - width band enabled us to perform a deep photometric search for faint stellar sources , to s / n=2 at mag@xmath10 = 26.7 .",

    "the average absolute pointing error of hst is 0@xmath148 @xmath15 1@xmath145 ( biretta et al .",
    "2000 ) , due to errors in the guide star catalog ( gsc ) .",
    "spacecraft roll can cause an additional shift of up to 1@xmath145 .",
    "this degree of uncertainty , in this relatively crowded field , would make it impossible to pin down the identification of a probable optical counterpart to psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "therefore , using 31 stars on chip wf3 in common with the new 2mass point source catalog , and an iterative matching and fitting process , we derived a much improved astrometric solution with a total rms error of only 0@xmath1415 .",
    "the various published radio coordinates for psr b1951 + 32 from the literature were filtered to yield only those which were judged to be fully independent of each other , and based either on genuine interferometric observations or on a timing solution which had not been affected by a glitch ( although susceptible to timing noise ) .",

    "the 10.2 yr difference for the radio timing position resulted in a correction of @xmath19 in a wsw direction ; the interferometric position was corrected by @xmath20 in the same direction , due to its 8.7 yr difference .",

    "it is also clear that this object is within the combined radio / optical error region for psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "however , there is a problem with this photometric result for object 1@xmath23 .",
    "an inspection of the resulting star - subtracted image shows that mag@xmath10 = 24.3 must be an overestimation of the flux of the apparent point source within the nebula , as the fitting - and - subtraction process does not result in a smooth underlying background , but rather a pronounced `` hole '' in the nebula .",
    "this is a consequence of three probable factors : the undersampling of the wf3 psf , coupled with the rapidly changing background in the vicinity of the source , and the possibility that the source is not a pure point - source but may be broadened by being embedded in a knot of the nebulosity .    to investigate this issue we performed the following test .",
    "the position of the source 1@xmath23 , as determined by daophot - ii / allstar , was kept constant , while its magnitude was varied from mag@xmath10 = 21 - 29 in steps of 0.5 magnitude . at each magnitude",
    "it was subtracted from the original image and aperture photometry was performed on the resulting subtracted image , in order to measure the residual flux level within the central core pixels of the source .",

    ", one would expect to see subtraction smoothness of the same order as had been achieved for stars of the same brightness elsewhere in the field .",
    "the conclusion is that , to first order , the source would have to have mag@xmath10 @xmath26 25.2 to prevent _ oversubtraction _ into the nebula ; and _ undersubtraction _ would occur at mag@xmath10 @xmath26 26.2 .",
    "the magnitude of object 1@xmath23 therefore lies within this interval , but its @xmath25 would be reduced to @xmath82 - 2.5 .",
    "the question then arises , could one normally detect such a faint source as object 1@xmath23 in this data without these corrections , or is it spurious ?",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations in order to test this hypothesis . using the psf shape and photometric zeropoint previously determined for the f547 m image",
    ", artificial stars were added into the 512x512 pixel region centred on the nominal pulsar position .",
    "for each 0.5 magnitude step from mag@xmath10 = 21 - 29 , 25 stars were added to this field at random positions , and then the same automatic star detection and measurement process was repeated in order to try to recover them .",
    "this entire process was repeated 100 times for robust statistics on the efficiency of star detection with increasing magnitude .",
    "then , to take into account the effect of the higher background within the small nebula , which increases the sky noise , the simulations were repeated with the background everywhere increased to the mean background within the small nebula .",
    "the results are shown by the two traces in fig .",
    "[ mag_limits ] . clearly , there is a good ( between @xmath8 60% - 80% ) probability of detecting a point source as faint as mag@xmath10 = 25.5 - 26.5 .",
    "the _ level _ of the increased nebular background is shown to have only a very marginal effect on star detection ( although the _ gradients _ within the nebular background are likely causes for bias in the photometric measurement , as has already been noted ) .    crucially , the estimated magnitude of mag@xmath10 = 25.2 - 26.2 for object 1@xmath23 , including the correction for the oversubtraction effect , is within the range predicted by the successful mode framework of pacini & salvati ( 1987 ) and more recently the phenomenological analysis of shearer & golden ( 2001 ) .",
    "the magnitude of object 4@xmath23 is also consistent with these models , at the brighter end of the predicted range .",

    "both candidates lie within a region of area @xmath8 1 arcsec@xmath27 . to estimate the probability of unrelated field stars being found within this region and at the same magnitude as the candidates",
    ", we computed a luminosity function ( lf ) for the total measured stellar content of the three near - identical wf chips - wf3 containing the pulsar field , and wf2 and wf4 abutting it and containing similar starfields .",

    "thus the probability of finding two such objects an arcsecond apart is significant , but low .",
    "hester ( 2000a ) has reported on a similar analysis of the same archival hst data , and agrees that the knot of extended continuum emission is synchrotron dominated as a consequence of the pulsar wind .",

    "we have reproduced his results by mapping the foster et al .",
    "( 1994 ) radio timing position onto the _ original _ gsc - based astrometric solution from the hst data pipeline .",

    "the agreement , in terms of synchrotron luminosity from the nebula , is compelling , regardless of which of the two astrometric solutions are used , since they overlap within their errors .",
    "however the location of the pulsar is still uncertain , given the considerable discrepancy between the two best independent radio positions .",
    "we have outlined the evolution in these radio positions and optical astrometric solutions which , taken together , locate the pulsar in an error region which is still too large to definitively pin down the pulsar s optical counterpart ; however the more accurate mapped radio position ( in terms of formal quoted errors ) lies to the east / se of the nebula .",
    "this supports the geometric orientation suggested by hester ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "one of the two newly resolved sources which we have identified as 1@xmath23 and 4@xmath23 may therefore indeed be the @xmath2 24th-26th magnitude pulsar as predicted by the models of pacini & salvati ( 1987 ) and shearer & golden ( 2001 ) .",
    "the other possibilities are that both are unrelated field stars , or that 1@xmath23 is a localised ` knot ' within the bigger ` knot ' of the synchrotron nebula while 4@xmath23 is a field star ; both of these possibilities would imply that the true optical counterpart is fainter still .",
    "this would possibly reconcile one difficulty with the present analysis - the inconsistency of the two new candidates with the formally small error ellipse of the radio timing position ; but it would create another difficulty - the inconsistency of candidates fainter than 26th magnitude with the phenomenological model predictions . deeper hst and/or diffraction - limited adaptive optics imaging will be needed to determine which of these various possibilities is the correct interpretation , by putting some hard constraints on the colour and spectral index of both the synchrotron nebulosity and the candidate counterparts .",
    "goldoni et al .",
    "( 1995 ) noted that the optical spectral index _ steepened _ with age for the known optically emitting pulsars , while shearer & golden ( 2001 ) showed that this is consistent with the flattening of the pulse - peak luminosity relationship with the outer field strength .",
    "consequently , with its expected steep optical spectral index , one would expect that the optical counterpart to psr b1951 + 32 will not be as distinctly blue as younger crab - like pulsars , but nevertheless distinguishable from regular thermally - emitting stars .",
    "additionally , one could test the candidates by looking for proper motion , which ( since the epoch of these hst observations ) should now amount to a possibly detectable @xmath28 .",
    "follow - up timing studies with the upgraded triffid imaging photon - counting camera would permit the search for optical pulsations from a securely identified counterpart , with much higher statistical significance than previously . not only would this provide the essential confirmation of any optical counterpart , it would also test the hitherto successful optical models of pacini & salvati ( 1987 ) and shearer & golden ( 2001 ) in an age regime where few optical pulsars have been found .",
