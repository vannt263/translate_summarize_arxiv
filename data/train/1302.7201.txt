    "the effect of neutrino oscillations in vacuum lies beyond the standard model and is thus interesting both from the theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "the oscillations in medium have also been studied since wolfenstein , who showed that neutrinos acquire a specific flavor - dependent potential due to coherent forward scattering on the matter @xcite . as a result",
    ", the neutrino propagation in medium should demonstrate the conversion from one flavor into another ( i.e. flavor oscillations ) , even if the vacuum mixing is negligible .",
    "this spectacular result is known as the mikheev ",
    "wolfenstein effect @xcite and suffices to explain the deficit of observed solar electron neutrinos @xcite . according to mikheev and smirnov , the leading - order estimation for the electron neutrino flux depends only on the points where the neutrino was born ( the core of the sun ) and absorbed ( the detector ) .",
    "however , the properties of the medium between these two points can also slightly affect the flavor composition of the observed neutrino flux , leading , in particular , to the day - night ( solar neutrino flavor ) asymmetry @xcite . the latter effect being crucial for the entire flavor oscillations framework , a number of experiments were set up to catch this slight flavor composition variation resulting from the nighttime neutrino propagation through the earth @xcite .",
    "some experiments , which should be sensitive enough to distinguish the effect , are also planned in the next decade and are now under construction @xcite .",
    "however , one should hold in mind that , in order to make a conclusion on the expected presence of the day - night asymmetry , one needs not only the experimental data ( in terms of event rates and energy spectra ) but also a convenient theoretical prediction .",
    "first experiments in neutrino oscillations were only aimed at outlining the domains in the neutrino mass and mixing parameter space which do not contradict the observed rates . for such needs ,",
    "the theoretical estimations obtained using numerical simulations are quite acceptable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . indeed , although numerical experiments can lack perfect accuracy in some regimes and do not give general results , the calculation of the desired effect can be performed for the entire parameter space without drastic algorithm changes . therefore , using numerical predictions , one could more or less interpret the experimental data in terms of domains in this parameter space which are excluded .",
    "but now that various neutrino experiments have yielded a considerable amount of data on the vacuum neutrino mixing @xcite and its parameters are fixed quite firmly , the question is whether other neutrino oscillation effects to be observed are consistent with the framework accepted so far .",
    "namely , one may ask : how should one compare the present and future experimental data on the day - night asymmetry with the theory of neutrino oscillations in order to make an ultimate conclusion about their agreement within the allowed class of earth and solar models ?",
    "the latter issue requires a formalism able to give strict constraints ( in a form of an interval with fixed boundaries ) on the predicted asymmetry within certain approximations , but valid within quite a wide class of the earth and solar models .",
    "developing such a formalism constitutes the principal goal of the present paper .",
    "in particular , using it , we readily find the constraints on the day - night asymmetry for beryllium and boron neutrinos observed in such experiments as sno , super - kamiokande , and borexino @xcite .    within the neutrino oscillations framework , it is common to use the schroedinger - like equation to describe the spatial variations of the neutrino flavor @xcite . within the two - flavor approximation ,",
    "the schroedinger problem is posed in terms of the @xmath0 flavor evolution matrix ( operator ) @xmath1 , whose elements are the neutrino flavor transition amplitudes after traveling from point @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution equation and the initial condition read , respectively , @xmath4 where the matrix hamiltonian is a point - dependent linear combination of the pauli matrices , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath7 is the neutrino energy , @xmath8 is the difference between neutrino masses squared , and @xmath9 is the wolfenstein potential , which is proportional to the electron density in the medium @xmath10 and the fermi constant @xmath11 .",
    "the constant coefficient @xmath12 is the reciprocal vacuum neutrino oscillation length , up to the factor of @xmath13 , @xmath14    equation defines a one - parametric subgroup of @xmath15 and hence of @xmath16 , the translation along @xmath3 being the group operation . in this sense , equation is analogous to the bargmann ",
    "telegdi equation @xcite in the spinor representation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the solution of the matrix linear ordinary differential equation , such as , can be represented as a time - ordered exponential ( dyson expansion ) @xcite . however , in the case of general @xmath17 profile , the solution in terms of an analytical function of the matrix argument ( i.e. , without a symbolic operation such as time ordering ) appears to be too challenging to find . in the recent investigations ,",
    "considerable progress was made in finding exact solutions of eq .   in certain special cases @xcite ; nevertheless , the general approach to this kind of equation still remains to be approximate .",
    "it was first naturally accepted that numerical simulations could give exhaustive results here and , in a sense , resolve the analytical difficulties that arise in the context of such equations .",
    "for instance , a numerical approach was employed in @xcite to find the domains in the neutrino mixing parameter space where the day - night asymmetry should be potentially observable .",
    "however , as mentioned above , estimations obtained with numerical techniques are not always reliable enough . in particular , in the large-@xmath8 regime , which has now proved to be realistic @xcite ,",
    "the oscillation length becomes small , and numerical evaluation of rapidly oscillating solutions introduces large uncertainties . the numerical time averaging of the flavor observation rates also becomes inaccurate in this regime .",
    "this effect is especially strong for low - energy neutrinos , including beryllium neutrinos ; probably , due to this fact , the large-@xmath8 and low - energy area was not covered by original numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , obtaining stringent constraints on the day - night asymmetry factor for the continuous measurement of small - length neutrino oscillations favors the analytical approach .",
    "quite a large number of publications are devoted to the analysis of such approximate analytical solutions .",
    "probably the most effective technique for finding the approximate solutions of matrix linear differential equations , such as , is the so - called magnus expansion @xcite , which is a generalization of the baker  campbell ",
    "hausdorff formula @xcite .",
    "this approach provides the solution up to any order of approximation , as well as the constraints on the remainder terms @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this technique @xcite , as well as other general methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , does not readily provide a way to find the solution in its explicit and practically usable form , not firmly fixing the earth model , namely , @xmath17 density distribution .",
    "it is thus desirable to find an approximate analytical solution of equation , which is valid under quite general assumptions about the electron density profile @xmath17 .",
    "this idea was developed in @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned earlier in this section , in our paper , we are not only aiming at finding the relevant approximate expressions , but also at analyzing their accuracy and applicability domain .",
    "namely , in section  [ sec : evolutionoperator ] , we find the approximate solutions for the flavor evolution matrix inside the earth , and then , in section  [ sec : dna ] , we arrive at the observation probabilities for the neutrinos of different flavors .",
    "these probabilities are finally subjected to the averaging procedure due to the continuous observation of the solar neutrinos throughout the year ( sec .",
    "[ sec : averaging ] ) , and the results of this averaging are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] . the magnitude of the day - night asymmetry appears to be sensitive to the non - trivial structure of the earth s crust under the neutrino detector , so the effect of the crust is paid special attention in section  [ sec : crusteffect ] .",
    "the uncertainties of our estimation are also discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , in the interesting cases of beryllium and boron neutrinos .",
    "we analyze the sources of such uncertainties and finally compare our results with the numerical simulation .",
    "the detailed derivation of the approximate solutions for the evolution operator is moved to the appendix to make the flow of the paper less complicated .",
    "in our investigation , we use the model electron density profile @xmath17 with @xmath18 narrow segments , where it changes steeply , separated by @xmath19 wide though sloping segments . let us call these segments cliffs and valleys , respectively .",
    "let the cliffs be localized near points @xmath20 , @xmath21 , namely , occupy segments @xmath22 $ ] of widths @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . then the valleys are @xmath25 $ ] and have the widths @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , this kind of model is a good approximation for the earth s density profile known in geophysics , where it corresponds to the so - called preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite . in the present section",
    ", we will assume that the above segments can be chosen in such a way that the inequality @xmath27 takes place , i.e. the cliffs are narrow and the valleys are wide compared with the oscillation length . in the following , we will briefly call such density distribution piecewise continuous .    let us note in advance ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] for details ) that for the energies of beryllium neutrinos ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and , to some extent , boron neutrinos ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , the earth s layers can be divided into cliffs and valleys satisfying , as well as into a number of layers whose widths are of the order of the oscillation length , while the density variations are small .",
    "one can show that the contributions of the latter segments can be easily considered in a manner very similar to those of the cliffs , hence we do not consider them until sec .",
    "[ sec : crusteffect ] where they will be paid special attention . in the present section , it is enough to note that the valley - cliff classification depends on the neutrino energy .",
    "it is also worth saying here that during the night , the neutrino ray traverses different paths through the earth , thus , the lengths @xmath23 and @xmath32 vary . however , assumption holds for the most part of the night .",
    "the total flavor evolution operator for our piecewise continuous density profile equals the matrix product of the evolution operators for all cliffs and valleys . within each of these segments ,",
    "the two small parameters arise : the first of them , @xmath33 due to the relatively small density of the earth @xcite , while the second parameter due to the piecewise continuous structure of the density profile , @xmath34 the smallness of parameter @xmath35 will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    the evolution matrix for each segment , as well as the total evolution matrix , can be subjected to the following unitary transformations @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the corresponding phase incursion . for the calculations which follow",
    ", it is also useful to introduce the effective mixing angle in the medium @xmath39 $ ]  @xcite , which is defined by the expressions @xmath40 in terms of this angle , @xmath41    the transformation with matrices @xmath42 locally diagonalizes the hamiltonian @xmath43 in the point @xmath3 .",
    "it thus makes the complete diagonalization in the homogeneous case @xmath44 @xcite . the transformation with the operator @xmath45 isolates the effect of the medium inhomogeneity , the transformed evolution matrix @xmath46 satisfying the equation @xmath47 where the dot over @xmath48 denotes the gradient @xmath49 due to the fact that the neutrino detector is homogeneous ( @xmath50 ) , eq .",
    "has a well - defined and physically relevant @xmath51 limit for any fixed @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , asymptotically convergent behavior of such systems of differential equations is stated by the levinson s theorem @xcite .    in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the equation above is trivial , @xmath52 .",
    "however , in the valley @xmath53 $ ] , the slow change of the density @xmath17 enables us to use the so - called adiabatic approximation leading to the same result @xcite @xmath54 where the remainder term is a ( generally speaking , non - diagonal ) matrix and @xmath55 is the variation of the density parameter @xmath56 over the valley . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wolfenstein potential undergoes a considerable change within the narrow cliff @xmath57 $ ] with the phase incursion @xmath58 , then we get @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the jump of the effective mixing angle on the @xmath61th cliff .",
    "moreover , one can show that within the more accurate @xmath62 approximation , the above expressions take the form ( see the appendix ) @xmath63\\right\\ } + { \\mathit{o}}({{\\scriptstyle\\delta}}\\eta \\ \\delta^2 ) \\quad                                                                     \\text{(valley ) } ,     \\\\",
    "r_0(x_j^+ , x_j^- ) & = & \\exp\\ { ( -{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_2{{\\scriptstyle\\delta}}\\theta_j + { \\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_1\\mu_j ) e^{2{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma_3\\psi(x_j^-)}\\ } + { \\mathit{o}}(\\eta\\delta^2 )     \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad     \\text{(cliff ) } \\label{eq7},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 now let us write the evolution operator for the whole neutrino path .",
    "the neutrinos observed during the day are created in the point @xmath2 inside the solar core , then travel to the earth , enter the detector in the point @xmath65 and are finally absorbed in the point @xmath66 inside it . in the nighttime , however , after reaching the earth in the point @xmath65 , the neutrinos pass through a number of earth s layers ( valleys ) discussed above , and only after that they enter the detector in the point @xmath67 and are absorbed in @xmath66 . crossing the sun - to - vacuum interface , as well as traveling inside the sun , does not involve steep electron density changes , moreover , the neutrino propagation is highly adiabatic there ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) , thus we can treat the whole segment @xmath68 $ ] as a single valley and use the adiabatic approximation . as it was mentioned earlier , the flavor evolution operator for the whole neutrino path is a matrix product of the evolution operators for each segment ( each valley and cliff ) . by the substitution of the approximate solutions and into representation , after some transformations we find the total evolution operator in the form ( compare with eq .  ) @xmath69 here , the subscript ` sun ' refers to the point @xmath2 inside the solar core , where the neutrino is created , and the evolution operator inside the neutrino detector is denoted @xmath70 .",
    "the factor @xmath19 in the remainder term indicates that it contains the sum over all cliffs and valleys .",
    "moreover , we use the following notation : @xmath71 it is also convenient to append definition with @xmath72 if the boundary between the earth s crust and the detector is abrupt , @xmath73 , then @xmath74 vanishes .",
    "quite analogously , @xmath75 vanishes for the abrupt vacuum - to - earth boundary .    by projecting the neutrino state onto the flavor eigenstates ,",
    "we arrive at the observation probabilities for the electron / muon neutrino @xmath76 where , for nighttime neutrinos , @xmath77 while for daytime neutrinos we have @xmath78 the mixing angle immediately before the detector obviously takes the vacuum value @xmath6 in this case . due to the homogeneity of the detector substance and its smallness compared with the oscillation length , we easily find @xmath79 where the small parameter @xmath80 is the ratio of the detector width @xmath81 to the oscillation length @xmath82 .",
    "the quadratic remainder terms can obviously be neglected .",
    "in order to evaluate the probabilities obtained above , let us first make the averaging over the phase @xmath83 , which corresponds to the neutrino path between the creation point @xmath2 and the earth .",
    "the region of the neutrino creation is extremely large compared with the oscillation length , thus , after this averaging , @xmath84 with a high accuracy . using this fact together with eq .  ,",
    "after averaging we find @xmath85 the latter expression constitutes the famous result of mikheev and smirnov @xcite . on the other hand , after averaging over @xmath83 for the nighttime neutrinos , we obtain @xmath86 where we have made use of the fact that matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 commute up to a negligible term of the order @xmath89 .    for the calculations which follow , we will use the smallness of the jumps @xmath90 and the parameters @xmath91 . within the linear approximation in the earth s density parameter @xmath56 , this leads to @xmath92 partial derivatives with respect to the small parameters",
    "are @xmath93 in the above expressions , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the distance between the boundary of the @xmath61th crossed earth s shell and the detector , measured along the neutrino ray . finally , by substituting the derivatives and into eq .   and using the fact that @xmath96 , we arrive at the final result @xmath97 which is valid up to the terms of the order @xmath98 and quadratic terms @xmath99 .",
    "the term including the product of the detector width @xmath100 and the oscillating factor @xmath101 is of the order @xmath102 and is thus omitted .",
    "the above expression provides a generalization of the main result of paper @xcite for the case of nonzero - thickness cliffs and detector .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that eq .",
    "gives poor information on the effects to be measured .",
    "indeed , the neutrino experiments last for years , and thus , eq .   may only acquire a predictive power after some kind of averaging .",
    "the averaging procedure should take into account the axial rotation of the earth ( involving the integration over the nights ) , as well as its orbital motion around the sun .",
    "the averaging procedure can be performed analytically , if the oscillation phase incursions @xmath103 vary by much more than @xmath104 during the night .",
    "namely , in this case , one can employ the stationary phase technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of the beryllium neutrinos ( @xmath105  mev ) traveling through the earth , the oscillation length is about 30 km , while the depths of the valleys @xmath106 vary by many hundreds of kilometers , so the oscillation phase variations are indeed large enough to use the stationary phase approximation . to some extent ,",
    "the same holds for boron neutrinos .",
    "however , for both neutrino types , there are layers , to which the stationary phase approximation may not apply .",
    "these are the earth s crust immediately under the detector and ( for boron neutrinos ) the upper mantle .",
    "these layers are discussed in detail in section  [ sec : crusteffect ] and appendix  [ app : crust ] and do not interfere with the picture described in this paragraph .     inside the earth and the neutrino path through it .",
    "the figure demonstrates the cross section of the earth which contains the nadir @xmath107 , the center of the earth @xmath108 , and the neutrino ray , width=453 ]    let us consider a neutrino traveling through the earth , which , according to the prem model @xcite , consists of a number of concentric spherical shells .",
    "the boundary between the valleys @xmath109 corresponds to the point where the neutrino crosses one of the interfaces between the earth s shells ; let @xmath110 be the radius of this interface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : earthdensity ] ) .",
    "further , the distances @xmath111 between the detector and the points where the neutrino enters / leaves the interface with radius @xmath110 are functions of the ` nadir angle ' @xmath112 $ ] defined as the angle between the direction to the sun and the nadir in the point of the detector . in terms of the solar elevation angle @xmath113 @xcite",
    ", the nadir angle is @xmath114 .",
    "the nadir angle , in turn , is a function of the earth s axial rotation angle @xmath115 ( ` time of day ' ) and the orbital motion angle @xmath116 ( ` season ' ) .",
    "the dependence of the distances on the nadir angle is easily found to be @xmath117 where the upper / lower signs in correspond to the neutrino entering / leaving the interface @xmath110 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : earthdensity ] ) .",
    "the inequality ensures that the intersection of the neutrino ray with this interface exists .    in order to find the night average of the electron / muon neutrino observation probabilities ,",
    "let us note some properties of expressions and .",
    "first , the number of interfaces crossed by the neutrino is defined via the inequality , so the number of the valleys and , thus , the number of terms entering the sums in are changing during the night .",
    "therefore , the night average of eq .",
    "contains the sum over all interfaces @xmath61 , with the average of the @xmath61th oscillating term involving @xmath103 defined as follows : @xmath118 here , @xmath119 is some slowly changing function of the nadir angle and @xmath120 is the total duration of the night in terms of the earth s axial rotation angle @xmath121 , namely , the length of the segment where @xmath122 ( the sun is below the horizon ) .",
    "second , the duration of the night is , in turn , a function of the season @xmath123 . on the equinox , e.g. , @xmath124 , while on the winter solstice , @xmath125 .",
    "however , the summer nights are just as long as the opposite winter days , so that @xmath126 and the total duration of the nights over all the year is exactly half the year .",
    "therefore , the averaging over the year of @xmath127 days should involve the division by the total duration of the nights , i.e. , @xmath128 . for @xmath129 , the summation over the nights",
    "can be replaced by the integration , @xmath130 and the averaging formula for the terms containing the phase incursion @xmath103 takes the form @xmath131    now we are able to apply the stationary phase technique to such an integral containing the rapidly oscillating exponential .",
    "indeed , let us use the expression , which is valid for smooth functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 defined on segment @xmath134 $ ] containing a single non - degenerate stationary point @xmath135 such that @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xcite @xmath138 the two leading terms come from the stationary point and the boundary , respectively .",
    "however , in the application to the integral , the boundary term vanishes .",
    "indeed , the boundary of the integration domain corresponds to the neutrino ray being tangent to the interface with radius @xmath110 , hence , @xmath139 , and the boundary term is absent . on the other hand , the stationary point is obviously achieved at midnight , when the nadir angle @xmath140 ( the sun is in its lowest position ) , so the integration over the night yields @xmath141 where the two possible signs before @xmath142 correspond to @xmath143 ( see eq .  ) .",

    "thus , for boron neutrinos , the error of the linear approximation is within @xmath218 .",
    "further , the error due to the finite width of the @xmath61th valley is estimated as @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the density variation on the @xmath61th valley and @xmath32 is the width of the valley . on the other hand , if the width of the @xmath221th cliff @xmath222 , the resulting error is @xmath223 . within the prem model ,",
    "the cliffs are abrupt ( @xmath224 ) , so we will not discuss the numerical values of the corresponding errors .    if there are deep layers in the prem density distribution , whose widths are of the order of the oscillation length , they can be considered neither valleys nor cliffs . however ,",

    "these contributions have the relative magnitude @xmath228 compared with the leading term  ( see eqs .   and ) .",
    "this suppression is quite strong for dense though deep inner earth s shells , including its core .    finally , for the layers which lie within @xmath229 under the detector and have the widths comparable with the oscillation length",
    ", the averaging procedure can not be performed so as to result in the expression . here",
    ", we are only able to follow the approach of sec .  , which results in an unaveraged correction . the latter correction , in principle ,",

    "the strict constraint on the uncertainty introduced by neglecting the effect of this structure is given in eq .  .",

    "is principally determined by the mean electron density of the earth within @xmath280 oscillation lengths under the neutrino detector , i.e. in the earth s crust for beryllium neutrinos , as well as in the upper mantle for boron neutrinos .",

    "[ fig : adn_e]b , one may notice that high - energy neutrinos , as it was expected , ` sense ' the deeper earth s layers .",

    "such an accuracy of the day - night effect measurements is yet to be achieved in the future experiments , such as lena @xcite .",
    "further , the theoretical analysis predicts next - to - leading - order corrections to the day - night effect , which may arise due to the stationary phase points during the year , at which the nighttime neutrino oscillation phase freezes .",
    "these points occur on the winter and the summer solstices and are spectacular for the fact that their contributions do not vanish after ( arbitrarily ) long observations .",

    "it is also worth mentioning that the good agreement of our analytical predictions with the numerical simulations in a surprisingly wide range of neutrino energies ( i.e. oscillation lengths ) is also a byproduct of a number of specific features of the actual earth s density profile .",
    "for instance , the large density jumps are lying very deep inside the earth ; the crust is quite thin ( and , as mentioned , is not a cliff for beryllium neutrinos ) , however , its density is quite low ; the layers widths are incomparable , etc .",

    "@xmath56 and @xmath35 , we have @xmath320 then , using expansion , we find the immediate expression for the evolution operator for the crust : @xmath321 where real numbers @xmath322 are defined by the expression @xmath323 note that the form of this approximation coincides with the cliff approximation , up to the coefficient substitution @xmath324 , @xmath325 . in particular , the cliff approximation is restored in the @xmath326 limit .    99 l.  wolfenstein , phys",
