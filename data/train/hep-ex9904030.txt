    "h1 have measured the triple - differential cross - section , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the mean @xmath4 of the two highest @xmath4 jets ) in the @xmath5 center - of - mass system ( hadronic cms )  @xcite .",
    "the photon virtuality spans the range @xmath6 and @xmath7 is constrained to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the four - vectors of the proton , virtual photon , and electron .",
    "the momentum fraction of the parton from the photon entering the hard scattering , @xmath12 , defined as @xmath13 is estimated from the two highest @xmath4 jets .",
    "the variable @xmath14 defines the hadronic cms energy . , where @xmath15 is the four - vector of the incoming parton from the photon .",
    "this definition assumes a collinear emission of the parton from the photon , which is an approximation neglecting some @xmath16 contribution due to the finite @xmath1 .",
    "these contributions are , however , small for moderate @xmath1 .",
    "this variable differs from that defined in ( [ xgam ] ) . when comparing with qcd calculations at lo level , partons directly give jets and there are exactly two partons in the final state .",
    "thus , @xmath17 .",
    "however , in nlo , @xmath18 still gives the momentum fraction of the parton in the photon , but @xmath19 . at nlo",
    ", one also has contributions to @xmath20 from the direct contribution , whereas at lo @xmath21 for the direct process . ]",
    "the triple differential cross - section is shown in figure  [ figure4 ]    as a function of @xmath12 in ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the data ( points ) are corrected for detector effects and the error bar shows the quadratic sum of systematic and statistical errors .",
    "the cross section decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath3 and with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "hadronization corrections are not included in the data .",
    "these are believed to be small on average but will presumably change the shape of the @xmath12 distribution .",
    "qcd calculations of dijet cross - sections with virtual photons have recently been performed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations are implemented in the fixed order program jetvip @xcite . in nlo",
    ", in the direct component a logarithm @xmath22 occurs , which is proportional to the photon splitting function .",
    "this term is large for @xmath23 and therefore subtracted and resummed in the virtual photon structure function .",
    "the condition @xmath23 ensures that it is possible to resolve an internal structure of the virtual photon .",
    "the virtual photon pdf s are suppressed as @xmath24 and various anztze have been used to interpolate between the regions of known leading - log behaviour  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the logarithmic term is only subtracted for the transversely polarized photons , since it vanishes in the case of longitudinally polarized photons for @xmath25 .",
    "the hadronic content of longitudinal virtual photons should be very small and therefore negligible .",
    "the results of the nlo calculations are also shown in figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "the direct component of this model is shown as the shaded histogram .",
    "the result including a resolved component in nlo is shown as the full line .",
    "the calculation including a resolved photon component compares better to the data and indicates a need for a resolved virtual photon component below @xmath26  gev@xmath27 , especially in the forward rapidity region , corresponding to low @xmath12 .",
    "the discrepancy of data and nlo calculation for @xmath28 will presumably be cured when hadronization effects are considered , which lower the nlo results at large @xmath12 .",
    "h1 have used their studies to extract an effective parton denstity ( epdf ) of the virtual photon . by using the single effective subprocess approximation  @xcite , the cross - section for dijet production in lo",
    "can be written @xmath29 here the effective parton densities ( epdf ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are defined as @xmath32 the epdf is shown in figure  [ figure6 ] .",
    "we see that , independently of @xmath1 , the parton density tends to be flat or rising with @xmath33 ( not to be confused with @xmath12 ) .",
    "this behaviour is maintained as the probing scale increases .",
    "these are features characteristic of photon structure .",
    "the data are compared with predictions from the sas  @xcite and dg  @xcite models which are able to describe the data quite well except where @xmath34 and various aspects of the model start to break down .",
    "the models tend to underestimate the data in these regions .",
    "the three parameterisations for the parton density all give a good description of the data both in the lowest @xmath33 range and in the lowest two @xmath1 bins but predict a more rapid suppression as @xmath35 than is seen in the data .",
    "zeus has measured the high - mass three - jet cross section in photoproduction , @xmath36 , as shown in figure  [ m3j ]  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37  pqcd calculations from two groups of authors  @xcite provide a good description of the data , even though they are leading order for this process .",
    "monte carlo models also generate three - jet events through the parton shower mechanism and both pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite reproduce the shape of the @xmath38 distribution .    for three - jet events",
    "there are two relevant scattering angles as illustrated in figure  [ angles](a ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in figure  [ angles](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the @xmath39 distribution resembles that of @xmath41 in dijet production  @xcite and exhibits forward and backward peaks .",
    "it is well described in both @xmath37  pqcd calculations and parton shower models .",
    "the @xmath40 distribution is peaked near 0 and @xmath42 indicating that the three - jet plane tends to lie near the plane containing the highest energy jet and the beam .",
    "this is particularly evident if one considers the @xmath40 distribution for three partons uniformly distributed in the available phase space .",
    "the phase space near @xmath43 and @xmath42 has been depleted by the @xmath44 cuts and by the jet - finding algorithm .",
    "the pqcd calculations describe perfectly the @xmath40 distribution .",
    "it is remarkable that the parton shower models pythia and herwig are also able to reproduce the @xmath40 distribution .    within the parton - shower model",
    "it is possible to determine the contribution to three - jet production from initial - state radiation ( isr ) and final - state radiation .",
    "it is also possible to switch the qcd phenomenon of colour coherence on and off . from a monte carlo",
    "study it has been determined that isr is predominantly responsible for three - jet production . also , it has been found that colour coherence can account for the suppression of large angle emissions which leads to the depletion of the @xmath40 distribution near @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the dijet cross section at low @xmath1 has been measured by the h1 collaboration and compared to nlo qcd calculations .",
    "the comparison shows a clear need for resolved virtual photon component .",
    "first measurements of a leading order effective virtual photon pdf have been made .",
    "existing models for virtual photon pdf s are consistent with the measurements but systematic errors are still large .    a first measurement of high transverse energy three - jet photoproduction has been performed .",
    "the distribution of the three jets is sensitive to colour coherence and is correctly predicted in @xmath37  pqcd ."
