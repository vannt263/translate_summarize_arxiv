    "+ the following theorem states , informally speaking , that a point configuration which does not allow one to apply the `` cheap argument '' must necessarily have a small combinatorial complexity , and consequently must have a large discrepancy .",
    "in other words , either the cheap argument is applicable straightforward or the point configuration must have even larger discrepancy especially because it prohibits the application of the cheap argument . in the statement of the theorem , as the `` right upper '' boundary of an anchored axis - parallel box @xmath37 $ ] we mean the union of all those @xmath38-dimensional faces of @xmath10 which are adjacent to the ( `` right upper '' ) point @xmath39 .",

    "then @xmath42    we finish the introduction with a discussion on the applicability of the `` cheap proof '' and on the combinatorial complexity of point sets .",

    "the point set ( a ) on the left - hand side is extremal in the sense that it prohibits the application of the `` cheap argument ''  there is no anchored axis - parallel box which has two elements of the point set on its right - upper boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "the point set ( a ) has very low complexity in the sense of vc theory : there are 9 points , and the cardinality of is obviously 10 ( note that the empty set also counts ) , which is smallest possible ( unless we allow points to coincide ) . in contrast , for the point set ( b ) the cardinality of can be calculated to be 46 , which is @xmath46 and thus by is largest possible . on the other hand ,",

    "this proves theorem [ th1 ] ( with the value @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 for the constant ) in the case @xmath47 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th1 ] in the general case uses the same idea as the proof in the previous section ; however , it requires a slightly more complicated combinatorial argument .",
    "the reason why the argument from the previous section fails is that the last inequality of is no longer true , so that we can no longer guarantee that every box of the type @xmath60 contains a point .",
    "consequently we will use a slightly different construction , and distinguish between several cases .",
    "+ as the reader will see our proof contains several numerical parameters , such as the number 25 in the definition of @xmath68 below .",
    "of course we have chosen parameters which give a reasonable result . however , optimizing these parameter is fairly complicated , and we do not claim that we have found the optimal ones . also , with this method there is a trade - off between the two constants appearing in the statement of the theorem , which are 1/6 and 250 in our formulation of theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "decreasing one of them would possibly increase the other , and vice versa .",
    "in particular , we checked that the theorem also holds with constants 1/10 and 40 .",

    "the trivial bound @xmath72 from the one - dimensional case already proves the theorem in the case @xmath73 .",
    "so we may and do assume that @xmath74 .",
    "we will need the reverse bernoulli - type inequality @xmath75 this inequality can be easily checked numerically and , what is more tedious , can be proved by elementary analysis .",
