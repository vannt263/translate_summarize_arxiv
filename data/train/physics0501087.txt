    "a practical matter , land surface temperature ( lst ) estimates retrieved from radiances reported by a remote sensor will be subject to some unavoidable level of calibration error , which need not be very accurately known .",
    "while all forms of quantitative exploitation of radiometric data in remote sensing are afflicted to some degree by calibration error effects , this problem may be a special concern for the bayesian multiband lst algorithm  @xcite .",
    "that is because the bayesian algorithm iterates on a range of plausible surface temperatures , within which the estimated lst value is obtained as an expected value .",
    "should uncompensated calibration errors lead to a temperature interval which does not bracket the true surface temperature , the algorithm in its present form has no way to recover , and may return a surface temperature estimate with degraded accuracy .",
    "this note sketches the extension of the bayesian approach to lst retrieval to include effects of a simple form of unknown calibration error . after a review of the bayesian approach to lst retrieval",
    ", the calibration error is parameterized as linear in the true aperture radiance .",
    "the joint prior probalility for the calibration error parameters is then obtained by imposing the requirement that two distinct observers agree on its mathematical form .",
    "finally , the bayesian lst estimator is extended to include linear calibration error by treating the calibration error parameters as nuisance variables , and integrating them out of the final estimators for surface temperature and emissivity .",
    "the bayesian land surface temperature retrieval algorithm is developed in  @xcite , which may be consulted for details .",
    "the approach to lst retrieval presented in that earlier paper consists of three elements :    \\1 .",
    "the forward model for sensor aperture radiance , assumed linear in surface emissivity : @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the upwelling diffuse radiance at nadir optical depth @xmath3 ( top of the atmosphere , or toa , for spaceborne sensors ; @xmath4 is the cosine of the angle with respect to zenith ) and the downwelling irradiance at the surface , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the planck function at surface temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the emissivity is @xmath7 , and the surface reflectance @xmath8 .",
    "note that ( [ eqn2 ] ) assumes khirchoff s law ; this is done solely for simplicity .",
    "it is also assumed ( at least initially ) that the sensor has high spectral resolution .",
    "the maxent form of the conditional probability of observing radiance @xmath9  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite in the presence of noise - equivalent radiance @xmath10 : @xmath11\\frac{di}{\\sigma } \\label{eqn7}\\ ] ]    \\3 .",
    "the prior probability of surface temperature and emissivity  @xcite : @xmath12    the posterior probability for the surface temperature and emissivity , given observed radiance and available knowledge , is obtained from these quantities by use of bayes theorem : @xmath13",
    "by hypothesis , the physical radiance @xmath14 at wavenumber @xmath15 is related linearly to the reported radiance @xmath9 : @xmath16 both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed to be small quantities ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 it is the physical radiance @xmath14 which goes into ( [ eqn2 ] ) . recalling that the forward model ( [ eqn2 ] ) is linear in @xmath21 , the exponent in that expression is @xmath22 which is quadratic in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 .",
    "in order to obtain a useable estimator , it is necessary to find the prior probability for the calibration error parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . as in  @xcite",
    ", two equally cogent observers must relate their descriptions of radiance , and of calibration error , by a lorentz transformation  @xcite,@xcite connecting one ( primed ) coordinate description moving with velocity @xmath23 along the observation axis with respect to the other ( unprimed ) one by @xmath24 where the doppler factor @xmath25 is given in terms of the boost parameter @xmath26 by @xmath27 the quantity @xmath25 is real and nonvanishing for physical lorentz transformations .",
    "let @xmath28 be the prior probability assigned by vladimir in the unprimed frame , and @xmath29 be that assigned by estragon , viewing radiance in the primed frame .",
    "the prior probabilities in the two frames are related by @xmath30 where @xmath31 \\label{eqn14}\\ ] ] is the jacobian determinant for the transformation .",
    "consider first @xmath17 as defined by vladimir .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 ; then by the lorentz invariance properties of spectral radiance  @xcite we have @xmath33 and also @xmath34 if vladimir and estragon are to agree that the quantity @xmath35 admits interpretation as a radiance .",
    "the ratio @xmath36 is likewise invariant , so that @xmath37 as it must be , as the ratio of two radiances evaluated in the same lorentz frame .",
    "thus @xmath38    next consider @xmath18 .",
    "we have @xmath39 from which @xmath40 as must be for any radiance , in particular a noise radiance . by ( [ eqn19 ] )",
    "we find @xmath41    the jacobian is therefore @xmath42=\\eta^3\\ ] ] so vladimir and estragon must agree that @xmath43 and , by the principle of indifference  @xcite,@xcite , that @xmath44 with solution @xmath45    application of bayes theorem ( [ eqn3 ] ) , as in  @xcite , immediately gives the result that the joint posterior probability of @xmath6 , @xmath21 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is proportional to the product of ( [ eqn7 ] ) , ( [ eqn45 ] ) , and ( [ prior ] ) : @xmath46   d\\epsilon \\frac{dt}{t } d\\alpha \\frac{d\\beta}{\\beta } \\frac{di}{\\sigma}. \\label{drumroll}\\ ] ]",
    "estimators for @xmath6 and @xmath21 may be constructed from ( [ drumroll ] ) as expectation values in exactly the same manner as in  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of spectral quantities integrated over a passband follows the equivalent discussion in  @xcite . in practice , ( [ drumroll ] ) will be unaltered for band - integrated radiances .",
    "the calibration error parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are treated as nuisance parameters : one does not care what their actual values are , so long as they lie between specified limits .",
    "one is therfore at liberty to integrate ( [ drumroll ] ) over those limits and obtain estimators for @xmath47 and @xmath48 in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 in ( [ eqn61 ] ) and ( [ eqn63 ] ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 have no dependence on exactly what the calibration error parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 were , for a given reported sensor aperture radiance .",
    "it does not appear feasible to integrate moments of ( [ drumroll ] ) in closed form .",
    "however , by integrating over @xmath21 first , it is possible to take advantage of the closed - form result for the lst posterior probability derived in  @xcite : @xmath53 } { 2\\sigma^{2 } } \\right ] h(\\epsilon_{max},\\epsilon_{min } ) \\ !",

    "this is potentially awkward for routine evaluation , but the computational burden can be alleviated in special cases :        \\3 . once a value for @xmath51 is obtained for one pixel in a dataset , expectation values @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be calculated and used in estimation of @xmath51 for other pixels .",
    "should calibration error be slowly varying , estimates of @xmath64 and @xmath65 obtained from one dataset could be used for subsequent ones , or as initial guesses for updated estimates of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
