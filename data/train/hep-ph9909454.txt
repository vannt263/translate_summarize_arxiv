    "string theory indicates the existence of extra dimensions beyond our usual four dimensional spacetime .",
    "these extra dimensions must be compactified by small radii in order not to be observed .",
    "however , these radii do not have to be close to the planck length , but have only to satisfy the constraint from the gravity experiment , i.e. , they should be shorter than @xmath2 range .",
    "the relation between the fundamental scale @xmath3 and the observed planck scale @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a volume of the extra space , and @xmath7 is the number of the extra dimensions . if @xmath3 is set to tev scale , @xmath7 must be greater than one , otherwise the gravity would change over the scale of the solar system from the observed one .    for simplicity , we assume that the shape of the extra space is torus , in which case @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radius of the @xmath10-th extra dimension . hence , @xmath11    we can see from eq.([rlt - pf ] ) that @xmath3 can be lowered from @xmath4 to tev scale by taking the radii @xmath9 to be large compared to the planck length . in this way , we can solve the hierarchy problem without supersymmetry ( susy ) or technicolor @xcite .",
    "we can take the standard model ( sm ) fields for either bulk fields or boundary fields , which are confined to the d - branes or domain walls . in the case that the sm fields feel some extra dimensions , their compactification scale must be larger than a few hundred gev because corresponding kaluza - klein ( k.k . )",
    "modes have never been observed yet @xcite .",
    "it is possible to realize the hierarchy among the fermion masses by using the ratio of the volume of the region in which the bulk fields spread out to that of the boundary fields @xcite .",
    "cp is a very good symmetry , but it is violated in the @xmath12-@xmath13 system by a small amount ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there are two possibilities for the origin of the cp violation .",
    "one is the explicit cp violation , and the other is the spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) . in string theory , cp is a gauge symmetry @xcite , so it must be spontaneously broken .",
    "if this cp breaking scale is low enough , one finds that cp is violated spontaneously in an effective field theory at low energy .",
    "we shall consider this case here .",
    "in this paper we shall assume that different fields feel different numbers of extra dimensions , as discussed in ref.@xcite , and show in the context of large extra dimensions enough cp violation can be obtained from the spontaneous breaking in a simple non - susy model , which is usually considered not to cause the scpv .    in section [ model ]",
    ", we shall explain our model and realize the hierarchy among the fermion masses . in section [ cp ]",
    ", we shall estimate @xmath0 in our model and show that it is consistent with the observed value . in section [ neutrino ] , the neutrino masses and mixing angles",
    "are derived without a help of intermediate scale , and in section [ strong - cp ] we shall try to apply the axion scenario to our context . finally , section [ conclusions ] contains some conclusions .",
    "basically , we shall consider the minimal standard model with an additional gauge - singlet scalar field , but we shall assume that different fields feel different numbers of extra dimensions .",
    "the relevant interactions are as follows .    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath10-th generation of the left - handed quark doublet , right - handed up - type quark singlet and right - handed down - type quark singlet , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the @xmath10-th generation of the left - handed lepton doublet and right - handed charged lepton singlet . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the doublet and singlet higgs fields respectively , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the yukawa coupling constants and @xmath25 are dimensionful coupling constants .    note that the non - renormalizable terms in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ l - int ] ) should be considered because the fundamental scale @xmath3 is relatively low in our scenario .",
    "we assume the cp - invariance for the lagrangian , so that all parameters in eq .",
    "( [ l - int ] ) are real .",
    "we will explore the possibility that the cp - invariance is broken spontaneously at the weak scale due to the complex vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs fields .",
    "the numbers of the extra dimensions that each field can feel are listed in table  [ nb - exdim ] .",
    ".the number of the extra dimensions that each field can feel .",
    "@xmath26 are gauge fields . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the radii of these extra dimensions",
    "are supposed to be the same size and it is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "let us denote @xmath28 as a five dimensional bulk field , where @xmath29 represents the coordinate of the fifth dimension compactified by a radius @xmath30 .",
    "if we fourier expand @xmath31 then we can regard @xmath32 as a four dimensional field corresponding to the @xmath33-th k.k . mode",
    ".    on the other hand , the boundary fields are localized at the four dimensional wall whose thickness is of order @xmath34 , so a coupling including at least one boundary field is suppressed by a factor @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a number of bulk fields included in the coupling @xcite .",
    "generalization to our six dimensional case is trivial .",
    "the existence of infinite k.k .",
    "modes change the running of the gauge coupling constants above the compactification scale @xmath38 to the power - law running @xcite .",
    "so , it seems natural that a new physics like the gut appears up to one order above the scale @xmath38 by considering the runnings of the gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "we shall denote the scale that the new physics appears as @xmath39 .",
    "now let us assume that coupling constants @xmath23 , @xmath25 are generated at the scale @xmath39 , then it seems natural that they are of the form as @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the six dimensional bulk spacetime , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are dimensionless couplings .    in this case",
    "the four dimensional couplings @xmath23 and @xmath25 are of the form as @xmath44    here we have assumed @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , setting @xmath47 to be @xmath48 , the desired hierarchy among quark and lepton masses and mixing angles are obtained . and",
    "@xmath49 , the power - law running of the yukawa couplings does not destroy the structure represented by eq.([yukawa ] ) .",
    "] for example , if we assume @xmath50  gev , we should set @xmath51  tev .",
    "we shall take these values in the following , and further we shall assume @xmath52  tev .",
    "cp invariance is broken at the weak scale due to the complex vevs of the neutral higgs fields .",
    "these vevs are parametrized as @xmath53 where @xmath54  gev , and we have removed the phase of the @xmath55 by using the @xmath56 gauge symmetry . here note that our scenario does not depend on the higgs potential , so we shall assume the potential to have a cp violating minimum .",
    "then the quark mass matrices at low energy are obtained as @xmath57    we can see from eq.([yukawa ] ) that @xmath58 and @xmath59 have complex phases of order @xmath60 , so each element of the ckm matrix also has an @xmath61 phase .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath62  gev .",
    "next we expand the neutral higgs fields around their vevs as follows .",
    "@xmath63 where we have chosen the unitary gauge . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are cp - even real scalar fields , and @xmath66 is a cp - odd one .    in terms of these fields ,",
    "renormalizable yukawa coupling terms below the weak scale are @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the mass eigenstates of quarks , and @xmath71 is the mass eigenvalue corresponding to the state @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath73 and @xmath74 have @xmath61 phases , where @xmath75 is the @xmath76-matrix in the basis of the quark mass eigenstates .",
    "now we shall estimate @xmath0 in the @xmath12-@xmath13 system .",
    "the cp violation parameter @xmath0 can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the neutral kaon mass matrix in the @xmath79 basis .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath80 comes from the standard box diagram depicted in fig.[box - dgm ] .",
    "this diagram is estimated as @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the masses of the c quark , w boson and the kaon respectively , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the fermi constant and the fine structure constant .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 are the weinberg angle and the cabibbo angle respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the dominant contribution to @xmath89 comes from the tree - level diagram shown by fig.[higgs - exchg ] , because the box diagram mentioned above is real up to the phase of order @xmath90 and can not be the leading contribution .",
    "this contribution is calculated by @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the mass of the singlet higgs field .    according to ref.@xcite",
    ", @xmath93 then @xmath94 here we have assumed @xmath95 gev .",
    "together with the fact that @xmath96 , @xmath97",
    "in our scenario , the fundamental scale @xmath3 is of order tev scale , so at first sight it does not seem that the see - saw mechanism , which requires an intermediate scale around @xmath98 gev , can be applied .",
    "however , by using the volume factor suppression mentioned in section .",
    "[ ferm - hiechy ] we can realize the small masses of the neutrinos .    we shall introduce a new extra dimension and denote its radius as @xmath99 . let the right - handed neutrinos @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) feel this new extra dimension , so that neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath102 are suppressed by a large volume factor @xmath103 and the dirac masses of neutrinos can become small enough @xcite",
    ".    denote the majorana mass scale of the right - handed neutrino as @xmath104 , then according to the see - saw mechanism left - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath105 is calculated as , @xmath106 where @xmath54 gev .",
    "this realizes the large mixing between @xmath107-@xmath108 expected from the atmospheric neutrino and the small mixing between @xmath109-@xmath107 expected from the small angle msw solution simultaneously @xcite .",
    "for example , if we assume @xmath110 , we should set @xmath111  kev in order to obtain @xmath112  ev .    we shall list some notable comments .    first",
    ", if we try to suppress @xmath105 only by the volume factor without the see - saw mechanism , then @xmath99 becomes so large that the extra dimension will be observed by the gravity experiment .",
    "thus we must either use the see - saw mechanism or let @xmath100 feel more than one extra dimensions in order to realize the experimentally accepted small masses of the neutrinos without contradiction to the gravity experiments .",
    "second , the effect of the running of @xmath102 between @xmath39 and @xmath113 is not expected to be very large by the same reason mentioned at the footnote in section.[ferm - hiechy ] .",
    "then we have neglected this running effect in the above discussion .",
    "finally , it is worthy to note that the infinite kaluza - klein modes of @xmath100 can correspond to the sterile neutrinos from the phenomenological point of view @xcite .",
    "the axion scenario is the most convincing solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "similarly to the previous section , however , the axion scenario also needs the intermediate scale that the peccei - quinn symmetry is broken at .",
    "here we shall avoid this difficulty by using the power - law running of coupling constants , which is characteristic of the context of large extra dimensions .",
    "assume that the axion , which is confined to our four dimensional wall , interacts with spinor fields @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which feel two extra dimensions whose radii are both @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 where @xmath118 represents the axion field .    in this case",
    "a wavefunction renormalization factor of the axion @xmath119 will scale according to the power - law running above the scale @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 is a cut - off and @xmath124 is an @xmath125 constant .    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is a vertex renormalization factor , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are wavefunction renormalization factors of @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .    here if we assume that the power - law running of @xmath119 is the strongest of the runnings of the @xmath130-factors , then @xmath131    next we put another assumption that the value of @xmath132 at the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale ( pq scale ) @xmath133 is much larger than @xmath134",
    ". then we obtain @xmath135    from the assumption , this suppression mainly comes from the power - law running of @xmath119 , so that all couplings including the axion field @xmath118 are expected to receive the same suppression factor as that of @xmath132 .",
    "for example , the coupling @xmath136 receives the suppression factor @xmath137 below the scale @xmath138 , thus effective pq scale @xmath139 becomes @xmath140    for instance , if we set @xmath141 and @xmath142  gev , then we shall obtain @xmath143  gev and this value satisfies the cosmological constraint .",
    "is satisfied by the volume factor suppression . ]",
    "we showed in the context of the large extra dimensions enough cp violation can be obtained from the spontaneous breakdown in a simple non - susy model , which is usually considered not to cause the spontaneous cp violation and estimated @xmath0 to be of order @xmath1 consistent with the experimental value .",
    "it is appealing that the same volume factors are used to generate both adequate smallness of the cp violation and the hierarchy among yukawa couplings , which is used to suppress the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) .",
    "our scenario does not depend on the higgs potential that has a cp violating minimum and no extra symmetries are introduced , so we can easily generalize our model to models with more complicated higgs sector .",
    "for example , two - higgs - doublet standard model with the exact discrete symmetry of natural flavor conservation can also cause the scpv in our scenario .",
    "the essence of our scenario is the existence of the suppressed extra yukawa matrices that have complex phases and become main sources of the cp violation .",
    "another work in this direction is , for example ref.@xcite , in which extra higgs doublets are introduced and peccei - quinn - like approximate symmetry are used to suppress the dangerous fcnc and the cp violation to the observed level . on the other hand ,",
    "we have used the volume factor suppression in the context of large extra dimensions instead of some approximate symmetries .    in our scenario , naive see - saw mechanism or axion scenario , which need an intermediate scale around @xmath98  gev ,",
    "can not be applied since the fundamental scale @xmath3 is tev scale . however ,",
    "these difficulties can be avoided by making use of the volume factor suppression or the power - law running of couplings , which are characteristic of the context of large extra dimensions .",
    "one can also consider the scenario that the yukawa couplings are generated at the scale @xmath3 and realize the hierarchy among the yukawa couplings as the hierarchy among quasi infrared fixed points ( qfps ) @xcite , but in such a case the coupling constants @xmath25 would become too small to realize the realistic value of @xmath0 . also , in this case @xmath39 has to be lift up to @xmath3 , we would need some mechanism that suppresses the power - law running of the gauge coupling constants , for example n=4 susy .",
    "so far we have not assumed supersymmetry because susy models have so many sources of the cp violation that the observed cp violation can be obtained without our scenario .",
    "however our scenario can be applied in susy models if we adopt an appropriate susy breaking mechanism ( for example scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite ) in which super - particles are heavy enough , squark masses are degenerate and so on . in this case , we can say that our scenario extends the parameter space that gives the observed cp violation in the scpv .",
    "here we introduced new five extra dimensions .",
    "these must satisfy the relation eq.([rlt - pf ] ) . in the case of @xmath145 , which is motivated by the superstring theory ,",
    "the remaining radius is about @xmath146 and satisfies the constraint from the gravity experiment ."
