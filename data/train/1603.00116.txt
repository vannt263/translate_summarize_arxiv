    "a succession of insights , starting with kane ",
    "mele s invariant @xcite and culminating in @xcite , led to an understanding and classification of topological insulators in terms of @xmath0-theory .",
    "the connection to @xmath0-theory is particularly important in view of earlier rigorous work on the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "these developments also provided new insight into how the @xmath0-theory of bulk and boundary systems are related .",
    "for various reasons it is actually closer to the spirit of condensed matter theory , as well as more flexible and appropriate , to use the more general @xmath1-algebraic @xmath0-theory rather than the topological version @xcite .",
    "the availability of @xmath1-algebraic machinery also opens the way to describe the same system in different forms , using powerful tools such as t - duality and the closely related baum ",
    "connes isomorphisms .",
    "whilst the geometric relationship between bulk and boundary is most simply expressed in position space , the physics of brillouin zones and fermi levels is more transparent in momentum space .",
    "t - duality moves between geometric and physical descriptions rather as the fourier transform flips position and momentum space in wave mechanics , and a recent series of papers has shown that the rather complicated map relating the physical bulk and boundary @xmath0-theory of topological insulators transforms under t - duality into the obvious geometrical restriction map @xcite .",
    "schematically , these results say that the following diagram commutes in many examples of physical interest : @xmath2_{\\parbox{5em}{\\footnotesize restriction to boundary } } \\ar[rrr]^{\\sim\\;}_{\\rm t - duality } & & & \\framebox{\\parbox{14em}{momentum space bulk invariant } } \\ar[dd]^{\\parbox{6em}{\\footnotesize bulk - boundary homomorphism } } \\\\ & & & \\\\ \\framebox{\\parbox{13em}{real space boundary invariant } }   \\ar[rrr]^{\\sim\\;\\;\\;\\;}_{\\rm t - duality\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; } & & & \\framebox{\\parbox{16.5em}{momentum space boundary invariant } } } \\label{metadiagram}\\ ] ] thus momentum space topological invariants ( e.g.  as defined over a brilluoin torus ) transform isomorphically under t - duality into real space invariants , in such a way that the bulk - boundary homomorphism becomes the simple geometric restriction - to - boundary map .",
    "the main result of this paper is the formalization and _ conceptual _ proof of the commutativity of diagram [ metadiagram ] in a very general setting .",
    "this result can then be specialized to analyze the bulk - boundary correspondence in : ( 1 ) arbitrary spatial dimensions , ( 2 ) in both the real and complex cases , ( 3 ) in the presence of disorder and/or magnetic fields , and ( 4 ) in the presence of h - flux .",
    "we had previously worked in some special subcases in which the groups of topological invariants in all four corners of diagram [ metadiagram ] , or at least the interesting ones , are computable ; then commutativity was verified by chasing around the diagram generator - by - generator . getting a concrete hold of the generators",
    "can be very useful when studying particular systems .",
    "nevertheless there are situations , particularly when disorder is modelled in the mathematical description , in which the relevant topological invariants are not easily computable .",
    "our abstract proof then becomes valuable and represents a significant advance compared to our earlier results .",
    "the physical importance of the first three cases is well - known and was also discussed in our earlier papers , so let us briefly elaborate on the fourth case .",
    "h - fluxes live in degree-3 cohomology and are important in string theory , although it seldom appears in condensed matter physics .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , they can be used to describe screw dislocations .",
    "more precisely , defects such as screw dislocations break the @xmath3 translation symmetry of the original @xmath4d euclidean lattice underlying a @xmath4d insulator , so that standard constructions like unit cells and brillouin zones are not available .",
    "this means that topological invariants in the presence of defects are not easily defined using standard methods appealing to bloch theory .",
    "we can circumvent this difficulty by requiring the defects to be distributed in a regular manner , allowing us to define topological invariants which are , in a precise sense , deformed versions of the usual ones arising from bloch theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , the non - isotropy introduced by the defects is expected to be reflected in boundary phenomena in the form of gapless modes localized along the dislocations @xcite",
    ".        there may be other applications , e.g.  dirac monopoles are known to be described by 3-cocycles @xcite .",
    "although monopoles have proved elusive , analogues have been created in condensed matter .",
    "bramwell et al . have detected them through the magnetic wien effect in spin ices , in particular , in single crystals of cubic dy@xmath5ti@xmath5o@xmath6 , @xcite , whilst ray et al .",
    "have produced detailed observations in a @xmath7rb bose ",
    "einstein condensate , @xcite .",
    "section [ sect : overview ] provides an overview of various t - duality transformations , applied to the bulk - boundary correspondence in a variety of settings .",
    "the algebras for the bulk and boundary from both the geometrical and physical perspective are defined very generally in section [ sect : bb ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : ctbulkboundary ] and corollary [ cor : restrictionequalspv ] formalizes the commutative diagram [ metadiagram ] in this general setting . the dixmier ",
    "douady classes , or h - fluxes , provide the main focus in section [ sect : fd ] , and we prove our ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 2.1 ) in theorem [ thm : productcase ] . section [ sect : heis ] contains examples and also generalisations of the discrete heisenberg groups , which play an important role in @xcite and often arise as symmetry groups in physical systems .",
    "the example of the three dimensional solvable group is also discussed here . in section [",
    "sect : disorder ] , we study the bulk - boundary correspondence for the higher dimensional quantum hall effect , as well as topological insulators with disorder in both the real and complex cases , generalising the 2d results of @xcite and the higher - dimensional results without disorder in @xcite . the appendix explains why paschke s map @xcite is essentially the same as the connes ",
    "thom isomorphism @xcite , both in the complex case and in the real case .",
    "the paschke map implements a type of t - duality transformation in 1d , and we derive his explicit formula starting from abstract arguments .",
    "formalizing and proving commutativity of diagram [ metadiagram ] is significant because it    * rigorously captures the geometric intuition behind the bulk - boundary correspondence ; * simplifies the complicated ( momentum space ) boundary map defined at the level of the physical @xmath1-algebras of observables ; * continues to hold even when the momentum space is _ noncommutative _ ( as in the iqhe ) , in the presence of _ disorder _",
    "@xcite , in the _ real _ case ( relevant for time - reversal symmetry ) , and in the _ parametrised _ and _ twisted _ setting of @xcite ( relevant to string theory in the presence of h - flux @xcite ) .    at the mathematical level ,",
    "the meta - principle expressed by the diagram naturally generalizes a simple phenomenon already present at the level of ordinary fourier transforms : integration in fourier space , which can be understood topologically as a push - forward map , picks out the constant fourier mode , so it is equivalent to the fourier transform of a `` restriction - to - zero '' map .",
    "physicists usually exploit an assumed @xmath8 translational symmetry ( e.g.  due to a periodic potential provided by a regular atomic lattice in euclidean space ) to _ define _ bulk / boundary topological invariants in quasi - momentum space .",
    "namely , one constructs from a @xmath8-symmetric hamiltonian , bloch vector bundles of single - electon states over the brillouin torus @xmath9 , which in turn define elements in the @xmath0-theory of @xmath9 . in more realistic models which incorporate magnetic fields and disorder",
    ", the brillouin zone may be _ noncommutative _ and the analogous construction yields elements in the @xmath0-theory of a twisted crossed product by @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore customary to start with the physical picture involving @xmath1-algebras of observables , and then t - dualize to obtain the geometrical one , but the exposition in this paper is a bit simpler if one starts with the geometric picture .    in any case , the intuition behind the bulk - boundary correspondence in physics is largely a _",
    "geometrical _ one .",
    "for example , in a semiclassical picture of the iqhe , the electrons in the bulk are confined to cyclotron orbits in the plane of the sample due to the applied perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "these circular orbits are intercepted by a geometrical boundary , leading to chiral edge currents , see figure  [ fig : cyclotron ] .",
    "the chirality of the edge phenomena also highlights a crucial necessary ingredient in modelling bulk - boundary correspondences .",
    "namely , although we are free to define topological invariants for the boundary system considered on its own , it is only from some intrinsic geometrical relationship between the boundary system and the bulk system that we can extract a notion of chirality . furthermore , not all possible boundary invariants are relevant , but only those which `` lift '' to an invariant associated to the bulk system .",
    "mathematically , this says that there should be a homomorphism mapping from bulk topological invariants to boundary ones , which need not be surjective or injective , and which is derived in a strong sense from some geometrical data about how the boundary is related to the bulk .",
    "geometrically we can visualise the bulk as a sort of finite or semi - infinite closed cylinder   with cross - section the boundary , and the interior of the bulk as the corresponding open cylinder .",
    "we denote the algebras corresponding to the boundary , the bulk , and the interior as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "( in the simplest cases they are just the functions on the geometric spaces defined by their spectra . )",
    "then the interior , @xmath12 , may be considered as the part of the bulk algebra vanishing  on the boundary , and we have the exact sequence @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the geometrical restriction - to - boundary map .",
    "standard theory enables us to extract from this short exact sequence an exact hexagon of the operator algebraic @xmath0-groups : @xmath15 the geometric relationship between the interior and boundary algebras , described in more detail in the next section , means that their @xmath0-theories differ only by a degree shift , @xmath16 , so that @xmath17    from the _ physical _ perspective the bulk , boundary , and interior algebras of observables , denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are the t - duals of their geometric counterparts , which are related by the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath19 fit in an extension , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a toeplitz - like algebra @xcite associated with @xmath19 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "one can show that the @xmath0-theories of @xmath22 and @xmath19 coincide , leading to another similar exact hexagon of k - groups : @xmath23 as explained in detail in @xcite , the toeplitz extension algebra @xmath22 may be interpreted as the bulk - with - boundary algebra , and vertical connecting maps @xmath24 in this diagram may be identified as the physical bulk - boundary homomorphism .",
    "as we explain in section [ sect : bb ] , t - duality simply interchanges the geometric and physical perspectives @xmath25 , @xmath26 . so far we have not said anything detailed about the maps in our exact hexagons , but we shall see that the geometric description is much simpler , and that the two hexagons encode the same information .",
    "( strictly speaking the t - dual of the geometric bulk algebra is only stably equivalent to the physical bulk algebra , but that gives the same @xmath0-theory . ) in particular , the bulk - boundary homomorphism @xmath24 which we are interested in becomes the geometric restriction map under t - duality , as one might expect from heuristics .",
    "the precise @xmath0-theory groups which are relevant for a given physical system vary in complexity , and accordingly , there are t - duality transformations of varying intricacy as summarized in table [ tdualitytable ] .",
    "the first three rows had been dealt with in previous papers @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the last three rows , which subsume the first three .",
    ".table of t - duality transformations [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to reflect physical features of the problem , such as brillouin zones , we introduce some lattices . on the geometric side ,",
    "let @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 be lattices of maximal rank in the vector spaces @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , of dimension @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively , with @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 will be associated with the bulk , @xmath31 with the boundary directions , and @xmath30 with the direction transverse to the boundary .",
    "we concentrate here on the case where the boundary has codimension 1 , so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , though the arguments have been written to suggest a way to include higher - codimensional boundaries .",
    "the main differences lie in the parity of the @xmath0-groups linked by connes ",

    "physically , @xmath42 is supposed to encode information about translational symmetries parallel to the boundary dimensions , for instance , it may not be completely straight . generally speaking , the collection of boundary symmetries determine what topological invariants may be associated to it , and the more symmetries there are , the more boundary invariants are available . ] , while @xmath43 encodes a transverse @xmath44-covariance ( e.g.  with respect to the position of the boundary )",
    ". we will often write @xmath45 for the action of @xmath46 , so that @xmath43 will be used both for the action and for its generator .    as already noted , an obvious way to model the interior would be as an open cylinder on the boundary , and , for an infinite cylinder",
    ", we could make this more precise by taking the interior algebra to be continuous @xmath10-valued functions on @xmath38 : @xmath47 .",
    "the bulk algebra @xmath11 , is then defined to be the _ induced algebra _",

    "there is automatically a translation action @xmath53 of @xmath30 on @xmath54 , which combines with the action of @xmath31 on @xmath10 to give an action of @xmath37 on @xmath11 .",
    "this action provides a reason to use the induced algebra rather than the mapping torus of which it is the periodic extension .",
    "the basic setup is summarized as follows :       * @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 with standard lattices @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 . * the geometrical boundary algebra @xmath10 is a real or complex separable @xmath1-algebra .",
