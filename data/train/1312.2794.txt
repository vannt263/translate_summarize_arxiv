    "it is worth pointing out that in both of the aforementioned papers , the initial process @xmath7 is constant ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , and @xmath21 is a lipschitz continuous function .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the problem of approximation of @xmath28 by @xmath26 in the case of arbitrary initial process @xmath7 and arbitrary continuous coefficient @xmath21 satisfying the linear growth condition ( [ eq1.2 ] ) .",
    "our proofs are based on new estimates for solutions of equations with penalization terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we consider a deterministic problem of approximating a solution of the skorokhod problem @xmath29 , @xmath30 on domain @xmath1 associated with a given function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 ( for precise definition , see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the penalization method involves approximating @xmath15 by solutions of equations of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 in the skorokhod topology @xmath27 .",

    "consequently , using discrete approximations constructed in a manner analogous to euler s formula , we prove the existence of a weak solution of the sde ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , provided that @xmath21 is continuous and satisfies ( [ eq1.2 ] ) . moreover , if the sde ( [ eq1.1 ] ) has the weak uniqueness property , then our approximations computed by simple recurrent formulas allows us to obtain numerical solution of the sde ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "in the case of reflected diffusion processes , similar approximation schemes have been considered previously ( see , e.g. , liu @xcite , pettersson @xcite , somiski @xcite ) . in this section",
