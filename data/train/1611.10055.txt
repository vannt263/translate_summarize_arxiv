    "since antiquity the regular hexagonal arrangement of bee honeycombs ( see fig [ comb]a ) has been an object of fascination .",
    "indeed it was the roman scholar marcus terentius varro who proposed in 36bc @xcite what is now known as the honeycomb conjecture : that hexagons are best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter .",
    "the conjecture was eventually proven in 1999 by thomas hales @xcite . however , the debate as the exact reasons as to why bees build such striking structures continues . while the need to minimise the total amount of wax used is part of it ( according to some estimates eight ounces of honey",
    "are consumed to produce one ounce of wax @xcite ) the reality is more complicated than the simple model considered in the honeycomb conjecture .",
    "( b ) an initial attempt to build a honeycomb on a curved surface - by placing a scharwz - p surface inside the hive .",
    "it can be seen that the bees do not confine the comb to the template surface and instead build around it .",
    "image credit : dr tim wetherell ]    one complication is that a honeycomb is not a single sided object .",
    "two layers of cells meet on a surface to make a single comb .",
    "the layers are slightly off - set from each other giving rise to a faceted wall between cells from opposing sides of the comb @xcite .",
    "surprisingly this arrangement ( which is realised in wild honeycombs ) is not the optimal least - wax - using solution @xcite .",
    "further deviations from the ideal arrangement also arise from the fact that cells are not always perfectly hexagonal ; distorted cells are often observed - especially when the bees encounter an obstacle in building the comb .",
    "the exact process by which the honeycomb is built also remains largely a mystery .",
    "there are two opposing schools of thought .",
    "the first supposes that the bees actively mold the arrangement of the cells until a regular pattern is achieved @xcite ; in his account of the process darwin proposed that the bees build the honeycomb by forming rough walls and refining them .",
    "the second school , dating back to at least darcy wentworth thompson , rejects this iterative model @xcite .",
    "they suggests that simple physical forces play a dominating role : the bees begin by building cells as a close packed ( triangular ) arrangement of cylindrical precursors , but the heat inside the hive keeps the wax molten allowing it to flow and minimise surface tension .",
    "thus mechanical tension between adjacent cells leads to a regular structure in a self - organised manner @xcite .",
    "attempts at real time imagining of the process in action have been made @xcite but the debate remain unresolved .    in light of this",
    ", we propose a novel experiment to probe the response of the bees when they are subjected to a constraint .",
    "we force the hive to build a honeycomb under conditions where the usual hexagonal arrangement is known not to be the optimal solution . here",
    "we describe our experimental attempt to build a honeycomb within the confines of two parallel negatively curved schwarz primitive surfaces ( see fig [ comb]b for our previous attempt involving only a single schwarz - p surface ) .",
    "such surfaces have a number of interesting properties including the fact that they have zero mean curvature everywhere and are periodic in all three directions @xcite .",
    "however , our interest in such surfaces is motivated by the fact that they present a unique challenge for any hive trying to build on it : the gaussian curvature is continuously changing and as such any patch of honeycomb built by the bees would be frustrated if they try to extend the local arrangement out over the rest of the surface .    although our attempt to build such a negatively curved honeycomb is only partially successful - nevertheless it may add something to the continuing debate .",
    "the question we seek to answer is : are the bees hard wired through evolution to build hexagons or do they optimise the arrangement `` on the fly '' as they are building ?",
    "it is well known that a curved surface can not be tiled entirely by hexagons alone @xcite . thus if the bees are forced to build a honeycomb within the confines of an unusual (",
    "although completely well understood ) geometry what will be the result ?",
    "will the hive adapt the regular honeycomb structure by including topological defects ( i.e. cells that have more or less than six sides ) .",
    "such defects are often observed in the self - assembly of two - dimensional crystals on curved surfaces @xcite , and their presence may hint at the underlying building processes at work .",
    "this leads to a second problem which we also discuss here : what is the least perimeter way to enclose a number of equal volume cells between parallel curved surfaces ? to answer such questions we turn to a related system that may provide further insight : monodisperse foams in confined geometries .",
    "due to surface tension the energy of a soap foam depends directly on its on the interfacial area separating bubbles . as such dry foams are a useful means to investigate area minimising partitions .",
    "indeed the similarity between the hexagonal bee honeycomb and geometry of the hexagonal two - dimensional dry foam has long been recognised .",
    "thus it is natural to ask how the foam structure is modified in the presence of curvature to compare with bee honeycombs between curved surfaces .    in recent years",
    "there has been a considerable progress in the study of two dimensional ( 2d ) foams obtained by trapping bubbles between two parallel flat glass plates ( the so called hele - shaw cell ) @xcite .",
    "such foams are not strictly two - dimensional and are more correctly referred to as being quasi-2d .",
    "however , provided the distance between the bounding plates is less than the bubble size then the effect of the third dimension can be neglected @xcite .",
    "in addition to the hele - shaw arrangement , foams have also been studied in a number of other confining geometries .",
    "an example of this is the injection of monodisperse bubbles into a wedge - like geometry . in this case , the increasing plate separation forces the bubbles to adopt a initial monolayer structure which gives way to a bilayer ( i.e. double - layer ) and subsequently a multilayer arrangement @xcite .",
    "variations in plate separation can also be used to control the rheology of highly ordered foams in microfluidic devices ; strategically placed `` bumps '' in the channel force rows of bubbles to swap positions @xcite .",
    "other notable examples include foams in narrow cylindrical channels where the geometry compels the bubbles to spontaneously self organise into various helical arrangements @xcite .",
    "bubble statistics and bubble dynamics of a foam trapped between narrowly separated concentric spheres have also been studied , as a direct means of testing the modified von neumann law for coarsening in the presence of curvature @xcite .    here - using the surface evolver package @xcite - we present a framework for simulating individual bubbles , and multicellular dry foams , that are confined between narrowly separated curved plates .",
    "the bounding surfaces are modelled using level - set functions and the resulting bubble morphology is then governed by the minimisation of surface tension energy .",
    "where possible we make use of content integrals ( see below ) to reduce the number of simulation elements required , thereby further reducing the numerical burden .",
    "we consider the following three cases :    * bubbles between concentric spherical plates ( i.e. surfaces of constant positive gaussian curvature ) ; * bubbles between concentric tori ( an arrangement with both positive and negative gaussian curvature ) ; and , * foams between confined between two schwarz primitive surfaces ( an important example of a surface with negative gaussian curvature ) ,    the basic geometry of each is shown in fig [ three ] . in the first two cases the bounding surfaces are curved and parallel to each other . by parallel",
    "we mean that the two plates are parallel surfaces of each other .",
    "thus if the points @xmath1 on the first surface @xmath2 are translated along the surface normal @xmath3 by a distance @xmath4 we obtain the second bounding plate @xcite , @xmath5 however , in the third case ( i.e. the p surface ) it is not possible to define a pair of parallel surfaces in this manner . below we describe the use of adjacent level set surface of the nodal approximation to the p surface , which we use to confine the bubble .",
    "however , this case will be more complex - compared to the spherical and toroidal cases - as variations in separation are anticipated to have significant consequences in determining the equilibrium morphology of a bubble ( or foam ) trapped between the substrates @xcite .",
    "there are clear analogies between cellular structures on curved surfaces ( whether they are foams or honeycombs ) and previous experimental attempts to pack particles on curved surfaces @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the curvature of the bounding surfaces induces a geometric frustration in the local crystalline order .",
    "this frustration is relieved by the presence of topological defects including disclinations , dislocations and more complex scar - like arrangements .",
    "we suppose that a similar mechanism may also govern the behaviour of quasi-2d foams on curved surfaces .",
    "where , such defects have already been observed in the case of strictly 2d foams on a sphere @xcite .",
    "however , the case of quasi-2d foams between curved plates may prove to be richer than either that of particles or strictly 2d - foams on curved surfaces .",
    "recently , we have shown that for a single bubble between a pair of parallel curved surfaces the surface tension energy of the bubble is sensitive to the gaussian curvature of the bounding plates @xcite .",
    "a bubble has a low surface tension energy when it is in a region of positive gaussian curvature and a high energy in a region of negative curvature .",
    "this energy difference can drive bubbles from a region of negative to positive curvature .",
    "thus , at least in the case of soap froths there is an additional force or potential as compared to the problem of packing particles on a curved surface .",
    "here we demonstrate some of the technical detail how curved interfaces can be represented by level set constraints in the surface evolver .",
    "we discuss the instructive example of a single bubble on a sphere , followed by a discussion of the toroidal geometry as an example of a complex geometry with negative and positive curved regions .",
    "we then discuss the generation of multicellular foams on the schwarz primitive surface using nodal representations , and a voronoi method to create the initial non - optimised partition .",
    "a bubble consists of a liquid interface with a surface tension @xmath6 enclosing a volume of gas @xmath7 .",
    "the total surface energy of the bubble is given by , @xmath8 where @xmath6 is assumed to be constant and @xmath9 is the surface area of the bubble .",
    "we assume that on two sides the bubble is bounded by solid surfaces , called substrates .",
    "the substrates are not necessarily flat but are smooth and frictionless .",
    "this allows the bubble interface to slide along the walls and relax to equilibrium .",
    "an interface makes a contact with angle @xmath10 with the wall given by young s law : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the surface tension on the two sides of the interface .",
    "we assume the soap solution wets the solid surface and that the wetting films on both sides have same surface tension . since both sides of the film contain the same gas , so that @xmath14 , this gives @xmath15 . as a result",
    "the soap film meets the confining wall at right angles ( normal incidence ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath14 the surface tension energy of the bubble depends entirely on the surface area of the ( transverse ) film between the walls , the wetting films in contact with the bounding surfaces make no contribution @xcite .",
    "simulations are conducted using the surface evolver package @xcite , which is an interactive _ finite element _ program for the study of interfaces shaped by surface tension .",
    "bubbles are represented by `` bodies '' which are comprised of oriented faces which are broken down into edges , which are in turn defined by vertices .    below we give details for modeling bubbles trapped between various plate geometries .",
    "the evolver can handle such boundaries by constraining vertices to lie on level sets functions specified by the user in the input data file @xcite .",
    "the data files ( below ) consist of an initial starting geometry and level set constraints that model the walls . in some cases",
    "the geometry of the bubble is further simplified through the use of _ content integrals _ ( as described immediately below ) .",
    "once the initial geometry of the bubble has been defined , the energy of the bubble is then minimised by applying gradient descent ( and other methods such as conjugate gradient ) while repeatedly refining the mesh to improve accuracy .",
    "the wetting surfaces of the bubble ( i.e. the surfaces in contact with the bounding substrates ) do not contribute to the surface tension energy of the bubble .",
    "as such the presence of these wetting surfaces in the surface evolver model represents an unnecessary numerical burden which can be removed .",
    "the problem then remains how to compute the volume of the the resulting open body ( i.e. the numerical representation of the bubble ) ?",
    "the solution is to compute the volume by a closed contour integral over the edges of the missing surface - such integrals are known as _ content integrals _ and are described fully in the surface evolver manual @xcite . in two cases below ( the spherical and toroidal geometries ) we are able to take advantage of the cylindrical symmetry of the situation and derive the appropriate content integrals .",
    "as such the bubble model in these cases consists solely of the transverse film between the walls . for a simple example of the use of content integrals for a bubble trapped between two horizontal _ flat _ plates see the canonical example _",
    "plates___column.fe _ @xcite .",
    "and an inner plate of radius @xmath16 . ]    in spherical polar coordinates @xmath17 with @xmath18 the parametrisation , @xmath19 describes a sphere as the locus of points @xmath20 that satisfy the equation @xmath21 .",

    "here we derive the content integral for a bubble between two concentric spheres .",
    "consider the spherical cap of radius @xmath25 on a sphere of radius @xmath26 as shown in fig [ sphereint ] .",

    "in the following we describe our experimental attempt to print a honeycomb onto a schwarz - p surface using bees .        our motivation was to analyse how the bees cope with or respond to negatively curved surfaces that have two essential properties .",
    "firstly , negatively curved surfaces ( such as the schwarz - p surface ) can never have constant gaussian and constant mean curvature .",
    "therefore , the bees would experience frustration in building the honeycomb - since at different points of the surface they encounter different surface curvatures . secondly ,",
    "it is not possible to tile a negatively - curved surface with hexagons only and so we were curious to see how the bees would modify the usual hexagonal motif to adapt to this constraint .    with this in mind we designed an enclosure comprised of two schwarz - p surfaces with a small gap between them ( of the type described above ) ,",
    "see fig [ bees]a .",
    "our hope was that the bees would then build a natural two - sided honeycomb in - between these two surface - that is one layer of cells are formed on the inner surface and another layer on the outer surface .",
    "the gap width was carefully chosen to be that of the height of two honeycomb cells and a little extra space for the bees to manoeuvre within the gap between cells from adjacent surfaces .",
    "we deliberately used only half the schwarz - p surface for the cell . with this design",
    "we did not need to use pins or other spacers between the surfaces to hold them at the appropriate distance .",
    "as such the bees had maximum freedom to build in any way they chose without obstructions due to the design of the cell .",
    "the cell was then constructed by rapid prototyping fig [ bees]b and the bees were allowed to enter the structure .",
    "the result after after repeated attempts was that the bees did build a honeycomb on part of the structure - see fig [ bees]c and fig [ bees]d .",
    "however , we did not obtain a complete tiling of the two surfaces .",
    "ultimately , we believe that the strongly curved surface proved to much of a frustration to the bees and they only attempted to build on the regions that were immediately accessible and neglected to proceed further inwards .",
    "we have presented some of our on - going work to simulate foams between curved surfaces . in the future",
    "we will implement these numerical techniques and examine the role of curvature in determining the morphology and dynamics of quasi-2d foams .",
    "we also hope to repeat the bee experiment using the insight gained from our first attempt .",
