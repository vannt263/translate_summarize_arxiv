    "anomalous temperature dependence of the magnetotransport coefficients in the normal state of high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors has been discussed intensively as the evidence for the breakdown of the fermi - liquid theory.@xcite experimental data are roughly summarized as@xcite @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature and @xmath5 is the external magnetic field .",
    "thus kohler s rule , expected from the ordinary transport theory based on the quasiparticle of the fermi liquid , is strongly violated in a _ wide _ temperature range .",
    "on the other hand , it has been claimed@xcite that such a violation of kohler s rule can be derived from the quasiparticle transport within the framework of the fermi - liquid theory if the momentum - dependence of the scattering due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation is fully taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we show that the quasiparticle - transport theory is inadequate to explain the anomaly in section ii and that the collective - transport theory beyond the quasiparticle is necessary in section iii .",

    "the effect of the vertex correction beyond the relaxation - time approximation is discussed in appendix a.    in order to obtain analytic results we use a model for the mean free path @xmath12 employed in the previous studies@xcite here @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . from this model",
    "we can know qualitative features of the quasiparticle transport , though it is insufficient for quantitative discussions .    for this model replacing @xmath8 by @xmath17",
    "we obtain @xmath18 while eqs .",
    "( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) agree with the previous result,@xcite eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) corrects the previous result@xcite as discussed in appendix b.    if @xmath19 does not depend on the temperature , eqs.(2.5)-(2.7 ) satisfy kohler s rule . although some violation of the rule can be derived from the temperature - dependence of @xmath19 , it is impossible to explain the experimentally observed violation in a _ wide _ temperature range .",
    "namely it is impossible to obtain @xmath20 and @xmath21 , from the scattering due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation , in a _ wide _ temperature range consistent with the experiments .",
    "such a criticism has also been made by other authors@xcite in another context .",
    "another criticism should be made for the case where the mean free path @xmath6 is calculated from the phenomenological spin susceptibility.@xcite in those studies the self - consistency between the susceptibility and the self - energy for electrons has been neglected .",
    "the requirement of the self - consistency weaken the temperature dependence of the hall constant expected from the phenomenology@xcite as has been shown by the numerical study based on the fluctuation - exchange approximation.@xcite consequently the temperature dependence of the hall constant within the relaxation - time approximation is far weaker than that observed by the experiments",
    ".    in conclusion , only weak violation of kohler s rule can be derived from the momentum - dependence of the transport life - time within the quasiparticle transport described by the boltzmann equation .",
    "by the discussions in  2 it has become clear that the anomalous temperature dependence observed in the normal state of high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors can not be explained within the quasiparticle transport .",
    "however , it does not directly lead to the breakdown@xcite of the fermi - liquid theory",
    ". there exists the collective contribution beyond the quasiparticle within the linear response theory based on the fermi liquid : for example , the contributions c and d to the hall conductivity discussed in ref .",
    "18 correspond to the collective ones , while the contributions a and b constitute the quasiparticle transport theory consistent with the boltzmann equation .",
    "the collective contributions arise in the presence of the magnetic field so that kohler s rule is strongly violated in a _ wide _ temperature range.@xcite    the collective transport theory is well established in the case of superconducting fluctuation.@xcite in the case of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation relevant to the cuprate superconductors , the collective transport theory has been developed by the present authors@xcite in parallel with the case of superconducting fluctuation .",
    "( see appendix c. )    the collective transport is necessary in the case of cuprates , since the anomalous phase with broken kohler s rule is proximity to the antiferromagnetic insulator where the low - energy excitation is the spin wave and there is no quasiparticle at low energies .",
    "it should be noted that the collective contributions are minor ones unless the spin fluctuation has the nesting character.@xcite the heart of the collective transport for the nested spin fluctuation is that the anomaly is regarded as @xmath22 singularity of the charge fluctuation triggered by two modes of the spin fluctuation with @xmath23 singularity.@xcite the @xmath22 singularity is observed by the diffusive x - ray scattering experiment.@xcite    in conclusion , the strong violation of kohler s rule should be ascribed to the collective contribution beyond the quasiparticle contribution described by the boltzmann equation .",
    "we have shown that the anomalous temperature dependence of the magnetotransport coefficients in the normal state of high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors is derived , within the framework of the fermi - liquid theory , from the collective contribution of the nested spin fluctuation beyond the quasiparticle contribution described by the boltzmann equation .",
    "in addition , other transport coefficients should have the collective contribution from the nested spin fluctuation .",

    "while their study is in the framework of the fermi - liquid theory , such a claim contradicts with the previous studies@xcite based on the fermi - liquid theory . in the following we show that the flex approximation does not give the correct vertex correction discussed above .    in order to obtain the correct vertex correction , eq .",
    "( a.1 ) , consistent with the pauli exclusion principle for fermions , at least following two conditions should be satisfied .",
    "first , the four - point vertex appearing in fig .  1 should satisfy the so - called crossing or exchange symmetry . in the previous studies@xcite based on the fermi - liquid theory this symmetry",
    "is assumed .",
    "for example , the four - point vertex @xmath46 in the particle - hole channel shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and @xmath47 in the particle - particle channel shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) are assumed to be identical . on the other hand , in the flex approximation such",
    "a symmetry is broken.@xcite for example , the ladder process typical in the flex approximation shown in fig .",
    "3 can not be identical in the sense discussed above .",
    "second , only low - energy states described by the singular part of the electron green function should appear connecting each vertices in the vertex correction of the fermi - liquid shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this limitation ensures that the resistivity is proportional to @xmath48 in the ordinary fermi - liquid theory . on the other hand , in the flex approximation@xcite this limitation",
    "is violated in the so - called maki - thompson process which has no counterpart in the fermi - liquid theory .",
    "namely , the maki - thompson process contains unphysical high - energy states in comparison with the process of fig .",
    "1(a ) . while the maki - thompson process is treated on equal footing with the so - called aslamazov - larkin processes corresponding to figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) in the fermi - liquid theory and such a treatment guarantees the vanishing resistivity in the absence of umklapp scattering as stressed in ref .",
    "29 , the maki - thompson process is overestimated in the flex approximation .",
    "it is natural to expect that the fact , that the aslamazov - larkin processes have little effect on the transport coefficients , found in the flex approximation@xcite supports the validity of the relaxation - time approximation .",
    "the reason , why the vertex correction in fig .  1 plays little role besides",
    "the introduction of the transport life - time , is obvious from the previous study:@xcite the contribution from the two four - point vertices and two green functions connecting them , and the one from the two green functions connecting the four - point vertex and the three - point vertex , both of which are related to the imaginary part of the electron selfenergy , cancel out and the remaining effect is mostly taken into account by introducing the transport life - time",
    ".    the theoretical results by the flex approximation can not be compatible with the experiments at least by two reasons .",
    "first , the magnetotransport anomaly in the normal state of high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors should be understood in a single framework which can explain the so - called pseudogap phenomena,@xcite while the flex approximation at present can not explain the pseudogap .",
    "second , anomalous temperature dependences observed in several experiments@xcite can not be ascribed to the vertex correction .",

    "the second integral in eq .",
    "( b.1 ) has been omitted .",
    "the collective contribution of the aslamazov - larkin process of the superconducting fluctuation to the hall conductivity is proportional to @xmath52 where @xmath52 is the energy derivative of the density of states at the fermi energy .",

    "4(a ) by attaching three current vertices to it . in this process the electron with the momentum @xmath55 and the fermionic frequency @xmath56 interacts with the hole with @xmath57 and @xmath58 and feels a reduced magnetic field by the motion of the hole .",
    "if we consider free electrons , @xmath52 is positive and so that the hall conductivity due to the superconductive fluctuation is positive , while the hall conductivity due to the quasiparticle is negative . in the case of nested spin fluctuation",

    "4(b ) where the electron with @xmath55 and @xmath56 interacts with the electron with @xmath59 and @xmath56 .",
