    "( 1998 ) and van der werf ( 1999 ) , the results of these _ iso _ observations are fully consistent with the non - detection of redshifted fine - structure emission from high - redshift galaxies using ground - based submillimetre - wave telescopes .",
    "the results of kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) observations of the galactic centre ( erickson et al .",
    "1991 ) indicate that 63- and 146-@xmath0 m neutral oxygen [ oi ] fine - structure emission becomes steadily more luminous as compared with that from [ cii ] as the far - infrared luminosity of gas clouds increases . however , currently there is insufficient published data available to address this issue in external galaxies .",
    "we attempt here to predict the counts of distant gas - rich line - emitting galaxies that could be detected in the millimetre / submillimetre waveband .",
    "there are two challenges to making reliable predictions .",
    "first , there are limited data available from which to construct a clear understanding of the astrophysics of the ism in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "there are only a few tens of detections of line emission from these objects , the majority of which have been made in galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies . because of the potential for differential magnification across and within the lensed galaxy , neither the ratios of the line and continuum luminosities nor the excitation conditions in the ism are known accurately in these cases . as shown by _",
    "iso _ [ cii ] observations , extrapolation of the observed properties of low - redshift galaxies with relatively low luminosities to greater luminosities in high - redshift galaxies is not necessarily reliable .",
    "secondly , the space density and form of evolution of gas - rich galaxies at high redshifts has not been well determined .",
    "thus the existing predictions of the observability of high - redshift submillimetre - wave line emission have concentrated on either discussing the potential observability of individual high - redshift galaxies ( van der werf & israel 1996 ; silk & spaans 1997 ; combes et al .  1999 ; van der werf 1999 ) , or have relied on extensive extrapolations , from the populations of low - redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( blain 1996 ) and from low - redshift @xmath1 bulges to the properties of proto - quasars at @xmath2 ( loeb 1993 )",
    ".    both of these difficulties can be addressed by exploiting the results of deep 450- and 850-@xmath0 m dust continuum radiation surveys made using the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera ( holland et al .",

    "the 15-arcsec angular resolution of the jcmt is rather coarse , but reliable identifications can be made by combining the scuba images with multi - waveband follow - up images and spectra ( ivison et al .  1998b , 2000 ; smail et al .",

    "the most significant differences between the values of @xmath15 predicted in the lvg , 38-k and 53-k models occur in the higher @xmath16 lines , for which the effect of the higher excitation temperature and the subthermal excitation of lines in the lvg model is greater .",

    "the 230-ghz count expected at this depth , after correcting the results shown in fig.1(b ) for the narrower bandwidth , is about 50deg@xmath71 . a serendipitous line detection",

    "this is because observations in many tens of 1-ghz bands would have been required to search for a co emission line from these galaxies without an optical redshift , and so the source count of lines at the detected flux density is expected to be about two orders of magnitude less than that of the dust continuum - selected galaxies .",
    "the large ground - based millimetre / submillimetre - wave interferometer array alma will provide excellent subarcsecond angular resolution and a large collecting area for observations of submillimetre - wave continuum and line radiation . based on the performance described for alma at 230ghz by wootten ( 2000 )",
    ", a 300-km - s@xmath7 line with an integrated flux density of @xmath111wm@xmath71 could be detected at @xmath105 significance , but not resolved , anywhere within a 16-ghz band in about 1hr in the 0.15-arcmin@xmath107 primary beam .",
    "the surface density of lines brighter than this flux density is expected to be about @xmath112deg@xmath71 ( fig.1b ; see also blain 2000 ) , and so a detection rate of about 1.7hr@xmath7 would be expected .",
    "the knee in the counts in fig.1(b ) , indicating the most efficient survey depth , is at a flux density greater than about @xmath98wm@xmath71 , a depth reached in an integration time of about 10s at 5@xmath109 significance .",
    "hence , making a large mosaic map at this depth , covering an area of 0.017deg@xmath107hr@xmath7 should maximize the detection rate , which would then be about 15 galaxies per hour , neglecting scanning overheads incurred in the mosaiking process .",
    "this detection rate would allow large samples of line - emitting high - redshift galaxies to be compiled rapidly using alma .",
    "the performance of alma in line searches is discussed in more detail by blain ( 2000 ) .      at present the heterodyne spectrographs fitted to the jcmt , the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , and the iram 30-m antenna are not sufficiently sensitive to allow a blank - field survey to search for distant line emitting galaxies .",
    "for example , the 230-ghz receiver at the jcmt , which is the least susceptible to atmospheric noise , can reach a 5@xmath109 sensitivity of about @xmath113wm@xmath71 in a 1-hr observation in a 1.8-ghz band centred on 230ghz . at this flux density",
    "the surface density of co line emitting galaxies is expected to be @xmath114deg@xmath71 ( see fig.1b ) , and so because the beam area is @xmath115deg@xmath107 , many tens of thousands of hours of observation would be required to detect a source serendipitously .",
    "the development of wide - band correlators , such as the 3.25-ghz wasp ( isaak , harris & zmuidzinas 1999 ) , will improve the performance of single - antenna telescopes significantly for the detection of faint lines in galaxies with a known redshift , but unless bandwidths are increased by at least an order of magnitude , blank - field line searches from the ground will not be practical .      at present ,",
    "submillimetre - wave emission lines from a particular distant galaxy can only be detected if an accurate redshift has been determined , because the instantaneous bandwidth of receivers is narrow , and accurate tuning is required for a target line to be observed within the available band",
    ". for galaxies and agn detected in blank - field submillimetre continuum surveys , obtaining a spectroscopic redshift requires a very considerable investment of observing time ( see , e.g. , smail et al .",
    "however , if a much wider bandwidth of order @xmath116 could be observed simultaneously , then a co line would always lie within the observing band from a galaxy at redshift @xmath78 .",
    "there are currently two ways to increase the instantaneous bandwidth of a ground - based millimetre - wave telescope , both based on bolometer detectors rather than heterodyne mixers .",
    "either a resonant cavity , such as a fabry  perot , or a diffraction grating could be used to feed an array of bolometer detectors .",
    "the potential of such instruments are discussed in the subsections below .",
    "spifi is a @xmath117 element fabry - perot interferometer , for use at frequencies from 460 to 1500ghz on both the 1.7-m ast - ro telescope at the south pole and the 15-m jcmt ( stacey et al .",
    "1996 ; bradford et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "on ast - ro , in the 350-@xmath0 m ( 850-ghz ) atmospheric window , the field of view of the instrument is about 25arcmin@xmath107 . at a coarse 300-km - s@xmath7 resolution , a bandwidth of about 8ghz can be observed to a @xmath105 detection threshold of about @xmath118wm@xmath71 in a 1-hr integration . on the 15-m jcmt , at the same frequency and for the same bandwidth , the field of view and the @xmath105 detection threshold are both less , about 0.3arcmin@xmath107 and @xmath119wm@xmath71 respectively .    from fig.1(d ) , the count at flux densities brighter than the 5@xmath109 detection threshold for the jcmt are expected to be about 30deg@xmath71 , and to be dominated by [ cii]-emitting galaxies , for which the counts are very uncertain .",
    "hence a serendipitous detection would be expected about every 400hr , and so blank - field line surveys using spifi are on the threshold of being practical",
    ". a second - generation instrument with a wider field of view should be capable of making many detections in a reasonable integration time .",
    "an alternative approach to obtaining a wide simultaneous bandwidth would be to build a grating spectrograph to disperse the signal from a 10-m ground - based telescope onto linear arrays of bolometers",
    ". such an instrument would be able to observe a reasonably large fraction of the clear 150250ghz atmospheric window simultaneously , at a background - limited @xmath120 sensitivity of about @xmath98wm@xmath71 in a 1-hr observation , which is uniform to within a factor of about two across this spectral range .",
    "the predicted counts of lines in this spectral range are of order 100deg@xmath71 at this depth ( fig.3a ) , and are expected to be dominated by co lines , for which the predicted counts should be reasonably accurate . at 200ghz the field of view of a 10-m telescope is about 0.2arcmin@xmath107 , and so a 5@xmath109 detection rate of about 0.05hr@xmath7 would be expected in a blank - field line survey .",
    "a grating instrument with these specifications is thus on the threshold of being useful for conducting such a survey .",
    "it would also be very valuable for detecting co lines emitted by the high - redshift galaxies detected in dust continuum surveys whose positions are known to within about 10arcsec .",
    "an instantaneous bandwidth of order 100ghz would accommodate either 2 or 3 co lines for a @xmath121 galaxy , and so a spectroscopic redshift could be determined without recourse to radio , optical or near - infrared telescopes . for example , the @xmath122 scuba galaxy smmj02399@xmath30136 has an integrated flux density of @xmath123wm@xmath71 in the co(3@xmath252 ) transition ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 ) , and all the co(@xmath16 + 1@xmath25@xmath16 ) transitions with @xmath16=5 , 6 , 7 and 8 fall within the 150250ghz spectral range .",
    "based on the lvg model ( table1 ) , these lines are expected to have integrated flux densities of @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127wm@xmath71 respectively .",
    "thus , in a 5-hr integration in the field of smmj02399@xmath30136 , all but the co(8@xmath257 ) line could be detected using a background - limited grating spectrograph , allowing its redshift to be determined unequivocally in a comparable time to that required to obtain an optical redshift using a 4-m telescope ( ivison et al .",
    "there are two further advantages .",
    "first , the co - line redshift would be the redshift of cool gas in the ism of the galaxy , and not that of optical emission lines , which are typically blueshifted by several 100kms@xmath7 with respect to the ism .",
    "secondly , the ratios of the luminosities of the detected co lines would reveal information about the physical conditions in the cool ism where star - formation takes place .",
    "low-@xmath16 co lines are redshifted into the centimetre waveband for redshifts @xmath128 .",
    "instruments operating in this waveband include the vla and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "currently , the vla can observe spectral lines in a very narrow 87.5-mhz band , centred in the k band ( 2224ghz ) and q band ( 4050ghz ) . in the k band , ivison et al .",
    "( 1996 ) attempted to detect co(1@xmath250 ) emission from the environment of a dusty radio galaxy at @xmath129 , and in 12hours they obtained a @xmath105 upper limit of about @xmath130wm@xmath71 in a 2-arcmin beam .",
    "because of the very narrow bandwidth , the detection rate of co line - emitting galaxies with the k - band vla in a blank - field survey is expected to be about 1yr@xmath7 . however , by 2002 fibre - optic links and a new correlator will be installed , increasing the simultaneous bandwidth greatly to 8ghz , and improving the @xmath105 sensitivities to @xmath131 and @xmath132wm@xmath71 in 12-hr k- and q - band integrations respectively .",
    "the counts of line - emitting galaxies at @xmath133 in these bands are shown in fig.2 . at these sensitivities ,",
    "k- and q - band counts of about 500 and 2000deg@xmath71 are expected respectively , each corresponding to a detection rate of about 0.03hr@xmath7 .",
    "the knee in the counts at which the detection rate is maximized is expected at rather similar flux densities of about @xmath134 and @xmath135wm@xmath71 in the k and q bands respectively , depths which can be reached in about 140- and 190-min integrations and at which the counts are expected to be about 100 and 400deg@xmath71 respectively .",
    "the most efficient detection rates in the k and q bands are thus expected to be about 0.04 and 0.03hr@xmath7 .",
    "hence , low-@xmath16 blank - field co - line surveys will be practical using the upgraded vla .",

    "these sensitivities make the gbt even more suitable for detecting low-@xmath16 co lines from known high - redshift galaxies than the vla , but the subarcminute field of view of the gbt is too small to allow a practical blank - field survey . at these sensitivity limits ,",
    "only @xmath139 and @xmath140 lines per beam are expected in the k and q bands respectively .      the 3.5-m space - borne telescope _ first _ ( pilbratt 1997 ) will carry the hifi far - infrared / submillimetre - wave spectrometer ( whyborn 1997 ) and the spire bolometer array camera ( griffin et al .",
    "both of these instruments operate at frequencies for which fine - structure lines are expected to dominate the counts of line - emitting galaxies , and so the number of detectable galaxies is necessarily uncertain .",
    "the spectral coverage of hifi extends from 500 to 1100ghz .",
    "the instrument will have a 4-ghz bandwidth , a 0.4-arcmin@xmath107 field of view and a 5@xmath109 sensitivity of about @xmath141wm@xmath71 in a 1-hr integration at 650ghz .",
    "the spire fourier transform spectrograph ( spire - fts ) will provide a spectroscopic view of a 2-arcmin - square field at all frequencies between 460ghz and 1.5thz simultaneously .",
    "the 5@xmath109 detection threshold of a line in a 1-hr integration is expected to be about @xmath142wm@xmath71 .",
    "the slope of the counts shown in figs1(d ) and 3(b ) , which are based on the estimated , and very uncertain , counts of [ cii ] lines , indicate that the most efficient survey depth is greater than @xmath143wm@xmath71 for hifi and about @xmath144wm@xmath71 for spire - fts . at a depth of @xmath144wm@xmath71 ,",
    "the optimal detection rates using hifi and spire - fts are expected to be about @xmath145 and @xmath146hr@xmath7 respectively , and so the detection rate of line - emitting galaxies using first is expected to be quite low .",
    "the currently quoted sensitivities of _ first_-hifi are about seven times better than those of the heterodyne instruments attached to the 2.5-m sofia airborne telescope ( becklin 1997 ; davidson 2000 ) .",
    "thus , when the larger field of view of sofia is taken into account , a line - emitting galaxy could be detected using sofia about every 4500hr .",
    "hence , sofia could not carry out a successful blank - field line emission survey .",
    "note , however , that the instruments aboard sofia will be upgraded throughout its 20-year lifetime , and so the development of multi - element detectors and innovative wide - band spectrographs may change this situation .    the proposed space - borne far - infrared interferometer _ specs _ ( mather et al .",
    "1998 ) has very great potential for resolving and obtaining very high signal - to - noise spectra of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "although predictions of the detectability of fine - structure lines at frequencies greater than 600ghz are very uncertain , with a field of view of about 0.25deg@xmath71 at 650ghz and a @xmath105 sensitivity of about 10@xmath147wm@xmath71 in a 24-hr integration , about 5 [ cii ] galaxies could be detected per day using _ specs _ in a 8-ghz - wide band ( fig.1d ) .",
    "hence , although _ specs _ is predominantly an instrument to study known galaxies in great detail , its sensitivity is sufficient to carry out successful blank - field line surveys .",
    "the most promising instruments for future surveys of co and fine - structure lines from high - redshift galaxies are the alma interferometer array in the 140- and 230-ghz bands , which should be able to detect about 15 galaxies an hour in a survey to a line flux density of @xmath98wm@xmath71 in a 16-ghz - wide band .",
    "other instruments for which detection rates are expected to exceed one source per hundred hours are the future _ specs _ space - borne interferometer , which is likely to detect of order of five fine structure line - emitting galaxies per day , and a ground - based , wide - band , background - limited millimetre - wave grating spectrograph , which should be able to detect a line - emitting galaxy every 20hr , the same rate as the upgraded k- and q - band vla .",
    "we draw the following conclusions    1 .",
    "we have predicted the surface densities of high - redshift galaxies that emit molecular rotation and atomic fine - structure line radiation that is redshifted into the millimetre / submillimetre waveband .",
    "the results depend on both the excitation conditions in the ism of the galaxies and the evolution of the properties of distant gas - rich galaxies .",
    "we incorporate the latest results of co - line observations and the redshift distribution of galaxies discovered in submillimetre - wave continuum surveys to provide a sound observational basis for these predictions . 2 .   the predicted counts of co line - emitting galaxies are probably accurate to within a factor of about 5 for lines with @xmath42",
    "the uncertainties are inevitable , and caused by the lack of knowledge of both the cosmological model and the excitation state of the emitting gas in the ism of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the predictions of the counts of atomic fine - structure lines in high - redshift ultraluminous galaxies are more weakly constrained by observations , and we present likely order - of - magnitude estimates of the counts in six such lines .",
    "the most efficient frequency for a survey that aims to detect co emission is probably in the range 200400ghz , which includes the 230- and 350-ghz atmospheric windows .",
    "the optimal frequencies for a fine - structure line survey are probably in the range 400800ghz , which includes the 670- and 850-ghz atmospheric windows .",
    "there are excellent prospects for using a range of millimetre- and submillimetre - wave instruments that are currently under development to conduct blank - field surveys for the redshifted emission lines from the ism in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "alma will probably prove the most capable facility for blank - field surveys , and should detect up to about 15 line - emitting galaxies per hour .",
    "the most efficient survey is likely to be made in the 140- and 230-ghz bands to a an integrated line flux density of a few @xmath98wm@xmath71 .",
    "the required sensitivities could also be achieved by future wide - band spectrometers on single - antenna telescopes .",
    "low-@xmath16 co transitions will be detectable using the upgraded vla at longer millimetre and centimetre wavelengths . 6 .",
