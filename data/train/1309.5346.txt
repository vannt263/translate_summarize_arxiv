    "hilbert @xmath7 problem represents one of the open question in mathematics and it has produced an impressive amount of publications throughout the last century .",
    "the study of this problem in the context of equivariant dynamical systems is a relatively new branch of analysis and is based on the development within the last twenty years of the theory of golubitsky , stewart and schaeffer in @xcite . other authors @xcite have specifically considered this theory when studying the limit cycles and related phenomena in systems with symmetry . roughly speaking",
    "the presence of symmetry may complicate the bifurcation analysis because it often forces eigenvalues of high multiplicity .",
    "this is not the case of planar systems ; on the contrary , it simplifies the analysis because of the reduction to isotypic components .",
    "more precisely it allows us to reduce the bifurcation analysis to a region of the complex plane .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the @xmath0equivariant system @xmath8 where @xmath9    the general form of the @xmath10equivariant equation is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a polynomial of degree @xmath13.$ ] the study of this class of equations is developed in several books , see @xcite , when the resonances are strong , _ i.e. _ @xmath14 or weak @xmath15 the special case @xmath16 is also treated in several other articles , see @xcite . in these mentioned works",
    "it is said that the weak resonances are easier to study than the other cases , as the equivariant term @xmath17 is not dominant with respect to the function on @xmath18 this is true if the interest lies in obtaining a bifurcation diagram near the origin , but it is no longer true if the analysis is global and involves the study of limit cycles .",
    "this is the goal of the present work : studying the global phase portrait of system paying special attention to the existence , location and uniqueness of limit cycles surrounding 1 , 7 or 13 critical points . as far as we know this is the first work in which the existence of limit cycles is studied for this kind of systems .",
    "the main result of our paper is the following .",
    "[ teorema principal ] consider equation with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and define the quantities : @xmath21 then , the following statements are true :    * if one of the conditions @xmath22 is satisfied , then equation has at most one limit cycle surrounding the origin . furthermore ,",
    "when the limit cycle exists it is hyperbolic .",
    "* there are equations under condition @xmath23 having exactly one limit cycle surrounding either @xmath24 or @xmath25 critical points , and equations under condition @xmath26 having exactly one hyperbolic limit cycle surrounding either @xmath27 critical points if @xmath28 , or the only critical point if @xmath29 .     outside the dark intersection of the two shaded areas , when @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "solid line is @xmath32 , dashed line stands for @xmath33 , dotted line corresponds to @xmath34 and dashed - dotted to @xmath35 . for @xmath36 outside the interval @xmath37",
    "there are at most 7 equilibria , but when @xmath36 lies in that interval , there may be 13 equilibria surrounded by a limit cycle . ]    the conditions @xmath26 and @xmath23 of theorem  [ teorema principal ] hold except when @xmath36 lies in @xmath38 .",
    "the intersection of the two intervals is often empty , but this is not always the case as the example of figure  [ figsigmas ] shows .",
    "examples of the relative positions of the two intervals are also given in figure  [ a - b - cp ] below .",
    "our strategy for proving theorem  [ teorema principal ] will be to transform the system into a scalar abel equation and to study it .",
    "conditions @xmath26 and @xmath23 define regions where one of the functions in the abel equation does not change sign .",
    "since these functions correspond to derivatives of the poincar return map , this imposes an upper bound on the number of limit cycles .",
    "when either @xmath36 lies in the intersection of the two intervals , or @xmath39 , this analysis is not conclusive , and the study of the equations would require other methods .",
    "the qualitative meaning of conditions of statement ( a ) of the previous theorem is also briefly explained and illustrated in remark [ remark3 ] and in figure  [ a - b - cp ] below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ preliminary results ]",
    "we state some preliminary results while in section [ analysis of the critical points ] the study of the critical points is performed .",
    "section [ proof of theorem @xmath40 is entirely devoted to the proof of the main theorem of the paper .",
    "we start by obtaining the symmetries of . following @xcite , a system of differential equations @xmath41",
    "is said to be @xmath42equivariant if it commutes with the group action of @xmath43 ie .",
    "@xmath44 here @xmath45 with the standard action on @xmath46 generated by @xmath47 acting by complex multiplication .",
    "applying this concept to equation we have the following result .",
    "equation is @xmath0equivariant .",
    "let @xmath48 then a simple calculation shows that @xmath49 .",
    "this is true because the monomials in @xmath2 , @xmath50 appearing in the expression of @xmath51 are the following : @xmath52 , which is @xmath53-equivariant , and monomials of the form @xmath54 , that are @xmath55equivariant for all @xmath56 .",
    "equation represents a perturbation of a hamiltonian one and in the following we identify conditions that some parameters have to fulfill in order to obtain this hamiltonian .",
    "we have the following result .",
    "[ teo - ham ] the hamiltonian part of @xmath0equivariant equation is @xmath57    an equation @xmath58 is hamiltonian if @xmath59 for equation we have @xmath60 and consequently it is hamiltonian if and only if @xmath61    as we have briefly said in the introduction , we reduce the study of system to the analysis of a scalar equation of abel type .",
    "the first step consists in converting equation from cartesian into polar coordinates .",
    "[ lema abelian ] the study of periodic orbits of equation that surround the origin , for @xmath62 , reduces to the study of non contractible solutions that satisfy @xmath63 of the abel equation    @xmath64    where @xmath65    using the change of variables @xmath66 and the time rescaling , @xmath67",
    "it follows that the solutions of equation are equivalent to those of the polar system @xmath68 from equation we obtain @xmath69 then we apply the cherkas transformation @xmath70 , see @xcite , to get the scalar equation .",
    "obviously the limit cycles that surround the origin of equation are transformed into non contractible periodic orbits of equation , as they can not intersect the set @xmath71 for more details see @xcite .    as we have already mentioned in the introductory section ,",
    "our goal in this work is to apply the methodology developed in @xcite to study conditions for existence , location and unicity of the limit cycles surrounding @xmath24 and @xmath25 critical points .",
    "a natural way for proving the existence of a limit cycle is to show that , in the poncar compactification , infinity has no critical points and both infinity and the origin have the same stability .",
    "therefore , we would like to find the sets of parameters for which these conditions are satisfied . in the following lemma",
    "we determine the stability of infinity .",
    "[ lema characterization origin ] consider equation in the poincar compactification of the plane .",
    "then :    * there are no critical points at infinity if and only if @xmath72 * when @xmath73 infinity is an attractor ( resp . a repellor ) when @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) and the opposite when @xmath76    the proof follows the same steps as the lemma @xmath77 in @xcite . after the change of variable @xmath78 in system and reparametrization",
    "@xmath79 we get the system @xmath80 giving the invariant set @xmath81 that corresponds to the infinity of system .",
    "consequently , it has no critical points at infinity if and only if @xmath82 to compute the stability of infinity in this case , we follow @xcite and study the stability of @xmath83 in the system above .",
    "this stability is given by the sign of @xmath84 and the result follows .",
    "in this section we are going to analyze which conditions must be satisfied to ensure that equation has one , seven or thirteen critical points . obviously , the origin of the system is always a critical point .",
    "we are going to prove that it is _ monodromic _ : there is no trajectory of the differential equations that approaches the critical point with a definite limit direction .    for this purpose , let us define the generalized lyapunov constants . consider the solution of the following scalar equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 are @xmath87periodic functions . to define the generalized lyapunov constants , consider the solution of that for @xmath88 passes through @xmath89",
    "it may be written as @xmath90 with @xmath91 hence , the return map of this solution is given by the series @xmath92 for a given system , in order to determine the stability of a solution , the only significant term in the return map is the first nonvanishing term that makes it differ from the identity map .",
    "moreover , this term will determine the stability of this solution .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider a family of systems depending on parameters , each of the @xmath93 depends on these parameters . we will call @xmath94 generalized lyapunov constant @xmath95 the value of this expression assuming @xmath96    [ lema lyapunov ] the origin of system is monodromic , if @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , its stability if given by the sign of @xmath97 if it is not zero , and by the sign of @xmath98 if @xmath99 .    to prove that the origin is monodromic we calculate the arriving directions of the flow to the origin , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ix ) for more details .",
    "concretely if we write system in cartesian coordinates we get @xmath100 then any solutions arriving at the origin will be tangent to the directions @xmath101 that are the zeros of @xmath102 .",
    "since the lowest order term of @xmath103 is @xmath104 , which is always different from zero away from the origin , it follows that the origin is either a focus or a center .    to know the stability of the origin , we compute the two first lyapunov constants . as it is well - known ,",
    "the two first lyapunov constants of an abel equation are given by@xmath105 applying this to equation with the expressions given in we get the following result : @xmath106 and if @xmath107 , then @xmath108 and we get the result .",
    "it is clear that @xmath109 if and only if @xmath110 i.e. equation is hamiltonian ( see theorem [ teo - ham ] ) .",
    "consequently , as the origin remains being monodromic , in this case it is a center .    in the next result",
    "we study the equilibria of equation with @xmath111 .",
    "they will be the non - zero critical points of the system .",
