    "[ sec : int ] in recent years the characteristic formulation of g.r.@xcite has proven to be a valuable tool for numerical relativists . its use has enabled researchers to : study critical phenomena@xcite ; obtain the first ` unlimited ' evolutions of generic single black holes@xcite ; study accretion of matter by black holes@xcite ( via a formulation based on foliating the spacetime with incoming null hypersurfaces ) and obtain practical access to future null infinity where the gravitational radiation and other physically relevant quantities are obtained unambiguously@xcite ( via an outgoing null hypersurfaces foliation ) .",
    "these investigations adopted either an outgoing or an incoming null hypersurfaces foliation of the spacetime .",
    "regrettably , in choosing one or the other one has access to future null infinity or to the black hole interior ( as the incoming null surfaces can penetrate it but not the outgoing ! ) but not both .",
    "this , could be regarded as a drawback for the formulation as it is desirable in many cases to access both regions ; for instance , to describe a black hole accreting mass from its surrounding and the gravitational waves produced in the system .    at present , obtaining a model capable of addressing both problems at the same time requires using cauchy - characteristic matching ( ccm)@xcite or the conformal formulation of einstein s equations@xcite . unfortunately , despite much progress in both approaches neither of them is fully working in 3d .",
    "the main problem facing the ccm approach is the involved set of interpolations back and forth from a @xmath0 cartesian grid to @xmath1-spheres at the matching worldtube . on the other hand ,",
    "the conformal approach has as a drawback its large number of variables which imposes further constraints on present computer capabilities .",
    "the characteristic formulation@xcite , on the other hand , employs a minimum set of variables ( @xmath2 compared with @xmath3 in the adm equations or @xmath4 in the conformal equations ) .",
    "the success obtained with it in both formulations suggests that a combination of both could well be a natural way to study both regions .",
    "this approach , which we call `` characteristic - characteristic matching '' ( @xmath5 ) divides the spacetime in two regions .",
    "the inner region ( inside some worldtube @xmath6 ) to be studied by an incoming characteristic formulation and the outer region where and outgoing formulation will be used .",
    "interpolations are carried out at @xmath6 , however in @xmath0 it only involves two - dimensional interpolations . in a related approach , the _",
    "double null formulation_@xcite , einstein equations are also integrated along incoming and outgoing null hypersurfaces and its implementation might display similar stability properties as well .",
    "unfortunately , to date , there are no numerical implementations of this approach in 3d but studies on how to carry out such a task are under development@xcite .",
    "naturally , neither of these approaches is expected to be applicable to all situations since , for instance , the presence of caustics prevents one to use them .",
    "however , in a caustic - free foliation , @xmath5 represents an enticing proposal in light of the successful application of the characteristic formulation both in the vacuum and matter cases .",
    "we briefly describe the characteristic formulation ( both in the incoming and outgoing formulation ) in section 2 .",
    "section 3 outlines the matching strategy to be used in this work .",
    "we describe the numerical implementation in section 4 and test it in section 5 .",
    "finally we conclude with some comments and future research directions .",

    "@xmath9 results@xcite @xmath11    we introduce a coordinate system adapted to either incoming or outgoing null hypersurfaces in the following way : the outgoing ( incoming ) lightlike hypersurfaces are labeled with a parameter @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) ; each null ray on a specific hypersurface is labeled with @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 is introduced as a surface area coordinate ( i.e. surfaces at @xmath17 have area @xmath18 ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the resulting @xmath19 coordinates ,",
    "the metric takes the bondi - sachs form@xcite @xmath20 for the outgoing case , while for the incoming case : @xmath21 where in both line elements , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a unit sphere metric .",
    "note that the incoming line element , as discussed in@xcite , can be obtained from the outgoing version by the substitution @xmath25 .",
    "this fact was used in@xcite , to obtain a @xmath0 implementation of the incoming null formulation from the one constructed for the outgoing case@xcite .    in the spherically symmetric case , einstein s equations and the evolution equation for the scalar field reduce to :",
    "@xmath26 for the outgoing case , while for the incoming one , @xmath27 ( where we distinguish with a tilde the incoming fields from the outgoing ones ) .",
    "given that initial data for @xmath10 ( @xmath28 ) on an initial outgoing ( incoming ) hypersurface and at some worldtube @xmath6 consistent values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath10 are provided , the equations can be straightforwardly integrated to yield a unique solution@xcite .",
    "consistent boundary data on @xmath6 must satisfy constraint equations obtained from @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "these conditions are automatically satisfied when matching across @xmath6 to an interior ( exterior ) solution generated by the incoming ( outgoing ) evolution@xcite .",

    "consistent boundary values for the outgoing case can be obtained from the incoming variable via a coordinate transformation and viceversa . in the spherical case , obtaining this coordinate transformation is straightforward case is naturally more involved and we comment how it can be implemented in the appendix . ] .",
    "recall that the incoming line element is given by @xmath43 clearly , the transformation @xmath44 takes the incoming formulation into the outgoing one .",
    "this transformation is valid everywhere and can be used to obtain boundary values by simply using the transformation law for a 2-tensor field obtaining : @xmath45 additionally , the scalar field must be continuous across @xmath6 , so the condition @xmath46 applies . also , in order to ensure `` sheet sources '' produced by discontinuities in derivatives across @xmath6 will be not be present one might further impose @xmath47 where the superscripts @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the regions to the left and right of @xmath6 respectively and @xmath50 is an arbitrary vector at the worldtube boundary with non zero radial component .      in order to avoid",
    "dealing with singularities , we use excision to remove it from our computational domain .",
    "this technique first suggested by unruh@xcite is at present the most successful approach to handle singularities . as it is customary ,",
    "we excise from the computational domain the region inside an inner trapping boundary defined by the following . given a slice @xmath51 on an incoming null hypersurface @xmath52 described in null coordinates by @xmath53 , the divergence of the outgoing null normals is given by @xmath54_{,a }                 \\nonumber \\\\",

    ", this reduces to @xmath56 , and the divergence of the outgoing null rays results @xmath57 therefore , in our implementation we simply look for the largest @xmath58 for which @xmath59 ; for @xmath60 the field variables are not integrated and simply set to the values they have at @xmath61 . this straightforward procedure excises the singularity from the computational domain .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we introduce a compactified radial coordinate @xmath62 ( so that @xmath63 ) . defining the @xmath64 location of the worldtube by @xmath65",
    ", we introduce the outgoing radial grid as @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "analogously , we define the incoming radial grid as @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "notice that @xmath70 .",
    "hence , there is an overlapping region which will be used to interpolate from one formulation to the other in order to define boundary values .",
    "additionally , we choose @xmath71 at @xmath6 .",
    "integration of the evolution equations is done via the parallelogram approach introduced in@xcite .",
    "we here describe briefly what this method entails for the outgoing case ( it is straightforward to translate it to the incoming case so we do not expand on it ) .",
    "basically , one recognizes that equation ( [ phi_out ] ) is equivalent to @xmath72 defining @xmath73 , the previous equation can be rewritten as @xmath74 this equation corresponds to the @xmath1-dimensional wave equation in the @xmath75 plane and can be easily integrated over a null parallelogram defined by two sets of outgoing and incoming null geodesics ( see figure [ fig : last ] ) .",
    "hence , the integral identity @xmath76 can be used to integrate the scalar field up to global second order accuracy as described in@xcite .",
    "additionally , the `` hypersurface '' equations are discretized by centered second order differences yielding a global second order accurate numerical implementation .",
    "a straightforward matching implementation can be obtained by the following scheme .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath77 all field variables are known ( refer to figure 3 ) . in order to obtain starting values at the level @xmath78 one can find the intersection of the incoming null surface at @xmath79 with the outgoing null surface corresponding to @xmath80",
    ", this intersection can be easily obtained in the following way .",
    "first , consider the outgoing null ray emanating from @xmath81 ( r in figure 3 ) ; the intersection point @xmath82 of this ray with the incoming one going through at @xmath80 ( indicated by @xmath51 in figure 3 ) is obtained by requiring that @xmath83 which implies that @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the values of the fields at @xmath82 can be easily obtained by interpolation of the field on the outgoing patch .",
    "this value will be used as starting values to carry out the incoming radial integration . by proceeding in an analogous way one can get values at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 in figure [ fig : wobble ] ) which provide starting values for the radial integration on the outgoing null surface . additionally , starting values for the hypersurfaces equations",
    "are also obtained by interpolations and applying transformation ( [ transf ] ) .    to ensure continuity of the field and its radial derivatives we proceed as follows .",
    "since the intersection of the null surfaces naturally forms a null parallelogram ( see figure 3 ) , one can integrate the evolution equation for @xmath10 ( as in section 4.1 ) and obtain the value of @xmath87 ( since the values of @xmath10 at all the other corners are either known directly or can be obtained by interpolation from the values of the fields at the previous level ) .",
    "this procedure naturally ensures continuity of the field and its derivative across @xmath6 .",
    "our purpose is to present a model demonstrating the feasibility of a stable algorithm based upon two regions that cover the spacetime , where equations are expressed with respect to and incoming or outgoing characteristic formulation .",
    "the inner region is evolved using an incoming null algorithm whose inner boundary lies at the apparent horizon ( in case it exists , otherwise at @xmath88 ) and whose outer boundary @xmath89 lies beyond the inner boundary of the outer region ( located at @xmath90 ) handled by an outgoing null evolution .      as a first test , we choose initial data corresponding to a scalar wave on a flat background .",
    "the initial data for the scalar wave is described by @xmath91 @xmath92 $ } \\\\                  0 & \\mbox{otherwise }                \\end{array }",

    "the value of the field at the origin is chosen so that @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath95 was set to be small enough so that the wave would reach the origin and be dispersed away without a black hole being formed . in our runs , we choose @xmath96 and study the system for different values of @xmath95 ( with @xmath97 ) . as a test of our numerical implementation we checked that equation ( [ conservation ] ) was satisfied throughout the evolution .",
    "our results for the case @xmath98 , are illustrated in figures [ encons ] and [ sequence ] .",
    "energy conservation is satisfied and the evolution of the scalar field proceeds as expected .",
    "the pulse is originally registered at the outgoing patch ; as it travels towards the origin it crosses @xmath6 , reaches the origin and it disperses to infinity radiating all the energy contained in the initial data .",
    "the spacetime at late times is flat and all the energy of the initial pulse has been radiated away .",
    "we choose initial data corresponding to a schwarzschild black hole of mass m which is well separated from a localized pulse of ( mostly ) incoming scalar radiation .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly studied in the past by marsa and choptuik@xcite in the cauchy formulation of g.r . here , we do not try to extend their results , rather , to verify the applicability of @xmath5 .",
    "our configuration is such that , initially , there is no scalar field present on the incoming null patch , so the initial data are simply , @xmath99 on the outgoing patch we choose @xmath10 as a pulse with compact support given by ( [ compact ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath30 and @xmath29 are determined by matching at @xmath100 and integrating the hypersurface equations .",
    "inner boundary conditions are not needed since the region inside the marginally trapped surface is excised from the computational domain .    in our tests ,",
    "we choose @xmath101 , @xmath102 and again study the evolution of the system for different values of @xmath95 ( with @xmath97 ) . as an illustration",
    ", we present the results obtained with @xmath103 .",
    "as shown in figures [ encons_hole ] and [ mask_hole ] , the scalar field propagates towards the origin , part of its `` original '' energy falls into the hole which increases its mass and the rest is radiated away .",
    "the code successfully excises the hole and the area of the apparent horizon reaches an asymptotic value which agrees with twice the value of the bondi mass at late times ( see figure [ mask_hole ] )",
    ". this result fully agrees with what is expected , since at late times the spacetime must be describable by a schwarzschild metric as a consequence of the no - hair theorems .",
    "a sequence of this evolution is illustrated in figure [ seq_hole ] .",
    "another important test of the algorithm focuses on general aspects of wave propagation in a curved background .",
    "the qualitative features of the evolution are well known@xcite . in particular",
    ", a distinctive aspect of wave propagation on curve backgrounds is that huygens principle does not apply . in a non - flat spacetime , radiation backscatters giving rise to quasinormal modes and tails@xcite .",
    "notably , for a given schwarzschild potential , the power of the late - time tail is characteristic of generic compact support initial data and depends on the multipole structure of it .",
    "in particular , at future null infinity the dependence on time goes as @xmath104 ( with l the multipole index ) . in our case , @xmath105 since the initial data corresponds to a spherically symmetric pulse ; the value measured from the simulation is @xmath106 which agrees with the expected value of @xmath107 ( see figure [ tails ] ) . the results obtained here reproduce and , in a way ,",
    "expand those obtained with cauchy - characteristic matching@xcite , as in this case we dynamically find the horizon and use it to excise the hole .",
    "the behavior of the apparent horizon location gives a good indication of the energy absorbed by the black hole and its area at late times agrees with that obtained by the asymptotic value of the bondi mass .",
    "this work shows that the matching approach of two characteristic formulations provides a way of treating both the inner region and the outer region . at the inner region",
    ", it tackles the excision problem as well as other treatments like cauchy characteristic matching and purely cauchy or characteristic treatments .",
    "it has some advantages over the cauchy approach because its implementation is much simpler and computationally cheaper .",
    "its disadvantage though , is that it can not be applied in the case where caustics might be present in the integration region .",
    "additionally , it provides a means to reach future null infinity , something that only can be done with the help of a characteristic formulation or the conformal formulation of einstein s equations .",
    "this study is the first in a line of research in numerical relativity aiming to fully match characteristic codes to study matter coupled to g.r .",
    "preliminary works have shown that , where applicable , the use of a characteristic evolution can greatly help in investigating this problem . to date however , these studies have been restricted to either the incoming or outgoing formulation , thus not being able to study the inner region or obtaining physical quantities at future null infinity simultaneously .",
    "a combination of both approaches appears to be an ideal candidate since it would combine the main advantages of both directions giving access both to future null infinity and to the horizon region in a natural way .",
    "additionally , it might help `` avoid '' caustics that can be encountered using the single mapping of each formulation .",
    "just as several coordinates patches are necessary to describe nontrivial topologies , a combination of outgoing and incoming coordinates can help to obtain a smooth mapping of the manifold under study .",
    "the present work represents the first step towards achieving such a combination . at present , @xmath0 robust implementations exist for both the incoming and outgoing characteristic formulations@xcite ; further , matter treatments studied with these formulations have been successfully implemented@xcite .",
    "thus , demonstrating the feasibility of combining both approaches in @xmath108 inspired this work .",
    "future studies will address the matter case in @xmath108 ( ie . implementing the fluid equations rather than that of a massless scalar field ) and proceed with full matching in @xmath0 .",

    "the author wishes to thank pablo laguna , jeffrey winicour , philipos papadopoulos and matthew choptuik for helpful discussions , ethan honda for a careful reading of the manuscript and the national university of cordoba for its hospitality where part of this work was completed .",
    "a matching strategy for the general @xmath0 case can be devised in a way similar to the one implemented in the cauchy - characteristic matching approach . in the @xmath5 case , however , its application is simpler since no interpolation from a @xmath0 cartesian grid to @xmath109 spheres ( slices of the matching worldtube ) is required .",
    "this matching technique@xcite is straightforward .",
    "first assume that all field variables are known at hypersurfaces @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( and earlier ones ) ; that the matching worldtube is located at @xmath112 and that @xmath113 at @xmath6 .",
    "the first step which is referred to as _ extraction _ involves obtaining start - up values ( field values at the worldtube ) for the outgoing variables at @xmath114 .",
    "these values are obtained by transforming the incoming metric tensor at @xmath110 on @xmath6 to the outgoing coordinate system . instead of solving the geodesic equation to obtain this coordinate system",
    "one can proceed as follows .",
    "choose an `` affine '' coordinate system @xmath115 by @xmath116 where @xmath117 ; @xmath118 is an outgoing null vector ( normalized by @xmath119 ) and we assume the worldtube is at @xmath120 . by inspection ,",
    "equation ( [ ext_match ] ) is the solution to the geodesic equation with affine parameter @xmath121 up to second order in @xmath121 . using this transformation",
    ", one can obtain the metric in outgoing null affine coordinates by a simple tensor transformation .",
    "the final step requires obtaining @xmath16 , as its value can only be known after the angular components of the outgoing null metric are obtained , ( refer to@xcite for further details ) . with these values",
    ", one can integrate einstein s equation and completely determine the field values on @xmath114 .",
    "the second step , referred to as _ injection _ requires us to obtain the field values at the intersection of @xmath122 with @xmath114 .",
    "this intersection can be obtained up to second order accuracy by means of equation ( [ ext_match ] ) , since @xmath123 from which we can deduce the value of @xmath124 .",
    "thus , since the values of the fields are known everywhere on @xmath114 , we can interpolate to obtain the values of the outgoing fields at the intersection point .",
    "finally , by means of the transformation ( [ ext_match ] ) , the values of the incoming fields are obtained with which one can integrate the equations inward ."
