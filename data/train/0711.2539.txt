    "recently , a large class of manganese oxides ( rmno@xmath7 , @xcite and rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xcite with r = y , tb , dy , etc . ) has been discovered to be multiferroic , with strong magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling .",
    "the me coupling leads to various novel physical effects , such as the `` colossal magnetodielectric '' ( cmd ) effects and magneto - spin - flop effects .",
    "@xcite for example , in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite the me coupling is so strong , that the electric polarization can be reversed by applying a magnetic field . @xcite the remarkable me effects revealed in these materials have attracted great attention @xcite because of the fascinating physics and their potential applications in novel multifunctional me devices .",
    "the crystal structure of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is orthorhombic , with four chemical formula units per primitive cell ( 32 atoms in total ) , containing mn@xmath8o@xmath9 octahedra and mn@xmath10o@xmath1 pyramids , as shown in fig.[fig : structure ] .",
    "tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 shows several magnetic phase transitions accompanied with the appearance of electric polarizations and dielectric anomalies , when cooling down from the room temperature .",
    "@xcite starting from an incommensurate antimagnetic ( icm ) ordering at @xmath11 = 43k with a propagation vector @xmath12 ( @xmath130.50 , 0 , 0.30 ) , the structure locks into commensurate antimagnetic ( cm ) state at @xmath14 = 33k with @xmath15=(0.5 , 0 , 0.25 ) , during which spontaneous polarization arises at @xmath16 = 38k .",
    "@xcite when the temperature lowers to @xmath17 = 24 k , magnetic order becomes icm again , with a sudden decrease of polarization and a jump of the @xmath15 vector to ( 0.48 , 0 , 0.32 ) .",
    "the spontaneous polarization increase again , when continuing to cool to about 10k .",
    "@xcite during the magnetic phase transitions , a peak at @xmath16 and a step at @xmath17 of the dielectric constant was observed,@xcite indicating strong me coupling in this compound .",
    "it was demonstrated the electric polarization can be reversed by applying magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    experimental data show that the structure of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 has space group _ pbam _ , @xcite which includes spatial inversion ( @xmath18 ) symmetry .",
    "it is therefore puzzling that the material can develop spontaneous electric polarizations .",
    "it has been suspected @xcite that the actual symmetry group of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is _ _",
    "pb__2@xmath19__m _ _ , allowing polarization along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "indeed , there are several experiments supporting this hypnosis .",
    "@xcite for example , some raman modes were found to be ir active in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xcite and the anomalies of atomic displacement parameters ( adp ) have been observed.@xcite nevertheless , no _ direct _ evidence of the lower symmetry has yet been found .",
    "@xcite    theoretically , the microscopic origin of the strong me coupling and the electric polarization is still under intensive debates .",
    "@xcite the me coupling could originate either from the symmetric superexchange interactions , or from the antisymmetric exchange interactions .",
    "@xcite the antisymmetric exchange comes from the spin - orbit coupling , and the noncollinearity of the spin structure is an essential ingredient for this mechanism .",
    "@xcite however it was shown in ref . that the largest electric polarization in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is associated with the cm state that is almost collinear .",
    "@xcite in our recent work , @xcite we determined the ground - state structure of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 using the first - principles methods .",
    "the results show that the ground - state structure is indeed of polar space group @xmath2 and the electric polarization equals @xmath4 @xmath5@xmath6 . in the calculations , we use collinear spin approximation and ignore the spin - orbit interaction , suggesting that me coupling in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is due to the symmetric superexchange interactions .    the aim of the present work to examine rigorously the ground state structural , electronic and lattice dielectric properties of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 using first - principles calculations to provide solid ground for further investigations .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . after a brief discussion of the first - principles methods and the approximations used in the calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : methodology ] , we provide a detailed analysis of the ground - state structural and electronic properties in sec . [",
    "sec : structure ] , [ sec : e_structure ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phonon ] , we calculate all zone center optical phonon frequencies and the oscillator strengths of ir modes .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the known experimental ir and raman spectra . in sec .",
    "[ sec : polarization ] , we calculate electric polarization in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 . we then derive an effective hamiltonian to explain the microscopic mechanisms of the ferroelectricity and the giant magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "our calculations are based on the standard density - functional ( dft ) theory with spin - polarized generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "we adopt perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional@xcite implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _",
    "simulations package ( vasp ) .",
    "@xcite a plane - wave basis and projector augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite are used , with mn 3__p__3__d__4__s _ _ , and tb 5__p__5__d__6__s _ _ electrons treated self - consistently .",
    "a 500 ev plane - wave cutoff results in good convergence of the total energies .",
    "we relax the structure until the changes of total energy in the self - consistent calculations are less than 10@xmath20 ev , and the remaining forces are less than 1 mev /  .",
    "experimentally , tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 is found to be incommensurate anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) below 24 k , with the propagation vector @xmath21 . to accommodate the magnetic structure",
    ", one needs a huge supercell , which is computationally prohibitive .",
    "instead , we use a 2@xmath221@xmath221 supercell , equivalent to approximating the propagation vector @xmath23 .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been justified in our previous work .",
    "@xcite for the supercell we used , a @xmath24 monkhorst - pack k - points mesh converges very well the results .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref . that the largest electric polarization is associated with a commensurate magnetic ( cm ) state that is almost collinear .",
    "@xcite therefore , in the calculations , we use the collinear spin approximation and ignore the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our results agree very well with the known experiments , indicating that these approximations capture the essential physics in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    ".the calculated lattice constants compared with experimental data .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the structures of spin configurations @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinconfigurations ] , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : diff_js ]",
    "in this appendix , we discuss in more details about the magnetic structures of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 and the ( super)exchange interactions @xmath29s .",
    "@xcite to determine the @xmath29s , we calculate the total energies of eight scs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinconfigurations ] , under the fixed _",
    "high _ symmetry structure @xmath30 .",
    "the total energies of these scs are listed in table [ tab : diff_js ] , among which sc @xmath28 has the lowest total energy .",
    "we then use a heisenberg model with nn interaction , @xmath31 to fit @xmath29s and to check whether the @xmath28 is indeed the the ground state sc . here , @xmath32 is the spin of the @xmath33-th mn ion and @xmath34 denotes the exchange integral between two nn @xmath33-th and @xmath35-th atoms .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fitted using four afm scs , and the results are listed in table [ tab : diff_js ] . since @xmath39 and @xmath40 is not relevant here , they are not fitted .",
    "we calculate the total energies of the four fm scs from eq.([eq : heisenbergmodel ] ) .",
    "these results are in reasonable good agreement with the first - principles calculations , suggesting that the heisenberg model is valid even in the fm phase when applied to tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 . from table [",
    "tab : diff_js ] , we find all the three exchange integrals are negative , i.e. , of afm type , and @xmath41 . therefore the ground state sc are mainly determined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to see that sc @xmath28 ( and @xmath42 ) indeed has the lowest energy in this model .    in both scs @xmath28 and @xmath42 , mn@xmath8 form an afm square lattice in the @xmath43 plane , whereas mn@xmath10 couples to mn@xmath8 either antiferromagnetically via @xmath37 along the @xmath27 axis or with alternating sign via @xmath36 along the @xmath3 axis . the zigzag chains along the @xmath3 axis can be simplified as mn@xmath10-mn@xmath8-mn@xmath10 segments linked via @xmath38 superexchange interactions . inside the segments mn@xmath10 and mn@xmath8 interact through superexchange @xmath36 , whereas the chains couple to each other through @xmath37 .",
    "the afm chains along the @xmath27 axis are of two types , labeled as i and ii respectively in fig .",
    "[ fig : chains ] .",
    "adjacent chains i and ii along the @xmath3 axis couple to each other via @xmath36 , in which half of them are frustrated .",
    "the scs @xmath28 and @xmath42 have several energetically degenerate scs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chains ] .",
    "there are two relative positions between chain i and ii , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "`` @xmath44 '' ( `` @xmath45 '' ) means that the mn@xmath8 ions in chain i have the same spins to the mn@xmath8 ions on their _ left _",
    "( _ right _ ) side in chain ii in each unit cell .",
    "figure [ fig : chains ] shows 4 different combinations of chains i and ii . figure [ fig : chains](a ) and ( b ) are the ground sc @xmath28 and @xmath42 respectively , whereas fig.[fig : chains](c ) and ( d ) are in fact two domain wall structures @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the two domain walls are energetically degenerate to @xmath28 and @xmath42 in the nn heisenberg model , because the @xmath36 exchange interactions between chain i and ii cancel out no matter what their relative positions are .",
    "however , after turning on the spin - lattice coupling , the crystal structure @xmath30 will relax to @xmath26 or @xmath48 , and the energy degeneracy between the domain wall structures ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) to scs @xmath28 and @xmath42 will be lifted ."
