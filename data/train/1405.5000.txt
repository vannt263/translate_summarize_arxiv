    "the prices of crude oil are driven by the supply / demand imbalance and the uncertainty of this imbalance which causes increased speculations @xcite .",
    "there is huge literature devoting to the study of the dynamics of crude oil prices and their mutual relationships .",
    "a considerable portion of the literature focuses on the co - movement and convergence of oil prices at different regions .",
    "@xcite asserts that the global market of crude oils is unified as `` one great pool '' .",
    "conversely , @xcite argues that the crude oil markets are regionalized which challenges the `` one great pool '' hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "these two competing hypotheses have stimulated many debates and extensive studies @xcite .",
    "the majority of empirical studies support the `` one great pool '' hypothesis . in this line ,",
    "different econometric methods have been adopted and different `` definitions '' of market unification have been implicitly assumed .",
    "@xcite incorporates cointegration relationships into multivariate time series models to examine the extent of regionalization in the global market for crude oil imports and finds that the empirical results support @xcite s `` one great pool '' assertion .",
    "@xcite performs cointegration tests for co - movement of monthly and weekly prices on three groups of crude oil of similar quality and finds that the world crude oil market is unified over the 1980 - 95 period , rejecting the regionalization hypothesis .",
    "@xcite finds bidirectional causality among these major crude oil prices ( opec , brent and wti ) and argues that the regionalization hypothesis of the global oil market is thus rejected .",
    "@xcite investigates the dynamics of crude oil price differentials using the two - regime threshold autoregressive ( tar ) method of @xcite and finds strong evidence of threshold effects in the adjustment process to the long - run equilibrium .",
    "since the crude oil prices are linked , @xcite argues that the oil market is `` one great pool '' at the very general level .",
    "@xcite examines the dependence structure between crude oil benchmark prices using copulas and finds evidence of significant symmetric upper and lower tail dependence between crude oil prices .",
    "he states that crude oil prices are linked with the same intensity during bull and bear markets , thus favoring the `` one great pool '' hypothesis over the regionalization hypothesis .",
    "@xcite argue there is no room for innovations in world oil prices to enter the market if the world oil market is unified and there would be no causal relationships between prices for different crude oils .",
    "they point out that changes may first appear in the price of one or more benchmark crude oils and subsequently spread through the global market .",
    "they find evidence of granger causality from benchmark markers to other crude oil markets .",
    "@xcite study the monthly energy prices of four energy products for 83 russian regions using the exponential smooth auto - regressive augmented dickey - fuller unit root test and find no evidence of a fully integrated national energy market in russia .",
    "@xcite examine the regionalization issue by investigating the integration between china s and four major crude oil markets with a threshold error correction model and find only unidirectional volatility spillover running from benchmark markets to china s oil market .",

    "our work contributes to this literature by uncovering the correlation structure of the global crude oil market with principal component analysis @xcite and random matrix theory @xcite .",

    "random matrix theory has been applied extensively in studying multiple financial time series @xcite .",
    "random matrix theory is in essence equivalent to principal component analysis because both of them deal with the correlation matrix and its eigenvalues . under the framework of random matrix theory ,",
    "if the eigenvalues of the real time series differ from the prediction of random matrix theory , there must exist hidden economic information in those deviating eigenvalues . for stock markets , there are several deviating eigenvalues in which the largest eigenvalue reflects a collective effect of the whole market and other largest eigenvalues can be used to identify industrial sectors @xcite or clusters of stocks with strong cross - correlations @xcite .",
    "different information can be extracted for housing markets @xcite and global stock markets @xcite .",
    "such kind of analysis enables us to uncover market driving forces @xcite as well as mutual and common influence @xcite .",
    "we apply principal component analysis and random matrix theory to investigate the correlation structure of the global crude oil market by using 71 spot price time series from different countries .",
    "we are able to identify six clusters of oil price time series that have clear geographic traits .",
    "this finding supports the regionalization hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "we also extract rich economic information from the deviating eigenvalues , suggesting that the global crude oil market has a very distinct correlation structure . this rest of this paper",

    "these crude oil price time series differ in several aspects .",
    "the oil markets may locate in different countries or regions including the main crude oil export countries such as iran and saudi arab or different places in a country .",
    "particularly , some oil price series are recorded according to their different crude oil qualities ( including density and sulfur content ) . for the original data , we intersect them and then complement price of the missing data same as that of the previous day .",
    "if data of the previous day is still missing , we complement them with that of the day before previous day , the rest is done in the same manner .",

    "abnormally large price fluctuations ( @xmath8 ) are removed .",

    "table [ tb : oil : datasets ] presents the summary statistics of the daily returns for each time series . usually , if the maximum return ( max ) is large if the absolute minimum return ( min ) is large for a time series .",

    "the time series of the average returns evidently exhibits the volatility clustering phenomenon .",

    "following the idea of @xcite and @xcite , we combine the box clustering algorithm of @xcite and the consensus clustering method of @xcite to search for clusters of crude oil time series .    we first determine the optimal ordering of @xmath22 by identifying the largest elements in @xmath22 close to the backward diagonal @xmath23 , where the simulated annealing approach is adopted to minimize the cost function @xmath24 we then use a greedy algorithm to partition clusters of time series @xcite .",

    "we found that the distribution of correlation coefficients between pairs of daily returns is not unimodal , but multi - modal .",
    "we also identified six clusters of price time series from the correlation matrix , which have evident geographical traits .",
    "the multi - modality of the correlation coefficient distribution is caused by the geographical traits of the price time series and the peaks correspond well to the distinct intra - cluster and inter - cluster correlations .",
    "we found that most eigenvalues of the correlation matrix locate outside the prediction of the random matrix theory , where the five largest eigenvalues are greater than the theoretical maximal eigenvalue @xmath56 and 64 small eigenvalues are less than the theoretical minimal eigenvalue @xmath57 .",
    "we showed these deviating eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors embed certain economic information .",
    "specifically , the largest eigenvalue reflects a collective effect of the global market , other four largest eigenvalues bear geographical information that is capable of identifying the six clusters , and the smallest eigenvalues usually have very large components in the eigenvectors which corresponds to pairs of time series with the largest correlation coefficients in the correlation matrix .",
    "we constructed eigenportfolios based on the eigenvectors .",
    "it is found that the returns of the eigenportfolio for the largest eigenvalue correlate strongly to the average returns of the oil prices , while other eigenportfolios do not exhibit significant correlations with the average returns .",
    "inspired by this feature , we proposed to construct an index for the global crude oil market based on the eigenportfolio of the largest eigenvalue .",
    "this index evolves very similarly to the average price time series and outperforms the latter under the buy - and - hold strategy .",
