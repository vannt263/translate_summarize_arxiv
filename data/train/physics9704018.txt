    "motion at any speed can be studied without a need for transforming between objects in relative motion , using information from the space - time metric equation itself concerning the rate at which moving clocks slow with respect to fixed clocks , if simultaneity and distances are considered only with respect to a single inertial reference ( or `` map '' ) frame .",
    "this works without the need for transforming , since choosing a map - frame unambiguously defines both distances between objects , and simultaneity between events : two things which relativity has shown to be frame - dependent .",
    "this approach was not used in early papers @xcite , perhaps because an early inspiration for the ideas was the postulate that light recognizes no physically - special frame - of - motion .",
    "however , when the focus turns to solving problems , it is a good idea @xcite to select a convenient , if otherwise arbitrary , frame of reference for drawing maps and evaluating variables .",
    "for example , when mapping the solar system we might choose a map - frame at rest with respect to the sun , or the solar system s center of mass .",
    "likewise , general relativistic `` embedding diagrams '' of space - time curvature require a selected frame of motion as well @xcite . merely specifying a momentum or",
    "a kinetic energy requires the same .",
    "once this choice is made , the metric equation allows us to draw out predictions for any motions that we wish , and to express the results concretely in terms of map - position , and time - elapsed on the traveler and map clocks .",
    "moreover , by choosing the motion of interest to involve constant acceleration `` felt '' by the traveling object of interest , we find that newton s second law at high speed breaks into two integrals , one for time - elapsed on traveler clocks , and a second one ( related to momentum conservation ) for time - elapsed on the map .",
    "a work - energy relation very similar to the classical one also emerges , as does a way to put galileo s geometrically - derived equations for constant acceleration to use at any speed .",
    "this conceptual approach is of special interest for engineering physics .",
    "for example workers taught to specify the clock whenever discussing elapsed times can then confidently deal with motions at any speed , concretely in context of any user - specified reference frame @xcite , and in that context a velocity - dependent and frame - invariant force law predicts electric and magnetic forces as one",
    ". the contrasting origins of gravity in curvature - related proper - acceleration may be easier to see as well .",
    "first , a word about notation .",
    "many of the relationships we discuss here are easy to see in 4-vector form .",
    "in fact , a set of 4-vector equations for motion under constant proper acceleration has been consulted often in the writing of this paper .",
    "however the objective is to make calculations involving motion at any speed as concrete as possible .",
    "our strategy is based deeply in the metric , but is explicitly frame - dependent rather than coordinate - free .",
    "although space - time symmetries are somewhat hidden as a result , the approach is useful because our _ view of the world _ is inherently frame - specific .",
    "thus we experience time differently than we do space , clocks and meter - sticks are constructed differently , and the equations used by scientists and engineers solving practical relativistic problems will likely distinguish between units for distance and time .",
    "hence the spirit of what follows .      because the focus is on motion at any speed , but not on relative motion , we begin with the metric equation rather than with lorentz transforms or postulates about light .",
    "a teacher might , for example , begin by saying :  to understand how magnetism results from electric currents in neutral wires , and how lightspeed avoids dependence on the earth s direction of travel , einstein postulated @xcite ( in terms introduced by minkowski along the road toward general relativity @xcite ) that the time @xmath0 elapsed on the clocks of a traveler relates to the time and position changes ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) seen by map - based observers via the pythagoras - like metric equation :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the speed of light .",
    " we say here that this equation constitutes the `` kinematical assumption '' in flat space - time .    for each of the two times in this equation , we define two velocities or time - derivatives of _ position on the map_. the derivative with respect to _ map - time _ is the usual _ coordinate - velocity _ @xmath5 , while the derivative with respect to _ traveler - time _ is called _ proper - velocity _ @xmath6 [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is easy from the metric equation to show that the @xmath7 at which map - time changes per unit traveler - time , or in other words the `` _ speed - of - map - time _ '' @xmath8 if we define simultaneity from the perspective of the map - frame , is simply :    @xmath9    the above variable definitions take steps toward making application of the integrals of accelerated motion , to be discussed in the next section , as simple and concrete as possible .    also relevant to our choice of variables",
    "is the `` dynamical assumption '' .",
    "one might describe this simply by saying :  einstein further noted that an object of mass @xmath10 may then have a rest - energy @xmath11 , related to total energy @xmath12 ( kinetic plus rest ) and momentum @xmath13 by the relation    @xmath14    this relation follows by multiplying the metric equation above by @xmath15 and dividing by @xmath0 twice , if one postulates that the quantities momentum @xmath16 and total energy @xmath17 are conserved in all isolated interactions .",
    "this dynamical assumption has of course been shown to work very well in practice .      for describing motion at any speed ,",
    "we introduce three other classes of variables : a pair of velocity functions , a pair of accelerations , and the `` galilean - kinematic '' velocity / time pair .",
    "the first velocity function is the _ parallel - rapidity _ ( or hyperbolic velocity - angle ) @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this operates on @xmath19 , the component of proper - velocity _ in _ the direction of coordinate - acceleration .",
    "the second velocity - component function might be called `` _ gamma - perp _ '' , and is defined as @xmath20 .",
    "this operates on that component of coordinate - velocity , namely @xmath21 or `` v - perp '' , which is _ orthogonal to _ the direction of coordinate - acceleration .",
    "this quantity is that part of the speed - of - map - time @xmath22 that _ would result _ from only the component of coordinate - velocity perpendicular to the direction of velocity change . because @xmath23 depends entirely on the velocity - component perpendicular to the direction of velocity - change , it will be constant iff the _ direction _ of acceleration is constant . also note that when the motion is uni - directional ( e.g. in 1 + 1d special relativity ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and we can define rapidity @xmath26 $ ] .    concerning accelerations , _",
    "coordinate - acceleration _",
    "@xmath27 is the only acceleration discussed in classical descriptions of motion @xcite .",
    "given two times to keep track of , one might also consider proper , and mixed , time derivatives of coordinate position . as we show later , however , of most use is the frame - invariant acceleration `` felt '' by the traveler , i.e. the _ proper - acceleration _",
    "this acceleration is not the second time - derivative of position with respect to either map or traveler time !",
    "rather , it s magnitude is the rate at which parallel rapidity changes per unit traveler - time ( @xmath28 ) , while its vector relation to coordinate - acceleration is : @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this acceleration enters directly into integrals of the motion involving the conserved quantities energy and momentum , as we will see , and hence is the acceleration most deeply connected to the dynamics of motion .",
    "the last set of variables are the `` galilean - kinematic '' time - velocity pair .",
    "these are based on the behavior of physical clocks in a chase - plane , whose velocity is linked to that of our traveler so that proper - acceleration is the second derivative of traveler - position on the map , with respect to chase - plane time . if we use @xmath30 to denote time on the clocks of such a chase plane , and @xmath31 to denote the rate of change of map - position for our traveler per unit time on chase - plane clocks , then we require that @xmath32 .",
    "this `` galilean - kinematic '' velocity @xmath33 , like proper - velocity @xmath34 , involves the rate of change of a traveler s position , with respect to landmarks and meter - sticks at rest in a map - frame , per unit time on clocks not stationary in that map frame .",
    "these `` non - coordinate '' velocities are examples of the infinite set of such physical non - coordinate velocities which may be used to monitor the motion of objects on reference - frame maps . the requirement above , for proper - acceleration as a second - derivative of map - position , is met for the clocks in a chase - plane traveling with total velocity @xmath35 , and with perpendicular component matching the traveler ( i.e. @xmath36 ) @xcite . here",
    "primed quantities refer to chase - plane motion with respect to the map - frame , while unprimed quantities refer to traveler motion in the map - frame , as described above .",
    "one can show that the motion of this chase - plane is intermediate to that of traveler and map , so that in the classical limit when differences in traveler and map time are negligible , these chase - plane equations provide an accurate and simple approximation : namely the approximation discovered by galileo well before newton s birth @xcite .",
    "remarkably , they also provide an accurate description of motion _ at any speed _ on a reference - frame map , monitored with clocks in the chase - plane defined here !",
    "it may be helpful to summarize the foregoing kinematic relations between parameters related to velocity with a single string of equalities .",
    "if we use @xmath8 @xmath37 as the dependent quantity ( since it is the one `` velocity parameter '' which discards sign information ) , we can add terms for parallel - rapidity and galilean - velocity to the equality string in equation [ gamma ] : @xmath38 = \\gamma _ { \\perp } \\left ( 1+% % tcimacro{\\tfrac 12 } % beginexpansion { \\textstyle { 1 \\over 2 } } % endexpansion \\left (   % tcimacro{\\tfrac vc } % beginexpansion { \\textstyle { v \\over c } } % endexpansion \\right ) ^2\\right ) \\text{. }   \\label{g3string}\\ ] ] for the special case of unidirectional motion , the @xmath8 string simplifies to @xmath39 = 1+% % tcimacro{\\tfrac 12 } % beginexpansion { \\textstyle { 1 \\over 2 } } % endexpansion \\left (   % tcimacro{\\tfrac vc } % beginexpansion { \\textstyle { v \\over c } } % endexpansion \\right ) ^2\\text{. }   \\label{g1string}\\ ] ] except for the above - mentioned information on velocity sign , these strings contain all of the information on velocity inter - conversions needed for the solution of constant acceleration problems at any speed .",
    "conversions in closed form , which preserve the sign - information , follow directly as well .",
    "as h. minkowski suggests @xcite , the metric equation alone is adequate to derive the integrals of motion under constant accelerations of any type , just as integrals of motion in the classical limit follow from the kinematic connection between acceleration , velocity , position , and time there as well @xcite .",
    "the dynamics , which of course tie the metric equation into applications , concern not these integrals themselves , but rather the way that some variables are conserved when objects interact .",
    "for example , in classical kinematics , the time ( or momentum ) integral , namely @xmath40 , and the distance ( or work - energy ) integral , namely @xmath41 , both follow from our definitions of velocity , acceleration , and the @xmath42 metric association between time and distance alone .",
    "the dynamical usefulness of the equations , however , only becomes clear when we associate @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the conserved quantities momentum , and energy , respectively .",
    "similarly , in the case of flat space - time , one can derive integrals of any type of acceleration using kinematical assumptions ( i.e. the metric equation ) alone . because of our occupation with quantities conserved in dynamical interaction , integrals of constant coordinate - acceleration are of little interest @xcite .",
    "integrals of constant frame - invariant `` felt '' ( i.e. proper ) acceleration are , therefore , the focus here .      before considering integrals of the motion for constant proper - acceleration @xmath45 ,",
    "let s review the classical integrals of motion for constant coordinate - acceleration @xmath46 .",
    "these can be written as @xmath47 .",
    "the first of these is associated with conservation of momentum in the absence of acceleration , and the second with the work - energy theorem .",
    "these may look more familiar in the form @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .    given the variables introduced above , four simple integrals of the proper acceleration can be obtained by a procedure which works for integrating other non - coordinate velocity / time expressions as well @xcite .",
    "the resulting integrals are summarized in compact form , like the classical ones in the pargraph above , as    @xmath50    note that both @xmath21 and the `` transverse time - speed '' @xmath51 are constants .",
    "hence proper - velocity and longitudinal momentum @xmath52 change uniformly with map - time , parallel rapidity ( and impulse delivered from the traveler s view ) change uniformly with traveler - time , energy @xmath17 changes at a uniform rate with increase in map - distance , and galilean - kinematic velocity changes uniformly with increase in chase - plane time .    using these equations",
    ", one can solve constant acceleration problems at any speed , and can examine the quantitative behavior of any of the velocities and accelerations , as well as their relationship to dynamical quantities like momentum and energy .",
    "we draw out some of these relationships in the last section of this paper , where we attempt a practical summary which at the same time mirrors underlying relationships .",
    "if motion is only in the direction of acceleration , @xmath23 is 1 , and the above integrals simplify to :    @xmath53    this string of equalities , in combination with the velocity inter - conversions in the previous section , provide equations for solving uni - directional constant acceleration problems at any speed",
    ".    one might consider 11 variables at the heart of _ any _ uni - directional problem to be the frame - invariant acceleration @xmath54 , the map - distance traveled @xmath55 , elapsed - times in context of map , traveler , and/or chase - plane clocks ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , and initial and final velocities expressed inter - changably as coordinate - velocities ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , proper - velocities ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , or galilean - kinematic velocities ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "only three of these variables can be specified independently .",
    "because of the interchangability of velocity types , this leaves us with 25 types of independent variable assignments , 3 of which involve no elapsed - times given , 12 of which involve only a single given elapsed - time , 9 of which involve two given elapsed - times , and the last of which involves all three elapsed - times as input .",
    "although none of these problems is difficult to solve numerically , we have yet to identify closed - form solutions to one of the 12 single - time problem types , and 9 of the 10 which involve more than one input time - elapsed .",
    "in what follows , we summarize the consequences of these observations in a form designed to highlight their physical meaning for motion in flat space - time . the equivalence principle for curved space - times",
    ", however , as well as the frame - invariance of many of the quantities used , extends their range of applicability considerably .",
    "the first three items in the resulting list of `` rules '' shows similarities with newton s three laws of motion @xcite , reflecting elements of newton s world that survive even at high speeds . unlike newton s laws , the items here are not all in the form of postulates .",
    "rather , the kinematic postulate is introduced in i ( before rates of change of velocity are considered ) , and some of its consequences when considering rates of velocity change are ennumerated in ii , and vii .",
    "the postulate of momentum conservation is introduced in iii , with some of its consequences at high speed ennumerated in iv .",
    "lastly , the postulate of energy conservation ( which maxwell and others said was implicit in newton s laws as well @xcite ) is introduced explicitly in v , with some consequences drawn out in vi .    the only quantity from above not redefined in any one place below , perhaps because it is useful in so many places , is `` gamma - perp '' @xmath65 , i.e. the `` speed - of - map - time '' that would result from the component of coordinate - velocity perpendicular to the direction of velocity change , taken alone .",
    "we should also add that assigning colors according to frame - invariance ( e.g. red : variant at all speeds ; green : variant only at high speeds ; blue : invariant ) can be an enlightening exercise .",
    "* i. * * motion without forces : * in the absence of external forces , objects follow geodesics in space - time . for the special case of the flat metric , this means that an object at rest continues at rest , and an object in motion continues in motion .",
    "when one defines time measurements ( hence simultaneity ) and _ all _ distances used from the perspective of a single `` map '' frame , this means that such objects ( or travelers ) have constant _ coordinate - velocity _ @xmath66 , constant _ proper - velocity _ @xmath6 , and a constant rate @xmath67 at which _ map - time _",
    "@xmath68 changes per unit time @xmath69 on object ( or traveler ) clocks .    *",
    "the proper - time / impulse integral : * the invariant force @xmath70 _ felt _ by an accelerated object may be obtained by multiplying that object s proper - acceleration @xmath71 by its rest - mass @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "this _ proper - acceleration _",
    "@xmath71 is in the direction of the object s coordinate - acceleration @xmath73 .",
    "its invariant magnitude is lightspeed @xmath4 times the rate that the _ parallel - rapidity _ , or hyperbolic arcsine of the unit - free proper - velocity in the direction of that acceleration , changes per unit time @xmath69 on the clocks of the object , i.e. @xmath74 , where @xmath75=\\tanh ^{-1}[\\gamma _ { \\perp } \\frac{v_{\\parallel } } c]=\\cosh ^{-1}[\\frac   \\gamma { \\gamma _ { \\perp } } ] $ ] .    _ aside : _ at rest on the earth , all objects experience acceleration against the gravitational curvature of space - time , directed toward center of our planet .",
    "the way this curvature arises from the web of interaction with participating masses is in general a matter for the mathematics of general relativity , although calculus can go a long way toward drawing out its consequences in simple situations @xcite .",
    "regardless of this , rule * ii * ( with a bit of help from the equivalence principle ) says that such acceleration gives rise to a proper - force proportional to the mass @xmath10 of the object involved .",
    "the way in which forces combine from any vantage point , and hence their dynamical consequences , is best treated from a specific frame of reference .",
    "the next 4 rules do this , thus offering and implementing separate `` map - based '' rules for momentum and energy conservation from any inertial point of view .",
    "as we mentioned above in discussing differences between the classical ( low - speed ) rules and `` map - based '' rules that work at any speed : just as classical time must be separated into map - time and traveler - time , so the classical 2nd law @xcite separates into the proper - time integral of rule * ii * here , and a map - time integral associated with conservation of momentum in rule * iv*. conservation of energy ( whose explicit treatment developed more fully _ after _",

    "namely : @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "since chase - plane motion parallel to the acceleration - direction is intermediate to that of object and map - frame , at speeds low enough to make elapsed - times for object and map similar , these equations predict the behavior of their clocks , and parallel velocity components as well .",

    "@xmath92-perp can be calculated from @xmath34-transverse , and vice - versa , since :    @xmath108",
    "lastly , both the magnitude and direction of proper - force @xmath70 can be given in terms of transverse and longitudinal unit vectors @xmath109 and @xmath110 oriented with respect to the variant - force @xmath111 .",

    "this single equation thus describes electricity and magnetism _ from any point of view _",
    ", with the caveat of course that the independent variables are written here in terms of distances measured in the rest frame of the charge .    we can be more specific in 4-vector terms by pointing out that the variant - force is associated with a 4-vector potential which for our charge has components @xmath120 @xmath121 .",

    ", the 4-vector potential will be rotated so as to have space - like components .",
    "thus the charge @xmath116 will exhibit a magnetic field , even though its variant and proper - forces are both purely coulombic in nature .",
    "it is easy to see that these equations allow us to predict a velocity - dependent proper - force , and spacelike components to the vector potential when seen from a moving frame , whenever the variant - force is a function solely of position while the agent of that force is at rest .",

    "for example , the preferred frame for measuring the length of an object is the frame in which that object is at rest . using the notation of this paper , we list in table i some other preferences that follow naturally , whenever a problem involving motion at high speeds is defined .",
    "we have not considered rotational motion in this context , but expect that a `` map - based '' approach adaptable to motion at arbitrary speeds may be useful there as well .",
    "perhaps the rate of change _ per unit traveler - time _ of map - based angle will assume an analogous role to that of proper - velocity here .    because the `` map - based '' rules described here stem directly from the metric equation",
    ", they may be useful in non - flat space - time applications .",
    "for example , given that we can describe the electromagnetic force in frame - invariant form , a direct comparison to the proper - force expression for schwarzchild - metric gravity should be instructive and understandable by students .",
    "moreover , telling them that we can get gravity on earth by a part - per - billion error in the space - time version of pythagoras theorem should pique their interest in figuring out how as well !",
    "results of the distinctions drawn here are hardly beyond everyday experience : we go through life on earth experiencing a downward _ proper - acceleration _ ,",
    "applied to each part of our being , whose consequences must be cancelled by an upward _ frame - variant _ force , applied to the soles of our feet if we wish to stand and not fall .    for curved - space situations in which moving masses",
    "are sufficiently small that we can consider metric coefficients to result only from masses fixed with respect to a system of locally - inertial map - frames , some possible `` test - mass '' trajectories might yield themselves to closed - form solution .",
    "such trajectory solutions , in the spirit of taylor and wheeler @xcite , could provide students with another quantitative calculus - based handle on experiences associated with curved space - time .    my thanks for input relevant to this paper from w. a. shurcliff , e. f. taylor , and a. a. ungar . the work has benefited indirectly from support by the u.s .",
