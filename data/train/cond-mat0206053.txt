    "when considering the properties of real systems with strongly correlated electrons , such as transition metal ( tm ) oxides , one often has to take into account , besides the charge and spin degrees of freedom , described e.g. by the nondegenerate hubbard model , also the orbital structure of corresponding tm ions .",
    "these orbital degrees of freedom are especially important in cases of the so - called orbital degeneracy the situation when the orbital state of the tm ions in a regular , undistorted coordination ( e.g.  in a regular @xmath1-octahedron ) turns out to be degenerate  @xcite .",
    "this is e.g. the situation with the ions cu@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , mn@xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) , cr@xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) , low - spin ni@xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) . in an isolated centre",
    "this degeneracy gives rise to the famous jahn - teller effect  @xcite , and in concentrated systems to a cooperative transition which may be viewed as a simultaneous structural phase transition that lifts the orbital degeneracy ( cooperative jahn - teller transition ) and orbital ordering ( oo ) transition ( or quadrupolar ordering transition , a terminology that is often used in rare earth compounds ) .",
    "all these effects play a very important role in the materials which became very popular recently in manganites with colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "a typical example is the system la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 ( there may be other rare earths , e.g. pr , nd , or bi instead of la , or other divalent cations sr , ba , pb instead of ca ; there exist also layered materials of this kind ) .",
    "the characteristic phase diagram of these systems is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the undoped material lamno@xmath8 , which is an antiferromagnetic insulator , contains typical jahn - teller ions mn@xmath0 ( electronic configuration @xmath9 ) i.e .",
    "it is orbitally doubly - degenerate , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dlevels ] .",
    "thus we can expect that the orbital degrees of freedom may significantly influence the properties of cmr manganites an idea which is largely supported by experiments . in this paper",
    "we review some of the aspects of the physics of manganites connected with orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "this field is actually already quite large and well developed , and of course we will not be able to cover all of it ; much of the material presented will be based on the investigations in which we ourselves participated .",
    "some of the general concepts used below are also presented in  @xcite .",
    "there are a lot of different questions , and a wealth of properities ( see the phase diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] ) in which orbitals are important . in this chapter",
    "we give a general overview of these properties .",
    "most topics we will discuss on a rather qualitative level , trying to explain the main physical effects , but without going into too many details . however , there are some very interesting and important problems in the orbital physics of manganites , which require a more detailed explanation .",
    "this , in particular , is the case with genuine quantum effects which may be very important , especially ( but not only ) in the `` optimal doped '' ferromagnetic metallic phase .",
    "these questions are treated in section  [ sec : quantum ] in more detail and on a somewhat more theoretical level .",
    "( 1,0.55 ) ( -0.1,0)=0.4 ( 0.4,0)=0.6     +      as already mentioned above , the undoped lamno@xmath8 with the perovskite structure contains strong jahn - teller ions mn@xmath0 .",
    "they are known to induce a rather strong local distortion in all the insulating compounds that contain them  @xcite .",
    "also in lamno@xmath8 it is well known that there exists an orbital ordering and a concomitant lattice distortion : @xmath10-orbitals of mn@xmath0 ions are ordered in such a way that at the neighbouring mn sites the alternating @xmath11 and @xmath12-orbitals are occupied , i.e. the local o@xmath13-octahedra are alternatingly elongated along @xmath14 and @xmath15-directions , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dlevels ] .",
    "let us mention here the typical energy scales that are involved in the manganites .",
    "the ferromagnetic hunds rule exchange among @xmath16 and @xmath10-electrons is @xmath17 ev per spin pair , the crystal field splitting between these levels ( see fig .  [ fig:3dlevels ] ) is @xmath18 ev , and the jahn teller energy , @xmath19 , which is the splitting of the @xmath10-states by the lattice distortion , is typically an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "orbital ordering is also known to exist in most manganites in another well - defined region of the phase diagram at half - doping @xmath21 .",
    "in this situation with decreasing temperature charge ordering the checkerboard arrangement of mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath22 ions in the basal plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ce_phase ]  @xcite  sets in .",
    "the mn@xmath0-ions with localized electrons again have an orbital degeneracy ( mn@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) ions are nondegenerate , fig .",
    "[ fig:3dlevels ] ) and develop the orbital ordering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ce_phase ] . both the charge ordering ( co ) and the oo occur simultaneously at the same temperature ,",
    "although from some data it follows that probably the co is the driving force , and the oo follows it  @xcite ; this however is still an open question .    according to the well - known goodenough  kanamori  anderson rules ( see e.g.  @xcite ) the magnitude and even the sign of the magnetic exchange depend on the type of orbitals that are occupied .",
    "thus if the orbitals occupied by one electron ( half - filled orbitals ) are directed towards each another , one has a strong antiferromagnetic coupling ; if however these orbitals are directed away from each other ( are mutually orthogonal ) we would have a ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "that is why the undoped lamno@xmath8 ( fig .  [ fig:3dlevels ] ) has the a - type magnetic ordering the spins in the @xmath24-plane order ferromagnetically , the next @xmath25-layer being antiparallel to the first one .",
    "there are two more regions of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] in which orbital effects apparently play an important role , although the detailed picture is less clear .",
    "these are the low - doped region @xmath26 ( depending on the specific system considered ) in which one often observes the ferromagnetic insulating ( fi ) and presumably charge - ordered phase .",
    "this is the case of la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 ( @xmath27 ) , la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 close to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 )  @xcite and pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 ( @xmath30 )  @xcite .",
    "it is rather uncommon to have a fi state : typically insulating materials of this class are antiferromagnetic , and ferromagnetism goes hand in hand with metallicity , which is naturally explained in the model of double exchange  @xcite .",
    "the only possibility to obtain the fi state in perovkites is due to a certain particular orbital ordering favourable for ferromagnetism  @xcite ( the fi state can appear also in systems in which there exists the @xmath31-superexchange : the tm ",
    "o  tm angle is close to @xmath31 ) .",
    "but what is the detailed ordering in this low - doped region , is not completely clear , see section  [ sec : lowdoping ] .",
    "another interesting , and much less explored , region is the overdoped manganites , @xmath32 .",
    "typically in this case we have an insulating state , sometimes with the co and oo state in the form of stripes  @xcite or bistripes  @xcite .",
    "the choice between these two options is still a matter of controversy ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as the detailed type of magnetic ordering in this case .",
    "we will return to this point in section  [ sec : x.gt.half ] . when discussing the properties of overdoped manganites at @xmath32",
    ", one should mention an important fact : the very strong asymmetry of the typical phase diagram of manganites . as seen e.g.  from fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , there usually exists a rather large ferromagnetic metallic region ( fm ) for @xmath33 , but almost never for @xmath32 ( only rarely one observes bad metallic behavior and unsaturated ferromagnetism in a narrow concentration range in some overdoped manganites  @xcite ) .",
    "however from the standard double - exchange model one can expect the appearance of a fm phase not only in hole - doped lamno@xmath8 ( @xmath33 ) but in electron - doped camno@xmath8 ( @xmath32 ) as well .",
    "orbital degeneracy may play some role in explaining this asymmetry  @xcite see section  [ sec : x.ge.half ] .",
    "there exists also a problem as to what are the orbitals doing in the optimally doped ferromagnetic and metallic manganites .",
    "usually one completely ignores orbital degrees of freedom in this regime , at least at low temperatures ; this is supported by the experimental observations that the mno@xmath13-octahedra are completely regular in this case .",
    "but orbital degrees of freedom can not just vanish . in this doping regime",
    "there is a strong competition between the tendency of orbitals to order locally and the kinetic energy of the charge carriers that tends to destroy long range orbital order .",
    "this is comparable to the situation in high t@xmath34 superconductors , where the long - range antiferromagnetic order of , in this case , spins is frustrated by mobile charge carriers .",
    "in an analogous way the mobile holes in optimally doped manganites can melt the orbital order : in the ferromagnetic metallic phase of the manganites the orbital degrees of freedom do not simply disappear , but instead the orbitals are `` rotating '' very fast and may form resonating orbital bonds , see section  [ sec : quantum ] .",
    "another option orbital ordering of a new type with `` complex orbitals '' is discussed in section  [ sec : complexoo ] .      before discussing particular situations in different doping ranges , it is worthwhile to address briefly the general question of possible interactions of degenerate orbitals which can lead to orbital ordering . in transition metal compounds",
    "there are essentially two such mechanisms .",
    "the first one is connected with the jahn - teller interaction of degenerate orbitals with the lattice distortions , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism was proposed in 1972  @xcite , see also  @xcite , and is a direct generalization of the usual superexchange  @xcite to the case of orbital degeneracy .",
    "a convenient mathematical way to describe orbital ordering is to introduce operators @xmath35 of the pseudospin @xmath36 , describing the orbital occupation , so that e.g.  the state @xmath37 corresponds to the occupied orbital @xmath38 , and @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the first one corresponds to a local elongation of the o@xmath13-octahedra ( distortion coordinate @xmath41 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : q2-q3 ] , and the second to local contraction @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the second degenerate @xmath43-phonon which can also lift electronic @xmath10-degeneracy , @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : q2-q3 ] , corresponds to a pseudospin operator @xmath45 .",
    "one can describe an arbitrary distortion and corresponding wave function by linear superpositions of the states @xmath46 and @xmath39 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an angle in @xmath49-plane .     and @xmath50 jahn - teller distortions of a mno@xmath13 octahedron . ]",
    "the jahn - teller mechanism for orbital ordering starts from the electron ",
    "phonon interaction , which in our case can be written in the form @xmath51 + \\sum_{\\alpha q } \\omega_{\\alpha q}b^\\dagger_{\\alpha q}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha q } \\label{hpho_orb}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the phonon operators corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath44 local modes . excluding the phonons by a standard procedure , one obtains the orbital interaction having the form of a pseudospin ",
    "pseudospin interaction @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 . due to different dispersion of the different relevant phonon modes , and due to the anisotropic nature of electron  phonon coupling , the interaction ( [ eq3 ] ) is in general anisotropic .",
    "similarly , the exchange mechanism of orbital ordering may be described by the hamiltonian containing the pseudospins @xmath35 , but it contains also the ordinary spins @xmath58 .",
    "the effective superexchange hamiltonian can be derived starting from the degenerate hubbard model  @xcite , and it has schematically the form @xmath59 here the orbital part @xmath60 , similar to ( [ eq3 ] ) , is in general anisotropic , whereas the spin exchange is heisenberg - like .",
    "in contrast to the jahn - teller induced interaction , the exchange mechanism describes not only the orbital and spin orderings separately , but also the coupling between them ( last term in  ( [ eq5 ] ) ) .",
    "this mechanism is rather successful in explaining the spin and orbital structure in a number of materials  @xcite , including lamno@xmath8 ( for the latter system one has to invoke also the anharmonicity effects  @xcite see also  @xcite ) .    as to the electron - lattice interaction ,",
    "typically one includes mostly the coupling with the local i.e .",
    "optical vibrations  @xcite .",
    "however no less important may be the interaction with the long - wavelength acoustical phonons , or , simply speaking , with the elastic deformations . generally , when one puts an impurity in a crystal , e.g.replacing the small mn@xmath22 ion in camno@xmath8 by the somewhat larger mn@xmath0 ion , which in addition causes a local lattice distortion due to the jahn - teller effect ( i.e.  we replace a `` spherical '' mn@xmath22 ion by an `` ellipsoidal '' mn@xmath0 ) , this creates a strain field which is in general anisotropic and decays rather slowly , as @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "a second `` impurity '' of this kind `` feels '' this strain , which leads to an effective long - range interaction between them .",
    "this can naturally lead to the spontaneous formation of different superstructures in doped materials  @xcite .",
    "thus , there may appear vertical or diagonal stripes , even for non - jahn - teller systems . in case of manganites",
    "one can show that there appears e.g. an effective attraction between @xmath11 and @xmath12-orbitals in @xmath14 and @xmath15-direction ; this immediately gives the orbital ordering of lamno@xmath8-type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dlevels ] . for @xmath21 , assuming the checkerboard charge ordering , one gets from this mechanism the correct orbital ordering shown in fig .  [ fig : ce_phase ]  @xcite . and for overdoped manganites one can get either single or paired stripes , depending on the ratio of corresponding constants : one can show  @xcite that for a diagonal pair like the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] , one gets an attraction of the same orbitals @xmath11 and @xmath11 or @xmath12 and @xmath12 , but repulsion of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus , if one takes into account only these nearest neighbour diagonal interactions , the single stripe phase of fig .  [ fig : stripes ] would be more favourable than the paired stripes of the fig .  [",
    "fig : stripes ] .",
    "however the latter may in principle be stabilizes by more distant interactions like those for a pair of mn@xmath0 ions along @xmath14 and @xmath15-directions in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] . which state is finally more favourable , is still not clear , see ref .",
    "in the previous section we have given some examples that show that the interaction of orbital degrees of freedom among themselves and the interaction with electron spins or with the lattice , can give rise to long - range orbital ordered states .",
    "experimentally the manganites seem to be especially susceptible to an orbital order instability at commensurate doping concentrations : the undoped system is a canonical example of an orbitally - ordered mott insulator and for @xmath63 orbitals are ordered in most manganites .",
    "below we discuss the situation for @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the possibility of orbital order in the metallic phase .",
    "every ordered state has one or more elementary excitations related to the actual symmetry that is broken by the long - range order . in spin systems this symmetry is often continuous , which leads to the occurence of a goldstone mode , in this case a spin - wave magnon that has a vanishing excitation energy when its wavelength is very long .",
    "related to the ordering of orbitals there should therefore be an elementary excitation with orbital character : the orbiton .",
    "recently this orbital wave was actually observed experimentally  @xcite . in this and the next section",
    "we discuss some of its properties , emphasizing that the orbital mode is gapped and that it strongly interacts with lattice and spin degrees of freedom  @xcite .      as already mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , typically there exist a ferromagnetic insulating region at low doping ( @xmath66 for the lasr system , @xmath67 for laca , @xmath68 for prca ) .",
    "the problem is to explain the origin of the fi state in this case .",
    "apparently it should be connected with an orbital ordering of some kind ; but what is the specific type of this ordering , is largely unknown .",
    "the most complete , but still controversial , data exist on the lasr - system close to @xmath64 .",
    "there exists a superstructure in this system  @xcite , and an orbital ordering was detected in the fi phase in  @xcite .",
    "certain orbital superstructures were also seen by the resonant x - ray scattering in pr@xmath69ca@xmath70mno@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "both these systems , however , were looked at by this method only at one @xmath71-point [ 300 ] , which is not sufficient to uniquely determine the type of orbital ordering .",
    "the existing structural data , or rather the interpretation of this data , is still controversial  @xcite .",
    "theoretically two possibilities were discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "first of all one can argue that when one puts a mn@xmath22 ion into mn@xmath0 matrix , the orbitals of all the ions surrounding the localized hole ( mn@xmath22 ) would be directed towards it , see fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron]@xmath72  @xcite . one can call such state an orbital polaron .",
    "we use the concept of orbital polaron in a rather loose sense here and for a somewhat more formal discussion we refer to section  [ sec : polarons ]",
    ". these polarons , which according to goodenough  kanamori  anderson rules would be ferromagnetic , can then order e.g.  as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron]@xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "the calculations carried out in @xcite show that this state is indeed stable , and it corresponds to a ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "thus it is a possible candidate for a fi state at @xmath75 e.g.  in pr ",
    "ca system .",
    "however there exist an alternative possibility .",
    "calculations show  @xcite that a similar state with ordered polarons is also locally stable for @xmath76 .",
    "but it turned out that the lower energy is reached in this case by different type of charge and orbital ordering , fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron]@xmath77  @xcite : the holes are localized only in every second @xmath25-plane , so that one such plane containing only mn@xmath0 ions develops the orbital ordering of the type of lamno@xmath8 , fig .",
    "[ fig:3dlevels ] , and the holes in the next plane concentrate in `` stripes '' , e.g.  along @xmath14-direction .",
    "this state also turns out to be ferromagnetic , and the superstructure obtained agrees with the experimental results of @xcite and @xcite for la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 , @xmath76 .",
    "one can think that the situation can be also similar for @xmath75 which would agree with the data of  @xcite .",
    "this type of the charge ordering ( segregation of holes in every second plane ) may be favourable due to an extra stability of the lamno@xmath8-type orbital ordering , strongly favoured by the elastic interactions  @xcite , as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "a `` mixed '' possibility is in principle also possible : there may exist for example a similar charge segregation into a hole - rich and hole - poor plane , but the orbitals may rather behave as is shown in fig .",
    "1.5@xmath72 , i.e. contrary to fig 1.5@xmath77 , there may be partial occupation of @xmath78-orbitals at certain sites .",
    "let us discuss the most important phase that of optimal doping , @xmath79 - @xmath80 . in most cases the systems in this doping range",
    "are ferromagnetic and metallic at low temperatures , although the residual resistivity is usually relatively large .",
    "now , the question is : what are the orbitals doing in this phase ?",
    "experimentally one observes that the macroscopic jahn - teller ordering and corresponding lattice distortion is gone in this regime .",
    "ca system remains orthorhombic in this concentration range , but that is due to the tilting of the o@xmath13 octahedra , the octahedra themselves being regular ( all the mn  o",
    "distances are the same ) .",
    "the structure of the la  sr manganites in this regime is rhombohedral , but again all the mn  o distances are equal .",
    "moreover even the local probes such as exafs or pdf ( pair distribution function analysis of neutron scattering )  @xcite , which detect local distortions above and close to @xmath81 , show that for @xmath82 they completely disappear , and mno@xmath13-octahedra are regular even locally .    what happens then with the orbital degrees of freedom ?",
    "there are several possibilities .",
    "one is that in this phase the system may already be an ordinary metal , the electronic structure of which is reasonably well described by the conventional band theory . in this case",
    "we should not worry about orbitals at all : we may have a band structure consisting of several bands , some of which , not necessarily one , may cross fermi - level , and we should not speak of orbital ordering in this case , just as we do not use this terminology and do not worry about orbital ordering in metals like al or nb which often have several bands at the fermi - level .",
    "if however there exist strong electron correlations in our system ( i.e. the hubbard s on - site repulsion @xmath83 is bigger that the corresponding bandwidth ) one should worry about it .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom should then do something . in principle",
    "there exists two options .",
    "one is that the ground state would still be disordered due to quantum fluctuations , forming an orbital liquid  @xcite , similar in spirit to the rvb state of the spin system ( we can speak of the pseudospin rvb state ) .",
    "we discuss this physics in the next section .",
    "there is also an alternative possibility : there may in principle occur an orbital ordering of a novel type , without any lattice distortion , involving not the orbitals of the type  ( [ eq1 ] ) , but the _ complex _ orbitals linear superpositions of the basic orbitals @xmath78 and @xmath84 with the complex coefficients , e.g. @xmath85 this possibility was first suggested in  @xcite and then explored in  @xcite ; independently a similar conclusion was reached a bit later in  @xcite .",
    "one may easily see that the distribution of the electron density in this state is the same in all three directions , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and  @xmath86 .",
    "thus this ordering does not induce any lattice distortion the mno@xmath13 octahedra remain regular , and the system is cubic ( if we ignore tilting of the octahedra ) .",
    "on the other hand , the state with complex coefficients , as always is the case with complex wave functions , breaks time - reversal invariance , i.e. this state is in some sense magnetic .",
    "one can show however that the magnetic dipole moment in this case is zero it is well known that the orbital moment is quenched in @xmath10-states ( these states are actually @xmath87 and @xmath88 states of the @xmath89 @xmath90-orbitals ) .",
    "similarly , the magnetic quadrupole moment is also zero , by parity arguments .",
    "the first nonzero moment in this state is a magnetic octupole .",
    "indeed , the actual order parameter in this case is the average @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the components of the orbital moment @xmath89 of @xmath90-electrons , and s means the symmetrization .",
    "this operator is actually proportional to the @xmath93-operator of pseudospin , i.e. the order parameter of this type of orbital ordering is @xmath94 .",
    "one can visualize this state as the one in which there exist orbital currents at each unit cell .",
    "each time we have certain ordering in solids , corresponding excitations should appear .",
    "the quadrupolar charge ordering orbital ordering should give rise to elementary excitations with orbital signature , as this order causes a breaking of symmetry in the orbital sector .",
    "these excitations we may call them orbitons were first discussed shortly in  @xcite and recently were studied theoretically in several papers , e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "one of the problems that could complicate an experimental observation of these excitations , is the usually rather strong jahn - teller coupling of orbital degrees of freedom with the lattice distortions .",
    "this could make it very difficult , if not impossible , to `` decouple '' orbitons from phonons . and",
    "indeed the experimental efforts to observe orbitons were unsuccessful for many years .",
    "a breakthrough came only recently when the group of y.  tokura managed to observe the manifestations of orbital excitations in raman scattering on untwinned single crystals of lamno@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the observed orbitons were interpreted by the authors as being due to electron correlations  @xcite , but in the comment that accompagnied this publication it was immediately mentioned that here the coupling to phonons can also be very important  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly discuss the question of the origin of orbitons ; this is also important as they , in turn , have a large effect on spin  @xcite and charge excitations  @xcite , as we discussed in the previous section .",
    "the physical aspects of the coupling between the orbital excitation and jahn - teller phonons can be illustrated by considering the orbital and phonon excitations as dispersionless .",
    "we can view this as a reasonable first approximation because orbital excitations are always gapped ( see next section ) and jahn - teller lattice excitations are optical phonons . applying this simplification to eqs.([hpho_orb ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) leads to the single - site hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath95 q^{\\dagger } q +   \\omega_0 ( b_{3}^{\\dagger}b_{3}+b_{2}^{\\dagger}b_{2 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g ( q^{\\dagger}+q )   ( b_{2}^{\\dagger}+b_{2 } ) ,   \\label{h_loc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath96 operator describes an orbiton excitation , @xmath97 are the @xmath98 phonon modes and @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath101 the jt phonon frequency and @xmath102 the superexchange energy .",
    "let us discuss three important consequences of the orbiton - phonon coupling in eq .",
    "( [ h_loc ] ) .",
    "first , the coupling to the lattice moves the orbiton to higher energy an amount @xmath103 .",
    "this shift has a straightforward physical meaning : it is the phonon contribution to the crystal - field splitting of the @xmath10-states caused by the static jahn - teller lattice deformation .",
    "the effective orbital excitation energy is the sum of the local orbital exchange energy and static phonon contribution to the crystal - field splitting .",
    "if , however , an orbital excitation is made , it strongly interacts with the @xmath50 phonon , so that the orbital excitation can be dynamically screened by the jahn - teller phonons and lowered in energy .",
    "the crystal - field splitting and screening are strongly competing as both are governed by the energy scale set by the electron - phonon coupling . finally , the orbital and @xmath44 phonon modes mix , as is clear from the last term of @xmath104 .",
    "this implies that the true eigenmodes of the coupled orbital - phonon system have both orbital and phonon character .",
    "in general , the mixing of orbital and phonon mode gives rise to extra phonon satellites in the orbiton spectral function at energy intervals of @xmath101 .",
    "vice versa , due to this mixing , a low intensity orbital satellites at @xmath105 will be present in the @xmath44 phonon spectral function . as discussed above , the most plausible estimates of the jahn - teller energy ( @xmath106 )",
    "are @xmath107 mev , and the superexchange @xmath108 mev . with these estimates , keeping in mind the results described above the strong mixing of the orbital excitation and the phonons one comes to the conclusion that the features at 150 mev observed in the raman experiment  @xcite , interpreted there as pure orbital excitations , are rather the orbiton - derived satellites in the phonon spectral function , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ]  @xcite . a framework beyond the toy model described above",
    "is needed to establish the relevance of such an interpretation , and to establish the exact nature of the satellites in the raman spectra : this is still an open issue , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "but it is clear that the elementary excitations of an orbital ordered system are mixed modes with both orbital and phonon character , or , in other words , are determined by both electron correlation effects and the electron - lattice interaction .",
    "below the cooperative orbital / jahn - teller transition temperature , a long - range coherence of orbital polarization sets in , and spin - exchange interactions on every bond are fixed by the goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite .",
    "implicit in this picture is that the orbital splittings are large enough so that we can consider orbital populations as classical numbers .",
    "such a classical treatment of orbitals is certainly justified when orbital order is driven by strong cooperative lattice distortions that lead to a large splitting of the initially degenerate orbital levels . in this limit",
    "the orbital excitations are more or less localized high - energy quadrupole moment ( or crystal - field ) transitions , and therefore they effectively just renormalize spin degrees of freedom but otherwise do not effect much the physical properties of the system at low energy scales .",
    "quantum effects , however , can start to dominate the ground state properties and elementary excitations when classical order is frustrated by some interaction that opposes the tendency of the orbitals to order .",
    "the reason that this might very well be the case in some regions of the phase diagram of the manganites is that orbitals strongly interact with spins via the superexchange and that orbital order is frustrated by the kinetic energy of carriers in a metallic system .",
    "but the actual situation in manganites is still under debate ; while in the undoped case the orbital excitations are rather high in energy and therefore quite decoupled from the spins , there are many indications that orbital dynamics play an essential role in the physics of doped manganites .    in this section",
    "we discuss several physical examples and some theoretical models that show that there is a strong dynamical interplay between orbital fluctuations and spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "both spin exchange and charge motion are highly sensitive to the orbital bonds , and the basic idea is that the interaction energy can not be optimized simultaneously in all the bonds : this leads to the peculiar frustrations and quantum resonances among orbital bonds .",
    "of course a classical treatment in such cases gives very poor estimates of energies , and the quantum dynamics of the coupled orbital - spin - charge system becomes of crucial importance , as we illustrate below in the context of several theoretical models with coupled orbital , spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the important physics , quantum effects , largely depend on some particular properties of orbital systems , notably the frustration in the orbital sector , which are absent in canonical spin and spin - charge models , e.g. the t - j model . to explain this",
    ", we devote some time to a more theoretical discussion , treating some orbital and spin - orbital models ( section  [ sec : models ] and  [ sec : orbitalmodels ] ) ; later on in this chapter we will apply these concepts to the discussion of properties of manganites in the cubic metallic phase ( sections  [ sec : liquid ] and  [ sec : magnon ] )      quantum fluctuations of the orbitals originate mainly from two kind of interactions . first we discuss the superexchange interaction , and the second mechanism the very effective frustration of orbitals by doped holes we describe later on .",
    "let us take as an example a toy version of the full superexchange model ( proposed by kugel and khomskii  @xcite ) .",
    "on a three - dimensional cubic lattice it takes the form : @xmath109 with @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath83 are , respectively , the hopping integral and on - site coulomb repulsion in the hubbard model for two - fold degenerate @xmath10-electrons at half filling .",
    "the structure of @xmath112 depends on the index @xmath113 which specifies the orientation of the bond @xmath114 relative to the cubic axes @xmath115 and",
    "@xmath77 : @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the pauli matrices .",
    "physically the @xmath119 operators describe the dependence of the spin - exchange interaction on the orbitals that are occupied , and the main feature of this model as is suggested by the very form of hamiltonian ( [ ham2]) is the strong interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "it was recognized first in ref .",
    "@xcite that this simple model contains rather nontrivial physics : the classical nel state in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) ( where @xmath120 ) is infinitely degenerate in the orbital sector ; this extra degeneracy must be lifted by some mechanism .",
    "( 1,1 ) ( 0,0 ) = ( 0.1,0.53 ) = 0.11    before discussing this mechanism , let us first elaborate on this degeneracy and the importance of quantum effects in this case .",
    "we first notice that the effective spin exchange constant in this model is definite positive ( @xmath121 ) for any configuration of orbitals , where its value can vary from zero to @xmath102 , depending on the orientation of orbital pseudospins .",
    "we therefore expect a simple two - sublattice antiferromagnetic , g - type , spin order .",
    "there is however a problem : a classical g - type ordering has cubic symmetry and can therefore not lift the orbital degeneracy , not even locally . in more formal terms , the spin part @xmath122 of the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , in mean field approximation , simply becomes zero in this state for all bonds , so that these orbitals effectively do not interact they are completely uncorrelated and hence retain full rotational freedom on every lattice site .",
    "in other words , we gain no energy from the orbital interactions that are present in the model .",
    "this shows that from the point of view of the orbitals the classical nel state is energetically a very poor state of the system .",
    "the mechanism for developing intersite orbital correlations ( and hence to gain energy from orbital ordering ) must involve a strong deviation in the spin configuration from the nel state a deviation from @xmath123 .",
    "this implies an intrinsic tendency of the system to develop low - dimensional spin fluctuations which can most effectively be realized by an ordering of orbitals as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] .",
    "in this situation the effective spin interaction is quasi - one - dimensional along the chains in the c - direction so that quantum spin fluctuations are enhanced as much as possible and quantum energy is gained from the bonds along the chain . here @xmath124 , so that the effective orbital ( pseudospin ) exchange is indeed ferromagnetic , which leads to the orbital structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] . at the same time the cubic symmetry",
    "is explicitely broken , as fluctuations of spin bonds are different in different directions .",
    "this leads to a finite splitting of @xmath10-levels , and therefore an orbital gap is generated .",
    "one can say that in order to stabilize the ground state , orbital order and spin fluctuations support and enhance each other a situation that is very similar to villain s order from disorder phenomena known previously from frustrated spin systems  @xcite .    from the technical point of view , it is obvious that a conventional expansion about the classical nel state would fail to remove the orbital degeneracy : only quantum fluctuations can lead to orbital correlations .",
    "this is precisely the reason why in a linear spin - wave approximation one does not obtain an orbital gap , and low - energy singularities appear  @xcite .",
    "the problem was resolved in refs.@xcite : the singularities vanish once quantum spin fluctuations are explicitely taken into account in the calculations of the orbiton spectrum .",
    "these fluctuations generate a finite gap for single orbital as well as for any composite spin - orbital excitation , and in this way the spin fluctuations remove the orbital frustration problem .",
    "the long - range spin - orbital order indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] is stable against residual interactions because of the orbital gap ( of the order of @xmath125 ) , and because of the small , but finite , coupling between spin chains .",
    "in general the kugel - khomskii model is a very nice example of how an apparently three - dimensional system may by itself develop low - dimensio - nal quantum fluctuations .",
    "we find it quite interesting and amusing that these quantum fluctuations do not only coexist with a weak three - dimensional staggered spin moment , but that they are actually of vital importance to stabilize this long - range order by generating an orbital gap and intersite orbital correlations .",
    "the physical origin of this peculiar situation is , of course , the strong spatial anisotropy of the @xmath10-orbital wave functions . because of this anisotropy it is impossible to optimize all the bonds between mn@xmath0 ions simultaneously ; this results in orbital frustration .",
    "the best the system can finally do , is to make specific strong and weak bonds in the lattice , whereby it reduces the effective dimensionality of the spin system in order to gain quantum energy . at the same time tunneling between different orbital configurations",
    "is suppressed : the spin fluctuations produce an energy gap for the rotation of orbitals .",
    "let us consider for the moment the spins to be frozen in a ferromagnetic configuration , and ask how the orbitals would behave in this case .",
    "the model ( [ ham2 ] ) then reads @xmath126 where @xmath127 is given by eq .",
    "( [ pse ] ) and @xmath128 .",
    "this limit has actually been considered in ref.@xcite as a model system to describe orbital dynamics in an undoped orbitally degenerate ferromagnet and for the ferromagnetic insulating phase of underdoped manganites . in the latter case",
    "this mapping is not quite satisfying because the ferromagnetic insulator is in fact stabilized by frozen - in doped holes that strongly affect the orbitals in their neighborhood , as was discussed in section  [ sec : lowdoping ] .",
    "the model ( [ orb ] ) is clearly anisotropic and in that respect underlines the important difference between orbital excitations and conventional spin dynamics .",
    "another very closely related model is a so - called `` cubic '' model defined as follows : @xmath129 where along each a , b and c crystallographic axis only one of the respective orbital operators @xmath45 , @xmath93 and @xmath130 is active . in this",
    " cubic  model the bond anisotropy in hamiltonian  [ orb ] is taken to the extreme . although the model is not directly applicable to the manganites , it is simpler than the model in eq .",
    "( [ orb ] ) , but it still contains the essential bond anisotropy and degeneracy that makes orbital models so different from spin hamiltonians . this model has been proposed and discussed in the context of orbital frustrations already in the 1970 s  @xcite . it is interesting to notice that precisely this `` cubic '' model appears in cubic titanates as a magnetic anisotropy hamiltonian  @xcite .    we discuss the two models in eq  ( [ orb]),([cub ] ) in parallel as they display very similar peculiarities in the low - energy limit . as pseudospins in both models interact antiferromagnetically along all bonds , a staggered orbital ordered state is expected to be the ground state of the system .",
    "in the three - dimensional system at the orbital degeneracy point , however , linear spin - wave theory leads to a gapless two - dimensional excitation spectrum .",
    "this results in an apparent instability of the ordered state at any finite temperature @xcite , an outcome that sounds at least counterintuitive .",
    "actually , the problem is even more severe : a close inspection shows that the interaction corrections to the orbiton excitations diverge even at zero temperature , manifesting that the linear spin - wave expansion about a classical staggered orbital , nel - like , state is not adequate in this case .",
    "the origin of these problems was recently clarified in refs.@xcite . by symmetry , there are only a finite number of directions ( three equivalent cubic axes ) , one of which will be selected by a staggered pseudospin order parameter .",
    "since this breaks only discrete symmetry , the excitations about the ordered state must have a gap .",
    "a linear spin wave theory fails however to give the gap , because eqs.([orb]),([cub ] ) acquire a rotational symmetry in the limit of classical spins .",
    "this results in an infinite degeneracy of classical states , and an accidental pseudo goldstone mode appears , which is however not a symmetry property of the original quantum models ( [ orb]),([cub ] ) .",
    "this artificial gapless mode leads to low - energy divergencies that arise because the coupling constant for the interaction between orbitons does not vanish at zero momentum limit , as it would happen for a true goldstone mode .",
    "hence the interaction effects are non - perturbative .    at this point",
    "the order from disorder mechanism comes again into play : a particular classical state is selected so that the fluctuations about this state maximize the quantum energy gain , and a finite gap in the excitation spectra opens , because in the ground state of the system the rotational invariance is broken .",
    "an orbital gap @xmath131 in the model ( [ orb ] ) has been estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has to be compared with the full orbiton dispersion of @xmath132 .",
    "similarly , the `` cubic '' model with nearest - neighbor interactions shows long - range orbital order and has an excitation gap @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed however , that while ground state and gap issue in models ( [ orb]),([cub ] ) are more or less settled , further studies are required to fully characterize the excitation spectra .",
    "of particular interest are damping effects , as we expect substantial incoherent features in the orbiton modes because of the strong interaction between low - energy ( @xmath134 ) orbitons .    what can we learn from the examples above ?",
    "the calculation of the excitation spectrum in systems with orbital degeneracy is somewhat involved even in the half filled , insulating limit .",
    "this is due to the peculiar frustration of superexchange interactions , which leads to infrared divergencies when linear spin wave theory is applied  @xcite . that such divergencies occur in lowest order approximations is a universal feature of @xmath10-orbital models on cubic lattice it reflects the special symmetry properties of @xmath10-orbital pseudospins . to calculate the excitation spectrum a more careful treatment of quantum effects",
    "is then required .",
    "the main message is that orbital ordering , unlike spin ordering , is not accompanied by a simple goldstone mode .",
    "rather , collective orbiton excitations always have a finite gap and we also expect a substantial incoherent damping over all momentum space .",
    "this distinct feature of the orbitons has to be kept in mind for the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "of course the precise way of how an orbiton gap is generated , depends on the model , but an order from disorder scenario seems to be a rather common mechanism to resolve the frustration of classically degenerate orbital configurations .",
    "it is interesting to note that if one takes instead a similar model but with long - range interaction , e.g. the classical model with dipole - dipole interaction , the conclusion about the long - range order might be modified ; it was shown in  @xcite that there is no long - range order of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dlevels ] in the dipole model in two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "although this review focuses on @xmath10-orbital dynamics , it is worthwhile to mention at this point that orbital frustration is in fact a very general property of all orbital degenerate cubic perovskite compounds , including those with three - fold @xmath16 orbital degeneracy . in this case",
    "the situation is actually even more dramatic because the degeneracy of @xmath16 level is larger  @xcite , which enhances quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the frustration that is present in the @xmath10-system , there also exists the possibility to form quantum singlets and resonating valence bonds among @xmath16 orbitals ( see for the details refs .",
    "therefore quantum tunneling between different local orbital configurations may occur .",

    "the cubic vanadates are also interesting in this respect , although they are different because of the larger spin value . in this case",
    "the spin - orbital frustration is again resolved by the order from disorder mechanism with the help of low - dimensional orbital fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we turn now to doping effects in manganites and first discuss the low doping regime .",
    "a doped hole in the mott insulator strongly interacts with a variety of low - energy degrees of freedom , which leads to polaronic effects . in a pure spin - charge @xmath135 model , as are used for the cuprates , a hole breaks the spin bonds , and more importantly , frustrates spin order when it hops around . in manganites , the presence of orbital degeneracy brings about new degrees of freedom that control the dynamics of holes .",
    "as is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , there are in general two channels of orbital - charge coupling .",
    "the first one , that acts via the electron - transfer term of the orbital @xmath135 hamiltonian  @xcite , is very similar to the spin - charge coupling mentioned above .",
    "this interaction of holes with orbital degrees of freedom changes the character of the hole motion : the scattering on orbital excitations leads to a suppression of the coherent quasiparticle weight @xmath136 :  @xcite @xmath137 \\quad for j\\gg t,\\\\ \\displaystyle \\sqrt[4]{2\\pi^2}\\;\\left(\\frac{j}{t}\\right)^{1/4 } \\quad for j\\ll t. \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath138 a coherent hole motion with @xmath139 is recovered .",

    "when this orbital polaron picture is combined with that of conventional lattice polarons  @xcite , the transition from ferromagnetic metal to ferromagnetic insulator can be well explained  @xcite .",

    "the appearance of a ferromagnetic metallic state is explained in a framework of double exchange physics  @xcite .",

    "the notion of an orbital liquid , which describes a quantum disordered state of @xmath10-quadrupole moments in metallic manganites , was introduced .",

    "the first one is that in a ferromagnetic system the orbital superexchange interactions are rather frustrated from the very beginning and this actually favors the orbital liquid , as we discussed previously .",
    "the effective two - dimensionality of the pseudospin fluctuations is , in fact , emphasized in  @xcite as an important disorder mechanism .",
    "while indeed enhancing quantum effects , this effect alone would still not be sufficient to destroy the pseudospin order , as one can see from the behavior of orbital models discussed above .",
    "rather , it acts cooperatively with the frustrations induced by charge motion .",
    "the second , and most important , difference from cuprates is the strong tendency for holes in manganites to localize and form orbital / lattice polarons .",
    "it is the restricted charge mobility that confines the orbital liquid metallic state of manganites to a rather small region of the phase diagram .",

    "the small drude peak as well as a broad optical absorption spectrum , that extends up to the bare bandwidth , are well reproduced by these calculations .",
    "the physical picture is that the charge carriers scatter strongly on the dynamical disorder caused by the fluctuations of orbital bonds that are due to the correlated rotation of orbitals .",
    "the fact that the anomalous transport properties in the ferromagnetic metallic phase can be described consistently , supports the validity of the orbital - liquid framework .",
    "finally , we discuss one more interesting manifestation of the orbital fluctuations in ferromagnetic metallic manganites . according to the conventional theory of double exchange , the spin dynamics of the ferromagnetic state",
    "is expected to be of nearest - neighbor heisenberg type with a simple cosine - like magnon dispersion  @xcite .",
    "this picture seems indeed to be reasonably accurate for manganese oxides with high curie temperature @xmath146 , i.e. , for compounds with a ferromagnetic metallic phase that is sustained up to rather high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies on compounds with low values of @xmath146 indicate , however , marked deviations from this canonical behavior .",
    "quite prominent in this respect are measurements of the spin dynamics of the ferromagnetic manganese oxide pr@xmath153sr@xmath154mno@xmath8  @xcite . while the spin excitation spectra exhibit conventional heisenberg behavior at small momenta , the dispersion of magnetic excitations ( magnons ) shows a curious softening at the boundary of the brillouin zone in the [ 1,0,0 ] and [ 1,1,0 ] direction but _ not _ in the [ 1,1,1 ] direction .",
    "the origin of this unusual softening has been attributed in ref.@xcite to the low - energy orbital fluctuations present in a `` narrow - band '' manganites .",
    "let us briefly explain the basic idea .",
    "the strength of the ferromagnetic interaction at a given bond strongly depends on the orbital state of @xmath10-electrons ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mbd ] ) . along the @xmath86 direction , for instance , only electrons in @xmath155 orbitals can hop between sites and hence can participate in the double - exchange processes , but the transfer of @xmath156 electrons is blocked due to the vanishing overlap with o-@xmath157 orbitals located in - between two neighboring mn sites .",
    "temporal fluctuations of @xmath10-orbitals may thus modulate the magnetic exchange bonds , thereby renormalizing the magnon dispersion .",
    "actually , such an effect is a quite general property of orbitally degenerate systems ; the same kind of zone - boundary softening has been predicted in the insulating kugel - khomskii model as well  @xcite .

    "the orbital state effectively enters the spin dynamics only as a time average , which restores the cubic symmetry of exchange bonds . on the other hand ,",
    "if orbitals fluctuate slower than spins , then the renormalization of the magnon spectrum is most pronounced and the anisotropy imposed upon the magnetic exchange bonds by the orbital degree of freedom comes into play .",
    "also a damping of magnons is then expected to occur , which may explain the large broadening of magnons at the zone boundary .",
    "we note that the magnons in @xmath160 $ ] direction are sensitive to all three spatial directions of the exchange bonds ; their dispersion therefore remains unaffected by the local dynamical symmetry breaking induced by low - dimensional orbital correlations .",
    "this leads to a strong anisotropy of magnon renormalization effects in a momentum space : the @xmath161 $ ] , @xmath162 $ ] directions are mostly affected , which is actually in agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the momentum and energy dependence of magnon anomalies are in general very sensitive to the character of local orbital correlations , and may therefore change with the evolution of underlying orbital states . in other words , if the [ 0,0,1 ] magnon mode softens to zero at the zone boundary , than this would signal the transition from ferromagnetic to the a - type antiferromagnetic spin ordering .",
    "the unusual magnon dispersion experimentally observed in low-@xmath146 manganites can hence be understood as a precursor effect of orbital / lattice ordering .",
    "while the softening of magnons at the zone boundary is responsible for reducing the value of @xmath146 , the small - momentum spin dynamics that enters the spin - wave stiffness @xmath163 remains essentially unaffected .",
    "this explains the enhancement of the ratio @xmath164 observed in low-@xmath146 compounds  @xcite .",
    "we can state in general that quantum fluctuations of orbital degrees of freedom in manganites are important and have to be taken into account in the explanation of various properties of these systems . despite ( or",
    "even due to ) the absence of the rotational symmetry in the orbital sector , profound non - classical behavior of orbitals can be caused by the frustrating nature of interactions in the orbital sector and by the strong coupling of orbitals to doped holes .",
    "we did not discuss the consequences of electron - phonon coupling on the orbital liquid state , so the question arises how phonons would change the physics we discussed in this section .",
    "breathing phonons , which are certainly important for a charge localization , are actually implemented in the above picture through the interaction in eq .",

    "however , the fact that jahn - teller phonon frequencies may fall into the region of electronic orbiton energies makes the problem very difficult to analyze , particularly at the proximity to the insulator - metal transition ( which is , simultaneously , an orbital solid - liquid transitions ) in the phase diagram of manganites .",
    "in the phase diagram of the manganites ( fig .  [ fig : phase ] ) there is an apparent asymmetry between the case @xmath166 and the case @xmath167 . at lower doping levels",
    "ferromagnetic states dominate , one of which is metallic , and for high doping concentrations antiferromagnetic insulating phases dominate . exactly at @xmath63 for most manganites a rather remarkable antiferromagnetic ( ce - type ) charge - ordered insulating state is usually realized . in section  [ sec : x.gt.half ] we discuss the properties of manganites at high doping levels and why they are so different from the systems with less doped carriers . in the next section",
    "we describe the situation at half filling and discuss the actual mechanism that leads to the ce - type ( charge , orbital and magnetic ) ordering in half - doped manganites .",
    "the half - doped manganites with @xmath63 are very particular . magnetically these systems form ferromagnetic zig - zag chains that are coupled antiferromagnetically ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ce_phase ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ce_phase2 ] ) at low temperatures , the so - called magnetic ce - phase  @xcite .",
    "the ground state is , moreover , an orbitally ordered and charge - ordered insulator .",
    "this behavior is generic and is experimentally observed in nd@xmath168sr@xmath168mno@xmath8  @xcite , pr@xmath168ca@xmath168mno@xmath8  @xcite , la@xmath168ca@xmath168mno@xmath8  @xcite , nd@xmath168ca@xmath168mno@xmath8  @xcite and in the half - doped layered manganite la@xmath168sr@xmath169mno@xmath170  @xcite .",
    "the insulating charge - ordered state can be transformed into a metallic fm state by application of an external magnetic field , a transition that is accompanied by a change in resistivity of several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the extraordinary properties of the half - doped manganites are due to the commensurability of the doping level .",
    "the disorder caused by orbital fluctuations can be quenched by magnetic , lattice and charge instabilities that are most pronounced at this commensurate filling .",
    "the combining effect of these three instabilities leads to an effectively one - dimensional insulating state , to the charge ordering and to the unusual magnetic ordering in these systems .    in the double - exchange framework electrons",
    "can only hop between sites with fm aligned core - spins so that in the ce - phase only hopping processes within the zig - zag chains are possible , rendering the system effectively one - dimensional for low - energy charge fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the unit cell of the quasi-1d system contains two mn atoms , one situated at a corner site and one situated at a bridge - site , between two corners .",
    "as there are two orbitals per site , the cell has in total four different orbitals , and at half doping we have on average one electron per unit cell .",
    "the topology of the electron hopping integrals between orbitals is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hopce ] .",
    "the important observation is that an electron that hops from one bridge - site to another bridge - site via a @xmath171 corner - orbital obtains a phase - factor @xmath172 , while if the hopping takes place via a @xmath173 corner - orbital , the phase - factor is @xmath174 .",
    "this phase factor can be viewed as an effective dimerization that splits the four bands .",
    "these bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hopce ] , where there are two bands with energy @xmath175 , where @xmath71 is the wave vector , and degenerate two dispersionless bands at zero energy . at @xmath176",
    "the @xmath177 band is fully occupied , and all other bands are empty .",
    "the system is insulating as the occupied and empty bands are split by a gap @xmath178 and the minority bands with spin opposite to the ferromagnetic orientation of the chain ( not shown ) are about @xmath179 higher in energy ( @xmath179 is the hund s rule exchange energy ) .",
    "( 1,0.5 ) ( -0.2,0.2)=0.6 ( 0.5,0)=0.6     +    the gap is very robust as it is a consequence of the staggered phase - factor that itself is fully determined by the topology of the system . in principle",
    "other quasi 1d magnetic states , e.g. antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic straight chains , are also possible ; they would correspond to a state with all orbitals of the mn - sites e.g. of the @xmath11 type , instead of alternating @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "but the presence of a gap stabilizes the ce - phase .",
    "this mechanism is equivalent to the situation in the lattice - peierls problem , where the opening of a gap stabilizes a ground state with a lattice deformation .",
    "an extra reason for the stability of this phase maybe be the elastic interactions  @xcite .",
    "we see the importance of the commensurability : for @xmath167 the excess holes deplete the valence band , reducing the effect of the energy gain due to the gap .",
    "one expects that in this case other magnetic phases , that do not support such a gap , compete strongly with the ce - phase .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath166 , the excess electrons will enter in non - dispersive bands and would not contribute to the kinetic energy of the system and would thereby effectively destabilize the ce - phase .",
    "in fact it was argued that in this case the system is phase separated  @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the ce - phase survives in pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 to @xmath180 .    but why should the system organize itself into a quasi one - dimensional state in the first place ?",
    "it is rather obvious that in a three - dimensional state , where there is much more freedom for an electron to move around , the kinetic energy would be lower .",
    "the answer is that in the manganites there are two competing magnetic interactions : the double exchange , favoring ferromagnetism , and the superexchange , that is a driving force for antiferromagnetism .",
    "the system can gain energy from both interactions simultaneously when in some direction antiferro .",
    "bonds are formed , and in other directions ferro .",
    "electrons can then only propagate along ferromagnetic bonds because of the double exchange .",
    "this mechanism is especially effective for systems with @xmath10-orbitals and is in fact quite common in the highly doped manganites we will discuss this in the next section .",
    "the situation reminds us of the order from disorder scenario in spin - orbital models discussed in section  [ sec : models ] : by forming different kinds of bonds which is quite natural for spatially strongly anisotropic",
    "@xmath10-orbitals the system gains energy .    in the ce - phase",
    "only the elongated orbitals at the bridge site ( the @xmath11 and @xmath12 ones ) are occupied ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ce_phase2 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that because of the symmetry the orthogonal , planar orbitals on the bridge sites do not have any overlap with orbitals at the corner sites and in first approximation do not interact with the rest of the system . on the corner sites both orbitals",
    "are in principle partially occupied .",
    "the different orbital occupation on bridge and corner site the orbital order causes a lattice deformation via the jahn - teller coupling , thereby lowering the energy of the system still further .",
    "let us now discuss the consequences of electron - electron interactions at half filling . in principle one",
    "expect that short range electronic density - density interactions , that lead to the mott insulator at zero doping , have less impact on physical properties when doping is increased , simply because the density of electrons becomes smaller and the electrons do not encounter each other very often .    as we pointed out above , the ce - phase is orbitally ordered , but charge is homogeneously distributed between corner and bridge sites if coulomb interactions are neglected .",
    "it is well known that longer - range coulomb interactions ( for instance a nearest neighbor interaction ) can cause charge ordering , especially at commensurate filling .",
    "a surprising observation , however , is that the experimentally observed charge order can be directly obtained from the degenerate double - exchange model when only the coulomb interaction ( the hubbard @xmath83 ) between electrons in different orbitals , but _ on the same site _ is included  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that in the band picture on the corner sites both orthogonal orbitals are partially occupied , but on the bridge sites only one orbital is partially filled .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction acts therefore differently on the corner and bridge sites : charge is pushed away from the effectively correlated corner sites to the effectively uncorrelated bridge - sites .",
    "the on - site hubbard @xmath83 thus leads to intersite charge disproportionation .",
    "long - range coulomb interactions will of course strengthen this charge ordering , and the jahn - teller distortion , which lowers the on - site energy of the bridge orbital with respect to the corners , also contributes to the ordering . whereas the effect of @xmath83 is to increase the ground state energy with respect to the c - phase  @xcite ( which is made up of straight ferromagnetic chains )",
    ", the longer - range coulomb interactions will stabilize the ce - phase .",
    "this indicates that there are several competing kinetic , potential and lattice contributions to the total energy and that one needs to consider these in detail to determine the actual phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "now we qualitatively discuss the role of orbital degrees of freedom in the overdoped regime , @xmath32 .",
    "the main question is why the conventional double exchange , apparently responsible for the formation of the ferromagnetic metallic state for @xmath181  @xmath182 , does not lead to such a state in this case .",
    "one reason may be the following .",
    "usually we ascribe ferromagnetism in doped systems to a tendency to gain kinetic energy by maximal delocalization of doped charge carriers .",
    "these carriers are holes in lightly doped manganites @xmath183 , and electrons when we start e.g.  from camno@xmath8 and substitute part of ca by la or other rare earths , which corresponds to @xmath184 in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 .",
    "there exist an important difference between these two cases , however .",
    "when we dope lamno@xmath8 , the orbital degeneracy in the ground state is already lifted by orbital ordering , and in a first approximation we can consider the motion of doped holes in a nondegenerate band .",
    "then all the standard treatment , e.g. that of de  gennes  @xcite , applies , and we get the fm state . however , when we start from the cubic camno@xmath8 , we put extra electrons into empty _",
    "@xmath10-levels , which form degenerate bands .",
    "therefore we have to generalize the conventional double - exchange model to the case of degenerate bands .",
    "this was done in  @xcite , and the outcome is the following : at relatively low electron concentration ( @xmath185 ) the anisotropic magnetic structures c - type ( chain - like ) or a - type ( ferromagnetic planes stacked antiferromagnetically) are stabilized , and only close to @xmath186 we reach the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the c - phase occupies larger part of the phase space .",
    "the resulting theoretical phase diagram  @xcite is in surprisingly good agreement with the properties of nd@xmath6sr@xmath7 mno@xmath8  @xcite in which there exist the a - type `` bad metal '' phase for @xmath187 and c - phase for @xmath188 .",
    "a simple qualitative explanation of this tendency is the following .",
    "when we start from camno@xmath8 with mn@xmath189 ( @xmath190)-ions and dope it by electrons , we put electrons into @xmath10-bands .",
    "the maximum energy we can gain is to put these electrons at the bottom of corresponding bands , so that one has to make these bands as broad as possible . but due to a specific character of the overlap of different @xmath10-orbitals in different directions , the bottom of the bands coincides for different types of orbitals : one can easily check that if we make all the orbitals e.g.  @xmath78 , the energy @xmath191 at the @xmath192-point @xmath193 will be the same as for the bands made of ( @xmath194)-orbitals .",
    "( actually it is a consequence of the degeneracy of @xmath10-orbitals in cubic crystals : the symmetry at the @xmath192-point should coincide with the point symmetry of local orbitals , i.e.  at @xmath193 the energies of the @xmath78-band and of the @xmath195 one , or of a band made of any linear combinations thereof of the type  ( 1 ) , should coincide . )    but according to the double - exchange model electrons can move only if localized moments ( @xmath16-spins ) of the corresponding sites are ordered ferromagnetically ( although without doping , in camno@xmath8 ( @xmath196 ) , the magnetic ordering is antiferromagnetic ( g - type ) ) .",
    "now , if we make the band e.g.  out of ( @xmath194)-orbitals , the band dispersion would have the form @xmath197 i.e.  the electrons in this band move only in the @xmath25-plane , but there is no dispersion in the @xmath86-direction .",
    "therefore to gain full kinetic energy it is enough to make this plane ferromagnetic , and the adjacent planes may well remain antiparallel to the first one . but this is just the a - type magnetic structure ( ferromagnetic planes stacked antiferromagnetically ) . in this state",
    "we gain the same energy as in a fully ferromagnetic state ( because the position of the bottom of the band is the same ) , but lose less exchange energy of localized @xmath16-electrons , because two out of six bonds for each mn are still antiferromagnetic .",
    "the same applies also to the c - type ordering , where four out of six bonds are antiferromagnetic .",
    "this explains why in the case of double exchange via degenerate orbitals realized in overdoped manganites predominantly these partly ferromagnetic ( a - type and c - type ) occur instead of full ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "note that in this case the electron occupy predominantly @xmath195-states ( or @xmath78-states in case of c - type ordering ) .",
    "accordingly there will be a corresponding lattice distortion ( compression along @xmath77-axis , @xmath198 , for the a - type structure , and @xmath199 for the c - type one ) .",
    "but we want to stress that these are , strictly speaking , not the localized orbitals , but rather the _ bands _ of corresponding character .",
    "whether we should call it orbital ordering , is a matter of convention ( usually this terminology is applied to the case of localized orbitals ) . in any case , the feature mentioned above ( @xcite ) , that due to higher - order effects , in particular lattice anharmonicity , only locally elongated meo@xmath13-octahedra are observed in practice , is valid only for orbital ordering of _ localized _ orbitals , and it is in general not true for the band situation considered here .",
    "thus the double exchange via degenerate orbitals may quite naturally lead to anisotropic magnetic structures ( a - type or c - type ) : we gain by that the full kinetic energy without being forced to sacrifice all the exchange interaction of localized electrons ( part of the bonds remain antiferromagnetic ) . which particular state will be stable at which part of the phase diagram , is determined by the competition between these terms , kinetic energy versus exchange energy , with the electron energy depending on the band filling and sensitive to the density of states for the corresponding band .",
    "there are several factors which can complicate this picture .",
    "thus , one may in principle get in this case canted states , and not the fully saturated a- or c - type structures  @xcite",
    ". there may also appear inhomogeneous phase - separated states .",
    "the possibility of the charge ordering ( e.g.  in the form of stripes ) was also not considered in  @xcite .",
    "but altogether it shows that the conventional double - exchange picture should be modified if double - exchange goes via degenerate orbitals , and the overall tendency which results due to this is that not the simple ferromagnetic state , but more complicated magnetic structures may be stabilized , which agrees with the general tendency observed in experiment .",
    "this factor may be important in explaining the strong qualitative asymmetry of the phase diagram of manganites for @xmath200 ( underdoped ) and @xmath201 ( overdoped ) regimes .",
    "it is very interesting that stripes ( and possibly bistripes ) were observed in overdoped manganites  @xcite , notably in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 for @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "orbital degrees of freedom seem to play an important role in their formation as well .",
    "the structure of the stripe and bistripe phases , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] , resembles somewhat that of the ce - phase at @xmath63 .",
    "ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 for @xmath204 .",
    "mn@xmath22 ions denoted by o and mn@xmath0 ions by @xmath205 , @xmath206 . ]",
    "the physical mechanism of the stripe formation in manganites could in principle be similar to that involved in the cuprates  @xcite , i.e. coupling between charge and spin degrees of freedom . in manganites , however , stripes are usually formed at temperatures above those of magnetic ordering . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] , stripes in this case also imply a specific orbital ordering .",
    "we may think that orbital degrees of freedom and the corresponding lattice distortions strongly contribute to the very formation of stripes .",
    "one can indeed show that the states with a particular orbital orientation attract another , which can provide a mechanism for stripe formation  @xcite . as a result , depending on the values of parameters , both the single and paired stripe phases may be stabilized in overdoped manganites due to this effect  @xcite that heavily relies on the presence of orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "in conclusion we can only repeat that orbital effects play a very important role in the physics of manganites , and also in many other transition metal oxides . together with charge and spin degrees of freedom",
    "they determine all the rich variety of the properties of manganites in different doping regions .",
    "orbital effects also play a very important role in disordered phases , determining to a large extent their transport and other properties .",
    "an important recent achievement in this field is the development of a method to directly study orbital ordering using resonant x - ray scattering  @xcite .",
    "this method was successfully applied to a number of problems in manganites  @xcite as well as to several other systems .",
    "and although there is still a controversy as to the detailed microscopic explanation of these observations  @xcite , this method will be definitely of great use in the future .",
    "another interesting new development is the observation of orbital excitations in lamno@xmath8 .",
    "and although many questions here still remain unclear , the recent experimental progress will definitely open a new chapter in the study of orbital effects in oxides , in particular in manganites .    in our review",
    "we left out several effects for which orbital degrees of freedom also may play an important role , e.g. phase separation  @xcite or short - range correlations above the ferromagnetic ordering temperature  @xcite .",
    "all these problems are now under active investigation , and the results will definitively shed new light on the physics of manganites , including the phenomenon of colossal magneto - resistance . in summary , we see that the field of orbital physics is still capable of producing important new results , and sometimes surprises .",
