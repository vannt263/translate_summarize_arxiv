    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is an asymptotically free theory @xcite and regarded as the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons . at very high energies ,",

    "the perturbative qcd predictions have been extensively confirmed by experiments , while qcd in the non - perturbative regime is still a challenge to theorists .",
    "the fundamental quarks and gluons of qcd have not been seen as free particles , but are always confined within hadrons .",
    "it is still difficult to construct the hadrons in terms of nearly massless quarks and gluons .",
    "the observed baryon spectrum indicates that the ( approximate ) chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum . as a result , the eight pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are light pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons , and the constituent quark obtains dynamical mass , which contributes to the baryon mass .",
    "besides conventional mesons and baryons , qcd itself does not exclude the existence of the non - conventional states such as glueballs , hybrid mesons and multi - quark states @xcite .",
    "since 1970s , people have been interested in qcd at extreme conditions .",
    "it is expected that the chiral symmetry can be restored , and quarks and gluons will become deconfined at high temperatures and/or densities @xcite . fig .",

    "it is believed that the  little bang \" can be produced at rhic and lhc .",
    "recently , it was shown that the new state of matter produced at rhic is far away from the asymptotically hot qgp , but in a strongly coupled regime .",

    "studying qcd at finite baryon density is the traditional subject of nuclear physics .",
    "the behaviour of qcd at finite baryon density and low temperature is central for astrophysics to understand the structure of compact stars , and conditions near the core of collapsing stars ( supernovae , hypernovae ) .",

    "this was proposed by frautschi @xcite and barrois @xcite . based on the bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite , because there is a weak attractive interaction in the color antitriplet channel , the system is unstable with respect to the formation of particle - particle cooper - pair condensate in the momentum space .",

    "they concluded that the one - gluon exchange induces gaps on the order of 1 @xmath7 at several times of nuclear matter density .",
    "this small gap has little effect on cold dense quark matter , thus the investigation of cold quark matter lay dormant for several decades .",
    "it was only revived recently when it was found that the color superconducting gap can be of the order of @xmath8 @xcite , which is two orders larger than early perturbative estimates in ref .",

    "it was expected that deconfined quark matter formed at high temperature should behave like a gas of weakly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( wqgp ) .",
    "the perturbative qcd calculation gives a large shear viscosity in the wqgp with @xmath17 for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it turned out as a surprise that the rhic data of elliptic flow @xmath19 can be described very well by requiring a very small shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath20 @xcite . lattice qcd calculation confirmed that @xmath20 for the purely gluonic plasma is rather small and in the range of @xmath21 @xcite .",
