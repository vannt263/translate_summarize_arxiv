    "catalogs of nearby stars @xcite and high proper motion stars @xcite are grossly deficient in very low mass ( vlm ) dwarfs . with spectral types of m7 and later , these objects , sometimes called `` ultracool m dwarfs , '' are so optically faint that even nearby ones eluded searches based on the older ( pre-1980s ) sky surveys .",
    "these dwarfs have particular importance because they lie at or below the hydrogen burning limit  and have proven not only to be estimators of the numbers of dark brown dwarfs , but also present interesting astrophysical challenges in their own right .",
    "the new generation of sky surveys allows this deficiency to be addressed and large samples of nearby vlm dwarfs to be identified .",
    "the two micron all - sky survey ( skrutskie et al . , in prep . ; hereafter 2mass ) provides reliable photometry in the jhk@xmath5 passbands , close to the peak of emission for these cool dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , the second palomar sky survey @xcite , hereafter poss ii ) provides b@xmath6,r@xmath7 , and i@xmath8 photographic photometry in the northern hemisphere . in the southern hemisphere ,",
    "the uk schmidt and eso sky survey plates provide @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitudes . in sum , it is becoming possible to identify both the least luminous stars and young massive brown dwarfs by their optical and near - infrared colors alone over most of the sky .",
    "we present first results of a search using near - infrared and optical sky survey data aimed at completing the nearby star catalog for the ultracool m dwarfs .",
    "we discuss the sample selection and spectroscopic followup in section  [ data ] .",
    "although the sample discussed in this paper includes only a small fraction of the total population of nearby ultracool dwarfs , it represents a fourfold increase in the number of such sources known .",
    "we discuss some preliminary results concerning the statistical properties of these sources in the latter sections of this paper .",
    "we discuss some stars of special interest in section  [ special ] and the 2mass colors of ultracool m dwarfs in section  [ colors ] .",
    "the local space density of vlm dwarfs is discussed in section  [ lf ] , their activity and kinematics are discussed in section  [ activity ] , and finally our conclusions and future prospects are discussed in  [ summary ] .",
    "our results are based on three observational samples . for our initial observing run , in july 1998 , we used both photometric and proper motion criteria to define a sample of candidate vlm dwarfs .",
    "based on the results from this run and further experience analyzing 2mass data , we were able to improve our selection criteria for our december 1998 and subsequent observing runs .",
    "there are thus three samples with different properties , and when necessary we distinguish them as `` sample a '' ( july 1998 ) , `` sample b '' ( december 1998 ) , and `` sample c '' ( june 1999 ) respectively .",
    "samples b and c have nearly identical selection criteria , and when combined are refered to as sample bc . in all samples , objects within 20 degrees of the galactic plane were excluded .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all the analysis in section  [ lf ] and  [ activity ] is based on sample bc .",
    "sample a was based on 2mass data processed by july 1998 .",
    "all these data were obtained at the mt .",
    "hopkins 2mass telescope and a total of 363 square degrees were searched . all objects classified as extended by the 2mass pipeline",
    "were eliminated ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 2mass data were correlated with the usno s pmm scans of the poss ii plates , using a preliminary version of the software used by the 2mass rare objects core project ( this software will be described in more detail in a future publication by monet et al . ) .",
    "this provided three additional colors : b@xmath6 , r@xmath11 , and i@xmath8 .",
    "zero - point calibrations for the poss ii scans were not available , but we have since found that rough zero - points ( good to @xmath12 magnitudes ) are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "these do not account for plate - to - plate variations or the significant color terms expected in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "all objects that met the following criteria were observed :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 k@xmath17 2 .",
    "@xmath18 j - k@xmath19 3 .   no b@xmath6 detection 4 .",

    "the magnitude of the observed positional offset between the 2mass and poss ii source is compared to the distribution of all 2mass - poss ii correlations .",
    "only objects with significant proper motion were selected .",
    "thus , while we selected sources that are moving with high confidence ( roughly @xmath23 ) , the actual cutoff in terms of arcseconds per year depends on the epoch difference between the f plate and 2mass , which varies between 0 and @xmath24 years .    as shown in section  [ spectra",
    "] , these criteria led to the identification of a number of new nearby m dwarfs , but they are flawed in some respects .",
    "first , the poss ii and ukst iiia j plates are sufficiently sensitive that many nearby ( bright ) vlm dwarfs are detected .",
    "moreover , the blue cutoff in j - k@xmath5 allowed mid - m dwarfs to enter the sample .",
    "we selected this blue cutoff because the prototypical m7 dwarf vb 8 has j - k@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , m dwarfs between spectral type m0 and m6.5 all have j - k@xmath26 , and , with uncertainties of @xmath27 mag , significant numbers are scattered to j - k@xmath28 .",
    "consequently , our initial attempts to select ultracool m dwarfs produced a sample which is heavily contaminated by distant mid - m dwarfs .",
    "as it turned out , there were no 2mass sources meeting our color and magnitude cuts that were not paired with a poss ii source in sample a.    based on experience gained from this analysis , we revised our sample selection for the december 1998 observing run . because a larger area was available , we focused on brighter vlm dwarfs which should lie within @xmath29 parsecs .",

    "degrees were searched .",
    "the j - k@xmath5 cutoff excludes early and mid - m dwarfs , but also some of the bluer m7 dwarfs .",
    "nearby bright l dwarfs , however , are included in these samples , since we impose no red cutoff .",
    "both samples are magnitude selected , and therefore are biased towards overluminous stars and unresolved near - equal luminosity binaries , although binaries with separations of a few arcseconds may be excluded by the extended source provision .",
    "the position selection is due to the requirement that the objects be observable from las campanas in december .",
    "ultracool m dwarfs have r - k@xmath38 and i - k@xmath39 @xcite , but we used a more liberal selection to allow for uncertainties in the calibration of the photographic magnitudes . in section  [ colors ] , we show that r - k@xmath40 includes all m8 and later dwarfs .",
    "the j - h , h - k cut excludes m giants .",

    "a few targets ( including all three objects with j - k@xmath47 , which had been previously identified as l dwarf candidates ) were observed during keck observing runs ( see kirkpatrick et al .",

    "the wavelength coverage was 6140   to 9200    using the 2048 ccd , but the extreme ends of the spectra were out of focus .",
    "a few objects were observed at palomar 200-in . in may 1999 .",
    "the four new l dwarfs identified with the kitt peak data were reobserved at higher signal - to - noise using keck in july 1998 .",
    "the spectral measurements used for classification on the k99 system are given in table  [ table - ldwarfs ] .",

    "fluxes were measured assuming the data were photometric ( there were no clouds for our observations in december 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that bc@xmath48 as derived by @xcite for ultracool m dwarfs .",
    "we believe the h@xmath2 fluxes should be viewed with caution since slit losses and the high airmass of many of the observations will increase the uncertainties ( the spectrograph was not adjusted to the parallactic angle ) . however , our derived h@xmath2 to bolometric luminosity ratios are consistent with those of tr , and in any case the h@xmath2 emission strength is variable in these dwarfs . in table",
    "[ table - fluxes ] , we list our measured and derived parameters for the ultracool dwarfs in sample bc .",
    "proper motions were estimated by measuring positions off the dss ( poss i / ukst j ) and xdss ( poss ii / ukst r ) images of the photographic sky surveys . when a second epoch photographic sky survey was not available , we used the 2mass images instead .",
    "all motions reported are relative to other stars in the field , but the correction to absolute motions is negligible compared to other sources of error in the kinematics . the proper motion reported for lhs2397a is from @xcite and bri1222 - 1222 is from @xcite . note that all of our targets are visible on the dss images , but most were previously unrecognized .",
    "the targets which had no poss ii pairings in our initial processing all proved to have high proper motions .",
    "they are visible on the xdss but lie outside the 8 arcsecond search radius employed in cross - referencing against the photographic data . since the 2mass positions are highly accurate , and both the 2mass images and dss images are ( or will shortly be ) easily accessible electronically , we are not presenting finding charts .    using the available parallaxes for late - type dwarfs @xcite , we find ( figure  [ fig - jkmk ] ) the linear fit @xmath49 j - k@xmath5 this fit is only valid for m7 and later dwarfs over the color range @xmath50 j - k@xmath51 , and",
    "should be modified as more l dwarf parallaxes are measured at usno .",
    "the observed scatter is @xmath52 magnitudes .",
    "the distances and tangential velocities derived using this estimate are listed in table  [ table - fluxes ] .",
    "we caution , however , that the distances derived for many of the m7 and m7.5 dwarfs may be underestimated in this paper .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig - jkmk ] , the main sequence bends sharply at spectral type m7 .",
    "our selection of only targets with j - k@xmath53 tends to select m6 s and m7 s with overestimated colors , while a spectral classification error of only 0.5 subclasses from m6.5 to m7.0 leads to a large error in @xmath54 .",
    "a few of the targets deserve special comment",
    ". our search has identified one very nearby star and a number of very high proper motion dwarfs .",
    "the m8.0 dwarf 2massw j0027559 + 221932 has a photometric parallax that places it within ten parsecs ; given the uncertainties , it may lie within the eight parsec sample .",
    "we note also that a number of dwarfs in table  [ table - fluxes ] have motions greater than 1 arcsecond per year , but do not appear in the lhs catalog even though they are visible on the poss plates .",
    "seven l dwarfs are part of our sample bc .",
    "the l5 dwarf 2massw j1507476 - 162738 , also in @xcite , was selected for this project but does not lie in the sample bc area .",
    "additional observations and discussion of 2massi j0746425 + 200032 , 2massw j0036159 + 182110 and 2massw j1439283 + 192915 are given in @xcite .",
    "2massw j1439283 + 192915 is in the original k99 paper while 2massw j0036159 + 182110 was observed at keck for the k00 paper .",
    "2massw j1300425 + 191235 is particularly surprising : it has the j - k@xmath5 color of an m8 dwarf but has an l1 spectrum .",
    "it will be discussed further in an additional paper , but we note here that the estimated distance and tangential velocity is based on the j - k@xmath5 color and should be viewed with great caution .",
    "nevertheless , it apparently has a high velocity , and is likely to be old .",
    "while we report photometric distance estimates only , most of these dwarfs are on the usno parallax program and accurate distances should be forthcoming .    since our selection is based upon photometry only , we are sensitive to wide binary pairs where the 2mass observations of the secondaries are unaffected by the primaries .",
    "two m dwarf secondaries that do not meet the spatial restrictions and were specially observed have been reported in @xcite .",
    "one of the sample c ultracool m dwarfs also appears to be a secondary .",
    "the m8.0 dwarf 2massw j2331016 - 040618 is 447 arcseconds west and 65 arcseconds south of the f8 dwarf hd 221356 .",
    "our photometric parallax of 26.3 parsecs for the m dwarf is consistent with hipparcos trigonometric parallax of 26.24 parcsecs @xcite , as are the observed proper motions .",
    "this is apparently a wide binary system with separation of 0.057 parsecs .",
    "the f8 primary may provide a useful age and composition constraint on the m dwarf .",
    "two of our sources have been previously identified as candidate hyades members .",
    "lp 475 - 855 has been discussed as an hyades candidate by @xcite although it was rejected as too bright by @xcite .",
    "our photometry supports the latter conclusion , although conceivably it could be a foreground ( escaping ? ) hyades member if it is an unresolved equal - mass binary .",
    "our initial observation of this star found it in a flare state , with h@xmath2 equivalent width of 40  .",
    "a 25 december 1998 keck spectrum found h@xmath2 of only 7  , which is the value we report in table  [ table - data ] .",
    "lp 415 - 20 ( bryja 262 ) has been extensively discussed as a hyades member and has been classified as an m6.5 dwarf @xcite .",
    "the difference in spectral types is within our uncertainties , and we note that vo is visible in bryja s plot of the spectrum . the poor distance estimate for this object is consistent with our belief that our m7 distances based on j - k@xmath5 colors are unreliable and should be viewed with caution .",
    "in figure  [ fig - jkrk ] , we plot the r - k@xmath5,j - k@xmath5 diagram for sample b. we concluded that adjusting our color criterion to r@xmath11-k@xmath40 would increase our selection efficiency without losing m8 and later dwarfs , and we adopted this selection criterion for sample c. this observation is consistent with our estimate that our simple @xmath10 zero - point is good to @xmath12 magnitudes .",
    "our observations show a good correlation between the far - red spectral type and the 2mass near - ir colors . in figure",
    "[ fig - histjk ] , we plot the observed j - k@xmath5 color distribution as a function of spectral type . as expected , the m7.0 and m7.5 distributions are truncated by our requirement that j - k@xmath55 .",
    "the histograms suggest that of order one m8-m8.5 dwarf may be expected to be missed due to this requirement , and it appears that it is very unlikely than any ( normal ) m9 dwarfs are missed .",
    "2mass photometry for these bright sources is expected to be good to 0.03 magnitudes .    in figure",
    "[ fig - jhhk ] , we plot the 2mass near - infrared color - color diagram for our sample . it is evident that the m / l dwarf sequence lies well below our imposed j - h , h - k cut , and therefore we are not missing ultracool m dwarfs due to this criteria .",
    "we fit the relation @xmath56 assuming the errors in each color are 0.042 and including the m7.0 to m9.5 dwarfs .",
    "this relation may be convenient as a representative sequence in the 2mass color system .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dwarfs around ( h - k , j - h ) @xmath57 are nearly all classified as m7-m7.5 dwarfs , while the dwarfs at ( h - k , j - h ) @xmath58 but with similar j - k@xmath5 colors are nearly all classified as m8-m8.5 dwarfs .",
    "this may reflect some relation between the red - optical region ( dominated by tio and vo , and influenced by dust ) and the ir colors ( dominated by h@xmath59o and h@xmath59 , and also influenced by dust )  or it is due to some subtle bias in our classifications or photometry ( for example , perhaps we tend to select m7 dwarfs whose h - k@xmath5 color has been overestimated ) .",
    "note that one of the outliers below the normal j - h , h - k@xmath5 relation is the peculiar l dwarf 2massw j1300425 + 191235 .",
    "our sample bc is the first large sample of bright , photometrically selected ultracool m dwarfs . using our data and derived distances",
    ", we can estimate the luminosity function using schmidt s ( 1968 ) @xmath60 technique .",
    "the space density is @xmath61 @xmath62 in our case , k@xmath63 and @xmath64 sq . degrees .",
    "the corresponding variance is @xmath65    the space densities are given in table  [ table - lf ] .",
    "we derive a space density of @xmath1 ultracool m dwarfs per cubic parsec . according to our adopted color - magnitude relation ,",
    "this is for dwarfs in the range @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding luminosity function bin is @xmath67 dwarfs per cubic parsec per k magnitude . since",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath68 for these late dwarfs , this may be represented in bolometric magnitudes as @xmath69 dwarfs per cubic parsec per bolometric magnitude .",
    "we note , however , that this value excludes the m7 dwarfs which will also contribute near m@xmath70 , so our value is a lower limit .",
    "the space density for the early l dwarfs is half that of the ultracool m dwarfs , although we caution that the distance estimate for 2m1300 may be incorrect .",
    "schmidt s statistic measures the uniformity of the density distribution of a sample , effectively providing an estimate of sample completeness . for a uniform sample , @xmath71 with an uncertainty of @xmath72 where n is the number of stars observed . both our l dwarf and m8.0-m8.5 sample lie within 1 @xmath73 of this value , suggesting that we are complete .",
    "the value for m9.0 to m9.5 dwarfs is more problematic , indicating that we have either excluded a few nearby , very bright m9 dwarfs , or that there happen to be no such very nearby dwarfs in our survey volume .",
    "our space density for the ultracool m dwarfs is consistent with tinney s ( 1993 ) value of @xmath74 dwarfs per cubic parsec per bolometric magnitude , which was based on selection with r@xmath11 and i@xmath8 photographic magnitudes but k followup of all vlm dwarfs to improve photometric parallaxes .",
    "only 6 dwarfs contributed to this bin , accounting for tinney s larger uncertainty relative to our sample . @xcite",
    "have analyzed the denis mini - survey and found 19 m8 and later dwarfs , including 3 l dwarfs .",
    "they do not estimate the m dwarf space density , but use the three l dwarfs to estimate @xmath75 dwarfs per cubic parsec per bolometric magnitude .",
    "we note that their estimated @xmath54 for the ultracool m dwarfs are inconsistent with our adopted values ( and figure  [ fig - jkmk ] ) since they consider their m8-m9 dwarfs to have @xmath76 .",
    "malmquist bias will affect our sample .",
    "@xcite have shown that the luminosity function will be overestimated by : @xmath77\\ ] ] a model luminosity function can be used to derive the first and second derivatives .",
    "the scatter of parallax stars about the linear fit adopted here is @xmath78 . adopting this value for @xmath73 , and making the assumption that the luminosity function is flat",
    ", we find that @xmath79 : i.e. , the values we derive overestimate the true space densities by @xmath80 .",
    "since this is only a preliminary sample , we defer further analysis of the malquist bias , as well as the effect of unresolved binaries , until additional data are available . in the long term , trigonometric parallaxes and searches for",
    "companions will allow this issue to be addressed directly .    our derived space density",
    "can best be compared to the luminosity function of nearby stars .",
    "figure  [ fig - klf ] plots the @xcite ( @xmath81 ) luminosity function for stars within eight parsecs with our m8.0-l4.5 data point added to it .",
    "our results suggest that the dropoff seen in for the faintest ( @xmath82 ) dwarfs in the eight parsec sample is in part due to incompleteness . applying standard mass - luminosity relations to @xmath83",
    "derived from the 8-parsec sample implies a turnover in the mass function close to the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "there is , however , no reason to expect the star formation process to be cognizant of the mass limit for hydrogen burning . @xcite have modelled a sample of twenty 2mass and and three denis l dwarfs and conclude that the substellar mass function is consistent with an extension of the power - law matched to data for stars with masses between 0.1 and @xmath84 .",
    "the higher space densities measured for ultracool dwarfs in this paper suggest a greater degree of continuity across the stellar / substellar boundary .",
    "continuation of the present survey should identify the missing dwarfs within eight parsecs .",
    "if compared to the classical `` photometric '' luminosity functions @xcite which have a peak at @xmath85 and a dropoff to @xmath86 , then our data would imply a rise in the luminosity function at the stellar / substellar boundary . however , this peak and dropoff are an artifact of the data analysis due to the incorrect assumption of a linear color - magnitude relation @xcite and/or other systematic errors such as unresolved binaries @xcite .",
    "we believe that the nearby - star sample is a better comparison for our sample , and we emphasize again that the m dwarfs here identified require follow - up trigonometric parallax determinations and high - resolution imaging and radial velocity searches for companions to produce a definitive luminosity function .",
    "the bc sample was not selected on the basis of proper motions , and therefore is ( relatively ) unbiased in terms of kinematics .",
    "it is useful to review the properties of nearby disk stars and the already - known properties of ultracool m dwarfs before discussing our kinematic and activity measurements .",
    "stars are born with low space velocity dispersions and and high chromospheric activity levels . over time , the space velocity of the stars increases as they interact with the galactic disk . using bafgk dwarfs with known ages , @xcite showed that the total space velocity increases from @xmath87 km / s at mean ages of 0.4 to @xmath88 yr to 34 km / s at @xmath89 yr to @xmath90 km / s at @xmath91 yrs .",
    "the high chromospheric activity levels of young stars with convective envelopes is attributed to a dynamo which is driven by rotation . as the star ages , angular momentum loss through the the stellar wind spins down the star , causing the chromospheric activity to in turn decrease .",
    "@xcite did indeed find that emission line strength in m dwarfs was related to kinematics , with older stars showing less activity and higher space velocities .",
    "as progressively less massive ( later spectral type ) stars are considered , the observed frequency of high h@xmath2 activity increases .",
    "this is _ not _ due only to the fact that h@xmath2 emission is more detectable against the cool photosphere ",
    "* hereafter hgr ) showed that the percentage of highly active m dwarfs increases with cooler spectral types even when h@xmath2 activity is compared to the star s bolometric luminosity .",
    "the increased lifetime of activity is confirmed by observations of open clusters @xcite .",
    "the connection to rotation in early m dwarfs is confirmed by @xcite , who have found that the incidence of rapid rotators is higher among cooler m dwarfs , and that the rapid rotators are active .",
    "there is some evidence that the rotation - activity relation is breaking down @xcite . in summary ,",
    "mid - m dwarfs maintain h @xmath2 emission for billions of years as they slowly spin down .",
    "kinematics are a good age indicator , but only in a statistical sense  individual stars can not be accurately dated by the velocities .    for the ultracool",
    "m dwarfs , there is considerable evidence that the standard stellar age - activity and rotation - activity relations no longer apply .",
    "@xcite found that the m9.5 dwarf bri 0021 - 0214 had very rapid rotation ( @xmath92 km / s ) but little h@xmath2 activity .",
    "tr have shown that the lithium m9 brown dwarf lp 944 - 20 @xcite is also a member of this class of `` inactive , rapid rotators '' as are the two of the denis l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "tr argue that observations of these field objects as well as open clusters indicate that the violation of the age - activity connection is primarily correlated with mass ( the physical mechanisms remain unknown ) .",
    "@xcite reports that rapid rotation is more common among objects of lower luminosity , and proposes that the h@xmath2 activity is powered by a turbulent dynamo that is quenched at high rotation rates .",
    "there is some evidence that even among the `` inactive , rapid rotators '' @xmath93 is related to age , as it decreases from @xmath94 for the pleiades to @xmath95 for @xmath96 yr brown dwarfs . this trend may be true for younger ages , since the very low mass ( @xmath97 ) , very young ( @xmath98 myr ) m8.5 brown dwarf @xmath99 oph 162349.8 - 242601 has @xmath100   @xcite , while the young ( @xmath101 myr ) , possible brown dwarfs ( @xmath102 ) v410 tau x3 ( m8.5 ) and x6 ( m6 ) have @xmath103    @xcite .",
    "both imply higher activity levels than their older pleiades and field counterparts , though it should be noted that they are also lower mass .",
    "in contrast to the `` inactive , rapid rotators , '' some ultracool m dwarfs do show h@xmath2 emission , but they have lower rotation rates ( @xmath104 km / s , tr ) . however , even a rotation rate of @xmath105 km / s is adequate to maintain h@xmath2 emission in mid - m dwarfs @xcite , so the limits on the `` low '' rotation rates of these ultracool m dwarfs are not surprising by comparison .",
    "a so - far unique field object is the m9.5 dwarf pc 0025 + 0447 @xcite , whose quiescent h@xmath2 emission ( @xmath106  ) is comparable to highly active mid - m dwarfs in terms of @xmath107 .",
    "the nature of this object and its emission is uncertain  @xcite argue that this object is a very young brown dwarf , suggesting that the usno parallax indicating ordinary ultracool m dwarf luminosity is incorrect .",
    "some of the known m8-m9 dwarfs are definitely brown dwarfs . the `` inactive , rapid rotator '' m9 dwarf lp 944 - 20 has lithium absorption and a luminosity that indicates it has a mass between 0.056 and 0.064 @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the pleiades brown dwarfs teide 1 and calar 3 have spectral types of m8 , lithium absorption , and anomalous vo and na features due to low - surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the bc sample of ultracool m dwarfs provides the first opportunity for a thorough investigation of the distribution of activity in these vlm dwarfs . in figure  [ fig - percentha ]",
    ", we compare the percentage of ultracool m dwarfs observed in emission to the hgr statistics for nearby k7 to m6.5 dwarfs .",
    "note that that @xmath109 to @xmath110 dwarfs contribute to each of the hgr bins up to spectral type m4.5 .",
    "only a few objects contribute to the m6.0 and m6.5 bins , which also are probably kinematically biased against young , active stars due to incompleteness in the pcns3 .",
    "we extend our m dwarf sample to even cooler dwarfs by using the k99 and k00 data , who report the strength of h@xmath2 emission in their l dwarfs .",
    "their sample is photometrically - selected and kinematically unbiased .",
    "the sample shows a steady decline in h@xmath2 emission frequency from 60% ( 80% if a marginal detection is included ) for type l0 down to only 8% ( 25% if two marginal detections are included ) for l4 dwarfs .",
    "none of the twenty dwarfs with spectral type l5.0 or later show definite emission ( two have marginal detections ) . for the earlier dwarfs ,",
    "emission of 1   equivalent width would have been detected in almost all the objects ; however , the upper limit on the equivalent widths for the latest l dwarfs was typically somwhat larger .",
    "the fact that there is so little photospheric continuum for the latest l dwarfs around the h@xmath2 feature should compensate for the lower sensitivity in terms in equivalent widths .",
    "the data indicate that the frequency of emission increases with later spectral type ( cooler temperatures ) , until at spectral type m7 all of our targets show detectable emission . indeed , we are not aware of _ any _ inactive m7 dwarfs ( hgr ; gizis & reid 1997 ) .",
    "this indicates that the dwarfs can maintain detectable levels of activity for the lifetime of the galactic disk .",
    "later than m7 , the h@xmath2 emission frequency begins to decrease , with our sample of ultracool m dwarfs merging cleanly with the l dwarfs .",
    "this coincides with the breakdown of the rotation - activity relation already noted for m9 and l dwarfs and reflects the apparent relative inability of the ultracool m dwarfs to heat the chromosphere discussed by tr .",
    "the percentage of emission at spectral type m6 is particularly uncertain , as the hgr sample may be biased toward higher velocity , hence older , stars at such low luminosities .",
    "sixteen of our nineteen m6-m6.5 dwarfs show emission , but they have been effectively selected on the basis of unusually red @xmath111 colors , and may be biased in some way . in any case , there is little doubt that some high velocity , presumably very old , m6 dwarfs are no longer active .",
    "since the h@xmath2 line is seen against an increasingly faint photosphere for these ultracool dwarfs , the @xmath93 ratio is more indicative of the true level of activity .",
    "we plot our m dwarfs , the hgr early m dwarfs , and the k99 l dwarf data in figure  [ fig - sp - habol ] . for the k99 data",
    ", we have measured the continuum level off the observed spectra and assumed @xmath112 as measured by tinney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for gd 165b to convert the k99 equivalent widths to flux ratios .",
    "note that the increase in maximum observed activity levels from k7 to the peak at m3-m5 reflects the increased lifetime of emission for the lower mass stars .",
    "earlier m dwarfs with activity levels near -3 are known in young clusters , but do not have long enough lifetimes to appear in the local sample .",
    "the lower envelope of data points is set by the fact that the minimum observable h@xmath2 emission of 1  equivalent width corresponds to a lower luminosity fraction in cooler dwarfs .",
    "the addition of our data to the hgr data clearly indicates that beyond m7 the level of activity is indeed declining .",
    "this decline continues for lower ( l dwarf ) temperatures .",
    "the decline is quite steep  in only three subclasses ( m8 to l1 ) the activity drops by one full dex .",
    "@xcite note a `` slight trend toward decreasing emission in the l dwarfs ''  our conclusions differ due to our larger sample and their use of equivalent widths only .",
    "while the quiescent h@xmath2 chromospheric activity is declining , our data suggest that flare activity is common in the ultracool m dwarfs , and may be a significant contributor to the activity energy budget .",
    "we summarize evidence for variability in table  [ table - flares ] .",
    "since these events represent a strong enhancement of the h@xmath2 line strength , we suggest that they may be flares .",
    "at least a few dwarfs apparently maintain strong quiescent emission ",
    "our h@xmath2 line strength of 29    for lp412 - 31 is identical with the value observed by @xcite .",
    "other ultracool m dwarfs not in our sample have been seen to flare ",
    "@xcite recently observed a flare on the `` inactive '' dwarf bri 0021 - 0214 , while @xcite observed the h - alpha ew of lhs 2065 on two consecutive nights as 7.5    then 20.3  .",
    "@xcite have observed flares in a number of ultracool m dwarfs . flaring activity",
    "has thus been observed in ultracool m dwarfs with both very low and high levels of quiescent emission .    assuming that these strong variations are due to flares , we estimate the flare rate from our own statistics .",
    "at least four of the fifty - three ultracool m targets were flaring the first time we observed them for this program  implying that ultracool m dwarfs spend @xmath113 of the time in a flare state .",
    "this is consistent with the observed flare rates of the `` inactive '' m9.5 dwarf bri 0021 - 0214 @xcite and the monitoring of 2m0149 @xcite .",
    "this flare rate is a lower limit , since some of our other targets may also be flaring , but lacking additional spectra we can not tell whether they are merely active as for lp 412 - 31 , and since we have no way of identifying weaker flares .",
    "the h@xmath2 equivalent widths appear to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath24 in the observed flares , implying that perhaps half of the h@xmath2 luminosity is emitted during flares .",
    "we now consider the relationship between kinematics and activity for the m8 - m9.5 dwarfs . in figure",
    "[ fig - vtanha ] , we plot the observed relation between the tangential velocity and h@xmath2 emission . there is a striking relationship between activity and velocity , in a sense opposite to that observed in more massive m dwarfs .",
    "all the dwarfs with strong h@xmath2 emission have large velocities ( @xmath114 km / s ) .",
    "there is also a striking population of low - velocity , low - activity ultracool m dwarfs . with the exception of the high - velocity , inactive m9 dwarf 2massw j0109216 + 294925",
    ", the least active stars appear to be drawn from a lower velocity population .",
    "it is difficult to fairly characterize the tangential velocity dispersion ( @xmath115 ) of these populations , but the inactive , low - velocity population in the lower left of figure  [ fig - vtanha ] may be characterized by @xmath116 km / s .",
    "while the low - velocity , low - activity population seems to to have ew@xmath117   and @xmath118 km / s , we can calculate a velocity dispersion only for a purely activity selected sample . as an illustration ,",
    "the dwarfs with @xmath119   ( excluding 2massw j0109216 + 294925 ) have @xmath120 km / s ; in contrast , those with more emission have @xmath121 km / s . using the approximation that @xmath122 , the implied total space dispersions of the two populations are 16 km / s and 47 km / s . comparing to @xcite , the active m dwarfs are apparently drawn from a @xmath123 yr population , but the inactive m dwarfs are consistent with a @xmath124 gyr population .",
    "this estimate is crude at best , but it seems clear that the overall ultracool m dwarf population is drawn from a long - lived , presumably stellar population , while the group of less active , low - velocity stars represent a younger ( @xmath125 gyr ) population .    despite the smaller sample size , the properties of l dwarfs are of considerable interest . the sample bc l0-l4 dwarf velocities are typical of an old disk population . even excluding 2m1300 due to unusual color",
    ", we find @xmath126 km / s , while including it we find @xmath127 km / s .",
    "only two of the sample bc l dwarfs show emission  the low velocity 2m1108 has the strongest emission at 7.8 , while the high velocity 2m1506 has weak 1   emission .",
    "while the velocities of only two l dwarfs are not definitive , the velocity distribution of the inactive l dwarfs suggest they are mostly old . adding the information provided by the work of k99 and k00 to our data provides strong clues , that just as in the ultracool m dwarfs , the traditional activity - age relationship is broken , perhaps even reversed .",
    "l dwarfs that show lithium absorption are necessarily younger and lower mass than l dwarfs of the same spectral type which have destroyed lithium .",
    "thus , using the traditional stellar age - activity relation , one would expect them to be more chromospherically active .",
    "consider the l1 to l4.5 dwarfs , where lithium is detectable even at the low resolution of the k99/k00 keck lris observations .",
    "only one l dwarf , kelu-1 , shows both h@xmath2 emission and lithium absorption .",
    "eleven other such l dwarfs show h@xmath2 emission but do not have lithium absorption .",
    "twelve l dwarfs show lithium absorption but do not have h@xmath2 emission ( four of these have marginal h@xmath2 detections or noise consistent with emission of less than 2 ) . while many l1-l4 dwarfs have neither h@xmath2 emission nor lithium absorption , it seems clear that the chromospherically active l dwarfs are drawn from an older , more massive population than the lithium l dwarfs . beyond l4.5 , there are no definite cases of h@xmath2 emission , although lithium absorption is present for @xmath128 of the l dwarfs .",
    "brown dwarfs have also been identified in nearby young clusters . in figure",
    "[ fig - sphabol2 ] , we compare the activity of our field dwarfs to young brown dwarfs . shown",
    "are young brown dwarfs from the @xmath73 ori cluster @xcite and the young brown in the @xmath99 oph cloud @xcite  both these clusters are less than 10 myr old . also shown are confirmed plieades brown dwarfs @xcite with age @xmath129 years . in order to suggest the age evolution of the field m dwarfs , those with @xmath130 km / s",
    "have been marked as open symbols .",
    "these low - velocity dwarfs are likely to be younger than the other field dwarfs .",
    "it is evident that the plieades m8 and later brown dwarfs are not more active that the typical field dwarfs , although the m6-m7 brown dwarfs appear to be more active .",
    "like the young field l dwarfs that have lithium aborption , the pleiades and @xmath73 ori l dwarfs do not show emission , even though some older field l dwarfs do . in the case of the @xmath99 oph brown dwarf",
    ", @xcite have shown that the emission is probably due to accretion from the circumstellar disk or envelope detected in the mid - ir .",
    "similar accretion may account for the @xmath73 ori strong emitters , while the absence of accretion would account for the weak emission in the other half of the @xmath73 ori brown dwarf sample . if the emission is chromospheric , then some other factor ( such as rotation ) is needed to explain the large spread in activity levels .",
    "it should be noted that these young brown dwarfs are probably hotter at a given spectral type @xcite , which suggests that if temperature were plotted the brown dwarfs would appear even less active compared to field dwarfs .",
    "we thus summarize the observations :    1 .",
    "although the fraction of dwarfs showing h@xmath2 emission reaches 100% at spectral type m7 , the fraction that show chromospheric activity drops rapidly for later spectral types .",
    "2 .   the fraction of energy in chromospheric h@xmath2 for those dwarfs that are active drops rapidly as a function of spectral type beyond m6 .",
    "low velocity , kinematically young m8.0-m9.5 dwarfs have weaker activity than many higher velocity , old m8.0-m9.5 dwarfs 4 .",
    "flaring is common among the m7-m9.5 dwarfs 5 .",
    "the early l ( l0-l4 ) dwarfs in sample bc have old kinematics .",
    "early l ( l1-l4.5 ) dwarfs with h@xmath2 emission are old and massive enough to have burned lithium 7 .",
    "l1-l4.5 dwarfs with lithium are unlikely to have h@xmath2 emission .",
    "none of the l dwarfs later than l4.5 have h@xmath2 emission but half have lithium .",
    "the two known l dwarfs in young clusters do not show h@xmath2 emission 10 .",
    "young pleiades m8-m9 dwarfs are less active than the higher velocity field m dwarfs .",
    "how can these observations be explained ?",
    "we believe they imply that the maximum activity level is a strong function of temperature beyond spectral type m7 , with lower temperature objects able to maintain less emission . additionally , beyond spectral type m7",
    "substellar dwarfs tend to have less activity than stellar dwarfs .    in figure  [ fig - tage ] , we plot evolutionary sequences from @xcite and @xcite . in the @xcite models",
    "the hydrogen burning limit is at 0.072 @xmath108 and the lithium burning limit is at @xmath131 .",
    "also shown is an estimated temperature scale from @xcite based on the arguments made in k99 .",
    "the models indicate that it takes @xmath132 years for stars near the hydrogen burning limit to settle into the m8 and cooler temperatures ( figure  [ fig - tage ] ) . m8 and cooler temperatures are possible at younger ages , but they are substellar objects which continue to cool with time .",
    "thus , the low velocity , low activity population is likely to be a population of substellar / transition objects . by the time they are older than 1 gyr",
    ", they appear as l dwarfs or even cooler t dwarfs .",
    "thus , the comparison of low velocity m8-m9.5 dwarfs to high velocity m8-m9.5 dwarfs is the same as a comparison of younger , lower mass ( @xmath133 ) objects to older , higher mass objects ( @xmath134 ) at the same temperature .",
    "the same occurs when comparing the k99/k00 lithium l1-l4 ( @xmath135 ) dwarfs to the k99/k00 non - lithium l1-l4 ( @xmath133 ) dwarfs .",
    "these mass estimates are only meant as illustrative values ",
    "mass estimates are subject to many uncertainties and a range of masses and ages will be sampled .",
    "both the field m8-m9 dwarf and field l dwarf observations show that at a given spectral type , the less massive dwarfs are less active , _ even though they are younger .",
    "_ it is perhaps worth noting that theoretical models suggest that the lower mass objects will be slightly more luminous with a smaller surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the comparison to cluster brown dwarfs is consistent with this trend ( figure  [ fig - sphabol2 ] ) .",
    "the plieades brown dwarfs which have cooled to these ultracool m and l temperatures are less active than old field ultracool m and l dwarfs  but more active than the low velocity ultracool m dwarfs .",
    "there are thus strong suggestions , as already noted in section  [ review ] , that activity levels do decrease with age in brown dwarfs , and that therefore activity levels are dependent upon temperature , mass , and age .",
    "the importance of accretion needs to be investigated for the youngest ( @xmath98 myr ) ages .",
    "the dominant effect is temperature , as both young and old objects show the rapid fall in activity levels beyond spectral type m7 .    at the same time",
    ", the models suggest that stars , or at least very - long lived hydrogen burning transition objects , are likely to exist down to l0 - l4 temperatures .",
    "this is completely consistent with our empirical finding that the early l dwarfs have old kinematics .",
    "we note that @xcite find a temperature of @xmath136 k for the l4 dwarf gd 165b and constrain the age to be greater than 1.2 gyr using updated models and the white dwarf primary s cooling age and argue it is just below the substellar limit , near the transition region between stars and brown dwarfs ( formally , they actually derive the minimum stellar mass using the models ) .",
    "l dwarfs with lithium must be below the lithium burning limit ( @xmath135 ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) and younger than 1 gyr ( figure  [ fig - tage ] ) .",
    "the inactivity of these lithium l dwarfs demonstrates that the lowest mass objects can not sustain significant activity at a temperature ( or luminosity ) that is adequate for sustaining some activity in older but more massive dwarfs .",
    "the decline in the frequency of activity may be associated with two effects .",
    "first , as later spectral types are considered , a larger fraction of very low mass ( substellar ) objects contribute , and these are more likely to be inactive in field samples .",
    "second , activity among the l dwarfs may die out in time , since the observed high velocity l dwarfs are inactive  although we can not tell if they were ever active .",
    "it would be of great interest to find whether or not the early k99/k00 l dwarfs which are active have low or high velocities . the high - velocity , low - activity m9.5 dwarf 2massw j0109216 + 294925 may be a young brown dwarf that happens to have high velocity , an old object which has never been active , or an old stellar m9 dwarf whose chromospheric activity has declined with age . in any case , it is worthy of additional study .",
    "we note that the high observed flare rate implies that the rotation rate may decrease with time , even among the `` inactive , rapid rotators '' if the flaring is associated with mass loss and/or a stellar wind .",
    "we speculate this may provide a mechanism for the evolution of activity .",
    "additional observations are needed to determine what the rotational velocities are as a function of mass , spectral type , and age .",
    "what fraction of the ultracool m dwarfs are likely to be substellar ?",
    "while we can not identify which individual objects are brown dwarfs , we can identify a number of probably young objects .",
    "three of our m8.0-m9.5 dwarfs show no h@xmath2 emission and very low velocity ; another three have equally low velocities and @xmath137 . out of a total population of 32 m8.0-m9.5 dwarfs ,",
    "our data suggest that @xmath138 are brown dwarfs .",
    "these objects should be more likely to have lithium absorption ( like lp 944 - 20 ) , but most of the brown dwarfs will be massive enough to burn lithium .",
    "indeed , we note that none show the distinctive signs of low surface gravity that characterize the pleiades m8 brown dwarfs teide 1 and calar 3 @xcite , so none of our targets are very young ( @xmath129 years ) .",
    "approximately ten objects belong to the low velocity , low activity group in the lower left of figure  [ fig - vtanha ]  that is a third of the sample , but some fraction of these will stabilize as hydrogen burning l dwarfs , in order to account for the observed popoulation of high velocity early l dwarfs .",
    "these fractions will be somewhat overestimated for the galactic disk population , since the old , large scale height population will be underrepresented locally .",
    "other effects may also be important , such as the fact that we have estimated distances for all dwarfs using one color - absolute magnitude relation .",
    "adding kinematic ages , as in this study , provides an additional constraint on the modelling necessary to determine the field substellar mass function @xcite .",
    "the nature of the ultracool m dwarfs has been debated for some time in the literature .",
    "while convential wisdom suggested that most if not all field ultracool m dwarfs are stellar , many suggestions that most ultracool m dwarfs are substellar have been made , most of which have been discredited .",
    "we remark that @xcite noted that the ultracool m dwarfs are expected to be a mixture of young brown dwarfs and older stars  and he also noted that there was a paucity of high proper motion ultracool m dwarfs expected from the stellar population in the lhs catalogue @xcite .",
    "our study has identified a number of high proper m dwarfs which appear on the red poss plates but were overlooked for the lhs catalogue  evidently , the faintest of these targets on the blue plate precluded their detection by luyten and contributed to the effect noted by bessell .",
    "our results show that most ultracool m dwarfs are old , and hence stellar , but perhaps 10 - 20% are a younger population of brown dwarfs .",
    "we end our discussion with a few caveats due to our photometric selection .",
    "both the relative numbers and kinematics of `` active '' and `` inactive '' m dwarfs will be changed if one group is preferentially brighter at @xmath54 for its @xmath139 color . indeed , the inactive brown dwarf lp 944 - 20 lies one magnitude below the active m dwarf lhs 2397a in the @xmath139 , @xmath54 hr diagram .",
    "preliminary usno parallaxes show instrinsic dispersion in the hr diagram for the late m and l dwarfs ( dahn , private communication ) .",
    "if inactive ultracool m dwarfs are subluminous compared to our adopted relation , we will have _ overestimated _ their velocities ; correspondingly , if the more active dwarfs are `` superluminous , '' we have underestimated their velocities .",
    "fortunately , this would only strengthen our evidence that active ultracool m dwarfs are older .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion presumably depends upon such ill - understood factors as metallicity , age , surface gravity , and dust formation .",
    "another possible bias on activity levels is that we favor the inclusion of unresolved binaries . amongst the earlier m dwarfs , very short period systems have enhanced chromospheric activity due to tidal effects maintaining high rotation rates@xcite",
    " however , even if this mechanism works in the ultracool m dwarfs , which seems unlikely if the rotation - activity relation has broken down , only @xmath140 of earlier type m dwarfs show emission due to this effect , so it should be negligible .",
    "we show that a sample of bright , nearby ultracool m and l dwarfs can be selected without proper motion bias using 2mass and pmm scans .",
    "our initial samples include high proper motion objects , visible on the poss plates , that should be added to an updated version of the lhs catalogue , and one m8.0 dwarf with a photometric parallax that places it within 10 parsecs .",
    "we intend to continue this study in order to complete the nearby star catalog for the lowest mass stars .    using our initial sample",
    ", we estimate the space density of dwarfs near the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "we show that the dropoff near the hydrogen burning limit in the five and eight parsec nearby star samples is likely to be due to incompleteness .",
    "this is more consistent with a smooth relation across the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes and searches for companions will help improve the space density estimate .",
    "most importantly , we use our spectroscopic observations of our well - defined sample to explore the relationships between age , kinematics , and chromospheric activity for the ultracool m and l dwarfs .",
    "we show that the observations can be understood if activity is primarily related to temperature and secondarily mass and age , and that lower mass ( substellar ) objects have weaker chromosperes .",
    "thus , the classical relation that strong h@xmath2 emission implies youth is not valid for these dwarfs . instead ,",
    "strong h@xmath2 emitters in the field are likely to be old ( @xmath141 gyr ) stars , while weaker emitters are often young ( @xmath142 gyr ) , lower - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "this does not exclude the idea that for a given dwarf , h@xmath2 activity declines with age  but spectral type ( temperature ) is the observable in the field . the local population of ultracool m dwarfs apparently consists both of the most massive ( lithium burning ) brown dwarfs and the lowest mass ( hydrogen burning ) stars , with the substellar objects making up a significant fraction of the sample .",
    "the early l ( l0-l4 ) dwarfs are consistent with an old , at least partially stellar population .",
    "the evidence thus suggests , as do some models , that early l dwarfs can be stable hydrogen - burning stars .",
    "expansion of the sample with follow - up observations should clarify the relative contribution of stars and brown dwarfs to these temperature ranges .",

    "<S> we have combined 2mass and poss ii data in a search for nearby ultracool ( later than m6.5 ) dwarfs with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic follow - up observations identify 53 m7 to m9.5 dwarfs and seven l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the observed space density is @xmath1 m8-m9.5 dwarfs per cubic parsec , without accounting for biases , consistent with a mass function that is smooth across the stellar / substellar limit . </S>",
    "<S> we show the observed frequency of h@xmath2 emission peaks at @xmath3 for m7 dwarfs and then decreases for cooler dwarfs . in absolute terms , however , as measured by the ratio of h@xmath2 to bolometric luminosity , none of the ultracool m dwarfs can be considered very active compared to earlier m dwarfs , and we show that the decrease that begins at spectral type m6 continues to the latest l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that flaring is common among the coolest m dwarfs and estimate the frequency of flares at 7% or higher . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the kinematics of relatively active ( @xmath4  ) ultracool m dwarfs are consistent with an ordinary old disk stellar population , while the kinematics of inactive ultracool m dwarfs are more typical of a 0.5 gyr old population . </S>",
    "<S> the early l dwarfs in the sample have kinematics consistent with old ages , suggesting that the hydrogen burning limit is near spectral types l2-l4 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the available data on m and l dwarfs to show that chromospheric activity drops with decreasing mass and temperature , and that at a given ( m8 or later ) spectral type , the younger field ( brown ) dwarfs are less active than many of the older , more massive field stellar dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , contrary to the well - known stellar age - activity relationship , low activity in field ultracool dwarfs can be an indication of comparative youth and substellar mass . </S>"
