    "his approach also misses certain nonlinear terms that are important when treating topological defects .",
    "in this section we discuss the propagation of collective modes in supersolids by examining the response to small fluctuations away from equilibrium .",
    "the number of collective hydrodynamic modes of a system can be inferred by enumerating the system s conservation laws and broken symmetries.@xcite since we are more interested in the effect of density or defect fluctuations than thermal fluctuations , for simplicity we ignore thermal fluctuations in what follows . for a three dimensional supersolid",
    "there are conservation laws for mass , three components of momentum , and energy ; however , by ignoring thermal fluctuations we can omit the energy conservation law .",
    "in addition the conservation laws , there are three broken translational symmetries ( due to the crystallinity ) and one broken gauge symmetry ( due to the bose - einstein condensation ) .",
    "thus , a three dimensional supersolid without thermal fluctuations has eight conservation laws and broken symmetries ( nine , if conservation of energy is included ) .",
    "correspondingly , there are eight hydrodynamic modes : two pairs of the ordinary transverse propagating modes , a pair of longitudinal first sound modes , and a pair of longitudinal second sound modes ( note that a solution of the hydrodynamic equations with dispersion @xmath68 would count as _ two _ modes  a pair of modes , with one propagating and a second counter - propagating ) .",
    "the appearance of the longitudinal second sound modes is one of the key signatures of a supersolid .",

    "we have dropped constants which do not contribute to the equations of motion , and have neglected terms proportional to @xmath84 because they are of higher order [ see eq .",
    "( [ sseqnrhos ] ) ] ; consequently , the quadratic lagrangian turns out to be independent of fluctuations of the superfluid density .",
    "however , we have kept the first two terms in eq .",

    "( [ quadrho1 ] ) .",
    "this would resemble the `` three - fluid '' scenario proposed by saslow @xcite in which the lattice density and velocity are introduced for the third fluid component .",

    "in addition to the five conserved densities that exist in a normal fluid there is a broken gauge symmetry , so from mode counting we conclude there are six collective modes .",
    "two of these are transverse momentum diffusion modes ( just as for the normal fluid ) , leaving _",
    "four _ longitudinal modes for the superfluid : a pair of propagating first sound modes , and a new pair of propagating second sound modes .",

    "@xcite we show below that an analogous splitting occurs in a supersolid , and should be observable in a light scattering experiment .      to facilitate the calculation of the density - density correlation function for a supersolid we ll make two simplifying assumptions : the solid is isotropic , and two dimensional .",
    "the isotropy causes the transverse and longitudinal modes to neatly decouple ; the two dimensionality results in only one pair of propagating transverse modes , rather than two pair .",
