    "wormholes are nontrivial throatlike geometrical structures which connect two parallel universes or distant parts of the same universe . in 1988 ,",
    "morris and thorne introduced a family of traversable wormholes @xcite , where the fundamental ingredient is the flaring - out condition of the wormhole throat .",
    "this latter condition , in framework of general relativity ( gr ) , entails the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) , which states that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath7 is _ any _ null vector .",
    "matter that violates the nec is denoted by",
    "_ exotic matter _ @xcite . due to the problematic issue of the violations of the energy conditions @xcite ,",
    "several avenues of research have been explored in order to minimize the usage of exotic matter @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was shown that dynamical spherically symmetric wormholes can satisfy the energy conditions @xcite and the averaged energy conditions over timelike or null geodesics for a period of time @xcite .",
    "another interesting construction are the thin - shell wormholes , where the exotic matter is restricted to the throat , and therefore minimize its usage @xcite .",
    "it was also found that higher - dimensional cosmological wormholes @xcite and wormholes in modified gravity , involving higher order curvature invariants , can satisfy the energy conditions @xcite , at least at the throat .",
    "in fact , in modified gravity , it was shown that matter threading the wormhole throat can be imposed to satisfy all of the energy conditions , and it is the higher order curvature terms , which may be interpreted as a gravitational fluid , that support these nonstandard wormhole geometries .",
    "thus , one is motivated in exploring wormhole geometries in higher - dimensional theories , due to the fact that these alleviate the violation of the energy conditions , at least at the throat .",
    "of particular interest are the @xmath8-dimensional lorentzian wormhole geometries @xcite that were explored in lovelock gravity @xcite , which is the most general theory of gravitation in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "in contrast to einstein gravity , it was found that the wormhole throat radius has a lower limit that depends on the lovelock coefficients , the dimensionality of the spacetime and the shape function .",
    "in addition to this , it was shown that the higher order lovelock terms with negative coupling constants enlarge the region of normal matter near the throat .",
    "lorentzian wormhole solutions were also investigated in the context of the @xmath9-dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet ( gb ) theory of gravitation , which is the second order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "these wormholes were found to have features depending on the dimensionality of the spacetime , @xmath8 , and the gb coupling constant , @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown that in a large number of cases , the wormhole throat radius is constrained by @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "the possibility of obtaining solutions with normal and exotic matter limited to the vicinity of the throat was also explored .",
    "similar to the situation in gr , the violation of the weak energy condition ( wec ) persists for @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , this condition may or may not be violated depending on the nature of an inequality involving @xmath12 , @xmath8 , the radius @xmath13 , and the wormhole shape function .",
    "dynamic wormhole solutions in the framework of lovelock gravity with compact extra dimensions were also analysed @xcite .",
    "it was shown that as the wormhole inflates with the three - dimensional space , the extra dimensions deflate to very small , yet nonvanishing scales .",
    "in addition to this , it was also shown that the wec holds for certain ranges of the free parameters of the theory .",
    "further higher dimensional wormhole solutions have been explored , and we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "a thorough analysis of the properties of @xmath8-dimensional static wormhole solutions was investigated in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with or without a cosmological constant .",
    "the analysis in @xcite was generalized in mae by assuming that the spacetime possessed symmetries corresponding to the isometries of an @xmath3-dimensional maximally symmetric space with the sectional curvature @xmath14 .",
    "the metric was assumed to be least @xmath15 and the @xmath3-dimensional maximally symmetric subspace to be compact .",
    "the solutions were classified into general relativistic ( gr ) and non - gr branches , respectively , depending on the existence or absence of the general relativistic limit @xmath16 .",
    "the authors showed the that branch surface in the gr branch coincides with the wormhole throat respecting the dominant energy condition ( dec ) , otherwise the nec is violated . on the other hand , in the non - gr branch for @xmath17",
    ", it was shown that there is no wormhole solution .",
    "in addition to this , it was also shown in the non - gr branch with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for the matter field with zero tangential pressure , that the dec holds at the wormhole throat if the throat radius satisfies a specific inequality .",
    "furthermore , explicit wormhole solutions respecting the energy conditions in the whole spacetime were obtained in the vacuum and dust cases with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we emphasize that despite the fact that wormhole solutions satisfying the energy conditions for the specific case of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as mentioned above , no solutions were found for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which was the case extensively explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter",
    ", the authors claimed that wormholes solutions were not possible for @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , as also mentioned in @xcite , this discussion is purely based on a nontrivial assumption , which seems to be valid only at the wormhole throat , and can not be extended throughout the entire range of the radial coordinate .",
    "although , no counterexample was provided in @xcite , here we provide for the first time a specific solution for wormholes that satisfy the wec for the specific case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to this , in all of the above gb wormhole studies , the redshift function is considered to be zero . here , we relax this assumption and consider a specific radial - dependent choice for the redshift function , which tends to zero at spatial infinity . indeed , since the gb term has low effects on regions far from throat , one can expect that a non - constant redshift function may contribute to solutions satisfying the energy conditions .",
    "thus , in this paper , we discuss higher dimensional wormhole solutions in the framework of gb gravity and investigate the effects of the gb term , with the presence of @xmath13-dependent redshift functions and considering a specific equation of state , on the satisfaction of the wec .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sol ] , we give a brief review of the field equations of gb gravity , and introduce an equation of state in order to solve the field equations . in sec .",
    "[ exact ] , several wormhole solutions are presented , more specifically , by considering particular choices for the parameters of the theory . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the action in the framework of gb theory , in the presence of a cosmological constant , is given by @xmath23 ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the dimension of the space - time ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the @xmath8-dimensional ricci scalar and the cosmological constant , respectively ; @xmath26 is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) coefficient , and the gb term @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 in lovelock theory , for each euler density of order @xmath29 in @xmath8 dimension space - time , only terms with @xmath30 exist in the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "therefore , the solutions of the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory are in @xmath31 dimensions .",
    "note that the action ( [ action ] ) is derived in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite .",
    "now , varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to metric , one obtains the field equations @xmath32where @xmath33 is the energy - momentum ( em ) tensor , @xmath34 is einstein tensor and @xmath35 is the gb tensor , given by @xmath36 we use a unit system with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath8-dimensional gravitational constant .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the @xmath8-dimensional spacetime , by replacing the two - sphere @xcite with a @xmath3-sphere , given by the following line element @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the metric on the surface of the @xmath3-sphere .",
    "@xmath41 is denoted the redshift function as it is related to the gravitational redshift ; and @xmath42 is denoted the shape function because it determines the shape of the wormhole , as can be shown by embedding diagrams @xcite .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath13 is non - monotonic in that it decreases from @xmath43 to a minimum value @xmath44 , which represents the throat of the wormhole , and then increases to @xmath43 .",
    "the shape function at the throat is defined as @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath41 should be finite everywhere in order to avoid the presence of an event horizon @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 should satisfy the flaring - out condition , i.e. , @xmath47 , so that at the throat we verify the condition @xmath48 .",
    "the condition @xmath49 is also imposed .",
    "note that although the metric coefficient @xmath50 becomes divergent at the throat , signalling a coordinate singularity , the proper radial distance @xmath51 is required to be finite everywhere .",
    "thus , the proper distance decreases from @xmath52 , in the upper universe , to @xmath53 at the throat , and then from zero to @xmath54 in the lower universe .",

    "therefore , in order to determine the wormhole geometry , one can adopt several strategies .",
    "for instance , one can apply restrictions on @xmath42 and @xmath41 or on the em tensor components .",

    "<S> in this paper , we explore higher - dimensional asymptotically flat wormhole geometries in the framework of gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity and investigate the effects of the gb term , by considering a specific radial - dependent redshift function and by imposing a particular equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> this work is motivated by previous assumptions that wormhole solutions were not possible for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 case , where @xmath2 is the sectional curvature of an @xmath3-dimensional maximally symmetric space , and @xmath4 is the gauss - bonnet coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , we emphasize that this discussion is purely based on a nontrivial assumption that is only valid at the wormhole throat , and can not be extended to the entire radial - coordinate range . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a counterexample to this claim , and find for the first time specific solutions that satisfy the weak energy condition throughout the entire spacetime , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , we also present other wormhole solutions which alleviate the violation of the wec in the vicinity of the wormhole throat . </S>"
