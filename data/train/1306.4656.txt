    "as we describe here , g54.1 + 0.3 is one such snr that provides a unique opportunity for the in - depth study of either star formation triggered by an sn progenitor or the evolution of sn dust ejecta .",
    "g54.1 + 0.3 is a young , core - collapse snr with a central pwn that is prominent in synchrotron radio and x - ray emissions . as this snr closely resembles the crab nebula , it is often referred to as a cousin of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "its central pulsar ( psr j1930 + 1852 ) , which is surrounded by a faint shell - like radio emission of @xmath08@xmath1 in diameter @xcite , has a 136-ms rotational period and a characteristic age of 2,900 yrs @xcite .",
    "there is faint x - ray emission distributed along the inner boundary of the radio shell @xcite , and together the radio and x - ray morphologies strongly suggest that the emissions are from an snr shell propagating into an ambient medium of an interstellar and/or circumstellar origin",
    ". therefore , g54.1 + 0.3 belongs to a category of composite snrs showing both a central pwn ( or plerion ) and a surrounding snr shell .",
    "notably , the recent detection of strong @xmath4-ray emission from the snr renders its pwn to be one with the highest @xmath4-ray to x - ray luminosity ratios among all known pwne driven by young rotation - powered pulsars @xcite .",
    "h  i and co observations give the kinematic distance to g54.1 + 0.3 as 510 and 68 kpc , respectively @xcite , while the dispersion measure of its central pulsar places the snr at a distance of @xmath09 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see   3.3 ) .",
    "interest in g54.1 + 0.3 has recently been sparked by the discovery of its diffuse infrared ( ir ) loop with a @xmath01@xmath1 radius @xcite .",
    "the ir loop , which was identified by observations using the _ akari _ satellite , consists of at least 11 embedded stellar objects with significant excess emission in the mid - infrared ( mir ) wavebands ; here , we refer to these as `` ir - excess stellar objects . ''",
    "their ir colors and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are consistent with those of massive ( @xmath510@xmath3 ) pre - main sequence stars with destroyed inner disks , which subsequently leads to the interpretation that their formation was triggered by a progenitor star of the sn in g54.1 + 0.3 @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "spectroscopy of the ir loop , however , implies that it is more likely made of freshly formed dust produced by the ejecta of the sn explosion and that the ir - excess stellar objects are in fact early - type main sequence ( ms ) stars of a stellar cluster to which the progenitor star originally belonged @xcite .",
    "thus , it is imperative to carry out near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopic observations of the ir - excess stellar objects to obtain more direct information for classifying the spectral types of the ir - excess stellar objects and , eventually , the origin of the ir loop .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a nir spectroscopy study of the ir - excess stellar objects and discuss the implications of the results in the context of the two possible scenarios for their origin .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   2 , we describe our observations and data reduction , followed by the spectral analyses and classifications as well as the distance determination in   3 . in   4 , we compare the results of the spectroscopic spectral classification with those from sed fit analyses and investigate the extinction distribution around the ir - excess stellar objects .",
    "we then discuss the origin of the ir - excess stellar objects in   5 and give our summary and conclusions in ",
    "nir spectroscopic observations were performed for seven of the 11 ir - excess stellar objects discovered by @xcite in the snr g54.1 + 0.3 with the triplespec spectrograph on the 5-m palomar hale telescope on 2008 august 9 .",
    "triplespec is a slit - based nir cross - dispersion echelle spectrograph covering the entire nir atmospheric window simultaneously with a spectral resolving power @xmath6 of 25003000 using six ( from 3 to 8) echelle orders mapped onto two adjacent quadrants of a hawaii ii hgcdte 2k @xmath7 2k detector array from teledyne inc . @xcite . the slit width and length of triplespec are 1  and 30 , respectively , and the broad spectral coverage of the spectrograph makes it ideal for conducting observations of new objects with little known information such as the ir - excess stellar objects in g54.1 + 0.3 .",

    "the photometric data used in @xcite are based on the _ spitzer _ irac galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) catalog , which somehow does not contain the 2mass nir magnitudes of object 6 ; these are instead obtained from the 2mass all - sky point source catalog @xcite and added in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the seven objects ( i.e. , 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , and 11 ) marked in red in figure  [ fig1 ] were observed with triplespec in this work .",
    "however , the low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of object 4 , the faintest one in the _ k_@xmath10-band , makes the reliable use of its spectrum difficult , and consequently , it has been excluded from further analysis .",
    "all the objects were observed with the typical ab nodding pattern , separated by 10@xmath11 along the slit direction , to effectively subtract the sky background emission .",
    "the total exposure time of each object was 600 s. the standard star hd 171623 ( a0v ) was observed at similar airmasses to those of the objects for standard star calibration .",
    "we first conduct flat fielding and bad pixel correction before obtaining two - dimensional wavelength solutions of the dispersed images using the oh sky emission lines . for each frame of a dithered pair ,",
    "we subtract the sky background of a given frame using the other frame and then combine the pair of sky - subtracted spectra from the two frames to produce the final spectrum .",
    "although triplespec covers wavelengths from 0.78 to 2.4  @xmath8 using six echelle orders of 38 , we only use orders 36 ( i.e. , @xmath01.02.4  @xmath8 ) due to the low s / n ratios of the spectra obtained in orders 7 and 8 .",

    "the observed spectrum of the standard source hd 171623 in figure  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) exhibits many telluric absorption lines and broad co@xmath14 absorption bands near 2.06  @xmath8 .",
    "this is divided by the model spectrum ( figure  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) to produce the spectrum in figure  [ fig2 ]  ( c ) featuring the telluric lines and system responsivity .",
    "the final calibrated spectrum ( figure  [ fig2 ]  ( e ) ) is obtained by dividing the observed spectrum ( figure  [ fig2 ]  ( d ) ) by the spectrum in figure  [ fig2 ]  ( c ) .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] present the obtained spectra of the ir - excess stellar objects after normalization by a 3rd- or 4th - order polynomial in wavelength ranges of 0.991.11 , 1.221.31 , 1.511.72 , and 2.012.25  @xmath8 , corresponding to orders 6 , 5 , 4 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "since higher orders have low throughputs for grating - based spectroscopy , the order-6 spectra have lower s / n ratios than the others .",

    "we have not identified any obvious emission lines .",
    "some emission - like features in the spectra ( e.g. , those around @xmath01.27 and @xmath01.57  @xmath8 ) are residuals of strong telluric lines that have not been completely removed during the standard star calibration .",
    "the obtained spectra ( figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) of the ir - excess stellar objects show absorption lines of strong h transitions and relatively weak he  i transitions .",
    "this , together with the lack of he  ii lines , indicates that these are stars of a late o- and early b - type between o8 and b3 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the previous interpretation based on the _",
    "jhk_@xmath15 color - color diagram and seds of these objects @xcite .",
    "also , the absence of the he  i 2.059  @xmath8 and br@xmath4 emission lines suggests that they are ms stars rather than supergiants @xcite .    to determine their spectral types more precisely , we first conduct a thorough literature search of reliable stellar spectroscopic libraries .",
    "however , as far as we are aware , only limited studies have been performed for nir spectroscopic studies of ob stars so far , and even those available studies are somewhat inadequate for spectral classification use due to their small sample sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "two additional distances of 8 kpc and 6.2@xmath24 kpc have been proposed from @xmath25co @xmath26 10 observations of nearby molecular clouds @xcite , although it is uncertain whether the clouds are indeed associated with the snr @xcite .",

    "the origin of these discrepancies in the @xmath6-band is not clear , although the slightly loose photometric calibration in the usno - b1.0 catalog and/or the conversion between the usno photographic magnitude system @xcite and the standard johnson - cousin system may be responsible .",

    "the spectral types are taken from models of @xcite ( for o - type stars ) and @xcite ( for b - type stars ) , which are mapped to the best - fit temperatures of the kurucz models .",
    "all the ir - excess stellar objects are early - type stars of similar spectral type between o9 and b2.5 , which is consistent with the previous results from their _ jhk_@xmath15 colors and also with the results from the nir spectral analyses .",

    "comparing objects 1 and 5 , however , we note that the former has stronger h absorption lines , which would indicate a lower temperature ( figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) , even though it has a higher sed temperature ( figure  [ fig8 ] and table  [ tbl4 ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that object 1 is a binary system of two early - type stars , similar to object 2 .",
    "the dotted line of object 1 in figure  [ fig8 ] shows such an example where we calculate the expected sed of a binary system comprising two early - type stars of @xmath27 = 24,000  k.    table  [ tbl4 ] also contains the extinctions of the ir - excess stellar objects , where the six objects ( 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , and 11 ) with the obtained nir spectra show almost identical extinctions to those in table  [ tbl3 ] . the extinctions of all the ir - excess stellar objects are between @xmath20 = 7 and @xmath20 = 11 mag , and objects 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 9 , which have extinctions of @xmath28 mag , appear to be located in the western part of the ir loop ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with their relative faintness as listed in table  [ tbl1 ] and their non - detection in the _ b_-band , which is the most sensitive to increased extinctions .",
    "the increased extinctions indicate a potential enhancement of matter in the western part of the ir loop , and the relatively smaller ( @xmath297 mag ) extinctions of the objects in the outer part of the loop , i.e. , objects 8 , 10 , and 11 , support this interpretation .",
    "@xcite previously estimated the average x - ray absorption column density toward the central pulsar in g54.1 + 0.3 to be @xmath30 @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 mag ) , whereas in the deeper x - ray observations of @xcite , a spatial variation in the absorption column density with a mean value of @xmath33 @xmath31 ( or @xmath34 mag ) was found .",
    "the extinction values estimated from the x - ray observations are somewhat larger than those of the ir - excess stellar objects from the sed fits in this study , which suggests the possibility of a much wider dust distribution than the observed ir loop , e.g. , a shell - like distribution surrounding the x - ray pwn of g54.1 + 0.3 that is invisible due to the absence of heating sources .",
    "two possible scenarios that explain the relation between the ir - excess stellar objects and the snr g54.1 + 0.3 have been proposed : ( 1 ) @xcite proposed that the ir - excess stellar objects are massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) whose formation was triggered by the progenitor of g54.1 + 0.3 based on their seds and spatial confinement to the ir loop ; and ( 2 ) @xcite , using the results obtained with _ spitzer _ irs observations , proposed that the ir - excess stellar objects are members of a stellar cluster to which the progenitor of the snr originally belonged and that the ir emission is from the ejecta dust heated by the stellar objects .",
    "we discuss these two scenarios in the context of the results presented in this paper .      in the first scenario ,",
    "the ir - excess stellar objects are interpreted to be massive ysos whose formation was triggered by the progenitor of the snr g54.1 + 0.3 @xcite . as @xcite has previously shown , the seds of the ir - excess stellar objects have a dip at around 8  @xmath8 with a strong mir excess , similar to those of stars without substantial circumstellar material such as ysos with a truncated disk or herbig ae / be stars with a breakup inner disk @xcite .",
    "however , the nir spectra ( figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) of the ir - excess stellar objects do not show any emission lines that are often found in herbig ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the ir - excess stellar objects are in a relatively later evolutionary stage of pre - ms stars with only little nearby circumstellar material remaining .",
    "in general , the disk lifetime of ysos is well correlated with the mass of the central star , and for stars more massive than 7@xmath3 , it is known that disk dispersion takes less than 1 myr @xcite . hence , the ir - excess stellar objects are likely to be a few million years old , and their formation may have been triggered during the late ms or post - ms evolutionary stages of the progenitor . in the case of the later , a potential delay in the triggered formation process due to local environment effects has been proposed @xcite .    the ir loop in g54.1 + 0.3 , where the ir - excess stellar objects are embedded , was suggested to be composed of fast - expanding sn ejecta dust @xcite , although this does not preclude the existence of the local ism and/or circumstellar material in the loop .",
    "if the ejecta dust is illuminated by the ir - excess stellar objects , then significant enhancement of the mir emission can occur , and depending on the distance between the two , the 8  @xmath8 dip features seen in the seds of the latter ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) may arise . if the ir emission of the stellar objects is from sn dust rather than circumstellar dust , then the ir - excess stellar objects would be older than a few million years , and subsequently , the triggered formation by the progenitor star of g54.1 + 0.3 could have happened earlier , e.g. , during their ms stages .",
    "on the other hand , we note that confirmation of the ir - excess stellar objects as a result of triggered star formation is somewhat uncertain based on the available information from the existing observations .",
    "as described above , the spatial confinement of the ir - excess stellar objects in the ir loop surrounding the pwn in g54.1 + 0.3 indicates potential triggered star formation by the sn progenitor star .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations of the feedback effects on star formation @xcite suggest that the features such as bubble walls or pillars , in which young stars are embedded , do not always trace triggered star formation , although they may serve as a good indicator . according to the results , such geometrical distributions of stars can be produced without feedback , depending on environments @xcite .      according to the second scenario ,",
    "an sn exploded as a member of a cluster of stars that includes the ir - excess stellar objects , and the stellar cluster illuminates the sn ejecta dust to produce the strong mir emission that is observed @xcite . in this case , the results of the nir spectroscopy reported in this paper help constrain the mass and type of the sn progenitor as follows .",
    "first , the mass ( @xmath35 ) of an o9 star , which is the earliest spectral type of the ir - excess stellar objects ( table  [ tbl4 ] ) , gives the lower limit of the progenitor mass , and considering the continuous distribution of the initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the progenitor mass can not be much greater than that of an o9 star .",
    "in other words , it is unlikely that the progenitor was massive enough to be a wolf - rayet star of @xmath535@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "consequently , we can constrain the progenitor mass to be in the range of 1835@xmath3 , although the upper limit may be significantly lower than 35@xmath3 .    the sn type of g54.1 + 0.3 has not yet been definitively confirmed .",
    "@xcite previously ruled out the iil / b possibility due to a lack of any observational evidence indicating the existence of strong circumstellar interactions and suggested that g54.1 + 0.3 is an sn iip or ib / c . if the progenitor star was a single star , then we believe that it is less likely to be an sn ib / c , given the upper mass limit , which leaves us only with the iip possibility .",
    "the mass range of sn iip progenitors was first calculated to be 925@xmath3 by @xcite based only on single star evolutionary models .",
    "@xcite , however , recently suggested a smaller range of 818@xmath3 after observationally accounting for contributions from both single stars and binaries in the entire core - collapse populations .",
    "this range of @xcite for the progenitor mass of sne iip places the g54.1 + 0.3 progenitor mass close to the upper limit , similar to that of the o9 star , which is the earliest existing member of the cluster as noted .",
    "therefore , if the progenitor of g54.1 + 0.3 was indeed a member of the cluster to which the ir - excess stellar objects also belong and exploded as an sn iip , the spectral type of the progenitor should be that of a late o - type star ( e.g. , o8 ) .",
    "finally , we note that in principle we can not yet completely rule out the possibility of the g54.1 + 0.3 progenitor being a binary that exploded as an sn ib / c , although we believe that this possibility is low since sne ib / c from binaries are much less abundant than sne iip .",
    "we present the results of broadband nir spectroscopic observations and sed analyses of the ir - excess stellar objects discovered in the ir loop of the snr g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "a summary of our results and main conclusions are below .",
    "\\(1 ) we spectroscopically determine the spectral types of the six ir - excess stellar objects to be between o9 and b2 based on the empirical relation ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn1 ] ) between the _ ew_s of the h lines and stellar temperatures that we establish using the results of previous studies available in the literature .",
    "the determined spectral types are consistent with those from the _",
    "jhk_@xmath15 color analyses .",
    "the established relation between the _ ew_s of the h lines and stellar temperatures can generally be used to determine the spectral types of ob stars with nir spectra , and it is worthwhile to refine the relation in the future by increasing the sample size .",
    "\\(2 ) we determine the distance , which is independent of the galactic rotation model , to the ir - excess stellar objects to be 6.0 @xmath2 0.4 kpc based on our sed fits .",
    "the distance of 6 kpc is somewhat smaller than but still compatible to the previously proposed distances to g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "\\(3 ) the photometric spectral types of most of the ir - excess stellar objects lie within the range of o9b2.5 , which is consistent with the spectroscopic results .",
    "the extinctions of the ir - excess stellar objects , with a mean of @xmath20 = 7.9 @xmath2 0.1 mag , increase in the western part of the ir loop , indicating an enhancement of matter in that region .",
    "\\(4 ) if the formation of the ir - excess stellar objects was triggered by the progenitor star of g54.1 + 0.3 , then the lack of emission lines in our nir spectra indicates that the objects are likely to be a few million years old , which is suggestive of triggering occurring during the late ms or post - ms stages of the progenitor .",
    "however , the potential contributions of the sn ejecta dust to the observed mir emission of the ir - excess stellar objects may also be consistent with triggering during the ms stages .",
    "\\(5 ) if the ir - excess stellar objects are members of a stellar cluster to which the progenitor originally belonged , then our nir spectroscopic results constrain the mass of the progenitor to be slightly greater than 17@xmath3 .",
    "in such a case , it is more likely that g54.1 + 0.3 was an sn iip .",
    "the nir spectroscopic observations of the ir - excess stellar objects in the snr g54.1 + 0.3 presented in this study provide important information about their nature , particularly the spectral types . however , their origin and relation with the snr are still unclear .",
    "further investigations on the dust in the ir loop and the progenitor of g54.1 + 0.3 , accompanied by the use of physical models , will help decipher the nature of the ir - excess stellar objects and substantiate a more plausible scenario of their origin .",
