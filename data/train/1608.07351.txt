    "the cold dusty gas around active galactic nuclei ( agn ) obscures and reprocesses the intrinsic radiation of agn and is the key ingredient of understanding different types of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the obscuring gas emits fluorescent lines when irradiated by the central agn .",
    "the most prominent one is the fe @xmath0line at 6.4 kev , which is found to be ubiquitous in all types of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the fluorescent fe @xmath0line can be used to probe the properties of the obscuring gas .",
    "for example , the stability of the fe @xmath0line of most agn indicates that the obscuring gas should be outside the broad line region ( blr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the exact emitting region of the fluorescent line can be inferred from the intrinsic width of the fe @xmath0line ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "the measurement of the intrinsic line width , however , is limited by the spectral resolution of currently available instruments .",
    "the first order data of high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide a spectral resolution of 0.012    ( full width half maximum , fwhm ) with its high energy grating ( heg ) , which at 6.4 kev corresponds to @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 , very close to the measured mean fwhm of the fe @xmath0line ( 2000 km  s@xmath3 ) by @xcite .    because the heg spectral resolution is higher at lower energies",
    ", the measurement of the line width can be improved by using other low - energy fluorescent lines . in a recent paper @xcite , we measured the fwhm of the si @xmath0line ( at 1.74 kev ) for circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , which are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 km  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these values are @xmath1 times smaller than those measured from the fe @xmath0line previously , and the estimated line - emitting regions are outside the dust sublimation radii of these agn .",
    "it indicates that the intrinsic widths of the fe @xmath0line are likely to be over - estimated . nevertheless ,",
    "because the si @xmath0line is much more sensitive to absorption than the fe @xmath0line , the si @xmath0line may not come from the same physical region as the fe @xmath0line .",
    "this makes the estimation of the emitting region of the fe @xmath0line still uncertain .    in principle , the uncertainty of the fe @xmath0emitting region can be solved by spectroscopic observations with resolution higher than the first order heg data .",
    "we noted that the second and third order heg data have a resolution approximately 2 and 3 times better than the first order data , but with a less effective area @xcite .",
    "we checked the second and third order heg data of circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , and found that indeed , the higher order heg data provide more stringent constraints on the intrinsic widths of the fe @xmath0line than the first order data . in this letter we present these measurements .",
    "besides circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , we also include ngc 3783 , ngc 4151 , ngc 4388 , and ngc 4151 , the higher order heg data of which are deep enough to provide a meaningful measurement of the intrinsic width of the fe @xmath0line .",

    "because the heg effective areas of the second and third order are about 15 times less than that of the first order @xcite , only for nearby bright sources with deep exposures , the higher order heg data can be used to measure the intrinsic width of the fe @xmath0line .",
    "we searched transmission grating data archive and catalog ( tgcat , * ? ? ? * ) , and found that besides circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , the second and third order heg data of ngc 3783 , ngc 4151 , ngc 4388 , and ngc 4151 are also usable . among them , ngc 3783 and ngc 4151 are classified as type 1.5 agn , while the others are type 2 agn .",

    ", it is still uncertain whether the line widths of the fe @xmath0line are over - estimated or not .    in this letter we measured the line width of the fe @xmath0line using the second and third order heg spectra of several nearby bright agn . for circinus , ngc 4151 , and ngc 3783 , which have deep enough signals ,",

    "the results clearly show that the line widths of the fe @xmath0line measured from the first order heg spectra are over - estimated .    in principle , the first order and higher order heg data should provide consistent results on the line widths .",
    "however , when the intrinsic line width is too narrow to be resolved by the first order data , we do not expect the same results , since there are observational noises and the instrument responses are not ideal . to validate our measurements",
    ", we simulated 100 heg observations of the fe @xmath0line using marx @xcite for the two gaussian model of circinus with an intrinsic width of 5 ev ( corresponding to the velocity of that measured from the si @xmath0line width ) , and the exposure time is set to be the same as that of the real observations .",
    "we note that marx is used to generate the heg rmf calibration products , and contains all known effects about the instrumental line profile ( d. huenemoerder , private communication ) .",
    "we then fitted the simulated heg spectra with the same two gaussian model .",
    "we found that 90% of the fitted fe @xmath0widths from the first order spectra are within @xmath14 ev . on the other hand , 90% of the fitted widths from the second and third order spectra are within @xmath15 ev . considering that the first order spectra are contaminated by the compton shoulder , which is less important for the higher order spectra of better resolution , the simulation results are fully consistent with our measured results .",
    "we note that except for circinus , ngc 4151 , and ngc 3783 , the fe @xmath0lines of all the other sources are not well resolved , and the measurements presented here are only upper limits of the true widths .",
    "deeper data with similar or higher spectral resolution are needed to obtain the true widths .    for the current measurements , the fwhm velocities of the fe",
    "@xmath0line are around 1000 km / s , similar to those of narrow emission lines . if assuming a virialized orbit , the fe @xmath0line - emitting regions are close to the dust sublimation radii , as inferred from the widths of si @xmath0line in @xcite .",
