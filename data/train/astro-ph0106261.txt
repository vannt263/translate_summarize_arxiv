    "the selected sample has been extracted from the leda database .",
    "it consists of 584 galaxies within a radius of 8 degrees ( 2.25  mpc at 16  mpc ) from m  87 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and known recession velocities smaller than 3000 km / s .",
    "unfortunately , not all these galaxies have distance estimates , and we therefore reduced the working sample to 125 late - type and 67 early - type galaxies , with distance measurements from g99 , e00 , f98 and t01 .",
    "let us describe in more detail some of the observable parameters collected for these galaxies .",
    "these parameters are directly extracted from the leda database .",
    "coordinates are given in the j2000.0 equinox , and helocientric velocities are corrected to the local group centroid using the yahil et al .",
    "( @xcite ) formula .",
    "a histogram of the corrected velocities for the full sample of 584 galaxies is presented in fig .",
    "[ histov ] .",
    "it clearly shows more galaxies on the high - velocity side than expected from a gaussian distribution .",
    "a similar but smaller effect also seems apparent on the low - velocity side . for galaxies with distance measurements ,",
    "the same features appear .      an accurate estimate of morphological types is important at least for two reasons : the hi deficiency parameter ( see below ) is calculated by comparing the hi content of a galaxy to the average hi content of an isolated galaxy of the same morphological type .",
    "any error in the type therefore translates into a corresponding error in the hi deficiency estimate .",
    "similarly , distances determined by e00 use the calibration of theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , where the intercept of the tully - fisher relation varies with the type .",
    "any error in the type changes the galaxy distance value accordingly .",
    "we used three sources of morphological type determinations : de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter rc3 ) , the vcc catalogue and van den bergh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the quality of rc3 types depends upon its source , coded according to table  3 of vol .  1 of the catalogue .",
    "if the morphological type has been measured on large reflector plates ( code r ) , it is adopted ; if it comes from pss prints ( codes p or u ) , we adopt an eye average with the two other sources .",
    "the adopted morphological types differ therefore from those given in leda and used by e00 .",
    "we adopted a numeric morphological type according to the rc3 coding scheme . for distance measurements",
    ", we decided to restrict application of the fundamental plane and sbf methods to types between -5 and -1 ( e to l+ ) and of the tully - fisher method to types between 1 and 9 ( sa to sm ) .",
    "therefore , 7 galaxies were excluded from the late - type sample ( types -1 , 0 and 10 ) , and 2 galaxies were excluded from the early - type sample ( ngc  4440 and ngc  4531 , both of type 1 ) .",
    "the final sample thus contains 118 spiral , 43 lenticular and 22 elliptical galaxies .        for early - type galaxies",
    ", we have used the g99 compilation of distances , obtained from the fundamental plane method in @xmath4-band . according to these authors",
    ", their accuracy should be about 21% .",
    "these distances are based on an assumed virgo distance of 16  mpc . to this compilation of 55 elliptical and lenticular galaxies , we added sbf distances from t01 .",
    "it contains 35 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster area , of which 25 are common with g99 .",
    "tonry s distances are calibrated independently of any assumed virgo distance , and the mean shift compared to g99 amounts to :    @xmath7    after rejection of ngc  4638 ( @xmath8 mpc and @xmath9 mpc ) . as the mean difference of the two systems is not significant , we adopt an unweighted average of the two measurements as our distance measurement for this set of 25 early - type galaxies , and the uncorrected only available distance for the 40 other galaxies ( 30 from g99 , 10 from tonry ) .",
    "please note that both references include more uncertain measurements : in g99 , they are identified as being due to velocity dispersions smaller than 100  km  s@xmath10 ; in t01 , they appear in a separate table , named `` table.poor '' .",
    "we have kept these galaxies in our sample , but we generally exclude them from our statistical calculations .      for late - type galaxies , we also started from the g99 compilation ( 59 galaxies retained ) , obtained from the @xmath4-band tully - fisher method , with a claimed accuracy of about 16% .",
    "we complemented this list with galaxies with @xmath3-band tully - fisher distances from e00 ( 41 ) and f98 ( 109 ) .",
    "we do not use galaxies from these lists outside of 8 degrees from m  87 or with morphological types outside of our adopted range ( 1 - 9 ) .    to convert e00 distances into the g99 system ,",
    "two corrections are done : first , we correct the distances to our adopted morphological type , in the 20 cases where it differs from the leda type adopted in e00 . indeed , the intercept @xmath11 of the @xmath3-band tully - fisher relation derived by theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and adopted in e00 depends upon the morphological type .",
    "the correction is given by :    @xmath12    although the morphological type differences never exceed one unit , the correction can amount to 25% in distance .",
    "additionally , e00 distances are based on the theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calibration , which leads to @xmath13 ; as e00 adopt a cosmic velocity of virgo of @xmath14 , this implies a virgo distance of 21.8  mpc",
    ". therefore , the conversion factor to the g99 assumed virgo distance of 16  mpc is :    @xmath15    to convert f98 distances into the g99 system , we simply apply the calibration correction derived from different adopted virgo distances , namely 21.5 mpc and 16 mpc :    @xmath16    as we have 65 galaxies with more than one distance estimate , we can make an intercomparison among the three sources of distance data , after their reduction to the mean system .",
    "we find :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the mean value of available distance measurements for a given galaxy .",
    "all these shifts are significant .",
    "this means that our first guess of the conversion factors to the g99 system was not as successful as we could hope .",
    "we therefore repeated it with new conversion factors , until we reach on average negligible shifts of the corrected systems to the mean one .",
    "this leads to the following adopted conversion factors , after rejection of two galaxies with discrepant distance measurements ( ngc  4180 and ngc  4591 ) :    @xmath19    we adopt these new conversion factors to put all three references into the same system .",
    "then , considering that the advantages of the @xmath4-band ( low extinction correction ) are compensated by the smaller slope of the tully - fisher relation in @xmath3-band , we do not weigh each measurement and adopt a straight average of the available distance estimates for each galaxy .",
    "we will only use these mean distances to classify the galaxies among the various classes described in sect .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ histod ] a histogram of these 118 average distances .",
    "the mean value of 20  mpc and the skewness of the histogram clearly show the background contamination of our sample . by comparison",
    ", the histogram of distances for early - type galaxies appears to be less contaminated by background galaxies ( smaller mean distance and smaller skewness ) .",
    "as we are concerned with the distance determination of individual galaxies in the virgo cluster , we quantify hi deficiency by means of a distance - independent parameter def , based on the difference between the expected and observed logarithm of the mean ( hybrid ) hi surface density , @xmath20 , that is    @xmath21    with @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 represents the corrected hi flux density integrated over the profile width in units of @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents the apparent optical diameter in arcmin . for non - detections ,",
    "an upper limit to hi content is estimated by assuming that the emission profile is rectangular with an amplitude 1.5 times the rms noise and width equal to that expected for a galaxy of the same morphological type and luminosity , properly corrected for redshift broadening and viewing inclination ( solanes et al .",
    "@xcite ; see also haynes & giovanelli @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted standard values of @xmath26 per type are : 0.24 for sa , sab ; 0.38 for sb ; 0.40 for sbc ; 0.34 for sc ; and 0.42 for later spiral types .    among our sample of 118 spiral galaxies",
    ", we have hi deficiency estimates for 106 galaxies , or 90% of the sample .",
    "it has been suggested that tully - fisher distances may be underestimated for highly hi deficient galaxies ( t92 ; fukugita et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason",
    ", we have investigated possible differences in the rotation velocities of hi deficient and hi normal galaxies in the 12 hi deficient clusters identified by solanes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , as well as the influence of the hi content on the tully - fisher relationship of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the results obtained allow us to conclude that hi deficiency does not affect our tully - fisher distances .",
    "we use the tolman - bondi model of the virgo cluster as defined in e99 .",
    "let us recall that the tolman - bondi model gives an analytical solution to einstein s field equations for a spherically symmetric pressure - free density excess , embedded in an otherwise homogeneous universe .",
    "the parameters of the model are : the observed virgo cluster velocity in the local group reference frame ( @xmath27 ) , the virgocentric infall velocity of the local group ( @xmath28 ) , the virgocentric density profile slope ( @xmath29 ) , and the deceleration parameter of the background homogeneous universe , taken as an einstein - de sitter universe for simplicity ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "although there is a general agreement about the values of 3 of these parameters , the virgocentric density profile slope is not well known , as it should reflect the distribution of the mass around the cluster center , not only the galaxy ( light ) distribution . in e99 , it has been constrained using 32 galaxies whose distances were known using their cepheids , generally measured with the hst , through the pl - relation . for details about the model , the adjustment of its parameters and the influence of changing these values , the reader is referred to t92 , e99 and e00 .    for each galaxy ,",
    "the angular distance to the virgo center of mass ( taken to be the position of m  87 ) completely defines the exact shape of the tolman - bondi s - curve in the velocity distance diagram , for a given choice of model parameters .",
    "then , the observed recession velocity of the galaxy ( in the local group reference frame ) gives one to three possible distance ratios of the galaxy to virgo ( see fig .",
    "[ ngc ] for examples ) .",
    "the first and the third values correspond to a galaxy falling into the cluster from in front or behind .",
    "the second value corresponds to a true cluster member . assuming that the tolman - bondi model can explain most of the observed positions of the galaxies in the velocity - distance diagram means that we neglect other possible components , such as an expanding one suggested by t92 , or galaxies projected by chance onto the cluster , but taking part in the hubble flow .",
    "certainly , not all galaxies in the virgo cluster should follow the tolman - bondi model .",
    "for instance , galaxies belonging to the virialized core of the cluster do not exhibit a velocity - distance relation .",
    "it is however difficult to disentangle those galaxies from our class 2 , so that we include them into it . on the other hand ,",
    "not all galaxies in the class 2 ( defined as the descending branch of the s - shape tolman - bondi curve ) belong to virgo : for instance , at large angular distances from m  87 the descending branch still exists , but is no longer related to proper virgo galaxies .",
    "we assume that within 8 degrees of the cluster center , most of the galaxies on the descending branch are true cluster members .",
    "we will test this strong assumption in sect .  6 by building a histogram of `` virgo distances '' , where each point is computed from a galaxy distance and its distance ratio to virgo , as given by the tolman - bondi model .    to do this , we must select the most plausible one among the possible distance ratios for a given galaxy , when the model gives more than one value . here , we made use of two criteria : we try to choose the value closest to the assumed virgo distance ( 16  mpc ) , and , for spiral galaxies , we take into account the hi deficiency , assuming that a true member of the cluster has a higher probability to be deficient than a galaxy falling for the first time into the cluster .",
    "we therefore attribute to each galaxy a `` class number '' , which is 1 if we adopt the first value of the distance ratio to virgo ( galaxies falling from in front into the cluster ) , 2 if we adopt the second value ( true cluster members ) , and 3 if we adopt the third value ( galaxies falling from behind into the cluster ) .",
    "there are 6 galaxies in or close to the virgo cluster whose distance is known thanks to the hst observations in @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , using the cepheid period - luminosity relation .",
    "we use the distances published in freedman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( without the uncertain metallicity correction ) .",
    "five of the six distances cluster about a mean distance of 14.6  mpc , while the sixth one ( ngc  4639 ) gives a larger distance ( 21  mpc ) .",
    "this is perfectly explained by the tolman - bondi model , and this was in fact the initial motivation of this study .",
    "figure  [ ngc ] gives the result of the application of the tolman - bondi model to these galaxies , with a dotted line showing the recession velocity of the galaxy , and an arrow showing the distance ratio to virgo , for an adopted distance to virgo of 15.4  mpc ( see below ) .",
    "two galaxies belong to the virgo southern extension ( ngc  4496a and ngc  4536 ) and lie at more than 8 degrees from m  87 .",
    "however , their position in the velocity - distance diagram should be explained by our model , if we assume that no other cluster perturbes them .",
    "however , we find that the maximum velocity explained by our model for ngc  4536 is @xmath33 at @xmath34 , too small compared to its observed velocity of @xmath35 . for this galaxy ,",
    "our model predicts it to be in the class 3 , with a distance of @xmath36 .",
    "this in turn would lead to an inacceptable virgo distance of @xmath37 , using the observed galaxy distance of 14.45  mpc .",
    "in fact , it is well known that random velocities about 80 @xmath38 exist for all galaxies and explain the velocity dispersion of small groups of galaxies ( gourgoulhon et al .",
    "we therefore assume that this is the origin of the small discrepancy observed for ngc  4536 .",
    "table  [ cephgal ] gives the adopted distances to the six galaxies , the model predicted distance ratios to the virgo distance for the three possible solutions , the corresponding predicted `` virgo distances '' , the adopted class , and the adopted virgo distance for each galaxy .",
    "now we discuss each galaxy in some detail : for ngc  4548 , only the second and third distances are plausible ; but the large hi deficiency leads us to attribute this galaxy to class 2 as a true member of the virgo cluster .",
    "similarly , the large hi deficiency of ngc  4321 makes us attribute it to class 2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the insignificant deficiency of ngc  4639 leads to put it into class 3 , with a derived virgo distance intermediate between ngc  4321 and ngc  4548 .",
    "for ngc  4535 , the hi deficiency is low , but putting it into class 1 would lead to a larger derived virgo distance than the previous galaxies , so we attribute it to class 2 .",
    "ngc  4496a belongs to the virgo southern extension and is not hi deficient ; it is therefore tempting to put it into class 1 , but again putting it into class 2 leads to a derived virgo distance in better agreement with the remaining galaxies .",
    "finally , ngc  4536 also belongs to the virgo southern extension and has a small hi deficiency , and it may be put into class 1 or 2 , once its recession velocity is corrected for a random component . the resulting mean value of the six derived virgo distances is @xmath39 , which we adopt as our estimate of the cluster distance .    at the referee s request ,",
    "we have investigated what happens if a virgo distance of 21.5  mpc is preferred from independent arguments .",
    "then , four of the five galaxies classified in class 2 now fall into class 1 ( infalling galaxies ) , ngc  4639 is the only true member of the virgo cluster among the six , and ngc  4548 position can not be explained by the model .",
    "the high hi deficiency of ngc  4321 is contradictory .",
    "this alternative distance is clearly less probable according to these six galaxies with cepheid distances .",

    "disentangling the different components of the virgo cluster is difficult and somewhat subjective .",
    "however , the use of the tolman - bondi model allows us to classify each galaxy into one of the three classes defined previously .",
    "we did that independently for early - type and spiral galaxies . in each case , we have built several diagrams : the first one is the histogram of the `` virgo derived distances '' , and it is shown in fig .  [ hisdc ] .",

    "we have not convincingly identified any spiral galaxy belonging to class 1 ; the only two early - type objects classified in class 1 exhibit low velocities ( about 800 km s@xmath10 ) , which is difficult to interpret ; in fact , these two galaxies may be genuine members of the cluster ( class 2 ) with bad distance measurements ; indeed , both galaxies have a velocity dispersion smaller than 100 km s@xmath10 , which makes their fundamental plane distances quite uncertain .",

    "if we divide the sample of 51 virgo galaxies equally into large and small @xmath93 , we get mean distances of :    @xmath97    it can therefore safely be concluded that the incompleteness bias does not affect significantly our sample of true virgo members ( it would lead to a smaller mean distance for galaxies with small rotation velocities , which are more biased ) .",
    "it can still be argued that the bias may be hidden , because the slope of the tully - fisher relation , when determined from the virgo cluster sample , may be biased due to a possible incompleteness of the sample at small @xmath93 .",
    "this is however not observed , as the direct slope determined from the calibrators is @xmath98 , while an incompleteness bias would predict a steeper slope as compared to the slope determined from the virgo sample ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the 0.3 mag difference between the cepheid and tully - fisher distances is worrying .",
    "tenants of the long distance scale will see evidence that the tully - fisher distance is the correct one , while most galaxies with cepheid distances are infalling on the front side of the cluster .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated how the relativistic tolman - bondi model as applied in e99 gives constraints on the virgo cluster mass and distance , and allows one to disentangle its quite intricate structure .",
    "distances to 183 virgo galaxies from 5 references have been used and averaged , together with hi deficiency parameters for spirals , to classify the galaxies into 4 different distance classes : an infalling component in front of virgo , the virgo cluster itself , an infalling component behind the main cluster , and background groups .",
    "the main results of the present study are :    * among the 6 galaxies in the virgo area with cepheid distance measures , ngc  4639 is well - known to be discrepant .",
    "our model nicely explains this apparent discrepancy , and the resulting mean distance to virgo using all 6 calibrators is @xmath0 mpc .",
    "however , the mean tully - fisher distance derived from 51 spiral galaxies classified as true members of the cluster in the present study , and calibrated using the same cepheid distance system ( freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) is larger ( @xmath1 mpc ) . *",
    "the mass of the virgo cluster derived from our model is large : @xmath2 , which corresponds to 1.7 virial mass .",
    "our adopted mass profile is steeper than the light distribution ( anti - biasing ) . *",
    "apart from the well - known background groups which once contaminated virgo samples , we have identified a number of galaxies at intermediate distances between these groups and the cluster itself , which we interpret as filaments extracted from the background groups and falling into the cluster from behind .",
    "* we have not been able to securely identify galaxies in front of the cluster and falling into it .",
    "this supports sandage & tammann ( @xcite ) who always argued that apparently foreground galaxies in the virgo cluster direction were in fact cluster members .",
    "* distances to the virgo cluster adopted by f98 and e00 differ from what would be expected using the distances predicted by our model and the mean ratio of published to predicted distances .",
    "they also differ from the mean of the published distances restricted to the true virgo members .",
    "we also note that the distances published in e00 are highly dispersed , even for true virgo members .",
