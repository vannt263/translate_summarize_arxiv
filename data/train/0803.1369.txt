    "since the seminal paper by gross and neveu in 1974 @xcite , field theoretic models of fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions with ( broken or unbroken ) chiral symmetry have turned out to be quite useful . in view of a long list of applications in particle , condensed matter and mathematical physics , it is surprising that after more than three decades the basic solution of these models is still incomplete , even in the tractable limit of an infinite number of flavors @xmath0 .",
    "a few years ago it has been realized that the alleged phase diagram of gross - neveu ( gn ) models in the temperature ( @xmath1 ) versus chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) plane @xcite was inconsistent with the known baryon spectrum . in the standard gn model with scalar - scalar interaction ,",
    "this problem has been solved in the meantime with the construction of a soliton crystal phase ( see @xcite and references therein ) built out of dashen - hasslacher - neveu baryons @xcite .",

    "@xcite the sine - gordon equation was subsequently identified as the first term of a systematic chiral expansion and higher order corrections were determined with the help of derivative expansion techniques . in the present work ,",
    "we try to further improve this situation by constructing baryons in the ( large @xmath0 ) njl@xmath3 model for arbitrary bare fermion mass , using a combination of analytical and numerical methods .",

    "let us use these results to exhibit some differences between baryons in massive gn and njl@xmath3 models , respectively .",

    "another pertinent observation is the following . in the gn model ,",
    "the scalar potential @xmath39 is reflectionless for any static solution @xcite .",
    "this has turned out to be instrumental for the exact , analytical solvability of the baryon problem .",
    "we can now easily check whether the same is true for the njl@xmath3 model , at least in the region of validity of the derivative expansion .    by solving the dirac scattering problem with potential ( [ b4 ] )",

    "the transmission coefficient rises from 0 at low energies to 1 at high energies .",
    "similar results are obtained at other values of @xmath15 .",
    "this is at variance with claims in the literature @xcite ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) and already indicates that the baryon problem in the njl@xmath3 model is more challenging than in the gn model .",
    "recently , an approximation has been devised which yields analytical insight into the regime where the baryon features one positive energy valence level , while still having smooth hf potentials .",
    "the idea is to integrate out the negative energy fermions ( i.e. , the dirac sea ) and derive an effective theory for the ( positive energy ) valence fermions only .",
    "the hf equation for the baryon then reduces to a single non - linear ( and in general non - local ) dirac equation .",
    "this is a tremendous simplification as compared to the full relativistic hf problem , although somewhat more involved than the derivative expansion of sec .  [ sect2 ] , where the fermions have been integrated out altogether . for the derivation of the effective lagrangian in the massive njl@xmath3 model",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the solution of the non - linear dirac equation and the determination of the parameter region where the proposed truncation is valid .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the effective no - sea lagrangian consists of a massive free dirac part and interaction terms descending from the original scalar and pseudoscalar four - fermion interactions .",
    "as far as terms involving only scalar interactions are concerned , we keep all contributions in eq .",
    "( 39 ) of ref .",
    "the terms involving pseudoscalar interactions require one additional approximation .",
    "starting point is the result for the massive njl@xmath3 model , eq .",
    "( 76 ) of @xcite , replacing the scalar effective coupling constant @xmath40 by the corresponding expression in the massive model ( cf .",
    "( 72 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "if we insist on an analytical solution as we do in this section , we are only able to handle the case in which the non - locality due to one - pion exchange is of short range .",
    "we therefore assume that the mass term @xmath41 dominates the inverse pion propagator and expand in the remaining two terms as follows , @xmath42 the result is added to the gn model effective lagrangian . at this stage",
    "it is difficult to predict the precise range of applicability of the approximation due to the unavoidable issue of self - consistency .",
    "we will return to this question once we have solved the non - linear dirac - hf equation .",
    "the final effective lagrangian reads ( @xmath12 )    @xmath43    by construction , it is to be used in the positive energy sector only , since the effects of the negative energy states are already encoded in the lagrangian . for a single baryon ,",
    "the ensuing euler - lagrange equation is the non - linear dirac equation for the ( normalized ) valence spinor , @xmath44 assuming the valence level to be occupied with filling fraction @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the valence fermion number ) and using @xmath47 for ease of notation ( all @xmath48 s disappear ) , the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials are expressed self - consistently as ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 through scalar ( @xmath51 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath52 ) valence level condensates @xmath53 it seems hopeless to solve the complicated non - linear dirac equation ( [ c3]-[c5 ] ) in closed analytical form .",
    "however , since the lagrangian ( [ c2 ] ) is an approximate one , it is sufficient to solve the equation perturbatively in some formal expansion parameter . we choose to expand in @xmath54 and postpone till later the discussion of the validity of the truncation scheme . in order to solve the dirac equation",
    ", we then find that we first have to solve a simple non - linear differential equation , followed by a sequence of inhomogeneous , linear differential equations .",
    "the lengthy analytical computations can be done conveniently with computer algebra ( we used maple ) , therefore we skip the details and record only the final results .",
    "the baryon mass ( computed from the classical field energy ) has the following power series expansion in @xmath47 , @xmath55 the energy @xmath56 of the valence level is closely related to @xmath57 . according to standard hf theory ,",
    "the single particle energy can be interpreted as removal energy of a fermion , or equivalently @xmath58 this is indeed what we find in the calculation , so that there is no need to spell out @xmath56 .",
    "next we turn to the hf potentials ( [ c4 ] ) derived from the self - consistent valence level spinor @xmath59 . for the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials ,",

    ", the same parameter will govern the asymptotic exponential decay of the potentials in a no - sea hf calculation .",
    "this is exactly what eq .",
    "( [ c13 ] ) , together with the shape of the potentials @xmath39 and @xmath69 , guarantees .",

    "( [ b3 ] ) , @xmath91 another case of interest is weak occupation of the valence level , i.e. , taking the formal expansion in @xmath54 literally .",

    "we wind up this section with a summary of the analytical results obtained in secs .",
    "[ sect2 ] and [ sect3 ] . from a practical point of view , it is fairly easy to judge the quality of an effective theory by comparing successive orders in the expansion .",

    "we only display the result if the highest order correction kept contributes less than 0.002 of the total result ( other numerical values for the tolerance would give qualitatively similar plots ) .",
    "this shows clearly that the derivative expansion ( curve starting at @xmath100 ) and the no - sea effective theory ( tilted surface ) are valid in disjoint regions of the diagram , separated by a gap .",
    "needless to say , the no - sea calculation is also valid at higher values of @xmath15 not shown here .",
    "the structure of the baryons is very different , depending on which asymptotic expansion we look at .",
    "baryons described by the derivative expansion have no filled positive energy level , so that baryon number is entirely due to fermion number induced in the dirac sea .",
    "if on the other hand the no - sea effective theory applies , there has to be a positive energy valence level , and the valence fermion density dominates over the induced one , cf .",
    "the powers of @xmath63 in eqs .",
    "( [ c17],[c18 ] ) .",
    "our formulae also show that in the limit of large @xmath15 for fixed @xmath54 , or in the limit of small @xmath54 for fixed @xmath15 , the pseudoscalar terms are suppressed and the njl@xmath3 results converge to those of the gn model .",
    "in fact , a non - relativistic approximation to the dirac equation would be perfectly adequate in this regime .",
    "the region where the uppermost filled level reaches the middle of the gap and crosses zero energy lies in the white part of fig .",

    "a proper choice of the origin in coordinate space then leads to the following symmetry relations for the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials , @xmath107 together with the reality conditions for @xmath39 and @xmath69 , we then find that the coefficients @xmath108 are real and satisfy @xmath109 the zero mode @xmath110 of @xmath111 acts like a mass term and will be denoted by @xmath112 ( not to be confused with the physical fermion mass in the vacuum set equal to 1 throughout this paper ) .",

    "regarding the phase diagram , the question of most immediate interest is the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath15 for full occupation @xmath90 .",
    "this is expected to yield a critical ( 2nd order ) curve in the phase diagram at @xmath174 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the numerical points together with the asymptotic expansions , using both derivative expansion and no - sea effective theory . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we compare this newly calculated baryon mass in the massive njl@xmath3 model with the known one from the massive gn model , choosing a somewhat smaller range of @xmath15 as compared to fig .  [ fig4 ] to highlight the differences .",
    "the two curves shown reflect directly the critical lines in the ( @xmath175)-plane at @xmath174 of the respective phase diagrams . as a by - product of the calculation of baryon masses",
    "we also get the single particle energy of the valence levels , i.e. , discrete levels inside the mass gap .",
    "it is instructive to compare these energies between the gn and njl@xmath3 models as well .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the pair of ( charge conjugation ) symmetric states in the gn model which come together at zero energy at @xmath176 ( this point corresponds to a kink and antikink at infinite separation ) .",
    "the baryons in the njl@xmath3 model also feature a pair of discrete states which approach those of the gn model at large @xmath15 . at small @xmath15 ,",
    "they converge to the lower edge of the mass gap , the upper level crossing zero near @xmath177 .",
    "both of these valence levels are fully occupied .",
    "below @xmath178 one would talk about induced fermion number ( the number of negative energy levels changes as compared to the vacuum ) , whereas above @xmath178 one has ordinary valence fermions like in the gn model .",
    "note however that nothing discontinuous happens at the  spectral flow \" point @xmath178 .",
    "this picture nicely illustrates the transition from the massless baryon at @xmath176 ( with baryon number given by winding number of the pion field , like in the skyrmion case ) to the weakly bound non - relativistic baryon emerging at large @xmath15 in either gn or njl@xmath3 models .",
    "the latter one is apparently insensitive to the original type of chiral symmetry , be it u(1 ) or z@xmath3 .",
    "the hf potentials belonging to these calculations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7]-[fig10 ] .",
    "[ fig7 ] is a 3d - plot containing the full information how @xmath39 and @xmath69 depend on @xmath19 for 20 different values of @xmath15 .",
    "the 3 different projections of this plot onto the coordinate planes show the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) and @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) in more detail , as well as parametric contour plots in the @xmath179-plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "we can infer from this last figure that the chiral winding number jumps from 1 to 0 slightly below @xmath180 , where the contour plot hits the origin ( close to the 5th curve from the outside ) .",
    "note that this does not coincide with the value @xmath177 where the upper valence level crosses zero , so that induced fermion number is not directly related to winding number of @xmath22 for larger bare fermion masses .",
    "this is in agreement with the general observation that the integer part of induced fermion number is not topological , being sensitive to spectral flow @xcite .",
    "although it is presumably not relevant for the phase diagram , we now turn to baryons with partially occupied valence level . the hf calculation can be done exactly as before , except that the single particle energy of the upper valence level is weighted by the occupation fraction @xmath54 when calculating the baryon mass .",
    "we have carried out detailed studies of the @xmath54-dependence for the three values @xmath181 and compared the hf results with the no - sea effective theory expected to describe correctly the @xmath182 behavior .",
    "the results for the baryon mass are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig11]-[fig13 ] and again underline the value of the much simpler analytical results .    the self - consistent potentials as a function of @xmath54 are illustrated for the case @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ( the other cases are qualitatively similar ) .",
    "this 3d - plot corresponds to fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , except that now the different curves are obtained by varying @xmath54 at fixed @xmath15 rather than @xmath15 at fixed @xmath54 .",
    "the similarity between figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig14 ] is quite remarkable .",
    "depleting the valence level has apparently a very similar effect as increasing the bare fermion mass , i.e. , it drives the njl@xmath3 baryon into the non - relativistic regime where it becomes indistinguishable from the gn baryon .    in order to summarize the results obtained in the present work , we have combined all the available points from the numerical hf calculations with the analytical results taken from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "the numerical points start to fill the white gap in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and match perfectly onto the analytical predictions in the region where these can be trusted .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in the 2d - plots of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig11][fig13 ] .",
    "we do not show any results for @xmath183 where the asymptotic formula ( [ c20 ] ) is fully adequate . notice that when the present work was started , only the short solid curve starting at @xmath184 had been known from the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "this paper is part of an ongoing effort to establish the phase diagram of ( large @xmath0 ) gross - neveu type models .",
    "ultimately , we would like to construct the phase diagram of the massive njl@xmath3 model in @xmath185 space in a similarly complete fashion as what has already been achieved for the massive gn model .",
    "one important building block which was still missing are the baryons in the massive njl@xmath3 model .",
    "the only source of information so far was the derivative expansion , restricted to the vicinity of the chiral limit and to completely filled single particle levels .",
    "after briefly reviewing these results , we have identified another parameter region where systematic analytical approximations can be performed , namely the non - relativistic regime ( heavy fermions or weak filling of the valence level ) . here , a recently developed no - sea effective theory has proven to be very efficient .",
    "the gap between these two asymptotic approaches could only be filled at the expense of full numerical hf calculations including the dirac sea . as a result , we have obtained a rather comprehensive picture of how the baryon evolves from a skyrme - type topological object in the chiral limit to a non - relativistic valence bound state . the transition from induced fermion number to valence fermion number has a simple interpretation in terms of spectral flow as a function of the confinement parameter , as discussed in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the heavy fermion limit",
    ", it becomes irrelevant whether the model had originally a u(1 ) or z@xmath3 chiral symmetry , and the results for the massive njl@xmath3 and gn models converge .",
    "as compared to the massive gn model with its complete analytical solution , the analysis of the massive njl@xmath3 model is significantly more involved .",
    "although the self - consistent potentials which we find numerically appear to have simple shapes , we have not been able to come up with an analytical solution .",
    "one source of difficulty is the fact that the potentials in the njl@xmath3 model are not reflectionless .",
    "related to this , even in those limits where we have analytical control , the potentials do not lead to any known exactly solvable dirac equation .",
    "if this problem is analytically tractable at all , the techniques must be quite different from those which have been successful in the gn model case .    finally ,",
    "coming back to the phase diagram , we have in fact determined one particular phase boundary in the present work .",
    "like in the gn model , the @xmath174 base line of the phase diagram in ( @xmath186 ) space is expected to be given by the curve @xmath187 of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
