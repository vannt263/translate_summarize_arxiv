    "-5 mm    in this paper , our interest is to prove local solvability for quasilinear wave equations of the type @xmath1 where  @xmath2 is a smooth function vanishing at  @xmath3 with value in  @xmath4 such that  @xmath5 is a convex compact subset of the set of positive symmetric matrices and  @xmath6 is a quadratic form on  @xmath7 .",
    "our interest proceeds also for cubic quasilinear wave equations of the type @xmath8 where  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 are quadratic forms on  @xmath7 and where all the quadratic forms are supposed to be smooth functions of  @xmath11 .",
    "the basic tool to prove local solvability for such equations is the following energy estimate , also valid for the symmetric systems @xmath12 so thanks to classical arguments , local solvability derives easily from the control of the quantity @xmath13 in the framework of the equation  @xmath14 , the control of this key quantity requires initial data  @xmath15 in  @xmath16 for  @xmath17 while in the framework of  @xmath18 ( with small data , which makes sense in this case ) it only requires initial data  @xmath15 in  @xmath19 .    the goal of this paper is to go below this regularity for the initial data .",
    "let us first have a look at the scaling properties of equations  @xmath14 and  @xmath18 .",
    "if  @xmath11 is a solution of  @xmath14 or  @xmath18 , then  @xmath20 is also a solution of the same equation . the space which is invariant under this scaling for the couple  @xmath15 is  @xmath21 .",
    "so the results given by the classical energy estimate appear to require more regularity than the scaling in the two cases .",
    "in fact , the energy methods despise the particular properties of the wave equation .",
    "it is on the impulse of the pioneer work of s. klainerman ( see ) that a vast series of works have been attached to improve the span life time of regular solutions of quasilinear wave equations using the lorentz invariance .",
    "let us notice the results of s. alinhac ( see and ) , of l. hrmander ( see ) , of f. john ( see ) , of f. john and s. klainerman ( see ) , of s. klainerman ( see ) and of j-m.delort ( ) concerning the klein - gordon equation .    in this talk , we shall limit our self to the question of minimal regularity . concerning this subject , the only case studied is the semilinear case , which means the case of the equation  @xmath14 with  @xmath22 .",
    "as it has been shown by s. klainerman and m.machedon ( see and @xcite ) we can , when the quadratic form  @xmath6 verifies a structure condition known by  null condition \" , nearly reach the space invariant by scaling . for any quadratic form  @xmath6 , we have the following theorem , proved by g. ponce and t. sideris in    [ ondesemilinstritheo ] let us define  @xmath23 by @xmath24 let  @xmath15 be a cauchy data in  @xmath25 with  @xmath26 then there exists a time  @xmath27 such that there exists a unique solution  @xmath11 of the equation  @xmath14 such that @xmath28;h^s)\\cap lip([0,t];h^{s-1})\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad \\partial u\\in l^2([0,t];l^\\infty).\\ ] ]    the proof of this result lies on specific properties of the wave equation , namely the following strichartz estimate @xmath29 indeed , if we couple it with the standard energy estimate @xmath30 we obtain , owing to the tame estimates and the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath31 which ensures by the theory of evolution equations the local solvability for  @xmath32    in other respects , in , h. linblad shows that for  @xmath33 the above result is optimum , which means that the problem  @xmath14 with  @xmath22 is not wellposed in  @xmath34 .",
    "let us also notice that the same kind of result is also true on the heisenberg group ( see ) .",
    "the authors ( see and ) adjust a method followed by d. tataru ( see ) based on microlocal analysis to improve the minimal regularity for the equation  @xmath14 in the quasilinear case .",
    "let us recall this result    [ ondequasilinstritheo ] _",
    "if  @xmath35 , let  @xmath15 be in  @xmath25 for  @xmath36 with  @xmath37 then , a positive time  @xmath27 exists such that a unique solution  @xmath11 of the equation  @xmath14 exists such that @xmath38;h^{s-1})\\cap   l^2([0,t];l^\\infty).\\ ] ] _    * remarks *    * this theorem has been proved with  @xmath39 instead than  @xmath40 in and then improved a little bit in and proved with  @xmath40 by d. tataru in .",

    "* let us notice that the improvement with  @xmath40 of d. tataru in is due to a different manner of counting the intervals where microlocal estimates are true .",
    "* recently , s. klainerman and i. rodnianski in have obtained a better index in dimension 3 .",
    "their proof is based on very different methods .",
    "* let us notice that we have also improved the minimal regularity in dimension 2 , but the gain is only of  @xmath41 derivative , this is explained by the mean dispersif effect in this dimension already known for the constant case .",

    "this fact appears in the statement of theorem through the following phenomenon : the fact that  @xmath49 is in  @xmath54 does not imply that the time derivative of  @xmath2 belongs to  @xmath52 .",
    "of course this condition is crucial in particular to get the basic energy estimate .",
    "but we have been unable to exhibit a banach space  @xmath55 which contains the solution  @xmath11 and such that if a function  @xmath56 is in  @xmath55 , then  @xmath57 belongs to  @xmath52 . * for technical obstructions , this theorem is limited to the dimensions  @xmath58 .",
    "-5 mm    following the process of g. ponce and t. sideris in , we reduce the proof of the theorem to the following a priori estimate    [ quasistrichartz ] _ if  @xmath35 , a constant c exists such that , for any regular solution u of the equation  @xmath14 , if @xmath59 then we have @xmath60 _    the estimate in hand must be understood as a strichartz estimate for wave equations with variable coefficients and not very regular .",
    "the strichartz estimates have a long history begining with segal s work for the wave equation with constant coefficients .",
    "after the fundamental work of strichartz , it was developed by diverse authors , we refer to the synthesis article of ginibre and velo to which it is advisable to add the recents works of keel - tao consecrated to some limited cases and of bahouri , grard and xu for the wave equation on the heisenberg group .",
    "for strichartz estimates with  @xmath61 coefficients , we refer to the result of l. kapitanski ( see ) .",
    "the article of h. smith ( see ) constitutes an important step in the study of strichartz estimates for operators with coefficients not very regular since it proves strichartz estimates with coefficients only  @xmath62 .",
    "we shall now explain how to establish this quasilinear strichartz estimate , showing where are the difficulties and what are the essential ideas which allow to overcome them .",
    "the method known to prove these estimates uses a representation , eventually approximate , but always explicit of the solution . in the case of the wave equation ,",
    "the approximation used is the one coming from the lax method , namely the one connected to the geometrical optics . to make such a method work in the framework of quasilinear wave equations",
    "requires a `` regularization '' of the coefficients also in time .",
    "this leads to the following iterative scheme introduced in .",
    "let us define the sequence  @xmath63 by the first term  @xmath64 satisfying @xmath65 and by the following induction @xmath66 where",
    "@xmath67 with  @xmath68 and  @xmath69 a function of  @xmath70 - 1,1[)$ ] whose value is  @xmath71 near  @xmath3 and where  @xmath72 is a frequencies truncated operator which only conserves the frequencies lower than  @xmath73 .",
    "let us introduce some notations which will be used all along this section .",
    "if  @xmath74 where  @xmath75 is a small positive number , let us define @xmath76    the assertion we have to prove by induction , for  @xmath77 small enough , is the following : if  @xmath78 , @xmath79    for this , we shall transform the equation  @xmath80 into a paradifferential equation , more precisely an equation of the type @xmath81 where the term @xmath82 is a remainder term estimated as agreed and where  @xmath83 denotes the part of  @xmath11 which is relative to the frequencies of size  @xmath84 .    this transformation of the equation , which is the classical paralinearization defined by j .-",
    "bony in is here not sufficient , since it is well known that the paradifferential operators defined in belong to a bad class of pseudodifferential operators ( class @xmath85 of hrmander ) , class in particular devoid of any asymptotic calculus , which forbids of course to envisage any approximate method of type  lax method \" .",
    "the idea is as in to truncate more in the frequencies of the metric  @xmath2 and to transform the equation @xmath86 on the following equation @xmath87 @xmath88 where  @xmath89 and  @xmath90 is a frequencies truncated operator which conserves only the frequencies smaller than  @xmath91",
    ". we can interpret it as a localization in the pseudodifferential calculus sense  @xmath92 of hrmander .",
    "this localization allows us to construct an approximation of the solution but engenders a loss in the remainder  @xmath93 .",
    "this approximation is on the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation and @xmath96 is a symbol calculated by resolving a sequence of transport equations ; it is about a classical method .",
    "but , on account of the the caustic phenomenon , this approximation is microlocal , which means valid only a time interval whose length depends on the size of the frequencies we work with .    nevertheless , following the classical method , we prove microlocal strichartz estimates @xmath97 for any positive  @xmath98 , where  @xmath99 and  @xmath100 satisfies @xmath101 where  @xmath102 and latexmath:[\\[\\label{conditiondecoupst0 }    the hamilton - jacobi equation while the condition is required by the asymptotic calculus to turn out the  lax method \" .    finally to prove the complete estimate , the method we used consists in a decomposition of the interval  @xmath0 $ ] on subintervals  @xmath104 on which the above microlocalized estimates are true .",
    "the key point is a careful counting of the number of such intervals , for this we shall use here d. tataru s version of the method we introduced in .",
    "the idea consists to seize at the opportunity of this decomposition to compensate the loss on the remainder . to do so",
    ", we impose on the interval  @xmath104 the supplementary condition @xmath105 where the parameter  @xmath106 is to be determined in the interval  @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "this constraint joint to the conditions and leads by optimization to the best choice @xmath108 and allows to conclude that the number  @xmath109 of such intervals is less than  @xmath110 .",
    "if we denote by  @xmath111 the partition of the interval  @xmath0 $ ] on such intervals , we can write thanks to , @xmath112 as  @xmath113 is less than  @xmath114 , we obtain @xmath115    now as the loss in the remainder  @xmath116 is of order  @xmath117 and more precisely , for  @xmath118 small enough , we have @xmath119 where  @xmath120 .",
    "we deduce , owed to the choice of  @xmath121 that @xmath122 which implies the result by summation .",
    "-5 mm    the method used here is not without any interaction with the one used to prove the theorem . as in the case of equation  @xmath14 ,",
    "the basic fact is the control of @xmath123 and the proof of the theorem follows from the following a priori estimate          * remark * we find a gain of one derivative from the regularity of the initial data compared with the product laws and a gain of half a derivative about the regularity of the initial data compared with purely strichartz methods .    to explain the basic ideas of bilinear estimates ,",
    "let us first consider the case of constant coefficients . as  @xmath129 @xmath130 , we have to control expression of the type @xmath131 for this we introduce bony s decomposition which consists in writing @xmath132 when  @xmath42 , we have  @xmath133 , then it is easy to prove that @xmath134 the symmetric term can be treated exactly along the same lines .",
    "the remainder term @xmath135 is much more difficult to treat in particular in dimension  @xmath136 .",
    "the idea introduced by d. tataru and s. klainerman ( see ) consists to treat this term using precised strichartz estimates and interaction lemma .",
    "the precised strichartz estimates are described by the following proposition .",
    "[ corstrichatz1 + ] _ let  @xmath137 be a ring of  @xmath138 .",
    "if  @xmath35 , a constant  @xmath139 exists such that for any  @xmath27 and any  @xmath140 , if  @xmath141 are included in a ball of radius  @xmath142 and in the ring  @xmath137 , we have @xmath143where  @xmath11 denotes the solution of  @xmath144 and  @xmath145 . _",
    "[ lemmestrichatz1 + ] _ a constant  @xmath139 exists such that if  @xmath147 and  @xmath148 are functions in  @xmath149 such that @xmath150 then , for any  @xmath151 between  @xmath3 and  @xmath152 , we have @xmath153 where  @xmath11 denotes the solution of  @xmath144 and  @xmath145 . _         interaction lemma \" _ there exists a constant c such that if  @xmath155 and  @xmath156 are two solutions of  @xmath157 satisfying  @xmath158 with  @xmath159 we have for ,  @xmath160 @xmath161 where  @xmath162 is a radial function in  @xmath163 which is equal to 1 near the origin . _    let us define  @xmath164 a partition of unity of the ring  @xmath137 such that  @xmath165 .",
    "then , using the fact that the support of the fourier transform of the product of two functions is included in the sum of the support of their fourier transform , a family of functions  @xmath166 exists such that  @xmath167 and @xmath168 applying proposition gives @xmath169 the cauchy schwarz inequality implies that @xmath170 the almost orthogonality of  @xmath171 and  @xmath172 implies and leads then to the estimate of the remainder term by rescaling .    to establish the theorem",
    ", we shall follow the steps of the proof of the theorem which consists owed to the gluing method to reduce the problem to the proof of  microlocal \" bilinear estimates .",
    "the generalization of the precised strichartz estimates to the framework of the equation  @xmath18 does nt cost more than the generalization of the strichartz estimates to the framework of the equation  @xmath14 , the supplementary difficulty to study the equation  @xmath18 lies in the generalization of the interaction lemma .",
    "the preservation of the support of the fourier transform by the flow of the wave equation is the crucial point in the proof of this lemma .",
    "the defect of this property in the case of the variable coefficients constitutes the additional major problem in the proof of the theorem .    to palliate this difficulty , we have used a finer localization in phase space .",
    "this localization is given by the concept of microlocalized function near a point  @xmath173 of the cotangent space  @xmath174 ( the cotangent space of  @xmath138 ) .",
    "more precisely , if we consider the positive quadratic form g on  @xmath174 defined by @xmath175 a function  @xmath11 in  @xmath176 is said to be microlocalized in  @xmath177 a point of  @xmath174 if @xmath178 are finite , where @xmath179 denotes the g - ball of center x and radius r , the operator  @xmath180 is defined by @xmath181 and @xmath182    this notion due to j .-",
    "m.bony  ( @xcite ) means that the function  u is concentrated in space near the point  @xmath183 and in frequency near the point  @xmath184 and behaves well against the product , namely , we show that if @xmath185 where  @xmath186 if  @xmath187 then for any  @xmath109 , we have @xmath188 where  @xmath189 .",
    "anyway , the choice of the localization metric  @xmath2 is essential and it is crucial to impose that the size of the g - balls is preserved by hamiltonian flow which leads to the only choice  @xmath190 thanks to the properties of the solution of the associate hamilton jacobi equation .",
    "the key point in the generalization of the bilinear estimate is the proof that for solutions of a variable coefficients wave equation , microlocalization properties propagate nicely along the hamiltonian flows related to the wave operator ; this point follows from the choice of the metric used to localize in the cotangent space of  @xmath138 .    finally to end the proof of the microlocal bilinear estimate , the strategy consists to decompose the cauchy data using unity partition whose elements are supported in g - balls and then to apply the product and the propagation theorems to concentrate on real interaction ( see the proof in the constant coefficient case ) .",
    "because of the fact that interaction in the product and propagation of microlocalization are badly related , we need at this step to recourse to a second microlocalization , which means that we have to decompose again the interval on which we work on sub intervals where the hamiltonian flow is nearly constant .",
