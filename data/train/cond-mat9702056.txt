    "<S> the boson - fermion model , describing a mixture of hybridized localized bosons and itinerant fermions on a lattice , is known to exhibit spectral properties for the fermions which upon lowering the temperature develop into a three pole structure in the vicinity of the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> these spectral features go hand in hand with the opening of a pseudogap in the density of states upon approaching the critical temperature @xmath0 when superconductivity sets in . in the present work we study this model , in the atomic limit where the three pole structure arises naturally from the local bonding , anti - bonding and non - bonding states between the bosons and fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> the boson fermion model presents one of the possible scenarios which are presently widely discussed in connection with the phenomenon of high @xmath0 superconductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model treats localized bosons ( such as bi - polarons ) which are locally hybridized with pairs of itinerant fermions ( band electrons ) . on the basis of this model one envisages the opening of a pseudogap in the density of states of the electrons as the temperature decends below a certain characteristic temperature @xmath1@xcite and approaches @xmath0 from above . </S>",
    "<S> the opening of the pseudogap has been attributed to a precursor effect of superfluid phase fluctuations@xcite with the amplitude of the order parameter remaining finite . near the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> this is tantamount to the existence of resonance two - particle states into which most of the electrons are engaged . </S>",
    "<S> the physical implications of these one - particle features on the thermodynamic , transport and magnetic properties demonstrate this behaviour , which radically differs from that expected for classical fermi liquids@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations from fermi liquid properties are manifest in a complex three - pole structure of the one - particle electron green s function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these findings have been obtained by solving selfconsistently the equations for the boson and fermion selfenergies using a diagramatic conserving approximation , a procedure from which the underlying physics could be infered .    in this paper , we show that some of these physical interpretations can indeed be put on a firm basis when studying the atomic limit of this model . in this case , the local interaction between a hard core boson and a pair of fermion ( having opposite spins ) on each site of the lattice can be diagonalized exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic part of the fermions is subsequently treated in an approximation  la hubbard .    </S>",
    "<S> the boson - fermion hamiltonian in the wannier representation is given by@xcite @xmath2 @xmath3,\\ ] ] where the sum over @xmath4 runs over the @xmath5 nearest neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 denotes the chemical potential , @xmath7 the localized boson level , @xmath8 the hopping integral for the fermions and @xmath9 the strength of the local hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic operators @xmath10 anticommute while the bosonic operators @xmath11 commute for different sites and anticommute for the same site . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space for each site is then the direct product of the fermionic and bosonic states : @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bonding and anti - bonding eigenstates are @xmath14 with the associated eigenvalues @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> this green s function contains three poles with spectral weights @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in the expression for this green s function , equ.(5 ) , determines the contribution from the non - bonding one - particle fermionic states , while the second term is reminiscent of bogoliubov type excitations and contains the effect of hybridized two - particle bonding and respectively anti - bonding states , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the remainder of this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the symmetric case i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for which @xmath31 we then obtain @xmath32 and are thus left with only one parameter , namely @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - bonding component , corresponding to the single particle pole @xmath34 has a finite spectral weight for any @xmath35 , while for @xmath36 it vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now generalize the above atomic green s function to the case of a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding green s function @xmath37 is obtained by adding  la hubbard the kinetic term which is diagonal in @xmath38-space :    @xmath39^{-1 } \\ ; - \\ ; t_{\\bf k}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the fourier s transformation of the hopping term@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the three - pole structure is then repercuted from the atomic green s function onto the lattice green s function whose dispersion branches are illustrated in fig.(1 ) and which resemble those previously derived by us on the basis of a selfconsistent diagramatic approach@xcite . using a free parabolic density of states of the form @xmath41 where d denoted the bandwidth of the fermions @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a one - particle green s function , which has the following two - pole structure :    @xmath43    provided the temperature is exactly equal to zero . with @xmath44 , </S>",
    "<S> this form is reminiscent of the one - particle green s function exhibiting a bogoliubov like spectrum as in the case of a bcs superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding density of states    @xmath45\\ ] ]    with @xmath46 and @xmath47 thus shows a gap of size @xmath48 at the fermi level @xmath49 for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> our previous study of the boson fermion model clearly showed indications for such a gap in form of a dip in the density of states which deepened upon lowering the temperature @xcite .    for any finite temperature @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> the density of states @xmath50 at the fermi level turns out to be finite and moreover we find @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> what changes with temperature is the spectral weight @xmath52 of the normal contribution of the single particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it decreases to zero as the temperature decreases which is manifest in a gradual narrowing of the peak in @xmath50 corresponding to the non - bonding one - particle state , centered arround the fermi level as illustrated in fig.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour can be derived from the expression for the one - particle green s function which in the limit @xmath53 can be derived from the correspondingly approximated spectral function    @xmath54    the density of states is then obtained as @xmath55 from which we can see the narrowing down of the peak associated in the non - bonding component of the spectrum which scales the free density of states @xmath56 with the temperature dependent factor @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> > from the present discussion we see that the opening of the pseudogap obtained in our previous selfconsistent treatment of the boson - fermion model@xcite is clearly associated with the disappearence of the non - bonding component of the spectrum . as the temperature </S>",
    "<S> is decreased its spectral weight is transfered into the contributions coming from the hybridized boson - fermion pairs in bonding and anti - bonding states . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions to the density of states are centered around @xmath57 ( for which moreover we have @xmath58 for @xmath59 , as can be seen directly from eq.(10 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature variation of the partial density of states , coming from those non - bonding contributions , is illustrated in fig.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that it scales with @xmath52 and that it shows a marked saturation above a certain characteristic temperature which we identify with the temperature @xmath1 where a pseudogap opens up in the density of states and which was previously obtained by us using a fully selfconsistent treatment of the boson - fermion model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation above @xmath1 , which is of the order of the coupling constant @xmath9 , corresponds to a blocking of the boson - fermion - pair exchange mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the present treatment of the boson - fermion model captures the underlying physics of the opening of a pseudogap in the density of states due to strong local two - particle bonding and anti - bonding resonances which increase in spectral weight as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the superfluid pair susceptibility for the bosons @xmath60 and for the fermions @xmath61 , which tends to a finite value as @xmath62 decreases to zero . </S>",
    "<S> given the onsite green s fuctions @xmath63 \\rangle$ ] and @xmath64 \\rangle$ ] , the superfluid pair susceptibilities for the bosons and fermions are determided by @xmath65 in the limit @xmath66 we hence obtain @xmath67 and @xmath68 , instead of @xmath69 as for the uncoupled system , which indicates the strong two - particle resonance behaviour without any superfluid coherence . </S>",
    "<S> a further indication for strong pairing in the normal state comes from the expectation value of the number of pairs @xmath70 in the limit of the temperature going to zero , i.e. , @xmath66 we obtain @xmath71 , thus showing a significant enhancement over its free particle value , which is @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results , obtained in the atomic limit , clearly demonstrate that the pseudogap in the dos of the fermions is linked to the strong local pair correlations in the normal state with any global phase coherence being absent . a more refined treatment of those local resonant states ( such as given in our previous study@xcite which includes spatial correlations of the two - particle resonant states ) leads in the normal state to a `` pair liquid '' with fluctuations of a condensate of those two - particle states , which ultimately changes the nature of the gap leading to a superconducting ground state . </S>"
