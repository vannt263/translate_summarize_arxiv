    "over the last decades wide - field imaging surveys have systematically revealed new satellite companions to the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "especially , the sloan digital sky survey  ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was instrumental in establishing a new class of stellar systems , the ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thereby more than doubling the number of known mw satellite galaxies over half the northern hemisphere .",
    "deep imaging follow - ups and spectroscopic studies suggest that the ufds hold typically old  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and metal poor  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stellar populations .",
    "the high mass - to - light ratios of the ufds ( @xmath9 ) inferred from internal kinematics  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is one of properties that differentiate them from star clusters  @xcite .",
    "the efforts to find new mw satellites over a larger area of sky continued with the vst atlas  @xcite and pan - starrs @xmath10 ( k. chambers et al . , in preparation ) surveys , both of which have delivered a couple of discoveries to date  @xcite .",
    "most recently , systematic searches based on the first data release ( y1a1 ) of the dark energy survey  ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have continued the success of its predecessor the sdss , unveiling nine new objects over @xmath11 square degrees in the southern sky  @xcite , some of which have been already confirmed as ufds by spectroscopic investigations  @xcite .",
    "other independent surveys , such as the stromlo missing satellite survey  @xcite and the survey of the magellanic stellar history ( smash ; d. nidever et al . , in preparation ) , also took advantage of the power of the dark energy camera ( decam ) to boost the census of mw companions in the southern sky  @xcite .",
    "the use of different detection algorithms also contributed significantly to the increase in the number of known mw satellites  @xcite . due to their extremely low surface brightness  @xcite , ufds would be difficult to characterised without the help of such specialised data mining techniques .",
    "further improvements to the detection sensitivity even led to new discoveries of stellar systems hiding in the pre - existing sdss data  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we announce the discovery of a new ultra - faint mw satellite galaxy candidate found in the des y1a1 data .",
    "we note that this object horologiumii ( horii ) does not correspond to any object in the previous studies by @xcite and @xcite or in catalogs including the nasa / ipac extragalactic database and simbad .",
    "des is a deep photometric survey using the wide - field ( @xmath12 square degree ) dark energy camera ( decam ) imager that consists of 62 2k @xmath13 4k ccd chips installed at the 4-m blanco telescope located at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "des started operation in august 2013 and will cover @xmath14 square degrees of the southern sky in the vicinity of the magellanic clouds in five photometric bands ( @xmath15 ) over five years .",
    "the data used in this paper is its first year public data set , desdm y1a1 , collected between august 2013 and february 2014 over approximately 1800 square degrees and released to the public by the noao science archive after a one year proprietary period .",
    "this data set includes individual images and corresponding weight - maps processed by the des data management ( desdm ) pipeline .",
    "each image is a 90s single exposure .",
    "the instcal images we used for our analysis are bias , dark and flat - field corrected and contain the world coordinate system provided by the desdm image processing pipeline  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "we downloaded all the y1a1 instcal images and corresponding weight - maps for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands from the noao science archive using its sql interface . crossmatching",
    "the central coordinates of the images within @xmath18 radius yielded 1980 image pairs between the two photometric bands . to produce photometric catalogs , we performed psf photometry over the images using sextractor / psfex  @xcite on a local 16 nodes/128 core computer cluster .",
    "we carried out star / galaxy separation based on the threshold @xmath19 as described in @xcite .",
    "the catalogs , which contained the instrumental magnitudes of the star - like objects , were crossmatched between @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands by employing stilts  @xcite with a @xmath20 tolerance .",
    "we then calibrated the instrumental magnitudes of the star - like point sources with respect to the apass dr8 stars by means of 500 bootstrap samples with 3-sigma clipping . on average , we found @xmath21 crossmatches between the instrumental and apass catalogs on each frame , which yielded photometric zero points with uncertainties @xmath22 magnitudes in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands .",
    "the calibrated magnitudes were finally corrected for galactic extinction using the reddening map by  @xcite and the correction coefficients from  @xcite .",
    "we then applied our overdensity detection algorithm to the star catalogs to search for mw satellites .",
    "briefly , this algorithm , following the approach by  @xcite , involves a photometric filtering process in which an isochrone mask is applied to select a single age / metallicity stellar population at a fixed distance modulus . the density map generated from the selected stars is then convolved with a gaussian kernel .",
    "the significance of local stellar overdensities is measured by comparing their signal - to - noise ratios to the smoothed density map .",
    "these steps are repeated shifting the isochrone mask over a range of distance moduli .",
    "the detection process is described in more details in  @xcite . as part of this photometric analysis of the entire 1800 sqr deg of @xmath23 images of the y1a1 data set",
    ", we successfully recovered all the ufd candidates reported by @xcite and @xcite ; e.g. phoenixii ( @xmath24 ) , pictorisi ( @xmath25 ) , tucanaii ( @xmath26 ) , eridanusiii ( @xmath27 ) , and grusi ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we also found one additional mw satellite candidate in the constellation of horologium .",
    "this new object , horologiumii , was initially detected at the 7 - 8@xmath29 significance levels in two separate , but overlapping decam images . to fill the ccd chip gaps , we combined the photometric catalogs of the two frames and removed duplicates with @xmath20 tolerance .",

    "compared to the control cmd established in the same manner as in  @xcite shown in the right panel , the stars in the vicinity of horii consistently trace the old and metal - poor stellar population from the red - giant branch ( rgb ) down to the main - sequence turn off .",
    "horii also hosts two potential blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",

    "the ml - estimated physical size of horii is @xmath0pc .",
    "the total luminosity of horii is estimated as follows .",
    "briefly , we use the total number of member stars @xmath59 above the photometric threshold ( @xmath60mag ) and its associated uncertainty derived from the ml algorithm run .",
    "we then integrate a normalised theoretical luminosity function as a probability density function of magnitude , by the same magnitude limit and use the ratio of the number @xmath59 to the probability density to scale the luminosity function up to the observed level .",
    "integrating the scaled luminosity function inclusive of missing flux below the threshold gives the absolute luminosity of horii . using the parsec isochrone of 13.5 gyr and [ fe / h]=-2.1 based on the initial mass function by @xcite ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 or @xmath62 by the luminosity weighted mean color @xmath63 of the isochrone .",

    "all the resulting parameters are summarised in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we note that a heliocentric distance of 78kpc was adopted in the calculations of the physical size and total luminosity , to which the distance uncertainty was not propagated .",
    "we analysed the first instalment ( y1a1 ) of the dark energy survey @xmath23 imaging data to search for mw satellites , where we recovered all the previously reported systems and also found a new satellite candidate in the constellation of horologium .",
    "the new mw satellite candidate horii appears faint ( @xmath1 ) , elongated ( @xmath64 ) and rather extended ( @xmath0pc ) . on the size luminosity plane",
    ", horii is placed in the realm of ufds close to botesii .",
    "it also features a typically old ( @xmath2gyr ) and metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) stellar population .",
    "the best isochrone fit yields a heliocentric distance of @xmath5kpc , which is the same as that of a recently discovered neighbour in the des y1a1 coverage , hori .",
    "compared to the new satellite candidate , hori is about twice as luminous ( @xmath65 ) , smaller ( @xmath66pc ) and more circular ( @xmath67 ) , consequently being placed in the somewhat ambiguous region on the size - luminosity plane where ufds and extended globular clusters overlap  @xcite .",
    "a recent spectroscopic study by @xcite has revealed that the dynamical mass - to - light ratio of hori reaches @xmath68 and confirmed that that system is indeed an ufd , possibly ( once ) associated with the lmc .",
    "the pair of ufds , hori and ii , are only @xmath69 degrees away from each other on the sky , have identical distances and are well aligned with the vast polar structure  @xcite .",
    "such ufd pairs have been reported for quite some time e.g. botes i - ii  @xcite , leo iv - v  @xcite and pisces ii - pegasus iii  @xcite .",
