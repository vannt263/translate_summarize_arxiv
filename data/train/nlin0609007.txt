    "the separation between the beads measures the extension of the polymer . when introduced into a non - uniform flow the molecule experiences collisions with fluid particles and",
    "becomes stretched under the action of the velocity gradient . in the simplest case ,",
    "the drag force is assumed to be proportional to the velocity of the polymer relative to the fluid and thermal agitation is modelled by brownian motion . in most applications",
    "the extension of the polymer remains smaller than the dissipative scale of the carrier flow , and therefore the velocity field can be assumed to be linear .",

    "we consider the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) dumbbell model with @xmath12 where  @xmath13 is the maximum extension of the molecule .",

    "the physical reason is the large number of polymer configurations close to the coil  stretch transition . at intermediate weissenberg numbers polymer conformation results from a critical competition between the entropic force and the velocity gradient .",
    "therefore , around the transition , coiled and stretched polymer coexist in the flow , and this makes the relaxation to the equilibrium pdf particularly long .",
    "it is worth noticing that the amplification of the relaxation time is stronger when hydrodynamic interactions are taken into account ; this behaviour is intimately related to the finite - time conformation hysteresis observed in elongational flows ( celani _ et al .",
