    "in the current effort to open the gravitational wave astronomy frontier , a space - based laser - interferometric gravitational wave detector operating in the 0.1  mhz to 100  mhz waveband is far and away the most promising marriage of technological capability and number and variety of strong sources . in its",
    "most studied form a space - based laser interferometric gravitational wave detector involves three free - flying sciencecraft  acting as the stations of an interferometer  inhabiting 1  au circumsolar orbits arranged so that the sciencecraft form an equilateral triangle constellation , inclined to the ecliptic plane by @xmath0 , with arm lengths of several million km @xcite . once set in their orbits the orientation of the interferometer with respect to the celestial sphere",
    "is determined by kepler s laws of motion ; correspondingly , the initial orientation of the equilateral triangle in its plane affects the detector s sensitivity to gravitational waves sources in different regions of the sky . in all present proposals",
    "only one of the sciencecraft is equipped to measure the relative velocity to both of the other two sciencecraft ; so , only one interferometer can be synthesized @xcite . here",
    "we show how the freedom to choose the initial orientation of the sciencecraft constellation  and , thus , the orientation of the interferometer  affects the detector s sensitivity to gravitational waves associated with sources in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "@xcite first investigated the design aspects of a space - based , laser interferometric gravitational wave detector .",
    "the mission and detector they described quickly converged to the modern `` lisa '' concept that , in its most mature form , is described in several technical assessments performed for esa @xcite .    in the modern lisa concept",
    "each of the three sciencecraft follow independent , circumsolar orbits that lead or lag earth in its orbit by tens of degrees .",
    "each sciencecraft hosts a freely floating reference mass ( a `` gravitational reference sensor '' , or grs ) that it simultaneously shields from the thermal and particle space environment and tracks to ensure that the sciencecraft trajectory is as close to a free trajectory through space - time as technology allows .",
    "modulated laser signals passed between the sciencecraft are used to measure the relative velocities of the three reference masses .",
    "gravitational waves passing through the constellation lead to correlated disturbances in these relative velocity measurements .",
    "the gravitational wave antenna that is synthesized from the relative velocity measurements of the three reference masses behaves like an interferometer with one sciencecraft acting as a beamsplitter and the other two acting as end - stations @xcite . like an interferometer its greatest sensitivity is to sources in the directions normal to the plane defined by the three sciencecraft . also like an interferometer",
    "the antenna has four nulls  directions in which it is entirely insensitive to gravitational wave sources  that lie in the plane .",
    "the direction of these nulls is tied to the orientation of the sciencecraft in their plane .",
    "the requirement that the sciencecraft each travel freely through space yet maintain , over several orbital periods , the same relative configuration , strongly constrains the sciencecraft orbits @xcite , leading each null to trace - out a `` figure - eight '' pattern on the sky over the course of a year . where these patterns appear on the sky is set by the initial orientation of the sciencecraft in their plane .",
    "our purpose here is to demonstrate how the choice of initial constellation orientation affects the sensitivity of lisa concept detectors to the direction hosting the greatest number of gravitational wave sources : i.e. , the galactic center .",
    "section [ sec : measure ] of this manuscript describes our sensitivity measure for a lisa concept gravitational wave antenna as it orbits sol .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] examines the sensitivity of a lisa concept mission to gravitational wave sources in the direction of milky way galactic center and some of the more important milky way globular clusters .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section[sec : concl ] .",
    "we base our measure of lisa s sensitivity to point gravitational wave sources on its low - frequency angular response . for our purposes",
    "the three lisa sciencecraft correspond to the beamsplitter and end - mirrors of a michelson delay - line interferometer .",
    "each sciencecraft is on an independent , 1  au circumsolar orbit .",
    "these orbits are chosen so that the sciencecraft remain close to relative rest at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with @xmath1  km legs .",
    "we refer to the relative position of the sciencecraft as the _ constellation_. tidal forces on the constellation owing to sol , the earth - moon system , jupiter and venus all act to distort this configuration .",
    "the lisa mission lifetime is bounded by an upper limit on the relative sciencecraft velocities .",
    "this bound will be exceeded well - before deviations in the constellation shape affect significantly the angular sensitivity of the interferometer .",
    "correspondingly , it is conventional to treat the constellation as a rigid equilateral triangle whose center follows a kepler orbit , in the ecliptic plane , about sol .",
    "we follow this convention .    to evaluate lisa s response consider a ( tt - gauge ) plane gravitational wave propagating in the @xmath2 direction through minkowski space : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the usual @xmath6 and @xmath7 wave polarization tensors ,    @xmath8    in the low - frequency ( small antenna ) limit the response of the inferometer",

    "our basic measure of lisa s sensitivity is the quadrature sum of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and its value integrated over a year - long observation and normalized so that its maximum value , over all @xmath20 , is unity :    [ eq : rho2 ] @xmath21 where @xmath22    note that the dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath20 is identical to the dependence on @xmath20 of the power signal - to - noise associated with a compact object binary system when averaged over the binary s orientation .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is determined by the motion of the constellation as it orbits sol .",
    "the special orbits that allow the constellation to maintain a relatively stable equilateral triangle configuration enforce upon the constellation a characteristic internal motion and orientation with respect to the constellation s orbital plane . the orientation and motion is particularly simple when described in terms of the constellation plane s orientation relative to its orbital plane about sol , and the orientation of the constellation in the constellation s plane .",
    "the sciencecraft orbits require that the constellation plane is always inclined @xmath0 relative to the ecliptic plane ( i.e. , the constellation s orbital plane ) with the constellation plane normal always in the plane defined by the constellation s orbital radius vector and its orbital plane normal : i.e. , the constellation plane precesses , in a positive sense , about the ecliptic plane normal with a one - year period .",
    "in addition to this precession , the constellation itself spins within its plane , also with a one - year period . choosing the constellation plane normal s direction to have a positive projection on the ecliptic plane normal the constellation spins in its plane with a negative sense .",

    "is in the plane defined by the orbital radius vector and angular momentum , and is directed to have a positive projection on the orbital angular momentum axis .",
    "the constellation then `` orbits '' within its plane in a negative sense with the same period as the constellation s orbit about sol : i.e. , @xmath26 . in this",

    "we choose to work in ( heliocentric ) ecliptic coordinates . to express @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the unit vectors in the direction of the interferometer arms , in ecliptic coordinates we first describe them in the constellation s rest frame",
    "; next , we describe the rotations that relate ecliptic and constellation rest coordinates ; and , finally , we express @xmath15 and @xmath16 in ecliptic coordinates via equations [ eq : qrot ] .",
    "figure [ fig : constellation ] shows the constellation , the interferometer arms , and the constellation rest - frame coordinates that we use to describe the constellation s gravitational wave response . in these coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 are    [ eq : uvconstellation ] @xmath27     and @xmath16 are shown as solid lines connecting the `` beamsplitter '' scienccraft to the `` end station '' sciencecraft . to define cartesian rest - frame coordinates associated with the interferometer we identify the circle that circumscribes the three sciencecraft and choose the @xmath28-axis in the direction from the center of the circumscribed circle through the `` beamsplitter sciencecraft '' .",

    "an interferometric detector has a null response to gravitational - wave sources in four different directions  all in the plane formed by the detector .",
    "when the light travel time along its arms is equal , as is the case for lisa , two of the nulls are in the direction and anti - direction of the bisector between the arms , while the other two nulls are at right angles to these directions : i.e. , in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions in figure [ fig : constellation ] . as the antenna orbits sol these nulls trace out figure-8 patterns on the sky .",

    "[ eq : rho2 ] ) .",
    "note that the ecliptic longitude is unlabeled in figure  [ fig:8s ] .",

    "_ it is a fortunate coincidence that the galactic center lies nearly on the ecliptic plane and the galactic plane , like the lisa constellation plane , is inclined @xmath0 relative to the ecliptic plane : _ just those regions on the sky where the choice of @xmath53 gives us greatest control over lisa s sensitivity . referring to figure [ fig:8s ] , our initial choice of lisa constellation orienation",
    "can make a 17% difference in the constellation s sensitivity toward the galactic center sources : i.e. , to just those sources that dominate lisa s signal . if we choose as our goal the study of these sources we can maximize lisa s sensitivity to the galactic center direction",
    "; alternatively , if our goal is the detection and study of extragalactic sources we can choose lisa s initial orientation to minimize our sensitivity to these ( now confounding ) sources , allowing lisa observations to `` dig deeper '' into the pool of extra - galactic sources .    now consider the binary choice of maximizing or minimizing lisa sensitivity to galactic center sources and ask what effect this choice has on the sensitivity to gravitational wave emitters associated with other localized and nearby objects : in particular , globular clusters within 5 kpc of earth , the large and small magellanic clouds , the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , and the virgo cluster .",
    "these objects are representative of typical hosts for halo and extragalactic populations of white - dwarf binaries , ultra compact binaries , and nearby extreme mass - ratio inspiral systems .",

    "most of the remaining globular clusters ( all marked with stars ) are close enough to the galactic center that lisa s sensitivity to sources within them varies together with sensitivity to the galactic center . only for the globular cluster m71 and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) is the constellations s sensitivity relatively high when it is relatively low for galactic center sources .",

    "the white lines trace out the paths of the nulls.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the modulation of lisa s sensitivity in a given direction provides another means of `` tuning '' lisa s sensitivity to different sources .",

    "this includes most of the sources identified in table  [ tab : sourceloc ] .",
    "to illustrate , figure  [ fig : gcminmax ] shows how the modulation in sensitivity varies over the course of a year for galactic center direction sources when lisa s initial orientation is chosen to maximize or minimize its sensitivity in this direction .",

    "s sensitivity to sources in the direction of the galactic center vanishes just when its sensitivity to sources in the direction of the virgo cluster is greatest , and vice versa .",
    "_ thus , by appropriate pointing of lisa we can mitigate significantly any interference that galactic close white dwarf binaries have in the detection of extra - galactic sources .",
    "the lisa sciencecraft form what is effectively an interferometric gravitational wave antenna .",
    "such an antenna has four nulls : i.e. , directions in which it is entirely insensitive to incident gravitational waves .",

    "the choice of initial constellation orientation can be chosen to ensure that a null traces over , or avoids , any fixed sky location within @xmath0 of the ecliptic plane .",
    "sources in this zone include the galactic center , the virgo cluster , and the nearest galactic globular clusters . by choice of the initial constellation orientation lisa",
    "may thus be pointed toward or away from any of these sources , with significant consequences for the success of its science mission . in the case of sources in the direction of the galactic center",
    "this freedom amounts to a 17% difference in the power signal - to - noise accumulated over a year s observation ( averaged over all source orientations ) .",
    "as important as the variation in the annual signal - to - noise is the variation in the sensitivity _ throughout _ the sciencecraft constellation s annual orbital period .",
    "the relative location of the galactic center and the virgo cluster is such that we may choose a null to cover the galactic center during just those times when the antenna s sensitivity to the virgo cluster is greatest .",
    "thus , we can arrange our orbits to suppress the confusion noise associated with the large number of galactic white dwarf binaries at just those times when our sensitivity to virgo cluster sources is greatest .",
    "the choice of initial constellation orientation need not affect the mission cost .",
    "the dominant cost to the mission associated with a choice of initial constellation orientation is that required to launch the mass in fuel needed to move the sciencecraft from earth to their initial orbital stations .",
    "viewed with respect to earth there is a constellation orientation that requires minimum fuel mass to reach . by appropriate choice of launch date",
    "we can make this cost - preferred earth - relative configuration correspond to any desired ecliptic coordinate relative orientation .",
    "how to best take advantage of the ability to point a lisa - like gravitational wave antenna requires the kind of judgements that are only possible in the context of the mission science goals : e.g. , is the mission s principal science goal the study of galactic sources , extra - galactic sources , or something different still ?",
    "here we have demonstrated that the mission profile includes a heretofore unrealized freedom  the ability to point the antenna toward or away from sources within @xmath0 of the ecliptic plane  and have given but one example of how choices in pointing can affect sensitivity to multiple sources .",
