    "one of the ultimate goals of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in nuclear physics is to make precise model - independent predictions for certain processes that figure importantly in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the only technique presently available to achieve such goals in the low - energy domain is effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite . in this talk",
    ", we apply a variant of nuclear eft developed by the authors to the solar @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes within the framework sketched in @xcite . in doing so , we rely on the accurate wave functions constructed by marcucci et al  @xcite as the essential ingredient of eft coming from the standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa ) .",
    "the power of the proposed scheme is the ability to correlate the beta decay processes of @xmath7 nuclei that allows us to fix one unknown constant in the theory , rendering possible a totally parameter - free prediction of the two - nucleon and four - nucleon processes .",
    "the most abundant source of solar neutrinos ( carrying 91 % of the total flux ) is the @xmath1 process p+pd + e^+ + .",
    "this process has been carefully studied @xcite , and the calculated transition strength , governed by the leading - order gamow - teller ( gt ) operator , is believed to be reasonably reliable .",
    "however , given its extremely important role in the solar burning process , the @xmath1 process invites further elaborate studies .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath2 process 3+p4 + e^+ + . produces the highest energy solar neutrinos , @xmath8  mev .",
    "while the @xmath2 neutrino flux is estimated to be much smaller than the @xmath9 neutrino flux , there can be significant distortion of the @xmath9 neutrino spectrum at its higher end if the @xmath2 @xmath0-factor is much larger than the existing estimates .",
    "this change can influence the interpretation of the results of a recent super - kamiokande experiment that have raised many important issues concerning the solar neutrino problem and neutrino oscillations  @xcite . to address these issues ,",
    "a reliable estimate of the @xmath2 cross section is indispensable .",
    "its accurate evaluation , however , has been a long - standing challenge for nuclear and hadron physics  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty involved is reflected in the pronounced variance in the documented estimates of the @xmath2 @xmath0-factor . for example , the first estimate given by salpeter  @xcite was @xmath10 , which was eventually replaced by the much smaller ( so - called `` standard '' ) value , @xmath11  @xcite ; the latest , most elaborate estimation gives @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the difficulty in making a precise estimation of the @xmath2 @xmath0-factor is multifold .",
    "first , the one - body ( 1b ) gt matrix element for the @xmath2 process is strongly suppressed due to the symmetry properties of the orbital wave functions of the initial and final states .",
    "the main orbital wave function for @xmath13 has [ 4 ] symmetry ( totally symmetric ) under the particle exchanges , whereas the dominant @xmath14 orbital wavefunction has [ 31 ] symmetry ; the [ 4 ] component is forbidden by the pauli principle when there are three protons .",
    "then , the main components of the initial and final states  with different symmetry properties in orbital space  can not be connected by the leading - order ( lo ) gt operator , which does not contain orbital variables .",
    "this means that the non - vanishing 1b gt matrix element ( for the @xmath2 process ) is due to either minor components of the wavefunctions or higher order corrections of the gt operators .",
    "since these are all quite small , the 1b matrix element becomes comparable to multi - body corrections , e.g. , meson - exchange - current ( mec ) contributions .",
    "a further complicating feature is that there is a substantial cancellation between the 1b and two - body ( mec ) contributions , which can amplify the errors .",
    "finally , with the  chiral - filter mechanism \" rendered ineffective , at non - vanishing leading order of effective field theory ( see below ) , the many - body corrections contain short - ranged operators the strengths of which are not known _ a priori _ and hence difficult to control .    the objective of our present work is to make accurate effective field theory ( eft ) predictions on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes within a single framework . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the strategy that exploits the power of _ both _ snpa and heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , which is a well - studied low - energy eft . in this approach",
    ", eft enters in the calculation of relevant transition operators .",
    "we will calculate them up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( 3 ) ; all the operators that appear up to 3 will be considered . to obtain the corresponding nuclear matrix elements , we need highly accurate nuclear wave functions .",
    "although it is- at least in principle  possible to also derive nuclear wave functions to the appropriate order from hbchpt , we choose not to do so .",
    "instead , we use realistic wave functions obtained in the standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa ) .",
    "the potentials that generate such wave functions are supposed to contain high orders in the chiral counting , presumably much higher than what can be accounted for in the irreducible vertex for the current operators . for a review of snpa ,",
    "see ref .",
    "such an approach which is close in spirit to weinberg s original scheme  @xcite based on the chiral expansion of  irreducible terms \" has been found to have an amazing predictive power for the @xmath15 process  @xcite .",
    "the basic advantage of eft is that the snpa and hbchpt can be combined into a model - independent framework based on the first principle .",
    "a systematic expansion scheme of eft reveals that , for the gt transition for which the  chiral - filter mechanism \"  @xcite is rendered inoperative , the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) operators and the leading short - ranged operators have the same chiral order , and hence their contributions should be comparable .",
    "this nullifies the intuitive argument that the long - ranged ope contribution should dominate the mec corrections .",
    "the existing snpa calculation , however , lacks this leading short - ranged operator while containing instead some higher order short - ranged contributions .",
    "what our eft manages to do is to account for this short - ranged contribution in a way consistent with renormalization group invariance .",
    "this is a novel way of understanding the so - called  short - range correlation \" in snpa .",
    "we will see that this aspect indeed plays an essential role both for @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes .",
    "briefly , our approach to hbchpt is as follows .",
    "we take only pions and nucleons as pertinent degrees of freedom .",
    "all others have been integrated out , and their dynamical roles are embedded in the higher - order operators . in the scheme relevant to us , it suffices to focus on  irreducible graphs \" according to weinberg s classification  @xcite .",
    "graphs are classified by the chiral power index @xmath16 given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of nucleons involved in the process , @xmath19 the number of disconnected parts , and @xmath20 the number of loops . the chiral index , @xmath21 , of the @xmath22-th vertex is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the numbers of derivatives , external fields and nucleon lines belonging to the vertex .",
    "the feynman diagrams with a chiral index @xmath16 are suppressed by @xmath27 compared with the leading - order one - body gt operator , with @xmath28 standing for the typical three - momentum scale and/or the pion mass , and @xmath29 is the chiral scale . the physical amplitude is then expanded with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the lo and 2 contributions come from the well - known one - body currents ; the gt operator for the @xmath30-th isospin component reads ^a_1b = g_a _ l=1,2 , [ 1-body ] with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "corrections to the above 1b operators are due to mecs , which start at 3 . in our work",
    "we include _ all _ the contributions up to 3 .",
    "we emphasize in particular that , up to 3 , only two - body ( 2b ) currents enter , three - body currents appearing only from 4 ; thus there is no arbitrary truncation involved here .",
    "the 3 2b currents consist of the ope and contact - term ( ct ) parts , _ 2b^a = _ 2b^a ( ) + _ 2b^a ( ) . the ope part is given as",
    "_ 2b^a ( ) & = & - , where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , and similarly for @xmath35 . since the couplings @xmath36 are determined from the @xmath37 data  @xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ", there is no unknown parameter here . now",
    "the ct part is given as _",
    "2b^a ( ) = - , [ 2-body ] which contains two low - energy constants .",
    "however , the pauli principle ( or the `` @xmath40 '' rule ) combined with the fact that the ct term is effective only for @xmath41-wave ( @xmath42 ) implies that we need only work with one unknown constant , @xmath43 , defined by d_1 + 2 d_2 + 13 c_3 + 23 c_4 + 16 . [ dr ] furthermore , the same combination also enters into tritium @xmath44-decay , @xmath45-capture on deuteron , and @xmath16@xmath46 scattering .",
    "although @xmath43 is in principle calculable from qcd for a given scale @xmath47 , this calculation is not available at present ; we therefore need to fix @xmath43 empirically . here",
    "we choose to determine @xmath43 by fitting the tritium @xmath44-decay rate , @xmath48 , which is accurately known experimentally  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath43 is fixed , our calculation involves no unknown parameters .",
    "we calculate the matrix elements of the transition operators with state - of - the - art realistic nuclear wave functions for @xmath49 .",
    "we employ the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics ( chh ) wave functions , obtained with the argonne @xmath50 ( av18 ) potential ( supplemented with the urbana - ix three - nucleon potential for the @xmath51 nuclei ) .",
    "to control short - range physics in a consistent manner , we apply the same regularization method to all the nuclear systems in question .",
    "specifically , in performing fourier transformation to derive the @xmath52-space representation of transition operators , we use the gaussian regularization .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing the delta and yukawa functions with the regularized ones , @xmath53 where the cut - off function @xmath54 is defined as s_(q^2 ) = ( - ) .",
    "[ regulator ] the cutoff parameter @xmath47 characterizes the energy - momentum scale of our eft .",
    "the value of @xmath43 determined from the experimental value of @xmath48 is = ( 1.00 0.07 ,  1.78 0.08 ,  3.90 0.10 ) for the choice of @xmath55 mev , respectively .",
    "we list in table  [ table : pp ] the gt matrix elements for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes ( in arbitrary units ) as a function of @xmath47 .",
    ".[table : pp]gt matrix element for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes , calculated for representative values of @xmath47 .",
    "the 2b contribution is the sum of the ope part ( @xmath43-independent ) and the ct part ( linear in @xmath43 ) , for each case . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tabs ] shows the contribution to the @xmath0-factor from each initial channel , at zero c.m . energy . for comparison",
    "we have also listed the latest results based on snpa @xcite ( which we refer to as msvkrb ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that for all the channels other than @xmath56 , the @xmath47-dependence is very small ( @xmath57 % ) . while the gt terms are dominant , the contribution of the axial - charge term in the @xmath56 channel is sizable even though it is kinematically suppressed by the factor @xmath58 .",
    "the results given in table  [ tabs ] lead to a much improved estimate of the @xmath2 @xmath0-factor : s(hep)=(8.6 1.3 ) , [ prediction ] where the  error \" spans the range of the @xmath47-dependence for @xmath47 = 500800 mev .",
    "this result is to be compared to that obtained by msvkrb  @xcite , @xmath59 . to decrease the uncertainty in eq.([prediction ] ) , we need to reduce the @xmath47-dependence in the two - body gt term .",
    "according to a general _ tenet _ of eft , the @xmath47-dependence should diminish when higher order terms are included .",
    "a preliminary study indicates that it is indeed possible to reduce the @xmath47-dependence significantly by including 4 corrections .",
    "by determining the only parameter of the theory @xmath43 from the experimental data on triton beta decay , we have succeeded in making rather accurate eft predictions ( up to 3 ) in a parameter - free manner for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes .",
    "these predictions turn out to give support to the latest snpa results .",
    "the prediction for the @xmath1 prediction comes out to be independent of the cutoff scale @xmath47 , which means that it is fully consistent with the tenet of eft . on the other hand ,",
    "there remains some @xmath47-dependence for the @xmath2 process , which could be due to many - body nature absent in the @xmath1 case .",
    "even so , it is remarkable that the theoretical uncertainty can be reduced from `` orders of magnitude '' to @xmath60 % .",
    "this uncertainty can be further reduced if 4 terms  which involve no additional unknowns  are taken into account .",
    "we should note that by using the  exact \" wave functions , we are sacrificing the strict adherence to chiral order counting in favor of predictivity .",
    "the counting error committed therein comes at one order higher than that accounted for in the irreducible vertex for the current , i.e. , at 4 in the present calculation , and should be small for the whole scheme to make sense .",
    "this can be checked by an 4 calculation for which the counting error would come at 5 or higher . furthermore",
    "the notion implicit in our approach that the 1b matrix element calculated with the  exact \" wave functions should be taken as ",
    "empirical \" could be checked by looking at the @xmath61 process @xmath62 in which the 1b matrix element is expected to suffer the same suppression due to the symmetry properties of the initial and final states .",
    "it seems likely that an eft calculation of the @xmath2 process that adheres to the strict power counting  such as the pionless theory  @xcite  would be obstructed by a plethora of unknown parameters that are difficult to completely control .",
    "if such a calculation is feasible , however , it would be interesting to see if and how the symmetry suppression and the sensitive cancellation encountered in our version of eft  where an accurate 1b matrix element plays a key role  could either be circumvented or manifest themselves in the description .",
