    "_ black holes _ are one of the most celebrated predictions of general relativity and as such their stability properties are of fundamental importance . the first step in resolving",
    "the non - linear stability problem for black holes is to establish quantitative decay estimates for the wave equation @xmath0 on fixed black hole backgrounds .",
    "one of the main difficulties in the analysis of the wave equation on such backgrounds is the so - called _ trapping effect _ due to the existence of a family of _ trapped null geodesics _ in the domain of outer communications whose limit point is the future timelike infinity . in the well - known _",
    "kerr  newman _ family of black holes ,",
    "there is a family of trapped null geodesics with constant area radius @xmath1 . in the special subfamily of schwarzschild backgrounds these trapped null geodesics span the hypersurface @xmath2 known as the _ photon sphere_. here @xmath3 is the mass parameter . from every other point in the schwarzschild exterior region",
    "there is a codimension - one subset of future - directed null directions whose corresponding geodesics approach the photon sphere , and all other null geodesics either cross the event horizon @xmath4 or terminate at null infinity .",
    "the trapped null geodesics pose a well - known _ high - frequency obstruction _ , known as _ the trapping effect _ , for the existence of a _ non - degenerate morawetz estimate _ for the wave equation of the form @xmath5 where the trapped null geodesics exist in the region @xmath6 .",
    "the obstruction for originates from the existence of high - frequency solutions to the wave equation with finite initial energy which are supported in a neighborhood of trapped null geodesics for arbitrarily long times .",
    "this phenomenon has long been studied in the context of the obstacle problem for the wave equation in minkowski space , where the analogue of trapped null geodesics are null lines which reflect off the obstacle s boundary .",
    "recently , sbierski @xcite , building on previous work of ralston @xcite on the gaussian beam approximation , showed that , on general lorentzian manifolds , the energy at time @xmath7 of the localized high frequency solutions is comparable to the energy of the underlying null geodesic at time @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that the energy of the trapped null geodesics in the kerr ",
    "newman family is constant immediately contradicts estimate . on the other hand ,",
    "it can be shown ( see , for instance , @xcite and references there - in ) that on sub - extremal backgrounds estimate holds if the right hand side loses derivatives ( i.e  includes higher order energies ) .    having introduced the trapping effect on the photon sphere we next consider the event horizon .",
    "the event horizon is a null hypersurface ruled by null geodesics , known as the _",
    "null generators_. in the _ sub - extremal _ case , however , one can show a local integrated decay morawetz estimate in a neighborhood of the event horizon without any loss of differentiation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is possible because the energy of the null generators _ decays exponentially _ in time @xmath7 , in view of the of the so - called _ redshift effect _ which in turn is based on the positivity of the _ surface gravity _",
    "( see section [ background ] for an introduction to these notions ) .",
    "hence , no trapping takes place on the event horizon of sub - extremal black holes , even though the latter is ruled by null geodesics .",
    "nonethelesss , the situation is drastically different for _ degenerate horizons _ , which are null hypersurfaces with vanishing surface gravity .",
    "this is the case for the event horizon of _ extremal _ black holes . in this case",
    "the null generators have energy that is constant in time .",
    "hence , sbierski s result implies that loss of regularity is a _ necessary _ condition for the existence of a non - degenerate morawetz estimate up to and including the event horizon .",

    "we remark that these stability and instability results do * not * suffice to determine whether a non - degenerate morawetz estimate up to and including the event horizon holds for general smooth solutions to the wave equation on extremal black holes ( see section [ sec : previousworks ] for more details ) .      in this paper",

    "we use a special structure of the geometry of degenerate horizons to show that all the resulting singular terms can be estimated by singular norms of the initial data .",
    "the boundedness of these singular norms ( which is an assumption on the initial data only ) implies a non - degenerate morawetz estimate .",

    "in section [ sec : discussion ] it is shown that in the sub - extremal case the corresponding limit is infinite demonstrating thus a new distinctive feature of degenerate horizons .",
    "for the projection @xmath11 , we use the vector field @xmath15 as a a _ commutator _ vector field ( see section [ flux ] ) and the _ degenerate _ vector field @xmath25 as multiplier vector field .",
    "our estimates follow by appropriate use of hardy and poincar inequalities and the special structure of the wave equation in a neighborhood of the degenerate event horizon which yield various cancellations of the most dangerous terms .",
    "it is worth contrasting this with the trapping estimate at the photon sphere where one is required to commute with either the killing field @xmath21 or the standard killing fields @xmath26 of the sphere .",
