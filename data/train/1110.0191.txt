    "we will present here the most salient facts and results concerning the ( non - directional ) hunt for weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) , most often presented within the framework of minimal supesymetric models ( mssm ) which offers a well suited candidate ( the neutralino as a heavy , stable particle ) , and more pragmatically , a benchmark for experiments sensitivity comparison .",
    "the candidate to be detected has the following basic properties : it should be neutral , quite heavy ( o(100gev ) ) , and interacts very weakly with `` ordinary '' matter . from an experimental point of view",
    ", this in turns set the main constraints for an experiment design , namely a  kev to 10 kev energy threshold , and a small background counting rate ( less than 0.01 event / kg / day from latest experimental constraints ) .",
    "these two constraints call for some massive ( o(1 kg ) or more ) and sensitive detectors , the main difficulty already arising being the opposition between mass and sensitivity for most of the detection methods . given the expected counting rates , one has to expose detectors to the predicted wimps background during long period ( o(1 year ) ) , which requires good long term stability by regular calibrations and/or a precise control over several environmental parameters . among these environmental parameters ,",
    "one of the most important is of course the particles background at these energies , from ambient radioactivity and from the influence of cosmic rays . the latter problem is partly adressed by installing experiment in underground laboratory and using passive shielding , the former by carefully controlling the radiopurity of the experiment ans its vicinity .",
    "one important features with respect to neutral particles search is the ability of adding an active rejection method for ionizing particles in addition to the passive shielding . after presenting the main facts about background discrimination and possible observational signatures",
    ", we will detail major results concerning spin - independent coupling between wimps and target nuclei , followed by major results concerning the spin - dependent case .",
    "we finally sum up some observations and results about the recent `` low mass '' ( o(1gev ) ) hints that some experiments have observed .",
    "as pictured in figure [ detection_channels ] , the energy deposited by an incoming particles inside an absorber may be measured under three main forms : heat , scintillation or ionisation .",
    "the pertinency of using one or several of these three channel obviously depend on the absorber type .",
    "bolometry allows heat measurement , this channel giving the total thermalized energy of all channels when observed on a sufficiently long time - scale ( i.e the time - scale for thermalization ) .",
    "this channel will thus be measuring nearly all the energy deposited . as an exception to that ,",
    "if scintillation processes take place in a transparent absorber , there is about 1@xmath0 or so of the deposited energy that will not be thermalized and will be lost for the heat channel .",
    "the scintillation photons may then be detected by a separate photodetector .",
    "scintillation is closely linked to excitation of electronic states and to the following photons emission .",
    "its intensity may be dependent on the spatial density of the deposited energy , thus on stopping power and on energy on the incident particle .",
    "finally , part of the energy deposited may be absorbed in atom ionisations ( typically 10@xmath0 or so ) . in a semiconductor absorber , an energy greater than the effective energy gap beetwen valence and conduction bands will lead to the generation of electron - hole pairs that can be collected by biased electrodes and measured through associated charge read - out . for the first generation of direct dark matter detection , e.g. igex , the theoretical expectations on wimps cross - section was sufficiently loose so that a single channel measurement , without any identification of ionizing background , was sufficient to improve existing constraints .",
    "a second generation , e.g. cdms , cresst , edelweiss or xenon , began to use an event - by - event discrimination based on the simultaneous measurement of two channels .",
    "the ratio of energies deposited in each channel can then serve as a powerful discriminator between ionizing ( background from so - called electron recoils ) and non - ionizing ( wimps candidates from so - called nuclear recoils ) particles . cdms and edelweiss both use simultaneous measurement of heat and ionisation in low - temperature ge absorbers .",
    "cresst uses simultaneous measurement of heat and scintillation in low temperature c@xmath1wo@xmath2 , while xenon uses ionisation and scintillation detection in two phases liquid / gas xenon tank . on the other hand ,",
    "some experiments ( e.g. dama or cogent ) took different design choices . while they use single channel measurement , preventing them to get some precious informations about ionizing background , they are able to build simpler setups , which in turn may allow to have bigger mass and/or better features like improved energy resolution by loosening technical constraints . depending on these design choices",
    ", an experiment will be able to sign a candidate detection from one or several signatures .",
    "spin - dependent interactions rate is related to the nuclear spin of target nuclei . concerning neutron coupling ,",
    "the best constraints are set by experiments that are also competitive in the spin - dependent search ( like e.g. xenon or cdms , see figure [ spin_dependent_exclusions ] , right panel ) .",
    "concerning proton coupling , direct detection methods are still far from constraining the most optimistic projections of mssm models ( see figure [ spin_dependent_exclusions ] , left panel ) .",
    "indirect methods still put the best constraints , like kamiokande study of solar neutrino production .",
    "there are nevertheless some interesting direct detection methods that could have the ability or reaching a comparable or better level of sensitivity .",
    "there are indeed at least four different technologies ahead for continuing the search : scintillation ( kims ) , bubble chamber ( coupp ) and super heated droplets ( picasso ) .",
    "these two lasts are using metastable states for detection .",
    "we will here focus on coupp , showing encouraging results and giving a nice example of features allowed by such metastable detectors , not pictured in the general scheme given in figure [ detection_channels ] .",
    "coupp is using one of the oldest method from accelerator physics , namely bubble chamber .",
    "latest results have been obtained on a 3.5 kg mass of liquid cf@xmath3i kept in a metastable state by controlling pressure .",
    "a nuclear recoil type energy deposit will locally create a bubble that can expand until full boiling of the vessel on a 100 ms time scale .",
    "one of the most impressive features of this method is its built - in capacity to reject ionising background .",
    "the bubble nucleation process is indeed almost unsensitive to electron recoils , allowing to reach a record immunity to ionising background of the order of 10@xmath4 ( one ionising event over 10@xmath4 may not be rejected , where as best other experiments are at the 10@xmath5 level ) .",
    "the setup is operated at room temperature .",
    "the trigger and event positioning features are realized through the use of 2 ccd cameras monitoring the appearance of bubbles in the vessel .",
    "a particular care has to be taken with respect to the surface quality of the containing vessel , irregularities on this surface being a source of background nucleation rate .",
    "the event monitoring is completed by acoustic piezo - electric transducers .",
    "the most currently limiting background is coming from alpha emission , some possibilities of using ultrasonic emission structures to discriminate this being under study by the picasso@xcite and coupp experiments .",
    "neutron background is claimed to be efficiently rejected by monitoring multiple deposits ( several bubbles seen on ccds ) , given the high multiple interactions probability of an incoming neutron .",
    "latest results@xcite gave the best constraints on proton coupling for direct methods , thanks to a 4 months run that has resulted in a final 28.1 kg.days exposure ( 42@xmath0 quality cuts due to intermittent noise on the acoustic channel ) .",
    "3 nuclear recoils candidates have been observed during this run , and a next phase with a total 60 kg bubble chamber is expected to start in 2012 .      back to a decade",
    "ago , the claim from dama of detecting an annual modulation of events seens in there nai scintillation detectors have been widely ctiticized , their results being incompatible with results from other experiments , at least in the `` standard '' mssm framework .",
    "since then , this modulation has been confirmed by the dama / libra experiment on several years with a correct phase and a high statistical significance@xcite .",
    "this of course rose the question of possible long term systematic effects linked to seasonnal variations of some environmental parameter .",
    "the latter concern is all the more important that the detection has been made in the very first energy bins above threshold , the stability of this threshold being one of the most obvious questions to be adressed .",
    "the latest results from the cogent experiment@xcite , claiming an excess event rate at low energy with respect to a background model and also a possible annual modulation of this excess ( a claim recently fragilised by the declaration of a bias due to data cuts at the taup2011 conference ) , triggered an additional interest .",
    "the claimed modulations fall in the same region of the mssm phase space corresponding to so - called `` low - mass '' candidates with a mass of the order of 10 gev , well below previous constraints set by accelerator physics .",
    "as already stated , one could note that both experiments are not using any discrimination of ionising background , the possibility of explaining the modulation in terms of modulated background is thus opened .",
    "nevertheless , a still more recent result from cresst@xcite gave a new intriguing hint about that .",
    "this experiment does use ionising background discrimination thanks to the simultaneous measurement of heat and scintillation in c@xmath6wo@xmath7 absorbers .",
    "the presence of 3 different target nuclei , together with some careful calibrations of their respective light yiels , allow to get some additional statistical informations on nuclear recoils .",
    "the three nuclear recoils have indeed different characteristic scintillation - over - heat ratio for nuclear recoils , and are sensitive to different ranges of wimp masses .",
    "their latest results show a significant detection of about 30 nuclear recoils events that are also compatible with a low mass wimp candidate .",
    "some questions stays open about a possible contaminations from alphas events , although the background estimations made so far are well below the observed rate . despite of these converging results ,",
    "a strong tension still exist with other experiments , xenon@xcite claiming to reject the whole mssm phase - space zone correponding to the detected candidates ( let apart a controversy about low energy calibrations in xenon ) , cdms@xcite rejecting almost all this zone too , and edelweiss@xcite confirming the rejection for the major part .",
