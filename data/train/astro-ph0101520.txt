    "the last decade has witnessed the explosive growth of high - quality data on type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) both from the ground and from space with spectacular results and new perspectives .",
    "one of the main advances was the confirmation of the long suspected correlation between the peak brightness and the decline rate ( phillips , 1993 ) which clearly established that sne  ia span a wide range in brightness but , nevertheless , most are found in a narrow range of brightness ( branch & tammann 1992 ) .",
    "this established sne  ia as a tool for accurate distance determinations on cosmological scales .",
    "sne  ia have provided new estimates for the value of the hubble constant ( h@xmath7 ) based on a purely empirical procedure ( hamuy et al . 1996ab ; riess et al .",
    "1996 ) and on a comparison of detailed theoretical models with observations ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 , hereafter hk96 ; nugent et al .",
    "the values obtained ( @xmath10 ) are in good agreement with one another and with those from the hst key project on the hubble constant based on cepheid distances . more recently , routinely successful detections of supernovae at large redshifts ( perlmutter et al . 1997 , 1999 ; schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ; riess et al .",
    "1999 ) have provided a new tool to measure cosmological parameters such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 . this has led to refined estimates of h@xmath7 , indicated that we live in a low matter - density universe , and , most intriguing of all , gives hints that the cosmological constant is not zero .",
    "although details of the explosion are still under discussion , there is general agreement that sne  ia result from some process of combustion of a degenerate white dwarf ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) . within this general picture ,",
    "three classes of models have been considered : ( 1 ) explosion of a co white dwarf ( wd ) , with mass close to the chandrasekhar mass , which accretes mass through roche - lobe overflow from an evolved companion star ( nomoto & sugimoto 1977 ) ; ( 2 ) explosion of a rotating configuration formed from the merging of two low - mass wds , caused by the loss of angular momentum due to gravitational radiation ( webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ; paczyski 1985 ) ; and ( 3 ) explosion of a low mass co - wd triggered by the detonation of an outer helium layer ( nomoto 1980 ; woosley & weaver 1986 ; hk96 ) . only the first two scenarios seem to be in agreement with current observations .",
    "delayed - detonation models ( khokhlov 1991 ; yamaoka et al .",
    "1992 ; woosley & weaver 1994 ) of chandrasekhar mass co - wds and their variations can account for the spectral and light curve evolution of  normally bright \" and subluminous sne  ia in the optical and ir ( hflich 1995a ; hflich et al .",
    "1995a , hereafter hkw95 ; wheeler et al . 1998 ; lenz et al .",
    "1999 ; hflich et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this model ,",
    "a burning front starts as a subsonic deflagration and then undergoes a transition to a supersonic detonation .",
    "pure deflagration models like w7 ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) can also account for optical spectra of normal supernovae ( e.g. nugent et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the merging scenario remains an interesting alternative which to a great extent has only been parameterized in theoretical studies but may produce results in agreement with some supernovae ( hk96 ) .",
    "the sub - chandrasekhar model triggered by edge - lit helium ignition is disfavored on the basis of predicted light curves and spectra ( hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; nugent et al .",
    "1997 ) .    despite the success of analyses of light curves and spectra",
    ", these traditional methods do not provide any direct information on the geometrical structure of the envelope .",
    "polarization does provide information about the geometry in the scattering - dominated atmospheres of supernovae ( van den hulst 1957 ; chandrasekhar 1960 ; shapiro & sutherland 1982 ; hflich 1991 , hereafter h91 ; jeffery 1991 , hereafter j91 ) .",
    "this is because electron scattering causes the electric field vectors of scattered photons to take on a preferential orientation . for an unresolved spherical scattering atmosphere ,",
    "the electric vectors cancel , yielding zero net polarization ; however , in an aspherical sn , there will be increased scattering from the wings which produces electric field vectors that are not completely cancelled by scattering from the rest of the disk of the sn . in this case",
    "the observer would measure a net polarization .",
    "polarization can thus provide unique information on the geometry of sne  ia that will give essential hints to understand the physics of thermonuclear explosions and the progenitor systems . though historically the vast majority of computational models have assumed spherical symmetry , for some of the scenarios we may expect strong deviations from spherical geometry .",
    "for instance , the deflagration front has been found to be highly aspherical due to large rising plumes ( khokhlov 1995 , 2000 ; niemeyer & hillebrandt 1995 ) .",
    "for delayed detonations , the transition of the deflagration front into a detonation may occur at a point rather than in a shell ( livne 1999 ) .",
    "the coalescence of two white dwarfs or an otherwise rapidly rotating progenitor could also produce an overall , global asphericity .",
    "deviations from sphericity may result in a direction dependence of the emitted flux , and consequently may affect the use of sne  ia as distance indicators .    in this work , we report polarization measurement and interpretation of the subluminous sn 1999by .",
    "the observations are presented in  2 and the results in  3 . in ",
    "4 we describe an empirical method to analyse the data and to derive the interstellar polarization . in  5 , theoretical models for delayed detonations are used to analyze the observations .",
    "we close in  6 with a discussion of the results for sn 1999by , put our findings into context with other sne  ia and different explosion scenarios , and discuss the implications for the use of sne  ia as standard candles .",
    "all observations were taken with the dual beam imaging grism polarimeter ( igp ) at the cassegrain focus of the mcdonald observatory 2.1 m telescope .",
    "igp is the imaging grism instrument ( igi ) combined with spectropolarimetry optics ( goodrich 1991 ) .",
    "igi is a simple focal reducer with a grism that can be moved into the collimated beam .",
    "off - the - shelf optics are used which have been anti - reflection coated for @xmath13   .",
    "polarization capability is provided by a modified glan - taylor polarizing beam splitter and a rotatable waveplate .",
    "the glan - taylor prism is made up of two calcite blocks .",
    "the ordinary ray ( o - ray ) is totally internally reflected , while the extraordinary ray ( e - ray ) passes through , due to different indices of refraction .",
    "the waveplate acts as a halfwave retarder and rotates the plane of polarization of incoming light .",
    "the halfwave plate is `` superachromatic '' with a retardance of 180  @xmath14 2  from 3200   to 11000  .",
    "the intrinsic polarization of igp has been previously determined to be low , @xmath15 , see wang , wheeler , &  ( 1997a ; hereafter wwh97 ) and wang et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "this was confirmed with the observation of null polarization standards .",
    "more extensive information about the data reduction techniques , standard stars , and observational setup is available in howell ( 2000a ) .",
    "a 2.1  slit was used with the 6000   grism , giving a resolution of about 14  . for all observations ,",
    "the 85 mm lens was used in conjunction with the tk4 @xmath16 ccd , yielding a plate scale of 0.5  ( @xmath17 3.9  ) per pixel .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated with an argon lamp .",
    "polarization standards were observed at least once per night . the observing log is shown in table [ log99by ] .",
    "the data were reduced in iraf , using tasks written by the authors .",
    "the reduction methods followed were those presented in miller   ( 1988 ) , trammell ( 1994 ) , and howell ( 2000a ) .",
    "for sn 1999by , two sets of data were taken each night with each `` set '' consisting of four 2030 minute integrations at waveplate position angles of 0 , 45 , 22.5 , and 67.5 degrees .",
    "polarization and flux standards were observed each night . since spectropolarimetry measurements require a high signal - to - noise , the sn",
    "was observed over the course of three nights , and the data were combined .",
    "the data presented here have been corrected for redshift , though this correction is negligible ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "sn 1999by was discovered independently by r. arbour , south wonston , hampshire , england ( arbour  1999 ) , and by the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; cf .",
    "treffers  1997 , li  1999 ) .",
    "the sn was found on the outskirts ( 100  west and 91  north of the nucleus ) of the well - known sb galaxy ngc 2841 . according to the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned )",
    "the host galaxy is a liner and has a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath19 .",
    "according to the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , the velocity corrected for virgo infall is 811 . using @xmath20 ,",
    "this puts the distance to ngc 2841 at 12.49 mpc , with a distance modulus of 30.48 mag .",
    "this prodigious galaxy has also produced sn 1912a ( type uncertain ) and the `` peculiar type i s '' sn 1957a and sn 1972r .    according to bonanos  ( 1999 ) ,",
    "sn 1999by reached a maximum light of @xmath21 on ut 1999 may 10.5 , and a maximum in the @xmath22 band of @xmath23 ( date not given ) . according to weidong li ( private communication ) the maxima were may 10.3 ( @xmath24 ) and may 12.3 ( @xmath22 ) . using a distance modulus of 30.48 , and the photometry of bonanos ,",
    "the absolute magnitudes at peak are @xmath25 and @xmath26 . thus sn 1999by is underluminous by roughly 2.5 magnitudes compared to a typical sn  ia .",
    "sn  1999by also had a large @xmath27 of 1.87 .",
    "this makes sn  1999by nearly as steeply declining as sn  1991bg , which had @xmath28 .",
    "sn  1999by is thus one of the most underluminous and rapidly declining sne  ia known .",
    "sn  1999by is similar to sn  1991bg in other respects as well . the  line at 5800   is strong relative to the line at 6150  , another signature of the subluminous subclass . according to bonanos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the flux near 4000   was depressed as in other subluminous sne  ia , a feature thought to be due to  absorption .",
    "the  feature at 7500   is also strong in both sn  1991bg and sn  1999by .",
    "flux spectra of sn 1999by can be seen in figure [ flux ] .",
    "maximum light in @xmath24 occurred on may 10 , therefore the spectra shown are two days before , one day before , and at maximum light .",
    "several features are apparent upon inspection figure [ flux ] .",
    "most obvious is the fact that sn  1999by is unquestionably a subluminous sn  ia .",
    "it is similar to the prototype , sn  1991bg .",
    "beginning at the blue side of the spectrum , we see that the spectrum starts near 4300   in a huge absorption feature .",
    "this is thought to be due to , a feature only observed in subluminous events ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter f92 ) .",
    "the fact that this ionization state of ti is seen indicates a relatively low temperature in the ejecta , since  is ionized in typical sne  ia ( nugent et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter n95 ) .  is also responsible for absorption features in the 45005000    region ( f92 ) . moving redward , another signature of subluminous events",
    "is seen in the pair of  lines on either side of 5400  .",
    "as one moves down the sequence from overluminous to subluminous sne , the blue line is overtaken in strength by the red one ( n95 ) . here",
    "the bluer line is scarcely seen at all , consistent with our finding that sn 1999by is a very subluminous sn ia . from the blueshift of the absorption features of si",
    ", one can measure an approximate velocity of this element ( and thus its placement in the ejecta , since @xmath29 ) . for sn 1999by",
    "we measure @xmath30 , comparable to speeds of @xmath31 and @xmath32  reported for sn 1991bg by f92 and leibundgut  ( 1993 ) , respectively .",
    "this is slightly lower than the average si velocity in a normally bright sn  ia , @xmath33 to @xmath34 , though velocities derived from absorption minima of broad doublets as seen in the  6150    feature are only accurate to @xmath17 1000 .    on the far red end of the spectrum ,",
    "the absorption at 7500   is yet another hallmark of subluminosity .",
    "this line is due largely to a blend of  @xmath357774 and on the red wing , separated here by narrow atmospheric absorption .",
    "this feature is not seen in the luminous sn 1991 t , but increases in strength as one goes down the luminosity sequence to subluminous sne  ia ( n95 ) .",
    "this  feature is also absent in sn 1998de , a fast - declining sn ia that was peculiar in several ways ( modjaz  2000 ) .",
    "the dominant sources of opacity in an sn ia , line scattering and electron scattering , can both change the polarization of incident flux .",
    "electron scattering polarization is independent of wavelength . in the case of axisymmetric scattering ,",
    "the polarization position angle can take on only one of two values : 0  or 90  with respect to the symmetry axis ( see  cropper  1988 ; j91 , h91 ) . line scattering need not lead to complete angular redistribution . the degree to which line scattering can polarize depends on the lower- and upper - level total angular momenta of that line ( j91 ) .",
    "despite the fact that lines can polarize , most line scattering is less polarizing than electron scattering by an order of magnitude . as a result , electrons are the chief polarization mechanism , while the lines generally depolarize the flux previously polarized by electron scattering .",
    "lines can redirect photons by decay in the same transition , but they can also redistribute photons to both higher and lower frequencies by further excitation or ionization from the level at which the photon is absorbed or by decay into multiple discrete lower levels ( j91 , hflich 1995a ) .",
    "dust can polarize by scattering through dichroic extinction and through emission of polarized photons .",
    "dust scattering is usually wavelength dependent , though the results vary with scattering angle . for dust typical of the ism ,",
    "the polarized flux of optical photons undergoing a single scattering can decrease with wavelength for small scattering angles , increase with wavelength for large scattering angles , or remain constant for @xmath36 ( white 1979 ; webb et al . 1993 ) .",
    "nonspherical dust grains with aligned rotation axes ( from , e.g. a magnetic field ) can be a source of polarization through dichroic extinction . in this case",
    ", the polarization position vector is perpendicular to the grain alignment vector .",
    "table 2 gives all the sne  ia for which some polarization data are available .",
    "figure [ quftotrc ] shows the normalized stokes parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 and the flux spectrum of sn  1999by .",
    "the dashed line is the unsmoothed data .",
    "a darker colored line on the @xmath37 and @xmath38 plots shows the data smoothed with a running boxcar smoothing function of 17 pixels ( 65  ) .",
    "features from 48005100   are blue , from 51005270   light blue .",
    "the  features from 5270 to 5600 are green .",
    "the  features are marked by two different colors .",
    "the 5800   feature is yellow , while the 6150   line is magenta .",
    "black represents the area between the si features and the area slightly redward .",
    "finally , the large , broad polarization feature to the red of 6500   is colored red .    in figure [ tsstot ] we present @xmath39 for the unsmoothed data , but we note that this indicator is biased high for low signal to noise data . therefore , we generate the smoothed version , @xmath40 ( dark solid line ) from the smoothed @xmath37 and @xmath38 values . in other words , @xmath41}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath42 denotes smoothed values .",
    "similarly , the smoothed polarization position angle is : @xmath43}\\ ] ] in addition to @xmath1 , figure [ tsstot ] also shows @xmath44 and the associated errors @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ qutotrc ] shows the smoothed values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the  plane for sn  1999by .",
    "the colors are identical to the color scheme used in figure [ quftotrc ] .",
    "in such a plot , each point defines a vector from the origin .",
    "the length of this vector is @xmath40 and the orientation is @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ qutotrc ] and its implications are discussed further in  [ qudiscussion ] .    as is often the case in spectropolarimetry measurements , the data for any single set of observations has a low signal to noise .",
    "thus we have combined the data for all three nights to produce figures [ quftotrc ] and [ tsstot ] .",
    "these figure show the sum of all observations , and consequently have the best signal to noise , with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "note that despite this low formal statistical error , systematic errors prevent us from actually discriminating small scale changes in @xmath40 of order 0.05 to 0.1% .",
    "we use this `` lowest noise '' case for most subsequent analysis , but we also look to the individual data sets for confirmation that features are real .",
    "figure [ 4p ] shows the results of combining the data in different ways .",
    "the top panel shows @xmath1 derived from all observations .",
    "the second panel shows @xmath1 constructed from only the best four data sets .",
    "the third panel shows @xmath1 from the best single data set , taken on may 10 when the supernova was at maximum light .",
    "finally , the lower panel of figure [ 4p ] shows the sum of the best data from may 8 and 9 combined with the second best data set from may 10 .",
    "these are the next three best data sets after the best set from may 10 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ 4p ] are 1 @xmath50 errors .",
    "our indicator @xmath40 falls beneath the midpoint of the unsmoothed data because @xmath1 is biased high as an indicator , though @xmath40 is less biased .",
    "the degree of the bias to @xmath1 increases with low signal to noise data .",
    "we also tested wang s indicator , ( wwh97 ) and the rotated stokes parameter (  tran 1995 ) , and both agree with @xmath40 to within 0.02% across all wavelengths .",
    "it is important to remember that there is no perfect indicator for the total degree of polarization ( leonard  2000b ; simmons & stewart 1985 ) .",
    "three features stand out in every data set .",
    "these are : the overall level of @xmath51 , the change in @xmath44 across the 6150   feature , and the rise in @xmath1 to 0.6% at 6900  .",
    "we discuss each in turn .    * the level of @xmath1 : * the first of these significant features is that throughout most of the spectrum @xmath51 , with some excursions to lower values .",
    "not every bump in the smoothed data in figure [ 4p ] is significant because smoothing can introduce artifacts into low signal to noise data ; however , the overall level of @xmath52 shown in figure [ tsstot ] is significant .",
    "the statistical error for @xmath1 is @xmath53 in the region of interest , and the statistical error for the smoothed spectrum is @xmath54 .",
    "we should also keep in mind that the fact that we have smoothed the data means that we can not distinguish features narrower than 65  .    *  6150  : * an overall level of polarization is interesting , but could be caused by interstellar or circumstellar sources .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of the spectropolarimetry of sn 1999by is then the change in position angle , @xmath44 , of the polarization through the  6150   feature as seen in figure [ tsstot ] .",
    "the pa jumps from 100  to 150  over this region , peaking at 6200  . as shown in the second panel of figure [ tsstot ] , @xmath55   without smoothing . after smoothing , @xmath56 .",
    "_ even without smoothing , the change in @xmath44 across si is a 4@xmath50 result .",
    "_ this is clear evidence that the sn is intrinsically polarized .",
    "it is also remarkable that the polarization change in si is roughly equal to the polarization change across the entire wavelength region . at 4800",
    "  @xmath57  but , by 7100  @xmath44 has dropped to @xmath58  .",
    "this is significant because we will later show that there is a single choice of interstellar polarization that , when subtracted from the data , reduces the position angle across all wavelengths to nearly a single value .",
    "* the 6900   rise : * the rise in polarization toward the red peaks at @xmath59 at 6900  .",
    "this feature is wider ( 1000  ) than any particular line , and it occurs in a region normally blanketed by fe - peak lines . such a rise in polarization in this wavelength region was predicted theoretically by wwh97 .",
    "we will revisit this feature when we discuss the theoretical interpretation of the data in  [ theory ] .",
    "the  plane is a powerful tool for interpreting sn polarimetry data both with respect to testing the overall geometry and to determining the interstellar component of the polarization .",
    "the  plot for the smoothed data of sn 1999by is given in figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "each point corresponds to one pixel .",
    "the points are color coded to reflect their distribution in wavelength .",
    "the color coding is from figure [ quftotrc ] which shows the smoothed @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and flux spectra .",
    "polarization arising from axisymmetric scattering will show up as a straight line on the  plot ( see  cropper  1988 ; j91 ) .",
    "uncorrected for interstellar polarization , the data for sn 1999by clearly define an axis of symmetry in figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "the scatter is @xmath60 , comparable to the scatter expected from photon statistics and systematic effects .",
    "the distribution of the  6150   feature is particularly interesting , as noted in the previous section . here",
    "the si feature is colored magenta .",
    "it was previously noted that the variation in position angle across the si feature matches the variation in position angle seen across the entire wavelength region of study .",
    "stated another way ,  is not localized to one spot on the  diagram , but is distributed throughout the `` line '' demarked by the rest of the points in the plot , except the points from the 6900   region , which are colored red . physically , this means that si does not have a special geometry  it shares the same axis of symmetry as the rest of the sn .",
    "there is a slight deviation from linearity in the red points on figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "if we take this jog to be real , noting that it is nearly perpendicular to the rest of the points , then the jog corresponds to a switching from an oblate to a prolate geometry in the corresponding wavelength region or vice versa .",
    "this seems to be an unnecessary complication of the model .",
    "the discrepant points can be explained by noise .",
    "if a point deviates from the line by 3@xmath50 , smoothing can introduce correlated errors , causing several neighboring points to appear to deviate from the line as well . on the basis of these few points ,",
    "it is not possible to conclude that there are deviations from the global geometry in this wavelength region .",
    "interstellar polarization ( isp ) due to dust in the interstellar medium of both the host galaxy and the milky way can change the observed polarization spectrum of an object .",
    "the difficult question of how much of the polarization signature measured for sn 1999by is intrinsic and how much is interstellar plagues polarization measurements of all objects .",
    "the issue is particularly difficult in the case of extragalactic objects which can have two sources of isp  one contribution from our galaxy , and one from the host galaxy .",
    "fortunately , we can estimate the isp for sn  1999by via two essentially independent methods , the empirical  plane method and theoretical considerations .",
    "we will discuss these specific techniques below , but in this section we provide general constraints on interstellar polarization .    the maximum interstellar polarization allowable , corresponding to the most favorable alignment of dust grains along the line of sight is @xmath61 ( serkowski , mathewson & ford 1975 ) .",
    "the galactic longitude of sn 1999by is 166.91  and latitude 44.12  ( ned ) .",
    "the galactic extinction towards ngc 2841 is estimated to be @xmath62 mag ( schlegel  1998 ) though burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) give @xmath63 mag .",
    "schlegel  also estimate @xmath64 mag . using schlegel s estimate of @xmath64 mag ,",
    "the maximum galactic component of polarization is 0.144% .",
    "this is indicated by a dashed circle in the  plane diagram of figure  [ qutotrc ] .",
    "some limited information about the galactic component of isp can be gleaned from observations of stars near the line of sight to sn 1999by .",
    "there are only three stars with polarization measurements in the literature within @xmath65  of sn 1999by , and they are presented in table [ polstars - table ] .",
    "they are also plotted as light blue asterisks on the  plane , figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "the closest star to sn 1999by is hd 82328 .",
    "it is 2.16  away from the sn on the sky .",
    "while hd 82328 shows a low level of polarization , @xmath66 , it is also the closest star at 19 pc , so it does not sample much of the isp between us and the supernova .",
    "the next closest star , hd 82621 is 2.7  away with @xmath67 , but it is only 40 pc away . if we go out to hd 77770 , we can look through 1.3 kpc of the galaxy to see @xmath68 , but now we are looking @xmath69 away from the line of sight to the sn .",
    "this is probably the reason this star is outside the allowed galactic isp region of figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "the three stars also have different polarization position angles , and it is likely that any galactic polarization toward sn 1999by would have still a different position angle .",
    "in addition , if there is a contribution from isp in the spectrum of sn 1999by , it could arise from the host galaxy .",
    "these three stars alone do not allow us to place meaningful limits on the isp .",
    "fortunately , the  plane does suggest a choice of interstellar polarization .",
    "isp is a smoothly varying function of wavelength , described by the serkowski law : @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the percent polarization at wavelength @xmath35 , @xmath72 is the maximum polarization at wavelength @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath35 is in microns ; whittet  1992 ) .    to remove isp",
    ", we subtract a serkowski law from the data .",
    "this is essentially a vector subtraction in the  plane . correcting for interstellar polarization can either increase or decrease the derived intrinsic polarization of the object , and it can turn absorption features into emission features and vice versa",
    "this is easy to understand if we remember that we are `` undiluting '' the light from the sn by removing contaminating isp .",
    "mathematically , this is because the combination of the intrinsic polarization and isp is a vector addition .    to remove the interstellar signature from our data ,",
    "we must first determine @xmath75 .",
    "as remarked above , the data points fall on a line in the  plane of figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "we can assume for sne  ia that some parts of the spectra are depolarized ( wwh97 ) .",
    "taken together , this allows two possible choices of interstellar polarization ( see wang et al .",
    "if we place the isp at either end of the line delineated by the data points and subtract it , then the data will fall along a radial line in  space with essentially one constant value of @xmath44 for the system ( note that @xmath44 is one - half the angle of a vector on the  plane ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the isp point could be placed well within the spread of unsubtracted sn 1999by points . in this case , after subtraction the position angle would change abruptly where there was no particular feature in the polarization spectrum .",
    "we argue that this behavior is not likely to be physical .",
    "the two choices for isp are the light blue circles marked as a and b in figure [ qutotrc ] .",
    "the diameter of the circles corresponds to the approximate uncertainty in the placement of the isp .",

    ", this implies that some of the isp arose in the host galaxy . note that we could place the isp any place on the line defined by the data in the  plane that was not well within the spread of data points .",
    "the further the isp from the data , the more tightly , but arbitrarily , the isp position angle would be defined .",
    "we can not rule out more extreme choices , but argue that the isp is most plausibly at either a or b so that some portions of the data represent low polarization in the supernova .",

    "there is some deviation at longer wavelengths .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the isp - corrected points are relocated on the  plane , the long wavelength points are closest to the origin , and deviations in position angle are magnified .",
    "isp a is disfavored for three reasons : it produces a decrease in polarization at 7000  , it produces an increase in polarization in the  6150   feature , and it is less likely due to reddening considerations .",
    "we consider each in turn .",
    "subtracting isp a produces a high @xmath1 @xmath17 0.8% , at short wavelengths , and a decrease in polarization at wavelengths greater than 6500  .",
    "this is contrary to theoretical expectations .",
    "numerical calculations presented in wwh97 predicted a _ rise _ in polarization longward of 6500   due to decreased line blanketing .",
    "this is discussed in further detail below in  [ theory ] .",
    "the removal of isp a from the data also causes the polarization to be enhanced in the si 6150   feature .",
    "while this increase can not be ruled out completely , from a theoretical perspective , this feature is easier to understand if it is a depolarization .",
    "p - cygni lines are generated above the photosphere , so polarization produced by electron scattering at the photosphere is expected to be depolarized by absorption and reemission in the layers above it ( see the appendix ) .",
    "note that by using this qualitative theoretical prediction to discriminate between the two choices of isp , the `` empirical method '' is not completely independent of theory .",
    "however , the approach is significantly different from the determination of isp from a quantitative comparison to a specific theoretical model as done in  5 below .",
    "another consideration that slightly disfavors the choice of isp a is the observational constraint that the sn does not appear to be reddened .",
    "as mentioned above , the maximum interstellar polarization allowable , corresponding to the most favorable alignment of dust grains along the line of sight is @xmath61 .",

    "this is where line blanketing opacity dominates electron scattering opacity and thus is where depolarization is expected from theory ( hflich , mller & khokhlov 1993 , hereafter hmk93 ; wwh97 ) .",

    "currently , three - dimensional models are not a suitable tool to adjust parameters such as the main sequence mass , accretion rates , metallicity , rotation and combustion physics to find best fits .",
    "therefore , we restrict our discussion of the fluxes to the main spectral features .    in our model , the spectrum at day 15 is formed at the outer edge of the si - rich layers , i.e. well above the region containing 56  ( figure [ model1 ] ) .",
    "the top panel of figure [ model2 ] shows reasonable agreement between theoretical and observed features , and thus confirms the validity of this model in terms of doppler shifts of the lines , their strengths , the ionization stages , and the overall slope of the spectrum .",
    "most of the strong features can be attributed to the intermediate mass elements ,  and .",
    "most of the weaker lines are due to iron - group elements which are singly ionized as expected for subluminous sne  ia with a relatively cool photosphere ( hflich et al .",
    "the  feature at about 7450   is too weak in the models .",
    "this is not due to a lack of oxygen ( figure [ model1 ] ) , but the strength of the  line depends sensitively on the excitation .",
    "the discrepancy may be an artifact of the approximations imposed by the numerical treatment , or it may hint at the need for a slightly higher excitation in the outer layers ,  due to non - thermal electrons or an increased @xmath115-ray flux .",
    "we note that some fast - declining ( subluminous ) sne ia do not show strong  in their spectra ( modjaz  2000 ) .",
    "the flux spectrum depends on the inclination , @xmath116 ( here taken to be the angle between the equatorial plane and the line of sight ) . for oblate geometries ,",
    "the flux increases with @xmath116 because of the increased escape probability of photons towards polar directions ( h91 ) .",
    "although the asphericity is small in our example , the absolute flux varies by about 30% or @xmath117 from equator to pole . with increasing @xmath116 , weak absorption features ( e.g. due to , ) tend to be smeared out , and the overall spectrum becomes smoother as shown in the top panel of figure [ model2 ] .",
    "these absorption features are formed in a narrow region close to the origin of the quasi - continuum which is produced by electron scattering , bound - free processes , and by a large number of very weak lines ( hflich 1995a ) . because @xmath118 , for an oblate geometry the photosphere seen by an observer spans a wider velocity range as @xmath116 increases .",
    "in addition , the probability of multiple scattering of photons tangential to the photosphere into the  absorption \" feature increases with @xmath116 in the case of oblate geometries , thus diluting the depolarization of the line .",

    "we assume complete redistribution for lines which causes depolarization in lines . as expected both from analytical and numerical studies , the polarization @xmath121 ( e.g. van den hulst 1957 ; h91 ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of the polarization is governed by the absorption probability in lines relative to electron scattering .",
    "most prominent is the strong depolarization by the  line at 6150    and the ,  and si ii features at 7600    ( figure [ model2 ] , panel 2 ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "a large number of overlapping lines due to iron - group elements is responsible for the low polarization .",
    "the wavelength region above 5400    shows an increasing degree of polarization due to the decreasing importance of line opacities .",
    "shortwards of the  line at 6150  , the polarization level in the models is generally lower and shows modulations due to moderately strong , , and fe  ii lines , as expected from the opacity pattern for si - rich layers at temperatures between 5000 to 10000 k ( see figure 1 in hmk93 ) .",
    "we note that the frequency pattern of the model polarization spectra for subluminous supernovae is rather different from normally - bright sne  ia at the same phase ( e.g. sn 1996x , wwh97 ) . in the latter ,",
    "the polarization spectra near maximum light are dominated by iron - group elements because the photosphere is between 10,000 and 12,000 km  s@xmath109 ,  right at the interface between complete and incomplete si burning ( figure [ model1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the photospheric temperatures are higher than in subluminous events by several thousand degrees and , thus , iron - group elements are present both in the second and third ionization stage .",
    "the presence of these ubiquitous iron lines gives a more pronounced rapid frequency dependence of the model polarization spectra for the normally - bright sne  ia near maximum as contrasted with the relatively smooth variation predicted for the polarization spectra of the subluminous events .",

    ", this method suggests that the @xmath75 @xmath142 with @xmath79 which is consistent with the best fits for the ism based on detailed models ( @xmath75@xmath143 ) .",
    "based on a delayed detonation model , synthetic nlte - spectra have been computed and compared to the observations .",
    "the free parameters have been adopted from a spherical delayed detonation model that reproduces the infrared spectrum of sn  1999by between 1 and 2 @xmath144 and its evolution with time ( gerardy et al . 2000 ) .",
    "no further tuning of the initial model is done to fit the polarization data , although three new parameters must be introduced , the axis ratio , the angle of the line of sight to an observer , and the isp . the isp could be taken from the observations , but the theoretical analysis independently confirms the empirical value .",
    "the axis ratio and inclination angle are constrained by two aspects of the observations : the overall level of polarization and the shapes of spectral features .",
    "the initial spherical model is remapped to an ellipsoidal geometry with an axis ratio of @xmath94 .",
    "the axis ratio @xmath94 has been adjusted to provide the overall level of @xmath1 observed .",
    "both the optical flux spectra and polarization spectra of sn  1999by can be reproduced by models with an asphericity of @xmath4 which is seen equator on .",
    "higher inclinations , which require larger axis ratios to give the overall polarization , can be ruled out from the spurious frequency dependence of the resulting polarization spectra .",
    "the relatively high polarization we observe for sn  1999by may be a significant clue to the nature of sne  ia .",
    "existing limits on polarization of other sne  ia are very sparse ( 7 objects at the time of this paper , see table 2 ) .",
    "the polarization due to asphericity decreases with inclination , further reducing the significance of any statistics . within these limitations",
    ", we would have expected to see more polarized sne  ia if @xmath145 to @xmath146 is common .",
    "the lack of such detections supports the notion that the intrinsic polarization of the subluminous sn 1999by is unusually large .",
    "another argument is that , although small , the size of the asymmetry we derive implies a change of the observed luminosity of about @xmath117 from equator to pole .",
    "this spread is larger by a factor of @xmath147 than the mean dispersion in the brightness - decline relation @xmath148 ( hamuy et al .",
    "1995 ; riess et al .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath148 is dominated by the normally - bright sne  ia and the orientation of the symmetry axis of a given supernova is arbitrary . taken together , these facts again suggest that the asphericity is unusually large for sn 1999by compared to most normally - bright sne  ia .",
    "the low mean polarization observed for the normal sn  1996x ( wwh97 ) is consistent with this .",
    "if future observations confirm that the large asphericity of sn  1999by is characteristic of subluminous sne  ia , this may provide important clues to the physical reasons for both normal and less - than - normal peak luminosity .",
    "our quantitative analysis of the data of sn 1999by was based on delayed - detonation models with imposed asphericity without addressing the question of the physical mechanism which produces aspherical envelopes . within the delayed detonation model , possible mechanisms to induce asymmetry",
    "include the following : 1 ) instabilities in the nuclear burning front during the deflagration phase , 2 ) rapid rotation of the progenitor white dwarf , 3 ) delayed detonation transition at a point rather than simultaneously on a sphere , and 4 ) impact of the supernova ejecta on the secondary star .",
    "aspherical configurations may also be the result of 5 ) the merging process of two degenerate white dwarfs and 6 ) , in principle , edge - lit helium detonations in sub - chandrasekhar mass wds .",
    "studies of the deflagration phase of dd models reveal large plumes of burning material ( e.g. khokhlov 1995 , 2000 ; niemeyer & hillebrandt 1995 ) .",
    "these plumes may leave their imprint on the chemical structure of the ejecta .",
    "the plumes do not significantly perturb the density distribution and hence will not explain global asymmetries in the overall density structure ( khokhlov 2000 ) , but could leave an imprint at composition interfaces .",
    "wwh97 suggested this mechanism as a possible explanation for the polarization signatures seen in sn  1996x , but these plumes are an unlikely explanation for the global deviations from sphericity with a well - defined axis of symmetry as in sn  1999by .",
    "livne ( 1999 ) pointed out that we can not expect a deflagration / detonation transition on a sphere as implicitly assumed in spherical models , but that the transition may begin at one point .",
    "detailed 2d calculations showed large scale asymmetries , but livne only followed the explosion process .",
    "he did not follow the calculation into the homologous expansion , which may or may not destroy any initial asphericities by the time of maximum light when the observations of sn  1999by were taken .",
    "it is also not clear why such a mechanism should apply to subluminous sne  ia and not , perhaps , to most sne  ia .    in any accretion model",
    ", we expect an impact of the supernova ejecta with the secondary star .",
    "marietta , burrows , & fryxell ( 2000 ) computed 2d numerical simulations of the impact of an sn  ia explosion with hydrogen - rich main sequence , subgiant , and red giant companions .",
    "they find that the blast strips main sequence and subgiant companions of 15% of their mass while red giants lose @xmath17 97% of their envelopes ( 0.5 ) .",
    "the impact of the ejecta with the secondary star creates a hole in the debris of angular size @xmath149 , corresponding to @xmath17 10% of the ejecta surface .",
    "the result was similar for all cases considered because the companion was close enough to be in roche lobe overflow .",
    "this effect may be consistent with the polarization observed in sn 1999by , but we would expect the same effect in both normal and subluminous sne  ia which may be in conflict with the low polarization observed in normally - bright sne  ia .",
    "mahaffey & hansen ( 1975 ) calculated a rotating detonation model , but no detailed models have been calculated for rapidly rotating , deflagrating white dwarfs .",
    "rapid rotation will produce a global distortion of the density structure of the presupernova wd ( mller & eriguchi 1985 ) and may also affect the propagation of nuclear burning fronts in the supernova , resulting in small asphericities .",
    "we regard this possibility as very attractive since the combined effect of rotational distortion and modification of the nuclear deflagration front has the potential to link the subluminosity of sn 1999by to the large , global asymmetry .",
    "a comparison with model 7 of mller & eriguchi suggests that even with solid body rotation ( which produces the minimum distortion for a given angular momentum ) , sufficient rotation to distort the structure in the silicon layers of our subluminous model would need to have a rotation energy only about 5% of the gravitational energy .",
    "thus a significant , but not extreme , rotation may be sufficient to explain the degree of polarization we observe in sn  1999by .",
    "rotation could thus serve as a single parameter that distinguishes normal sne  ia arising in slowly - rotating white dwarf progenitors from subluminous sne  ia that occur in more rapidly - rotating white dwarfs .",
    "one possible problem with the scenario of rotation as a single parameter is that sn properties appear to show a correlation with environment and by implication , progenitor age ( howell 2000a , b ) .    in the merging scenario ,",
    "two c / o white dwarfs merge to produce an sn ia ( webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ) .",
    "this would provide a natural explanation for the lack of hydrogen seen in ia spectra .",
    "there is evidence that such systems exist ( saffer et al .",
    "khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and hk96 parameterized merger events as spherically symmetric c / o wds with thick envelopes .",
    "they produced light curves that were in reasonable agreement with some sne  ia .",
    "doubts about the merger models have been raised .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the process show that ( unless the system ignites during the merger process ) the less massive star is disrupted into a hot envelope and an accretion disk around the primary ( benz  1990 ; rasio & shapiro 1995 ; mochkovitch , guerrero , & segretain 1997 ) . in this case , off center carbon ignition produces a flame that propagates inward , converting the star to an o+ne+mg wd ( nomoto & iben 1985 ; saio & nomoto 1985 , kawai , saio , & nomoto 1987 ; saio & nomoto 1998 ) .",
    "magnesium-24 then undergoes electron capture , inducing accretion - induced collapse , to produce a neutron star ( saio & nomoto 1985 , mochkovitch & livio 1990 , nomoto & kondo 1991 ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to ignite the system due to tidal heating during the merger process ( iben , tutukov , & fedorova 1998 ) which could produce a highly aspherical explosion .",
    "this scenario has not been demonstrated in realistic simulations , but deserves further study .",
    "we have to stress the limits of this study which must be seen only as a first step . clearly , more high quality data must be obtained to provide a statistical sample and to make use of small scale features to evaluate details of the geometry and , ultimatively , to probe details of the explosion mechanism ( e.g. the burning properties ) and the scenario ( e.g. rotation of a single rapidly rotating wd vs. merging of two wds ) .",
    "future data should have a noise level well below 0.1% to address questions of deviations from axial symmetry and to utilize the small scale variations seen in the models .",
    "this is a very feasible goal with the current and upcoming generation of 8 m class telescopes .",
    "our models are based on aspherical envelopes which are distorted artificially .",
    "although this is a reasonable approach to estimate the size of asphericity and general properties , it hardly provides the desired link to the physical mechanisms responsible .",
    "detailed hydro calculations for the various mechanism are needed . within the delayed detonation scenario ,",
    "consistent hydro calculations of rotating wds , deflagration fronts and the multi - dimensionality of the deflagration to detonation transition are feasible .",
    "although any successful model must reproduce the overall pattern in the chemical composition , alternative scenarios with full multi - dimensional hydrodynamics may do this job as well .",
    "in particular , the merging scenario needs more attention .",
