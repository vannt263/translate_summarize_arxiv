    "[ fig : rec_examples ] ) although only 77% of the information is available ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that a fair reconstruction may be possible with about 20% of missing structural information .    the information - theoretic analysis of the polycrystal reconstructions of fig .",
    "[ fig : rec_crystal ] proceeds in the same way . in the case of the single crystal ,",
    "93% of the information is ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , which is consistent with the good quality of the reconstruction . for decreasing crystallite sizes",
    ", the amount of information decreases . in the case of the smallest crystallites ,",
    "the amount of information is only about 50 % and the reconstruction is expectedly inaccurate .    the consistency of the information analysis of the single disk reconstruction was expected because fig .",
    "[ fig : information ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_i_s2_fit ] ) are based on disks of various sizes .",
    "the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_i_s2_fit ] ) for microstructures other than disks is established only for very small systems , for which the mc algorithm could be used ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] ) .",
    "the fact the present analysis enables us to predict the non - degeneracy of the crystal reconstruction strongly supports the generality of eq . ( [ eq : delta_i_s2_fit ] ) .",
    "throughout the paper , we have discussed several cases of trivially and non - trivially degenerate microstructures . we have argued that the geometrical features that contribute to decreasing the non - trivial contribution to @xmath61 are those that lead to extremal values of @xmath0 for given values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is notably the case for a single disk under periodic boundary conditions , which is the microstructure that maximizes @xmath0 for sufficiently small @xmath1 s .",
    "the crystal configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rec_crystal ] is non - degenerate for similar reasons : because of its anisotropy , that microstructure achieves extremal values of @xmath0 for many different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the opposite situation is that of a poisson point processes , for which @xmath0 takes values close to the average value @xmath285 for all @xmath286 .",
    "this leads to a huge degeneracy ( configurational entropy ) because none of the values of @xmath0 is close to being extremal .",
    "it is interesting to note that the single disk within a periodic box can be thought of as a dilute distribution of disks in all of euclidean space when the infinite number of periodically replicated cells are considered . in the case of impenetrable disks at arbitrary density , it is noteworthy that @xmath0 can be exactly expressed in terms of a one - body or low - density term ( which contains the same shape and surface area information as in the dilute regime ) and a single higher - order two - body term involving pair statistics @xcite .",
    "it is therefore the latter term that is responsible for the degeneracy of such configurations for arbitrary densities .",
    "the trivial contribution to the degeneracy @xmath61 depends on the particular rotational symmetry and chirality of the microstructure , but it is always of the order of total number of pixels in the grid @xmath17 . by contrast , the non - trivial contribution to the degeneracy can be significantly larger .",
    "the monte carlo estimation of @xmath61 shows that even a modestly sized @xmath91 poisson point process can have a degeneracy as large as @xmath287 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_13points ] ) .",
    "this value is expected to increase exponentially with the size of the system because any possible @xmath98-preserving pixel displacement contributes multiplicatively to @xmath61 .    in order to quantitatively",
    "address the question of the degeneracy corresponding to any specified correlation function , we have mapped it to the determination of a ground - state degeneracy .",
    "this mapping led us to two breakthroughs .",
    "first , we now can calculate for the first time the density of states for reconstruction problems via a monte carlo algorithm , and in particular to determine the values of @xmath61 for a few benchmark systems .",
    "second , we built on the general observation throughout physics that large ground - state degeneracies are generally associated with rough energy landscapes , which enabled us to use the roughness of the energy landscape as a proxy for the microstructural degeneracy .",
    "a natural metric for the roughness of the energy landscape is the total curvature of the energy surface , evaluated at the ground - states . using a random walk in configuration space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : random_walk ] ) , we derived an analytic expression for the total energy - surface curvature in the form of @xmath243 , which can be calculated in terms of @xmath0 alone .",
    "the monte carlo analysis confirms that @xmath243 is indeed highly correlated with the degeneracy of a reconstruction problem , independently of the type or microstructure considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] ) .",
    "it has to be noted that the roughness metric is consistent with the intuitive analysis of degeneracy in terms of extremal values of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the main contribution to the denominator @xmath166 is @xmath288 , so that any value of @xmath0 larger or smaller than @xmath285 contributes to decreasing the roughness metric , and hence the degeneracy .",
    "a counterintuitive result of the present study is that the distinction between trivial and non - trivial degeneracy is irrelevant in configuration space @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , the quantitative relationship found between @xmath61 and the roughness metric does not discriminate the two types of degeneracy .",
    "this enabled us to use trivially - degenerate microstructures to generate a single calibration relation for @xmath61 as a function of @xmath243 . that relation applies to a large variety of microstructures of sizes much larger than those analyzable by the monte carlo method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : information ] ) .",
    "we should point out that although the examples discussed in the present work are all two - dimensional microstructures , the same methodology can be applied in any space dimension .",
    "it is indeed noteworthy that eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) and the approximation eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma2c_approximation ] ) are valid in any space dimension . as a consequence ,",
    "the roughness metric of any higher - dimensional microstructure can be calculated easily from its correlation function @xmath0 alone .",
    "moreover , the observation that we make that the relation between the roughness metric and the ground - state degeneracy does not discriminate trivial from non - trivial degeneracy is also expected to hold in any space dimension .",
    "therefore , higher - dimensional trivially - degenerate microstructures ( e.g. hyperspheres ) can be used to produce a relation equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_i_s2_fit ] ) or fig .",
    "[ fig : information ] in any space dimension .    it is also noteworthy that our analytical results do not assume euclidean space : the only restriction is that @xmath289 should be independent of @xmath25 , where @xmath28 is the operator used to define @xmath0 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : definition_p ] ) .",
    "therefore , the mathematical expression of the roughness metric is valid in hyperbolic and spherical spaces as well as in any dimension .",
    "however , the relationship between the degeneracy ( configurational entropy ) and the roughness metric is expected to be space- and dimension - dependent .",
    "the use of information - theoretic concepts allows our methods to be easily applied in practice . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "two - point correlation functions are often the only data available experimentally for in situ studies with a nanometer resolution , notably through small - angle scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "the question of the structural ambiguity of small - angle scattering patterns is an old one @xcite , but the recent development of very intense x - ray sources @xcite has ignited a very lively debate about the possibility of reconstructing nanometer - scale objects from scattering patterns @xcite .",
    "our analysis provides a novel and very general approach to address this type of question : an accurate reconstruction is possible whenever the amount of information @xmath280 is close to one .",
    "the examples that we have discussed suggest that a relatively accurate reconstruction is possible with up to 20% missing information , but it is premature to formulate any general rule .",
    "it has to be stressed that , although the present work is based on the reconstruction of microstructures defined on a grid with exact distances , the results apply unchanged to the discrete reconstruction of microstructures starting from experimental ( i.e. , continuous ) correlation functions .",
    "correlation functions of the type of the monocrystal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rec_crystal ] ) are unrealistic in an experimental context . however , the general relation between @xmath243 and @xmath276 still holds .",
    "the only difference is that experimental correlation functions of disordered systems are generally of the polycrystal type , with very small crystallites . except in some exceptional cases ,",
    "it is therefore expected that experimental correlation functions with no orientation information should be highly degenerate .",
    "the domain of applications of our results is not limited to scattering .",
    "other applications can notably be found in the field of computer vision for texture recognition .",
    "a texture with low degeneracy @xmath61 can in principle be discriminated robustly based on two - point statistics alone , which would make slower three - point characterizations unnecessary @xcite .",
    "besides applications , information - theoretic concepts are also useful conceptually .",
    "it is very natural that a reconstruction be possible whenever the information content of the available data is equal to the amount of information required , i.e. @xmath17 bits where @xmath17 is the total number of pixels . in the cases we considered ,",
    "the information came in the form of one - point statistics @xmath269 and of two - point statistics @xmath276 .",
    "however , the approach could be generalized naturally to higher - order statistics @xcite .",
    "quite generally , a successful reconstruction would require all correlations to be considered up to the @xmath290th order , with @xmath290 satisfying @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the information contained in n - point correlation function @xmath293 in addition to @xmath294 .",
    "there is some evidence supporting the view that @xmath295 does not contain significant information in addition to @xmath98 @xcite . in the present context",
    "this suggests that the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq : information_series ] ) converges slowly .",
    "the approach could be further generalized to other types of statistical descriptors including lineal statistics @xcite , pore - size functions @xcite , and cluster correlation functions @xcite .",
    "we stress that the present work has numerous ramifications in materials sciences and beyond . for instance , an important question concerns the realizability of two - point correlation functions @xcite . it would be interesting to explore whether new necessary conditions for the realizability of @xmath0 can be obtained by expressing that the information content ( in bits ) can not exceed the total number of pixels in the microstructure .",
    "last but not least , other applications can be found in physics . indeed , the hamiltonian of any system with pairwise additive energy can be written as @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the pair interaction potential .",
    "it results from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairwise_energy ] ) that systems with identical @xmath0 necessarily have the same energy .",
    "therefore the degeneracy @xmath61 calculated from @xmath0 is a lower bound for the physical ground - state degeneracy of any system with pairwise interaction energy .",
    "this includes systems such as frustrated ising models for which the ground - state degeneracy is not trivial @xcite .",
    "another fascinating field of application is that of quasi - crystalline microstructures @xcite , the degeneracy of which could be analyzed with the general results obtained in the present study .",
    "> from a methodological point of view , the general approach we have developed may be valuable in the manifold of fields where complex energy landscapes have to be characterized .",
    "these include protein folding @xcite , complex chemical reactions @xcite , phase equilibria in disordered porous materials @xcite , and glass transitions @xcite .",
