    "astronomy of ultra - high - energy ( uhe ; energy @xmath0  ev ) cosmic rays ( crs ) is a new branch of science whose birth we are currently witnessing . to identify uhecr sources is therefore an important and challenging task .",
    "observational evidence in favour of particular sources is limited by low statistics , by systematic uncertainties in determination of the primary - particle type and energy , by deflection of charged particles in unknown cosmic magnetic fields and by other confusing effects in the analysis . theoretically , several compelling mechanisms of uhecr acceleration have been developed and",
    "a number of potential astrophysical sources have been suggested ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and summary ) .",
    "physical conditions in potential sources are often uncertain thus preventing one from firm identification of theoretically most favoured candidates .",
    "recently , considerable interest has been attracted by a claim of correlation of positions of nearby active galaxies with arrival directions of uhecr particles detected by the pierre auger observatory ( pao )  @xcite .",
    "the correlation was interpreted as an evidence that uhecr particles are protons either from nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or from other sources with a similar distribution in space .",
    "the agn interpretation was considered likely based on the previous works favouring agn as possible uhecr accelerators .",

    "@xcite , we analyzed general constraints from geometry of the source and from radiation losses which restrict potential astrophysical accelerators and compared them to the most recent astrophysical data .",

    "[ sec : pao : corr ] , we briefly review the auger result emphasising particular details of the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite and demonstrate that the correlation signal is strong only if a single nearest - neighbour potential source is counted for each event and diminishes in the correlation - function approach when every pair `` event  source '' is counted both in the data and in the simulations .",

    "[ sec : pao : individual ] , their properties .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that these objects can accelerate protons up to the observed energies and discuss implications of this conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "recently , the pierre auger collaboration reported a significant deviation from isotropy of the arrival directions of the highest - energy cosmic rays observed by their surface detector  @xcite .",
    "they studied an ( unpublished ) set of events with energies @xmath1  ev and cross - correlated their arrival directions with positions of active galaxies from the vron catalog  @xcite .",
    "three cuts were tuned to maximize the signal : ( 1 )  the minimal reconstructed energy of a cosmic - ray particle , @xmath2 ; ( 2 )  the maximal redshift of a galaxy , @xmath3 ; ( 3 )  the maximal angular separation @xmath4 between a galaxy and a cosmic - ray arrival direction at which they are counted as correlated .",
    "an excess of correlated event ",
    "galaxy pairs over the number expected for isotropic distribution was found ; the signal was maximized for @xmath5  ev , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "after the signal had been verified in an independent data set with the same cuts ( the probability of chance correlation in the independent set of 12 events was found to be @xmath8 ) , details of the correlations were studied in the full data set  @xcite .",
    "the full set was again subject to the same scans in @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; the minimal formal probability of @xmath11 occured at @xmath12  ev , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the part of the data set which maximizes the correlation signal ( 27 events ) was published  @xcite and may be used for analysis and further studies while the full data set remains unavailable . to estimate @xmath15 from @xmath16 , one may use the so - called penalty factor ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) which compensates for the artificial signal obtained by tuning the cuts or , in other words , for multiple tries ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion ) .",
    "this penalty factor should be determined by monte - carlo simulations  @xcite which are however quite lengthy for these low @xmath16 .",
    "one may estimate it roughly by counting the number of tries : the scan in @xmath17 in steps of 0.001 gives 25 tries , the scan in @xmath18 in steps of @xmath19 gives 71 tries and the scan in @xmath20  ev with unspecified step gives effectively the number of tries equal to the number of events in the sample , that is 27 .",
    "altogether , the penalty factor is roughly @xmath21 ( in practice , the penalty factor should be somewhat lower because the tries are not independent ) and @xmath22    the consistency in probabilities ( @xmath23 up to an order - of - magnitude correction which may be attributed to unpublished tries with other catalogs ) and in the values of the tuned cut parameters in the full data set and in the first half supports that a significant deviation from isotropy , and not an outstanding chance fluctuation , was indeed observed .",
    "the interpretation of this anisotropy is however not unique .",
    "firstly , active galaxies may serve only as a tracer of the actual sources which could be distributed in the universe in a similar way  indeed , most potential sources follow the distribution of galaxies which locally is not uniform due to superclusters and voids .",
    "this interpretation can not be distinguished from the simplest hypothesis that the agn are cosmic - ray sources based on the present - level correlation signal ; both are unified in the _ agn hypothesis _ of the auger collaboration : most of the cosmic rays reaching the earth in that energy range are protons from nearby astrophysical sources , either agn or other objects with a similar spatial distribution  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation requires a large ( of order a hundred  @xcite ) number of sources .",
    "secondly , it has been shown  @xcite that a similar signal may be easily produced in case of just a few nearby sources but larger deflection angles ( consistent with the chemical composition of the cosmic rays observed by the fluorescent detector of the same pierre auger observatory  @xcite and by the yakutsk experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the origin of a significant part of cosmic - ray particles in the nearby fr  i radio galaxy cen  a may explain  @xcite the observed signal for the angular spread @xmath24 typical for intermediate - mass nuclei arriving from a source with these galactic coordinates  @xcite . moreover , this kind of interpretation is actually supported by statistical analyses of the global distribution of the arrival directions of the cosmic rays in the maximally correlated auger sample  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , under the agn hypothesis , a similar number of events is expected from the directions of the virgo and centaurus superclusters ( the latter is significantly farther but the former is observed by auger with much lower exposure ) . in practice , however , no events came from virgo while the centaurus region dominates the correlation  @xcite .",
    "alternative interpretations of the auger signal have been considered also in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thirdly , independent experiments disagree about the presence of a similar correlation in their data . using a dataset of a similar size , the high resolution fly s eye experiment ( hires )",
    "did not find a correlation with nearby vron agn either by applying the pao prescription or performing similar scans in @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the data of the yakutsk extensive air - shower array support the correlation  @xcite ; the strongest signal occurs at @xmath25 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 close to the values prescribed by pao though the angular resolution of the experiment and possibly the energy scale are different .",
    "we note that uhecr correlations with nearby seyfert galaxies from catalog  @xcite have been discovered by uryson in 1999  @xcite using the agasa and yakutsk data for somewhat lower energies @xmath26  ev . however , a similar sample of seyfert galaxies from the vron catalog does not correlate with the same cosmic - ray sample  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we analyse the observed correlation from a completely different point of view .      in any correlation analysis similar to that of  @xcite ,",
    "the number of observed pairs `` event  source '' is compared to that expected from chance coincidence .",
    "the definition of the `` number of pairs '' is however not unique : when an event is found within the angular distance @xmath4 from @xmath27 sources and @xmath28 , the `` number of pairs '' may be counted either as 1 ( counting only * nearest - neighbour * source for each event ) or as @xmath27 ( counting * every source  event pair * ) .",
    "clearly , the same rules should be applied both to the data set and to the monte - carlo sets used to estimate the expected number . while the nearest - neighbour approach may be psychologically favoured because a single cosmic - ray particle can not originate in several sources , it is the second approach which is widely applied in statistical studies by terms of the * correlation function * between two sets of points ( events and sources ) .    for an isotropic distribution of potential sources on the sky ( when clustering of sources at the angular scale @xmath29 is consistent with chance coincidence ) , both approaches give qualitatively similar results and both may serve to test the association between the ensemble of sources and the ensemble of cosmic rays . when sources are clustered at the angular scale @xmath29 ( which is the case for the agn sample used by pao ) ,",
    "it is the correlation - function approach which should be used to study the correlation between ensembles , while the nearest - neighbour method may still be used to determine particular sources .",
    "if the correlation exists with the population of ( clustered ) sources , one can not say which particular objects are responsible for individual events ; the correlation is a collective effect of many sources separated from the cosmic - ray arrival directions by angles @xmath30 .",
    "a similar effect is expected if the sample of the sources under study is just a tracer of other sources with a similar distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the correlation - function approach reveals no signal but the nearest - neighbour approach does reveal some , this is a strong argument that some of these nearest - neighbour sources may be related to particular events ( we will see below that it is precisely what happens with the auger correlation ) .",
    "this statement , to be discussed in detail elsewhere , may be easily understood by comparison of two cases : a large number of weak sources versus a small number of strong sources in the sample .",
    "the key point of the calculation of the probability of chance correlation used in pao papers  @xcite is the calculation of the fraction of the ( exposure - weighted ) sky area covered by circles with radius @xmath4 centered on the potential sources in the catalog .",
    "this fraction , called @xmath31 in refs .",
    "@xcite , allows to estimate the probability of chance correlation in the nearest - neighbour approach simply by the binomial distribution , cf .",
    "@xcite . as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : onlynearestornot ] ,     illustration of two approaches to estimate the correlation signal for clustered sources .",
    "suppose that the circles of radius @xmath4 ( area @xmath32 ) around @xmath28 potential sources ( grey circles on the plot ; @xmath33 in this example ) overlap and the cosmic - ray arrival direction ( star ) falls in the overlapping region .",
    "in the nearest - neighbour approach ( left panel ) , each cosmic - ray event is associated with only one source ; the area @xmath34 covered by circles on the sky is counted once independently of overlaps . in the correlation - function approach ( right panel ) , each pair `` source  event '' is counted ( @xmath33 pairs in the example ) and the overlapping area is counted @xmath27 times in the calculation of @xmath34.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    @xmath31 may be calculated in two different ways : in the `` nearest - neighbour '' approach , the total covered area of the sky is counted independently of overlaps , while in the correlation - function approach , the overlap area of two circles is counted twice .",
    "let us study , by means of the two methods , the sets of 27 cosmic - ray events and of 422 agn which maximize the auger correlation . in the nearest - neighbour approach and for @xmath14 , we find @xmath35 , the number of correlated pairs is 20 at 5.6 expected by chance , so @xmath36 in agreement with the auger claim . in the correlation - function approach , @xmath37 ,",
    "the number of correlated pairs is 25 at 8.4 expected by chance , so @xmath38 , several orders of magnitude higher is estimated by the monte - carlo simulations . ] . in the case under discussion , these two differ qualitatively : when @xmath16 is multiplied by the penalty factor @xmath39 , the nearest - neighbour mehtod gives , as discussed above , a significant signal , while the correlation - function result is consistent with absence of any correlation .",
    "this particularly strange pattern of correlation signals suggests that , if the signal is not a chance fluctuation , then the `` nearest neighbours '' of correlated events should be the actual sources of cosmic rays . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will therefore study the properties of these `` nearest neighbours '' .",
    "the list of the sources responsible for the auger correlation is given in table  [ tab : list ] . in this section ,",
    "we analyze available data on physical conditions in these galaxies and compare them with requirements for uhecr acceleration discussed in ref .",

    "<S> we analyze the active - galaxy correlation reported in 2007 by the pierre auger collaboration . the signal diminishes if the correlation - function approach ( counting all `` source  event '' pairs and not only `` nearest neighbours '' ) is used , suggesting that the correlation may reveal individual sources and not their population . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze available data on physical conditions in these individual correlated sources and conclude that acceleration of protons to the observed energies is hardly possible in any of these galaxies , while heavier nuclei would be deflected by the galactic magnetic field thus spoiling the correlation . </S>",
    "<S> our results question the auger interpretation of the reported anisotropy signal but do not contradict to its explanation with intermediate - mass nuclei accelerated in cen  a. </S>"
