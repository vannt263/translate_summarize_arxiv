    "the study of thermal radiation began in late nineteenth and early twentieth century . in 1906 , planck evoked in his magisterial work @xcite the notion of far - field assumption , namely the wavelengths of interest are much smaller compared to the spatial extensions of the objects considered .",
    "combined with kirchhoff s black - body idealization , the radiative heat transfer between two bodies in the far - field regime is then bounded by stefan - boltzmann law . in 1969 , hargreaves @xcite reported an anomalous radiative heat transfer between two chromium plates separated at a distance less than 3 @xmath0 m , surpassing the black - body limit .",
    "since then , there has been a surge in research activities @xcite concerning radiative heat transfer in the near - field regime , from polder and van hove s pioneering work @xcite in 1971 , to the experimental measurements of st - gelais et al .",
    "@xcite in 2016 . of particular interest is the geometry of planar layered media @xcite , where the case of metamaterial @xcite and coated media @xcite were further investigated .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    meanwhile , recent years have seen growing interests in interdisciplinary studies @xcite involving both thermal radiation and mesoscopic transport , which is not surprising considering their similarities . in this work ,",
    "we wish to strengthen this connection by revisiting the case of two layered media separated by vacuum with conductive interfaces .",
    "while earlier works @xcite were targeted at the tunability of radiative transfer when bulk dielectrics are covered by graphene sheets , here we focus on the energy - balance aspect . in so doing ,",
    "we find it natural  at least for our system of interest  to regard radiative heat transfer as a four - terminal transport problem .",
    "once a set of detailed - balance conditions are checked , radiative heat transfer becomes a landauer - bttiker model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lb ] .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the summary of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first fix notations and describe the model . electromagnetic propagation in layered media with conductive interfaces",

    "next , we outline the steps to calculate the radiative heat transfer .",
    "the main novelty of this work starts from sec .",
    "[ subsec : landauer ] , where we present a four - terminal landauer - bttiker viewpoint for the problem of interest .     as a four - terminal landauer - bttiker transmission problem .",
    "planar symmetry reduces the interfaces to two dots , serving as a scattering center enclosed by the dashed rectangle . ]    the electromagnetic energy in each bath is related to the bose function via a conductance matrix .",
    "this allows for more transparent energy balance in each terminal ( bulk medium or interface ) , elucidates the ballistic aspect of fluctuational electrodynamics , provides another justification for neglecting propagating mode in near - field radiative transfer .",
    "we then illustrate with an example of a graphene - coated gold radiating to a suspended graphene sheet .",
    "we work in the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics @xcite , where sources are considered as thermal noises , whose auto - correlation functions can be deduced from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we consider layered media aligned along @xmath1 direction , whose cross - sections are modeled to be infinitely large .",
    "we are interested in steady - state transport , so all time arguments will be fourier - transformed to frequency .",
    "we adopt the standard convention of fourier transform which results in the following replacement : @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a three - dimensional wave - vector . a point in space",
    "will be denoted by @xmath5 and in plane @xmath6 .",
    "the perpendicular subscript @xmath7 indicates transverse to @xmath1 direction .",
    "we use @xmath8 to denote the permittivity of free space and @xmath9 to denote the dimensionless dielectric constant of medium @xmath10 .",
    "we consider two semi - infinite half - spaces , kept at temperatures @xmath11 with local dielectric functions @xmath12 , separated by vacuum at a distance @xmath13 away from each other .",
    "the interfaces are equipped with additional properties : they are given temperatures @xmath14 and local conductivities @xmath15 .     and dielectric functions @xmath16 separated by a vacuum gap ( @xmath17 ) at a distance @xmath13 apart .",
    "the interfaces in contact with vacuum are at temperatures @xmath14 with conductivities @xmath18 .",
    "the planar cross - sections should be understood to be infinitely large . ]    ordinarily , the interfaces  being in contact with the bulk  are naturally given the same temperatures as their respective slabs .",
    "a landauer - bttiker perspective shows that these temperatures can in principle be different . finally , we consider non - magnetic linear isotropic media , so that the constitutive relations are given by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .      for electromagnetic propagation in media ,",
    "the inhomogeneities in maxwell equations are excessive charges and currents , which in the present context are assumed to originate from thermal fluctuations . in what follows",
    "we denote by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the volume ( surface ) charge density , and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the volume ( surface ) current density .",
    "we need to solve the following maxwell equations : @xmath25 in the above , not all equations are independent .",
    "in particular , gauss law and ampre s law are related by the continuity equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a `` transverse divergence '' .",
    "let us begin by considering one half - space with dielectric constant @xmath29 in contact with vacuum at @xmath30 .",
    "the dielectric function then reads : @xmath31 , where for more symmetric expressions we denoted by @xmath32 the dielectric constant of vacuum ( = 1 ) .",

    "similar reasoning follows for the magnetic induction @xmath37 .",

    "they are unit in the sense that @xmath54 . as for the delta function , unlike the previous two terms , it is not accompanied by exponential @xmath55 , representing thus a static electric field . alternatively ,",
    "if we compute the magnetic induction corresponding to this delta function , the poynting vector is @xmath56 independent , but points along @xmath57 , so it integrates to zero and does not contribute in heat transfer .      electromagnetic propagation in layered media singles out @xmath1 axis as a special direction @xmath60 .",
    "granted planar symmetry , for each fourier component we have another vector , @xmath61 .",
    "they can be completed by a third vector @xmath62 to give a right - hand triple @xmath63 . by construction",
    "this @xmath64 is orthogonal to the total wave - vector @xmath65 given by .",
    "the solution of electric field ,  , implies a posteriori that for each fourier component @xmath56 , the electric field is transverse : @xmath66 .",
    "thus with the unit - vector @xmath64 we define @xmath67 , obtaining another right - hand triple @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the @xmath59 polarization @xmath69 and wave - vector @xmath65 are generally complex vectors .",
    "therefore electric fields are described by @xmath70 , and from faraday s law we can express the magnetic field in terms of the amplitudes , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "we now turn to the role played by conductive interfaces .",
    "again we first focus on one single interface and derive its consequences . dropping the location subscripts , we write the surface current , residing purely on the interfaces , as : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a deterministic response to electric fields , @xmath74 is the fluctuating part that arises from thermal motions .",
    "we wish to solve the following problem , as shown in fig .",

    "when @xmath89 , we recover the usual fresnel law for dielectric media @xcite .",
    "we now incorporate the thermal fluctuation @xmath74 in the surface current . here , we are interested in the emission aspect of fig .  [",

    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that conductive interface generates its own field and modifies fresnel law .",
    "returning to the problem of interest , we need to solve a scattering problem with two half - spaces and two interfaces .",

    "finally , the fields on the third region are obtained by acting the matrices consecutively on : @xmath97 . in this approach , so long as for one interface we have fresnel law , it does not matter whether it is the modified coefficients  or the usual ones ( by setting @xmath89 ) .",
    "in this section we consider the energy transport by electromagnetic waves . for a clearer analogy to mesoscopic transport",
    ", we express the autocorrelation functions in fourier domain @xmath56 .",
    "this is possible because there is no spatial dispersion in the dissipative properties @xmath98 .",
    "the first task is to obtain an expression for electromagnetic energy flux density ( poynting vector ) from fields expressed in frequency .",
    "then , we need to find the autocorrelations of the fluctuating currents .",
    "we consider coherent emission , i.e. random fields @xmath99 in frequency domain are delta - correlated : @xmath100 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that @xmath99 is stationary in the wide sense @xcite : @xmath101 .",

    "we model the thermal fluctuations by random currents @xmath106 , so their statistical properties must be related to the temperature .",

    "electrons are described by wavefunctions @xmath113 , whose amplitude - squared @xmath114 represents a quantity that can be observed .",
    "analogously , here the electromagnetic field alone is fluctuating .",
    "thus , it averages to zero , but electromagnetic energy  being quadratic in the noise @xmath106is in general not zero .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    to consider non - equilibrium transport , one needs baths : a large system capable of supplying particles or energy without being appreciably affected . in our problem ,",

    "but in this calculation , no assumption is needed for bulk 1 : it is described by dielectric function @xmath29 which may very well be unity .",
    "since these two are identical : @xmath143 , we conclude that there is no harm in taking @xmath144 in the conductances @xmath145 , provided that we take its temperature to be zero : @xmath146 , so that the corresponding bose function is zero : @xmath147 , i.e. bath 1 only absorbs energy but does not radiate .",
    "the radiative transfer between two suspended two - dimensional materials is studied in several works @xcite . there",
