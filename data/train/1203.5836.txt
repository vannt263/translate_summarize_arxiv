    "the challenge to understand the effects of disorder on the behavior of particles strongly coupled to bosons from their environment is commonly encountered in correlated electron systems . for example , high - t@xmath0 cuprates are doped anti - ferromagnetic insulators in which , beside strong coupling to magnons , arpes measurements have also provided evidence for strong electron - phonon coupling.@xcite at the same time , charge carriers moving in the cuo@xmath1 layers are subject to random disorder potentials from the adjacent dopant layers . substituting only a few percent of the cu atoms with impurities suppresses superconductivity by localizing the low energy electronic states.@xcite inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap measured in high resolution tunnelling experiments have been attributed to atomic scale disorder in the phonon energy and the electron - phonon coupling strength in these materials.@xcite organic semiconductors are another class of materials where interplay between disorder and electron - phonon coupling is believed to be important in determining their properties , and are currently under active investigation.@xcite    although the results we present here are valid for any type of bosons ( so long as they can be modelled as dispersionless einstein modes ) , for simplicity in the following we restrict our discussion to optical phonons .",
    "the result of the interplay between disorder and coupling to such phonons depends on their relative strengths .",
    "disorder that is considered weak for free electrons can be strong enough to localize a polaron , that is the dressed quasiparticle which consists of the electron together with its cloud of phonons , because of its heavy effective mass .",
    "on the other hand , whereas in the weak disorder regime electron - phonon coupling hinders the motion of electrons , such coupling actually facilitates the electron mobility in the strongly disordered regime where the anderson localization prevails.@xcite    certain aspects of this problem have been studied with various approximations , most of which rely on sophisticated non - perturbative methods @xcite such as the statistical dynamic mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite or dynamical coherent potential approximation ( dcpa).@xcite the underlying meaning of these approximations and their accuracy is rather hard to gauge . on the computational side , refined versions of the approximation - free diagrammatic monte carlo ( dmc ) technique@xcite and of the continuous quantum monte carlo algorithm@xcite",

    ", we study the bound state formation for a three - dimensional holstein polaron in the presence of an impurity , using a generalization of the momentum average ( ma ) approximation to inhomogeneous systems.@xcite ma was originally developed to study homogeneous systems with various types of electron - phonon coupling.@xcite it is a non - perturbative method that sums in a closed - form expression all the self - energy diagrams up to exponentially small corrections that are neglected .",
    "the method can be systematically improved,@xcite therefore providing a fast yet accurate way to scan a vast range of parameters .",

    "unlike most other theoretical approximations , ma has the important benefit that its structure reveals the essential physics of such problems .",
    "it is well - known that electron - phonon coupling leads to the dressing of the particle , resulting in a polaron with a larger effective mass .",
    "what ma reveals is that the electron - phonon coupling is also responsible for a _ renormalization of the disorder potential_. this renormalization can be very large and has strong retardation effects .",
    "moreover , the renormalized potential can have a finite - range even if the bare disorder is on - site only .",
    "the single impurity problem provides us with a simple test case to understand the effects of this renormalization , and to accurately compare and contrast the behavior of the polaron in the presence of various types of local disorder .",
    "such results are a necessary first step in order to gain the intuition needed for understanding the behavior of more complicated systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe our method and discuss its meaning ( full details are provided in the appendix ) .",

    "the structure of the phonon cloud varies with energy , for instance one expects quite different clouds within the polaron band vs. at higher energies , in the continuum of incoherent states with finite lifetime .",

    "differences in the ldos at the impurity site have also been found , such as the possibility to bind multiple states near an impurity that changes the coupling , or the unusual fingerprint of discrete states both below and above the bulk polaron continuum , for an isotope bound state .",
    "of course , a realistic description of an impurity in a real system may combine several of these inhomogeneities , and even the form of the electron - phonon coupling could be affected .",
    "ma gives an efficient yet quite accurate way to deal with such cases , and can be easily generalized to other types of couplings where ma has been used succesfully to describe bulk properties .",
    "whereas we expect the single impurity results to remain valid for a system with multiple impurities if the mean free path is long and the polaron interacts with one impurity at a time , in the presence of significant disorder , when multiple scattering processes become important , the polarons can undergo anderson localization .",
