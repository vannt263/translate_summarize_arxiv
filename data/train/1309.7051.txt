    "the early calculations by svane and gunnarson showed that when self - interaction corrections were included in the local density approximation , density functional theory ( dft ) predicted a first order phase transition located near the wigner - seitz radius @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the density , and @xmath4 is the bohr radius @xcite . on the contrary , dft calculations using either",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) or local spin density approximation ( lsda ) without the self - interaction correction have predicted a second - order phase transition at @xmath5 and @xmath6 and an itenerant anti - ferromagnetic phase up to @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively @xcite .",
    "g@xmath9w@xmath9 , using the lda or gga orbitals to compute the initial green s function , finds the same transition order as their underlying dft functionals , though the phase transition density is shifted upwards to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the most recent set of g@xmath9w@xmath9 calculations begin with lda+u and gga+u single particle orbitals for the initial green s function @xcite .",
    "the `` + u '' methods include an on - site repulsion for the two different spin densities to penalize double occupancy and pushes the system towards an anti - ferromagnetic state .",
    "using g@xmath9w@xmath9 on top of these methods , researchers find a continuous metal to insulator phase transition and locate it close to @xmath11 .",
    "this phase transition has also been investigated using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) by approximating the coulomb interaction as a strictly short ranged on - site interaction between two electrons on the same hydrogen ion @xcite . using this method",
    "it was found to be a first - order phase transition at @xmath12 .",
    "this transition location is an extrapolation from their finite temperature data to the ground state @xcite .",
    "a highly accurate benchmark is required to disambiguate these results .",
    "previous efforts to produce such a benchmark have been performed using variational quantum monte carlo@xcite .",
    "this calculation was consistent with either a very weak first order or a second order transition at @xmath13 .",
    "the error estimates in these measurements are sufficiently large to include a number of the previous results .",
    "our goal in this work is to provide a benchmark with improved accuracy .",
    "in this section we will discuss the method we use , the hamiltonian for the system , and some computational aspects particular to our calculation .      in this work we use dmc to generate all of our results .",
    "this method has been used to produce benchmark results for light elements such as hydrogen and the electron gas and has been increasingly used for solid state systems @xcite .",
    "this variational stochastic projector method filters out the ground state component of a trial wave function to sample the ground state probability distribution @xcite . by using a trial wave function we are able to avoid the notorious `` sign problem '' which plagues exact monte carlo calculations of fermions but introduce error which raises the energy .",
    "the nodes or phase of the trial wave function serves as a boundary condition on the the random walk .",
    "the error introduced by this approximation is referred to as the `` fixed - node error '' @xcite .      in rydberg units ,",
    "the hamiltonian for hydrogen is , @xmath14 where capital letters , @xmath15 , correspond to ion coordinates and lower case letter , @xmath16 , correspond to electronic coordinates .",
    "this is a zero temperature calculation and does not include the kinetic energy of the protons ; they are clamped to the bcc lattice . in this work we will refer to the two atoms in the bcc unit cell as the a and b simple cubic sublattices .",
    "our trial wave function is a single slater jastrow wave function , @xmath17 where @xmath18 where @xmath19 and similarly for the down spin electrons , @xmath20 . for the ground state it is always the case that @xmath21 . for the quasiparticle calculation",
    "they differ by 1 .",
    "the jastrow consists of two terms : a one - body term , @xmath22 , and a two - body term , @xmath23@xcite and are of the form , @xmath24 where @xmath25 refer to ionic coordinates , @xmath16 refer to electron coordinates , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electron spins , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are bspline@xcite functions whose parameters are variational degrees of freedom .",
    "both the one body and two body terms include a cusp condition which , in conjunction with the determinant , exactly cancels the divergent coulomb potential energy contribution when an ion and electron or two electrons coincide@xcite .",
    "we optimize the parameters in the trial wave function using a variant of the linear method of umrigar and coworkers@xcite . instead of rescaling the eigenvalues found during the generalized eigenvalue problem , we perform a line minimization on them using a @xmath30-point fit to a quadratic function .",
    "we find that this can increase the rate of convergence to the optimal set of variational parameters@xcite .",
    "we parameterize the two - body jastrow function so that it is symmetric under exchange of up and down electron labels .",
    "this requires the same parameterization for @xmath23 between up - up and down - down pairs , @xmath31 , but allows for a separate set of parameters for up - down @xmath23 terms,@xmath32 .",
    "the one - body jastrow is parameterized differently in the paramagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic phases . in the paramagnetic phase we use a one body jastrow which is not a function of electron spin or ion sublattice . in the anti - ferromagnetic phase",
    "we use a jastrow that is the same for up - a / down - b , @xmath33 , and for up - b / down - a , @xmath34 , electron spin - ion sublattice pairs .",
    "this ensures that the wave function is unchanged if up and down electron labels are swapped at the same time as the a and b sublattice labels are .    for a slater - jastrow wave function",
    ", the magnitude of the fixed node error is affected by the quality of the single particle orbitals used in the slater determinant .",
    "there are many different orbitals that can be used in the determinant : analytic forms such as plane waves or gaussians , orbitals from density function theory , or orbitals derived from another quantum chemistry method .",
    "it has been found that , for solids , the best trial wave functions are often obtained using orbitals from dft .",
    "however , different functionals produce different orbitals , so a careful choice of functional is necessary @xcite .",
    "in this work we consider single particle orbital sets generated using three different techniques all of which are based on dft . in the paramagnetic phase we use orbitals generated using the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite . in the anti - ferromagnetic phase , as we will describe below , we use two different sets of orbitals , one generated using a lda+u functional , and the other generated by performing two lda calculations , each of which includes only the ions of one sublattice .",
    "we generate these orbitals using quantum espresso @xcite and a lda pseudopotential generated using opium @xcite .    ) .",
    "the horizontal line is the energy obtained using the split sublattice orbitals , and dashed line is a single standard deviation in energy .",
    "the minimum energy orbitals are generated using u@xmath35 .",
    "the line passing through the lda+u energies is a quadratic fit for all u@xmath36.[fig : pol_u ] ]    .",
    "the minimum energy lda+u orbitals ( circles ) are slightly less polarized than the split sublattice ones ( diamond ) .",
    "the line is a guide to the eye .",
    "[ fig : pol_e ] ]    for the anti - ferromagnetic phase , we obtain the split sublattice orbitals by performing a dft calculation on the simple cubic lattice and translating the orbitals according to the bcc basis vector , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the lattice constant .",
    "we choose to use this basis because , for the ground state , it explicitly breaks spin symmetry and creates a set of anti - ferromagnetic orbitals centered on each sublattice and has no adjustable parameters .",
    "we also use lda+u orbitals to be able to tune the degree of spin polarization in the system . the lda+u functional can interpolate between the paramagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic phases by tuning u. for small values of u the spin polarization is small and for large u",
    "it is complete .",
    "though this is a simple single parameter single particle orbital optimization technique , it can be very expensive to converge .",
    "the sensitivity of the orbitals to the choice of u is illustrated in figure [ fig : pol_u ] .",
    "the resulting energy vs. polarization curve is presented in figure [ fig : pol_e ] .",
    "to find the optimal value of u we must perform qmc calculations on large systems , 432 electrons , for several values of u and orbital occupations .",
    "the orbitals may be occupied according to the lda+u energy prediction , or by filling the lowest band regardless of lda+u occupation .",
    "these partially polarized phases exhibit large finite size effects , and require large simulation cells to accurately determine the optimal u , its polarization and energy . near the phase transition",
    "the lda+u basis provides a better description of the anti - ferromagnetic state as evidenced by lower energies .",
    "because the dmc uses the full coulomb potential for the electron - ion potential , the only effect the choice of pseudopotential has on our dmc results is through the quality of the single particle orbitals . to check the effect of the pseudopotential",
    ", we compared the dmc energy of the single particle orbitals generated using our lda pseudopotential with those generated using the trail - needs pseudopotential in the paramagnetic phase at @xmath39 @xcite . for the @xmath40 hydrogen supercell we found no statistical difference in their energies .",
    "as described above , we use trial wave functions for the anti - ferromagnetic phase that explicitly break spin symmetry .",
    "we compute the polarization of the phase using the sublattice spin density , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spin density for the up or down electrons , @xmath43 , on the a sublattice whose protons are located at @xmath44 , and the step function is zero outside a sphere of radius @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is defined identically but with a and b indices exchange .",
    "we are free to adjust @xmath45 between zero and @xmath47 , the wigner - seitz radius . as @xmath48 the statistics of the observable improve due to increased sampling volume . as @xmath49",
    "the estimator projects out just the spin at the sublattice proton positions .",
    "we find that @xmath50 is a reasonable compromise and use it for all densities .",
    "using these spin densities we define the a sublattice polarization , @xmath51 , as , @xmath52 in this work we only investigate phases where the polarization is symmetric , @xmath53 . in the paramagnetic phase @xmath54 and in the anti - ferromagnetic phase @xmath55 .",
    "this estimator works in trial wave function based qmc when the up / down symmetry of the state has explicitly been broken . if the trial wave function is a linear combination of up - a / down - b and up - b / down - a spin electrons assigned to sublattices , then the previous estimator yields zero even for anti - ferromagnetic phases . in that case",
    "it is necessary to compute the correlation function using the polarization operator ,",
    "@xmath56      we converge the dft calculations using a @xmath57 k - point grid for the metallic phases and @xmath58 grid for the insulating or partially polarized phases .",
    "we find that using an energy cutoff of @xmath59 rydberg is sufficient to converge the dft energy as well as the orbitals used in the quantum monte carlo .    in the paramagnetic phase , we perform dmc for a @xmath60 supercell of @xmath61 twists and @xmath62 total ions , and a @xmath63 supercell of @xmath64 twists and @xmath65 total ions using both the ewald and modified periodic coulomb ( mpc ) potential @xcite for the electrons @xcite .",
    "these runs were performed with more than two thousand configurations and extrapolated to zero time step using a three point extrapolation .",
    "the smallest time steps had accept ratios greater than @xmath66 .",
    "the energy is then averaged over twist points and the two supercells are extrapolated linearly as volume@xmath67 to infinite volume .",
    "we find that both the ewald and mpc extrapolate to similar values , and forgo larger simulation cells in the extrapolation .",
    "we put more effort into computing the properties of the anti - ferromagnetic phase because it is relatively more complex than the paramagnetic phase .",
    "because the anti - ferromagnetic phase is insulating , we use a smaller number of twists . the finite size and brillouin zone sampling",
    "are done using a @xmath60 supercell of @xmath63 twists ( @xmath62 protons ) , a @xmath63 supercell of @xmath60 twists ( @xmath65 protons ) , and a @xmath64 supercell of @xmath40 twists ( @xmath68 protons ) .",
    "we locate the transition density between the paramagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic phases by computing the energy of each phase as a function of wigner - seitz radius and finding the crossing point . by carefully extrapolating finite size effects , sampling the fermi surface using twist averaging , and controlling for time step error",
    ", we determine the transition density within a small statistical error @xcite .",
    "we control for systematic error , due to the fixed node approximation , by comparing the energies for several different sets of single particle orbitals in the anti - ferromagnetic phase and by using a slater - jastrow - backflow wave function in the paramagnetic phase .",
    ".fixed - phase dmc energy per hydrogen atom in rydberg for bcc hydrogen in the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) , and paramagnetic ( pm ) phases.[tbl : h_eos ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the gaps we compute and reference values from previous studies are presented in table [ table : gaps ] .",
    "the excitonic gap extrapolates to zero gap while the quasiparticle gap projects to a small but finite gap , @xmath69 .",
    "both of these gaps are consistent with a phase transition location closer to @xmath39 than previous g@xmath9w@xmath9 studies .",
    "we note that the quasiparticle gap suffers from much larger finite size effects than the excitonic gap which results in a more difficult extrapolation and larger error bar estimate . at this density ,",
    "an estimate for the excitonic binding energy , the difference between the excitonic and quasiparticle gap extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit , is @xmath70 .",
    "we have presented benchmark calculations on the phase transition density and order for bcc hydrogen .",
    "as shown in table [ tbl : heos_prev ] , the phase transition is likely to be continuous and is located at @xmath71 .",
    "the most recent g@xmath9w@xmath9 calculations@xcite show the same transition order and agree very well with our transition location .",
    "if these calculations were to choose a slightly different value of u , they may be brought into perfect agreement .",
    "previous publications@xcite using g@xmath9w@xmath9 resulted in slightly less accurate transition densities , likely due to a worse dft starting point .",
