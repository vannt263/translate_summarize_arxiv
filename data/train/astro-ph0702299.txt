    "regions are used as the most reliable targets to derive actual abundances in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) discussed the problem of determining the heavy - element abundance of very metal - poor blue compact dwarf galaxies from emission lines of regions in the light of local self - enrichment by massive stars but have more stressed the effect by supernovae type ii ( sneii ) ejected material .",
    "however , already during the wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase of massive stellar evolution the stellar wind peels off the outermost stellar layers , so that elements from shell - burning regimes are released into the surrounding ism already at later stages of their normal lifetimes . since the stellar wind energetics let one presume that this gas is deposited into the hot phase only , it was not yet reliably explored in detail how and to what extent the complex structure of the stellar wind bubble ( swb ) could facilitate the cooling of wind material , by this , making it attainable for observations of the gas ..    that wr stars should play an important role for c enrichment of the ism at solar metallicity was advocated by @xcite ( 2003 ) .",
    "their models predict that the c enrichment by wr stars is at least comparable to that by agb stars , while the enrichment by n is dominated by agb stars and the o enrichment is dominated by sneii .",
    "their investigation , however , sums over all gas phases and avoids to evaluate the abundances in specific gas phases for detailed diagnostics , like e.g. in the warm gas .    in a series of models of radiation - driven and wind - blown bubbles produced by massive stars we investigated the effects of structuring and energizing the surrounding ism for a 15 star ( @xcite , in preparation ) , a 35 ( @xcite 2006 ) , a 60 ( @xcite 2003 : paper i ) , and a 85 star ( @xcite 2006b ) . from these , we could conclude that differently strong but significant structures are formed by the combined dynamical and radiative processes between the swb and the enveloping region ( in particular , see paper i ) where hot gas mixes with the warm one and cools further to  warm  phase .",
    "the mixing occurs mainly in the back of the swb shell with photo - evaporated material and through turbulence in an interface between swb and shell ( see e.g. fig.[fig1 ] ) .    nevertheless , the wr stage is metal dependent in the sense that , at first , the lower the metallicity the more massive a star has to be to evolve through the wr stages and that , secondly , the lower the metallicity the shorter are the wr lifetimes and not all wr stages are reached .",
    "the first point means , that the number of wr stars decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "@xcite ( 1992 ; hereafter : ssmm ) found that for a metallicity of @xmath3=0.001 the minimal zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) mass for a wr star is @xmath4 80 while at solar @xmath3=0.02 it is @xmath4 25 as already discussed by @xcite ( 1986 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are solved together with the transfer of h - ionizing photons on a two - dimensional cylindrical grid . for reasons of a refined resolution mainly in the central part around the star",
    ", the grid is structured by a nested scheme .",
    "the time - dependent ionization and recombination of hydrogen is calculated in each time step and we carefully take stock of all the important energy exchange processes in the system . a detailed description of the numerical method and further references are given in paper i.    as initial condition an undisturbed homogeneous background gas with solar abundances ( @xcite 1989 ) , hydrogen number density n@xmath5=20 @xmath6 , and temperature t@xmath5=200 k is applied for the reasons described in paper i. the models are then started with the sudden turn - on of the zams stellar radiation field and stellar wind . since the gas is assumed as void of molecular stuff the radiation field commences immediately to ionized the environment outwards of the swb without an enveloping photo - dissociation region . from a series of models of radiation and wind - driven regions around single massive stars mentioned above , for our purpose",
    "the 85 star ( @xcite 2006b ) looks as the most appropriate with respect to its self - enrichment .",
    "the time - dependent parameters of this star with `` standard '' mass - loss and solar metallicity ( @xmath3=0.02 ) during its h main - sequence and its subsequent evolution are taken from ssmm .",
    "the model analysis is already published by us ( @xcite 2006a ) .    the according exploration starts not before the onset of the wr stage , in particular with the onset of the wn stage at an age of t=2.83 myrs .",
    "the wr star enriches the combined swb / region with @xmath1c , @xmath0n , and @xmath2o . during its wn phase",
    "the star releases 0.143 @xmath0n , which is more than half of its total release , but nearly no extra @xmath1c or @xmath2o is supplied . as the condition for observability within the region only the `` warm '' gas @xmath7",
    "is accounted for .",
    "the mass fractions of @xmath1c , @xmath0n , and @xmath2o with respect to solar are set according to @xcite ( 1989 ) to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively , normalized to h.",
    "at the end of its lifetime at @xmath11 the 85 star has supplied 0.28 of @xmath0n , 13.76 of @xmath1c , and 11.12 of @xmath2o , which are contained in the combined swb/ region .",
    "since n was released at first in the wn stage it increases slightly in this period and is thereafter diluted by the nitrogen - poor gas feed .",
    "these facts are discernible in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by a first rise and a subsequent decrease of the n abundance in the hot phase after the transition to the wc stage when c and o are released .",
    "the @xmath1c content increases steeply and reaches an overabundance of 38 times solar while the enrichment with @xmath2o is weaker ( fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] the c distribution as the element of largest contribution is revealed in comparison with the temperature distribution at the end of the stellar life .",
    "two facts can be easily discerned : 1 ) the carbon enrichment is reasonably largest within the hot swb ; 2 ) also regions with the ",
    "warm  temperature range are significantly @xmath1c enriched .",
    "c , @xmath0n , and @xmath2o in the hot ( _ left panel _ ) and the warm gas phase ( _ right panel _ ) .",

    "the plot starts not before the onset of the wn phase at 2.83 myrs.,title=\"fig:\",width=211,height=211 ]    while the mixing and incorporation of @xmath0n from the hot into the warm phase becomes only slightly detectable after about 3.1 mrys , but occurs with a time delay after its release of almost 0.2 myrs , the @xmath1c enrichment in the warm phase is clearly perceivible already less than 50000 yrs after its steep rise in the hot swb .    at the end of the 85 star s life",
    "the element quantities measurable in emission spectra of the warm region gas amount to 1.22 times solar for @xmath1c , to less than 1.01 for @xmath0n , and to only 1.05 solar for @xmath2o . from this model",
    "we conclude that the enrichment of the circumstellar environment with @xmath0n and @xmath2o by wr stars is negligible , if the 85 star is representative for massive stars passing the wr stage . only for @xmath1c",
    "the enrichment of the region is significant . for a giant region containing a full set of massive stars according to a normal initial mass function and with different lifetimes and wind mass - loss rates the enrichment effect of c should",
    ", however , become smaller than modelled here for a single most massive star .",
    "a comprehensive description and discussion of the model is already published by @xcite ( 2006a ) .",
    "since the occurrence of a wr phase is strongly metal dependent , the enrichment with c should also depend on the average metallicity .",
    "this would mean that any radial gradient of c abundance of regions in galactic disks is steeper than that of o. and indeed , @xcite ( 2005 ) found d@xmath13(c / o)]/dr = @xmath14 for the galactic disk .    in metal - poor galaxies one would expect less chemical self - enrichment because the stellar mass range of the wr occurrence is shrinked and shifted rowards higher masses and the wr phases are shorter .",
