    "a special situation arises in the case of @xmath22 final states . here ,",
    "the universal @xmath147 term of the electroweak one - loop correction is almost entirely cancelled by similar contributions to the @xmath64 vertex and the @xmath13-quark wave function induced by the charged current .",
    "the two - loop @xmath201 corrections to the latter contributions are currently under study @xcite .    for @xmath185  gev ( 200  gev ) ,",
    "qcd effects screen the positive universal @xmath147 term by 6.5% ( 10.4% ) , provided the top quark mass is renormalized according to the on - shell scheme . in the @xmath66 scheme",
    ", the qcd correction has a different sign and its magnitude is roughly half as large .",
    "however , the sum of the one- and two - loop corrections is very insensitive to the choice of mass renormalization scheme . in the @xmath66 evaluation with a common renormalization scale , @xmath80 , for the strong coupling constant and the top - quark mass ,",
    "the total correction is stable under variations of @xmath80 in the vicinity of @xmath169 .",
    "this indicates that the effect of qcd corrections beyond two loops is likely to be insignificant .",
    "the author is indebted to abdel djouadi , paolo gambino , kurt riesselmann , and michael spira for very useful discussions .",
    "he would like to express his gratitude to the physics department of uw - madison for supporting a visit , during which part of this work was carried out , and for the great hospitality extended to him .",
