    "the name `` antonov problem '' is usually referred to the study of the mean - field equilibrium state of self - gravitating @xmath4-body systems of classical particles in a finite volume .",
    "one considers the system with hamiltonian @xmath5 enclosed in a finite three - dimensional spherical box of radius @xmath6 , which is necessary in order to prevent particles from evaporating . in ( [ ham],[pot ] ) : @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote , respectively , the position and momentum of the @xmath9-th particle , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 stands for the ( volume of the ) box containing the particles ; we set the particles masses to one .",
    "the main problems are : ( a ) find the equilibrium configurations , i.e. the particle density profiles @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) that maximize the microcanonical entropy ( @xmath14 constant ) @xmath15\\ ] ] ( @xmath16 ) ; and ( b ) analyze the corresponding thermodynamics .",
    "clearly , the existence of such profiles and their actual structure will depend on the value of the total energy @xmath17 . intuitively , when @xmath17 is large and positive ( that is when the kinetic term dominates ) a gaseous - type of structure will be preferred , with particles uniformly spread over @xmath11 , whereas when @xmath17 is sufficiently negative particles are expected to attract each other in a dense core embedded in a vapor .",
    "the situation presents however several subtleties . _ assuming that particles are point masses obeying boltzmann statistics in space _",
    ", i.e. that they can come arbitrarily close to each other , it is found within the mean - field approximation @xcite that    1 .",
    "there is no global entropy maximum , therefore all maxima are local and correspond to metastable situations ; 2 .   if @xmath18 ( i.e. at sufficiently high energies , for we take @xmath6 to be fixed ) there exist local entropy extrema where the particle density satisfies the condition @xmath19}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "notice that @xmath21 is itself a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the physically admissible solutions of ( [ is ] ) are spherically symmetric ( in fact , they can be mapped onto the solutions of the emden equation @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ) and are called microcanonical `` isothermal spheres '' ; 3 .   in general , local extrema in the space of @xmath22 s can be maxima ( metastable states ) or saddle points ( unstable ) .",
    "microcanonical isothermal spheres are local maxima if the `` density contrast '' @xmath25 , otherwise they are at most saddle points of the entropy surface ; 4 .",
    "if @xmath26 lies in the range between @xmath27 and @xmath28 isothermal spheres have negative specific heat : in such states the system heats up and shrinks upon decreasing energy ; 5 .   finally , if @xmath29 ( i.e. at sufficiently low energies ) there are not even local entropy extrema .",
    "the standard interpretation @xcite is that , while at high energies an equilibrium configuration is achievable in the form of an isothermal sphere , below @xmath28 the system collapses to a dense core and overheats , following the negative - specific - heat trend to its extreme consequences .",
    "such a `` transition '' , occurring at the antonov _ point _",
    "@xmath30 , is known as `` gravothermal collapse '' or `` catastrophe '' ( see also @xcite for a more formal treatment of this transition ) .    in this work",
    "we extend the above theory to rotating systems , by including the effects of the angular momentum @xmath31 as a second conserved quantity besides @xmath17 , and discuss the thermodynamics and the corresponding equilibrium states ( which will now depend on both @xmath17 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "our work is motivated mainly by the crucial role rotation is expected to play in astrophysical systems on different scales such as globular clusters and the cores of elliptic galaxies , both of which can be modeled by ( [ ham],[pot ] ) .",
    "( hence our `` particles '' can be interpreted equally well as atoms and as stars . )",
    "a gravity - driven collapse can be seen as the prime cause for the equilibrium shaping of self - gravitating systems , both rotating and not .",
    "but the nature and the result of this collapse are expected to change significantly in the presence of rotation , and in particular for systems rotating sufficiently fast .",
    "rotating systems were tackled in the past by different models ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of the stability of rotating gaseous cylinders , and the more recent works @xcite and references therein ) , but a complete analysis of the antonov problem with angular momentum is still lacking .",
    "some progress was achieved recently for another class of systems where particles are assumed to obey a statistics that prohibits overlapping , the so - called lynden - bell statistics @xcite .    indeed",
    ", we will show that the above picture ( a)-(e ) holds with minor modifications for slowly rotating systems , that is when @xmath33 is sufficiently small .",
    "in particular , defining the reduced angular momentum @xmath34 , we identify an antonov _ line _ @xmath35 , with @xmath36 which plays in rotating systems the same role as the antonov point plays in non - rotating ones . for @xmath37 larger than a critical value @xmath38 , however , the collapse occurs not to a single dense cluster but to a double cluster ( a `` binary star '' ) , signaling a breaking of the ( axial-)rotational symmetry of ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , strictly speaking , for @xmath3 there is no antonov limit : double cluster solutions exist at all energies , albeit being locally unstable ( they are saddle points of entropy in the space of @xmath22 s ) .",
    "the lower the energy , the more dense and point - like the two clusters .",
    "we calculate the global phase diagram of the model in the @xmath39 plane and analyze the thermodynamics by studying the phase transition that take place and the caloric curves .",
    "the equilibrium density profiles obtained in the different regions of the phase diagram show that , depending on the values of @xmath26 and @xmath37 , the formation of `` rings '' , `` single stars '' , `` double stars '' and `` disk''-like structures is possible .    from a broad statistical mechanics viewpoint",
    ", it is well known that self - gravitating systems , and more generally systems with long - range interaction potentials more slowly than @xmath40 with @xmath41 in @xmath42 dimensions when @xmath43 .",
    "] , represent a subtle and delicate issue @xcite .",
    "for a recent critical discussion of the general statistical mechanics of non - trivial systems see @xcite .",
    "the main problem is that the usual thermodynamic limit @xmath44 for systems with potentials such as ( [ pot ] ) does not exist @xcite .",
    "their thermodynamics is evidently not extensive .",
    "now extensive systems necessarily have positive specific heat , but this need not be true for non - extensive ones @xcite .",
    "hence the canonical and microcanonical description of non - extensive systems do not necessarily coincide ( they do only in `` regular '' phases with positive specific heat , and in the dilute limit @xmath45 finite@xmath46 discussed at length in @xcite ) . in the most general and physically interesting cases , self - gravitating systems should be studied in the microcanonical ensemble , a circumstance that obviously introduces several technical difficulties which are amplified by the introduction of rotation .    the choice of boltzmann statistics , which is made by most authors @xcite , to describe the behaviour of particles contributes to complicate the situation further .",
    "the basic assumption is that all particles can eventually occupy the same point / cell in space , i.e. overlapping between particles is admitted . with boltzmann statistics ,",
    "_ the system ( [ ham],[pot ] ) has no ground state _",
    ", hence the entropy is not bounded .",
    "this is the ultimate origin of antonov s catastrophe , even ( as we shall see ) in rotating systems .",
    "clearly , if one wants to describe a system where newtonian gravity is the dominant macroscopic interaction then configurations with high particle density should be avoided , for at such short distances quantum effects and nuclear interactions become more important than gravity .",
    "one way around this problem is to introduce hard cores for particles .",
    "another substantially equivalent way is to use lynden - bell statistics @xcite instead of boltzmann s .",
    "we shall proceed as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we will expound our microcanonical mean - field theory , deriving the analogous of eq .",
    "( [ is ] ) for rotating systems . in sec .",
    "3 we will show results from the numerical solution of the new equation , and discuss in particular the phase diagram in the @xmath39 plane and the caloric curves .",
    "a comparison between the lynden - bell scenario discussed in @xcite and the boltzmann theory is presented in sec .",
    "4 . finally , we formulate our conclusions with some final remarks .",
    "the theoretical analysis of antonov s problem in a rotating framework can be carried out along the lines of the mean - field approximation described in @xcite , where the equilibrium properties of a self - gravitating and rotating system were studied assuming lynden - bell statistics for particles .",

    "the integral over momenta , namely @xmath49 can be calculated via its laplace transform ( integrals resulting from insertion of the integral representation of the @xmath50-function are at most of gaussian type , hence trivial @xcite ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the inertia tensor , with elements ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 and @xmath55",

    "if one is interested ( as we are ) in the large @xmath4 limit , one can keep only the terms of dominating order in @xmath4 in ( [ midd ] ) .",

    "the latter , however , do not display any serious qualitative difference from non rotating ones .",
    "the most interesting phenomena occur at high angular momenta , and in order to describe them it is necessary to include the dependence on @xmath100 .",
    "we thus write the solution of ( [ equa ] ) as @xmath102 where @xmath103 are real spherical harmonics and @xmath104 are their weights ( again functions of @xmath97 alone ) , which will have to be determined .",
    "clearly , this expansion differs from the one in legendre polynomials essentially for the terms with @xmath105 .",
    "we shall see that these terms are the ones that provide the relevant new physics at high angular momenta .",
    "using this expansion it is easy to show the following statements .",
    "the normalization @xmath93 is equivalent to @xmath106 so that the @xmath107 harmonics is ensures this condition .",
    "the coordinates of the center of mass are given by @xmath108 so that harmonics with @xmath109 are responsible for fixing the center of mass .",
    "it is convenient to set the latter in the center of the spherical box ( @xmath110 ) , which amounts to postulating @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",

    "@xmath113 while for the off - diagonal elements one gets @xmath114 in particular , one has @xmath115 so that this parameter , which will play a foremost role in the following analysis , only depends on the @xmath116 harmonics .",
    "using spherical harmonics as a basis set , for the newtonian potential one has @xcite : @xmath117 now it is easy to see that the so far unknown functions @xmath104 satisfy the following integral equation ( which can be found by multiplying both sides of ( [ equa ] ) by @xmath103 and integrating over angular variables ) : @xmath118 with @xmath119 despite their unfriendly look , eqs ( [ arra],[uh ] ) , which should be solved together in a self - consistent way , can be dealt with numerically .",
    "technical details are similar to those described in @xcite in relation to the lynden - bell statistics case , and we will skip them here . let it suffice to say that for the computation the series ( [ newta ] ) was truncated at the order @xmath120 and that all harmonics ( even and odd ) up to @xmath121 were included , except those with @xmath109 .",
    "notice that this does not imply a truncation of the expansion ( [ ser ] ) , i.e. the @xmath104 exist also for orders higher than @xmath121 .",
    "the effects of truncating the potential are well - known , and are discussed e.g. in @xcite . in short , when truncated at higher and higher order the series ( [ newta ] ) differs more and more from the real potential in a narrower and narrower region around @xmath122 , in a way that is reminiscent of the gibbs phenomenon .",
    "as we said , the angular momentum was taken to lie along the @xmath99-direction . in this setup ,",
    "solutions of ( [ equa ] ) were calculated as functions of @xmath123 and @xmath124 ; results of this analysis are given and discussed in the next section .",
    "the crucial quantity in the analysis that will follow is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 are the eigenvalues of the matrix , ordered assuming @xmath127 .",
    "the relevance of @xmath128 lies in the fact that it relates the thermostatistical equilibrium properties of systems in the microcanonical ensemble to the topology of the entropy surface in the space of conserved macroscopic quantities . in general",

    "@xmath133 has a convex part that is ignored by the canonical ensemble , which considers the concave hull of @xmath131 .",
    "the convex region corresponds to negative specific heat . for self - gravitating systems , ( [ hess ] ) provides a powerful characterization of some of the relevant quantities . in particular",

    "this is a straightforward generalization of the non - rotating case , where at the antonov point @xmath137 one has @xmath138 when two ( or more ) conserved quantities have to be taken into consideration , the above condition becomes a condition on the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath131 with respect to the conserved quantities . upon varying @xmath37 , the antonov limit",
    "@xmath35 describes a line in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "we call this line the antonov line",
    ".    _ phase coexistence .",
    "_ by virtue of the properties of ( [ hess ] ) , starting in the high - energy phase and decreasing @xmath26 at fixed @xmath37 one finds the beginning of a phase coexistence region when @xmath139 is fulfilled .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath140 the corresponding value of @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath140 the specific heat at constant @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , i.e. @xmath143 has a pole and changes sign ( from positive to negative ) upon decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "again , varying @xmath37 the point @xmath140 describes a line in the @xmath39 plane ( with @xmath144 ) , which separates a pure thermodynamic phase from a phase coexistence region .    _",
    "bifurcation to axially asymmetric solutions .",
    "_ for sufficiently high @xmath37 , solutions of ( [ equa ] ) without axial rotational symmetry ( `` binary stars '' ) bifurcate ( continuously ) from axially - symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "this bifurcation can be detected with the aim of the order parameter ( see ( [ armopar ] ) ) @xmath145 introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand that solutions with @xmath146 are axially - symmetric , while solutions with @xmath147 break axial rotational symmetry .",
    "if @xmath148 the system is necessarily isotropic ( @xmath149 ) and spherical symmetry can not be broken .",
    "this reflects the fact that the solution of ( [ equa ] ) depends only on @xmath97 , so that the series expansion ( [ ser ] ) is truncated after the first term , which involves only the @xmath150 harmonics .",
    "when @xmath151 , anisotropies may occur ( @xmath152 ) and one can have either solutions that are rotationally - symmetric around the @xmath99-axis ( @xmath153 or @xmath146 ) , which eventually depend on @xmath97 and @xmath154 to account for obvious rotation - induced distortions , or solutions that are asymmetric around the @xmath99-axis ( @xmath155 or @xmath147 ) .",
    "the latter must depend on @xmath97 , @xmath154 and @xmath100 , and correspond to double clusters .",
    "however , it turns out that such solutions appear only when @xmath37 is larger than a threshold value and @xmath26 is sufficiently low ( see also the discussion at the end of sec . 4 , and in particular fig .",

    "_ stability of the double cluster solutions .",
    "_ finally , we shall be interested in the local stability properties of double - cluster solutions ( high-@xmath26 , axially symmetric solutions are locally stable because in this limit the kinetic term of ( [ ham ] ) dominates and the system behaves more and more as an ideal gas ) .",

    "the marginal stability line marks the border between the region of the phase diagram where axially asymmetric solution are stable from that where they are at most metastable ( saddle points in the entropy surface ) . in principle , at the most general level the local stability analysis requires solving the eigenvalue problem for the kernel @xmath159 .",

    "when @xmath37 becomes larger than the critical value @xmath162 , however , the picture changes drastically . here",

    "it is important to stress that these results were obtained by truncating the potential via ( [ newta ] ) to order @xmath120 .",
    "while calculations performed with smaller @xmath121 in the lower half of the phase diagram ( @xmath2 ) gave essentially the same results , for high angular momenta we observed some dependence on @xmath121 , albeit weak . in particular , it is possible that upon increasing @xmath121 the marginal stability line is further inclined towards the @xmath140 line . as a consequence ,",

    "in summary , we have studied the equilibrium properties of a self - gravitating and rotating gas assuming that particles obey boltzmann statistics in space .",
    "the physical properties of this system can be understood easily as deriving from the balance of ( a ) kinetic and gravitational energy at low angular momentum , and ( b ) gravitational and rotational energy at high angular momenta . in case ( a )",
    ", the effects of rotation are basically negligible except for trivial distortions of the equilibrium shapes .",
    "if the total energy is sufficiently high so that the kinetic term dominates the gravitational one , the equilibrium state of the system is axially - symmetric and gas - like . at low energies , instead , gravitation induces the system to collapse into a dense core in a low - density gas . in case",
    "( b ) , the high energy regime is similar but at low energy rotation is strong enough to hinder the collapse into a single cluster and drive the system to organize into a double cluster structure ( a `` binary star '' ) .",
    "this simple , intuitive picture is confirmed entirely by our mean - field theory , which shows that in case ( b ) at least one main bifurcation ( from axially symmetric to axially asymmetric ) in the solutions of the basic eq .",
    "( [ equa ] ) occurs , and possibly many others can be found upon varying the conserved quantities @xmath26 and @xmath37 .",
    "our work leaves several directions for further research .",
    "the main question concerns probably the dynamics of these systems , which is an equally old @xcite and widely - discussed theme in astrophysics , see e.g. @xcite . among the many open issues and possible extensions for the equilibrium case ( such as the effect of different masses , see @xcite ) , we want to put forward the following few . first is the behaviour of the system left of the marginal stability line where double cluster solutions become unstable .",
    "( we mentioned in sec .",
    "3 that the location of this line turns out to depend on the maximum order of harmonics included in the calculation of the gravitational potential , @xmath121 .",
    "also the fact that no antonov limit exists for @xmath3 could be an effect of truncation . ) at low angular momenta , namely below antonov limit , no statistical equilibrium state exists and dynamical methods should be used to grasp the physics of the system ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "but for @xmath3 it is still possible to obtain ( unstable ) equilibrium states as saddle point of the entropy surface .",
    "this means that certain perturbations applied to such `` singular '' double - cluster structures ( highly concentrated ) will lead to an increase of entropy .",
    "it is not clear to us whether local entropy maxima ( metastable states ) exist in this region .",
    "definitely , there are no global maxima for @xmath131 is everywhere unbounded .",
    "this issue certainly deserves to be studied further .",
    "another important question that we did nt explore concerns the relevance of mass as a further conserved quantity .",
    "if @xmath4 is fixed , it should be treated on the same level as @xmath26 and @xmath37 , and this could lead to some qualitative changes in the picture presented here . as a final consideration , we stress the mean - field character of our solution . in spite of several claims being made of mean - field theory being exact for self - gravitating systems , we believe that it would be important to investigate the effects of particle - particle correlations , also at the merely quantitative level .                            o. fliegans and d.h.e .",
