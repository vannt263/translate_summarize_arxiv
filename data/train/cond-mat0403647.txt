    "an increasing body of experiments on macroscopic flow of various complex systems evidence spatially heterogeneous behaviour .",
    "we focus here on the ( large ) sub - class of such systems that display a macroscopic yield stress ( among which foams , suspensions , emulsions , colloidal glasses , ... ) .",
    "typically these systems flow homogeneously at large stress / shear rate , whereas at intermediate shear rate they may exhibit spatial coexistence between a flowing and a frozen region @xcite or intermittent heterogeneous flow @xcite . to this point",
    ", there is little insight as to whether the mechanisms leading to such macroscopic behaviours are generic or dependent on the specific microscopic structure of the fluid and the corresponding interactions .",
    "a general class of `` elasto - plastic '' models has been put forward to apprehend those macroscopic behaviour , which was first applied to seismologic modelisation @xcite . in these models , the medium first responds elastically to a global forcing ( either stress or strain ) .",
    "the deformation or stress can then locally induce a rearrangement or _ plastic event _ , if a local threshold is reached .",
    "such a plastic event locally relaxes a stress that is elastically redistributed in the medium , and can trigger other local events . in this picture , the macroscopic flow is the outcome of the collectively organized sequence of local rearrangements .",
    "although this mesoscopic description seems very reasonable , many questions remain to be answered for this scenario to be operational .",
    "first , what is ( are ) the basic plastic event(s ) , and how can it ( they ) be identified in a given flowing complex material ?",
    "second , what is the constitutive ( dynamic ) equation that describes such a single plastic event under a local forcing ?",
    "third , how does such an `` event '' , locally relaxing stress , perturb the surrounding medium ?",
    "the answer to this last question is obviously linked to the nature of the plastic event . as to the first two questions , _",
    "i.e. _ the nature and the description of the plastic event , various convincing pictures have been proposed in the literature . in a pioneering work ,",
    "bulatov and argon introduced a phenomenological description of a single plastic event , which allowed them to describe many properties of macroscopic plastic flows @xcite . in their simulation",
    ", the unit cell can undergo several fixed plastic deformations specific to their hexagonal geometry .",
    "later , on the basis of molecular simulations of a lennard jones glass under imposed shear stress @xcite , and building on earlier works by spaepen and argon , falk and langer introduced the notion of shear transformation zone ( stz ) , which described a local limited zone where rearrangements occur .",
    "the occurrence of very localized plastic events is most easily evidenced in foams @xcite , where they take the form of t1 rearrangements .",
    "langer @xcite then constructed an analytical `` mean field '' elasto - plastic model , introducing stz as zones with a plastic tensorial deformation .",
    "more recently , baret _ et .",
    "@xcite , and braun @xcite performed numerical simulations on lattices , in which a plastic event consists in a local scalar displacement occurring when the local stress reaches a yield stress .",
    "thus , within a very general class of elasto - plastic model , the notion and the description of a plastic event is now well documented and clarified . however , a clear description of the consequences of a localized plastic event on the stress distribution in the material ( third question ) still needs to be constructed .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper : using a rather general description for a localized plastic event , we compute the long - range _ elastic _ perturbation that such an event induces in an elastic material . we characterize its symmetry and amplitude , as well as the way it is modified if the event occurs close to a solid boundary .",
    "an _ a priori _ counter - intuitive result which emerges from our calculations , is the crucial role played by finite size effects in the modeling of flowing elasto - plastic materials .",
    "we limit ourselves here to the study of the elastic effects of a single event , and leave for a later report the analysis of the collective organization of the plastic events when the material is flowing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we specify the general  elasto - plastic \" model that we use : we assume that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic , as well as incompressible for simplicity . in section [ sec_infinite ] we consider an infinite geometry , and describe a local plastic event induced by shearing and the full characterization of the perturbation it elastically induces . in this case",
    "there is no difference between a forcing at imposed stress or imposed strain . in section [ sec_finite ]",
    ", we focus on finite size geometries , where the system is bounded by solid walls .",
    "first , we describe how a wall attenuates the perturbation induced by an event occurring in its vicinity .",
    "secondly , we explicit how in a finite size medium , the perturbation depends on the global forcing .",
    "we calculate the average stress relaxation induced by an event at imposed strain , and give explicit formulae to compute the corresponding stress field relaxation everywhere . in section [ sec_conseq ] ,",
    "we conclude and briefly highlight important consequences for the modeling of flowing systems .",
    "we assume , following many of the previously quoted studies , that the displacements and deformations are given by the simple superimposition of a plastic flow ( the localized plastic events ) and an elastic distortion of the medium .",
    "we further assume that the medium is homogeneous , isotropic , and linearly elastic .",
    "in addition , we focus for simplicity on the incompressible case ( the compressible case can be studied following the same lines ) , so that the elastic properties of the medium are fully described by the shear modulus @xmath0 .    denoting @xmath1 the total displacement vector at position @xmath2 , the strain tensor is given by @xmath3 . from our hypotheses ,",
    "this total strain is the sum of an elastic strain and a plastic strain ( non - zero only at the locus of plastic events ) : @xmath4 incompressibility corresponds to : @xmath5    with the hypotheses of linear elasticity and incompressibility , the total stress tensor is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pressure and @xmath8 verifies : @xmath9 as we have in mind the slow flow of pasty materials we neglect inertial effects so that mechanical equilibrium simply requires : @xmath10 we consider the classical situation where an applied shear ( either imposed deformation or stress ) induces elastic loading of the material , up to the point where it triggers a single localized plastic event .",
    "the consequent state of the medium in response to the applied forcing is here the sum of a purely elastic response to the forcing ( denoted with superscripts @xmath11 ) and of the perturbation induced by the occurrence of the plastic event ( denoted with superscripts @xmath12 ) .    with these notations :",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 describes the localized plastic event . to go any further we need to pay attention to the boundary conditions imposed on those fields , which brings us to specify the global geometry of the system .",
    "we start below with an infinite medium , before addressing finite - size effects in section iv .",
    "we start with the limit case of an infinite medium , where a driving at infinity imposes either an applied shear strain or an applied shear stress .",
    "the purely elastic response @xmath15 is homogeneous .",
    "let us then focus on the perturbation @xmath12 generated by a plastic event described by @xmath16 .",
    "if the system is stress driven , the boundary condition for the induced perturbation is : @xmath17 whereas for a strain controlled system , the boundary condition reads : @xmath18    equations ( [ incomp ] ) , ( [ elasticity ] ) and ( [ mech_eq ] ) can then be reformulated in a well defined problem for the perturbation field : @xmath19 which must be solved either with either ( [ bcinfty_stress ] ) or ( [ bcinfty_gam ] ) .",
    "obviously the problem at hand is directly related to the response of a purely elastic ( incompressible , isotropic , homogeneous ) system to a punctual force .",
    "let a force @xmath20 act on the medium at the position @xmath21 .",
    "the displacement field @xmath22 at position @xmath23 created by this force is given by : @xmath24 the solution of this system , that actually satisfies simultaneously both types of boundary condition ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , is the oseen tensor which is most easily dealt with in reciprocal space ( we use hats to denote fourier transforms ) : @xmath27 with : @xmath28 with this tool we can construct the solution to the system ( [ source_pl ] ) .",
    "this solution is clearly also independent of the specific boundary condition ( 6 ) or ( 7 ) , and can be simply written : @xmath29 at this point , no assumption has been made on the nature of the plastic event ( fully described here by the localized @xmath30 , or equivalently by @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore this expression gives in a very general form the displacement field induced by a plastic strain in an infinite medium ( for both type of boundary conditions ) . by derivation and using ( 3 )",
    "one easily obtains a similar formula in reciprocal space for the stress perturbation @xmath32 .",
    "both relations lead in real space to expressions for the propagators for displacement and stress respectively . rather than producing these formulae in a formal general context we specify to a given geometry first .",
    "+       direction at constant strain @xmath33 .",
    "the infinite system of section iii corresponds to @xmath34 and @xmath35,width=264 ]    to pursue analytically without dealing with opaque tensorial formulae , _ we now make the simplifying assumption that the local plastic event has the symmetry of the global forcing which we chose to be that of simple shear_. we further focus on the two dimensional case : the @xmath36 limit of fig .",
    "[ fig : cis2d_inf ] .",
    "we stress however that most our conclusions are also valid for the 3d situation ( see comments further ) .    with the hypothesis above , the plastic deformation tensor corresponds to simple shear @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are neglected .",

    ".,width=226 ]    the shear stress perturbation corresponding to ( [ dpt_gam ] ) can be obtained using ( 3 ) , and reads : @xmath47 somewhat similar formulae can be obtained for @xmath48 and @xmath49 but we will in the following mostly focus on the shear stress .",
    "we define formally the _ propagators _ @xmath50 , @xmath51 that describe the consequences in terms of displacement and elastic shear stress of a single plastic event in an infinite medium by : @xmath52 practically , the propagator for the displacement field can be derived from equation eq .",
    "( [ dpt_gam ] ) either with the fourier transform or by derivation in real space of the oseen tensor .",
    "the propagator for the shear stress is then deduced from linear elasticity . in the present two - dimensional geometry ,",
    "explicit formulae in reciprocal and real space are : @xmath53 hence , in a system forced with a symmetry of simple shear , the perturbation of the shear stress due to a localized plastic event is of quadrupolar symmetry ( see fig . [ lobe ] ) and decreases with a power law @xmath54 in two dimensions ( in three dimensional systems , the quadrupolar symmetry is conserved and the power law is @xmath55 ) .",
    "we now consider more global effects of the same localized plastic event @xmath56 , namely quantities integrated over a whole layer ( of constant @xmath57 ) .",
    "the following integral rules are easily derived from the previous calculations : @xmath58 the first equation states that the shear stress resulting from the plastic event is redistributed in such a way that the integrated stress on every layer is unchanged , i.e. there is no net release of stress over a layer , and consequently no change in the net force applied from above on the system !",
    "the second relation indicates that the average horizontal displacement in a ( horizontal ) layer depends only on whether it is above or below the event ( but not on its distance to the event ) , while the third equation expresses that the average vertical displacement over a layer is zero . for simple shear in three dimensions , similar equations",
    "hold for quantities integrated over planes perpendicular to the loading displacement gradient .",
    "let us now compare the results we have obtained at the end of section a , for the displacement and stress fields induced by a single localized plastic event of simple shear symmetry , to related studies in the literature .",
    "first , our results can be compared with the full analytical description of an elasto - plastic inclusion in an elastic matrix by eshelby @xcite . in that study ,",
    "plastic shear strain occurs only within the finite - sized inclusion which yields a perturbation of the shear stress around the inclusion .",
    "whatever the explicit shape of the inclusion , the long - range behaviour of that perturbation is strictly identical to the equivalent for the 3d case of expression ( [ propag_inf])(as we have checked ) .    to study collective effects , baret _ et al",
    "_ @xcite simulated elements with local yield stresses on a 2d - lattice ( semi - periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "in contrast with the present study , they modeled the plastic event by a simple scalar displacement . as a check , we computed the plastic strain tensor corresponding to such a local event in expression ( [ div_epspl ] ) , and calculated the corresponding perturbed shear stress .",
    "this yields a perturbation of dipolar symmetry , consistent with the propagator that they numerically evaluated on their lattice .",
    "this provides a validation of our procedure , but mostly underlines that the nature and symmetry of the elementary plastic event seriously affect the propagator describing its consequences , and therefore potentially the collective interplay of such events and the resulting macroscopic flow behaviour .",
    "we believe that the form of plastic event used in the present study is more suited for the actual description of the flow of elastoplastic materials .",
    "kabla and debrgeas @xcite performed an explicit numerical simulation of a two dimensional foam under shear strain . in their quasi - static procedure , at each step the length of the film is minimized at constant bubble volume .",
    "they mimic t1 event by reorganizing sets of four bubbles when film length decreases below a critical value .",
    "they studied the stress rearrangements following such t1 events in their simulation .",
    "averaging over many such events , they found that statistically these stress perturbations have a quadrupolar symmetry ( with a slight tilt of the axes with respect to those of the macroscopic shear ( _ x , y _ ) , probably due to a structuration of the foam by the flow into a slightly non - isotropic medium ) .",
    "they observed that this stress field coincides with that generated in an elastic medium by a set of dipoles with the orientation of the global forcing .",
    "what is remarkable is that the outcome of their cellular simulation is very consistent with the outcome of the ( elastic ) continuum approach followed here .    to describe the deformation of plastic amorphous materials",
    ", langer has introduced the concept of introduces shear transformation zones ( stz ) . in @xcite , he studies the response of a 2d material to an applied deviatoric stress .",
    "the plastic strain tensor is described without any assumption on its orientation .",
    "the results in that paper suggest that for a plastic strain tensor with the symmetry of the forcing , the deviatoric stress induced by the stz is of quadrupolar symmetry , with a power law decrease @xmath59 . within our model",
    ", we find for such an event also a quadrupolar symmetry but a power law decrease of @xmath54 , and do not understand this discrepancy .",
    "we now turn to the most important part of our paper , namely the effect of the finite - size geometry on the stress distortion due to a localized event .",
    "as in the analysis above , we consider here localized plastic events with the symmetry of the forcing ( simple shear ) , equivalent to a set of two dipoles of forces .",
    "therefore the propagator for such a plastic event can in principle be viewed as the sum of the propagators for the four forces , which brings us back to considerations pertaining to the green s function for the effect of a single force on the elastic _ finite _ medium .",
    "we focus on the case of an imposed shear strain represented on figure [ cis2d_fini ] , where two solid walls adhering perfectly to the medium are shifted horizontally .",
    "is applied to a two dimensional elasto - plastic medium .",
    "a plastic event occurs at position @xmath60 and is here represented by a square , and we seek for the elastic deformation of the rest of the medium that will add up on the elastic loading symbolized by the parallelograms.,width=302 ]    therefore the boundary condition for the total displacement field is : @xmath61 we proceed with the same decomposition as in the infinite medium case .",
    "the displacement field is the sum of the homogeneous elastic loading and of the perturbation due to the plastic event ( again we denote by @xmath62 the displacement and deviatoric stress tensor induced by the plastic event ) .",
    "the boundary condition for the perturbation in the imposed strain regime is : @xmath63 the total response of the elasto - plastic medium is then : @xmath64      we show here that the perturbation due to a plastic event occurring in the vicinity of a wall is more rapidly damped than the perturbation due to an elastic event occurring in the bulk .    to be precise , a plastic event is considered to occur in the vicinity of the bottom wall ( located at @xmath65 ) if it occurs at a position @xmath60 much closer to the wall than the point @xmath66 where the perturbation is calculated .",
    "this condition requires @xmath67 , with the notations defined on figure [ fig : wallevent ] .",
    "we also focus here on situations where the second ( top ) wall is too far to play a role , that is @xmath68 , so that our approach in this subsection practically deals with a semi - infinite geometry .    .",
    "the quadrupolar symmetry of the plastic event is assumed not to be affected by the presence of the wall .",
    ", width=264 ]    again , the effect of a plastic event is equivalent to the sum of that of the four forces represented on fig . [",

    "hence , we first study the displacement field induced by a single force @xmath69 at position @xmath60 in the vicinity of the wall .     in a semi",
    "infinite plane at a position @xmath60 is the sum of the displacement field the same force would induce at @xmath60 in an infinite medium , and that induced by its _ image _ with respect to the wall also in an infinite medium .",
    "the image consists of a punctual force @xmath70 , two dipoles of forces of strength @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , and two dipoles of potential .",
    "the resulting asymptotic long range behaviour is that of a quadrupole of strength @xmath71.,width=302 ]    the displacement field due to a punctual force @xmath69 at @xmath60 in a semi infinite medium is the sum of the displacement field due to the punctual force and an _ image _ with respect to the wall in an infinite medium .",
    "this complex image is such that the displacement field it induces exactly cancel out on the wall the displacement generated by the punctual force .",
    "its structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wallforce ] and recalled below @xcite .",

    ", width=264 ]    returning to the effect of a plastic event , where the source is now a set of dipoles as in figure 2 , one could expect a similar cancellation of the first order terms , and thus a far - field displacement scaling as @xmath84 .",
    "however inspection of the structure of the image show that such is not the case ( see figure [ fig : wallquadrup ] ) : the dipole of horizontal forces is duplicated in its direct image , and the set of dipoles of vertical forces it generates yield a dipole of strength @xmath85 .",
    "the contributions of the ( original ) dipole of vertical forces are weaker due to cancelations .",
    "altogether one is left with a dominant term that has the same geometry than in an infinite medium ( and a similar @xmath86 decay for the displacement ) with an amplitude twice as strong .",
    "we have analytically checked that the stress decay is consistent with the above picture , as for a localized event close to the wall we obtain a propagator that is directly related to its equivalent in the absence of the wall eq .",
    "( [ g4p2d ] ) : @xmath87 where clearly @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "this picture is also consistent with numerical calculations of the propagator for an event next to the wall in a finite geometry , which yields the picture in fig .",

    "we focus again on an imposed strain situation , and therefore on the problem corresponding to the system of equation ( [ source_pl ] ) together with the no displacement boundary conditions ( [ bc_finite ] ) .",
    "we indicate ways of calculating the propagator in this geometry but mostly emphasize consequences of a single event on integral quantities .      a first method to treat the case of a medium of finite thickness and infinite length , consists in the systematic construction of a series of images so as to cancel the displacements on both walls .    in the previous subsection we reported the explicit structure of the image of a punctual force needed to cancel the displacement due to this force on one of the walls .",
    "the image with respect to the wall at @xmath92 , unfortunately creates a displacement at the wall @xmath93 , so that its own image with respect to the wall @xmath93 has to be considered , and this process has to be repeated for every image . thus formally two infinite sums of images are required to express the displacement for a punctual force within two walls . following this strategy",
    ", pozrikidis @xcite performed a full analytical calculation of the deformation field induced by a point force .",
    "formally , the perturbation due to a plastic event can then be deduced by adding up the consequences of each of the four forces it consists of .",
    "this leads to expressions that although exact are heavy to deal with and somewhat opaque .",
    "we therefore turn to other methods in the following , focusing on a geometry periodic in the @xmath94 direction .",
    ".,width=302 ]    we now focus on a system of thickness @xmath90 and of finite extent @xmath91 in the @xmath94 direction , and consider periodic boundary conditions in that direction .",
    "this is equivalent to analyzing in an unbounded geometry the effect of a periodic array of plastic events of a given amplitude at positions @xmath95 with @xmath96 ( figure [ fig : cisperiodic ] ) , or formally @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting displacement field @xmath98 can then be viewed as the sum of the displacement field induced by a similar periodic array of plastic events _ in an infinitely thick medium _ @xmath99 and of a correction term @xmath100 due to the finite size @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath101 is a function of @xmath102 .",
    "the displacement field @xmath99 induced by the periodic array of plastic events in an infinite medium can be expressed using the propagator for a single event ( [ propag_inf ] ) : @xmath103 given its periodicity in the @xmath94 direction , this expression can be formally decomposed in fourier series : @xmath104 from equation ( [ eq_sum ] ) , the components of the zeroth - mode vector function are : @xmath105    the correction displacement field @xmath100 is the solution of incompressible linear elasticity with no source ( i.e. the set of equations ( [ elasticity],[mech_eq ] ) with no plasticity ) but with the boundary conditions required to grant that @xmath98 is zero on the walls : @xmath106 @xmath107 is thus also periodic and can be written : @xmath108 where the functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 can be calculated independently ( i.e mode by mode ) with the boundary conditions : @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",

    "a corollary is that a finite density of plastic events @xmath121 , will relax this total force by an amount @xmath122 , corresponding to a relaxation of the average stress @xmath123 independent of the size of the system .",

    "+ first step : we formally extend the actual system ( @xmath127 , and @xmath91 periodic along @xmath94 ) by the following two operations : first an antisymmetric image system is constructed that extends to @xmath128 , then the @xmath129 thick resulting system is repeated periodically in the @xmath57 direction . if the plastic strain in the original system is @xmath130 , our construction yields a system without walls that is @xmath129 periodic in the @xmath57 direction , with in the upper half period @xmath131 a plastic strain @xmath132 , and in the lower half @xmath128 an _ antisymmetric image _ plastic strain @xmath133 .",
    "this construction ensures that the overall displacement generated by these strains has an @xmath94 component that is symmetric by reflection by the planes @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and an @xmath57 component that is antisymmetric in the same operations .",
    "we have therefore generated a solution that satisfies the condition of a zero @xmath57 component of the displacement on the @xmath134 and @xmath135 planes ( loci of the walls in the original system ) .",
    "second step : we now want to cancel the remaining displacements along @xmath94 without modifying the above result , and without adding sources in the system @xmath127 .",
    "this can be achieved by adding on the planes @xmath134 and @xmath135 appropriate force fields @xmath136 directed along @xmath94 ( again asymmetric and @xmath129 periodic along @xmath57 ) . given the symmetry and periodicity of the system it is clear that the @xmath57 displacement on the walls is not modified by this addition .    )",

    "of course the force field @xmath136 in the above expression is itself proportional to the plastic strain ; the corresponding formulae are given in appendix [ sec_cal_wall ] .",
    "inverting back to real space allows to compute numerically the response to a localized event .",
    "we have checked that for a large system the stress created by a plastic event far from the walls according to this formula is close to that obtained analytically in section iii for an infinite medium .",
    "similarly , for an event directly neighbour to the wall , we recover the results of subsection iva for a semi - infinite medium .",
    "[ prop_wallint ] represents an intermediate situation : the event occurs in the vicinity of the wall .",

    "we have first calculated the corresponding perturbation in an infinite system forced with a symmetry of shear .",
    "the stress field is of quadrupolar symmetry and decreases with a power law @xmath54 in two dimensions .",
    "then , we showed that the stress field perturbation due to a plastic event occurring close to a wall has a modified near field structure but decays far away with the same law and pattern , although with an amplitude twice as large . eventually , we have proposed two ways of calculating the perturbation of the stress field due to a plastic event occurring in a finite medium .",

    "the extension of our results to a three dimensional situation is rather straightforward , and the qualitative statements are obviously similar .",
    "also we have focused on a scalar description of plastic strain and induced stress , but the same steps can be taken if one seeks to describe the whole tensorial stress field generated by plastic events of arbitrary symmetry . eventually , we have focused in section iv on a situation where the walls were kept fixed during the plastic event .",
    "the extension of our results to situations where the force on the plates is kept fixed is immediate : one simply needs to add to our solution a simple shear displacement ( corresponding to a stress @xmath144 with the notations of section iv ) .",
    "this study is meant to be a first step towards the modeling of the flow of an elasto - plastic material .",
    "the next one consists in plugging in a plastic law that describes the onset and evolution of the localized plastic events .",
    "coupling such a local plastic behavior to the long - range elasticity described here should yield interesting collective behaviours and hopefully insights in the flow mechanisms .",
    "for such an endeavour our quantification of finite - size effects is important for the steady - state average balance between the stress released by the plastic events and that imposed by the elastic loading .",
    "also the geometry and decay law of the elastic perturbation is to be considered when addressing the emergence of a collective / cooperative organization at low shear rates .",
    "important questions regarding possible spatial and temporal heterogeneities in such flows ( @xcite could be addressed at the light of the present results : + - we have shown that a localized plastic event relaxes the average stress but also modifies the stress pattern on _ all _ the lines of the system decreasing the stress of some elements but increasing that of others .",
    "does this allow shear banding with a limited zone flowing in coexistence with a non flowing region ?",
    "+ - the average stress released during an event of given strain amplitude is independent of the position of the event in the medium , and is the same on all lines . yet",
    "the geometry of the propagator is clearly modified by the proximity of a wall .",
    "do these elements favor a localization of the flow at the wall ?",
    "+ these questions will be addressed in a forthcoming publication .",
