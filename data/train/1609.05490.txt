    "f is therefore a key decoding step of the c - f scheme .",
    "the c - f decoding at relay nodes in @xcite is facilitated by the use of nested lattice codes built from construction a over the ring of integers , which ensures the integer linear combination of codewords also yields a codeword .",

    "even though an excess of points is generated for @xmath141 , this method is an efficient way of implementing this part of the algorithm for small number of users .",
    "the reason is that since every element of @xmath141 is used @xmath26 times to generate elements of @xmath135 , then for small @xmath26 the excess of points generated for @xmath135 is also small . for larger values of @xmath26 , using this imprecise method will lead to a larger amount of excess points for @xmath135",
    ". therefore it might be more computationally efficient to generate the exact values of @xmath141 without any additional excess points .",
    "one way to generate the exact points of @xmath141 is by iterating over the same two loops but adjusting the range of values searched in one loop based on the value selected in the other loop .",
    "for example , denote @xmath144 as the value selected by the loop generating real part of the discontinuity , and denote @xmath145 as the value generated by the loop representing imaginary values .",
    "we iterate the real value loop from @xmath142 to @xmath143 incrementing in steps of 0.5 , and for each value of the real loop @xmath144 , we iterate the imaginary value loop from @xmath146 to @xmath147 in steps of 0.5 .",
    "even though this leads to additional computational costs to generate the relevant values of @xmath141 , the overall complexity of generating @xmath135 and subsequent operations of evaluating @xmath96 will be lower for larger values of @xmath26 .",
    "our proposed algorithm can also be made more efficient by recognising that only one quadrant of @xmath135 needs to be evaluated to completely solve the minimization of @xmath95 .",
    "this is because discontinuities represented by @xmath135 has a rotational symmetry of four , and gaussian integer space also has a rotational symmetry order of four .",

    "plot , it s worth noting that even when step sizes are set to a minute level that pushes qes runtime to exceed the runtime of algorithm 1 , the qes will still return a noticeable amount of suboptimal coefficient vectors which is reflected in the slight gap from the optimal rate .",
    "another observation we make based on the data in figure  [ fig:4 ] is that as we fine tune the qes step size , the runtime increases significantly , yet the improvement in c - f rate diminishes considerably as qes approaches optimality .",
    "this can be observed by comparing the rate and cpu time for qes(magnitudestep=0.5 , phasestep=5@xmath248 ) and qes(magnitudestep=0.1 , phasestep=5@xmath248 ) where the improvement in rate performance is approximately 5% across all snr values , yet the cpu time increased by over 100% at 10db and over 300% at 20db .",
    "for @xmath247 transmitting users , by comparing the plots for qes(magnitudestep=0.5 , phasestep=5@xmath248 ) against plot for algorithm  [ alg : alg_1 ] , for snr of 10db it can be seen that algorithm  [ alg : alg_1 ] gives approximately 30% improvement in rate at the cost of 5 times the runtime of qes . at higher snr values",
    ", this trade - off becomes much worse , since the complexity of our proposed method increases exponentially with snr which is consistent with our analysis of its complexity at @xmath225 .",
    "nevertheless , even using minute qes step values that result in excessively long runtime , qes still returned non - optimal coefficient vectors for a large number of channel instances , as it does for the @xmath246 simulations .",
    "qes(magnitudestep=0.1 , phasestep=5@xmath248 ) provides near optimal rate performance at slightly lower complexity than algorithm  [ alg : alg_1 ] for smaller snr values . at higher snr ,",
    "the better efficiency of qes becomes distinctively larger .",
    "comparing qes(magnitudestep=0.5 , phasestep=5@xmath248 ) with qes(magnitudestep=0.5 , phasestep=1@xmath248 ) we note that runtime drastically increases with no noticeable change in rate , which again suggests there is a threshold on the extent altering the magnitude and phase steps can efficiently improve the performance of the qes for a specific set of channel parameters . using the numerical data available",
    ", we have found that for certain snr values it is not possible for qes to return 100% optimal coefficient vectors , even when its runtime exceeds that of algorithm  [ alg : alg_1 ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that while qes is a highly efficient and competitive search algorithm which can approach optimality at a much smaller computational cost than algorithm  [ alg : alg_1 ] , it can not guarantee to return the exact optimal coefficients for random channel instances , even when search steps are set to miniscule values . nevertheless , because the number of missed optimal coefficients is so small for detailed qes search steps , the overall loss can be made neglible , thus giving a very good trade - off between performance and complexity .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] illustrates the rate performance of each search method for c - f as @xmath26 increases while figure  [ fig:8 ] shows the corresponding cpu runtime .",
    "note that qes plots in figure  [ fig:7 ] and figure  [ fig:8 ] assume a fixed magnitude and phase step size which was selected to ensure qes performed at least on par with clll .",
    "we observe that the computational rate per user of c - f naturally decreases as @xmath26 increases due to increased interference between users .",
    "the performance of clll and qes both deteriorate with increasing @xmath26 in a similar manner .",
    "this is consistent with theory as the performance of clll is known to deteriorate at an exponential factor of @xmath83 as @xmath26 increases .",
    "the performance of qes deteriorates with @xmath26 for a fixed search step since this parameter should be adjusted to be gradually smaller with increasing @xmath26 in order to maintain optimality of search .",
    "how to adaptively select search step parameters to bring about optimal performance for the qes is still an open problem .",
    "however , due to the close relationship between qes and algorithm 1 , it can be conjectured that the qes search steps required to ensure optimal performance depends on the angle and euclidean distance between the two @xmath50 discontinuities of @xmath95 with the minimum euclidean distance from each other .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] shows the cpu time of the search algorithms as @xmath26 increases for snr of 10db .",
    "the runtime of algorithm  [ alg : alg_1 ] increases exponentially with @xmath26 as predicted by its theoretical complexity of @xmath225 .",
    "qes shows gradual increase in runtime with increasing @xmath26 due to the minimization function term ( [ eq10 ] ) which must be evaluated at a complexity of @xmath249 for each @xmath96 obtained in the iterative search . finally , even though clll has a theoretical complexity of @xmath250 , based on actual runtime performance , it is still very efficient because of the low computational complexity of each round of calculation",
    "in this paper , we proposed algorithms in low polynomial complexity to optimally solve the shortest vector problem that occurs in c - f over complex channels , for both the single receive antenna case and mimo c - f .",
    "the algorithms can be used to obtain the optimal equation coefficients for c - f over the ring of gaussian integers and the ring of eisenstein integers .",
