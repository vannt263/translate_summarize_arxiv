    "cold atoms trapped in optical lattices offer high degree of control over such factors as the interaction strength , level of disorder , and system geometry .",
    "this makes it possible to simulate , in a controlled fashion , various models of condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "bose  @xcite and fermi  @xcite hubbard models are among the studied ones , and spin-1/2 systems are receiving increasing attention  @xcite .",
    "another significant advantage of cold atom systems is their weak coupling to the environment .",
    "this makes it possible to study their nearly dissipation - free evolution for long times , which in turn has led to the renewed interest in the far - from - equilibrium dynamics of many - body quantum systems .",
    "several works have been recently dedicated to the formation  @xcite , dynamics  @xcite , and relaxation  @xcite of bound pairs ( bps ) of atoms that can exist even in the presence of repulsive interactions .",
    "they correspond to doubly occupied lattice sites and have been called doublons .",
    "doublons have been observed in bose  @xcite and fermi  @xcite hubbard models with short range interaction . when the interaction is strong , be it attractive or repulsive",
    ", an energy gap can emerge between the band of doublons and the band where each atom is on a singly - occupied lattice sites .",
    "this gap , together with the isolation of the system , results in the long lifetime of the bps in ideal systems . in some sense , this lifetime is even unexpectedly long .",
    "similarly , bps of parallel spins can emerge in spin-1/2 systems with strongly anisotropic nearest - neighbor interaction , commonly referred to as xxz models . in a spin chain where all spins point down due to a strong magnetic field , for example , two up - spins on neighboring sites",
    "form a long - lived bp .",
    "all realistic systems have defects .",
    "they can lead to scattering of bps .",
    "understanding the stability of bps in the presence of such scattering is therefore of central interest .",
    "for bps in spin-1/2 chains with a single on - site defect and large anisotropic exchange interaction , this problem was addressed in our previous articles @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend the analysis to doublons in one - dimensional bose - hubbard ( bh ) system and provide a comparison with the previous results .",
    "we also discuss the stability of bps against many - particle scattering in ideal atomic and spin chains .",
    "the presence of an atom on a lattice site in the bh model or of a flipped spin in the xxz chain is generally referred to as an excitation .",
    "we consider one - dimensional systems where the energy of the on - site positive hubbard interaction or the nearest - neighbor @xmath0 spin interaction largely exceeds the bandwidth of single - particle excitations . in the bh model ,",
    "the bandwidth is determined by the hopping integral , whereas in the xxz model it is determined by the in - plane spin coupling .",
    "this condition guarantees the energy separation of the bp band from the band of unbound two - particle excitations .",
    "we then analyze the case where the system has a site defect with an excess energy that also largely exceeds the bandwidth of single - particle excitations .",
    "such a defect would be expected to cause strong scattering of bps if a bp could resonantly decay into an excitation localized on the defect and a propagating excitation .",
    "this resonance can be achieved by tuning the defect site energy to a value close to the interaction energy .",
    "we show , however , that such inelastic scattering is largely suppressed .",
    "this is a consequence of destructive quantum interference .",
    "we also discuss the decay of bps in a defect - free chain .",
    "the goal is to understand what keeps the bps stable when they collide with each other  @xcite . in the anisotropic heisenberg model ,",
    "energy conservation allows two colliding bound spin pairs to decay into a bound three - spin state and an unbound spin excitation .",
    "we show , however , that such scattering is also strongly suppressed by destructive quantum interference . for the bh model ,",
    "energy conservation requires a multi - particle collision for the emergence of a bound triple of excitations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the two models analyzed are described in sec .",
    "[ secmodels ] .",
    "we consider strong interaction and a small number of excitations .",

    "[ twobps ] , we show that a two - bp state essentially does not couple with a bound three - excitation state , even though both scattering processes are allowed by energy conservation .",
    "the bps are almost elastically reflected from a defect site and from each other .",
    "we study one - dimensional systems with @xmath1 sites and periodic boundary conditions ( closed chains ) described by the bh and xxz models . in both cases",
    "we assume strong interaction and take @xmath2 .      in the bh model",

    "the hamiltonian contains only nearest - neighbor exchange with coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the ising - type interaction and @xmath26 is the flip - flop term  @xcite .",
    "we assume a large effective magnetic field , @xmath27 pointing up in the @xmath21 direction , so that the ground state has all spins pointing down , independently of the sign of @xmath23 .",
    "a spin pointing up corresponds then to an excitation .",

    "the defect - free system is integrable and can be solved with the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "it can also be mapped onto a system of spinless fermions  @xcite or hardcore bosons  @xcite . in the presence of a single defect with excess energy @xmath30 ,",
    "the system becomes chaotic , as attested by the wigner - dyson form of the level spacing distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , if the defect is very large , the system behaves as a chain with open boundary conditions , where the excitations move freely bouncing back and forth from the defect site . in this situation ,",
    "analytical studies are again viable .    in the next section , by combining perturbation theory and bethe ansatz , we derive analytically the eigenvalues and eigenstates for the trivial subspace of a single excitation , where the bh and xxz models are identical .",
    "it serves as an introduction for the sections where two excitations are considered .",
    "the basis vectors used are states where each excitation is on a single site .",
    "they are eigenstates of the interaction part of hamiltonians ( [ hambh ] ) and ( [ hamxxz ] ) , as for example , @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( [ hambh ] ) or equivalently @xmath33 for @xmath32 ( [ hamxxz ] ) .",

    "the band of extended bps lies inside the ( much broader ) band of loc - free states .",
    "one could then expect hybridization of the two types of states .",
    "in other words , a bp could approach the defect and resonantly scatter into an excitation localized on the defect and a propagating single excitation , or vice versa , a propagating single excitation could resonantly scatter off the excitation on the defect , and then the two excitations would move away from the defect as a bound pair . both scenarios",

    "physically , this means that once two bps approach each other , they are reflected before they become closer than two empty lattice sites .",

    "such state has become known as doublon . in the second system the bound pair corresponds to parallel spins placed on neighboring sites . for strong interaction , the bandwidth of bound pairs in an ideal chain is much smaller than the bandwidth of states with free excitations , so the bands of unbound and bound excitations are well separated .    of primary interest",
    "was the question of stability of the bound pairs in two possible decay scenarios .",
    "one refers to a chain with one bound pair and a single on - site defect .",
    "the energy of the defect can be tuned close to the interaction energy of the bound pair so as to allow energy conservation in the scattering of the bp off the defect .",
    "the second scenario refers to an ideal chain where the total energy of two bps is equal to the sum of the energy of a bound triple of excitations and the energy of a propagating single excitation , so that we might expect the bps to merge into a triple .",
    "our central result is the observation that , for strong interaction , both processes are suppressed .",
    "this is because there are two intermediate states that can mediate the decay process of the pairs and these states have essentially equal and opposite in sign amplitudes .",
    "such destructive quantum interference leads to the long - time stability of the pairs of bound excitations .",
