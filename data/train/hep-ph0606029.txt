    "it is well - known that effective field theories with four - fermion interaction ( the so - called nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) models ) , which incorporate the phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , are quite useful in describing low - energy hadronic processes ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since the njl model displays the same symmetries as qcd , it can be successfully used for simulating some of the qcd ground state properties under the influence of external conditions such as temperature , baryonic chemical potential , or even curved space - time etc .",
    "@xcite in particular , the role of the njl approach significantly increases , when numerical lattice calculations are not admissible in qcd , like at nonzero baryon density and in the presence of external gauge fields @xcite . in this way",
    ", it was observed in the framework of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional njl model that an arbitrary small external magnetic field induces the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) even at arbitrary weak interaction between fermions @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown that this phenomenon ( the so called magnetic catalysis effect ) displays a universal character and can be explained basing on the dimensional reduction mechanism @xcite ( for a modern status of the magnetic catalysis effect and its applications in different branches of physics , see the reviews @xcite ) .    as an effective theory for low energy qcd",
    ", the njl model does not contain any dynamical gluon fields .",
    "however , such a nonperturbative feature of the real qcd vacuum , as the nonzero gluon condensate @xmath0 can be mimicked by external chromomagnetic fields .",
    "in particular , for a qcd - motivated njl model with gluon condensate ( i.e. in the presence of an external chromomagnetic field ) and finite temperature , it was shown that a weak gluon condensate plays a stabilizing role for the behavior of the constituent quark mass , the quark condensate , meson masses and coupling constants for varying temperature @xcite .",
    "then , in a series of papers , devoted to the njl model with the gluon condensate , it was shown that an external chromomagnetic field , similar to the ordinary magnetic field , serves as a catalyzing factor in the fermion mass generation and dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry as well @xcite .",
    "the basis for this phenomenon is also the effective reduction of the space dimensionality in the presence of strong external chromomagnetic fields , and this does not depend on the particular form of the field configurations @xcite .    at present time , it is well - established ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the gluon condensate is a very slowly decreasing function of the baryon density ( baryon chemical potential ) .",
    "so in cold quark matter , it is a nonzero quantity even at sufficiently large baryon densities , which are expected to exist inside the neutron star cores .",
    "evidently , the consideration of the gluon condensate may change significantly the generally accepted picture of physical processes in the baryon matter . for instance , according to the modern point of view , the color superconducting ( csc ) phenomenon can be realized in neutron star cores ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "however , according to @xcite , the critical parameters of this phase transition strongly depend on the value of the gluon condensate ( in this case , only its chromomagnetic component survives ) .",
    "moreover , it turns out that even for a rather weak quark coupling , different external chromomagnetic field configurations induce the csc phenomenon @xcite . quite recently it was found that some combinations of external chromomagnetic and ordinary magnetic fields can penetrate into a bulk of the csc medium and modify its ground state , producing a new type of color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "finally , note that in the dense quark matter , a superstrong magnetic field is originated due to the presence of the gluon condensate @xcite . in conclusion , we see that there exist several new physical effects that are intrinsically connected with the gluon condensate ( external chromomagnetic fields ) .    in the present paper , we study the influence of an external chromomagnetic field on the pion condensation phenomenon .",
    "this phase transition can also occur in the dense baryon matter , although isotopic asymmetry , with different densities of up and down quarks , is needed for this process to take place .",
    "this type of quark matter was already investigated in the framework of njl type of models , both with and without pion condensation @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to investigate , in the framework of a njl model , the behavior of the quark and pion condensation in the presence of an external chromomagnetic field , modelling the gluon condensate . in particular",
    ", we will show that , even for a weak coupling of quarks , the pion condensation effect is induced by an external chromomagnetic field and is related to an effective dimensional reduction .",
    "the latter effect leads to a nonanalytic logarithmic dependence of the quark and pion condensates on the field strength in the strong field limit .",
    "for a system , composed of two flavored quarks , there exists the relation @xmath1 between the electric charge density @xmath2 , the baryon charge density @xmath3 and the density @xmath4 of the third isospin component @xmath5 .",
    "since these quantities are linearly dependent , we will study in the following the isotopic asymmetry ( which means that different species of quarks have different densities ) in dense quark matter with a nonzero baryon chemical potential @xmath6 . in this case , the chemical potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( where @xmath7 is the isospin chemical potential ) are independent parameters .",
    "note that in another possible case , i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( the last quantity is the electric charge chemical potential ) , they are no more independent , but related through the electric charge neutrality condition @xmath10 , if one assumes that quarks are in a weak - equilibrium with electrons , and the whole system is electrically neutral .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the first possibility , i.e. suppose that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are independent quantities . in our investigations",
    "we also suppose that @xmath6 is a rather small quantity . in this case , as well as at sufficiently high flavor asymmetry ,",
    "the color superconductivity effects may be neglected in favour of the normal quark matter or pion superfluidity effects ( see the recent discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a njl model of flavored and colored quarks @xmath11 with @xmath12 as numbers of flavors and colors , respectively ( for convenience , corresponding indices are sometimes suppressed in what follows ) , moving in an external chromomagnetic field .",
    "the underlying quark lagrangian is chosen to contain four - quark interaction terms responsible for spontaneous breaking of chiral and flavor symmetries .",
    "hence , two types of condensates might characterize the ground state of the model : the quark condensate @xmath13 ( spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ) , and the pion condensate @xmath14 ( spontaneous breaking of parity and isotopic symmetry ) .",
    "in particular , we consider a lagrangian which describes dense quark matter with an isotopical asymmetry , and we neglect diquark interactions and hence the possible formation of a diquark condensate . upon performing the usual bosonization procedure @xcite , @xcite and introducing meson fields @xmath15 , the four - quark terms are replaced by yukawa interactions of quarks with these fields , and the lagrangian takes the following form ( our notations refer to four  dimensional euclidean space with @xmath16  matrices in the @xmath17dimensional euclidean space with the metric tensor @xmath18 , and the relation between the euclidean and minkowski time @xmath19 : @xmath20 in what follows we denote the euclidean dirac matrices as @xmath21 , suppressing the subscript @xmath22 they have the following basic properties @xmath23 the charge conjugation operation for dirac spinors is defined as @xmath24 with @xmath25 we choose the standard representation for the dirac matrices ( see @xcite ) .",

    "] @xmath35 is their difference , and @xmath36 is the ( positive ) four - quark coupling constant .",
    "furthermore , @xmath37 is the covariant derivative of quark fields in the background field @xmath38 determined by the potentials @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the generators of the color @xmath41 group .",
    "finally , @xmath42 are pauli matrices in the flavor space .    evidently , the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) with nonvanishing current quark masses , @xmath43 , is invariant under the baryon @xmath44 symmetry and the parity transformation p. moreover , without the @xmath33-term , it is also invariant under the isospin @xmath45 group which is reduced to @xmath46 at @xmath47 . at @xmath48 and @xmath47",
    "the symmetry group of the initial model is @xmath49 ( here the subscripts @xmath50 mean that the corresponding group acts only on the left , right handed spinors , respectively ) .",
    "it is very convenient to present this symmetry as @xmath51 , where @xmath46 is the isospin subgroup and @xmath52 is the axial isospin subgroup .",
    "quarks are tranformed under these groups in the following ways @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in the case of @xmath55 the phase structure of the model ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is defined by the competition of only two condensates .",
    "one of them is the quark condensate @xmath13 , and the other is the pion condensate @xmath56 .",
    "if the ground state of the model is characterized by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then the axial symmetry @xmath52 of the model is spontaneously broken down , but isospin symmetry @xmath59 and parity p remain intact . however , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then only parity p and the isospin symmetry are spontaneously broken down and the pion condensed phase is realized in the model . as a consequence , in the last case we have @xmath62 ,",
    "i.e. , a nonzero difference in densities of up and down quarks arises ( isotopic asymmetry of the ground state ) . generally speaking ,",
    "the inverse is not true , i.e. ,",
    "if there is an isotopic asymmetry of quark matter , this does not necessarily mean that pion condensation phenomenon does occur .    in order to investigate the possible generation of quark and pion condensates in the framework of the initial model ( [ 1 ] ) ,",

    "a ) * and * b ) * , the following preliminary conclusions can be made .",
    "it is clear that at very small values of the coupling constant @xmath36 , i.e. at @xmath265 , and for @xmath266 , both the isotopic and the chiral symmetry of the model ( [ 1 ] ) are not broken down at @xmath199 , and quarks are massless particles ( recall , we consider only the case with zero current quark mass ) .",
    "however , if an external chromomagnetic field @xmath267 is present ( and it is rather strong in our analytical consideration ) , then the effective potential ( [ muuu ] ) of the system acquires a nontrivial global minimum point which lies on the @xmath124-axis and has the form @xmath268 , where @xmath229 is the solution of the stationarity equation ( [ eqv ] ) .",
    "this means that in this case a nonzero pion condensate @xmath269 is generated by an external chromomagnetic field ( chromomagnetic catalysis of the pion condensation ) , and the isotopic symmetry @xmath270 of the model is spontaneously broken down ( see the text after ( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , since the expression for the effective potential in this case resembles the effective potential in the 2-dimensional gross ",
    "neveu model , one can say that this effect , similar to the magnetic catalysis phenomenon , is provided by the dimensional reduction mechanism .    let us present some numerical calculations in the next section , in order to support this conclusion .",
    "consider first the case of a zero external field @xmath271 , and flavor symmetric medium @xmath201 .",
    "moreover , the temperature and bare quark mass @xmath272 are taken to be zero throughout the present section .",
    "the numerical analysis of the behavior of the effective potential ( [ muuu ] ) , which is just the thermodynamic potential @xmath273 for @xmath118 , was performed for the value of the coupling constant @xmath163 gev@xmath164 , taken from @xcite , and for the quark chemical potential @xmath274 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u2 ] ) . in this case",
    "the quark energy spectrum is symmetric with respect to @xmath71 and @xmath124 , i.e. the function @xmath275 depends only on the single variable @xmath276 .",
    "hence we draw the effective potential as a function of only one variable , e.g. , @xmath71 . in this figure",
    ", the picture on the left corresponds to the value of the cutoff parameter @xmath277 gev ( in this case @xmath278 ) , whereas the right picture corresponds to @xmath279 gev ( @xmath280 ) .",
    "the figure demonstrates the general feature of the effective potential at @xmath201 and @xmath281 .",
    "namely , if the effective coupling constant @xmath282 is sufficiently small , @xmath283 , then the global minimum point of the effective potential is at the origin , and the chiral symmetry is not broken ( left picture ) .",
    "however , if @xmath284 , the effective potential has a nontrivial global minimum , and the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down ( right picture ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath275 on the two variables @xmath71 and @xmath124 ( @xmath280 ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : u3c ] for @xmath274 .",
    "the picture is evidently symmetric , as it should be in this flavor symmetric case .",
    "it is also necessary to note that if @xmath284 , then at @xmath281 and @xmath266 a nonzero pion condensate appears in the model ( [ 1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "( in this case , the isotopic symmetry @xmath46 is broken down ) . however , if @xmath283 , then at @xmath281 and arbitrary values of @xmath33 , including zero , the symmetry of the njl model ( [ 1 ] ) remains intact .    now , in order to present numerical arguments in favour of the chromomagnetic catalysis of pion condensation , we will study the effective potential @xmath275 ( [ muuu ] ) at @xmath266 and suppose that @xmath285   gev@xmath286 ( this value of @xmath161 mimicks the nonzero qcd gluon condensate @xcite ) . since the current quark mass @xmath272 is equal to zero , the nontrivial stationary points of the function ( [ muuu ] ) lie either on the @xmath71 or on @xmath124 axis ( see the remark following formula ( [ qqq ] ) ) .",
    "thus , in order to find the global minimum point of the effective potential ( [ muuu ] ) , it is enough to consider the behavior of @xmath275 along the coordinate @xmath71 and @xmath124-axis only .",
    "the corresponding curves are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : u4a ] for @xmath287   gev , and physical values of @xmath163 gev@xmath164 and @xmath279 gev ( in this case @xmath288 ) .",
    "they demonstrate that , although a nontrivial stationary point of the thermodynamic potential @xmath289 at @xmath118 does exist on the @xmath71-axis in a chromomagnetic field @xmath161 ( and this is just a saddle point in this case ) , the value of the effective potential at the other stationary point , @xmath290 , is slightly deeper .",
    "our calculations indicate that with growing @xmath33 the difference between the minima of the curves for @xmath291 and @xmath292 increases , and the very minima get deeper . the comparison of the results obtained with the known results at zero background field , demonstrated that the background field deepens the minimum for the pion condensate .",
    "moreover , we formally considered the interesting case of a smaller value of @xmath184 , corresponding to @xmath283 .",
    "the calculated effective potential then has a minimum at a nontrivial value of @xmath229 for weak coupling of quarks for @xmath293 , as well .",
