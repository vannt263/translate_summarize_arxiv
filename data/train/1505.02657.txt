    "in addition , the total value of the maximum optical density can also be strongly influenced by the renormalization of tunneling in the effective time - averaged floquet picture for small @xmath298 . while for the excitation spectra shown in fig .",
    "a value of @xmath302 was chosen , the spectra can be easily compared by normalizing the four data sets . for the quantitative comparison of spectra obtained for different driving amplitudes and , hence , different effective tunneling amplitudes as in fig.[fig3 ] , however , normalization of each single spectrum is not a valid approach . for this reason ,",
    "a large number of @xmath297 pixels has been included in the calculation of the maximum optical density in fig .. here , the obtained data yields comparable results even for the zero - crossing of the effective tunneling at @xmath303 .    despite the stark difference between the number of included pixels in the spectra of figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ,",
