    "one of the oldest problems in laser physics is the characterization of the quantum - limited laser linewidth . in their seminal paper on the theory of the laser , schawlow and townes derived the formula @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the frequency of the laser mode , @xmath3 is the linewidth ( fwhm ) of the corresponding passive cavity resonance , and @xmath4 is the output power .",
    "several corrections to this result were found by subsequent researchers : ( i ) an excess noise factor arising from incomplete population inversion in the gain medium ; ( ii ) the petermann factor , which describes excess noise due to mode non - orthogonality @xcite ; ( iii ) the henry @xmath5 factor , which describes indirect phase fluctuations from instantaneous intensity changes caused by spontaneous emission @xcite ; and ( iv ) a `` bad - cavity '' factor which reduces the linewidth when the cavity decay rate is on the order of the gain width @xcite .",
    "the first three factors all broaden the linewidth relative to the basic schawlow - townes result , eq .",
    "( [ omegast ] ) .",
    "the bad - cavity factor , however , _ reduces _ the linewidth .",
    "its origin was originally attributed to the slowdown of phase diffusion caused by atomic memory @xcite ; subsequently , kuppens _",
    "_  gave an alternative interpretation based on the increase in the laser cavity s group refractive index due to the frequency dispersion of the gain medium @xcite .",
    "this factor deviates significantly from unity in bad - cavity lasers , whose cavity decay rates are on the order of the gain width ( or polarization dephasing rate ) , and has been demonstrated experimentally in a hene gas laser @xcite .",
    "it has also recently been re - derived in the context of quantum cascade lasers , where it yields a small but measurable correction to the linewidth @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been theoretical proposals to achieve ultra - low linewidth lasers by exploiting this effect with superradiant gain media @xcite .",
    "recently , two of the present authors developed a theory of the quantum - limited laser linewidth @xcite , based on the properties of the scattering matrix ( @xmath0 matrix ) derived from steady - state ab - initio laser theory ( salt ) @xcite . according to this theory , the cavity decay rate @xmath3 in eq .",

    "the quantity denoted @xmath11 is the usual hermitian norm of this vector , which will be set to unity by convention .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the biorthogonal norm of @xmath9 , a complex number with modulus less than or equal to unity .",

    ", we analyze the @xmath0-matrix linewidth formula further , and derive additional results which flow from it .",
    "we show that eq .",

    ", we analyze a one - port laser ( e.g. a fabry - prot single - mode laser ) , for which the @xmath0-matrix can be completely described in terms of the poles and zeros positions .",
    "this leads , in sections [ petermann section ] and [ bad cavity section ] , to a simple geometric interpretation of the petermann and bad - cavity factors in terms of the motion of the poles and zeros of the @xmath0-matrix in response to the pumping of the gain medium . for more general lasers , including non-1d and/or spatially non - uniform lasers",
    ", the full @xmath0-matrix theory allows for a more rigorous calculation of the linewidth . in section [ wavefunction formulation ] , we use the @xmath0-matrix theory to derive an alternative formula for @xmath17 in terms of the lasing wavefunction , and show that the bad - cavity linewidth reduction factor is automatically incorporated .",
    "by contrast , the bad - cavity factor was derived in refs .   using langevin equations , in which the spatial variation of the lasing mode is neglected , and in ref .   using a green s function method specific to 1d cavities . for fabry - prot cavities ,",
    "we show analytically and numerically that our theory reduces to the earlier results . in section [ numerical section ]",
    ", we present numerical analyses of more complex lasers , including spatially non - uniform 1d cavities and 2d cavities . when spatial hole - burning and line - pulling ( due to the frequency dispersion of the gain medium ) are negligible , the @xmath0-matrix theory is in good agreement with previous , more approximate theories , where the bad - cavity factor and petermann factor are treated as independent quantities . in the presence of strong line - pulling or spatial hole - burning ,",
    "we find that this factorization breaks down . the deviations in the linewidth predicted by the @xmath0-matrix theory , under these more general conditions , can be tested in future experimental work .",
    "possibly the most - studied correction to the schawlow - townes linewidth formula is the petermann factor , which accounts for the fact that the modes of any open system , including laser cavities , are non - orthogonal .",
    "when spontaneous emission noise is decomposed into these non - orthogonal modes , there is an excess in the overall noise level associated with noise correlation in different modes @xcite .",
    "this effect was originally discovered and discussed in the context of transverse modes of gain - guided lasers @xcite , and subsequently extended to longitudinal modes by hamel and woerdman @xcite .",
    "the petermann factor is written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is either a transverse or longitudinal wavefunction ( mode amplitude ) , and the integral is , correspondingly , either taken over the area transverse to the axis of the laser cavity or along the axial direction .",
    "the methods which have previously been used to derive the petermann factor @xcite are limited to 1d lasers with a well - defined axis , and with spatially uniform dielectric functions .",

    "recently , schomerus has derived a generalization of the petermann factor which applies to sub - threshold high - q 2d lasers @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the relationship between our results and those of schomerus in section [ wavefunction formulation ] .    in this section ,",
    "we develop a simple and intuitive interpretation of the petermann factor , based on the analytic properties of the @xmath0-matrix . in the next section",
    ", we will see that the bad - cavity linewidth reduction factor also emerges in this picture .",
    "the important role of dispersion in reducing the linewidth was noted in ref .  , but in a less complete manner , as we did not then appreciate its connection to the bad - cavity factor in fabry - prot systems .",
    "the geometric interpretation of the petermann factor was also touched upon in a recent work on the bandwidth of coherent perfect absorption @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering a one - port laser , such as a 1d cavity with a perfect mirror on one end , or a higher - dimensional cavity with a single - mode port . in this case",
