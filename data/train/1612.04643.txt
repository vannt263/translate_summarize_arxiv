    "all traversable wormhole geometries known so far can be roughly divided by their topological properties into two classes .",
    "the first class describes the so - called inter - universe wormholes .",
    "a typical example is a spherically - symmetric wormhole consisting of two asymptotically flat spacetimes connected by a common throat .",
    "the throat is the only causal connection between these asymptotically flat universes .",
    "the second class includes the so - called intra - universe wormholes . for these wormholes",
    "the throat causally connects two regions of the same universe . in a genuine intra - universe wormhole",
    ", these regions can be also connected by causal paths which are not threaded through the throat .",
    "embedding diagrams of such wormholes have form of `` handles '' . of course",
    ", one can effectively turn these wormholes into their inter - universe siblings by taking large distance between mouths thereby sweeping under the rug all effects related to the non - trivial topology .",
    "according to the above classification almost all known wormhole solutions belongs to the first class , and only a small group conform with requirements for genuine intra - universe wormholes . among them , for example , models constructed in  @xcite . nevertheless , despite the scarcity of exact solutions , physical effects in abstarct intra - universe wormholes",
    "were studied  @xcite . in particular , as it was shown that causality violations can occur in such spacetimes .    in the present paper we are going to describe two more exact solutions of intra - universe wormholes in general relativity .",
    "they are inspired by the model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this wormhole was constructed from a reissner - nordstrm  ( rn ) solution and a specific majumdar - papapetrou  ( mp ) solution by using the thin shell formalism  @xcite .",
    "the mp  solution describes static gravitational field of two charged spheres .",
    "electric and gravitational potentials are constant on spheres .",
    "this crucial feature allows a continuous matching with the  rn spacetime .",
    "in the rn  part black and white holes are causally connected .",
    "they constitute a timelike `` handle '' for the wormhole and necessarily leads to causality violations in the resulting spacetime . then by joining the rn region with the  mp  spacetime across its two spheres one turns worldtubes of these spheres into thin shells . by construction ,",
    "transitions through the resulting wormhole are one - way since one must cross horizons",
    ". another distinctive feature of this spacetime is that all energy conditions can be satisfied . using the terminology of  @xcite",
    ", such wormholes will be dubbed `` timehole '' .",
    "note in passing , that there exist alternative wormhole models based on the system of connected black and white holes .",
    "for instance , the model of inter - universe wormhole proposed in  @xcite belongs to this class .",
    "it appears that the approach of  @xcite can be used to construct at least two new solutions . in particular , in section  [ sec : th ] a cosmological extension of the aichelburg - shein timehole is constructed .",
    "it becomes possible since there exist cosmological analogs of  mp solutions , the so - called kastor - traschen  ( kt ) spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "then a kt  solution exists which describes the outer gravitational field of two charged spheres comoving in an expanding universe . on the other hand , kt  solutions are reduced to reissner - nordstrm - de sitter  ( rnds ) spacetimes in the case of spherical symmetry .",
    "this fact is of importance in subsection  [ sec : junc ] where we consider a junction of the corresponding kt  spacetime with a rnds wormhole by virtue of thin shells .",
    "this junction gives a cosmological timehole , i.e. it is again a one - way wormhole where the null energy condition can be satisfied .",
    "moreover , likewise the static timehole , causality violations can also occur in this model .",
    "however at this stage , causal properties of the timehole are mostly obscured by the lack of knowledge about causal structure of the  kt  region .    in subsection",
    "[ sec : kt ] a qualitative study of the causal structure of the  kt  region is given . since the corresponding kt  solution is axially symmetric , we try to deduce its causal structure by studying null geodesics propagated either along the axis of symmetry or in the middle plane between spheres .",
    "essentially the same idea was used in  @xcite for the two centered  kt spacetime .",
    "however , the technique of  @xcite can not be directly applied in our case .",
    "we extract the behaviour of geodesics from properties of a specific second order  ode .",
    "in particular , it is possible to identify generators of horizon from solutions of this  ode .",
    "this analysis suggests that shells are enclosed by common inner and white hole horizons during the evolution .",
    "however , cosmological horizon is splitted in the course of expansion thereby causally disconnecting shells .    in section  [ sec : swh ] static wormhole geometry supported by a ghost scalar field are considered . in the case of general relativity minimally coupled to the ghost field , there also exists analog of mp  solutions  @xcite . on the other hand , spherically",
    "symmetric wormholes exist in the theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , to build the intra - universe wormhole we can follow essentially the same procedure as in section  [ sec : th ] .",
    "here however , there is an additional subtlety .",
    "the thin shell formalism requires the continuity of the ghost across shells .",
    "then the wormhole can be constructed in the form of its universal cover .",
    "this in turn , allows to treat the ghost filed as a phase of some complex scalar field .    in section  [ sec : end ]",
    "some concluding remarks are given .",
    "appendix  [ sec : ap0 ] contains supplementary results for subsection  [ sec : kt ] from the theory of second order odes .",
    "they are required for estimation of root numbers in solutions of  .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the signature   and the units where  .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the key element of the aichelburg - schein timehole  @xcite is an outer spacetime of two charged ( non - intersecting ) spheres @xmath0 of equal radii  @xmath1 which are held in equilibrium by a balance between gravitational attraction and electrostatic repulsion .",
    "more precisely , the corresponding solution of the einstein - maxwell equations is the  mp  spacetime @xmath2 where @xmath3 are cartesian coordinates and @xmath4 is a solution of laplace s equation in these coordinates i.e. @xmath5 with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath6 therefore continuous junction of spherically - symmetric solutions becomes possible along spheres  @xmath0 .",
    "this also suggest an obvious way to get a cosmological analog of the aichelburg - schein timehole .",
    "namely , we can try to replace the  mp solution   by the corresponding kt  spacetimes .",
    "the kt  metrics are solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations with a positive cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "they describe extremely charged masses comoving in a spatially flat expanding or collapsing universe . respectively ,",
    "the rn region of the original model should be replaced by a  ( rnds ) one . hereafter in this subsection , we will label quantities in kt and rnds regions by  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 respectively whenever it is necessary .",
    "then we are interested in the  kt  solution which gives the outer gravitational field of two charged spheres  @xmath0 of equal radii  @xmath1 . in cosmological",
    "coordinates its line element  is    [ kt1 ] @xmath9    where @xmath4 is the solution of , we are going to borrow from @xcite .",
    "we will consider only   branch  of  , i.e. cosmological expansion .",
    "following @xcite we place centers of spheres on the z - axis at @xmath10 and put @xmath11 in the dirichlet boundary condition  .",
    "the parameter  @xmath12 is related to the mass of the kastor - traschen region .",
    "there are two representations of  @xmath13 . on the one hand , due to the symmetry of the problem ,",
    "it is convenient to use bispherical ( toroidal ) coordinates  , see  e.g.  @xcite .",
    "their relation with cartesian coordinates are as follows    @xmath14    where  @xmath15 is yet an arbitrary constant . in the bispherical coordinate system , spheres  @xmath0",
    "are given by simple equations   and @xmath16 then taking into account   one can explicitly write solution   as follows    [ kt2 ] @xmath17\\label{omega1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the potential  @xmath4 in square brackets was obtained in  @xcite by the method of images and each term in the series is simply potential of a particular image . therefore can be also written  as @xmath18 where  @xmath19 is the unit vector along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "another part of the cosmological timehole will be a region of the rnds spacetime with  .",
    "note that non spherically - symmetric kt solutions are known only in the form .",
    "thus , joining with the rnds region has to be carried out in cosmological coordinates . in these",
    "coordinates the rnds with is @xmath21 i. e. a spherically - symmetric kt  spacetime .",
    "cosmological coordinates in do not cover the whole spacetime manifold .",
    "it can be seen from the corresponding carter - penrose diagrams  @xcite . in particular ,   shows a complete rnds manifold when   and  . in this case ,",

    "some derivatives of the riemann tensor blow up at the horizon .",
    "this is a common feature for all non spherically - symmetric kt  spacetimes , see   for details .",
    "let us summarise the results .",
    "likewise the model of  @xcite , the obtained timehole is traversable in the sense that the rnds region contains causally connected black and white holes as it is seen from  .",
    "however , the cosmological timehole is _ dynamical _ since the shells are expanding in contrast with the static solution of  @xcite .",
    "another difference from the static model is the constraint on the type of matter composing the shells .",
    "this result is in accordance with conclusions obtained in  @xcite within alternative approach to multi - shell systems in kt spacetimes .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that two kt spacetimes can be only matched across dust shells .",
    "thus the results of this section gives the following still incomplete picture of the cosmological timehole .",
    "initially only the  rnds  spacetime exist .",

    "after some time , another shell @xmath60 emerges from singularity @xmath78 . in",
    "the  kt  region shells emerge from singularities simultaneously at time  @xmath79 which is defined from  .",
    "such a behaviour suggest that causality violations may also arise in the model at hand .",
    "likewise the static timehole , there exist timelike curves from the arbitrary future of  @xmath59 to the arbitrary past of  @xmath60 in the rnds region .",
    "causality violation appears if we are able to causally close these curves through the kt region . at this stage , it is not clear whether it is possible .",
    "it also expected that , if exists , the resulting time machine can not be eternal since the cosmological expansions will eventually turn it off by causally disconnecting shells .",
    "these ambiguities require more deeper understanding of the causal structure of the spacetime  .",
    "information about causal structure of the kt region can be extracted from the behaviour of null geodesics .",
    "again , we choose coordinates where spheres are centered at   and   are respectively crossing points with shells  @xmath59 ,  @xmath60 .",
    "symmetries of the solution suggest that there exist straight light rays propagated either along @xmath20-axis or in radial directions on the middle plane between shells .",
    "first of all we consider axial null geodesics . then , indeed , by putting , and taking into account that and one turns the geodesic equation into a system of two odes for two functions , of affine parameter  @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",

    "all signs swap their meanings to opposite when  @xmath87 .",
    "now , using  ,  , the @xmath44-component of the geodesic equation becomes identically zero , while integration of the @xmath20-component gives @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 are integration constants .",
    "thus the function  @xmath85 defines a map of the affine parameter line into the @xmath20-axis .",
    "further , we can calculate the expansion of the axial null congruence . by using   and",
    ", tangential vector field can be written as @xmath91 a transversal vector field is defined by the condition @xmath92 and has the form @xmath93 again `` + '' is for outgoing and `` - '' for ingoing geodesics .",
    "then the expansion is calculated as follows  @xcite @xmath94 where the overdot is the derivative with respect to @xmath80 and integration constants are absorbed into @xmath95 .",
    "the expansion is infinite and   at conjugated points  @xcite .",
    "however , generators of horizons are special in this respect since they have no conjugate points and therefore @xmath96 must be bounded .    now , since   is defined through  , it is possible to deduce the causal structure directly from the behaviour of @xmath85 by virtue of the following heuristic rules :    1 .",
    "the condition @xmath41 defines singular boundaries for every spacelike hypersurface   as equipotential surfaces of @xmath4",
    ". then   defines moment of time when the point @xmath20 emerges from singularity .",
    "evidently , segments of  @xmath85 will have physical meaning only when the corresponding   in  .",
    "this implies the first rule : _",
    "@xmath85 , @xmath97 must have different signs for outgoing and the same signs for ingoing light rays .",
    "_ let @xmath98 , @xmath99 then intervals @xmath100 and @xmath101 are causally disconnected by cosmological horizon .",
    "_ indeed , in this case there are two branches of @xmath81 in the vicinity of @xmath102 . by rule",
    "( i ) the physical branch is defined by @xmath103 . at the same time ,   and   suggest that @xmath104 when @xmath105 and @xmath96 is bounded for all @xmath80 and therefore such a geodesic is a generator of cosmological ( particle ) horizon .",
    "3 .   _ a light ray meet a singularity at @xmath106 if @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "_ + if @xmath85 has an extremum at @xmath106 then from  , we have   i.e. @xmath109 . also , according to   the affine parameter has a finite value at @xmath106 .",
    "thus indeed , the null geodesical incompleteness takes place there . while by construction ,   is regular across @xmath106 , rule  ( i ) defines the corresponding segments of  @xmath85 unambiguously .",
    "let us note however , that if   then signs of @xmath85 , @xmath97 may remain the same across  @xmath106 .",
    "in this special case , both segments of @xmath81 may have physical meaning .",
    "let us consider degenerate case @xmath107 , @xmath110 .",
    "by virtue of the lhopital s rule along with   one obtains @xmath111 i.e. limit exists if r.h.s .",
    "is non - negative .",
    "if r.h.s is zero then there is a singularity at  @xmath112 .",
    "however ,   and   shows that @xmath113 at  @xmath106 and @xmath114 is bounded for all  @xmath80 .",
    "_ thus if  @xmath106 is finite , the corresponding geodesic is either a generator of past cauchy horizon ( @xmath104 ) or future cauchy horizon ( @xmath115 ) with an end point at  @xmath112 .",
    "the hypersurface  @xmath116 has an edge according to  .",
    "if  @xmath106  is infinite then the behaviour of generators in the vicinity of point  @xmath29 at   is reproduced .",
    "_    note that the potential @xmath4 in question is regular in its domain .",
    "thus solutions @xmath85 are also regular . for @xmath4 with poles the above rules should be amended .    at this stage , it is instructive to make a digression and test the rules first for a rnds spacetime in cosmological coordinates .",
