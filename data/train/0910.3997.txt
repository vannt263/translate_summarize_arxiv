    "iron plays an outstanding role in studies of cool stars thanks to quite numerous lines in the visible spectrum , which are easy to detect even in very metal - poor stars .",
    "iron serves as a reference element for all astronomical research related to stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "iron lines are used to determine the surface gravity , @xmath1 , and the microturbulence @xmath2 of stellar atmospheres . in the atmosphere with @xmath3",
    "k , neutral iron is a minority species . the ionization equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii and the excitation equilibrium of fe  i easily deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "since the beginning of the 1970s a number of studies attacked the problem of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) for fe ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* athay & lites ( 1972 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thevenin & idiart ( 1999 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gehren  ( 2001 ) ) ) .",
    "however , a consensus on the expected magnitude of the nlte effects was not reached .    in this study , we update the model atom of fe i - ii treated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gehren  ( 2001 ) ) ( hereafter paper  i ) and apply it to analysis of the fe spectrum in the sun and selected cool stars with the aim of empirically constraining the role of inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms in the se of fe  i - ii .",

    "* nave  ( 1994 ) ) with later updates provided 965 energy levels for fe  i. a comparison with the calculated fe  i atomic structure ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "i is the overionization of low - excitation levels by ultraviolet radiation .",
    "the role of high - excitation levels is to compensate , in part , for population losses via collisional coupling to the large continuum reservoir , with subsequent spontaneous transitions down to low - excitation levels .",
    "therefore , the system of levels in the model atom of fe  i has to be fairly complete at least up to 0.5  ev ( mean kinetic energy of electrons in the atmosphere ) below the ionization limit .    for fe  i , our model atom was constructed using all known energy levels and the predicted levels with @xmath4 up to 7.83  ev , in total , 2970 levels .",
    "multiplet fine structure was neglected for all terms .",
    "the predicted and measured levels with close energies were combined resulting in 233 terms .",
    "in addition , six super - levels were made up from the remaining predicted levels .",
    "for 11958 radiative transitions occurring in this atom of fe  i , @xmath6-values were taken from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nave ( 1994 ) ) compilation , where available , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kurucz ( 2007 ) ) calculations .",
    "photoionization cross - sections of the iron project ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bautista ( 1997 ) ) ) have been used for 149 levels and a hydrogenic approximation for the remaining levels .",
    "the collisional rates were computed as in paper  i.    for fe  ii , we rely on the reference model atom treated in paper  i. in this study , it was reduced and includes now the levels with @xmath4 up to 10  ev . the main uncertainty of the nlte calculations for fe  i and ii is the treatment of the poorly known inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms .",

    "* steenbock & holweger ( 1984 ) ) for allowed transitions and a simple correlation between hydrogen and electron collisional rates , @xmath7 , for forbidden transitions .",
    "calculations were performed with the hydrogen collision enhancement factor @xmath8 , which was varied between 0 and 3 .",
    "the coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations are solved with an improved version of the detail program ( ( * ? ? ? * butler & giddings ( 1985 ) ) ) based on the accelerated lambda iteration .",
    "all calculations are performed with plane - parallel , homogeneous , lte , and blanketed model atmospheres computed with the mafags - os code ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* grupp ( 2009 ) ) ) .    for comparison with observed data ,",
    "a total of 43 lines of fe  i and 18 lines of fe  ii were chosen .",
    "for the sun and hd84937 , the analysis was extended to a larger line list including 271 lines of fe  i and 34 lines of fe  ii .",
    "the sun is also used as a reference star for a line - by - line differential analysis of stellar spectra .",

    "it is worth noting that , with the updated model atom of fe  i - ii , the departures from lte are substantially smaller compared to those from the previous studies .",

    "for the fe  i / fe  ii ionization equilibrium in two metal - poor stars , lte seems to be as good as nlte with @xmath23 .",

    "negligible nlte effects were obtained for fe  ii .",
    "fe  i is subject to significant nlte effects for low gravity ( @xmath28 ) and very metal - poor models .",
    "an important consequence is that surface gravities of giants and very metal - poor stars derived by lte analysis are in error with a magnitude strongly depending on @xmath1/[fe / h ] .",
    "for example , lte leads to a 0.26  dex lower gravity for @xmath25 5000  k , @xmath1 = 2 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath27 .",
    "* completeness of model atom for fe  i is important for a correct calculation of the fe  i / fe  ii ionization equilibrium in the atmosphere of cool stars .",
