    "the quantum version of this model , by probing the universe wave functions , is considered in section  @xmath1 , where the general properties of solutions in the commutative and nc frames are compared . in section",
    "@xmath2 , we employ the noether theorem and explore the effects of noncommutativity on the underlying symmetries in the commutative frame .",
    "conclusions are presented in the last section , and some necessary formulations have been furnished in the appendix .",
    "we consider a classical model consisting of a cosmological system presented by a four dimensional action with two non  minimally scalar fields coupled to gravity in a friedman  robertson  walker ( * frw * ) universe . to specify the nc effects of the model",
    ", we first treat the commutative version and then consider the nc one in the following subsections .      a general action for non  minimally coupled double scalar fields can be written as  @xcite @xmath3-v(\\phi,\\psi)\\right\\}d^4x\\hspace{1mm},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the determinant of the metric @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the ricci scalar , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are coupling and ( total ) potential functions of scalar fields , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two typical functions coupled to the kinetic terms .",
    "we assume homogeneous scalar fields , that is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in the following frw metric @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a lapse function , @xmath15 is a scale factor and @xmath16 specifies spatial geometry of the universe .",
    "we restrict our considerations to a non  interacting conformally scalar field model .",
    "ansatz _ is obviously restrictive .",
    "however , a general reason for selecting such scalar fields is for simplicity .",
    "indeed , it allows exact solutions in simple cases , as those will be discussed in this work and are rich enough to be useful as a probe for significant modifications that ncg introduces in the classical and quantum cosmologies .",
    "thus in this case , one can set @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a function of its argument as @xmath19 . also , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a non  minimal coupling parameter with an arbitrary value that represents a direct coupling between the curvature and the scalar fields .",
    "the case @xmath22 obviously is the minimally coupling situation ; however in this work , we consider the conformal coupling case , i.e. @xmath23 , and employ the units @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) .",
    "we also , in general , consider the scalar fields that are  not subject to any potential , , can also be achieved by non  interacting ( inner ) potentials , e.g. @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cosmological constant .",
    "such a case is an important one in models with double scalar fields  @xcite . ] and assume more simple cases with @xmath29 .",
    "however , at the end of this section , we will investigate the particular case of non  zero constant values of the potential function ( i.e. the cosmological constant ) .",
    "now , based on these assumptions , substituting metric ( [ b2 ] ) into action ( [ b1 ] ) yields the lagrangian density @xmath30 where a total time derivative term has been neglected . by rescaling the scalar fields as @xmath31 lagrangian ( [ b3 ] )",
    "reads @xmath32 then , the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the corresponding canonical conjugate momenta . for the conformal time gauge selection , namely @xmath37",
    ", one gets @xmath38 therefore , the hamilton equations are @xmath39    solutions of equations ( [ b6 ] ) , with the hamiltonian constraint @xmath40 , depend on the curvature index ; actually their solutions are @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 s , @xmath45 s and @xmath46 s are constants of integration .",
    "as it is obvious , if one of the scalar fields vanishes and/or be equal to each other , i.e. @xmath47 , all equations will lead to those derived in the case of one scalar field in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we will compare these solutions with their nc analogs in the next section .      in the classical physics , noncommutativity",
    "is achieved by replacing ordinary product with the so  called moyal product , shown by the @xmath48 notation .",
    "this associative product on @xmath49dimensional phase space is defined between two arbitrary functions of general phase space variables , namely @xmath50 for @xmath51 , as  @xcite @xmath52f(\\zeta_1)g(\\zeta_2 ) { \\biggr|}_{\\zeta_1=\\zeta_2=\\zeta}\\ , , \\ ] ] such that the symplectic structure is @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath55 are assumed to be real , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are antisymmetric , and @xmath58 ( which can be written as a combination of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) is symmetric .",
    "the modified ( or the @xmath59star deformed ) poisson brackets are defined , in terms of the moyal product , as @xmath60 hence , the modified poisson brackets of the phase space variables are @xmath61    for classical evolution , one starts by proposing that the nc nature of the minisuperspace variables can be encoded in a deformation of the poisson structure .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the hamiltonian does  not need any modification .",
    "hence , for our model , we require that the algebra of the minisuperspace variables obeys relations ( [ a4 ] ) in terms of the moyal product defined in ( [ a1 ] ) . however , to introduce such deformations , it is more convenient to consider a linear and non  canonical transformation on the classical phase space as ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath62 then , if the variables of classical phase space obey the usual poisson brackets , i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the primed variables will yield @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , to consider the noncommutativity effects , one can work with the ordinary poisson brackets ( [ a43 ] ) instead of the @xmath59star deformed poisson brackets ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , transformation ( [ a42 ] ) allows an extension of the commutative classical mechanics to the nc one . in the geometrical language , the usual poisson brackets are mapped onto the modified poisson brackets through transformation ( [ a42 ] ) and vice versa .",
    "it is evident that , for a compatible extension , transformation ( [ a42 ] ) must be invertible , and this imposes a condition on the nc parameters which we will specify for our model in below .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath67 be the hamiltonian of a system including the commutative variables ; we shift the canonical variables through ( [ a42 ] ) and assume that the functional form of the hamiltonian in the nc case is still the same as the commutative one , i.e. @xmath68 this function is also defined on the commutative space and , obviously , equations of motion for unprimed variables are @xmath69  and @xmath70 .",
    "evidently , the effects due to the noncommutativity arise by terms including the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "now , in our model , the following notations are adopted    @xmath71 @xmath72 .    and ,",
    "in this work , we assume that the only non  zero nc parameters are and @xmath73 while they commute with the scale factor is completely consistent with noncommutativity between the original scalar fields , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , while they also commute with the scale factor . ] @xmath76 hence @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants .",
    "actually , in accordance with ( [ a42 ] ) , we consider the following transformation @xmath80 transformation ( [ c3 ] ) dictates that it is inverted when its determinant is  not zero , that is when @xmath81 .",
    "then , by making transformation ( [ c3 ] ) in hamiltonian ( [ b5,2 ] ) , the nc hamiltonian is @xmath82 and equations of motion are @xmath83 and @xmath84 equations ( [ c9 ] ) show that , in general , the motion equations of the scalar fields are coupled in the nc case , and these equations reduce to the commutative equations ( [ b6 ] ) for @xmath85 , as expected .",
    "also , in the purposed model , the noncommutativity does  not affect the time dependence of the scale factor and its solution is the same as the commutative case .",
    "the motion equations of the scalar fields , after eliminating momenta variables in ( [ c9 ] ) , are @xmath86 with the hamiltonian constraint    @xmath87 @xmath88 is possible only when @xmath89 , and hence @xmath90 . ]    or    @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "space  time geometries with @xmath93 only satisfy the latter constraint for any @xmath78 , while @xmath89 geometry fulfills the former constraint with @xmath90 ( and consequently , because of the inversion condition , @xmath94 ) , and the latter one with @xmath95 . in general ,",
    "solutions of ( [ c13 ] ) depend on the sign of a quantity defined as @xmath96 .    for @xmath97 ,",
    "the sign of @xmath98 is always positive , and thus , the real solution of equations ( [ c13 ] ) can be written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are constants of integration subject to the corresponding hamiltonian constraint , and @xmath102 obviously , the corresponding terms in ( [ c16 ] ) are in @xmath103 phase difference .    in the case of @xmath104 ,",
    "the nc parameter @xmath78 does  not actually appear in equations ( [ c13 ] ) , and hence , in a spatially flat frw universe , the scalar fields motion equations are affected only by the nc parameter @xmath79 . besides , one gets @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and thus solutions are similar to the motion of a free harmonic oscillator . however , the time dependence of solutions are modified from linear in the commutative case , to periodic in the nc case with the period of @xmath107 which allows the model to be adjusted more easily with the observational data .    for @xmath108 geometry ,",
    "the commutative solutions ( [ c14 ] ) are simple harmonics with the period of @xmath109 , whereas , the nc solutions ( [ c16 ] ) in general are  not , though they still oscillate between two limits .",
    "incidentally , solutions ( [ c16 ] ) are symmetric with respect to the nc parameters , and results do  not vary by replacement of their roles .",
    "besides , as @xmath110 , each solution of ( [ c16 ] ) can be considered as a forced ( driven ) harmonic oscillator , such that if the ratio of @xmath111 is a rational fraction , then solutions will be periodic ( as in the lissajous figures ) with angular frequency given by the greatest common divisor of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "otherwise , solutions are non  periodic and never repeat themselves .",
    "a general condition that picks periodic solutions has been obtained in the appendix ( supplemented with a diagram ) . meanwhile , in the following special example , we provide a better insight about this situation .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let us consider the special case @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , for which solutions ( [ c16 ] ) read @xmath116 with initial conditions @xmath117 ,  @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the condition for the periodic solutions is    @xmath120 ,    where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are positive integers and obviously @xmath123 . by solving this equation in terms of @xmath78",
    ", one gets    @xmath124 .",
    "this relation provides different values of @xmath78 parameter in terms of two integers , for which solutions ( [ c17 ] ) can be periodic .",
    "it is constructive to plot @xmath78 in terms of @xmath125 as a continuous quantity , is a rational number greater than unity , indeed , @xmath126 yields @xmath127 which resumes the commutative case . ] and this has been illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath128 for range @xmath129 . as it is obvious",
    ", @xmath130 is always positive , thus the function @xmath131 changes monotonically with @xmath132 .",
    "also , when @xmath132 has very large values , the rate @xmath130 approximately decreases as @xmath133 .",
    "for the smallest allowed values of integers , i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we get the smallest value of @xmath78 parameter , i.e. @xmath136 for the periodic solutions . in solutions ( [ c17 ] ) ,",
    "the terms @xmath137 and @xmath138 are envelopes of the corresponding curves .",
    "these types of oscillations , due to the periodic variation of the amplitude , are usually called beats .",
    "the well  known example of such oscillations is the simple harmonic one , where a driven force causes mechanical beats .",
    "also , this situation can be simulated in the acoustical systems that produce a sound effect , known as beating  @xcite , when @xmath139 is sufficiently small and the terms including @xmath140 in ( [ c17 ] ) are ignored . as a sample illustration of the beating effect for these _ cosmical oscillators _",
    ", we have graphed a plot of @xmath141 , equations ( [ c17 ] ) , with its envelopes @xmath142 , in fig .",
    "@xmath0 ( right ) for numerical values @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "as the figure illustrates , beats are more obvious when the envelopes are drawn .    *",
    "fig . 1 * : the nc parameter @xmath78 , in @xmath108 case with @xmath145 , as a function of @xmath146 .",
    "the points whose @xmath132 are rational    fractions correspond to the periodic scalar fields , and other points correspond to non  periodic ones .        *",
    "2 * : the nc case for @xmath108 : periodic field ( left ) with @xmath147 , beating effect ( right ) with @xmath143 and @xmath114    including the cosmical oscillator ( solid line ) and envelops ( dashed lines ) .    when the ratio of @xmath113 and @xmath112 is  not a rational fraction , solutions are non  periodic but , as periodic cases , their behaviors still depend on the values of the nc parameters . for example",
    ", if one constructs a plot with numerous or a few relative extremum in a given time interval , then iterative drawings will indicate that the separation between the high and low points increases when the nc parameters tend to smaller values .",
    "this property is intensified for values less than unity , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath1 for @xmath148 in equations ( [ c16 ] ) with constants @xmath149 and @xmath150 . from this point of view , the nc solutions have particular preference with respect to the corresponding commutative ones .",
    "* : non  periodic field in the nc case for @xmath108 : with @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( solid line ) ,    and with @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( dashed line ) .    for @xmath89 geometries , one has @xmath155 that can be either positive , or negative or zero depending on different choices of the nc parameters .",
    "that is , when ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) or ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) , @xmath98 is positive and hence one gets solutions of type ( [ c16 ] ) .",
    "however , in this case , the nc parameters have upper and lower bounds , and there is more restriction on finding the periodic solutions than in @xmath108 geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath98 is negative and @xmath160 , the real solutions of equations ( [ c13 ] ) are @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are constants of integration subject to the corresponding hamiltonian constraint . solutions ( [ c15 ] ) are constrained to the condition that both nc parameters simultaneously have a lower bound , namely @xmath78 and @xmath164 , or an upper bound , @xmath78 and @xmath165 .",
    "also , in the case @xmath108 , oscillations of the scalar fields in ( [ c15 ] ) have the phase difference of @xmath103 .",
    "these solutions , in contrast to their commutative analogs , are oscillating with a time hyperbolic amplitude that depends on the nc parameters and gives enough room for better adjustments .",
    "for instance , one can change the time interval between two successive zero points of the scalar fields , for the interval is @xmath166 . besides , increasing and decreasing amplitudes in ( [ c15 ] ) with respect to the time depend on initial conditions . as an example , if one chooses the initial condition @xmath167 , then solutions of ( [ c15 ] ) will oscillate with decreasing amplitudes .",
    "such solutions are similar to the damped harmonic oscillators with amplitudes proportional to @xmath168 as envelopes .",
    "the main characters of such an oscillator , namely the _ time decay _ and the _ natural frequency _ , can be described in terms of the nc parameters as @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "another interesting point is that , if one assumes @xmath78 and @xmath171 then , solutions will damp quickly .",
    "inversely , to possess more lately damped oscillations , the best choice of the nc parameters in the range @xmath78 and @xmath165 is when one assumes @xmath172 and @xmath173 , in which each of the scalar fields has a maximum number of oscillations before the complete damping occurs .",
    "the diagram of such an oscillation is plotted in fig .",

    "when @xmath178 in @xmath89 geometry , solutions of ( [ c13 ] ) are decoupled hyperbolic time functions with the coefficient @xmath179 in the exponent , which is the only difference between the nc and commutative solutions .",
    "the case @xmath180 is also possible when @xmath90 or when @xmath181 , where solutions ( [ c15 ] ) are again periodic with the period of @xmath182 or @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "note that , the case @xmath89 with @xmath90 resembles the constraint condition @xmath88 with arbitrary @xmath79 , and however for @xmath181 one gets trivial constant solutions , but this value is  not allowed .",
    "* fig . 4 * : damping scalar field in the nc case @xmath89 : late damping with @xmath176 and @xmath184 ( solid line ) , and    quick damping with @xmath174 and @xmath185 ( dashed line ) .",
    "* non  zero constant potential *    let us obtain the equations of motion for the scale factor when one considers a non  zero constant value for the potential function ( i.e. a cosmological constant ) in action ( [ b1 ] ) . thus ,",

    "but , the hamiltonian equations of the scale factor , for both the commutative and nc cases , are modified in the same manner as @xmath189 eliminating the momentum variable gives @xmath190 by integrating , one gets @xmath191 where @xmath192 is an integration constant . solution of equation ( [ cd ] ) can be written in terms of the jacobi elliptic functions , that is @xmath193 where the initial condition @xmath194 , @xmath195^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] the jacobi function , on the right hand side ( [ cd1 ] ) , behaves as a sine function when @xmath59 is a real and @xmath196 is either a real or a pure imaginary number . therefore , for negative potentials in an arbitrary geometry , and also for positive potentials in the @xmath108 geometry when @xmath197 , the scale factor behaves periodically as a sinusoidal function . on the other hand , for positive potentials in @xmath198 geometries , and in the @xmath108 geometry when @xmath199 , the jacobi function has a complex value , and hence these situations are  not allowed .    in the limit @xmath200 for @xmath108",
    ", one gets @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 behaves as @xmath204 .",
    "hence , we get back to the free  potential solution ( [ c14 ] ) , as expected . however , in such a limit , for @xmath205 , as @xmath206 , solution ( [ cd1 ] ) is  not valid , and hence , one must consider equation ( [ cd ] ) .",
    "now , by regarding the limit @xmath200 in equation ( [ cd ] ) for @xmath205 , and solving the resulted equation , one again gets the free  potential solutions ( [ c141 ] ) and ( [ c142 ] ) , respectively .",
    "although the effects of nc cosmology are mostly desired and important in classical approaches , but still it is instructive to investigate its quantum counterparts . in particular ,",
    "if a universe has been commenced by a big bang or from a very very tiny scale , then it would be plausible that quantum behaviors should have significant implications in its evolution and cosmology .",
    "thus , in this section we proceed to quantize the cosmological model given by action ( [ b1 ] ) for free  potential , such that the canonical quantization of the phase space leads to the wd equation , @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the hamiltonian operator and @xmath209 is a wave function of the universe  @xcite .",
    "we employ the usual canonical transition from classical to quantum mechanics via the generalized dirac quantization of the poisson brackets to quantum commutators , i.e. @xmath210 $ ] .",
    "then , as the classical approach , we investigate the general properties of the wave function in the commutative and nc frames of the quantum model in the following subsections .",
    "it is well  known  @xcite that , in the nc quantum mechanics , the original phase space and its symplectic structure are modified .",
    "that is , for the nc proposal of quantum cosmology , we assume that operators ( variables ) of the frw minisuperspace obey a kind of deformed heisenberg algebra like the ones in the nc quantum mechanics as  @xcite @xmath237=i\\theta_{ij}\\ , , \\hspace{.5cm}[\\hat{x}_i,\\hat{p}_j]=i(\\delta_{ij}+\\sigma_{ij } ) \\hspace{.5cm}{\\rm and}\\hspace{.5cm}[\\hat{p}_i,\\hat{p}_j]=i\\beta_{ij}\\ , .\\ ] ] the notations and definitions are the same as in the nc classical model .",
    "this kind of extended noncommutativity maintains symmetry between the canonical operators , and yields the usual heisenberg algebra in the limit @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath238 . as usual , this deformation can be redefined in terms of noncommutativity of minisuperspace functions with the moyal product defined in ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the corresponding noncommutative wd equation can be written by replacing the operator product , in equation ( [ d1 ] ) , with the star product , namely @xmath239 .    however , it is possible to reformulate equations in terms of the commutative operators with the ordinary product of functions if the new operators are introduced , again as our previous assumption @xmath240 clearly , if unprimed operators obey the usual heisenberg commutators , then the non  zero primed operators will obey the deformed heisenberg commutators ( [ a8 ] ) in the form    @xmath241=i\\theta,\\hspace{.5cm}[\\hat{x}',\\hat{p}'_x]=i(1+\\theta\\beta)=[\\hat{y}',\\hat{p}'_y]\\quad { \\rm and } \\quad [ \\hat{p}'_x,\\hat{p}'_y]=4i\\beta .$ ]    therefore , operator transformation ( [ a911 ] ) can be regarded as a generalization of the usual quantum mechanics to the nc one . on the other hand , the inverse transformation of ( [ a911 ] ) are    @xmath242    where @xmath243 .",
    "consequently , one can go from the usual commutators to the deformed ones and vice versa provided that again @xmath244 . as a result , the original equation , employing the new operators , reads  @xcite @xmath245 hence , the noncommutative wd equation corresponding to the nc hamiltonian ( [ c4 ] ) is @xmath246\\psi_{\\rm nc}(a , x , y)=0\\,,\\ ] ] which in the polar coordinates ( [ d2 ] ) yields @xmath247\\psi_{\\rm nc}(a,\\rho,\\varphi)=0.\\ ] ]    when @xmath248 , by using the _ ansatz _ ( [ d4 ] ) , equation ( [ d10 ] ) is separable to @xmath249 and @xmath250b=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath221 is a constant of separation .",
    "the scale factor part of the wave function , equation ( [ d11 ] ) , is similar to its commutative analog ( [ d41 ] ) , as expected .",

    "this case also restricts commutative solution ( [ ac ] ) with initial conditions @xmath320 .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath304 case , the noncommutativity reduces the number of symmetries to one for @xmath284 and two for @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath321 , the last row of constraints in ( [ p1 ] ) is omitted . in this case , one choice is @xmath89 and @xmath178 , where a non  trivial ( i.e. @xmath322 ) linear solution exists if and only if @xmath323 .",
    "hence , by the sign change of functions , i.e. @xmath324 and @xmath325 ( or equivalently @xmath326 ) , the solution is the same as the commutative solution ( [ l ] ) , which again yields the constants of motion and symmetric vectors ( [ m ] ) and ( [ ae ] ) .",
    "however for @xmath89 and a special value of @xmath327 , it gives one solution ( i.e. ( [ r ] ) ) , but this case is  not allowed due to the inversion condition @xmath81 . for another choice @xmath305 with any value of @xmath78 , it gives the commutative solution ( [ ac ] ) .",
    "that is , even though the noncommutativity is still present , the number of symmetries and constants of motion do  not change with respect to the corresponding commutative case .",
    "note that , in all cases , irrespective of whether the noncommutativity exists or not , and for any value of the curvature index , the angular momentum about the @xmath270axis is conserved , as expected . besides , in the above considerations , we have  not , in general , specified numerical values of the nc parameters .",
    "we have carried out an investigation for the role of ncg in cosmological scenarios , based on a four  dimensional free  potential ( multi)scalar  tensor action of gravity , by introducing a nc deformation in the minisuperspace variables .",
    "the phase space is generated by two non  interacting conformal scalar fields plus the scale factor with their canonical conjugate momenta .",
    "the scalar fields are non  minimally coupled to geometry whose background is the frw metric , where the conformal time gauge evolutions have been studied . the noncommutativity has been introduced only between the scalar fields and between their canonical conjugate momenta via two nc parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the investigation has been carried out for this toy model by means of a comparative mathematical analysis of the time evolution of the dynamical variables in the classical level and of the wave function of the universe in the quantum perspective , both in the commutative and nc frames .",
    "we have paid more attention to the outcome of results and have looked for the relations , including ranges and values , among the nc parameters for which particular or allowed solutions exist .",
    "in general , we have shown by this toy model that the purposed noncommutativity has important implications in the evolution of the universe , however , does  not affect the time dependence of the scale factor , i.e. its solution is the same as the commutative case , as expected .",
    "also , we have found that one of the particularity of the nc parameter in the momenta sector , i.e. @xmath79 , is in the spatially flat frw universe , where it is the only responsible parameter for the nc effects in the classical and quantum frames .    in the classical model",
    ", exact solutions have been obtained .",
    "one of the important aspects of the nc solutions is that they can be regulated with both nc parameters .",
    "for example , these parameters can be employed to adjust the time dependence of solutions with the experimental or observational data .",
    "a distinguished feature of the noncommutativity effects , which we call a cosmical oscillator , is that the scalar fields behave similar to ( or can be simulated with ) the three most important harmonic oscillators depending on three values of the spatial curvature .",
    "these are the free , forced and damped harmonic oscillators corresponding to the flat , closed and open universes , respectively . in the flat universes , the time dependence of solutions",
    "are modified from linear in the commutative case to periodic in the nc frame . in the closed universes ,",
    "if the ration of frequencies of the scalar fields is a rational fraction , then solutions will be periodic .",
    "this condition restricts the nc parameters . when this ratio is  not a rational fraction , the solutions are non  periodic but their behaviors still depend on the values of the nc parameters .",
    "a plot with numerous ( or a few ) relative extremum in a given time interval indicates that the separation between the high and low points increases when the nc parameters tend to smaller values , and this property is intensified for values less than unity . from this point of view , the nc solutions have particular preference with respect to the corresponding commutative ones .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath108 case , the solutions are symmetric with respect to the nc parameters , and the results do  not vary by replacement of their roles . also , when the nc parameters are small , the cosmical oscillators have analogous effects with the familiar beating effects in the sound phenomena . for a better view on this situation ,",
    "an example has been illustrated in the text . in the open universes ,",
    "there are upper and lower bounds on the nc parameters .",
    "the quick and late damping of this case can be adjusted by the nc parameters .",
    "for example , for @xmath328  and @xmath329 , the scalar fields have maximum number of oscillations before the complete damping occurs .",
    "we have also shown that the existence of a non  zero constant value of the potential function ( i.e. the cosmological constant ) does  not change the time evolutions of the scalar fields , but it modifies the time dependence of the scale factor in a same manner for both the commutative and nc frames .",
    "indeed , we have obtained that in all allowed conditions the scale factor behaves as a sinusoidal function .    in the quantum model ,",
    "the exact solutions for the wave functions of the universe have also been obtained .",
    "the scale factor part of the wave function is similar to its commutative analog , as expected .",
    "one still expects that when the noncommutativity effects are turned on in the quantum scenario , they should introduce significant modifications in the scalar fields . however , an interesting feature of the well  behaved solutions is that the functional form of the radial part of the nc wave function is the same as the commutative ones within the given replacements of constants caused by the nc parameters , although these replacements in turn may cause drastic effects .",
    "for example , the curvature index is modified , and in open universes , the allowed nc wave functions impose bounds on the nc parameters .    finally , we have employed the noether theorem and have explored the effects of noncommutativity on the underlying symmetries in the commutative frame .",
    "we have shown that for spatially flat universes , there are six noether symmetries , and , in general , only two of them are retained in the nc case . in the special case @xmath305 ,",
    "all symmetries survive regardless of the existence of @xmath78 parameter . for non ",
    "flat universes , there are three noether symmetries in the commutative case , one of which is retained in the nc frame . however ,",
    "in open universes , when the nc parameters have the values @xmath323 , the number and general form of symmetries do  not change with respect to the commutative frame . the only difference is related to the sign of symmetries .",
    "conservation of the angular momentum about the scale factor axis is a common face between the commutative and nc cases , as expected in the purposed noncommutativity .",
    "we should emphasis that the scalar fields solutions are given after rescalings of the original fields , relations ( [ rescalingfields ] ) , and in the conformal time .",
    "consequently , the functional forms of the solutions are  not as simple when translated to the original fields .",
    "however , any detection should be performed in a reference frame , and there are debates on the physical frame in the cosmological contexts . besides , the model is to be taken as a toy model only that still provides a valuable contribution to the assessment of the implications of the nc geometrical deformations of the phase space upon the dynamics of the cosmological model envisaged .",
    "however , a more realistic nc cosmological model may be achieved when one also involves the noncommutativity of the scalar fields with the scale factor , where the value of its time derivative in the form of the hubble parameter can be determined from observations .",
    "we first obtain a general relation among the nc parameters when the solutions ( [ c16 ] ) are periodic .",
    "then , we treat a specific periodic solution as an example .",
    "as mentioned in the text when @xmath108 , solutions ( [ c16 ] ) play as the forced oscillators , and the existence of periodic solutions is provided when the ratio @xmath111 is a rational fraction . in this case , the @xmath98 parameter , by its definition , is @xmath330 ; hence by the transformation reversibility constraint @xmath81 , one always has @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , by definitions ( [ c161 ] ) , we can take @xmath332 and @xmath333 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are two positive integers with @xmath123 , and @xmath234 is an arbitrary non ",
    "zero positive constant .",
    "hence , again , definitions ( [ c161 ] ) give @xmath334 these relations impose a firm restriction on the values of the nc parameters ( or equivalently on allowed positive integers ) .",
    "indeed , the condition for periodic scalar fields is that , the values of the nc parameters must be such that there exist two positive integers satisfying relations ( [ ca ] ) .",
    "as @xmath78 and @xmath79 are real roots of the quadratic equation @xmath335 , relations ( [ ca ] ) lead to @xmath336 the above result implies that if one finds a pair of integers satisfying inequality ( [ caa ] ) , then the values of the nc parameters will be calculated from equations ( [ ca ] ) .",
    "let us treat a specific example for the above considerations .",
    "consider the equality in relation ( [ caa ] ) , which yields @xmath178 , which also by the constraint @xmath81 gives @xmath95 ( note that we have assumed @xmath337 ) .",
    "also , by definitions ( [ c161 ] ) , we have @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "thus , by imposing the periodic condition as @xmath340 it leads to @xmath341 where @xmath196 is a real number greater than one . gives the commutative case .",
    "] in the limit @xmath342 , one solution of ( [ caaaa ] ) yields @xmath343 , as expected ; however , the other one gives infinity that is  not physically accepted .",
    "also , in the limit @xmath344 , we have @xmath345 , which , in general , may be viewed as a transition from the forced harmonic oscillator in the @xmath108 geometry to the simple one in the @xmath104 case . in another words ,",
    "when the value of @xmath196 slowly gets bigger and bigger , then the driven force is gradually removed away from the cosmical oscillators .",
    "the time evolution of scalar field @xmath141 , equation ( [ c16 ] ) , is depicted in fig .",
    "@xmath0 ( left ) for the numerical value @xmath346 corresponding to @xmath151 , with superposition constants @xmath149 and @xmath150 . the period of solutions is the least common multiple of distinct periods , namely @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects caused by noncommutativity of the phase space generated by two scalar fields that have non  minimal conformal couplings to the background curvature in the frw cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict deformation of the minisuperspace to noncommutativity between the scalar fields and between their canonical conjugate momenta . </S>",
    "<S> then , the investigation is carried out by means of a comparative analysis of the mathematical properties ( supplemented with some diagrams ) of the time evolution of variables in a classical model and the wave function of the universe in a quantum perspective , both in the commutative and noncommutative frames . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the impose of noncommutativity causes more ability in tuning time solutions of the scalar fields and hence , has important implications in the evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we get that the noncommutative parameter in the momenta sector is the only responsible parameter for the noncommutative effects in the spatially flat universes . </S>",
    "<S> a distinguishing feature of the noncommutative solutions of the scalar fields is that they can be simulated with the well  known three harmonic oscillators depending on three values of the spatial curvature . namely the free , forced and damped harmonic oscillators corresponding to the flat , closed and open universes , respectively . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> we call them _ cosmical oscillators_. in particular , in closed universes , when the noncommutative parameters are small , the cosmical oscillators have analogous effect with the familiar beating effect in the sound phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> some of the special solutions in the classical model and the allowed wave functions in the quantum model make bounds on the values of the noncommutative parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a non  zero constant potential ( i.e. a cosmological constant ) does  not change time evolutions of the scalar fields , but modifies the scale factor </S>",
    "<S> . an interesting feature of well  behaved solutions of the wave functions is that the functional form of the radial part is the same as the commutative ones within a given replacement of constants caused by the noncommutative parameters . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the noether theorem has been employed to explore the effects of noncommutativity on the underlying symmetries in the commutative frame . </S>",
    "<S> two of the six noether symmetries of spatially flat universes , in general , are retained in the noncommutative case , and one out of the three ones in non  </S>",
