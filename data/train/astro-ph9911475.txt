    "understanding the origin of the luminous , ionising continuum from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is one of the prime goals of agn research . despite the general acceptance of the standard agn paradigm",
    " that the continuum ( uv ) emission originates in an accretion disk around a super - massive black hole  the details remain unclear . in the x - ray band , there is a hard power - law component that dominates above 2  kev in the well studied seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "this hard x - ray continuum may originate from a hot corona above the surface of the accretion disk , in which optical / uv photons from the disk are comptonised to x - ray energies .",
    "these x - rays then illuminate the disk , being either ` reflected ' towards the observer or thermalised back into optical / uv emission . in the x - ray spectral band , evidence for this disk reflection component",
    "is seen in the form of a fluorescent fe k@xmath6 line at 6.4  kev , an iron k edge at @xmath7  kev and a compton ` hard tail ' .",
    "all these features have been observed in seyfert  1 galaxies ( e.g. pounds et al .",
    "1990 , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the subject of this paper is the recently discovered _ radio - quiet _",
    "quasar pds  456 ( torres et al .",
    "1997 , simpson et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is _ the _ most luminous known object in the local universe ( z  @xmath0 ) ; indeed the bolometric luminosity of pds  456 exceeds that of the well - known radio - loud quasar 3c 273 .",
    "however , unlike 3c  273 , pds  456 is radio - quiet , and thus presumably not jet dominated .",
    "therefore , pds  456 provides a unique opportunity to study in detail the hard and soft x - ray components in a high luminosity , radio - quiet agn , and in particular to test models of reflection expected from the putative accretion disk .    in the next section",
    "we describe the multi - wavelength properties of pds  456 .",
    "the main subject of this paper is then covered ; the x - ray emission from pds  456 , using observations with _ asca _  and _ rxte_. values of @xmath8  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 and @xmath9 have been assumed throughout and all fit parameters are given in the quasar rest - frame .",
    "note that errors are in this paper are quoted at the 90% confidence level ( e.g. @xmath10 for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "at @xmath11 , pds  456 has a de - reddened , absolute blue magnitude m@xmath12 , making it more luminous than the radio - loud quasar 3c  273 ( @xmath13 , m@xmath14 ) .",
    "the galactic absorption column towards pds  456 is @xmath15  @xmath16 ( stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , with an extinction of a@xmath17 in the optical .",
    "we have performed a recent vla observation ; the total detected 6  cm flux of 8  mjy confirms that pds  456 is radio - quiet ( r@xmath18 = log[f@xmath19/f@xmath20  @xmath21  -0.74 ) .",
    "pds  456 has broad balmer and paschen lines , strong fe ii , a hard ( de - reddened ) optical continuum ( @xmath22 ) , and one of the strongest ` big blue bumps ' of any agn ( simpson et al .",
    "pds  456 is coincident ( to @xmath23 10 ) with the _ rosat _  soft x - ray source rxs  j172819.3 - 141600 ( voges _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) ; the count rate is @xmath24 ct / s corresponding to l@xmath25 ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution of pds  456 ( figure 1 ) , obtained from all our current data on this quasar ( including recent vla and iso data , listed in table 1 ) , gives a bolometric luminosity of @xmath1ergs@xmath2 , a value more typical of qsos at @xmath26 .",
    "pds  456 was observed by _ asca _  on 78 march 1998 with a total duration of @xmath4140  ks .",
    "standard screening criteria were applied to the _ asca _  data ( e.g. see the _ asca data reduction guide _ ) , giving a total ` good ' exposure time of @xmath27  ksec per detector .",
    "counts were extracted using a 4  circular aperture centered on the source , and the background was estimated using source - free regions at similar off - axis angles .",
    ".iso ( isophot ) and vla fluxes . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     we next tried a fit to highly ionised iron ( model 4 ) , the ( narrow ) line energy was fixed at 6.7 kev ( corresponding to he - like fe ) and the edge energy was left as a free parameter . in this case",
    "an acceptable fit was found to the data ( @xmath28 ) ; with a deep and highly ionised iron k edge at 8.7 kev with @xmath29 .",
    "narrow _ iron emission line was no longer required in the fit ( ew@xmath30 ev ) .",
    "the energy of the edge is consistent with iron of ionisation from fe  xxiii ",
    "figure 3 clearly illustrates the high ionisation state of the reprocessing material .",
    "note that we also tried fitting a smeared edge model ( width 1 kev ) , as might be expected from the inner disk , although the fit obtained was very similar to above . including a _ broad _ iron line in the model ( in addition to the edge , model 5 ) lead to a further improvement in the spectral fit ( @xmath31 ) , at a significance level of @xmath32 confidence ( f - test , 2 additional parameters ) .",
    "the line equivalent width is @xmath33  ev ; the line is broad ( @xmath34  kev ) and possibly redshifted ( e @xmath35  kev ) .",
    "we note that the detection of the ionised iron edge is robust , even after the inclusion of a broad line in the model fit .",
    "having established the presence of reprocessing by highly ionised matter , we then attempted to model these reprocessing features in terms of reflection of x - rays off the surface layers of an ionised accretion disk .",
    "the pexriv model in xspec was used ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , assuming a disk surface temperature of 10@xmath36 k ( e.g. zycki et al .  1994 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ) and a disk inclination angle of 30 .",
    "the disk ionisation parameter ( @xmath37 ) and the strength of the reflection component r ( = @xmath38 ) were both left as free parameters in the fit .",
    "( note that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number density of the material at a distance @xmath41 from an ionising source of luminosity @xmath42 , where @xmath42 is defined from 5 ev to 20 kev . )",
    "an ionised reflector provided a good fit to the hard x - ray spectrum and the iron k edge ( model 6 , @xmath28 ) , giving a value of r close to 1 and a high ionisation ( @xmath43  erg  cm  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "although a narrow iron k line is not required in this fit , the presence of a broad line was not ruled out ( ew @xmath44  ev ) .",
    "we also attempt to model the hard x - ray spectrum of pds  456 with a power - law modified by a warm line - of - sight absorber ( model 7 ) , using the absori routine in xspec ( note we assume a temperature of @xmath45  k ) .",
    "this model provides a good alternative description of the x - ray data , modelling both the ionised edge and providing a good overall fit @xmath46 ) .",
    "however both a large column of material ( @xmath47 @xmath16 ) and a very high degree of ionisation ( @xmath48  erg  cm  s@xmath2 ) are required to reproduce the energy and depth of the edge feature .",
    "extrapolation of the preferred hard x - ray spectral model to lower energies ( 0.7  kev ) does not provide an adequate description of the broad - band data .",
    "there remains a significant deficit of counts present below @xmath42  kev ( see figure 4 , panel 1 ) , indicating that significant intrinsic absorption ( in excess of galactic ) is present .",
    "a neutral absorber ( @xmath49 ) gave a poor fit ; the spectrum is poorly modelled and an excess of counts is present below 1 kev in the _ asca _  data .",
    "however an _ ionised _ absorber provides a good fit ( figure 4 , panel 2 ) , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( again assuming t  @xmath52  k ) .",
    "note that this material is not sufficiently ionised to reproduce the deep , ionised , iron k edge seen in the hard x - ray spectrum ; the absorber effectively contributes a negligible amount ( @xmath53 ) to the iron k edge .",
    "the absence of any appreciable optical absorption ( aside from galactic ) may also imply either a low intrinsic dust - to - gas ratio , or that most of the dust close to the central engine has sublimated .",
    "light curves were constructed by binning the data into 96 min orbital bins , for the background - subtracted _ rxte _  ( 210  kev ) and _ asca_(210 and 0.52  kev ) data .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  5 .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "light curve shows an increase by a factor of @xmath42.1 in 3 orbits ( 17  ksec ) .",
    "note that the time - averaged _ rxte _  flux in the 2 - 10 kev band is @xmath54 erg @xmath16 s@xmath55 , and if this flare is real , it would be the most rapid variation ever seen in a radio - quiet quasar .",
    "unfortunately the ( lower signal / noise ) _ asca _  observation had ended before the flare began , so independent confirmation is not possible . in order to assess the reality of this event , we consider two possibilities that arise because _ rxte _  is a non - imaging instrument : 1 ) the flare could be due to an error in the background subtraction , and 2 ) it could be due to variations in a contaminating source in the _ rxte _  beam .",
    "figure  6 shows the derived on source data ( 210  kev l1 ) along with two estimators of the background residuals ( 210  kev layer 2 [ l2 ] , and 2040  kev layer 1 [ l1 ] ) .",
    "the background model was determined in the same fashion for all three light curves .",
    "as x - rays from this rather weak source should not contribute significantly to the 210  kev l2 and 2040  kev l1 count rates , these residuals can be used to assess the quality of the background subtraction .",
    "the 210  kev l2 data are well - behaved , consistent with the estimated 0.15  ct / s systematic error , but the 2040  kev l1 show apparently small periodic daily excursions on the @xmath40.5  ct / s level . these latter excursions are not correlated with the flare , but instead look like errors in modelling the daily effect of saa passage .",
    "thus , we consider it unlikely that the observed flare could be due entirely to poor background subtraction .",
    "no contaminating sources of sufficient brightness were seen in the _ asca _  image , but that covered only @xmath420% of the @xmath56 _ rxte _  field - of - view . the rassbsc ( voges et al .",
    "1996 ) was searched and no sources were found within @xmath57 of pds  456 .",
    "_ ginga _  background fluctuation data ( butcher et al .",
    "1997 ) , which do cover a similar energy band , suggest a @xmath582% probability of a contaminating source at the 2  ct / s level ; a similar probability of 2.5% is found from the distribution of piccinotti et al .",
    "( 1982 ) . however , there is no assurance that the _ rxte _  field - of - view does not contain a highly variable contaminating source at a lower flux level .",
    "for instance , the butcher et al .",
    "data suggest that a few sources could be expected with mean _ rxte _  count rates of 0.20.4  ct / s .",
    "if one of these is a narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy ( nls1s can show factor of @xmath595 in a few hours ; e.g. , boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) , or even a bl - lac object , this could produce a spurious flare identical to the one seen .",
    "this is unlikely but can not be ruled out .",
    "thus the most likely interpretation of the data is that the flare is intrinsic to pds  456 , but other possibilities can not be completely excluded .",
    "the discussion below assumes that the flare is intrinsic to the qso .",
    "we find that pds  456 has an unusual x - ray spectrum , with a deep , highly ionised iron k edge and a broad ( but poorly constrained ) iron line , superimposed on a steep hard x - ray continuum .",
    "lower energy residuals , corresponding to a warm absorber also seem to be present in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the high energy iron k features arise from a highly ionised reprocessor .",
    "one possibility is through compton reflection of hard x - rays off a high ionisation accretion disk .",
    "an alternative model involves reprocessing from line - of - sight matter ( a ` warm absorber ' ) .",
    "however , in the latter case , the degree of ionisation required to produce such a deep and highly ionised edge seems rather high when compared to the warm absorbers observed in seyfert 1s ( reynolds 1997 ) ; indeed it is possible that such a high ionisation absorber may not be thermally stable ( see reynolds & fabian 1995 ) .",
    "overall an ionised reflector appears a more physically appealing description of the hard x - ray data .",
    "indeed strong , highly ionised , iron - k edge features are predicted by disk photoionisation models ( e.g. ross , fabian & young 1999 ) and are also thought to be observed in some high - state galactic black - hole candidates ( e.g. zycki , done & smith 1997 ) .",
    "the iron line and edge produced in such highly ionised disks can be significantly broadened through multiple compton scatterings ( e.g. ross et al .",
    "however we were unable to differentiate here between a smeared and a sharp iron edge , given the limited signal to noise of our observations .",
    "the high ionisation of the reflector could imply a high accretion rate in pds  456 ( relative to the eddington limit ) , particularly as @xmath60 in a photoionised accretion disk ( e.g. matt , fabian & ross 1993 ) .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the other x - ray properties of pds  456 , namely a steep underlying continuum and rapid x - ray variability , both of which are commonplace in nls1s ( vaughan et al .",
    "1999a and references therein ) .",
    "nls1s are also thought to be accreting near the eddington limit ( e.g. pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) ; indeed recent evidence has been found in one nls1 ( ark 564 ) for a spectrum consistent with ionised disk reflection ( vaughan et al .",
    "ionised iron line features have also been observed in other luminous radio - quiet quasars ( reeves et al .",
    "1997 ; nandra et al .",
    "an unusually high accretion rate may even account for the complete lack of x - ray spectral features in some of the most luminous quasars ( nandra et al .",
    "1995 , reeves & turner 1999 ) . however pds  456 seems to provide the clearest example for the presence of ionised iron features in a high luminosity agn .",
    "the one obvious flare in the x - ray light curve ( figure 5 ) has a doubling time of @xmath415  ks .",
    "this suggests , from simple light - crossing arguments , a maximum size of @xmath61  m for the varying region .",
    "for a black hole of mass @xmath62m@xmath63 ( corresponding to pds  456 , with l@xmath64 ergs@xmath2 , at the eddington limit ) , this implies that the x - ray flare occurs within a region of less than 2 schwarzschild radii ( 2r@xmath65 ) .",
    "( a more conservative h@xmath66 of 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 gives a region of @xmath67 , which is still tightly constrained ) .",
    "a smaller mass black hole would loosen this requirement somewhat , but would then imply a super - eddington accretion rate .",
    "_ therefore one possible implication of the rapid variability is accretion near to or greater than l@xmath68 .",
    "_ the variability also implies a ( non - beamed ) efficiency of converting matter to energy of @xmath4  5% , close to the limit for a schwarzschild black hole ( see fabian 1979 ) .",
    "some seyfert 1s ( such as mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ) can also exhibit rapid variability , limiting the x - ray emission to a few r@xmath65 .",
    "rapid flux changes have also been reported in 2 narrow - line qsos ; in pks 0558 - 504 , a 70% increase is observed in 3 minutes ( remillard et al .",
    "1991 ) and phl 1092 shows a reported increase by a factor of 3.8 , using the _ rosat _  hri , in less than 5000  sec ( brandt et al .",
    "1999 ) . in any event",
    ", the flare in pds  456 must come from a very compact region ( for instance , a small hot spot on the disk ) , presumably very close to the  central engine \" in which the luminosity is actually generated .    in conclusion pds  456 is a remarkable object , showing clear features of a high ionisation reprocessor , one possible interpretation of which is through reflection off a highly ionised accretion disk .",
    "both the high ionisation spectral features and the extreme rapid variability suggest that the super - massive black hole in pds  456 could be running at an unusually high accretion rate .",
