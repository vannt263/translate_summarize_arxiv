    "the pair - density - wave ( pdw ) state is a superconducting ( sc ) state of matter in which the cooper pairs have a finite momentum . due to the finite momentum carried by the pair , the sc order parameter",
    "is modulated periodically in space .",
    "the pdw state has recently received attention because it can explain the layer decoupling observed in the cuprate ( lbco ) , the original high @xmath0 superconductor , at the @xmath1 anomaly.@xcite at this doping the @xmath0 of the three - dimensional material is suppressed to temperatures as low as @xmath2k , where the meissner effect first appears and the system is in a three - dimensional @xmath3-wave sc phase . in contrast , away from @xmath1 , the sc @xmath0 in lbco is about 35k . in spite of the low @xmath0 of the uniform @xmath3-wave sc state at @xmath1 , in this doping regime the cuo planes are already superconducting for a range of temperatures well above @xmath0.@xcite with this in mind , berg and collaborators@xcite showed that this phenomenon can be explained if the cuo planes are in an inhomogeneous ( ` striped ' ) sc state , the pdw state , in which charge , spin and sc orders are intertwined with each other . in this state",
    "the sc order parameter oscillates along one direction in the cuo planes , and the average of the sc order parameter is zero in the cuo planes .",
    "the pdw state is similar to the traditional larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state@xcite where the cooper pairs have a non - zero center of mass momentum , which in the lo proposal is due to the presence of an external zeeman field , which breaks the time - reversal symmetry explicitly ( for a recent review of the lo state see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "however , the occurrence of the pdw sc state does not necessarily require to have a system in which time - reversal symmetry is explicitly broken , nor it does require time - reversal symmetry be spontaneously broken either .",
    "since it was proposed as a candidate competing state to the uniform @xmath3-wave sc order,@xcite the pdw state has been studied extensively .",
    "a landau - ginzburg ( lg ) theory of the pdw state provides a simple explanation of much of the observed phenomenology of , @xcite and of in magnetic fields .",
    "an outgrowth of these phenomenological theories is a statistical mechanical description of the thermal melting of the pdw phase by proliferation of topological defects which yielded a rich phase diagram which includes , in addition to the pdw phase , a novel charge @xmath4 sc state and a cdw phase.@xcite more recently , agterberg and garaud@xcite showed that it is possible to have a phase in which a uniform sc and pdw order parameters coexist in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the microscopic underpinnings of the pdw state are presently not as well understood as the phenomenologies . nevertheless , it has been shown that this state can appear in different regimes of several models . in the weak coupling limit ,",
    "such a state appears naturally in two dimensions ( 2d ) inside an electronic spin - triplet nematic phase.@xcite also at the mean field level , lee @xcite found that it is possible to have a pdw state in his model of ` amperian ' pairing@xcite and that the pdw state can explain the pseudo - gap features found in the angle - resolved photoemission experiment.@xcite in a series of papers , loder and collaborators@xcite found that a pdw superconducting state is preferred in a tight - binding model with strong attractive interactions ( although the critical value of the coupling constant above which the pdw is stable is presumably outside the range of validity of the weak coupling theory ) .",
    "similarly , pdw states with broken time - reversal invariance and parity have been found recently@xcite in a ` hot spot ' model , which also requires a critical ( and typically not small ) value of a coupling constant . on the other hand , in one - dimensional systems ( 1d )",
    "the pdw state has been shown to describe the sc state of the kondo - heisenberg chain,@xcite and a phase of an extended hubbard - heisenberg model on a two - leg ladder.@xcite we showed recently that the pdw state appearing in these two 1d models is actually a topological sc which supports majorana zero modes localized at its boundaries.@xcite    there has also been considerable recent effort to determine if the pdw state occurs in simple models of strongly correlated systems .",
    "variational monte carlo simulations of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 model on the square lattice at zero magnetic field near doping @xmath1 found that the uniform @xmath3-wave sc state is slightly favored over the pdw state.@xcite corboz and coworkers,@xcite using infinite projected entangled pair - states@xcite ( ipeps ) , found strong evidence in the 2d @xmath5 model that the ground state energies of the uniform @xmath3-wave state and the pdw state are numerically indistinguishable ( within the error bars ) over a broad range of dopings and parameters .",
    "this last result indicates that these strongly correlated systems do have a strong tendency to exhibit intertwined orders and that the pdw state occurs more broadly than was anticipated.@xcite    in this work , instead of following a conventional weak coupling approach to the pdw states , we will take an alternative path which has the physics of strong correlations as its starting point . rather than starting from a true 2d system",
    ", we will consider a quasi - one dimensional model consisting of weakly coupled ( each strongly - interacting ) 1d systems . in the decoupled limit",
    "we can solve each 1d system non - perturbatively using bosonization methods.@xcite we will follow a dimensional crossover approach that has been used with considerable success by several authors . @xcite we will consider a generalization of the model used by granath and coworkers@xcite in which there are two types of 1d subsystems : a set of doped two - leg ladders in the luther - emery ( le ) liquid regime ( which has a single gapless charge sector and a gapped spin sector ) and a set of 1d electronic luttinger liquids ( ell ) with both a gapless charge sector and a gapless spin sector .",
    "although the interactions between le liquids and between le and ell liquids will be treated by the interchain mean field theory ( mft ) ( see , e.g. carlson _ et al._@xcite ) , the intra le and intra ell interactions are treated essentially exactly using bosonization .",
    "we will make the reasonable assumption that the interaction between the electronic luttinger liquids leads to a crossover to a full 2d ( anisotropic ) fermi liquid ( see , e.g. ref . [ ] ) . in this fashion",
    ", this approach allows to access the strong coupling regime of a strongly correlated system using controlled approximations . in this approximation",
    "the resulting superconducting @xmath0 is a power law in the interchain coupling and not exponentially small as in the usual weak - coupling limit ( such as bcs approach ) .",
    "the main departure of the system that we consider here from previous studies of models on this type is that we will allow for the josephson couplings between the le liquids to have either positive or negative signs .",
    "a negative sign induces a @xmath7 phase shift between two neighboring le liquids .",
    "it was shown by berg _",
    "et al._@xcite that two superconductors that are proximity coupled to each other through a 1d weakly doped hubbard model have a broad regime of parameters ( in particular , doping ) in which the effective josephson coupling is negative . here , in order to incorporate this physics , we will introduce a set of ising degrees of freedom mediating the interactions between the le liquids which emulate different doping profiles of the electronic luttinger liquids .",
    "this feature will allow us to consider the interplay between uniform ( s - wave or d - wave ) superconductivity with pdw superconducting states and coexistence phases , resulting in complex phase diagrams .",
    "we note that inhomogeneous sc states such as the pdw are generally accompanied by a subsidiary charge - ordered state , a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) .",
    "the period of the cdw is twice the period of the pdw or equal to the period of the pdw depending on whether this is a pure pdw state or if it is a state in which it coexists with an uniform sc state .",
    "the cdw order parameters which describe these states are composite of the pdw order parameters with or without the uniform sc order parameter .",
    "the general occurrence of charge - ordered states as subsidiary orders of an inhomogeneous sc state has been emphasized by several authors.@xcite the same should hold in the case of the sc states that we study here .",
    "the experimental consequences of the pdw states have been discussed extensively in the recent literature@xcite ( including papers by one of the authors ) and we will not elaborate further on this questions here . instead we will focus on microscopic mechanisms behind these inherently strongly interacting states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we define our model and summarize our notation for bosonization in 1d . in section [ sec : mft ]",
    "we develop the interchain mft and discuss the results for the self consistent equations .",
    "in section [ sec : llsystems ] we study and discuss the quasiparticle spectrum of the phases , emergent from this quasi-1d system , for the various pdw and uniform sc states found in section [ sec : mft ] . in section [ sec : phases ] we summarize other possible phases that could arise in this model using a qualitative scaling dimensional analysis .",
    "we finish with our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the quasi-1d model , schematically presented in the introduction , consists of two different types of 1d systems .",
    "one of them is a conventional 1d electronic luttinger liquid ( ell ) in which both the spin and charge degrees of freedom are gapless .",
    "the other type , however , is a 1d system with a spin gap , i.e. , it is a 1d luther - emery liquid ( le ) .",
    "the presence of the spin gap in the 1d system will bias the full array of 1d systems to a strong tendency to a sc state .      before we define in detail the quasi-1d model , we start with a short summary on those 1d liquids and their description using bosonization .",
    "this material is standard and can be found in several textbooks , e.g. ref .",
    "[ ] . here we will only give some salient results and set up our definitions ( and conventions ) that we use in later sections .",
    "we start with a 1d ell which has a gapless charge sector and a gapless spin sector .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian is written in terms of the set of the bosonic fields , @xmath8 where @xmath9 labels the charge and spin sectors respectively .",
    "these fields satisfy canonical equal - time commutation relations @xmath10 = i \\delta_{a , b } \\delta(x'-x)\\ ] ] the effective hamiltonian for the ell is @xmath11 = \\sum_{a = c , s } \\frac{v_\\alpha}{2 } \\left [ k_a ( \\partial_x \\theta_a)^{2 } + \\frac{1}{k_a } ( \\partial_x \\phi_a)^2 \\right ] ,   \\label{ll}\\ ] ] in which @xmath12 ( again with @xmath13 ) are the luttinger parameters for the charge and spin sectors , and @xmath14 are the characteristic speeds for the charge and spin excitations of the liquid .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined by the microscopic details of the model . however , for a system with spin - rotational invariance , the resulting su(2 ) symmetry restricts the value of the the spin luttinger parameter to be @xmath19 . in this continuum and low - energy limit",
    ", we can decompose the electronic field operator in terms of two slowly varying components , with wave vectors near the two fermi points @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ultraviolet cut - off ( typically the lattice spacing ) , and where @xmath23 denotes the spin of the electron . here",
    "the fermionic fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the right- and left - moving components of the electron field @xmath26 , which are slowly varying in space relative to the fermi momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the right- and left - moving fields can be written in terms of the bosonic charge fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the spin fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as follows @xmath32 the anticommuting klein factors , @xmath33 , ensure the fermionic statistics between the right and left moving fermions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "next we consider a spin - gapped luttinger liquid , or le liquid . at energy scales below the spin gap @xmath36 , the spin sector can be ignored .",
    "hence , the low - energy hamiltonian contains only the charge fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and it is given by @xmath37 = \\frac{v_c}{2 } \\left [ k_c ( \\partial_x \\theta_c)^{2 } + \\frac{1}{k_c } ( \\partial_x \\phi_c)^2 \\right ] .",
    "\\label{le}\\ ] ] since the spin sector has been effectively projected - out , we will keep only the charge sector of the le liquid and drop its @xmath38 label .    in the le liquid , all interactions represented by operators that are not spin singlets are irrelevant ( and , in fact , with effective scaling dimension infinite ) .",
    "this fact strongly restricts the types of interactions between le systems and ell systems . in this case",
    "the only fermion bilinears that need to be considered in the le liquid are the order parameter of the charge - density - wave with momentum @xmath39 ( cdw ) @xmath40 and the ( cooper ) pair field spin singlet superconducting order parameter    @xmath41    hence the coupling to the le liquids in the quasi-1d model should involve only the two operators listed above .",
    "we note that the suppression of the spin operator and the power - law correlation for the sc operator make the le liquids the natural building blocks for the quasi-1d sc state .",
    "in contrast , the ell has other observables that need to be considered , including a spin triplet pair field , the @xmath39 spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ` nel ' order parameter , the right and left moving spin current operators , and , in tunneling processes , the electron operators .",
    "given a set of independent 1d le and ell systems that were described above , we now define and discuss the full quasi-1d model .",
    "the model consists of an array of 1d systems shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_chains ] . each _ unit cell _ of the array consists of one le system , labeled by @xmath42 , and one ell system , labeled by @xmath43 . hence we introduce the bosonic fields @xmath44 representing the charge fields in the le chain of the @xmath45-th unit cell and also @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) representing the charge and spin fields in the ell chain of the @xmath45-th unit cell .",
    "furthermore we assume that the filling of the type b system ( an ell chain ) is close to half filling , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "also the spin rotational symmetry in the b systems is assumed to be unbroken and thus @xmath50 .",

    "the emergent sc state is determined by the josephson coupling @xmath58 and the subsequent sc state of the full system follows by proximity effect between the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 subsystems .",
    "this was the strategy used by granth _",

    "the first assumption is not a problem since we will do mean field theory assuming that the resulting modulation ( if any ) is unidirectional .",
    "more microscopically we will need to assume that the ising model has frustrated nearest and next nearest neighbor interactions along one direction only .",

[ ] , once the pdw state sets in there is always a ( subdominant ) cdw order state with twice the ordering wave - vector as that of the pdw .",
