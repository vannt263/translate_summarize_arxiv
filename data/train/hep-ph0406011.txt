    "<S> we have recently shown that the large direct @xmath0 violation observed in the decay @xmath1 , and the enhanced branching ratio for @xmath2 , can be understood by invoking a small mixing of the @xmath3 system with the dominant @xmath4 channel . </S>",

    "<S> a typical estimate is @xmath22 , which implies a branching ratio @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the notable feature of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ampfleischer ] ) is the equality of the decay rates of @xmath24 and @xmath7 , as well as equal @xmath0-violating asymmetries between @xmath24 and @xmath6 , and between @xmath7 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> also notable is the suppression of the decay @xmath26 ( which persists even after inclusion of annihilation contributions , the branching ratio being @xmath27 @xcite ) .    of particular interest to us is the term @xmath18 in eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ ampfleischer ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation comes from a recent analysis of the decay channels @xmath45 @xcite , in which we showed that a mixing of the strong - interaction channels @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the isospin @xmath46 state helps to resolve the puzzling observations of large direct @xmath0 violation in @xmath47 @xcite and an enhanced branching ratio for @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a natural explanation for these correlated effects in terms of final - state interactions in systems of physical hadrons , which respect the strong - interaction conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> experiment @xcite shows that @xmath4 systems are produced with large branching ratio ( i.e. large decay amplitude , proportional to @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> production of such systems in a real intermediate state , followed by a small mixing into the final state , results in an important imaginary contribution to the decay amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to asymmetries , and can enhance an ( initially suppressed ) branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the same physical idea will be implemented here , via the mixing of @xmath4 and @xmath43 states with the same strong - interaction quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of the @xmath4 as an intermediate state in the decay @xmath31 acts as a long - distance substitute for the @xmath28 contribution in the qcd penguin loop parametrized by @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> since the discussion is on the level of physical hadronic channels , no reference is made to the uncertain variable @xmath30 , which appears in the short - distance contribution . </S>",
    "<S> here we deal with the contributions to individual exclusive decays , of empirically - established @xcite , real intermediate states of physical hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain different , correlated results for asymmetries and branching ratios .    mixing occurs between the following pairs of states , possessing definite strong - interaction quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 as a consequence , the physical decay amplitudes of @xmath51 to these states are @xcite @xmath52 here @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 denote the  bare \" decay amplitudes , in the absence of final - state interactions . the mixing effects are contained in the rescattering matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the strong - interaction @xmath61 matrices between the pairs of states given in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ statesinbrackets ] ) . in the limit in which the elastic phase shifts for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are neglected </S>",
