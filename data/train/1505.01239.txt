    "blazars are the most luminous persistent objects in the sky ( up to @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they exhibit variability across the electromagnetic spectrum on timescales ranging from minutes to years ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "blazars constitute a sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) whose relativistic plasma jets are thought to be closely aligned to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the emission from blazars is predominantly non - thermal , including radio synchrotron radiation and x - ray and @xmath0-ray inverse - compton scattering .",
    "the central engines of blazars , which are believed to be the ultimate source of this variability , are unresolved and opaque to radio waves .",
    "hence , they are not imaged directly , even with the @xmath5 mas resolution obtained with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 43 ghz . despite this limitation , by monitoring and subsequently modeling flares in the high - energy emission from these agn , we can potentially gain insight into the sub - parsec - scale physics of the jets close to the central engines .",
    "many theoretical models have been developed to explain both the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and high - energy variability of blazars .",
    "the seds of most blazars take the form of two humps - one in the radio / uv portion of the spectrum ( synchrotron ) and the other at higher energies in the x - ray/@xmath0-ray portion of the spectrum ( interpreted here as inverse - compton emission ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite proposed that shock acceleration within the jet could result in the observed variations in radio emission .",
    "@xcite presented a leptonic model in which the high - energy hump of the sed is produced by comptonization of accretion disk photons by electrons contained within a plasmoid ( `` blob '' ) moving relativistically along the jet .",
    "alternatively , @xcite formulated a hadronic model in which the high - energy hump is produced through @xmath6 pion production from relativistic protons within the jet encountering both internal and external photon fields .",
    "@xcite also explored the effects of comptonization of external radiation fields from the accretion disk and the surrounding broad emission - line region ( blr ) by electrons within the jet .",
    "@xcite presented an internal shock model for blazar variability in which shells of plasma within the jet collide , producing forward and reverse shocks that result in particle acceleration within the jet . while these models can explain many aspects of the radiative mechanisms potentially at work in blazars , there remain aspects of high - energy variability that are not accounted for by these theories .",
    "recent observations obtained with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) and the vlba have shown that a large number of @xmath0-ray flares in blazars are strongly correlated with the passage of superluminal knots through the radio cores of these objects @xcite .",
    "the majority of these @xmath0-ray flares tend to be associated with flares detected at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "the high cadence of observations provided by the _ fermi _ spacecraft , however , has also allowed the identification of a small sub - set of @xmath0-flares that seem to occur in relative isolation , with little or no variability detected in the other bands .",
    "these isolated events are termed `` orphan '' flares . in one case , @xcite present observations of an orphan @xmath0-ray flare that occurred during the passage of a superluminal knot through the inner jet of the blazar pks 1510@xmath1089 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    based on the orphan @xmath0-ray flare highlighted in figure [ fig1 ] , here",
    "we develop a model of blazar variability to account for this type of behavior .",
    "in our model , a blob consisting of a power - law distribution of electrons propagates relativistically along the jet axis of the blazar and passes through a synchrotron - emitting ring of electrons , which represents a shocked segment of a more slowly moving jet sheath ( see figure [ fig2 ] and the sketch presented in figure [ fig9 ] below ) .",
    "the ring creates a very localized source of seed photons that are inverse - compton scattered by the electrons in the moving blob , creating an orphan @xmath0-ray flare as the blob passes through the ring .",
    "we point out that our model is distinct from compton mirror models ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) that require a reflecting cloud close to the jet axis to produce @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "the presence of a non- to mildly - relativistic sheath of plasma enshrouding the relativistic spine of a blazar jet has been discussed by several authors . from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", @xcite investigated the radiative interplay between these two regions within the jet via the inverse - compton mechanism .",
    "more recently , the seds of several blazars have been fit with models that utilize the presence of a jet sheath ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite discuss the potential of sheaths of plasma within blazars to produce the high - energy neutrinos being detected by icecube .",
    "several authors have also discussed what the observational signature of a sheath of plasma would be within a blazar jet ( see * ? ? ?",
    "velocity shear between the jet and the ambient medium into which the jet propagates is expected to align the magnetic field on the outer edges of the jet with the jet axis so that the sheath polarization should be high ( tens of percent ) relative to the spine .",
    "the electric vector position angles ( evpas ) associated with this polarization should be perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "this polarimetric signature has indeed been detected in a number of blazars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we present polarimetric observations of pks 1510@xmath1089 that point to the existence of a jet sheath within this blazar , lending support to our model of orphan @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we outline the theory relating to the radiative transfer modeled in our code . in ",
    "3 we describe the numerical simulation performed and list all of our model parameters . in ",
    "4 we compare synthetic light curves produced by the model to the observed optical and @xmath0-ray light curves of the orphan flare of pks 1510@xmath1089 . in  5 we present vlba polarimetric observations that point to the existence of a jet sheath within pks 1510@xmath1089 . in  6 we present our conclusions and summary .",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "models of blazar emission , whether leptonic or hadronic , rely on the presence of an emission region ( a `` blob '' ) moving relativistically along the jet .",
    "for the purposes of this work we adopt the leptonic scenario and treat the blob ( and ring ) as consisting of electrons with a power - law energy distribution , @xmath10 , over the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 , where the energy of a given electron is @xmath13 .",
    "there are three main components of the non - thermal emission produced by the passage of a blob of plasma down the spine of a jet in our model .",
    "the first is synchrotron radiation ( syn ) produced by electrons gyrating around magnetic field lines within the blob .",
    "these electrons also inverse - compton scatter the synchrotron photons they produce , a process known as synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission .",
    "the third component is inverse - compton scattering of the external ( to the blob ) ring synchrotron photons by the blob s electrons , a process known as external compton scattering ( ec ) .",
    "as the blob approaches the ring , the photon density in the co - moving frame of the plasma increases , resulting in an ec driven @xmath0-ray flare that peaks and decays as the blob passes through and then moves away from the ring .",
    "the photon production rates @xmath14 for these three physical processes , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , are given below ( @xmath18 is defined as a dimensionless photon energy ) . in our radiative transfer code , we evaluate these photon production rates in the co - moving frame of the blob , after which a series of lorentz transformations is applied to obtain the resultant flux in the observer s frame . in all of the following equations ,",

    "the ring of sheath plasma in our model , however , is located upstream of the radio core in pks 1510@xmath1089 . in particular , the radio knot correlated with the orphan flare was traveling down the jet at @xmath150 in our frame @xcite . from figure [ fig1 ] , it is apparent that the onset of the orphan flare preceded the large optical flare associated with the knot passing the radio core by about 20 days . assuming that the knot moved at this observed rate along the jet for those 20 days",

    "this locates our emission region between the two commonly considered regions of @xmath0-ray production in blazar jets , namely , the near - dissipation region ( @xmath154 ) , where the external photon fields are dominated by emission from a dusty torus and the blr , and the far - dissipation region ( @xmath155 ) near the core seen at 43 ghz . at this distance , utilizing the dimensions of our ring as corresponding to the jet sheath , we compute a sheath opening angle of @xmath156 ( where @xmath157 ) .",

    "constant magnetic fields are taken to permeate both the blob ( @xmath79 ) and the ring ( @xmath88 ) with the values used in the simulation listed in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "since we assume equipartition , this implies that @xmath173 .",
    "in addition , a lower magnetic field within the blob is needed to keep the radiative losses experienced by the blob electrons out of the fast cooling regime ( see equation ( [ eq13 ] ) ) ; however , the value used in our simulation ( @xmath174 ) is at odds with the observed value of @xmath175 for pks 1510@xmath1089 reported in @xcite .",
    "this difference in field strength might be reconciled by the fact that , as discussed above , we treat the ring as being located upstream of the radio core in pks 1510@xmath1089 .",
    "it is consistent for the magnetic fields in the jet upstream of the core to be smaller if indeed the core at 43 ghz is associated with a recollimation shock that amplifies the field strength through shock compression ( see figure [ fig9 ] below ) .",

    "these values are based on the observed properties of pks 1510@xmath1089 and yield a projected scale of @xmath182 .",
    "to better fit the observed light curves presented in figure [ fig1 ] , we include a baseline flux in each band , which is added to the variable emission produced by the model .",
    "these baseline fluxes , listed in table [ tab1 ] , reflect the more slowly varying emission from the jet plasma and are approximated to be constant .",
    "finally , the time step is chosen so that 24 samplings of the sed are made by the end of the simulation of the blob passing through the ring .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows an sed produced by the model during the peak of the simulated orphan @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "the three non - thermal emission components included in the calculation are differentiated by color .",
    "the model broadly reproduces the observed optical and @xmath0-ray peaks of pks 1510@xmath1089 s sed ( shown in black ) , but does not reproduce the observed optical - ultraviolet excess ( known as the big blue bump ) , nor the observed x - ray flux levels . the former spectral feature is believed to be associated with emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central engine , while the latter may be ssc emission from regions farther down the jet ( as indicated by the weak correlation between the x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves ; see @xcite ) .",
    "neither of these components are included in the calculation , hence these spectral features are absent from the synthetic seds produced by the model .",
    "the resultant @xmath0-ray and optical light curves produced by the blob s passage through the ring are shown in figure [ fig4 ] ( highlighted in red ) overlaid upon the observed data from @xcite . in particular , the baseline flux level ( as discussed in  3 ) is demarcated by the black dashed line in each plot , whereas the variable emission produced by the model is indicated by the black dotted line .",
    "the superposition of these two lines in each plot creates the synthetic light - curves shown in red .",
    "the synthetic light curves reproduce , in general , the observed orphan @xmath0-ray flare without exceeding the observed optical flux during the flare .",
    "the lack of a strong optical flare demonstrates the model s key ability to produce orphan @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "the peak flux in the simulated @xmath0-ray flare occurs when the blob is at a distance of @xmath183 downstream of the ring .",
    "this is a result of the interplay between the doppler boost gained by the relativistic motion of the blob , the external ring photon density within the co - moving frame of the blob , and the effects of radiative cooling .",
    "it should be pointed out that there is a small optical `` bump '' in our synthetic light curve ( lower panel of figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this gradual increase in emission is a result of the doppler boost gained by the blob s acceleration along the spine of the jet .",
    "the model s ability to produce @xmath0-ray flares with steep rise and decay times ( as illustrated in the upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] ) reflects the anisotropic source of seed photons used in the simulation ( i.e. , the ring ) .",
    "this is in contrast to other structured jet models that invoke isotropic seed photon fields from a continuous jet sheath .",

    "[ fig5 ] , a series of comparative light curves is shown illustrating the effect that different blob accelerations ( or lack of acceleration ) have on the orphan flares produced by this model .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig5 ] that by varying the blob s acceleration through the ring , this model is able to produce orphan flares both with steeper and more gradual onsets and decays .",
    "the differences in these light curves highlight the potential to use the observed shape of orphan @xmath0-ray flares to infer the nature of the acceleration of the emission region through blazar jets upstream of the 43 ghz core .",
    "the presence of a sheath of plasma surrounding the spine of a blazar jet is a central component to our model of orphan @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "several authors have discussed what the observational signature of a jet sheath within a blazar would be ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they posit that a jet sheath represents a shear layer between the plasma of the jet and the ambient medium into which the jet propagates . in this scenario ,",
    "the initially helical or chaotic magnetic field lines of the outer layers of the jet are `` stretched '' out due to the velocity gradient between the jet and the ambient medium .",
    "this shear , if it exists , would result in a buildup of magnetic field on the outer edges of the jet , with the orientation of that field aligned nearly parallel to the jet boundary @xcite .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field within a blazar is inferred from the orientation of the evpas measured by the vlba , which , barring the effects of opacity and relativistic aberration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are assumed to be perpendicular to the projection of the magnetic field onto the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , the observational signature of a jet sheath would be an increase in the fractional polarization toward the edges of the jet , with the evpa perpendicular to the jet boundary , and therefore roughly perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "we point out that an alternative interpretation ( as discussed in @xcite ) is that the evpa being perpendicular to the jet boundary is the result of the jet flow carrying a large scale helical magnetic field",

    "* ) across the width of the jet of pks 1510@xmath1089 , would potentially be able to distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "we adopt the prior interpretation for this paper .",
    "a complication in detecting the polarimetric signature of a jet sheath within a blazar is discussed by @xcite . due to the effects of doppler beaming ,",
    "the relativistic spine of the jet ( @xmath184 ) is intrinsically far brighter than the surrounding sheath ( which is usually assumed to be non- to mildly - relativistic : @xmath185 ) . to overcome this vast difference in intrinsic brightness ,",
    "several authors have implemented a method of `` stacking '' radio maps ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this stacking method involves aligning individual radio images of a blazar based on the location of the radio core ( which is assumed to be an essentially stationary feature within the jet at a given frequency ) .",
    "the images are then added together , with the expectation that noise and transient phenomena ( such as superluminal blobs ) will smooth out in the stacked map , and , in contrast , any standing features within the jet ( such as a jet sheath ) will be highlighted as more images are added to the stacked map . with this in mind , we stacked vlba total intensity and polarization images of pks 1510@xmath1089 at 43 ghz in order to see whether the polarimetric signature of a jet sheath is present in this blazar .",
    "in particular , we selected images from twenty epochs of observation from 2008 to 2013 made with vlba data from the vlba - bu - blazar program ( see www.bu.edu/blazars/vlbaproject.html and @xcite for a general description of the observations and data analysis ) .",
    "the chosen epochs correspond to periods of relatively quiescent jet activity .",
    "our stacked map for pks 1510@xmath1089 is shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "we do see an increase in the degree of polarization toward the edges of the jet .",
    "the evpas plotted in figure [ fig6 ] are inclined to the jet spine axis ( highlighted in red ) and are predominantly perpendicular to that axis ( as predicted by the sheath scenario ) in both the southern half and the upper northern half of the jet .",
    "we examine ten transverse slices through the data ( shown in blue ) .",
    "the variations of the stokes parameters along the first slice are shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "we indeed find that the fractional polarization increases toward the edges of the jet , as predicted by the sheath scenario .",
    "these two features , namely , the increase in fractional polarization and the orientation of that polarization perpendicular to the jet axis , are consistent with a sheath in pks 1510@xmath1089 .",
    "the variations of the stokes parameters along the other nine slices are qualitatively similar to the first , with the exception that after the fifth slice we no longer see signs of a sheath component in the southern half of the jet .",
    "the total and polarized intensity profiles along the slices ( highlighted in figure [ fig7 ] ) are used to determine the nominal location of the sheath within the jet , as illustrated in figure [ fig8 ] . in particular",
    ", we align the total intensity and polarized intensity profiles for each slice and use the double - peaked nature of the polarized intensity ( a signature of the jet sheath ) to highlight the location of the sheath within each slice ( the shaded gray regions shown in figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the width of the sheath on each side of the slice is determined , arbitrarily , by the location where the polarized flux falls below 0.85 times the peak value ( the solid black vertical lines in figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this percentage yields a conservative estimate of the extent of the sheath .",
    "the total intensity of the sheath plasma on each side of the jet is approximated by the values of the total intensity profile ( the red circles in figure [ fig8 ] ) that are aligned with the peaks of the polarized intensity profile ( the dashed black vertical lines in figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we then repeat this procedure for each slice throughout our stacked map , thus tracing out the sheath ( shaded gray regions shown in figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "an estimate of the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath186 ) of the sheath in the observer s frame is computed by adding all of the flux contained within the gray shaded regions of our stacked map ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "based on the distance to pks 1510@xmath1089 , we convert this inferred sheath flux at 43 ghz into a spectral luminosity ( @xmath187 ) and assume a power - law of the form @xmath188 . after solving for the constant of proportionality ( @xmath189 )",
    ", we then integrate to obtain : @xmath190 where we have assumed a spectral index of @xmath191 ( in rough agreement with the mean spectral index of a large sample of flat spectrum radio quasar jets found by @xcite ) and limits of integration of @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity between this value and the value obtained in  3 for the upstream sheath luminosity using equation ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "the above estimate indicates that the sheath within pks 1510@xmath1089 is potentially a very important source of seed photons even at parsec scales along the jet . as a further comparison , we compute the bolometric luminosity ( in the observer s frame ) of the ring of sheath plasma in our model assuming , in contrast to the simulation , that the ring moves along the jet with a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath194 .",
    "we find @xmath195 , roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the above sheath estimate .",
    "finally , a crude estimate of both the inner ( @xmath59 ) and outer ( @xmath60 ) radii of the sheath was made by averaging the values obtained for these parameters relative to the jet spine ( demarcated by the dashed red vertical line in figure [ fig8 ] ) for each slice through the stacked map .",
    "we find that @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "these values are roughly a factor of @xmath198 larger than the inner and outer radii used in our model of the ring ( see table [ tab1 ] ) that we posit to exist upstream of the region highlighted in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the opening angle of the sheath used in our model ( @xmath199 as discussed in  3 ) predicts that @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the sheath at a distance of @xmath202 from the central engine , which is roughly the scale where the radio core is situated in our stacked map at 43 ghz @xcite .",
    "although the plasma in this sheath needs to move relativistically for beaming to allow us to detect it , given this transverse velocity gradient , we infer the presence of an even slower sheath upstream , where the ring in our model could be located ( as discussed in  3 and illustrated in figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "an enhancement , such as a ring of shocked plasma , in this more slowly moving sheath of plasma could potentially supply the seed photons that our model requires to explain the observed orphan flares within pks 1510@xmath1089 .",
    "we have developed a model to explain the origins of orphan @xmath0-ray flares from blazars and have applied this model to a specific orphan flare within the blazar pks 1510@xmath1089 . in this model , a shocked segment of a slow jet sheath provides a localized source of seed photons that are inverse - compton scattered by electrons contained within a blob of plasma moving relativistically along the spine of the jet .",
    "this inverse - compton scattering results in the production of a sharply peaked orphan @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "synthetic light curves produced by this model are able to reproduce the general features of the observed @xmath0-ray light curve during an orphan flare event associated with the ejection of a superluminal knot from the base of the jet of pks 1510@xmath1089 .",
    "the model is also able to reproduce the double - peaked profile seen in the seds of most blazars .",
    "this model can potentially be used to discern the nature of the motion of the blob along the spine of the jet based on the shape of the observed orphan flare .",
    "we have stacked radio images of pks 1510@xmath1089 obtained with the vlba at 43 ghz at multiple epochs .",
    "we find the polarimetric signature of a sheath in our stacked map , thus lending observational support to the plausibility of this model of orphan @xmath0-ray flares within blazars . in the future",
    ", we plan to extend our modeling efforts in an attempt to reproduce orphan @xmath0-ray flares observed in the blazars 3c 273 , 3c 279 , and 4c 71.07 .",
    "we also plan to create stacked maps of the jets of these objects to investigate whether we can detect additional spine - sheath polarimetric signatures .",
