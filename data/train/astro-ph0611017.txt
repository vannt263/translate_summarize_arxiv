    "clusters of galaxies , occurring at low redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , are interesting cosmological objects as they offer a powerful yet independent approach from other methods ( such as the cosmic microwave background , at @xmath6 ) for constraining cosmological parameters . while several cosmological applications of clusters exist , a particularly appealing method , because of its simplicity , is to measure the variation in the cluster mass function with redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since mass is known to be tightly correlated with x - ray observables , particularly temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is straightforward in principle to convert between the two quantities .",
    "theoretically , such cluster scaling relations were predicted to exist , essentially as a manifestation of the virial theorem , by @xcite . in the",
    "so - called _ gravitational - heating _ scenario , the intracluster medium ( icm ) was heated by the gravitational collapse and subsequent virialisation of the cluster .",
    "x - ray observations of clusters confirmed the existence of these scaling relations ( e.g. @xcite for the x - ray luminosity  temperature relation ) though they revealed two complications .",
    "firstly , the slope of the observed x - ray luminosity  temperature relation ( and to a lesser extent , the mass  temperature relation ) is steeper than predicted from gravitational heating alone , an effect shown by @xcite to be due to an excess of entropy in the cores of clusters , and more so in groups .",
    "a lot of theoretical effort has gone into understanding the origin of the excess entropy ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "secondly , there is an intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations , which is particularly large for the low - redshift luminosity  temperature relation , due to the large variations in core luminosity @xcite .",
    "for cosmological studies with clusters , an accurate statistical description of the cluster population is warranted , as only then can robust cluster survey selection functions be constructed . from a theoretical stand - point ,",
    "cluster scaling relations offer an additional , exciting prospect ; the amount with which these relations evolve with redshift ought to reveal information on the nature of non - gravitational processes and cluster astrophysics in general @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in cluster scaling relations can at least partly be attributed to gravitational processes , as clusters themselves live in different environments ( e.g.  @xcite ) , although non - gravitational processes , such as radiative cooling and heating from galaxies , must also play a role ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological simulations of the cluster population are the most accurate method by which to characterise the statistical properties of clusters , as they include an accurate treatment of the non - linear gravitational dynamics and merging processes , as well as allowing non - gravitational physics to be incorporated self - consistently .",
    "early attempts focused on the simplest model for the gas , a non - radiative icm , which was successfully shown to reproduce the simple , self - similar , scalings expected from the gravitational - heating model ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "additional non - gravitational processes have also been studied within simulations , and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the similarity breaking , such as _ preheating _",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , radiative cooling ( e.g.  @xcite ) or both ( e.g. @xcite ) . recently",
    ", attention has shifted to more realistic models which attempt to directly couple feedback ( local heating from galaxies ) with cooling and star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    together with progress in the development of these non - gravitational models ,",
    "the advance in both simulation codes and computer hardware is now allowing larger simulations with reasonable resolution to be performed .",
    "we are now beginning to resolve sufficient numbers of clusters to start making quantitative predictions at all appropriate redshifts for the cluster population .",
    "the clef - ssh ( cluster evolution and formation in supercomputer simulations with hydrodynamics ) collaboration has been set up to take advantage of this new era in numerical modelling , by performing large simulations of the cluster population .",
    "our first simulation , known as the clef simulation , is a large ( @xmath7 ) @xmath0-body / sph simulation of the @xmath1cdm cosmology , within a @xmath8 box , and includes a model for radiative cooling and energy feedback from galaxies .",
    "this simulation is a similar size to the one performed by @xcite , but uses a different feedback model . in @xcite , hereafter paper  i",
    ", we presented a small selection of results at @xmath3 from the clef simulation .",
    "for this paper , we have performed a more detailed analysis of the same cluster population , and present results for a range of redshifts from @xmath3 to 1 , focusing on the effects of dynamical activity and the strength of cooling cores . a companion paper ( da silva et al .",
    ", in preparation ) presents results for the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect properties of the clef cluster population .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : sim ] we summarise details of the clef simulation and detail our method for creating cluster catalogues , maps and profiles .",
    "the internal structure of clusters , and how it depends on dynamical regularity and the properties of the core , is the focus of section  [ sec : structure ] .",
    "section  [ sec : scale ] then draws on these results to investigate the evolution of key cluster scaling relations with redshift .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sec : disc ] and summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the clef simulation is a large ( @xmath7 particles within a @xmath9 comoving box ) cosmological simulation of structure formation , incorporating both dark matter and gas . below we describe the procedure used to generate the simulation data and how the clusters were identified within these data to create x - ray temperature - limited samples from redshifts @xmath3 to @xmath4 .      for the cosmological model",
    ", we adopted the spatially - flat @xmath1cdmcosmology , setting the following values for cosmological parameters : matter density parameter , @xmath10 ; cosmological constant , @xmath11 ; baryon density parameter , @xmath12 ; hubble constant , @xmath13 ; primordial power spectrum index , @xmath14 and power spectrum normalisation , @xmath15 .",
    "these values were chosen to be consistent with the results from _ wmap _ first year data @xcite .",
    "initial conditions were generated for a cube of comoving length @xmath16 at redshift , @xmath17 .",
    "the cube was populated with two interleaving grids of @xmath18 particles , one grid representing the dark matter and one representing the gas ; the particle masses were thus set to @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the dark matter and gas respectively .",
    "initial particle displacements and velocities were then computed from a transfer function generated using the cmbfast code @xcite .",
    "the initial temperature of the gas was set to @xmath21k , significantly lower than the range of temperatures typical of overdense structures resolved by the simulation .",
    "the initial conditions were evolved to @xmath3 using a version of the gadget2 @xmath0-body / sph code @xcite , modified to include additional physical processes ( radiative cooling , star formation and energy feedback ; see below ) .",
    "gravitational forces were calculated using the particle - mesh algorithm on large scales ( using a @xmath22 fft ) and the hierarchical tree method on small scales .",
    "the ( equivalent ) plummer softening length was set to @xmath23 , fixed in comoving co - ordinates , thus softening the newtonian force law below a comoving separation , @xmath24 .",
    "gas particles were additionally subjected to adiabatic forces , and an artificial viscosity where the flow was convergent , using the entropy - conserving version of sph @xcite , the default method in gadget2 . additionally , we allowed gas particles with @xmath25k to cool radiatively , using the isochoric cooling approximation suggested by @xcite .",
    "tabulated cooling rates were taken from @xcite , assuming an optically thin @xmath26 plasma in collisional ionisation equilibrium ( a good approximation to the intracluster medium out to at least @xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have also attempted to follow crudely the large - scale effects of galactic outflows ( feedback ) in the simulation , to regulate the cooling rate and to inject non - gravitational energy into the gas .",
    "we adopted the _",
    "strong feedback _ model of @xcite , hereafter k2004a , as it was shown there to approximately reproduce the observed excess entropy in groups / clusters , both at small and large radii ( see also paper  i ) .",
    "we only give a brief summary of the model details here .",
    "first of all , cooled gas is identified with overdensity @xmath27 , hydrogen density @xmath28 , and temperature @xmath29k .",
    "for each cooled gas particle , a random number , @xmath30 , is drawn from the unit interval and the gas is reheated if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the reheated mass fraction parameter .",
    "reheated gas is given a fixed amount of entropy , , where @xmath33 is the ratio of specific heats for a monatomic ideal gas and @xmath34 is the mean atomic weight of a fully - ionised plasma . ]",
    "@xmath35 , corresponding to a minimum thermal energy of @xmath36kev at the star - formation density threshold .",
    "such a high thermal energy ( compared with typical cluster virial temperatures ) means that the reheated gas is supersonic and is thus distributed through viscous interactions and shocks in the icm .",
    "this not only regulates the star - formation rate in the cluster @xcite , it also prevents significant build - up of low - entropy material in the cluster core @xcite .",
    "our model could thus be perceived as a crude representation of local accretion - triggered heating by stars and active galactic nuclei ( although feedback from the latter does not necessarily have to follow the star - formation rate , as is done here ) .",
    "gas particles that are not reheated are instead converted to collisionless star particles . although the model does not treat star formation ( which occurs in regions with much higher gas densities , @xmath37 ) accurately , this premature removal of low - pressure material from the gas phase saves computational effort as these particles generally have the shortest timesteps .",
    "furthermore , it helps to alleviate the difficulty that standard sph has in resolving the sharp interface between hot and cold phases @xcite .",
    "the clef simulation produced a total of 72 snapshots of the particle data , at time intervals optimised for producing mock lightcones ( da silva et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . only the 25 lowest - redshift snapshots are used in this paper , ranging from @xmath3 to 1 ; at higher redshift the number of clusters becomes prohibitively small .",
    "we used these snapshots to produce cluster catalogues ( mass , radius and various other properties ) , maps and profiles .",
    "catalogues were generated using a similar procedure to that adopted by @xcite .",
    "briefly , groups of dark matter particles were identified using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite , setting the dimensionless linking - length to @xmath38 .",
    "spheres were then grown around the particle in each group with the most negative gravitational potential , until the enclosed mass equalled a critical value @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the density contrast , @xmath41 is the critical density and @xmath42 for a flat universe @xcite .",
    "cluster catalogues for a variety of density contrasts were constructed , including the virial value ( @xmath43 at @xmath3 ) , taken from equation  ( 6 ) in @xcite .",
    "the virial radius was used to find overlapping pairs , and the least massive cluster in each pair was discarded from the catalogues . for nearly all of the results presented in this paper , we use a catalogue with @xmath44 , as this is the smallest density contrast typically accessible to current x - ray observations .",
    "we initially selected all clusters with at least 3000 particles within @xmath45 , corresponding to a lower mass limit of @xmath46 .",
    "this limit is low enough that our temperature - selected sample ( below ) is comfortably a complete subset of this sample at all redshifts studied .",
    "at @xmath3 we have 641 clusters in our mass - limited sample , decreasing to 191 clusters at @xmath4 .",
    "this is comparable to the numbers found in the simulation performed by @xcite , who also used gadget2 but with a different prescription for cooling , star formation and feedback than used here .",
    "observational samples of x - ray clusters are usually limited in flux or temperature , where the latter is measured by fitting an isothermal plasma model to the observed spectrum of the cluster x - ray emission .",
    "theoretical models of x - ray clusters commonly use an emission - weighted temperature to estimate the spectral temperature of a cluster . for particle - based simulations ,",
    "this is done using the formula @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the weight given to each hot ( @xmath49 k ) gas particle @xmath50 , @xmath51 its mass , @xmath52 its density , @xmath53 its temperature and @xmath54 the cooling function , usually for emission within the x - ray energy band ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the bremsstrahlung regime @xmath55 and",
    "so the hottest , densest particles are given the most weight .",
    "@xcite applied the same method used by observers to measure the spectroscopic temperature of simulated clusters , and found that it was always lower than @xmath56 .",
    "for the bremsstrahlung regime ( @xmath2 kev ) , they suggested a more accurate measure , known as the _ spectroscopic - like _ temperature , with weight @xmath57 .",
    "this estimator gives the coldest , densest particles more weight .",
    "we adopt this estimator in this paper ( summing over gas particles within @xmath45 with @xmath58 kev , the typical lower energy limit of an x - ray band ) to create a temperature - limited ( @xmath59 kev ) sample of clusters at all redshifts .",
    "this reduces the number of clusters to 95 at @xmath3 , decreasing to 57 at @xmath4 . while this is one of the largest temperature - selected cluster sample drawn from a single simulation , we note that the dynamic range is still quite small .",
    "nearly all clusters have @xmath60 kev at all redshifts ( the median temperature stays approximately constant with redshift at @xmath61 kev ) and our hottest cluster at @xmath3 has @xmath62 kev .    ,",
    "plotted against spectroscopic - like temperature , @xmath63 , for clusters with @xmath59 kev .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath64 and the dashed line is the best - fit straight line to our data .",

    "rasia et al . found @xmath66 , whereas we find @xmath67 , similar to , although slightly steeper than , their result ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "cluster maps were produced using a similar procedure to that discussed in @xcite ; in essence , values at each pixel are the sum of smoothed contributions from particles , using the same spline kernel as used by the gadget2 code",
    ". centred on each cluster , only particles within a cube of half - length , @xmath68 , were considered , i.e. out to approximately twice the virial radius in each orthogonal direction .",
    "for this paper , we computed bolometric surface brightness ( although the emission is predominantly thermal bremsstrahlung in the x - ray ) and spectroscopic - like temperature maps",
    ". projected temperature and azimuthally - averaged surface - brightness profiles were also computed , averaging particles within cylindrical shells , centred on the pixel with the highest surface brightness .",
    "[ fig : sltimages ] illustrates spectroscopic - like temperature maps of the 5 most massive clusters each at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , out to a radius , @xmath45 .",
    "as was found by @xcite and @xcite , there is a large amount of temperature structure within each cluster , particularly cold spots due to cool , low - entropy gas trapped within infalling sub - clusters .",
    "the intensity scale is defined by the minimum and maximum temperature ; the dynamic range is typically an order of magnitude ( @xmath69 ) , with maximum temperatures being around twice that of the mean .",
    "in this section we present the structural properties of the clef clusters , comparing to observational data where appropriate .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the x - ray temperature of the icm is biased to regions of high density .",
    "cooling and heating processes are generally most efficient there , so the x - ray temperature of a cluster is not necessarily an accurate measure of the depth of the underlying gravitational potential well , even if the system is virialised and approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we investigate any such temperature bias in our simulation by comparing @xmath63 to the dynamical temperature , @xmath70 , through the standard quantity , @xmath71 . the dynamical temperature , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , assuming the ratio of specific heats for a monatomic ideal gas , @xmath33 , and the mean atomic weight of a zero metallicity gas , @xmath74 g. the first sum in the numerator runs over gas particles and the second sum over all particles , of mass @xmath51 , temperature @xmath53 and speed @xmath75 in the centre of momentum frame of the cluster .    , versus scaled mass , @xmath76 , at @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",

    "there is a clear positive correlation between @xmath77 and @xmath76 , with @xmath79 for most clusters ( i.e. @xmath80 ) at low and high redshift .",
    "the spectroscopic - like temperature is a biased tracer of the gravitational potential for three reasons .",
    "firstly , cool dense gas is weighted more than less dense material , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this effect can be seen in the figure by comparing @xmath77 to the best - fit relation when @xmath63 is replaced by the hot gas mass - weighted temperature ( dot - dashed line ) . secondly , some of the energy of the gas is in macroscopic kinetic energy , as can be deduced from comparing the dot - dashed to the dashed line , where in the latter case , @xmath63 is replaced by the temperature when equation  ( [ eqn : tdyn ] ) is applied to only the hot gas .",
    "finally , feedback heats the gas , particularly in low mass clusters ( the dashed line shows that @xmath81 for most clusters , i.e. the gas has more specific energy than the dark matter ) .       and .",
    "horizontal dashed lines illustrate mean values .",
    "the solid line is the average value measured by @xcite for their _ non - radiative _ clusters.,width=302 ]    we also examine the segregation of baryonic mass into gaseous ( icm ) and galactic ( collisionless ) components within each cluster .",
    "gas and baryon fraction profiles for this model have already been studied by @xcite , hereafter k2004b , who showed that the baryon fraction profiles were in good agreement with observations but that too much of the gas had turned into stars ( the normalisation of the gas fraction profile is as low as 50 per cent of the observed profile ) . here",
    "we examine the behaviour of the baryon / gas / star fractions with temperature and redshift .",
    "[ fig : bfrac ] illustrates baryon fractions normalised to the global value , @xmath82 within @xmath45 , for each cluster at @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "most of our clusters have @xmath83  kev , where there is a strong trend in increasing baryon fraction with temperature , as feedback can heat and expel more gas in smaller clusters . at high temperature ,",
    "a few systems at @xmath3 are consistent with the mean value ( @xmath84 ) found by k2004b for their non - radiative clusters .",
    "overall , the mean baryon fraction increases by 8 per cent between the two redshifts , from 0.71 at @xmath4 to 0.79 at @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the mean hot gas fraction increases from 0.42 to 0.49 over the same redshift range .",
    "@xcite also found the gas fractions to weakly decrease with redshift in their simulated clusters , albeit with higher values than found here .",
    "the star fraction is a very weak function of both temperature and redshift , with a mean value of 0.28 at @xmath3 and 0.29 at @xmath4 . just under 40 per cent of the baryons within @xmath45",
    "have condensed and formed stars in our simulation , at all redshifts ; a value that only decreases to about 30 per cent at the virial radius .",
    "observations indicate a value of about 10 to 15 per cent , significantly lower than in our clusters @xcite .",
    "thus , as found by k2004b , our feedback model has not been effective enough at limiting the overcooling of baryons in clusters , as was also found by @xcite .",
    "however , the global star fraction is only 13 per cent at @xmath3 ( and 9 per cent at @xmath4 ) , just slightly larger than the observed value of 5 to 10 per cent ( e.g.  @xcite ) .      , versus spectroscopic - like temperature for clusters at @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",

    "the solid horizontal line is the median @xmath87 and the dashed lines the 10 and 90 percentiles.,width=302 ]         hierarchical models of structure formation predict that substructures in clusters should be commonplace , as clusters are the latest result of a series of mergers of smaller systems , and have dynamical times ( @xmath88 gyr ) that are a significant fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "indeed , substructure is frequently observed in clusters and dynamical activity has been quantified using various techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we use a simple measure of substructure in our cluster surface - brightness maps , using the centroid - shift method similar to that suggested by @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the position of the pixel with maximum surface brightness ( taken to be the centre of the cluster ) and @xmath91 is the surface - brightness centroid .",
    "@xcite used a similar method , based on the 3d total mass distribution , and showed that this did as well , or better , than other more sophisticated measures of substructure in simulated clusters .",
    "[ fig : subtsl ] illustrates @xmath87 versus @xmath63 for our temperature - limited sample of clusters at @xmath4 ( top panel ) and @xmath3 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "it is evident that the range of @xmath87 values at fixed temperature is large : the 10 and 90 percentiles of each distribution , shown as horizontal dashed lines , vary from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "inspection of surface - brightness maps ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : subimages ] ) reveals that clusters with the largest @xmath87 appear dynamically disturbed and are therefore undergoing a major merger .",
    "we choose to divide our sample into _ irregular _ clusters with @xmath86 and _ regular _ clusters otherwise .",
    "we note that this division is somewhat arbitrary and only serves to provide us with a means to compare the most disturbed clusters at each redshift to the rest of the sample .",
    "the longer tail in the @xmath87 distribution to high values at @xmath3 exacerbates the difference between the two sub - populations relative to those at @xmath4 ( the length of the tail itself changes from redshift to redshift ) .",
    "there is no significant trend in @xmath87 with temperature , within the limited dynamic range of our sample .",

    "each temperature profile is normalised to the average spectroscopic - like temperature , @xmath95 , between projected radii of @xmath96 and @xmath45 .",

    "as was found in subsection  [ subsec : structparam ] , the dispersion in x - ray concentration decreases with redshift , such that at high redshift , clusters with strong cooling cores are absent .",

    "when the core is excised , the scatter is reduced at all redshifts and also evolves less .",
    "the normalisation also evolves less with redshift , demonstrating that some ( but not all ) of the deviation from the gravitational - heating case is due to processes occurring within the inner core .",
    "furthermore , since we know that the @xmath286 relation evolves very weakly with redshift , negative evolution in the @xmath287 relation is almost entirely due to a deficit in luminosity , again as seen in the entropy and surface - brightness profiles .",
    "a similar study was performed by @xcite , using the same simulation as @xcite .",

    "they found that the evolution of the @xmath138 relation varied enormously between the models .",
    "their conclusion was that the amount of evolution depended on the nature of non - gravitational processes .",

    "perhaps the most interesting result in this paper is that our simulation predicts a large scatter in the luminosity  temperature relation at low redshift , as observed , however this scatter decreases with redshift due to the lack of systems with high x - ray concentrations at @xmath290 . here",
    ", we discuss this issue in more detail and investigate further the differences between clusters with high and low x - ray concentrations , and cool and warm cores .      observed samples of ( generally low - redshift ) clusters are historically split into _ cooling - flow _ and _ non - cooling - flow _ systems ( e.g. @xcite ) , with the former having higher mass deposition rates , usually estimated from their core luminosity and temperature @xmath291 x - ray spectroscopy of cluster cores has revealed that significantly less gas in high @xmath292 clusters is actually cooling down to temperatures significantly below the mean temperature of the cluster .",
    "this lack of cold gas is likely attributed to intermittent heating from a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ; e.g. see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , it is important to understand the origin of the large spread in @xmath292 within the cluster population , as it also explains much of the scatter in the luminosity  temperature relation @xcite .    , versus x - ray concentration for regular ( triangles ) and irregular ( squares ) clusters at @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",

    "while the median @xmath114 decreases with redshift , the median @xmath292 stays approximately constant .",
    "the lack of strong _ cooling - flow _ clusters at high redshift is offset by the increase in @xmath292 for individual systems , due to the ratio , @xmath296 , being typically larger at higher redshift , thus capturing more of the cluster s luminosity . averaging over all redshifts , we found that @xmath297 .    here , we do not attempt to address the issue of how much gas is _ actually _ cooling down within our cluster cores .",
    "as discussed in k2004b , our simulations currently lack the number of particles to accurately follow the inward flow of the gas all the way down to low temperature .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate below , we find that the large range in x - ray concentration / cooling - flow strength exhibited by our clusters at low redshift is strongly dependent on the cluster s larger - scale environment , i.e. whether it experienced a late - time major merger or not .",

    "this view - point was recently challenged by @xcite as being overly - simplistic , as observations of both _ cooling - flow _ clusters with disturbed morphologies ( e.g. perseus ) and _ non - cooling - flow _ clusters ( e.g. 3c 129 ) with relaxed morphologies exist .",
    "our simulation lends some support to their argument , as fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotxfl ] shows . at @xmath3 ,",
    "irregular clusters are found to have a large range in @xmath114 ( or @xmath292 ) , with one irregular cluster ( @xmath298 ) having @xmath299 .",
    "conversely , regular clusters can also have very low x - ray concentrations ( @xmath300 ) .",
    "however , statistically , the average regular cluster has a higher x - ray concentration than an irregular cluster .",
    "this is because the x - ray concentration is related to the dynamical history of the cluster , as we will show below .",
    "we showed in subsection  [ subsec : structparam ] that @xmath114 is anti - correlated with the strength of the cool core , @xmath301 , as measured from the projected temperature profile ; clusters with the coolest cores have more concentrated x - ray emission .",
    "however , nearly all of our clusters , regular and irregular , have cool cores ( @xmath110 ; figs .",
    "[ fig : ftimages ] & [ fig : ftfl ] ) .",

    "interestingly , clusters with warm cores nearly always appear regular , even though the generation of a warm core appears linked to the merger process .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasthot ] , where we see a clear correlation between the redshift when a cluster last had a warm core , @xmath304 , against the nearest redshift when it was irregular ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath305 .",
    "it is unclear whether the cores are heated solely from the gravitational interaction of the merger , or a contribution comes from the feedback , which could also be triggered by a merger . nevertheless , the paucity of warm cores is at odds with the observational data at low redshift .",
    "for example , @xcite recently studied a flux - limited sample of 20 clusters observed with _",
    "chandra _ , and found only half of them to contain cool cores , even though the core gas in the warm core clusters have cooling times significantly shorter than a hubble time .",
    "the discrepancy is illustrated clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftdist ] , where we compare the distribution of @xmath301 values found in the clef simulation at @xmath3 with the observational data of @xcite .",
    "although based on a limited sample , the observations suggest there exists a bimodal distribution , not present in the simulation .",
    "this suggests that our simulation is still missing a heating mechanism that could produce a larger fraction of warm cores , which again could be linked to agn activity .",
    "relation versus x - ray concentration for clusters at @xmath3 .",
    "triangles are regular clusters and squares irregular clusters .",
    "solid triangles are clusters with the highest x - ray concentrations / x - ray - inferred mass deposition rates.,width=302 ]    we now examine why there is a large scatter in the @xmath138 relation at low redshift .",
    "classically , it is thought that the scatter is related to the dynamical histories of clusters . in particular , clusters with the strongest cooling flows ( which lie above the mean @xmath138 relation )",
    "are believed to be in that state because they have not endured a major merger in the recent past .",
    "our simulation supports this picture , as will be demonstrated in the following two figures .",
    "firstly , fig .",
    "[ fig : lbolfl ] explicitly shows that the scatter in the @xmath138 relation is tightly correlated with the x - ray concentration ( or mass deposition rate ) of a cluster . for regular systems ,",
    "clusters with higher x - ray concentrations lie above the mean relation , and those with low x - ray concentrations below .",
    "irregular clusters lie off this correlation because @xmath114 decreases due to the presence of a second object ( which also boosts the luminosity ) .     versus the lowest redshift when the cluster was irregular . only clusters in our temperature - selected sample at all available redshifts , @xmath306 , are plotted .",
    "triangles are regular clusters today and squares irregular clusters ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "asterisks are clusters with @xmath308 , i.e. they did not experience a major merger between now and @xmath4 . the dashed line is a best - fit relation to the regular clusters with @xmath309.,width=302 ]    secondly , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lastirr ] we plot x - ray concentration at @xmath3 versus the lowest redshift when each cluster experienced a major merger .",
    "clusters which are not present in our temperature - selected samples at all redshifts , @xmath306 are not plotted .",
    "clearly there is a strongly - positive correlation , demonstrating that the most concentrated systems did not experience a major merger in the recent past ( the asterisks are those clusters with @xmath310 ) .",
    "an alternative mechanism for generating the scatter was proposed by @xcite , who used semi - analytic models of clusters with preheating and cooling ( but the effects of accretion and merging of haloes were not included ) .",
    "they suggested that the position of a cluster on the luminosity  temperature relation was related to the level of preheating it received : clusters that experienced higher levels of preheating correspond to non - cooling - flow clusters ( i.e. low x - ray concentrations , here ) and vice - versa .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we tested whether the amount of feedback is correlated to the strength of the cooling core .",
    "such an effect should be seen through a trend of stellar mass fraction with @xmath114 , as our feedback model injects energy approximately in proportion to the star - formation rate .",
    "no trend is seen in our simulation , i.e. stellar mass fractions are similar between clusters with low and high x - ray concentrations .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that the strong cooling - flow population exists in our model at low redshift because of a lack of major merger activity in such systems at @xmath311 .",
    "the absence of strong cooling - flow systems at higher redshift , responsible for the decrease in the @xmath138 scatter , can therefore be attributed to the increase in the merger rate with redshift .",
    "the absence of strong cooling - flow clusters at high redshift in our model has important implications for cluster cosmology .",
    "large samples of x - ray clusters at high redshift are still in their infancy , although will start to become available over the next few years , such as from the _ xmm - newton _ cluster survey @xcite .    if our prediction is correct , it will have both positive and negative implications for cosmology . on the positive side ,",
    "the smaller scatter will allow for a simpler survey selection function , with incompleteness effects being less of a problem . on the negative side ,",
    "there is a lack of very luminous objects , so the number of high - redshift clusters above a given flux limit will be considerably less , reducing the overall power for specific surveys to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "interestingly , first observational results seem to support the lack of cooling - flow systems at high redshift @xcite .",
    "another interesting point that our result throws up , is whether strong cooling - flow clusters would exist in a universe with @xmath312 ?",
    "in such a model , the merger rate would be expected to change very little with redshift , so clusters today may not have had the time to establish a strong cool core . in other words ,",
    "the strongest cooling - flow clusters only exist because of the freeze - out of structure formation in a universe with sub - critical matter density .",
    "in this paper , we presented the cluster population that forms within the clef simulation , an @xmath0-body / hydrodynamics simulation of the @xmath1cdm cosmology , with radiative cooling and energy feedback from galaxies .",
    "our cluster sample , with nearly one hundred @xmath2 kev objects at @xmath3 and sixty at @xmath4 , is one of the largest drawn from a single simulation . in this paper",
    ", we studied the demographics of the cluster population out to @xmath4 , focusing on the effects of dynamical activity and the strength of cooling cores , and how the x - ray properties of clusters depend on them .",
    "the sunyaev  zeldovich properties of the clusters may be found in a companion paper ( da silva et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * we quantified the amount of dynamical activity ( major mergers ) within the cluster population , using a simple projected substructure statistic , based on the observable x - ray surface - brightness distribution .",
    "while there is no significant dependence of this quantity , @xmath87 , with cluster temperature , it does increase with redshift .",
    "the fraction of irregular , @xmath86 clusters , shown to be merging systems in the surface - brightness maps , increases from around 10 per cent at @xmath3 to 20 per cent at @xmath4 , thus constituting a minority population at all redshifts . *",
    "the projected icm temperature profile of regular clusters has a generic shape at low and high redshift , decreasing in the centre ( due to radiative cooling ) and beyond @xmath313 , due to the intrinsic shape of the gravitational potential .",
    "irregular clusters have flatter profiles at large radii due to the presence of a second object which compresses and heats the gas .",
    "the shape of the regular cluster profile at @xmath3 is in good agreement with the recent study of cool core clusters by @xcite . * to quantify the core properties of our clusters , we defined two simple ( and observationally - measurable ) structure parameters , @xmath301 , which measures the core to maximum temperature ratio , and @xmath314 which measures the fraction of emission from within the core ( the x - ray concentration of the cluster ) .",
    "we found that the vast majority of clusters contain cool cores ( @xmath110 ) at all redshifts .",
    "this is at odds with the observational data , at least at low redshift , where only half of clusters contain cool cores @xcite .",
    "the x - ray concentration , @xmath114 , is anti - correlated with @xmath109 .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath114 is large at @xmath3 , but decreases with redshift due to the absence of clusters with the highest values ( i.e. the strongest cooling cores ) . *",
    "the scaled entropy profile has an outer logarithmic slope of 0.9 and decreases all the way into the centre , with no evidence of a flattened core .",
    "the ratio of the normalisation at large radii , for clusters at @xmath4 and @xmath3 , is similar to that expected from the gravitational - heating model ( @xmath315 ) , but the @xmath4 clusters have higher central entropy than at @xmath3 .",
    "irregular clusters have higher entropy profiles and regular clusters with strong cooling cores have lower entropy profiles .",
    "the profile at @xmath3 ( in particular for the strong cooling core clusters ) is in good agreement with the recent observational data of @xcite . * mass estimates of x - ray clusters , based on the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , are around 20 per cent lower than the true masses , even when spatial density and temperature information of the icm is known .",
    "as found by @xcite , the reasons for the discrepancy are x - ray temperature bias to low entropy gas and incomplete thermalisation of the gas . * the estimated mass versus",
    "spectroscopic - like temperature relation at @xmath3 is only @xmath316 per cent higher than the observed relation for @xmath45 .",
    "splitting the regular cluster sample into those with weak and strong cooling cores makes little difference to the properties of the relation , when the temperature is measured outside the core .",
    "thus , details of the mass  temperature relation should be insensitive to the cluster selection procedure .",
    "* the mass  temperature relation evolves similarly to the gravitational - heating model prediction , @xmath317 .",
    "the scatter , @xmath318 , evolves very little with redshift . *",
    "the luminosity  temperature relation has a large degree of scatter at @xmath3 , reflecting the large dispersion in x - ray concentration of the clusters .",
    "excising the core emission reduces the scatter considerably , although leads this to a relation that still has a higher normalisation than observed .",
    "irregular clusters are not systematically offset from the main relation .",
    "the luminosity  temperature relation evolves negatively with redshift , contrary to the gravitational - heating expectation , where @xmath319 .",
    "excising the core reduces this negative evolution , with almost self - similar evolution at very low redshift . *",
    "the scatter in the luminosity  temperature relation decreases strongly with redshift , again due to the lack of strong cooling core clusters at high redshift .",
    "there is a positive correlation between the x - ray concentration of the cluster and the redshift when it last had a major merger , but apparently not between the x - ray concentration and the level of feedback experienced by the cluster .",
    "thus , our results indicate that the formation of a _ cooling - flow _ population of clusters at low redshift is tied to the slow down in dynamical activity in the @xmath1cdm model , allowing clusters in quieter environments to develop a strong cooling core .",
    "our simulation is one of the first of a new generation that is able to follow a substantial number of objects with reasonable resolution , while attempting to include the vital physical processes that alter the gravitationally - heated structure of the icm : radiative cooling , star formation and feedback .",
    "while our particular model can reproduce many observed characteristic features of the cluster population , particularly those with cool cores , we acknowledge that it has its shortcomings .",
    "for example , it fails to completely quench the overcooling of baryons into stars , it does not predict enough clusters with warm cores , and it does not match the @xmath138 normalisation in detail ( being too high ) .",
    "all these problems point to the need for an even more efficient heating mechanism that reduces further the amount of cool gas in the clusters , without destroying the already good agreement in cool core clusters",
    ". it may be possible that the problems could be overcome by fine tuning the two feedback model parameters .",
    "however , it is desirable to incorporate a more realistic physical model for feedback , that is able to treat separately the effects from stars and black holes ( in our current model , the heating rate directly follows the star - formation rate )",
    ". the wealth of high - quality x - ray data that is becoming available will undoubtedly help constrain the feedback physics further , and thus allow more realistic cluster models to be constructed .",

    "<S> this is at odds with the observations and so suggests there is still a heating mechanism missing from the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of irregular ( major merger ) systems , based on an observable measure of substructure within x - ray surface - brightness maps , increases with redshift , but always constitutes a minority population within the simulation . using a simple , observable measure of the concentration of the icm , which correlates with the apparent mass deposition rate in the cluster core </S>",
    "<S> , we find a large dispersion within regular clusters at low redshift , but this diminishes at higher redshift , where strong _ cooling - flow _ systems are absent in our simulation . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our results predict that the normalisation and scatter of the luminosity  temperature relation should decrease with redshift ; if such behaviour turns out to be a correct representation of x - ray cluster evolution , it will have significant consequences for the number of clusters found at high redshift in x - ray flux - limited surveys .    </S>",
