    "we will briefly describe the key elements of the theory .",
    "let us begin with a case where @xmath0 particles , interacting via zero range potential @xmath3 , are trapped in a time - independent potential @xmath4 .",
    "we would like to get approximation for the ground state of the system . in the castin and dum theory",
    "bosonic field operator @xmath5 is decomposed into an operator @xmath6 that annihilates a particle in a condensate mode @xmath7 and an annihilation operator @xmath8 defined in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath7 , ( r)=_0(r)a_0+(r ) .",

    "castin and dum have collected operators @xmath8 and @xmath6 in such a way that the effective hamiltonian , h_eff = e_0(n)+12 ^3r ( ^,- ) (    c + ^    ) , [ heff ] depends only on operators ( r)=(r ) . to get ( [ heff ] ) ,",
    "sometimes it was necessary to introduce by hand the operator @xmath10 , i.e. a quantity of the order of one , see ( [ a0 ] ) .",

    "it is not difficult to show that if |_m^r= (    c u_m + v_m    ) , is a right eigenvector of @xmath12 corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath13 , the left eigenvector is |_m^l=_z |_m^r , and _",

    "having a condensate in the ground state of the trapping potential @xmath4 ( i.e. in the bogoliubov vacuum state @xmath24 ) we may apply a time - dependent perturbation .",

    "one can solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations in the standard form and at the end apply the operator @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "however , for large @xmath0 corrections to bosonic commutation relations are small [ see ( [ comb ] ) ] and at the present order of approximation we may consider @xmath30 as bosonic operators that allows us to define ( within a subspace of a fixed @xmath0 ) a fock space ( [ focksp ] ) .",
    "let us now show that solution of ( [ zeq ] ) can be significantly simplified thanks to properties of the bogoliubov modes @xcite . to this end",
