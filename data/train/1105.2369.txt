    "whether the electronic and structural correlations develop concomitant and continuously or discontinuously has to be further evaluated . here",
    "raman scattering data can give decisive information as not only symmetry information but also electronic polarizabilities of the respective states are probed .",
    "raman scattering is a fast technique that may also detect local distortions as it relies on an optically induced virtual electron - hole pair .",
    "there also exists the chance to observe collective orbital excitations",
    ". however , here much less experimental knowledge exists .",
    "an important observation is the nonexistence of sudden changes of the raman phonon spectra between 295 k and 250 k , see fig .",
    "this means that the coherent part of lattice distortions develops only at lower temperatures .",
    "in contrast , the quasielastic scattering , a probe of fluctuations with similar evolution as the specific heat , discontinuously sets in for @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore conclude an extended orbital fluctuation regime from @xmath5 down to approximately @xmath81 k. for @xmath82 the phonon modes show a gradual increase of intensity and a rapid increase below approximately 110 k. below also 110 k distinct phonon splittings show up and the quasielastic scattering is suppressed .",
    "therefore @xmath6 marks a crossover with a suppression of orbital fluctuations and an onset of long range structural distortions .",
    "the observed dynamics is different from quasi - one - dimensional correlated electronic systems like bavs@xmath0 @xcite or weakly doped manganites where persisting orbital fluctuations are attributed to an entangled instability of the orbital , electronic , and lattice subsystems @xcite .",
    "since sr@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 has no electronic instability or low dimensionality , the origin of the fluctuations should be sought in the relation between the orbital ordering and the structural instability . introducing a ratio of the jahn - teller gap versus the structural phase transition temperature ,",
    "@xmath83  1.6 , shows that thermal fluctuations even well below @xmath5 can smear out the jahn - teller gap and thus destabilize orbital ordering .",
    "we carefully inspected whether collective orbital excitations ( orbitons ) show up in the frequency range of @xmath84 270  330 @xmath51 . at room temperature",
    "we observe a highly - damped peak in the respective energy interval ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . with lowering temperature",
    "two modes develop at about 300 and 330 @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast to other sharp peaks at 3 k , the mode at 300 @xmath51 ( @xmath85 k ) is relatively broad .",
    "this indicates the possibility that the corresponding mode is an orbital excitation mixed with a phonon .",
    "a similar observation was reported for the vanadates @xmath13vo@xmath0 , where orbital excitations couple to the jahn - teller phonon @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology is different from observations in the three dimensional perovskites latio@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 as in these compounds the energy scale of the orbitons ( 2700 k ) is clearly separated from the phonon system @xcite .",
    "further evidence for mixing of phonon and orbital degrees of freedom is gained from the temperature dependence of the 71 @xmath51 phonon mode , in energy , linewidth and lineshape . actually , this dependence shares similarities with a crystalline electric field transition in the rare earth compound pr@xmath1cuo@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , in a @xmath7 electron system such modes should be broadened by dispersion . in band structure calculations",
    "@xcite for sr@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 the respective energy scale is of the order of 300 mev , i.e. also one order larger than @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the origin of the 71 @xmath51 mode is very likely a mixed phonon - orbiton mode .",
    "next , we will focus on the magnetic excitations in sr@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 . as reported",
    "previously @xcite , these excitations form a gapped magnon with a gap size of @xmath86 @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "4 a ) , two magnetic modes are observed at low , but finite temperatures .",
    "the high energy magnetic mode at 90 @xmath51 is observed in all measured polarizations , i.e. ( @xmath54 ) , ( @xmath47 ) , ( @xmath49 ) and ( @xmath50 ) , but has its strongest contribution in ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath54 ) polarization , i.e. the polarization along the dimer direction , while its intensity is weakest in crossed , i.e. ( @xmath50 ) polarization .",
    "since the magnetic raman scattering intensity is given by @xmath87 , it scales in each polarization with the strength of exchange interactions between dimers . in this sense ,",
    "the presence of the substantial spectral weight in the ( @xmath49 ) polarization implies moderate interdimer interactions in the @xmath88 plane .",
    "the onset energy of the magnetic excitations is roughly 56 @xmath51 , which corresponds to 7 mev or 81 k , and is therefore twice the size of the spin gap .",
    "the high energy cut - off at 118 @xmath51 corresponds to 14.75 mev . as the triplet branch of excitations observed in inelastic neutron spectroscopy reaches up to 7.2 mev",
    ", we attribute this mode to two - magnon scattering , i.e. a scattering process involving the simultaneous spin flip of two neighboring spins , hence costing twice the magnetic exchange energy .",
    "the intensity of the two - magnon mode is plotted over temperature in fig . 4 d ) ( green triangles ) .",
    "it continuously decreases in intensity as the temperature is increased and fully depletes below 100 k. this is associated with a thermal population of the singlet ground state into an excited triplet state .",
    "the intensity of the mode at 45 @xmath51 , on the other hand , shows a clear maximum at around 30 k before steadily decreasing towards @xmath89 k. therefore , we can rule out one - magnon scattering , which would show a monotonous increase in intensity down to lowest temperature . instead , a three - magnon scattering process might account for this observed mode @xcite .",
    "three - magnon scattering can occur through a transition from one singlet and one excited triplet state to two neighboring triplet states , i.e. @xmath90 .",
    "therefore it can only arise in the environment of thermally excited triplet states at finite temperatures .",
    "such a thermal population is described by the bose - einstein statistics of the excited level .",
    "our data is in good agreement with theory , as the fit to the integrated intensity at low temperatures in fig .",
    "4 d ) shows .",
    "upon additional temperature increase , one furthermore increases the population of triplets , which eventually leads to saturation .",
    "this causes the intensity of the three - magnon mode to drop again towards high temperatures .",
    "the onset of the mode is at roughly 30 @xmath51 . as a three - magnon process corresponds to a transition from the triplet branch at the @xmath91-point of the brillouin zone to the two - magnon band",
    ", the onset energy can be estimated by @xmath92 @xmath51 which fits well to the observed value .",
    "the cut - off energy would therefore be expected around @xmath93 @xmath51 .",
    "however , it can only unambiguously be traced up to 56 @xmath51 , i.e. the onset of the two - magnon signal . above this energy the two modes overlap , therefore a clear determination of the cut - off energy is rather difficult .    remarkably , such a three - magnon scattering has also been reported in the weakly coupled spin dimer compound kcucl@xmath0 with a spin gap of @xmath94 k @xcite and in the spin - peierls system cugeo@xmath0 with @xmath95 k @xcite .",
    "all three compounds show a maximum in intensity around the spin gap temperature .",
    "however , for kcucl@xmath0 the three - magnon signal is observed up to @xmath96 , while for sr@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 it is obscured by the lattice fluctuations even at @xmath97 .",
    "all three systems show an instability in large magnetic fields .",
    "for kcucl@xmath0 and sr@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 this is a bose - einstein condensation of diluted magnons , while cugeo@xmath0 becomes an incommensurate antiferromagnet .",
    "the common observation of three - magnon raman scattering and a field - induced transition is due to enhanced hopping , i.e. , a not too large gap .",
    "in conclusion , our raman data reveals an extended temperature regime in which orbital fluctuations dominate the lattice dynamics of sr@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the energy scale of the orbital ordering , driven by a jahn - teller distortion , is estimated to be @xmath98 k in good agreement with esr .",
    "this energy is also comparable to typical phonon frequencies of the tetrahedral cr - o coordinations and thermal energies for @xmath99 k. this promotes an intricate interplay between orbital - lattice and spin - orbital coupled quantities .",
