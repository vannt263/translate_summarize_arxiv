    "the phase transitions of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fully - frustrated @xmath0 ( ff@xmath0 ) model on a square lattice has been a subject of controversy .",
    "@xcite the emerging consensus is that the model , as the temperature is lowered , first undergoes an ising - like transition associated with the chirality . at a slightly lower temperature it undergoes a universal jump kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition associated with the phase angles .",
    "@xcite since the two transitions are extremely close to each other in temperature the question whether there is only one merged transition or actually two separate transitions has been the cause of the controversy .",
    "an argument for two separate transitions with the kt transition always at a lower temperature than the chirality transition was given by korshunov in ref .",
    "in terms of a kink - antikink instability of the domain walls separating domains with different chirality . the 2d generalized fully frustrated @xmath0(gff@xmath0 ) model has the same degrees of freedom and the same symmetries as the ff@xmath0 model .",
    "the argument by korshunov  @xcite is quite general and appears to hinge only on the combined @xmath5 and @xmath6 symmetry of the model and the existence of ising - like domain walls associated with the broken @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "@xcite this strongly suggests that also the generalized model with the very same degrees of freedom and symmetry should always have a kt transition at a lower temperature than the chirality transition . _ as shown here , this is not the case : the two transitions can merge in a single critical point .",
    "_ the reason for this unexpected result is that the symmetry of the model allows for a new phase 2d `` quasi '' phase - order .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : gffxy ] , we introduce the generalized fully - frustrated @xmath0 model . the results of our numerical simulations are presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : mag ] for the staggered magnetization , in sec .",
    "[ sec : helicity ] for the helicity modulus , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : y4 ] for the fourth - order modulus , respectively",
    ". finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary of the paper .",
    "the @xmath0 model on a square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field transversal to the lattice plane is described by the action : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the phase variable at the @xmath9th site , the sum is over nearest neighbors , @xmath10 is the coupling constant , @xmath11 is the temperature , @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath13 is the line integral along the bond between adjacent sites @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the case where the bond variables @xmath15 are fixed , uniformly quenched , out of equilibrium with the site variables and satisfy the condition @xmath16 : here the sum is over each set of bonds of an elementary plaquette and @xmath17 is the strength of frustration .",
    "we assume that the local magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is equal to the uniform applied field ; such an approximation is more valid the smaller is the sample size @xmath2 compared with the transverse penetration depth @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite in the case of full frustration , i.e. , @xmath19 , of interest to us here , such a model has a continuous @xmath5 symmetry associated with the rotation of spins and an extra discrete @xmath6 symmetry , as it has been shown by analyzing the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "@xcite choosing the landau gauge , such that vector potential vanishes on all horizontal bonds and on alternating vertical bounds , we get a lattice where each plaquette displays one antiferromagnetic and three ferromagnetic bonds .",
    "such a choice corresponds to switching the sign of the interaction .",
    "the generalized ff@xmath0 model is obtained by changing the form of the interaction from @xmath20 to  @xcite @xmath21 .\\]]this does not alter any symmetry present in the original ff@xmath0 model which corresponds to @xmath22 since @xmath23=1-\\cos \\phi $ ] .",
    "the essential point is that @xmath24 is periodic in @xmath25 and that the first term in an expansion for small @xmath26 is second order , i.e. , @xmath27 for @xmath28 .     model .",
    "the phases are characterized by the helicity modulus @xmath1 and the staggered magnetization @xmath29 .",
    "the four phases correspond to all possible combinations of finite and vanishing @xmath1 and @xmath29 .",

    "the helicity modulus @xmath1 , which relates to the continuous angular symmetry , and the staggered magnetizations @xmath29 , which relates to the discrete chirality symmetry , are used to detect phase boundaries .",
    "the phase diagram contains all four possible combinations of these two , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "the dashed horizontal line at @xmath22 corresponds to the usual ff@xmath0 model , for which the phase @xmath32 is not realized .",
    "we first present numerical mc results of the staggered magnetization @xmath29 , defined as  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ensemble average and the vorticity for the @xmath35th elementary plaquette at @xmath36 is computed from @xmath37 with the sum taken in the anti - clockwise around the given plaquette .",
    "the ground states with the spontaneously broken chirality symmetry correspond to the two possible checker board patterns with alternating positive and negative vorticity .",
    "the energy per link in these ground states is given by @xmath38 which corresponds to all links contributing the same energy .",
    "since the two ground states with different checker board patterns are separated by an infinite energy barrier in the thermodynamic limit , the phase with the broken chirality symmetry persists at low enough temperatures as long as the pattern , where all links contribute the same energy , indeed corresponds to the ground state .",
    "however , this ceases to be true when @xmath39 becomes larger than @xmath40 . in this new region",
    "the ground state instead corresponds to a pattern consisting of plaquettes with phase difference @xmath41 on three sides and @xmath42 on the remaining .",
    "the energy per link is hence instead @xmath43 . the critical value @xmath40 is easily computed to be @xmath44 from the condition that @xmath45 .",

    "is characterized by the universal jump in the helicity modulus , @xmath73 .",

    "@xcite here we use the following method : the values of the @xmath64 at the crossing point with the line @xmath74 are determined as a function of size @xmath2 .",
    "these values are well approximated by a second order polynomial as shown in fig .",

    "the determination of the kt - line rests on the assumption that the kt - jump has the universal value @xmath81 .",
    "a jump means that the crossing point between the @xmath82 and @xmath83 should give the same @xmath84 for all @xmath85 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hel](c ) shows the difference @xmath86 for @xmath58 .",
    "our result is consistent with a universal jump kt transition , since @xmath87 is consistent with a vanishing for @xmath76 . on the other hand",
    "the jumps size is inconsistent with a double jump since @xmath88 approaches a finite value . for larger values of @xmath46 , like @xmath67 ,",

    "conversely , a continuous kt transition with a nonuniversal jump can neither be ruled out .",
    "however , when @xmath39 is increased further the transition does eventually become first order as can be detected from the double well structure in the energy histogram .",
    "for the first order transition the jump should be nonuniversal and larger than the universal jump .",

    "this is consistent with the result we find for @xmath39-values below the horizontal line in the phase diagram . in this part of the phase diagram the argument by korshunov",
    "@xcite is valid and the chirality transition and the kt transitions are separated with the kt transition always at a lower temperature . on the other hand , when the horizontal phase line meets and crosses the kt line , korshunov s argument  @xcite is no longer valid and one expects a merged character of the transition .",
    "the argument by korshunov fails because it presumes the existence of ising - like domain walls and such walls do not exist above the horizontal line . in order to monitor the change of character of the transition we study the fourth - order helicity modulus ,  @xcite defined by the expansion of the free energy @xmath91 .",
    "the observation that @xmath90 is finite and negative precisely at the kt transition  @xcite leads to the conclusion that @xmath1 makes an abrupt jump at @xmath64 in order to fulfill the requirement of @xmath92 at any @xmath11 .",
