    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , which is characterized by an adiabatic change of the temperature ( or by an isothermal change of the entropy ) under the variation of the applied magnetic field , has a long history in cooling applications at various temperature regimes  @xcite . since the first successful experiment of the adiabatic demagnetization performed in 1933  @xcite , the mce is a standard technique for achieving the extremely low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction and description of materials with an enhanced or even giant mce create real opportunities for the effective selection of the construction for working magnetic refrigeration devices . of particular interest",
    "is the investigation of the mce in various one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin systems  @xcite or hybrid spin - electron models  @xcite .",
    "the reason is a possibility of obtaining the exact analytical or numerical results as well as a potential use of these models for the explanation of mce data measured for real magnetic compounds . in particular",
    ", 1d models may give correct quantitative description of real three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnets , when appropriate rescaling of material parameters are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "in the present letter , we will investigate the mce in a hybrid double - tetrahedral chain composed of the localized ising spins and mobile electrons , which is exactly solvable by combining the generalized decoration - iteration mapping transformation  @xcite and the transfer - matrix technique  @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in our previous works  @xcite , the considered 1d spin - electron system provides a suitable prototype model for theoretical investigation of the relation between the ground - state degeneracy and the cooling efficiency of the system during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we will describe the investigated spin - electron double - tetrahedral chain and then , the basic steps of an exact analytical treatment of the model will briefly be recalled .",
    "exact calculations of the basic thermodynamic quantities , such as the gibbs free energy , the total magnetization , the entropy and the magnetic grneisen parameter , will be realized in this section . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we will particularly discuss the numerical results acquired for the ground state , the entropy and the magnetic grneisen parameter as functions of the applied magnetic field under the assumption of the one - third electron filling of each triangular cluster and the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the mobile electrons and their nearest ising neighbours .",

    "arbitrary but non - zero magnetic field tends to align the ising spins into the field direction and thus , it cancels the macroscopic degeneracy of the fru phase ( and also the associated residual entropy @xmath73 ) .",
    "by contrast , the fm phase remains macroscopically degenererate in the whole parameter region .",
    "now , let us turn to the discussion of the magnetocaloric properties of the investigated model . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we depict isothermal changes of the entropy per one magnetic particle @xmath74 ( recall that the system is composed of @xmath28 ising spins and @xmath75 mobile electrons ) under the field variation assuming the fixed coulomb term @xmath76 , the hopping parameter @xmath77 and various temperatures",
    ". as one can see from this figure , the entropy isotherms monotonously decrease from its maximum at @xmath78 upon the increasing magnetic field down to temperature @xmath79 . below @xmath79 , the entropy exhibits non - monotonous dependencies as a function of the external magnetic field with a pronounced peak at the critical field  ( [ eq : h_c ] ) , at which the system undergoes a phase transition between the fru and fm phases .",
    "finally , the continuous entropy isotherms split    into the isolated points with the coordinates @xmath80=[0 , \\ln 2^{1/3}]$ ] , @xmath80=[h_c/|j| , \\ln 3^{1/3}]$ ] and the lines @xmath81",
    "( @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) when the temperature reaches the zero value .",
    "in general , the residual entropy found in the frustrated magnetic systems and at critical points corresponding to the phase transitions between different magnetic structures gives a rise to an enhanced mce accompanied by a relatively fast cooling of systems during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization . to investigate the efficiency of the adiabatic cooling of the considered spin - electron system in these regions , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the magnetic grneisen parameter multiplied by the temperature @xmath85 versus the external magnetic field for the relatively low temperature @xmath86 and a few values of the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath52 . evidently , the low - temperature @xmath85 curves depicted in this figure exhibit two local maxima at very low ( but non - zero ) magnetic field and slightly above the critical field  ( [ eq : h_c ] ) of the zero - temperature phase transition fru  fm in addition to the one local minimum slightly below  ( [ eq : h_c ] ) .",
    "the sign change of the @xmath85 product observed close to the critical field  ( [ eq : h_c ] ) clearly indicates a rapid accumulation of the entropy due to a mutual competition between the neighbouring ground - state configurations ( see e.g.  the curves plotted for @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and for @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b and compare them with the corresponding isothermal dependence of @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the peaks appearing around the field - induced phase transition     +    fru  fm are much higher than those observed at relatively small magnetic fields . for example , for @xmath77 and @xmath89 we have @xmath90 at @xmath91 and @xmath92 at @xmath93 ( see fig .  [ fig4]b ) .",
    "it is thus clear that the cooling capability of the system during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization is substantially higher ( approximately three times ) just above the critical field , where strong thermal excitations of the mobile electrons are present at relatively low temperatures due to breaking up the quantum superpositions of their up - down states , than that one at relatively small magnetic fields , where the zeeman s splitting of energy levels of the frustrated ising spins takes place . except to this behaviour , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] also illustrates the effect of the hopping parameter and the on - site coulomb repulsion on the enhancement of the mce in the investigated model .",

    "[ fig4]a ) , while it decreases in these regions with increasing the coulomb parameter @xmath52 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig4]b ) .    to discuss the mce in the considered spin - electron double - tetrahedral chain",
    ", we may alternatively investigate an adiabatic change of temperature of the model under the magnetic field variation .",
    "for this purpose , we present a density plot of the entropy as a function of the magnetic field and temperature for the fixed coulomb term @xmath76 and the hopping parameter @xmath77 in fig .",
    "isentropic changes of temperature upon varying the magnetic field can be identified in this figure as contours of the constant entropy displayed by solid and broken lines . in accordance with the previous discussion , the enhanced mce during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization can be found just above the zero field as well as nearby the critical field corresponding to the field - induced phase transition between the fru and fm phases .",
    "the most abrupt drop in temperature up to the zero value is achieved under the adiabatic condition in these regions if the entropy of the system    is set sufficiently close to the values @xmath72 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the present letter deals with the ground - state and magnetocaloric properties of the double - tetrahedral chain , where the nodal lattice sites occupied by the localized ising spins regularly alternate with three equivalent lattice sites available for two mobile electrons . based on the exact solution of the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have analytically derived exact results for the basic thermodynamic quantities , such as the gibbs free energy , the total magnetization , the entropy and the magnetic grneisen parameter of the system . by considering the ferromagnetic exchange interaction ( @xmath49 ) between the mobile electrons and their nearest ising neighbours , we have found two macroscopically degenerate ground states ( fru and fm ) , which can also be found in the antiferromagnetic counterpart of the model  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the macroscopic degeneracy of the fru phase arising due to the kinetically - driven frustration of the localized ising spins as well as the macroscopic degeneracy of the system at the field - induced phase transition between the fru and fm phases perfectly manifest themselves in the enhanced mce during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization .",
    "it has been evidenced that the cooling capability of the system during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization is approximately three times higher nearby the phase transition fru ",
    "fm , where strong thermal excitations of the mobile electrons are present at relatively low temperatures due to breaking up the quantum superpositions of their up - down states , than that one at relatively small magnetic fields , where the zeeman s splitting of energy levels of the frustrated ising spins takes place .",
