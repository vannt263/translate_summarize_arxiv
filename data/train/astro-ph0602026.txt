    "in hierarchical galaxy formation models , cosmic structures form by the gravitational amplification of small primordial fluctuations of matter density in the early universe @xcite . studies of the clustering properties of galaxies at high redshift are essential for understanding galaxy and structure formation .",
    "one of the most commonly used statistics to measure the clustering of a population of sources is the two - point correlation function @xmath9 , which measures the excess probability of finding a pair of objects at a separation @xmath10 with respect to a random distribution .",
    "high redshift radio galaxies are ideal targets for pinpointing massive systems .",
    "radio galaxies follow a close relation in the hubble @xmath11 diagram @xcite .",
    "the nature of this behavior in the @xmath11 diagram shows that the stellar luminosities of @xmath12 radio galaxies are more luminous than normal galaxies at these redshifts @xcite . at lower redshifts",
    "they are found frequently in moderately rich clusters @xcite recently , galaxy overdensities comparable to that expected for clusters of abell class 0 richness are found near radio galaxies up to @xmath13 @xcite.there is increasing evidence that galaxy overdensities around radio galaxies existed at very high redshifts . using ly@xmath14 and/or h@xmath14 techniques , @xcite found overdensities of companion galaxies around powerful @xmath15 radio galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we estimated the spatial correlation length for galaxies in the fields of uss targets selected from the 843 mhz sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) and 1.4 ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) in the redshift range @xmath16 , through the limber s equation using an appropriate observed redshift distribution .",
    "we compared our results with those obtained in cosmological n ",
    "body simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the sample analyzed , we investigate the uss - galaxy cross - correlation analysis in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we interpret our results with those obtained in a cosmological n  body simulation .",
    "finally we discuss our results in section 5 .    throughout this paper",

    "the uss sample selection , radio data and redshifts used for this analysis was presented and described by @xcite .",
    "detailed descriptions of the construction of the galaxy catalogue is given in @xcite .",
    "in summary , we used 11 @xmath22band images centered in ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) radio sources selected from the sydney university molonglo sky survey and nrao vla sky survey , obtained with the instrument iris2 at the aat telescope .",
    "we selected the redshift of the uss sample in the range @xmath0 .",
    "the redshift upper limit was adopted in order to assure that @xmath23band images are sufficiently deep while the lower limit precludes the use of too close uss for which the field of view subtends too small linear scales .",

    "the spatial two - point cross - correlation function @xmath25 has been shown to be well approximated by a power law :    @xmath30    in order to obtain the cross  correlation length @xmath31 we first determine the projected cross - correlation function @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the projected separation between a uss target and a galaxy at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "we use the following estimator of the projected cross - correlation function , @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the numbers of galaxies in the sample and in a random sample respectively , @xmath38 is the number of real uss - galaxy pairs separated by a projected distance in the range @xmath33 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the corresponding pairs when considering the random galaxy sample .",
    "we estimate the corresponding correlation length using the limber equation @xcite . the power law model for @xmath25",

    "equation [ lil ] can be easily solved analytically if we perform a linear interpolation of @xmath47 between its values at the measured @xmath48 s . in order to calculate the constant @xmath42 we evaluated the selection function @xmath44 using the redshift ( spectroscopic and photometric ) distribution of @xmath2 galaxies published by @xcite .",
    "we model the distance distribution using a gaussian function , and find that @xmath49 @xmath5 mpc ( mean ) and @xmath50 @xmath5 mpc ( standard deviation ) is a reasonable set of values that reproduces the distribution ( see figure  [ distri ] ) . in figure [ pro ] we show the projected cross - correlation function @xmath51 for uss targets with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath52 and galaxies with @xmath53 .",
    "we estimate cross - correlation function error bars using the @xmath54 technique @xcite .",
    "we find a comoving correlation length @xmath55 @xmath5 mpc with slope @xmath560.04 .",
    "we tested the accuracy of this result by varying the @xmath44 distribution over a reasonable range of values for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the number of galform galaxies ranges from @xmath72 to @xmath73 at @xmath69 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "we now briefly explain the procedure by which galaxies are assigned their properties in the semi - analytic code .",
    "galform is run for each halo in the numerical simulation , where galaxies are assigned to a randomly selected dark matter halo particle .",
    "the different galaxy properties such as magnitudes in different bands , including the @xmath23band , depend on the dark matter halo merger tree .",
    "this merger tree is generated via monte - carlo modelling based on the extended press - schechter theory , and the evolution of the galaxy population in the halo is followed through time and different processes are considered in this evolution , including gas cooling , quiescent star formation and star formation bursts , mergers , galactic winds and super winds , metal enrichment , extinction by dust . for full details on the modelling the reader is referred to @xcite .",

    "correlation function using the simulation haloes with masses above a lower mass limit as centres , and as tracers , the galform semi - analytic galaxies . by comparing these measurements to the results from the cross ",
    "correlation between uss and normal galaxies , we make the implicit assumption that uss galaxies reside at the centres of dark - matter haloes",
    ". this comparison will make it possible to infer the mass of the structures associated to the uss hosts .",

    "this test provides a useful check of our observational results which were derived from relatively small projected scales ( @xmath771 mpc ) .",
