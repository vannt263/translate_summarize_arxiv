    "the late cosmic acceleration , discovered by the type ia supernovae ( snia ) observations @xcite , is the most intriguing feature of the universe .",

    "the natural and most simple model is the cosmological constant , @xmath1 , associated to the vacuum energy , and whose equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath2 , is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "there are several cosmological observations beyond snia data , such as the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , supporting the cosmological constant as the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are theoretical problems associated to the cosmological constant : the fine - tuning problem , i.e. , its value is @xmath4120 orders of magnitude below the quantum field theory prediction and the coincidence problem , that is , why the de density is similar to that of dark matter ( dm ) today @xcite .    a straightforward way to solve these problems",
    "is by considering models where the eos evolves with time . among the most studied dynamical de models are those involving scalar fields , for instance ,",
    "quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , and k - essence fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are many models in which the de eos is parameterized in terms of the scale factor or redshift @xcite , for instance , the well - known chevallier - polarski - linder ansatz ( cpl , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility of interactions between the dm and de are also considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "these coupled models could alleviate both the coincidence problem and the tension among different cosmological data @xcite .",
    "other interesting scenarios that have gained interest are the holographic dark energy ( hde ) models which are proposed in the context of a fundamental principle of quantum gravity , so called the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "although some hde models could alleviate the coincidence problem and are in agreement with the cosmological data , they face many issues that must be solved @xcite .",
    "thus , there are plenty of models with different theoretical motivations , which are in agreement with some set of observational data and explain the accelerated expansion in the universe @xcite . to discriminate among all these scenarios it is common to put constraints on their parameters using the distance modulus from snia , the cmb anisotropies , and bao @xcite .",
    "many of the current data analysis are performed assuming a fiducial @xmath1 cold dm model .",
    "therefore , to improve the cosmological parameter estimation and to avoid biased constraints due to the assumption of a model , it is necessary to acquire high - precision data and to develop new complementary cosmological techniques , such as cosmography , which studies a set of observables of the universe s kinematics ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "in these previous works , the alternative cosmological models are tested by comparing ( for the lens systems ) the theoretical ratio of the angular diameter distances with an observable .",

    "recently @xcite investigated a novel non - parametric sl lens modelling to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "they applied this procedure using synthetic lenses and showed that it is possible to infer unbiased constraints from the assumed cosmological parameters .",

    "<S> in this paper we constrain four alternative models to the late cosmic acceleration in the universe : chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) , interacting dark energy ( ide ) , ricci holographic dark energy ( hde ) , and modified polytropic cardassian ( mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> strong lensing ( sl ) images of background galaxies produced by the galaxy cluster abell @xmath0 are used to test these models . to perform this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we modify the lenstool lens modeling code . </S>",
    "<S> the value added by this probe is compared with other complementary probes : type ia supernovae ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the cpl constraints obtained of the sl data are consistent with those estimated using the other probes . </S>",
    "<S> the ide constraints are consistent with the complementary bounds only if large errors in the sl measurements are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the ricci hde and mpc constraints are weak but they are similar to the bao , snia and cmb estimations . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the figure - of - merit as a tool to quantify the goodness of fit of the data . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the sl method provides statistically significant constraints on the cpl parameters but weak for those of the other models . finally , we show that the use of the sl measurements in galaxy clusters is a promising and powerful technique to constrain cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this method is that cosmological parameters are estimated by modelling the sl features for each underlying cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> these estimations could be further improved by sl constraints coming from other galaxy clusters . </S>"
