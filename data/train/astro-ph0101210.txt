    "the stable clustering hypothesis is a basic assumption in cosmology about the nonlinear clustering of cosmic matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "it states that the mean physical separations @xmath5 of particles in highly non - linear regions do not change with the expansion of the universe . in terms of the scale factor @xmath6 and",
    "the comoving coordinates @xmath7 , the hypothesis equivalently states that the relative pair velocity in the comoving coordinates @xmath8 cancels out the hubble flow @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 based on this assumption plus self - similarity , it is predicted that 1 ) the power - law index of the two - point correlation function @xmath11 on sufficiently small scales is related to the power - law index @xmath12 of the linear power spectrum @xmath13 as @xmath14 , and 2 ) the n - point correlation functions @xmath15 scale with @xmath16 as @xmath17 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the first prediction for clustering on small scale and the linear theory prediction for large scale , a phenomenological fitting formula has been found for the nonlinear power spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this fitting formula has been applied to study a wide range of non - linear clustering problems , notably the gravitational lensing and the non - linear clustering of galaxies .",
    "there have been many attempts to verify the stable clustering hypothesis with numerical n - body simulations . in their seminal work ,",
    "efstathiou et al .",
    "( @xcite ) tested the hypothesis [ eq.([eq1 ] ) ] and its two predictions with a set of scale - free n - body simulations of @xmath18 particles .",
    "they concluded that their simulation results are consistent with the hypothesis , but it is not difficult to imagine that the accuracy they could achieve is quite limited for the limited resolution of this first generation of simulations .",
    "subsequently , many improved simulations with @xmath19 to @xmath20 particles have been used to solve this problem ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and references therein ) . as shown by jain ( 1997 ; his fig.2 , fig.3 and fig.8 ) , his simulation results of the mean pair velocity have just approached the stable clustering condition [ eq.([eq1 ] ) ] at the smallest scale that his simulations of @xmath21 particles can resolve .",
    "thus , it remains an open question if the stable clustering holds for a range of scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "one point clear from these previous studies is that only in high overdensity regions @xmath22 is the stable clustering assumption possibly valid .",
    "one needs simulations which have much higher resolutions than those jain analyzed , in order to convincingly test the stable clustering .",
    "it is well known that close pairs of particles reside inside virialized halos ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason why many people have recently constructed successful models for non - linear statistics based on the simulation result of the halo density profile and the halo mass function ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , ma & fry 2000a , b , c , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , ma & fry ( 2000b ) checked the stable clustering assumption using such an approach .",
    "they derived the mean pair velocity by inserting the halo model two - point correlation function into the pair conservation equation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and found that the stable clustering is valid only when the halo mass function and the halo density profile obey specific relations .",
    "considering the fact that both models of the halo density profile and the halo mass function have considerable uncertainties and scatters ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , they concluded that it is yet unclear if the stable clustering can be realized in practice .    in this",
    "_ letter _ , we propose to use high - resolution halo simulations to test the stable clustering hypothesis by examining the mean pair velocity within virialized halos .",
    "the validity of this approach underlies the above - mentioned fact that almost all close pairs of galaxies reside inside virialized halos .",
    "if the mean pair velocity within halos agrees with the stable clustering hypothesis , one can sufficiently conclude that the stable clustering is established , since the mean pair velocity in general is a @xmath23 weighted average of the mean pair velocity within halos , where @xmath24 is the mean pair number of separation @xmath5 inside a halo of mass @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the halo number density per unit halo mass .",
    "the advantage of this approach over the conventional approach which uses cosmological n - body simulations ( e.g. jain 1997 ) is that the individual halos can be simulated with a much better resolution .",
    "here we use fourteen high - resolution halos to make such an analysis .",
    "twelve of these halos were used for studying density profiles of dark matter halos ( jing & suto 2000 ) and the other two were simulated after the work of jing & suto ( 2000 ) .",
    "fourteen dark matter halos in total were selected from our one cosmological p@xmath27 m n - body simulation of @xmath28 particles in a @xmath29 cube ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the model for this simulation",
    "is the standard lambda cold dark matter model which has the density parameter @xmath30 , the cosmological constant @xmath31 , the hubble constant @xmath32 and the power spectrum normalization @xmath33 .",
    "these model parameters are consistent with the current observations of the cluster abundance , of the cosmic background radiation anisotropies , of high - redshift supernova luminosity , and of many others . of the fourteen halos , five , five , and four have mass scales of clusters , groups and galaxies respectively .",
    "these halos are re - simulated with high resolution using the multiple mass method ( e.g. @xcite ) and our nested - grid @xmath34 code ( @xcite ) . to minimize the contamination of the coarse particles on the halo properties within the virial radius at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , we trace back the particles within @xmath37 of each halo to their initial conditions at redshift @xmath38 .",
    "the virial radius @xmath39 is defined such that the spherical overdensity inside is @xmath40 times the critical density @xmath41 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "typically @xmath42 fine particles are placed in the high resolution region , and @xmath43 coarse particles , whose mass increases monotonically with the distance from the high - resolution region , are placed outside the high resolution region to model the tidal force effect .",
    "the initial conditions for these particles are produced with the same random initial field as the cosmological n - body simulation but with the shorter wavelength perturbations added that the cosmological n - body simulation missed .",
    "the simulations are evolved by our nested - grid @xmath34 code which was designed to simulate high - resolution halos .",
    "the force resolution is typically @xmath44 . at last about @xmath45 particles",
    "end up within @xmath39 of each halo . for more details about the simulation",
    ", we refer readers to jing & suto ( 2000 ) .",
    "we calculate the mean pair velocity @xmath46 by averaging the relative velocity of all pairs of particles within the virial radius .",
    "separation bins are taken from @xmath47 to @xmath48 with @xmath49 . since one halo has @xmath45 particles , there are more than @xmath50 pairs in total in each halo , and more than @xmath51 pairs within the single innermost bin .",
    "the high number of pairs is very crucial for investigating @xmath46 at the smallest separation .",
    "this is because relative to the stable clustering prediction @xmath52 at @xmath53 , the random motion of particles ( i.e. the noise for determining @xmath54 ) is very large which , in terms of the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , is about @xmath55 . in order to suppress the noise , more than @xmath56 particle pairs are needed for the innermost bin .",
    "only high - resolution halo simulations like those used in this paper can easily meet this requirement .",
    "in contrast , cosmological n - body simulations would need many more than @xmath20 particles to study @xmath46 at a similar scale .",
    "we find that the mean pair velocity @xmath46 varies significantly from one halo to another . in figure 1",
    ", we show @xmath57 for the five cluster halos as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the halos are labeled in the same way as jing & suto ( 2000 ) with the newly added halo labeled as cl5 .",
    "although the measured values of @xmath57 are around the stable clustering prediction @xmath58 , there is significant difference in this quantity between one halo and another .",
    "some halo has @xmath59 systematically higher than @xmath58 ( cl3 ) , and some lower than @xmath58 ( cl1 & cl2 ) .",
    "we have examined whether @xmath57 is correlated with the dynamical state and the density profiles of halos . from jing & suto ( 2000 ) , we know that cl1 has the smallest concentration parameter and cl2 has the largest among the first four halos , while they have similar @xmath57 .",
    "therefore there seems to be no apparent correlation between the density profiles and @xmath57 , which is also supported by the results of galaxy and group halos ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the large variation of @xmath57 from halo to halo might reflect the fact that the merging and relaxation processes are still taking place within the halos , which is not unexpected in the hierarchical clustering scenario , and the value of @xmath57 depends on a fine balance of the both processes within a halo .    for testing the stable clustering hypothesis ,",
    "the important quantity is not the @xmath57 of an individual halo , but the averaged value of @xmath57 over halos of a given mass .",
    "figure 2 shows the averaged @xmath57 for the cluster ( cl ) , group ( gr ) and galaxy ( gx ) halos ( note that the vertical axis is different from that of figure 1 ) .",
    "the measurement has a typical uncertainty @xmath60 ( for clarity , the error bars are plotted for the cluster halos only ) .",
    "as the figure shows , the result of each set of halos is consistent with the stable clustering hypothesis within the measurement uncertainty .",
    "similarities have been found for the halos of different mass after the length ( and correspondingly other quantities ) is scaled to the halo size .",
    "navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed a universal density profile for halos , and klypin et al ( 1999 ) and moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the number distributions of subhalos ( after scaling to the circular velocity ) are very similar between galaxy and cluster halos .",
    "although there is some systematic difference between halos of different mass even after scaling ( e.g. the density profiles , jing & suto 2000 ) , the small difference might not be important for the current work .",
    "this is reflected in figure 2 which shows no dependence of @xmath57 on the halo mass . as a further step ,",
    "we average @xmath57 over all 14 halos at each @xmath61-bin , and the results are presented in figure 3 .",
    "it shows that the averaged result is well consistent with the stable clustering prediction within a typical uncertainty @xmath1 .",
    "according to the density profiles , the typical density contrast at @xmath62 is @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "we have made a first attempt to investigate the validity of the stable clustering hypothesis using high - resolution halo simulations .",
    "we have obtained the following conclusions .    *",
    "the mean pair velocity within a single halo fluctuates strongly around the stable clustering prediction .",
    "this may indicate that the merging and relaxation processes inside halos have not fully completed , as should be expected for hierarchical clustering scenarios . *",
    "the mean pair velocity averaged over four or five halos of a similar mass is consistent with the stable clustering prediction with an uncertainty of @xmath63 .",
    "no dependence on halo mass has been seen for the quantity @xmath57 . *",
    "based on the similarities exhibited by halos of different mass , we averaged the @xmath57 over the fourteen halos at each @xmath61-bin .",
    "the result is in very good agreement with the stable clustering assumption with an uncertainty of @xmath1 over a large range of the scales @xmath5 , thus lending strong support for the stable clustering hypothesis .",
    "it is important to emphasize again that the stable clustering condition ( 1 ) is not generally satisfied within one single virialized halo , but it can be achieved through averaging over many halos .",
    "although there is clear evidence for the similarities among halos of different mass , we are still concerned of any dependence of @xmath57 on the halo mass . we have started a program to simulate 50 halos at each mass range of clusters , groups , and galaxies , 150 halos in total .",
    "this will reduce the uncertainty of @xmath57 to @xmath64 for each mass range and will show the dependence of @xmath57 on the halo mass , if any",
