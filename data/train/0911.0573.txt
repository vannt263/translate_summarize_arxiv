    "in this paper we study the impact of the long - range scalar interactions ( lrsi ) in the dark matter ( dm ) sector @xcite on some properties of the dark matter haloes .",
    "lrsi was proposed to overcome some difficulties that @xmath1 model faces at scales important to the galaxy formation .",
    "large - scale clustering of lrsi cosmologies was studied in @xcite . here",
    "we will study dm haloes density profiles , mass accretion histories , shape and spin parameters .",
    "we model the lrsi in dm sector by introducing modifications to the newtonian gravity .",
    "effective gravitational potential mimicking fifth force between two dm particles of mass @xmath2 is @xmath3 here @xmath4 is newton s constant ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the particle separation vector in real and comoving coordinates .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter measures the relative strength of the scalar - interaction compared to the usual gravitational interaction , while the @xmath8 parameters is yukawa - like screening length and it measures the effective range of the scalar interactions .",
    "accordingly , the modified potential gives rise to a modified force law between dm particles .",
    "the new expression for the force law is @xmath9\\;\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eqn : force - law1}\\ ] ]    to study the structure formation and collapse of dm halos we use publicly available ` gadget2 ` code by volker springel @xcite . `",
    "gadget2 ` is a hybrid n - body code that uses two different methods of calculating the particle forces . at large scales",
    "it uses a particle - mesh approach , an algorithm in which the fast fourier transform method is used on a uniform lattice grid to solve the poisson equation for gravitational potential .",
    "then the potential is used to derive particles accelerations .",
    "we use eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : yukawa ] ) to modify the green s functions in the @xmath10 space to obtain modified gravitational potentail . at small scales",
    "the code use oct - tree algorithm for obtaining the particle forces .",
    "we have implemented the eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : force - law1 ] ) in ` gadget2 ` to obtain the modified force - law ( see ref .",

    "( ahf ) , kindly provided to the public by a.  knebe & s.  knollmann @xcite .",
    "we have preformed a series of n - body simulations in boxes of width @xmath11 containing @xmath12 dm particles .",
    "therefore the mass resolution ( mass of a single particle ) in our numerical experiments was @xmath13 .",
    "cosmology used in our simulation assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    to allow for a direct comparison between corresponding halo in different models , we identify a galactic halo in the @xmath16cdm run and then we cross - corelate ( c - c ) this halo with another halo found in the simulations with lrsi . as a criteria for matching halo we use : ( a ) - the same origin in space ( in vicinity of @xmath17 at redshift of first identification ) ; ( b ) - proximity of the final space occupation ; ( c ) - adjacency of the velocity vector at @xmath18 ; ( d ) - the mass criteria ( related halo in the lrsi model can not excess five times the original @xmath16cdm halo mass ) .",
    "we begin by studying the shape of the density profiles of the c - c haloes . in the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] on the left we show density profiles ( solid lines ) of the c - c haloes together with the best fits to the nfw profile @xcite ( dotted line ) : @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath8 are scaling density and scaling radius respectively .",
    "arrows mark the distance from the center of the halo corresponding to the doubled force resolution @xmath21kpc .",
    "we decided to not trust the results , below this distance , because they can be highly affected by two - body scattering .",
    "we note that for that particular halo nfw fit is not so good , especially for a halo in the model with @xmath22 , @xmath23mpc , and @xmath24 , @xmath23mpc .",
    "nevertheless it is striking to depict , that the modified force - law and the modified potential do not change the universal shape of the halo density profile , known from the @xmath1 n - body simulations .    on the right side of the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we plot mass accretion histories ( mah s ) of the c - c haloes ( solid lines ) versus the expansion factor @xmath25 . following the procedure presented in @xcite we fit mah to the simple exponential law , given by : @xmath26,\\qquad z_f = { 2\\over\\alpha } - 1\\;\\ ; , \\label{eqn : mah}\\ ] ] where @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 is the halo mass at @xmath18 , @xmath29 is the scaling parameter , @xmath25 is the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath30 is the formation redshift defined with the help of the @xmath29 parameter .",
    "we also plot best fits to mah s for a single c - c halo . from these plots",
    "we see that c - c haloes in cosmologies with lrsi tend to have much higher formation redshifts @xmath30 . except cases with @xmath31 , @xmath32kpc and @xmath22 , @xmath33mpc ,",
    "c - c haloes in modified cosmologies have much quieter recent accretion histories then the @xmath16cdm case .",
    "especially when we look at mahs of c - c haloes with @xmath31 and @xmath34 or @xmath35mpc , we note that these haloes have not experienced any major merger since @xmath36 , and then they accreted mass steadily until present time .",

    "( [ eqn : mah ] ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we turn to the statistical properties of the haloes formed in our simulations .",
    "we average three shape parameters and the spin parameter over all haloes found in simulation boxes which satisfy this mass criterion @xmath48 .",
    "we present results in table [ tab:2 ] . clearly , the presence of the scalar interactions does not change shapes of the haloes .",
    "triaxiality and ellipticities are converging to the values of the @xmath1 case within one sigma errors . on the other hand we can note , that halos in cosmology with the lrsi , tend to have higher spin parameters .",
    "we have performed n - body simulations of structure formation in cosmologies with the additional long - range scalar interactions in the dark matter .",
    "we have studied the impact of such modification of the standard @xmath1 cosmological model on the c - c haloes and on the averaged statistical properties of the halo family .",
    "we conclude that the outer parts of the c - c halo density profile do not show any significant deviations from the @xmath1 halo density profile . we have to note though , that the c - c halos of our choice had their virial radii smaller then the screening length of scalar interactions models considered here",
    ". it will be interesting to study the inner most parts of the density profiles of cross - corelated haloes . to do that a much higher resolutions in forces and in masses are needed .",
    "we have also studied the mah s of the c - c haloes . here",
    "we see clear imprint of the lrsi on the mass accretion histories .",
    "haloes in modified gravity have much higher formation redshifts , and they tend to show less mergers at small redshifts .",
    "this indicates that , in cosmology with the lrsi , small - scale structures like dm haloes form at earlier epochs and support the picture of galaxies being island universes at low redshifts .",
    "these results are encouraging in the view of apparent difficulties of reconciling the predictions from the @xmath1 cosmology galaxy formation simulations with astronomical observations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "we have also measured averaged shape and spin parameters of the halo populations .",
    "we conclude that lrsi does not affect the shape of the haloes .",
    "however we see a clear signal in the spin parameter .",
    "dm haloes with lrsi have more angular momenta than their cousins in the @xmath1 case .",
    "the research presented here is just a first step in understanding how additional long - range interactions in the dark matter can affect various properties of the gravitationally bounded dm haloes . to study this matter in greater detail a more advanced study is needed .",
    "we have showed that modified gravity imprints on average halo spin and on particular halo mass accretion histories .",
    "therefore it will be , in principle , possible to distinguish between the @xmath1 and lrsi models using data from future detailed galaxy surveys ."
