    "<S> this paper is devoted to study the stability / instability of the expansionfree self gravitating source in the framework of einstein gauss - bonnet gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the source has been taken as tolman - bondi model which is homogenous in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations as dynamical equations have been evaluated in gauss - bonnet gravity in five dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the junction conditions as well as cavity evaluations equations have been explored in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation scheme of first order has been applied to dynamical as einstein gauss - bonnet field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of newtonian as well post newtonian approximation have been used to derive general dynamical stability equations . in general this equation </S>",
    "<S> represents the stability of the gravitating source . </S>",
    "<S> some particular values of system parameters have been chosen to prove the concept of stability graphically . </S>",
    "<S> it has been mentioned that other than chosen the particular values of the parameters the stability of the system will be disturbed , hence it would leads to instability .    </S>",
