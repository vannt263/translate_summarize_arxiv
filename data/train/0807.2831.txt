    "in the last few years , there have been numerous discoveries of ultra - faint milky way satellites , primarily because the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) allows the detection of galaxies with central surface brightnesses as faint as @xmath6 mag arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the new discoveries include 10 new milky way dwarf galaxies , together with 4 unusually extended or faint globular clusters  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to announce the discovery of an additional milky way satellite , probably a dwarf galaxy that may be undergoing disruption , at a heliocentric distance of @xmath8 kpc in the constellation of leo . following the convention for naming dwarf spheroidals , we call it leo  v. it lies very close to one of our other recent discoveries , namely leo  iv  @xcite",
    ". hence , it is a companion to a companion of the milky way galaxy .",

    "sdss imaging data are produced in five photometric bands , namely @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the data are automatically processed through pipelines to measure photometric and astrometric properties @xcite and de - reddened using @xcite .",
    "data release 6 ( dr6 ) covers @xmath28 square degrees , primarily around the north galactic pole .",
    "@xcite argued that almost all the satellites in sdss dr5 had been found and that any further candidates would require substantial followup imaging to confirm their nature .",
    "accordingly , we pursued the strategy of acquiring deeper imaging of possible candidates of lower statistical significance than @xmath29 ( see eq ( 7 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "this is of course rather inefficient , and generally yields negative results . as the significance is lowered , there are many candidates that are selected , due to poisson noise and false positives induced by large - scale structure .",
    "additional reasons are thus needed to warrant the expenditure of time and effort . in the case of",
    "leo  v , its actual significance is @xmath30 , but the presence of possible blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars in the sdss data was such an indicator .",

    "there is a visible overdensity in stars at the location of leo  v , but the background shows extensive substructure , leaving the nature of any object unclear .",
    "there is also an overdensity of galaxies close to the location of leo  v. fine - tuning the selection of stars from the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to likely members , however , does yield a convincing object , as shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : leo_disc ] .",
    "the lower panels show three cmds .",
    "the first is restricted to stars within @xmath31 of the center of leo  v , and shows a tentative red giant branch ( rgb ) and a handful of horizontal branch stars . on moving outwards to stars within @xmath32 , the horizontal branch swells and",
    "the red clump becomes visible .",

    "there is a convincing detection of the red giant and horizontal branch .",

    "follow - up observations of leo  v were made on 7/8 march 2008 ( ut ) using the 2.5 m int telescope and the wfc mosaic camera , with four 2k@xmath414k pixel eev ccds , a field of view of roughly 30@xmath4130 , and a scale of @xmath42 pixel@xmath3 at the field center .",
    "leo  v was observed with total integrations of 1800s in @xmath24 and @xmath25 filters , split into 3@xmath41600s with @xmath43 shifts in - between each exposure . the typical seeing measured directly from the images was rather poor , varying between @xmath44 .",
    "data were reduced using a general purpose pipeline for processing wide - field optical ccd data  @xcite .",
    "images were de - biased , trimmed , cross - talk corrected , and then flatfielded and gain - corrected to a common internal system using clipped median stacks of nightly twilight flats . for each image frame , an object catalog was generated and used to update the world coordinate system prior to stacking each set of 3 frames .",
    "a final set of object catalogs were generated from the stacked images and objects were morphologically classified as stellar or non - stellar ( or noise - like ) .",
    "the detected objects in each passband were then merged by positional coincidence ( within @xmath45 ) to form a combined @xmath46 catalog and photometrically calibrated on the sdss system using stars in common .    with the poorer than average",
    "seeing , the int data are only about @xmath47 magnitude deeper than the sdss data .",
    "[ fig : leo_int ] shows the cmds of stars within @xmath48 and @xmath49 from the center .",
    "there is some improvement in the tightness of the red giant branch and especially the horizontal branch .",
    "the bhbs are now aligned with the ridgeline derived from m92 , which is used to measure the distance to leo  v as @xmath50 kpc .",
    "having fixed the distance , we can experiment with different stellar populations , shown in the first panel by the ridgelines of m92 ( solid ) and m13 ( dotted ) .",
    "m13 ( [ fe / h ] = -1.54 ) has a giant branch that is too red , while the more metal - poor m92 ( [ fe / h ] = -2.28 ) is a closer match to the stellar population .",
    "we also show masks wrapped around the red giant and horizontal branches which are used to select the candidate members for fig .",
    "[ fig : leo_dens ] .",
    "the two populations are distributed differently ; most of the light from the rgb stars is limited to the inner @xmath48 , whereas the bhb stars extend out to at least @xmath51 .",
    "this phenomenon has been seen in other dsphs such as carina and sculptor  @xcite    the number density of stars defined by the rgb and bhb selection boxes is sharply peaked in the central region with a half - light radius , from plummer and exponential model fits , of @xmath520.8@xmath53 , or 42 pc for a distance of 180 kpc .",
    "however , the profile also shows an extended plume of stars slightly above the general background level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : leo_dens ] ) . this extended appearance makes the luminosity of the satellite difficult to estimate directly .",
    "we first converted the number density radial profile to a ( luminosity - weighted ) surface brightness profile to directly estimate the central surface brightness . integrating the plummer law model fit",
    "then gives a total flux from resolved stars .",
    "comparison with the m92 luminosity function suggests we are missing roughly 1/2 of the light from fainter members which would yield a total magnitude in the central @xmath48 radius region of m@xmath54 .",
    "this number is a lower limit on the luminosity , as it ignores any contribution at larger radius , such as from the plume .",
    "we obtained spectra of 159 red giant candidates using the hectochelle fiber spectrograph at the mmt 6.5-m telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona .",
    "spectroscopic targets were selected from the red giant branch of leo v ( figure  [ fig : leo_velocity ] ) within a field of radius 30@xmath55 , centered on the object . the hectochelle spectra sample at high resolution ( @xmath56 ) the wavelength range @xmath57  , which includes the prominent magnesium triplet ( mgt ) absorption feature .",
    "for each of two distinct hectochelle configurations targeting leo v , we obtained @xmath58s exposures during the nights of 28 and 29 may 2008 .",
    "spectra were reduced following a procedure described by @xcite . for each star",
    "we measure the ( solar rest frame ) line - of - sight velocity , @xmath19 , by cross - correlating the spectrum against a high - s / n template of known velocity .",
    "we also measure the pseudo - equivalent width of the mgt feature , @xmath40 mg , using the technique of @xcite .",
    "the data include 70 stars with int photometry , of which 52 lie inside the mask shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : leo_velocity ] .",
    "we calculate errors in @xmath19 and @xmath40 mg from models which consider the quality of the cross - correlation function and spectral s / n , respectively ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : leo_velocity ] shows the cmd of the int stars with the candidate selection mask superimposed .",
    "this is slightly broader than the one shown in the rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : leo_int ] , to include all possible candidates .",
    "solid dots show stars with spectra , gray lie outside the mask and black lie inside .",
    "we circle the five most probable leo  v members , which have a mean velocity of 173.3 @xmath59 3.1 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the remaining three panels show the correlation between @xmath25 magnitude , distance from center and @xmath40 mg .",
    "note in particular that in the plane of ( @xmath60 mg ) , the giants in leo  v are clearly separated from the dwarfs in the thick disk and halo of the milky way .",
    "it is also clear that there are 2 more possible members that lie at large distance from the center .",
    "leo  v is most probably a new dwarf galaxy , based on the presence of an old , metal - poor population with a characteristic size of between 50 and 200 pc .",
    "there are several hints that it may be a disrupting satellite , but our data do not support the idea that it is merely an overdensity in a stellar stream .",
    "the most remarkable feature of leo  v is the disparity in the spatial extent of the rgb and bhb populations .",
    "the red giants are confined to a tight core of @xmath61 pc , whereas the bhbs extend out at least as far as 200 pc .",
    "there even appear to be bhbs associated with leo  v at distances of 500 pc .",
    "one possible explanation for the apparent difference is that the rgb stars do follow the bhbs much further out , perhaps because the object is disintegrating , but they are more difficult to distinguish from the foreground populations in our data .",
    "a hint that this the case is perhaps provided by the two rgb candidates that are even further than the most distant bhbs , although their membership needs to be confirmed . with deeper photometry reaching down to the turn - off , it should be possible to verify this hypothesis .",
    "another explanation is that the rgb and bhb populations probe different epochs of star formation in an ultra - low mass system .",
    "leo  v s possible association with leo  iv is also unique .",
    "although there are other examples of dsphs separated on the sky by a few degrees  such as cvn  i and cvn  ii  they are at different distances and velocities . by contrast , leo  iv is at a heliocentric distance of @xmath62 kpc  @xcite and a heliocentric velocity of @xmath63 kms@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "these are very close to our estimates of @xmath0 kpc and @xmath64 kms@xmath3 for the distance and velocity of leo  v. referred to the galactic standard of rest , the velocities of leo  iv and v are low , @xmath65 kms@xmath3 and @xmath66 kms@xmath3 respectively . using the velocity distribution for the @xmath67 radial profiles given in @xcite to construct artificial samples of 50 satellites , we estimate that there is a @xmath68 per cent probability of this coincidence happening by chance .",
    "we remark that one of bhb stars considered by @xcite for possible membership of leo  iv , but then discarded , has a heliocentric velocity of @xmath69 kms@xmath3 .",
    "this hints at the possible existence of extended stellar structures around leo  iv and leo  v. if leo  iv and leo  v are assumed to be on the same stream , then the orbit can be computed , assuming a singular isothermal sphere with amplitude @xmath70 = 220 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the pericenter is @xmath62 kpc and the apocenter is @xmath71 , so that the eccentricity is modest ( @xmath72 ) and the orbit never approaches the inner parts of the milky way ( in which case both objects should be relatively intact , at odds with their seemingly irregular appearances ) .",
    "leo  v may prove to be an important object for testing theories of galaxy formation .",
    "@xcite has argued that very old dwarf galaxies must form preferentially in chain structures , tracing the filamentary dark matter in the early universe .",
    "these chains or groups of dwarfs may retain some of their integrity even on accretion and merging into the milky way halo .",
    "is it possible that leo  iv and leo  v are two links in such a chain ?      funding for the sdss and sdss - ii has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
