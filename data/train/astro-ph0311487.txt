    "detailed studies of gas and stellar kinematics near the centers of present - day galaxies have revealed that almost all galaxy spheroids ( ellipticals and bulges of spirals ) host super - massive black holes , with masses @xmath4 , or @xmath5 of the total stellar mass of their parent galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although most of these black holes are not associated with quasar activity today , presumably they represent the now - dormant counterparts to the quasar - powering engines known to exist at high redshift @xcite .",
    "indeed , under reasonable assumptions , the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be explained by modeling mass accretion onto black holes that have the same range of masses as observed in local spheroids ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the standard expectation is that once a primordial galaxy is populated with a `` seed '' black hole at some early time , the black hole can grow via the accretion of available gas and , in the process , give off light in proportion to its eddington luminosity .",
    "the seed population is an important ingredient in any model that aims to explain agn or local black holes , but the origin and nature of these objects remain unknown . in this paper , we provide a model for producing rather massive ( @xmath6 ) seed black holes at early times from high density , low angular momentum gas in rare halos .",
    "we argue that massive , early forming seeds help explain the high redshift agn population , and , unlike lower mass seeds , may give rise to the observed correlations between host galaxy properties and black hole masses without the need for fine - tuned feedback .",
    "consider , for example the analysis of @xcite , who have estimated a mass of @xmath7 for a black hole powering a @xmath8 quasar found in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "for the cosmology adopted below , the age of the universe at this redshift is @xmath9 myr .",
    "even the remnant of a very massive , early - forming star of @xmath10 would have to accrete mass at the eddington limit for @xmath11 e - folding times in order to grow to the observed mass .",
    "for a standard , thin - disk accretion model with an efficiency @xmath12 , the e - folding salpeter time is @xmath13 myrs , so an intermediate - mass seed would require @xmath14 myrs of accretion in order to reach to observed mass , corresponding to a formation redshift for the seed of @xmath15 .",
    "this is an extremely early redshift in the context of structure formation , since the minimum halo mass for @xmath16 cooling at this time represents a @xmath17 fluctuation . while this does not completely rule out the possibility that the seed was small , it does require an extremely rare event .",
    "a @xmath18 seed , on the other hand , would require @xmath19 e - folding times of accretion , and thus a more recent formation redshift @xmath20 .",
    "of course these numbers are sensitive to certain assumptions , and may be influenced by allowing low efficiency accretion or super - eddington luminosities .",
    "nevertheless , it is generally easier to understand the population of @xmath21 quasars if massive seeds are present ( see also haiman & loeb 2001 for a related discussion ) .    perhaps the most intriguing clues to the nature of black hole formation and growth are the strong correlations between black hole masses and global properties of their host spheroids  scales that differ by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the black hole mass is tightly correlated with the central velocity dispersion of the spheroid , and shows a significant correlation with the spheroid luminosity or mass .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to connect the galaxy - formation process originating on scales of megaparsecs with the black - hole formation processes on sub - parsec scales .",
    "in addition , the epoch of spheroid formation is likely much later than the time when the first quasar black holes begin to shine , so an additional challenge is to connect these two components in time , in a way that maintains , or even creates , the observed local correlations .",
    "several scenarios have been presented for the formation of massive black hole seeds .",
    "the general frameworks range from those that rely on the coalescence of massive stellar remnants that sink to the galaxy centers @xcite to one that models black hole growth via ballistic particle capture during bulge collapse @xcite .",
    "other models are based on the hydro - dynamical evolution of super - massive objects formed directly out of primordial gas @xcite .",
    "our model is related most closely to this third type of scenario .",
    "the key obstacle in any model of black hole formation is clearly the centrifugal barrier . in the standard cosmological framework of hierarchical structure formation ,",
    "proto - haloes acquire angular momentum by tidal torques exerted by the background fluctuation field @xcite .",
    "haloes obtain a specific angular momentum that is on average @xmath22 times smaller than that required for centrifugal support at the virial halo size ( with a spin parameter of @xmath23 , see below ) .",
    "this is roughly independent of mass and time .",
    "thus , even after cooling , most of the gas can contract only to radii 10 - 100 times smaller than the initial halo radius before it is halted in circular orbits .",
    "the implied scale ( at @xmath24 ) is @xmath25kpc , many orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding schwarzschild radius , @xmath26pc .",
    "the situation may get even worse at earlier times because the typical collapsing mass @xmath27 is smaller in proportion to a high power of the expansion factor @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the ratio of the centrifugally supported size ( @xmath29 ) to the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath30 if the black hole mass is a constant fraction of the halo mass ) increases dramatically at early times , unless the sites of black hole formation are rare haloes much more massive than @xmath27 .",
    "this line of argument indicates that the seed black holes originate from material at the very lowest end of the angular - momentum distribution within rare , massive haloes at high redshift .",
    "this material should then perhaps lose all its angular momentum via an effective mechanism of angular momentum transfer , which would be enhanced in such a high - density environment .",
    "@xcite considered the sites of black hole formation to be the very high density discs which form in those rare haloes that have extremely low total angular momentum . assuming a standard cdm scenario",
    ", they used an analytic model to predict the distribution of halo spins and estimated the abundance of haloes with low enough spin for efficient viscosity @xcite .",
    "they argued that there may be enough low - spin haloes to explain the black hole abundance .",
    "they then adopted the common view that viscosity in a differentially rotating gaseous disc is the mechanism that transfers angular momentum outward , thus allowing gas to contract into a black hole . in their calculations , they considered hydrodynamic ( or perhaps hydro - magnetic ) turbulence to be the viscous mechanism responsible for the angular momentum loss , and appealed to the @xmath31-disc prescription @xcite",
    ".    our approach is related , but qualitatively different .",
    "we propose a scenario where seed black holes form from material with low angular momentum in all haloes that are massive enough to host an unstable self - gravitating disc .",
    "the required high - density discs can only occur in haloes that collapse at high redshift , @xmath32 , when the angular momentum distribution of the ( unprocessed ) gas should be the most similar to that of the dark matter , and before reionization or some other feedback mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prevents the growth of cold discs .",
    "the crucial point is that every halo , regardless of its total angular momentum , is expected to have a distribution of specific angular momentum including a tail of low - spin material .",
    "the haloes we consider are massive enough so that the baryons trapped in their potential wells can cool and condense . in the absence of any other effect that may alter the angular momentum content of baryons ,",
    "the lowest spin baryonic material in each system ends in a high - density central region forming a proto - galactic disc . as an illustrative fiducial model ,",
    "we assume that the angular - momentum distribution in each halo matches the `` universal '' distribution of @xcite ( b01 hereafter ) .",
    "if the angular momentum is approximately preserved during baryonic infall into the disk , the b01 angular momentum distribution implies that the inner disk becomes self gravitating with the surface density inversely proportional to the radius .",
    "we show below that if this behavior extends below the inner @xmath33 of the disc radius , then enough mass may acquire a high enough density for viscosity to efficiently redistribute the angular momentum of the disc . for the final contraction of disc material into a black hole we evaluate the angular - momentum loss by the effective kinematic viscosity that arises from gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is somewhat more efficient than that from a typical @xmath31-disc model .",
    "this viscosity - driven mass inflow can not continue indefinitely ; once the disc significantly fragments , or once it is heated or even disrupted by feedback , the inflow stops .    the semi - quantitative scenario presented here can be regarder as an illustration of a general model based on the assumption that proto - galactic gaseous discs develop high density inner regions dominated by low angular momentum material .",
    "our current analysis is basically a feasibility study of such a model , and an attempt to recover its robust predictions and to constrain the model parameters by theoretical considerations as well as by the observations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in   [ sec : profile ] we discuss the angular momentum distribution in proto - galaxies and the implied surface density profile for the cold discs . in ",
    "[ sec : viscosity ] we investigate the effect of kinetic viscosity on the evolution of the disc . in ",
    "[ sec : mass ] we calculate the resulting seed black hole mass and mass function . in   [ sec : density ] we calculate the redshift evolution of the seed black hole mass density . in ",
    "[ sec : correlation ] we make a preliminary attempt to address the correlation between the masses of black holes and galactic stellar spheroids , to be pursued in a subsequent paper . in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] we summarize our conclusions and discuss our results .",
    "when necessary , we assume a @xmath34cdm cosmology , with a hubble constant @xmath35 ( @xmath36 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 ) , universal mass density @xmath38 , cosmological constant @xmath39 , and rms fluctuation amplitude @xmath40 .",
    "we focus on the proto - galaxies forming in the redshift range @xmath41 . in the standard picture of structure formation , galaxies form as a uniform mixture of dark matter and baryons in small over - densities that grow by gravitational instability . until its expansion turns around into a collapse , each halo acquires angular momentum through tidal torques induced by the density fluctuations around it .",
    "the dissipationless collapse brings the dark matter into virial equilibrium in an extended spheroidal halo . in the presence of an efficient cooling mechanism , gas cools and",
    "condenses to a centrifugally supported disc .",
    "atomic line cooling can bring the gas to @xmath42k , and further cooling down to @xmath43k requires the presence of molecular hydrogen .",

    "the haloes we consider below are just above the limit for atomic line cooling and significantly above the limit for molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "we therefore expect the gas to cool and settle in an angular momentum supported disc on a timescale comparable to the dynamical time : @xmath47 where we have assumed our standard cosmological parameters and @xmath48 is the virial overdensity in units of @xmath49 times the background density . , where @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 is the ratio of the mean matter density to critical density at redshift @xmath52 . in the @xmath34cdm cosmology that we adopt , @xmath53 and @xmath54 at high redshift , approaching the standard cdm ( @xmath55 ) value . ] .",
    "hereafter , due to the small redshift dependence of @xmath56 at the redshifts of interest we set @xmath57 .",

    "b01 found that in each halo the cumulative mass with specific angular momentum less than @xmath67 is described well by the function @xmath68 this profile has an implicit maximum specific angular momentum @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 characterizes the shape of the angular momentum distribution .",
    "when @xmath73 the deviation from a power law is pronounced with a larger fraction of the mass having low specific angular momentum , while if @xmath74 the distribution resembles a pure power law .",
    "the key property of this distribution is that at least half of the halo mass is in the power - law regime , @xmath75 , and the simulations confirm that the power - law behavior extends at least over two decades in mass , down to @xmath76 of the total halo mass .",
    "the b01 profile was confirmed by @xcite and @xcite using n - body simulations , and by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite using adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "these studies reveal that the b01 angular momentum distribution remains a good fit to haloes at redshifts as high as @xmath77 .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the distribution holds at much higher redshifts , @xmath3 .",
    "since the @xmath34cdm universe is effectively einstein - de sitter beyond @xmath78 , and the power spectrum is effectively a power law in the relevant mass range , one expects self - similarity between the haloes at @xmath79 and at @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the profile at @xmath3 can be assumed to resemble the b01 shape derived at @xmath24 .",
    "simple theoretical considerations ( b01 , @xcite ) argue that this angular momentum distribution is a natural outcome of the hierarchical clustering process .",
    "a qualitatively similar distribution is obtained when linear tidal torque theory is applied to haloes shell by shell , or when the orbital angular momentum of merging haloes turns into spin of the product halo via tidal stripping and dynamical friction .",
    "other justifications follow from more detailed models @xcite .",
    "these analytic models provide addivtional support to the assumption that a similar average halo profile is valid at low and high redshifts .    as mentioned above , the b01 distribution is a good fit to simulation results for angular momentum as small as @xmath80 the characteristic angular momentum of the halo ( corresponding to @xmath81 the characteristic disc radius . as discussed below ( see eq . 13 ) , our calculation assumes that the b01 form holds on scales below @xmath82 of the characteristic angular momentum , so only a mild extrapolation of the low angular momentum tail is required , and being a power law , this extrapolation seems plausible .",
    "nevertheless , the angular momentum distribution of the gas may not exactly mirror that of the dark matter . in order to evaluate the qualitative effects of this possibility and the explore alternative extrapolations , we will also condier deviations from the b01 distribution .    [",
    "fig : fig1 ] . note that in our fiducial case of @xmath83 ( b01 ) , this function approaches a constant at small @xmath67 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=279 ]    unlike the analysis in b01 ( but see @xcite ) , other works such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite focused on estimating the fraction of dark mass with negative angular momentum ( in the direction of the total halo spin ) , and claimed that this fraction may be as large as @xmath84 .   by using the b01 profile as is we actually adopt the conservative approach which minimizes the efficency of black - hole formation , as follows .",
    "if a fraction of the gas starts with negative spin , it will mix dissipatively with the positive - spin gas leading to a purely rotating disc with no negative component .",
    "the implications on the disc formation depends on the way by which this mixing occurs . in the limiting case where the mixing occurs _",
    "after _ the gas has already condensed to the disc , the negative component will mix positive spin material of exactly the same distribution of spin magnitudes .",
    "@xcite . this results in a fraction of mass with near - zero angular momentum , which would increase the efficiency of black - hole production .",
    "if angular momentum mixing occurs during the process of gas cooling and collapse before the disc forms , there is no _ a priori _ reason for the negative angular momentum material to mix with only positive angular momentum material of the same magnitude .",
    "if this mixing is uniform across the angular momentum profile , then the resulting distribution should be similar to the b01 form , but with a slightly smaller overall spin parameter .",
    "the b01 form , ignoring the negative tail , is therefore the conservative case of minimum blak - hole formation .",
    "we assume that the specific angular - momentum distribution of the baryons resembles that of the dark matter halo .",
    "this assumption has been found to hold reasonably well in both radiative and non - radiative hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "this assumption should be valid especially in systems that collapse early , as baryons would not have been affected by feedback associated with star formation .",
    "in addition we assume that the angular momentum of gas is conserved as gas cools and falls to the center forming a centrifugally supported disc .",
    "this assumption is backed by observations , where disc sizes seem to indicate that the angular momentum of the gas gained by tidal torques is retained .",
    "in addition , b01 found that the direction of angular momentum is well aligned at different radii , suggesting that the formation of a disc is indeed possible .",
    "therefore , if there are no significant changes in the specific angular momentum of the baryons during the formation of the disc , then the disc angular - momentum distribution is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the final mass fraction in cold baryons . for the circular orbits in the disc one",
    "has @xmath87 , so one can map the @xmath88 distribution to a radial mass profile in the disc . note that if @xmath89 ( as with the b01 distribution at small @xmath67 ) and the disc has a self - gravitating rotation curve @xmath90 , then @xmath91const . and",
    "@xmath92 regardless of the initial properties of the halo and the possible effects of baryonic contraction on it .",
    "this implies a disc surface density profile of @xmath93 in the inner disc .",
    "since we expect these general trends to hold regardless of our assumptions about the halo profile , we make the simple approximation that the final total mass profile of halo plus disc follows that of an isothermal sphere , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in this case , the disc mass profile implied by the distribution ( [ eq : angprof ] ) is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a characteristic disc radius , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . at @xmath100 , we have again @xmath101 .",

    "this is a conservative estimate for the fraction of baryons that can form enough @xmath114 to cool significantly @xcite .",
    "since our approach relies on an uncertain extrapolation of the b01 distribution , we explore a more general form for the angular momentum distribution , of which b01 is a special case .",
    "we consider the family of angular - momentum distributions that correspond to the following disc surface density profiles , parameterized by @xmath105 , @xmath115 with the normalization constant @xmath116 $ ] .    in fig .  1 we show the differential angular momentum distributions for different values of @xmath105 .",

    "after baryons cool and settle into a dense inner disc , angular momentum is redistributed as a result of viscosity .",
    "we adopt the kinematic viscosity prescription proposed by @xcite ( see @xcite for a detailed test of this picture ) . according to this mechanism , global gravitational instabilities in the disc give rise to a transfer of angular momentum outward , which can be modeled as a local kinematic viscosity .",

    "a disc is gravitationally unstable as long as the minimum size of shear - stabilizing disturbances @xmath125 , is larger than the maximum size of dispersion - supported regions , @xmath126 .",

    "a typical viscous time for mass inflow at a radius @xmath134 in the disc is @xmath135 .",
    "as mass flows in , the central regions of the disc become denser , so the value of @xmath127 decreases .",
    "if at any point @xmath127 became as small as @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the height of the disc , then the instabilities would have become fully dynamical , fragmenting the disc into self - gravitating bodies , which would have stopped the angular momentum transfer .",
    "however , this effect is likely to be unimportant over the timescales of concern here because while @xmath127 is decreasing , the ratio @xmath138 is actually decreasing at a faster rate @xcite , thus delaying the global fragmentation and allowing the viscosity to act until some external process disrupts the disc .",
    "the underlying assumption is that while the global instabilities give rise to density waves , which cause the transfer of angular momentum , the disc does not fragment instantaneously .",
    "star formation can occur concurrently with the viscous process until feedback from the first massive stars stops the gas inflow either by heating the disc or by disrupting it altogether ( if its virial velocity is small enough ) .      only haloes more massive than a critical minimum mass host unstable discs in which the angular - momentum loss is efficient and a seed black hole can form .",

    "black holes can not be smaller than the characteristic seed mass @xmath304 while there is no fixed mass threshold for a progenitor to contain gas that will eventually end up in a spheroid .",
    "this gives rise to a slightly steeper slope in the bottom left of the relation .",
    "the apparent increase in the number of low mass spheroids with no black holes also suggests the presence of a lower mass limit on spheroids hosting black holes , of roughly @xmath305 .",
    "this is a potentially verifiable prediction of the model .",

    "major mergers are quick and have an immediate effect on the growth rate of the spheroid as well as the black hole , while minor mergers take a long time to complete and therefore have a delayed effect that may not materialize in a hubble time @xcite .",
    "when we repeat the calculation under the assumption that _ all _ mergers are instantaneous , ignoring the finite duration of the spiral - in process , we find that the predicted relation between black holes and spheroids remains almost unchanged , with only a slight shift of typically less than 10% towards larger spheroid masses for the same black hole mass .",
    "this small shift is to be expected since the less massive subhaloes that now contribute to the spheroid mass tend to be below the critical mass for seed formation and thus do not add to the black hole mass .",
    "we find the predicted slope of the relationship to be insensitive to the actual value of @xmath224 ( as long as @xmath307 ) .",
    "the normalization of the relation , namely the black - hole mass for a given spheroid mass , is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath224 .",
    "this is because for a lower value of @xmath224 more haloes are able to form a seed and contribute to the merged black - hole mass without affecting the spheroid mass .",

    "for a lower @xmath245 , seed formation takes place in a larger fraction of the haloes that eventually merge to form spheroids . by lowering @xmath245 from 15 to 6",
    "we obtain an order of magnitude increase in black - hole mass . a comparable decrease in black - hole mass",
    "is obtained when increasing @xmath245 from 15 to 20 .",
    "however , the slope of the relation is found to be mildly sensitive to the original scaling between the seed black hole mass and its host halo mass .",
    "if we replace the predicted correlation of our model ( @xmath309 ) with an ad hoc seed assignment to critical - mass haloes at high redshift , e.g. , @xmath310 , we find that the linear @xmath311 relation steepens to roughly @xmath312 .",

    "the build - up of black holes and spheroids is occurring in concert through mergers , thus setting the linear relationship .",
    "a similar linear relation would hold for the final black - hole masses provided that it has not been changed by the subsequent growth experienced by black holes via accretion . if the accretion is proportional to the mass of the seed , as would be the case for accretion at the eddington rate",

    ". of course , the effect of accretion depends on what fraction of the black hole mass was accreted .",
    "if the increase in mass is only by a factor of a few , then one could assume that the role of mergers in setting the observed relationship is important .",
    "on the other hand , if the growth by accretion is by more than an order of magnitude , then the accretion process would have the dominant role in determining the slope of the relation . according to our model , the normalization of the observed relationship",
    "is determined additively by two free parameters : the viscous timescale and the growth via accretion .",

    "we note that in models where the seeds are of smaller masses , @xmath326 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the growth by mergers is negligible and the accretion process has to be tuned with a specific feedback scenario in order to obtain the correct relation between black holes and spheroids .",
    "although we focused here on black hole and spheroid growth , we do not expect all the seed black holes accreted by a dark matter halo to be incorporated in the spheroid .",
    "a number of black holes could be orbiting in haloes of big galaxies .",
    "they could have arisen from subhaloes that were disrupted after entering the host halo .",
    "such a scenario has been investigated by @xcite and the possible observational consequences are explored in @xcite .",
    "we presented a physical model for the production of massive seed black holes at high redshifts , with a characteristic mass @xmath327 .",
    "we argued that this model provides a useful starting point for explaining the observed relation between the masses of today s black holes and the spheroidal components of galaxies .",
    "massive seeds may also help explain the existence of the supermassive black holes associated with luminous agn at @xmath21 .    our model for seed formation",
    "is based on the general idea that the mass in every early - collapsing halo is expected to have a _ distribution _ of specific angular momentum , with at least some fraction of its gas having a much smaller specific angular momentum than is characterized by the global spin parameter of the halo .",
    "after the low - spin gas cools , it can fall into the central region and form a dense disc , where certain viscous processes become effective and may potentially lead to black hole formation .    in our exploration of this idea",
    ", we assumed that the specific angular momentum of the gas is similar to that measured for the dark - matter in n - body simulations . in this case , if angular momentum is conserved during the gas infall , the central gas discs become self - gravitating and toomre unstable in all the haloes above a critical mass .",
    "this critical mass has a median value of @xmath328 at @xmath329 , and it is expected to be scattered log - normally with a ln standard deviation of @xmath330 .",
    "the sites of seed production are thus much more massive than the typical collapsing mass at that time , and are therefore associated with high - sigma peaks in the fluctuation distribution .",
    "gravitational instabilities in the disc drive an effective viscosity that redistributes angular momentum . as a result ,",
    "material from the low angular momentum tail of the distribution loses its angular momentum on a viscous timescale and contribute to the formation of a black hole .",
    "we associate this viscous timescale with the timescale for disruption and/or heating of the disc due to substantial star formation .",
    "we expect this timescale to be on the order of @xmath331 myr , but its exact value is not well determined .",
    "we found that the typical seed black holes , which form in critical mass haloes , have a characteristic mass of @xmath2 , quite insensitive to the epoch of formation .",
    "this predicts a lower bound to possible masses of massive black holes , which can be confronted with observations today .",
    "this scenario should operate continuously as additional haloes grow to above the critical mass and create new potential sites for black - hole formation .",
    "the process is expected to stop , however , when the universe becomes sufficiently reionized that @xmath332 molecules are destroyed and can not provide efficient cooling .",
    "we therefore expect seed black holes to form before @xmath333 .",
    "we showed that the comoving density of mass in seed black holes grows gradually with time , in association with the birthrate of critical mass haloes .",
    "this density becomes comparable to the observed mass density of supermassive black holes by @xmath3 , near the redshift of reionization .",
    "depending on the adopted viscous timescale , there is room for an order of magnitude growth in black hole masses via quasar powering accretion .",
    "we find that a viscous timescale of @xmath334 myr provides quite reasonable results .",
    "we explored the development of a correlation between black - hole mass and spheroid mass in today s galaxies by tracking our early forming massive seed population through a halo merger tree . under the assumption that spheroids form via major mergers",
    ", we showed that the merger process leads naturally to a linear relation between black - hole mass and spheroid mass .",
    "this result is mainly due to the formation of _ massive _ seeds only in rare , high - peak haloes at high redshifts , and is not too sensitive to the details of our seed formation model .",
    "starting with @xmath335 seeds would not lead to a linear correlation via mergers alone ; additional feedback associated with agn accretion is needed .",
    "the seed black holes in our model have masses that are proportional to the virial masses of their host haloes at formation .",
    "we demonstrated that this linear relation is preserved if black holes merge in concert with the hierarchical growth of haloes and spheroids .",
    "one potentially interesting ramification of our scenario is that a population of massive black holes at high redshift might serve to power small quasars , fueled perhaps by low - angular - momentum gas liberated by merger events that occur after the seeds are in place .",
    "@xcite discussed how a population of `` mini - quasars '' like this might be responsible for reionizing the universe at @xmath336 .",
    "however , in their model , the mini - quasar power - sources were intermediate - mass @xmath10 black holes . under similar assumptions",
    ", the massive seed black holes of our model would produce even more ionizing photons per site , and perhaps lead more naturally to an early reionization . in our current scenario",
    "the reionization epoch was an input parameter detached from the black - hole formation process , but , in principle , the accretion onto the seeds themselves could be responsible for the reionization that eventually inhibits further black - hole formation .",
    "our quantitative predictions should not be interpreted too literally .",
    "for example , our fiducial model assumes that the initial angular - momentum distribution of the gas mirrors that of a typical cdm halo , and that it is preserved during disk formation . there is no evidence in local galaxies for discs with inner densities as high as invoked by our model for proto - galaxies .",
    "this might be explained by processes that have altered the gas angular - momentum distribution preferentially at late epochs , such as feedback effects ( e.g. @xcite ) , but one should clearly assign a substantial degree of uncertainty to our model assumption . in order to address this uncertainty , at least qualitatively , we explored the effect of varying the initial angular momentum distribution .",
    "we found that if the low angular momentum tail is as minor as in an exponential disc of a constant - density core ( @xmath337 ) , the resulting seed black holes are too small to be of relevance .",
    "an intermediate case , with @xmath338 , can produce sensible black - hole seeds , comparable to our fiducial case ( @xmath339 ) , provided that the viscosity timescale is slightly longer , @xmath340 myr . for @xmath164 ,",
    "the critical halo mass becomes @xmath341 at @xmath342 , and the inner @xmath343 of the disc mass manages to lose its angular momentum by viscosity and produce a black hole of mass @xmath344 .",
    "this seed mass is larger than in the fiducial case , but the seeds in this case are rarer events ( see figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to recover a similar total mass density in black holes , the viscosity must operate for a longer duration .",
    "the actual low angular - momentum tail of the gas distribution remains an unknown , which will hopefully be constrained by future , more realistic hydrodynamical simulations , properly including feedback and other important physical effects .    in conclusion",
    ", while the model presented here is clearly idealized , it does provide a useful example for the kind of mechanism needed to connect cosmological structure formation on galactic scales to black - hole formation on much smaller scales .",
    "observations suggest the presence of massive black holes at high redshifts and therefore the need for the formation of massive seed black holes at still earlier times .",
    "according to our scenario , the observed correlations of black hole and galaxy properties are directly linked to the hierarchical nature of structure formation itself , and owe their existence to rare systems forming in association with the first light .",
