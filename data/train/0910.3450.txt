    "electrons hopping on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice and the square lattice with a half magnetic flux quantum piercing each plaquette ( @xmath0-flux lattice ) exhibit , near half filling , a linearly dispersing excitation spectrum characteristic of massless dirac fermions .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is realized in single layer graphene@xcite while the @xmath0-flux square lattice has the potential to be realized in artificially engineered semiconductor heterostructures.@xcite such massless dirac fermions exhibit a host of fascinating properties which underlie much of the current interest in graphene and the related systems .",
    "although dirac fermions in graphene are intrinsically massless , it is interesting to contemplate the effects on its electronic properties of a bandgap that would give rise to _ massive _ dirac fermions . experimentally , such a bandgap can be realized by placing graphene on a specific substrate@xcite that breaks the sublattice symmetry .",
    "even more interesting is the possibility of the interaction - driven gap , resulting in a mott insulating behavior . aside from the conventional charge density wave ( cdw ) and",
    "spin density wave ( sdw ) instabilities , the structure of graphene allows for more interesting phases such as the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) phase discussed by haldane@xcite and the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase.@xcite these phases are characterized by nontrivial topological invariants@xcite and exhibit the quantum hall effect in absence of magnetic field and the quantum spin - hall effect , respectively .",
    "although , as far as we know , these phases do not occur in natural graphene , the qsh phase was predicted to occur@xcite and subsequently observed@xcite in hgte quantum wells .",
    "also , theoretical studies of these phases led to the pioneering work on topological insulators in two and three spatial dimensions.@xcite    another interesting gapped phase on the honeycomb lattice is the kekul phase , illustrated in fig .",
    "the kekul phase is topologically trivial but it is characterized by a z@xmath1 order parameter .",
    "the latter describes three degenerate kekul ground states , obtained by translating the pattern depicted in fig .",
    "1b by the bravais lattice primitive vectors .",
    "singly quantized vortices in the phase of this order parameter have been shown to possess a stable fermionic zero mode , carry fractional charge@xcite @xmath2 , and obey fractional exchange statistics.@xcite similar physics is realized in the dimerized phase on the @xmath0-flux square lattice.@xcite    in order to map out these interesting phases , raghu _",
    "et al._@xcite studied a simple model describing fermions , both spinless and spinful , on the honeycomb lattice with short range interactions .",
    "they found phase diagrams containing cdw , sdw , qah and qsh order but did not consider the possibility of the kekul phase . with the goal of complementing this previous work we study similar models and find that the kekul phase is in fact present over a large portion of the phase diagram .",
    "specifically , for spinless fermions , kekul order is established when the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) repulsion parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are of similar size . on the @xmath0-flux square lattice",
    "we obtain a phase diagram with the kekul phase replaced by a simpler dimerized phase having similar properties .",
    "in addition , we find stripe phases that tend to dominate over the qah and the dimerized phases when @xmath5 is large .",
    "nevertheless , when the third - neighbor repulsion @xmath6 is included , the kekul and qah phases are stabilized over a portion of the phase diagram . for spinful fermions ,",
    "the possibility of a novel spin - kekul phase characterized by the emergence of spatially modulated spin - dependent hopping amplitude is explored .",
    "having a mean - field theory of the dimerized phase for the @xmath0-flux model allows us to perform a self - consistent calculation of the electronic structure for a system having a vortex in the dimer order parameter , which is set up in a fashion similar to ref .  .",
    "the underlying @xmath7 symmetry of the lattice raises the issue of whether it is realistic to talk of @xmath8 vortices in such a system , but as we have shown previously the 4-fold anisotropy induced by the lattice is very weak and should support such vortices on length scales long compared to the lattice spacing .",
    "further evidence is supplied here to support this claim .",
    "we begin with the tight - binding hamiltonian for spinless fermions with nn and nnn interactions , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the creation operator for a fermion on site @xmath13 of the square or honeycomb lattice , the peierls phase factor @xmath14 is defined on a link @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the hopping amplitude between nn sites , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energy scales for nn and nnn interactions respectively and @xmath19 is the number operator .",
    "we focus on hamiltonians @xmath20 that produce dirac - type spectra for fermions in the absence of interactions .    in the following we treat @xmath21 in the mean - field ( mf ) approximation which should provide reliable information about the possible gapped phases in the phase diagram .",
    "we consider both the on - site and bond mf decoupling channels , @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 belonging to nn and nnn bonds .",
    "the system has a half magnetic flux quantum @xmath25 per plaquette . in this case",
    "the assumption of spinless fermions is quite natural because within the context of the realization described in ref .",
    "the electron spins would be polarized along the field . as in ref .  , we choose the landau gauge @xmath26 where we have set the lattice spacing to unity and work at half filling .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian then has a spectrum @xmath27 with dirac points at @xmath28 .",
    "the repulsive interactions can produce semi - metal ( sm ) , charge density wave ( cdw ) , quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) , stripe and dimerized phases .",
    "the unit cell for this set up has four basis sites and is displayed in fig .",
    "[ lattice]a .",
    "the sm phase corresponds to the undistorted @xmath0-flux lattice , which has no gap in the spectrum .",
    "the cdw corresponds to a modulation in charge density in both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions resulting in a checkerboard pattern on the lattice , whereas the stripe phase will be modulated only along one direction , hence giving rise to ` stripes ' of increased / decreased charge density .",
    "we use the following ansatz , @xmath31 for these two phases where @xmath32 .",
    "the qah phase , which is characterized by a quantized hall conductance without landau levels , occurs when a gap opens due to the spontaneous breaking of time reversal invariance .",
    "we require here that its order parameter , @xmath33 , produces a nnn hopping consistent with a half - flux quantum per unit cell",
    ".    the dimerized phase , with its order parameter @xmath34 along nn this time , will act to increase / decrease the existing hopping amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "it can nominally take on any value locally , but we concentrate on either constant dimerization or one that will support the quasi u(1 ) vortices mentioned above .",

    ", we may calculate the free energy @xmath55 where @xmath56 and the summation is over all four branches of @xmath57 . the ground state is then obtained by minimizing @xmath58 with respect to each of the order parameters .",
    "this yields a set of gap equations ( listed in appendix a ) from which the phase diagram ( at @xmath59 ) seen in fig .",
    "[ pda]a below follows after a numerical self - consistent iteration .",
    "the transition from the sm phase to the cdw is second order , whereas all other transitions are first order .",
    "we observe that , within the present model with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the stripe instability completely wipes out the qah and the dimerized phases expected to occur at finite @xmath5 . in order to suppress the stripe phase we include a further term in the hamiltonian above , namely a @xmath60 term for nnnn interactions",
    ". such term will generically be present in any system that can support nn and nnn interactions .",
    "to simplify matters we shall ignore any contribution to the kinetic energy generated by @xmath6 and focus on the frustration it generates for the stripe instability .",
    "we find that for @xmath6 non - zero both the qah and the dimerized phases are stabilized ( fig .",

    "we may also write @xmath74 where @xmath75 parametrizes the most general kekul distortion .",

    "( [ hh ] ) by noticing that @xmath95 is block - diagonal with two @xmath96 blocks on the diagonal .",
    "unfortunately , the eigenvalues obtained as roots of the associated cubic secular equations are given by lengthy and complicated expressions , which do not lend themselves to a convenient analysis .",

    "we observe that in addition to the cdw and qah phases identified previously@xcite a large portion of the phase diagram is occupied by the kekul phase .",
    "although the critical lines in the phase diagram are determined numerically , the critical couplings for the cdw at @xmath103 and for qah at @xmath104 can be found exactly from the corresponding gap equations for the model excluding kekul order .",
    "these read @xmath105 where the @xmath106 correspond to the set of nnn vectors for either of the triangular sublattices inside a single plaquette .",
    "if we wish to express critical couplings in terms of the bare hopping amplitude @xmath16 we must include the mf equation for the hopping renormalization @xmath107 we thus obtain @xmath108 and @xmath109 , in good agreement with the numerical results of fig .",
    "our value of @xmath110 also agrees with ref .  , but our @xmath111 is smaller by a factor of about 1.5 when expressed in terms of @xmath16 and about a factor of 2 in terms @xmath112 .",
    "we do not know what is the reason for this discrepancy .",
    "since the critical couplings quoted above agree with our numerically determined phase diagram , we are confident that these are correct within the definitions employed in this study .",
    "in a superconductor or a superfluid the order parameter has a global u(1 ) symmetry related to its complex phase .",
    "this means that , even on a lattice , a u(1 ) vortex is a legitimate topological defect . in the kekul ( dimerized )",
    "phase the order parameter exhibits a global z@xmath1 ( z@xmath3 ) symmetry leading to the possibility of a z@xmath1 ( z@xmath3 ) vortex , which can be pictured as a point where the corresponding 3 ( 4 ) domains meet .",
    "since the domain walls cost an energy per unit length , the energy of a single isolated z@xmath113 vortex diverges linearly with the system size and , equivalently , a vortex - antivortex pair experiences linear confinement .",
    "u(1 ) vortices , on the other hand , experience only logarithmic confinement .",
    "this has important consequences for the appearance of vortices in these systems .",
    "u(1 ) vortices can thermally unbind above the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath114 while z@xmath113 vortices remain confined at all temperatures .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that the z@xmath113 vortices in the kekul / dimerized phase can nevertheless be observed since at short length scales they resemble u(1 ) vortices , and thus , for relatively short intervortex separations , interact only logarithmically .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the energy cost of a domain wall is relatively small . at length scales exceeding the confinement length @xmath115",
    ", vortices remain linearly confined , as dictated by symmetry .",
    "if @xmath115 is sufficiently long compared to the vortex core size @xmath116 , however , then the zero mode and the fractional charge associated with an individual vortex could be observed experimentally . to address this issue",
    "quantitatively we now carry out a fully self - consistent calculation of a vortex in the dimerized phase on the @xmath0-flux lattice .",
    "our calculations show that , indeed , at short length scales , a vortex in the dimer order parameter resembles a u(1 ) vortex while on longer length scales clear domains separated by domain walls emerge .    within our region of parameter space on the square lattice having a stable dimerized phase",
    ", we set up a discretized version of a u(1 ) vortex in the dimerization pattern @xmath117 as described in ref .  .",

    "( [ h1 ] ) , reflecting the strong on - site coulomb repulsion between electrons of opposite spin .",
    "it is well - known that for a bi - partite lattice , a large @xmath155 favors the antiferromagnetic sdw state .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram for spinful electrons on the honeycomb lattice in the @xmath155-@xmath4-@xmath5 space has been mapped out in ref .  .",
    "for small values of @xmath155 the phase diagram resembles that shown in fig .",
    "[ pdc ] except that the qah phase is replaced by the qsh phase .",
    "the two are degenerate at the mean field level but quantum fluctuations favor the latter .",
    "a question that we would like to answer is how the @xmath155-@xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram on the honeycomb lattice is affected by the presence of the kekul phase , which was not considered in ref .  .",
    "is there a region in the parameter space where a ` spin kekul ' phase is stabilized ? the latter represents a spinful version of the ordinary kekul phase and its order parameter is defined as follows .",
    "the nearest neighbor interactions in @xmath21 can be re - written using the identity @xmath156 , where @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in a mean field picture ,",
    "then , @xmath160 corresponds to the standard kekul phase and @xmath161 describes the spinful version .",
    "we find , however , that the spin kekul phase is not a mean field ground state of our hamiltonian . instead , a state in which two projections of the spin form the ordinary kekul phase is favored .",
    "this can be seen from the following symmetry based argument .",
    "we focus on the @xmath162 state and put the spin up into the ordinary kekul phase with parameters @xmath163 that minimize its ground state energy .",
    "the spin down electrons must then go into the kekul phase with parameters @xmath164 due to the @xmath165 in the order parameter .",
    "however , this is not a ground state for spin down electrons , meaning that the overall energy must be higher than the @xmath166 state .",
    "thus the energy of the sk phase is not exactly degenerate with the standard kekul phase as is the case for the qah / qsh spectrum , but instead has a small splitting with the kekul phase being favored as the ground state .",
    "so , in absence of some type of interaction that could favor the sk phases , our current hamiltonian is not capable of producing this potentially interesting phase .",
    "our studies show that interacting fermions moving on the honeycomb and @xmath0-flux square lattices can form a stable kekul phase , in addition to the previously identified cdw , sdw , and qah / qsh phases .",
    "two questions naturally arise : can the kekul phase be stabilized in a realistic system and if so , how can it be experimentally observed ?",
    "inspection of the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 reveals that the prospects of observing the kekul ( dimerized ) phase on the square lattice are not very good . when the nnn interaction is sufficiently strong to suppress the cdw , one obtains the stripe phase .",
    "even when this is suppressed by introduction of nnnn repulsion , the dimerized phase appears only at strong coupling ( @xmath167 ) and only in a small sliver of the parameter space .",
    "we thus conclude that although the square lattice is very convenient from the point of view of theoretical considerations , it is an unlikely candidate for the experimental observation of the kekul / dimerized phase .",
    "prospects for the kekul phase appear much better on the honeycomb lattice as it occupies a large portion of the @xmath4-@xmath5 mean field phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "the kekul phase should appear whenever the interaction strength becomes large and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are comparable . in natural graphene",
    "the coulomb interaction is strong but evidently not strong enough to open up a gap at the dirac point,@xcite at least when a sample is placed on a substrate such as sio@xmath168 .",
    "it has been suggested recently , on the basis of large scale monte carlo simulations , that graphene freely suspended _ in vacuum _ could become an insulator when the coulomb interaction between electrons is accounted for.@xcite the difference between the substrate and vacuum arises from the dielectric constant , which weakens the coulomb interaction in the vicinity of a polarizable solid such as sio@xmath168 , and also because of disorder induced by the substrate .",
    "although ref .   focused on the cdw instability , one may argue based on our present mean field study that the kekul phase is a more likely candidate for an instability induced by the coulomb interaction . in a very crude estimate the ratio @xmath169 should be equal to the ratio between the nn and nnn bond lengths , i.e.  @xmath170 . as illustrated in fig .  3",
    ", this ratio of @xmath169 clearly favors the kekul phase over cdw if the overall effective interaction strength is strong enough to open up a gap .",
    "recent experimental observation of the fractional quantum hall effect in suspended graphene@xcite confirms the increased importance of interactions over graphene on a substrate , where the fractional quantum hall effect thus far eluded experimental detection . at zero field , however , even the suspended samples appear semi - metallic@xcite down to 1.2k , suggesting that coulomb interactions are still too weak to open up a significant gap .",
    "we note , finally , that the kekul phase has been proposed to emerge as the leading instability of graphene in an applied magnetic field.@xcite also , a phase analogous to the kekul phase in graphene has been proposed to exist for electrons on the kagome lattice at 1/3 filling.@xcite    the kekul phase has broken translational symmetry characterized by a wavevector connecting the two inequivalent dirac points in the graphene spectrum . the on - site charge density remains uniform and this limits the spectrum of experimental probes capable of detecting this pattern of symmetry breaking . here we propose to use the technique of fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ft - sts ) that has already been applied to graphene.@xcite with sufficient resolution , ft - sts allows the mapping out of fine details of quasiparticle interference patterns at non - zero momenta , and , with help from the theoretical modeling of such patterns,@xcite it should be possible to establish the existence of the kekul or other symmetry breaking phases .    _",

    "<S> we also find various stripe phases , which do not occur on the honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the kekul phase is described by a z@xmath1 order parameter whose singly quantized vortices carry fractional charge @xmath2 . on the @xmath0-flux lattice </S>",
    "<S> the analogous dimerized phase is described by a z@xmath3 order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a fully self - consistent calculation of the vortex structure inside the dimerized phase and find that close to the core the vortex resembles a familiar superconducting u(1 ) vortex , but at longer length scales a clear z@xmath3 structure emerges with domain walls along the lattice diagonals . </S>"
