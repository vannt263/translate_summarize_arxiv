    "[ sec.1 ]      perhaps the most important distinction in the temporal evolution of a dynamical system is between persistent ( asymptotic ) and transient ( finite - time ) dynamics .",
    "dynamical systems theory reflects this division and has developed specialized methods and tools to investigate persistent ( e.g. , strange attractors , asymptotic lyapunov exponents ) and transient ( e.g. , chaotic saddle , escape rates ) chaotic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "these two approaches become connected when considering the effect of opening up a hole ( or introducing a leak ) in an otherwise closed chaotic system , converting by this persistent into transient chaos .",
    "transient and persistent dynamics appear in both conservative and dissipative systems , and it is important to distinguish leakage ( escape or removal of trajectories ) from dissipation ( contraction in the phase space ) . introducing a leak never generates an extra phase - space contraction and , e.g. , a conservative system remains conservative after becoming leaky .",
    "more than a tool to investigate the relationship between different theories , problems described by a closed chaotic system with a leak appear nowadays in a great variety of fields :    * * room acoustics : * the decay of the sound energy characterized traditionally by the so - called reverberation time can be considered a consequence of leaks : openings and absorbing surfaces on the room s boundary  @xcite .",
    "absorbing surfaces provide examples of partial leaks . *",
    "* chemical reactions * : unimolecular decay of excited chemical species have been modeled as an escape from a ( chaotic ) reactant region through a leak  @xcite . * * hydrodynamical flows and environmental sciences : * the fact that certain regions of flows have special hydrodynamical features and might therefore change the properties of particles advected into these regions can be described by the so - called resetting mechanism  @xcite , which is a kind of leak from the point of view of chaotic advection  @xcite . *",
    "* planetary science and cosmology : * the ( inelastic ) collision of a small body with larger planetary objects leads to a drastic change in its dynamics compared to that in a point mass approximation of the larger bodies . in a first approximation",
    "the problem can be treated as a loss due to leaks  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas apply in cosmology  @xcite . * * optical microcavities : * light rays in dielectric materials are partially transmitted and reflected ( with the exception of regions where total internal reflection takes place ) .",
    "chaotic cavities can be constructed to provide a strong directionality of emission through such a partial leak , a requirement for laser  @xcite . *",
    "* plasma physics : * particles in magnetic confinement devices are lost through collisions with sensors , antennas , or the chambers wall itself .",
    "these regions therefore play the role of a leak  @xcite . * * wave and quantum signatures of open systems : * features related to that of a leaking classical dynamics appear in properties such as the ( fractal ) distribution of eigenstates  @xcite , the survival probability in simulations and experiments  @xcite , and in the fractal weyl s law  @xcite .    in dynamical - systems",
    "theory , the idea of leaking an otherwise closed chaotic systems was first proposed by pianigiani and yorke as early as 1979 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ picture an energy conserving billiard table with smooth obstacles so that all trajectories are unstable with respect to the initial data .",
    "now suppose a small hole is cut in the table so that the ball can fall through .",
    "we would like to investigate the statistical behavior of such phenomena _",

    "the leakage procedure was therefore a tool to create transiently chaotic systems .",
    "interestingly , the development of the theory of transient chaos happened not to follow this line over decades .",
    "the importance of this mathematical approach becomes apparent when one realizes the multitude of situations in which the leak region has a well - defined physical interpretation .",
    "this aspect was first emphasized by smilansky and coworkers , who pointed out that any measurement ( both classical and quantum ) leads unavoidably to a leakage of the system .",
    "they wrote in 1992 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a discrete spectrum is a property of a closed system .",
    "however , the process of measuring the spectrum of a bounded system consists of coupling the system to an external continuum .",
    "thus , for the purpose of measurement , the closed system is turned into a scattering system _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    physical realizations of the leak can thus be either the effect of measurement devices or intrinsic properties of the system , such as , e.g. , absorbing boundaries .",
    "apart from physical leaks , there are also different _ theoretical _ motivations for considering leaking systems :    * leakage is a tool to understand the dynamics of closed systems , providing thus a sort of _ chaotic spectroscopy _  @xcite . more generally , systems with leaks help monitoring or _ peeping at _ chaos  @xcite [ see also @xcite ] . in this context , as in  @xcite , billiards with leaks were the first systems investigated because they allow a natural connection between the classical and quantum pictures  @xcite . *",
    "leaking systems have been explored in the context of synchronization of chaotic oscillators  @xcite , and of the control of chaos  @xcite .",
    "* leakage reveals the foliations inside the closed system  @xcite that lead , e.g. , to fractal exit boundaries  @xcite . *",
    "the distribution of poincar recurrences , which is commonly used to quantify properties of closed hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite , is equivalent to the survival probability in the same system with a leak  @xcite . *",
    "several quantifications of wave or quantum chaos , such as loschmidt echo  @xcite or fidelity decay  @xcite , can be realized physically in configurations that are analogous to introducing a localized leak in a closed system  @xcite .",
    "the common feature in all applications and theoretical procedures listed above is that one has some freedom when choosing the opening , i.e. the leak in a well - defined closed chaotic system  @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted to genuinely open systems in which the openness is intrinsic , and only slight parametric changes are physically realistic , which typically do not allow to go to the closed - system limit .",
    "although both classes of systems are dynamically open , of our aims is to emphasize the benefits of considering leaking systems , which are more precisely defined by two key elements :    * the existence of a well - defined closed system which can be used as a comparison ; * the possibility of controlling ( some ) properties of the leak such as position , size , shape , or reflectivity .",
    "property ( i ) guarantees that one can compare transient and asymptotic dynamics and can be considered as a particular case of ( ii ) if the possibility of reducing the leak size to zero is assured .",
    "leaking systems can be both dissipative and conservative ( hamiltonian ) . within this latter category ,",
    "we consider the problem of chaotic scattering [ as typically defined , e.g. , @xcite ] to be beyond the scope of this review because it lacks properties ( i ) and ( ii ) above    our main approach in this review article is based on transient chaos theory , which is applied to the case of leaky systems and connected to different recent applications .",
    "our aim is to be understandable by nonspecialists interested in learning what the implications of dynamical - systems theories are to specific applications . at the same time , we emphasize how specific applications pose new questions to the theory .",
    "thus , we devote special attention to developing a theory consistent with the following two aspects required by different applications :    * leaks are not necessarily full holes , they might be `` semipermeable '' , i.e , the energy content of trajectories entering a leak is partially transmitted and partially reflected . in such cases the leak is called a _ partial _ leak . *",
    "discrete - time maps of open flows might lead to a loss of information over the temporal properties , and therefore it is essential to use the generalized concept of _ true - time maps _",

[ sec.appendices ] ) we discuss some important but technical aspects of open billiards ( like e.g. , different types of measures and algorithms ) .      historically , perhaps the first problem involving systems with leaks was one related to the kinetic theory of gases .",
    "consider a container filled with ideal gas .",
    "how is the container emptied after a _ small _ leak @xmath0 is introduced on its boundary ?    the answer can be obtained from an elementary application of the kinetic theory . here",
    "we follow basically the treatment of @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a disk of area @xmath1 on the surface of the container and @xmath2 be the phase - space density of the particles , for which @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of particles in the container of volume @xmath5 at time @xmath6 .",
    "the number of particles with velocity @xmath7 leaving the system over a short time interval @xmath8 is then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the normal vector of the surface at the leak @xmath0 .",
    "the total number is then obtained by carrying out an integration over all velocities . thus , the time derivative of the number @xmath4 of particles inside the container is @xmath11 where the minus sign indicates that particles are escaping .    _",
    "molecular chaos _",
    ", a basic ingredient of kinetic theory , implies that an _ equilibrium _ phase - space density exists . in our problem",
    "it is _ homogeneous _",
    "( location independent ) and _ isotropic _ : all velocity directions are equally probable . in the limit of small  @xmath12",
    "we can expect that there is a quasi - equilibrium distribution @xmath13 in the open system which sets in on a time scale shorter than the average lifetime .",
    "this quasi - equilibrium distribution shares the properties of that of closed systems . in this case ,",
    "isotropy guarantees that the phase - space density depends only on the modulus @xmath14 of the velocity , and it is , therefore , convenient to use spherical coordinates for the integration . with @xmath15 being the angle between velocity and the normal vector , @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ eq.dndt1 ] ) reads as @xmath17 the spherical symmetry of the phase space density applied to ( [ eq.f ] ) leads to @xmath18 and implies that @xmath19 is the probability density for the velocity modulus @xmath14 in the gas .",
    "substituting this into ( [ dn ] ) , the first integral is found to be proportional to the average @xmath20 of the velocity modulus . by carrying out all integrals , we find @xmath21 as long as @xmath20 is independent of time . here",
    "we are interested in systems with constant  @xmath14 .",
    "the exponential decay is then valid for any @xmath22 . ]",
    "the decay of the particle number is thus exponential , of the form of @xmath23 , with an _ escape rate _",
    "@xmath24 for simplicity we focus here on an ensemble of identical particles with the _ same _ velocity  @xmath14 colliding elastically , in which case  @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.kappav ] ) .",
    "the reciprocal of the escape rate , which turns out to be the average lifetime , can then be written as @xmath26 this is the time needed for the decay of the survivors by a factor of @xmath27 . since the result is linear in @xmath12 , and",
    "the velocity distribution is not only isotropic but also homogeneous , i.e. independent of the position along the wall , the expression remains valid for _ small _ leaks @xmath0 of _ any _ shape , and @xmath12 is then the total leaking area . since @xmath12 is small , @xmath28 is large , and hence the assumption of a quasi - equilibrium distribution becomes justified a posteriori .",
    "an interesting , historically independent development is sabine s law , a central object of architectural acoustics .",
    "this law says that the residual sound intensity in a room decays exponentially with time @xcite .",
    "the duration to decay below the audible intensity is called the reverberation time , @xmath29 , and was found experimentally by w. c. sabine in 1898 to be @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the sound velocity , and @xmath12 is the area of the union of all openings of the room ( or of all energy absorbing surfaces after proper normalization ) . with @xmath32",
    "m@xmath33s , the numerical value of @xmath29 in si units is @xmath34 .",
    "sabine s experiments also showed that the reverberation time for a pleasant sound perception is on the order of a few seconds for a good auditorium , and he designed concert halls ( like , e.g. , the boston music hall ) according to this principle .",
    "a comparison of ( [ tau ] ) and ( [ t ] ) reveals that sabine s law is nothing but an application of the exponential decay of the particle number evaluated with @xmath35 as the particle velocity .",
    "what is escaping in this problem is however not particles , but the energy of the sound waves . in the geometrical limit of room acoustics",
    ", one can consider the decay of energy as the problem of particles which travel along sound rays and lose part of their energy upon hitting the leak or the absorbing surface .",
    "the most remarkable property of eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) is its universality : the reverberation time is _ independent _ of the location of the sound source and of the shape of the room , provided the absorption is weak and sound disperses uniformly around the room e.g. , due to roughness or irregular geometry of the walls  @xcite .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) results from the fact that in the acoustic context the decay below the audible intensity implies @xmath37 db , i.e. , a decay factor of @xmath38 , instead of a factor of @xmath27 in ( [ t ] ) .",
    "law  ( [ t ] ) , dated back to 1898 , appears thus to be the first application of leaking chaotic dynamical systems in the history of science !",
    "we now take a closer look at the assumptions in the derivations above from the perspective of the dynamics . in terms of the modern theory of dynamical systems ,",
    "the isotropy and homogeneity of the velocity distribution are a consequence of the following two hypotheses :    * the leak size is _ small _ , so that the phase - space distribution does not change due to the openness ; and * the particle dynamics inside the room is _ chaotic _ , more technically , the dynamics is _ ergodic and strongly mixing _",
    "( implying exponential decay of correlations in time ) .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the exponential decay is valid also in other dimensions .",
    "for instance , the escape rate in two - dimensional billiards is then found to be @xmath39 where @xmath12 is the length of the leak along the perimeter , and @xmath5 is the two - dimensional volume , the area , of the billiard table .",
    "the replacement of factor @xmath40 by @xmath41 is due to the geometrical change from spherical to planar polar coordinates .    it should be noted that in both cases the survival probability @xmath42 up to time @xmath6 is @xmath43 as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq.dndt2 ] ) , with initial condition  @xmath44 .",
    "the probability @xmath45 to leave around the escape time @xmath46 is the negative derivative of  @xmath42 and thus @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since the exponential decay holds from the very beginning , the average lifetime @xmath49 is found to be @xmath50 , which was used in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) .",
    "the symbol  @xmath51 can be interpreted as an ensemble average .",
    "finally , it is instructive to write both expressions  ( [ eq.kappav ] ) and  ( [ eq.kappa2d ] ) of the escape rate as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the relative size of the leak compared to the full wall surface , and can therefore be considered as the _ measure _ of the leak ( taken with respect to the lebesgue measure ) .",
    "the denominator has the dimension of time and is given by @xmath54 in the three- and two - dimensional case , respectively .",
    "these  @xmath55 s turn out to be the precise expressions of the _ average collision time _ between collisions with the wall ( or , after a multiplication by @xmath14 , the mean - free - path ) , well known for three- and two - dimensional _ closed _ rooms or billiards . as emphasized by  @xcite",
    ", these results were obtained already in the late xix century by czuber and clausius .",
    "it is the average collision time that sets the characteristic time with which the average lifetime should be compared : for small leaks @xmath56 , i.e. the time scales strongly separate .    by definition , @xmath55 can be expressed as the average over the local collision times @xmath57 for the phase - space coordinates @xmath58 along the wall as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the uniform phase space ( lebesgue ) measure characteristic of conservative systems .",
    "all equations found are taken with respect to the distributions characteristic of the _ unperturbed _ system .",
    "this is consistent with the small leak assumption ( * h1 * above ) so that the escape rates obtained can be considered as a leading order result in a perturbation expansion where averages can yet be taken with respect to distributions characterizing the unperturbed ( closed ) system .    in the modern applications mentioned in sec .",
    "[ ssec.motiv ] , however , conditions * h1 * ( small leaks ) and * h2 * ( strong chaos ) are typically not met . here",
    "we discuss in detail what happens in such cases .",
    "for instance , in any practical application the leak size is not , or can not be made , infinitesimally small so that * h1 * is violated and perturbation expansions break down .",
    "we shall see that an exponential decay of the survival probability typically remains valid for finite leak sizes , at least after some initial period .",
    "the estimation of the escape rate can be greatly improved by considering a similar expression as in eq .",
    "( [ eq.mut ] ) , the measure of the leak divided by the average collision time , however , both taken with respect to a _",
    "different _ measure : @xmath61 the new relevant measure  @xmath62 differs from the original lebesgue measure  @xmath60 since many particles have left the system by the time of observation , and what counts is the set of long - lived particles . with finite leaks ,",

    "the dimension of the full ( four - dimensional ) phase space is reduced by two ( using momentum conservation and the condition of collision ) . the shape of the billiard s boundary uniquely defines the dynamics of the particles , and system - specific properties depend sensitively on this shape .",

    "a true - time map is equivalent to the continuous - time representation , but leads to faster and more reliable results than a direct integration of the billiard flow .",

    "<S> there are numerous physical situations in which a hole or leak is introduced in an otherwise closed chaotic system . </S>",
    "<S> the leak can have a natural origin , it can mimic measurement devices , and it can also be used to reveal dynamical properties of the closed system . a unified treatment of leaking systems is provided and applications to different physical problems , both in the classical and quantum pictures , are reviewed . the treatment is based on the transient chaos theory of open systems , which is essential because real leaks have finite size and therefore estimations based on the closed system differ essentially from observations . </S>",
    "<S> the field of applications reviewed is very broad , ranging from planetary astronomy and hydrodynamical flows , to plasma physics and quantum fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is expanded and adapted to the case of partial leaks ( partial absorption and/or transmission ) with applications to room acoustics and optical microcavities in mind . </S>",
