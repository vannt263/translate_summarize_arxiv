    "a large portion of experiments using vuv radiation are presently carried out at synchrotron radiation facilities and vuv sase fels .",
    "a high - resolution vuv monochromator is an important element of such facilities .",
    "photo - absorption spectra of helium are often used for calibration of these monochromators .",
    "in fact , as is well - known , the transmittance spectrum in the helium gas exhibits narrow - bandwidth absorbing resonances down to a few mev , which follow the fano profile @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a novel method for spectral filtering based on a remarkable feature of the fano interference phenomenon for helium .",
    "in particular , within the photon energy range between @xmath0 ev and @xmath1 ev , the correlation index of the fano profile for the photo - ionization spectra in helium is equal to unity , meaning that the minimum of the cross - section is strictly zero @xcite .",
    "we suggest the exploitation of this feature for filtering purposes , using a windowless gas - filled cell equipped with differential pumping .",
    "in fact , for a sufficiently large column density , the spectrum of the incoming radiation will be attenuated by the background cross section of many orders of magnitude , except for those wavelength near the point where the cross - section is zero . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on physics issues .",
    "the design features of a gas monochromator system based on this principle should not differ too much from the gas attenuator systems at xfels @xcite .    a remarkable advantage of gas monochromators based on the above principle is simplicity .",
    "in fact , such a device would use no optical components , and therefore there are no problem with alignment , heat loading and beam wavefront perturbations .",
    "moreover , the peak efficiency of a gas monochromator would be close to @xmath5 .",
    "also , a very narrow bandwidth would be granted .",
    "such a device , installed at any vuv sase fel facility would enable the delivery of single - mode vuv laser beam . in this case ,",
    "the shapes of the single - shot spectra after the monochromator can be identified with the gas - cell transmittance calculated from the first principles , and do not depend on the detailed intensity distribution of modes of the incoming spectrum .",
    "we present a feasibility study and exemplifications for the flash sase fel in the vuv regime .",
    "the applicability of the gas monochromator setup is obviously not restricted to vuv sase fel facilities .",
    "synchrotron radiation facilities may benefit from this scheme as well .",
    "the output radiation pulses from sase fel exhibit poor longitudinal coherence .",
    "while a single - shot spectrum consists of many spikes , or modes , the average spectrum is constituted by a smooth distribution with a fwhm typically corresponding to about @xmath6 in the vuv wavelength range .",
    "the bandwidth of the vuv beam can be thus further reduced by using a gas monochromator . a schematic representation of the setup is shown in fig . [ gcell0 ] .",
    "each spike in the spectrum has an average width of about @xmath7 for wavelengths around @xmath8 nm , and is thus larger than the bandwidth of the gas monochromator , which allows for a few mev bandwidth .",
    "this fact enables the delivery of single - mode vuv laser beams .",
    "the shape of the single shot spectra after the gas monochromator can be described in terms of the transmittance of the gas cell , and do not depend on the details of the intensity distribution of the spikes in the incoming spectrum .",
    "it is therefore possible to properly define amplitude and phase for a single - shot spectrum after the monochromator and , hence the single - shot radiation pulse shape in the time domain .",
    "the working principle of the gas monochromator is based on the characteristic of the photo - absorption cross - sections for helium at energies below the second ionization threshold . in general",
    ", the interaction with a soft x - ray electromagnetic pulse has an ionizing effect for the atom . a first ionization threshold , where the remaining electron in the ion is found in the state with principal quantum number @xmath9 , is found at @xmath10 ev , while a second ionization threshold with @xmath11 is found at @xmath12 ev .",
    "therefore , after interaction with a photon with energy between these two thresholds , one finds the helium ion in the ground state @xmath13 , and a free electron with kinetic energy equal to the photon energy diminished of @xmath10 ev .",
    "this single open channel can be reached either directly or via decay of a doubly excited state , the well - known autoionizing state @xcite . in this case",
    "only one channel is open in the continuum , meaning that the final state is the helium ion in the ground state .",
    "the two paths towards this channels interfere and one is left with fano lines obeying :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the background cross - section , @xmath16 is known as the asymmetry index , while the reduced energy @xmath17 is defined as    @xmath18    @xmath19 being the energy of the resonance , with a width @xmath20 .",
    "when the energy increases , or one considers other gases , new channels open up .",
    "for example , above the second ionization threshold for helium , when the photon energy increases between @xmath12 ev to @xmath21 ev , a second channel is present , characterized by the helium ion with the bound electron with @xmath11 ( @xmath22 state ) , and free electron energy equal to the photon energy diminished by @xmath12 ev . in this photon energy range",
    "we have a set of autoionizing resonances , which interfere with two open channels ( @xmath13 or @xmath22 ) .",
    "more in general , as the photon energy increases below the double ionization threshold at @xmath23 ev , other channels corresponding to the helium ion with higher numbers of @xmath24 ( @xmath24th ionization threshold ) can be reached .",
    "then , as explained for example in @xcite , transitions to the continuum may or may not interact with the discrete autoionization state , and the expression for the cross - section has to be modified as :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the background cross - sections of the interacting and non - interacting transitions to the continuum . defining the total cross - section @xmath28 , which one would measure without autoionization , eq .",
    "( [ sigsig2 ] ) can be cast in the form    @xmath29    where the correlation coefficient @xmath30 is introduced as    @xmath31    eq .",
    "( [ sigsig3 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ sigsig2 ] ) for @xmath32 , corresponding to the helium resonances under study . in this case",
    ", there is always one energy value around the resonance , at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . around that energy value",
    ", radiation can pass through the gas cell almost without attenuation .",
    "in fact , the photoabsorption cross section @xmath35 is linked to the light attenuation through a gas medium of column density @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the length of the cell and @xmath38 the gas density , via the beer - lambert law :    @xmath39~ , \\label{beerl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the incident intensity , and @xmath41 is the attenuated intensity of the transmitted light at frequency @xmath42 . by inspecting eq .",
    "( [ beerl ] ) it can be seen that when the column density is increased radiation is attenuated at all frequencies except at @xmath33 . as a result , in the case of the helium gas , and for energies below the second ionization threshold an increase in the gas density",
    "transforms the gas cell into a bandpass filter .",
    "let us then consider the series of autoionizing resonances converging to the @xmath43 level of the helium ion , corresponding @xmath44 rydberg series , all converging to the second ionization threshold , corresponding to @xmath12 ev .",
    "these three series all begin with the two helium electrons characterized by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which corresponds to an energy of @xmath0 ev .",
    "there are three possible choices for the @xmath47 quantum numbers : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "however , the levels of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 wave functions are nearly degenerate , and the doubly - excited states are better described in terms of constructive and destructive superpositions of these wave functions , finally yielding the three rydberg series : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath50 . since these three series converge ( but do not reach ) the second ionization threshold , all the correspondent doubly excited states @xmath53 decay to an helium ion in the ground state . out of these three series ,",
    "only the first @xmath54 will be of interest to us , as the others are too weak .",
    "the energy - dependent background cross - section expressed in megabarn ( @xmath55 ) is given by @xcite    @xmath56    with @xmath57 the radiation wavelength in angstrom units . the asymmetry index @xmath16 , the energy of the resonances @xmath19 , and the resonance widths @xmath20 , have been the subject of several calculations .",
    "the cross - section for the series @xmath54 can be calculated using eq .",

    "as one can see , in this case the filter bandwidth is around @xmath63 mev fwhm , which is narrower , but in the same order of magnitude of the bandwidth of a single sase spike . as a result",

    "it should be noted that the theoretical calculations used to calculate the overall transmission function of the gas cell are based on the validity of the perturbation theory approach . in our case",

    "this means that a pulse contains about @xmath67 photons .",
    "the photon density is thus @xmath68 .",
    "it should be noted that the resonance line is about two orders of magnitude narrower(@xmath69 ) compared with the sase bandwidth ( @xmath70 ) , while the maximum cross section reaches about 10 mb . as a result",
    ", ionization takes place mainly due to the background cross section , of about 1.5 mb . recalling that 1 mb is @xmath71 one can confirm the validity of the perturbation theory approach used to calculate the overall transmission function of the gas cell .",
    "this reasoning is valid for a single radiation pulse .",
    "limitations for time diagram of facility operation can be estimated with the help of @xcite , where space - charge effects are studied , and an estimation of ambipolar diffusion is presented .",
    "based on this study we can estimate that the single bunch mode operation with a 10 hz repetition rate at flash will not be problematic , while for other facilities it should be possible to stretch this range up to about @xmath72 hz . however , considering , for example , the flash multi bunch mode of operation ( @xmath64 mhz rep rate within @xmath64 ms macro pulse , with @xmath58 hz macro pulse repetition rate ) further studies on the diffusion process in the gas cell are needed , which are left for future work .",
