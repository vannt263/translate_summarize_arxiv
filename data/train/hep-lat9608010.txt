    "convergent expansions such as linked cluster , hopping parameter or high temperature expansions provide an analytic alternative to monte carlo simulations .",
    "originally they have been developed in the infinite volume , meanwhile they have been extended to finite volumes as well @xcite .",
    "in contrast to generic perturbation theory , hopping parameter expansions ( hpes ) are convergent expansions about completely disordered lattice systems .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath5 is the coefficient of the ( pair ) interaction term .",
    "since we calculate free energies and connected correlations in the hopping parameter expansion , we generate linked cluster expansions ( lces ) .",
    "lces have been generalized to scalar field theories at _ finite _ temperature by @xcite .",
    "compared to the zero temperature results , the finite temperature induces a tiny shift in the critical temperature ( hopping parameter ) .",
    "thus one has to face a similar problem as the improvement of a bad signal to noise ratio in monte carlo simulations . here",
    "the signal corresponds to the finite temperature effect and the noise to the `` background '' of temperature zero graphs .",
    "the price to describe the critical region , in particular critical exponents , with an accurracy of @xmath6 % is to go to the 18th order in the expansion in @xmath5 .",
    "this accurracy has been achieved in @xcite .",
    "thus the question arises , why we are still interested in a generalization of lces to a finite volume .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "@xmath7 the first one is to identify 1st order transitions from series expansions in the high temperature phase .",
    "for example a measurement of a vanishing critical exponent @xmath8 is compatible with a gaussian fixed point , but not conclusive for the onset of a first order transition region at a tricritical point .",
    "( the latter interpretation actually applies to our measurements . )",
    "@xmath7 the second reason is to distinguish second order transitions associated with different universality classes .",
    "ideally critical exponents should show a clear gap between plateaus of different universality classes .",
    "practically the gap is smeared out because of the truncation of the series expansions at finite order .",
    "the truncation has a similar rounding effect on this gap as a finite volume on thermodynamic singularities .",
    "in hpes the action is split into a sum of ultralocal parts @xmath9 and a next neighbour part @xmath10 with next neighbour couplings @xmath11 .",
    "a taylor expansion in @xmath5 of the partition function @xmath12 about the ultralocal contribution to @xmath12 finally leads to graphical expansions of n - point susceptibilities @xmath13 [ exa.chi ] _ n ( ) = _ 0 a_^(n ) ^. the coefficients @xmath14 are a sum of graphs each of which consists of a product of the inverse symmetry factor , an internal symmetry factor , a lattice embedding factor , and a polynomial of vertex contributions depending on the couplings involved in @xmath9 .",
    "it is only the embedding factor that depends on the topology of the particular lattice , that will change in passing from an infinite to a finite volume .      from our series expansions we measure a _ shift in @xmath15 _ from a fit according to [ abc ] ( | _ c(l ) - _ c ( ) | ) - y_t .",
    "here @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 for 2nd order transitions and @xmath18 for 1st order transitions .",
    "the critical couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined as the radius of convergence of the series expansions in a finite or infinite volume , respectively . since",
    "an extrapolation of the scaling behaviour from the height and width of the critical region is not feasible within the series expansions , we have proposed the following _ monotony criterion_.      consider two volumes @xmath21 and @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 stands for a generic coupling , and @xmath26 for the reduced `` temperature '' .",
    "we define    [ fss.rml ] r(v_1,v_2 ) : = 1 - ,    the monotony criterion says that    @xmath27    the different behaviour of @xmath28 comes from the _ singular _ part of @xmath29 .",
    "the underlying observation is a different monotony behaviour of response functions @xmath30 for 1st and 2nd order transitions that is seen for @xmath30s with nonanalytic behaviour in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the @xmath30s are increasing in volume in a certain neighbourhood of @xmath31 for 2nd order transitions and decreasing for 1st order transitions . for a precise specification of the scaling region , i.e. the bounds that @xmath21 , @xmath22,@xmath32 have to satisfy , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the difference reflects the @xmath33-function and power law singularities for 1st or 2nd order transitions , respectively , predicted at @xmath34 in the thermodynamic limit.thus the actual behaviour of @xmath29 we have found in applications to scalar @xmath1 models ( cf .",
    "section 3 ) is neither a pecularity of the model nor an artifact of the series expansions .",
    "@xmath7 it should be noticed that the criterion is not restricted to series expansions , but also applicable to monte carlo calculations ( since both involved volumes may be finite ) if the regular contribution to @xmath30 is really negligible .",
    "@xmath7 it is neither restricted to order parameter susceptibilities as the notation suggests , but similarly applies to other response functions like the specific heat if they diverge in the thermodynamic limit .      the effective potential is defined via the effective action @xmath36 evaluated for a constant background field @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the 1pi - susceptibilities according to @xmath39 @xmath40 the @xmath41s are obtained from the @xmath42s if the graphical expansion of the @xmath42s is restricted to 1pi graphs .",
    "the ( non)convex shape of the effective potential in the symmetric phase indicates the order of the transition .",
    "its evaluation in a _",
    "finite _ volume leads to an alternative determination of @xmath19 via the coexistence of different minima of the free energy or a vanishing of the coefficient of the quadratic term .",
    "we apply the finite size scaling analysis with hpes to a scalar theory with @xmath45 and @xmath46-terms and @xmath1 symmetry in 3 dimensions , @xmath47 is chosen as @xmath48 and @xmath49 . after a suitable reparametrization the ultralocal part of the action reads [ exa.action ] ( , , ) = ^2 + ( ^2 - 1)^2 + ( ^2 - 1)^3 the hopping parameter term is given as               the value for @xmath50 for the first order transitions confirms results of @xcite for @xmath2 and extends results of @xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "it disagrees with the naive expectation of a scaling with @xmath0 rather than @xmath51 .",
    "the figure shows results for the monotony      criterion applied to the special case of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath3 , @xmath55 .",
    "the additional index @xmath37 refers to the order of truncation .",
    "a similar figure is obtained for @xmath56 as function of @xmath25 for fixed order of the truncation and varying volumes .",
    "thus the intersection of the curves with the @xmath25-axis , which localizes the tricritical point , weakly depends on the order of the truncation and the choice of @xmath21 .",
    "the ultimate determination of the tricritical couplings @xmath57 and @xmath58 needs an extrapolation in both parameters . respecting the mutual relation between the truncation effect and the finite volume dependence of the intersection , the final estimate for @xmath57 leads to @xmath59 . for further details on the involved extrapolations we refer to @xcite .",
    "this result improves the infinite volume estimate of @xmath60 by two orders of magnitude .",
    "it should be noticed that the volume independence of @xmath29 along the tricritical line supports the validity of a mean field analysis of tricritical exponents even in three dimensions as one might have expected from the ginzburg criterion .",
    "the localization of @xmath57 from the change in the shape of the effective potential leads to an upper bound on @xmath57 , we find @xmath61 , since the involved systematic errors are less well under control .",
    "an extension to _ effective _ scalar models for an underlying salam - weinberg theory with hpes in a finite volume will particularly well work in the range of large higgs masses .",
    "it complements the range of higgs masses which has been available in recent monte carlo simulations and allows a determination of the _ critical _ higgs mass above which the electroweak transition turns into a smooth crossover phenomenon @xcite ."
