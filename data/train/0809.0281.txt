    "in the paper  @xcite ( hereafter called ff1 ) , the authors investigated the consequences of the assumption that the high - transverse - momentum particles seen in hadron - hadron collisions are produced by a single , hard , large - angle elastic scattering of quarks , one from the target and one from the beam .",
    "the fast outgoing quarks were assumed to fragment into a cascade jet of hadrons .",
    "the distribution of quarks in the incoming hadrons were determined from lepton - hadron inelastic scattering data , together with certain theoretical constraints such as sum rules , etc .",
    "the manner in which quarks cascade into hadrons was determined from particle distributions seen in lepton - hadron and lepton - lepton collisions supplemented by theoretical arguments .",
    "parameterizations for single - hadron fragmentation functions ( sff ) were obtained . in the next work  @xcite a new , much simpler , parameterization for these functions was provided .",
    "the answers to many other questions concerning the details of the hadronization process were given .",
    "this hadronization model for the production of mesons in the jets of initial quarks and antiquarks turned out very successful and is used so far in the design of experiments in which quark jets may be observed and for comparison with the available experimental data .",
    "it provides a parameterization of the properties of the jet of mesons generated by a fast outgoing quark .",
    "it is assumed that the meson that contains the original quark leaves momentum and flavor to a remaining jet in which the particles are distributed ( except for scaling of the energy and possible changes of flavor ) like those of the original jet .",
    "one function , the probability @xmath2 that the remaining jet has a fraction @xmath3 of the momentum of the original jet , is chosen ( as a parabola ) so the final distribution of charged hadrons agrees with data from lepton experiments .",
    "all the properties of quark jets are determined from @xmath2 and three parameters : a ) the degree that su(3 ) is broken in the formation of new quark - antiquark pairs ( @xmath4 is taken as half as likely as @xmath5 ) @xmath6 ( as usually , it is adopted the well - known condition following from the isospin symmetry @xmath7 ) and for the sum of probabilities it is taken @xmath8 , because the probabilities of the production of the heavier quarks are neglected ; b ) the spin nature of the primary mesons ( in the basic version of model is assumed to be vector and pseudoscalar with equal probability ) @xmath9 ; c ) the mean transverse momentum given to these primary mesons . in the rest of the paper we will frequently refer to the ref .",
    "@xcite and for this reason it is convenient to denote its as ff2 , and model , which was developed there to denote as field - feynman quark jet model ( ffqjm ) .",
    "+ we would like present here the explanation of the success of the ffqjm , which was given by gottschalk in his lectures  @xcite : `` specifically , the ffqjm is not a ' ' theory `` of how hadronization works . rather , it is simply a parameterization of hadron formation in jets which reproduces two important experimental facts : 1 ) approximate scaling of the energy distributions of hadrons within a jet ; 2 ) limited transverse momenta of the produced hadrons with respect to the jet axis .",
    "these qualitative features of hard scattering data are not ' ' explained `` or ' ' derived `` in the ffqjm .",
    "rather , the ffqjm is a parameterization of hadron production from fast quarks which is constructed in such a manner that the above experimental observations are reproduced . ''",
    "+ let us briefly discuss the parameters from points a ) and b ) of ffqjm presented above .",
    "they play important role in the understanding of the hadronization process . in the early model of field and feynman",
    "presented in ff1 , the point a ) coincides with that from ffqjm , but point b ) differs . for its in ff1 is chosen simple version @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in the simple lund model  @xcite , which has very large similarities with the ffqjm , the point a ) coincides with latter , but for parameters of point b ) the ratio is chosen in the form @xmath12 as given by statistical spin counting . in the later version of lund model ,",
    "the so called standard lund model  @xcite the point a ) is changed to @xmath13 which is followed from the tunneling production mechanism , but point b ) coincides with one from ffqjm , because authors state that the spin - spin forces enhance the production of the lighter pseudoscalars , from the naive @xmath14 vector to pseudoscalar ratio to something closer to @xmath15 .",
    "later these parameters were investigated in detail in the process of @xmath16 annihilation ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) . in",
    "@xcite it is shown that the production rates of light - flavor hadrons are set by their masses , spins , strangeness suppression , and strongly influenced by the spin - spin interactions of their quarks .",
    "the vector - to - pseudoscalar meson and decuplet - to - octet baryon suppresions are the same and are explained by the hyperfine mass splitting .",
    "the strangeness suppression factor , @xmath17 , is the same for mesons and baryons .",
    "it is related to the difference in the constituent quark masses , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , at the temperature , @xmath20 .",
    "comparison of the parameters from ffqjm with the ones obtained in other models showes that their values differ significantly .",
    "this means , that values of parameters in ffqjm were determined with large uncertainties .",
    "inclusion in consideration the new sets of experimental data and new observables can improve description and shift the parameters to their precise values .",
    "+ in ffqjm , using formalism based on the recursive principle and available experimental data , were obtained sff @xmath21 , which are the distributions of hadrons of flavor @xmath22 from a quark @xmath23 , which carry away the fraction @xmath24 of its energy , and dihadron fragmentation functions ( dff ) @xmath25 , which are the distributions of hadrons of flavors @xmath26 and @xmath27 from a quark @xmath23 , which carry away the fractions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of its energy , respectively . using these results , authors proposed several experiments , which can verify model . among others",
    ", they proposed to measure the correlation functions for oppositely and identically charged hadrons .",
    "it was predicted , that correlation function for the oppositely charged hadrons must show the characteristic short - range correlation behavior .",
    "the correlation between two identically charged hadrons , on the other hand , was predicted to be quite small . in ff2",
    "the correlation function of two hadrons was presented as a function of their `` @xmath24 rapidity '' given by @xmath28 .",
    "were considered energies large enough that a plateau was developed .",
    "rapidity of the first hadron was fixed in region of plateau , @xmath29 ( which corresponds @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 was changed in wide region @xmath32 . as it is well known , in this model energy and momentum of the quark jets do not precisely conserved .",
    "the violation of the energy conservation reaches a few per cents . in these conditions",
    "the consideration of hadrons with small enough energy may be doubtful .",
    "+ in this work we study the correlation function in the framework of ffqjm in detail , for the one definite reaction , the semi - inclusive electroproduction of hadrons on proton in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) region , at moderate energies ( energy of the virtual photon or , which is the same , the energy of the initial quark in order of 10 - 20 gev ) , where the plateau does not formed and where the small values of @xmath24 in order of @xmath33 do not belong to the current fragmentation region . instead of pairs of oppositely and identically charged hadrons we consider pairs of hadrons having definite charge and flavor ; and instead of rapidity , which has very narrow changing region at moderate energies , we use variable @xmath24 . it is shown that the correlation function has interesting properties .",
    "in particular for some pairs of hadrons there are kinematic regions over variable @xmath1 ( at fixed values of @xmath0 ) where it is positive and unexpectedly large . the experimental investigation of the correlation function in these kinematic regions",
    "has twofold interest , from one side it can help to investigate some delicate properties of quark jets and from the other side can help to verify the physical suppositions of model , and to obtain more precise values of parameters .",
    "+ there are , of course , several obvious defects of the model , which were discussed by various people begun with authors of model , field and feynman . the detailed criticism of model can be found in work  @xcite .",
    "there are , also , many attempts to improve the model for the more precise description of the experimental data ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "+ however , despite on the available defects , the model is able to describe the experimental data in dis region with good enough precision , as the numerous applications are shown . therefore , we think that it can be used for the qualitative study of the two hadron correlation functions at moderate energies . + and last point , which we would like to discuss here , is the place of this work among others , devoted to the investigation of the dff .",
    "at present , many questions connected with the hadron - hadron correlation become the objects of the experimental investigations in the high - energy lepton - lepton , lepton - hadron , lepton - nucleus ,",
    "hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions . as a consequence",
    "are arisen theoretical works , which devoted to the explanation and description of the existing experimental data or to the proposals for future experiments .",
    "there is huge amount of such experimental and theoretical works .",
    "naturally it is impossible to present them in one article .",
    "we present only two of them , because they reflect common approach to the investigation of dff on phenomenological level .",
    "they are refs .",
    "@xcite , and  @xcite . in these works",
    "authors had concentrated on the definition of the dff and derived the dglap evolution equations for the non - singlet quark dff  @xcite and singlet quark and gluon dff  @xcite . the more attention was paid to the derivation of dglap evolution equations and less to the derivation of proper initial conditions .",
    "about initial conditions used in  @xcite , authors themselves note , that in numerical study of the nonsinglet quark dff they used a simple ansatz for the initial condition as @xmath34 , which at best is just a guess and differs significantly from the inherent hadron correlations in a single jet . in the next work",
    "@xcite the initial conditions for the dff were extracted from jetset at a scale @xmath35 .",
    "although both the sff and dff evolve rapidly with @xmath36 , their ratio , which frequently is used for the comparison with experimental data , has a very weak @xmath36 dependence .",
    "this is especially true for the ratio in the case of the gluon fragmentation function , which shows practically no change with @xmath36 .",
    "the results of evolution are strongly dependent , however , on the initial conditions and thus on the actual values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this work",
    "we study the dis at moderate energies and @xmath36 , i.e. we investigate initial conditions for dff for different pairs of hadrons and different values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we show , that different choice of the types of hadrons and their fractional energies leads to the essentially different initial conditions for dff .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss the structure of ffqjm and point out the way of the derivation of the formulae for the calculations of sff and dff , and present expression for correlation function .",
    "section 3 presents results and discussion .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "let us consider the semi - inclusive dis process on proton , in which a two hadron system is observed in the final state : @xmath37 we would like to study correlation between two hadrons in the framework of the ffqjm .",
    "before we want briefly remind , that main ingredients of ffqjm are the probability function @xmath38 and three free parameters : 1 ) the ratio @xmath39 ; 2 ) the probability of pseudoscalar meson production @xmath40 and 3 ) the mean transverse momentum of the primary mesons . as we already mentioned in introduction , we do not consider third parameter and suppose that integration over it is performed .",
    "it is easily to see , that parameters from points 1 and 2 are correlated with parameter @xmath41 entering in function @xmath2 . in ffqjm",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is fixed on value @xmath42 , the choice of parameter @xmath43 and correlated with it parameter @xmath41 leads to the two sets of parameters ( two versions of model ) considered in ff2 .",
    "they are : a ) simple version , which takes into account the direct production of pseudoscalar mesons only , with corresponding set of parameters @xmath44 ; and b ) basic version , which takes into account both the direct production of pseudoscalar mesons and their production from the decays of resonances , with set of parameters @xmath45 .",
    "+ now we introduce the notion `` rank '' following ff2 .",
    "let us consider the `` hierarchy '' structure of the final mesons produced when a quark of type `` a '' fragments into hadrons .",
    "new quark pairs @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 etc . , are produced and `` primary '' mesons are formed .",
    "the `` primary '' meson @xmath49 that contains the original quark is said to have `` rank '' one , the `` primary '' meson @xmath50 `` rank '' two , the `` primary '' meson @xmath51 `` rank '' three , etc .",
    "finally , some of the `` primary '' mesons decay and it is assigned , that all the decay products to have the `` rank '' of the parent .",
    "the order in `` hierarchy '' is not the same as order in momentum or rapidity . +",
    "as it was mentioned above we use for sff and dff formulae obtained in ff2 .",
    "unfortunately , corresponding expressions are very long and inconvenient for reading .",
    "we do not presented these formulae here , and only remind the numbers of corresponding equations in ff2 . for sff",
    "it is used formula ( 2.57 ) from ff2 .",
    "the structure of dff is more complicate and consists of five terms : ( i ) the probability that the primary meson at @xmath0 is of rank 1 and the primary meson at @xmath1 is of rank 2 , given by ( 2.43a ) ; ( ii ) the probability that @xmath0 is of rank one , but @xmath1 is of rank higher than 2 , given by ( 2.43b ) ; ( iii ) the probability that the primary meson at @xmath0 is not first in rank but higher , but the primary meson at @xmath1 is directly of next rank to the one at @xmath0 , given by ( 2.43c ) ; ( iv ) neither the primary meson at @xmath0 or @xmath1 is first in rank , nor are they adjacent , given by ( 2.43d ) . as it is pointed out in ff2 , the complete dff for producing two hadrons of flavor @xmath52 and @xmath53 is given by symmetrizing ( 2.43a - d ) with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "( 2.44 ) of ff2 ) .",
    "as pointed out in ff2 , inclusion in the consideration the mesons produced from the decays of resonances complicates the structure of equations ( 2.43a - d ) and adds next term ( v ) corresponding to the contribution from the case where both the mesons at @xmath0 and @xmath1 came from the decay of the same resonance ( type @xmath54 ) given by formula ( 2.59 ) of ff2 .",
    "+ there are two sources of correlations in the discussed model . naturally , there is the correlation among secondary particles that are the decay products of the same primary meson .",
    "in addition , however , the primary mesons are not formed at random in @xmath24 .",
    "primary mesons adjacent in rank are correlated in both flavor and @xmath24 since they each contain a quark ( or antiquark ) that came from the same @xmath55 pair .",
    "the two primary mesons of adjacent rank tend to occur near each other in @xmath24 .",
    "all flavor correlations in the quark jets occur between primary mesons of adjacent rank .",
    "the flavor of a meson of rank @xmath56 is independent of the flavor of the meson of rank @xmath57 .",
    "+ the observable which is widely used for the investigation of correlation between two hadrons produced in the any hard process is the two - body correlation function .",
    "it is a function of single and double hadron multiplicities @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . in our case",
    "@xmath60 denote the hadrons , @xmath61 ; @xmath62 denote the fraction of the virtual photon energy @xmath63 carried by @xmath64-th hadron , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the energy of the @xmath64-th hadron . in this work",

    "in the absence of any dynamical correlations , the probability to observe in a single jet one hadron with fraction of energy @xmath0 and second hadron with @xmath1 , together with anything else , would be equal to the product of the probabilities to find hadrons with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in different jets and @xmath94 , as we defined it in eqs.(2)-(4 ) , would be close to zero . really , it is true only in case @xmath113 . when @xmath114 the correlation function for the pair of hadrons , which can not be produced adjacent in rank becomes negative , because of the necessity of the production of the additional particles . even in the case , when hadrons can be produced adjacent in rank part of energy is lost because the additional hadrons are produced in result of decays of resonances , which also leads to the reduction of correlations .",

    "<S> very successful hadronization model for the production of mesons in the jets of initial quarks was proposed thirty years ago by field and feynman . </S>",
    "<S> the model is used so far in the design of experiments and for comparison with the experimental data . in this work </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that correlation function in that model , as a function of the energies of two final hadrons has interesting properties ( energies are taken in fractions of initial quark energy , and equal @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) . in particular , for some pairs of mesons there are kinematic regions over variable @xmath1 ( at fixed values of @xmath0 ) , where it is positive and unexpectedly large . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental investigation of the correlation functions in these kinematic regions has twofold interest , from one side it can help to investigate some delicate properties of quark jets and from the other side can help to verify the physical suppositions of model , and to obtain more precise values of parameters . </S>"
