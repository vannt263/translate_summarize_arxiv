    "quasar absorption lines provide a unique and intriguing way to determine the kinematics , chemical composition , and ionization state of gas in intervening galaxies . for most galaxies ,",
    "a multi  phase interstellar medium ( ism ) ( i.e. a medium with different densities and temperatures ) is likely to exist @xcite .",
    "thus , it follows that any random line of sight passing through a galaxy is likely to encounter several phases of gas .",
    "strong absorbers ( @xmath15   ) are almost always found within an impact parameter of @xmath16  kpc of a luminous galaxy ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 is the schechter luminosity @xcite .",
    "in addition , the strong absorption that is characteristic of most such absorbers is thought @xcite to arise in a corona similar to that surrounding the milky way disk @xcite .",
    "we study the @xmath0 system along the line of sight to the quasar pg  @xmath1 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this system is a strong absorber with at least five blended components and with a deficiency of relative to other systems with similar @xmath20 @xcite . in a previous study , @xcite derived constraints on the physical properties of the system , based upon the combination of low  resolution data from the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on  board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and high  resolution data from the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on the keck i telescope . at that time , only low ",
    "resolution data were available for many key transitions , including low  ionization tracers ( and ) , high  ionization tracers ( and ) , and the lyman ",
    "series lines .",
    "however , the hires profiles of , , and were used to form a template that was applied to model the low  resolution data .",
    "based on the fos and hires data , @xcite came to the following conclusions : ( 1 ) the metallicity ( expressed in the solar units ) of the phase would be low ( @xmath21 ) if it was to produce a full lyman limit break ; ( 2 ) a broad component ( @xmath22  ) was needed to fit the profile ; ( 3 ) an additional broad component also appeared to be needed to produce ; ( 4 ) could not fully arise in the inferred low or high  ionization phases , which suggested the existence of a blend or an additional component .",
    "however , some important issues still remained unresolved : ( 1 ) whether the could be produced in the same clouds as ; ( 2 ) whether the ionization conditions vary across the profiles ; ( 3 ) whether is produced by a single , broad phase or by several separate , narrower clouds ; and ( 4 ) whether is affected by a blend and , if not , how is it produced ?",
    "the first issue is important because is under  produced by the phase in many strong absorption systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , absorption is often very strong in the environment where damped absorbers ( dlas ) arise and therefore could be used to trace the origin of the strongest absorption . a resolution to the / issue in the case of the @xmath0 system",
    "could serve as a basis for solving these more general problems .",
    "the third issue is of particular interest because this system is deficient @xcite .",
    "most strong absorbers have comparable strong absorption , which is likely to arise in a corona similar to that surrounding the milky way .",
    "although is detected in the low  resolution fos spectrum , it is relatively weak .",
    "therefore , the additional component suggested by @xcite may not be analogous to a corona .",
    "the profiles could be resolved to determine whether the `` corona phase '' is absent , or just weak in .",
    "either low metallicity or high  ionization conditions could lead to weak absorption from a corona .    with the release of grating e230 m spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on  board the hst",

    "the optical part of the spectrum ( with  2853 ,  2796 ,  2803 and  2600 covered between 3723   and 6186   ) was obtained from the hires on the keck i telescope on july 4 and 5 , 1995 @xcite .",

    "these spectra were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the higher  resolution stis spectrum covers most of the key transitions for the @xmath0 system , we only used the fos spectra to study the lyman limit break at @xmath33  , which implies the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath34 .",
    "the data reduction , wavelength calibration , fluxing , and continuum fitting of the fos spectra were performed as part of the qso absorption line key project @xcite .",

    "1207 is blended with  1260 from the @xmath41 system .",
    "only  1239 is shown because no absorption is detected in either of the n0.1emv  @xmath42 profiles and  1239 is the stronger of the two .",
    "1032 is not shown .",
    "it is clearly inconsistent with the undetected  1038 .",
    "the goal of the present study was to determine the physical conditions under which the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : data ] were produced . to begin , we applied a voigt profile fit to the transitions to determine the locations , column densities , and doppler parameters of the components required to reproduce the observed absorption .",
    "we assumed that each one of these components was produced by an individual `` cloud '' and we modeled each one of these clouds with the photoionization code cloudy , version 90.4 ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "the clouds were assumed to be constant  density , plane ",
    "parallel slabs in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "they were ionized by a @xmath43 haardt and madau ( 1996 ) extragalactic background spectrum normalizing with an ionizing photon density of @xmath44 .",
    "alternative input spectra were also briefly explored , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : specshape ] . to simulate these clouds ,",
    "the required input parameters were : i ) the column density of , @xmath45 , ii ) the metallicity , @xmath46 ( expressed in the units of the solar value ) , iii ) the ionization parameter , @xmath47 ( defined as the ratio of the number density of photons capable of ionizing hydrogen , @xmath48 , to the number density of hydrogen , @xmath49 ) , and iv ) the abundance pattern . the column density of was obtained from the voigt profile fit .",
    "both the metallicity and the ionization parameter were chosen from a range reasonable for interstellar and intergalactic clouds ( i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , with the initial assumption of a solar abundance pattern .",
    "if a simultaneous fit to all transitions was not possible with solar abundances , alternatives were explored .    once the input parameters were specified , we ran cloudy to optimize on the column density of a selected species , such as . during the run ,",
    "cloudy used an initial guess of @xmath52 and calculated the corresponding @xmath45 .",
    "the output @xmath45 was compared to the value measured from the voigt profile fit , and the value of @xmath53 was adjusted accordingly for the next iteration .",
    "this process was repeated until the difference between the output @xmath45 and the designated one was negligible .    upon the completion of the final iteration , the following parameters were retrieved for the resulting cloud : the column density of every species with spectral coverage , the size of the cloud , and the temperature .",
    "the temperature was used to calculate the thermal component of the doppler parameter of each ion , according to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the atomic weight of the ion .",
    "the turbulent component of @xmath27 , which is due to the bulk motion of the gas and is the same for all the ions , was calculated from the measured @xmath56 using @xmath57 . combining the turbulent and thermal components , we obtained the doppler parameter of all other individual ions .",
    "cloudy was run for all five clouds , each time calculating @xmath58 and @xmath27 for each species .",
    "a `` pure '' spectrum was then produced for each transition from the @xmath58 and @xmath27 of all five components .",
    "then , we generated a synthetic spectrum by convolving the `` pure '' spectrum with the instrumental spread function .",
    "finally , the synthetic spectrum was superimposed on the observed one for comparison .",
    "we experimented with various metallicities and ionization parameters and attempted to obtain a synthetic spectrum that displayed minimal discrepancy with the observed one . a visual comparison of goodness of fit was used to reject models , as illustrated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this was adequate to confidently constrain parameters to a relatively narrow range within the very large parameter space .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 values given below are accurate to about @xmath8  dex .",
    "we considered using a quantitative @xmath30 approach , but found it to be impractical because a single pixel or group of pixels for a particular transition often dominated the assessment .",
    "we encountered several issues that were unresolvable using a single phase of gas : was under  produced for any choice of @xmath47 ; the shape of the profile could not be fit ; the velocity centroids of and were offset from that of ; and the and transitions could not be fit simultaneously .",
    "additional clouds were included in the phase to account for the offset and absorption .",
    "the resolution of the other three issues requires the inclusion of independent phases : a colder , denser phase is needed to produce the observed absorption in . a broad , low ",
    "metallicity component is needed to account for the shape of the profile .",
    "finally , a collisionally ionized phase is needed to fit without over  producing .",
    "each of these phases will be explained in detail in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "here we present constraints on each of the four phases required to fit the @xmath0 system , beginning with the lowest  ionization phase .",
    "table 1 provides a summary of the cloud properties for all four phases in a plausible model that satisfies all constraints .",
    "the five clouds from the original voigt profile fit could not produce the observed equivalent width of , regardless of the choice of ionization parameter .",
    "the ratio @xmath61/@xmath62 is nearly constant at @xmath63 over a large range of ionization parameters , @xmath47 , and for the range of metallicity appropriate for this system .    in order to obtain the observed equivalent width ratio @xmath64 , a difference in the curve of growth between the two transitions",
    "was used , as shown in figure  [ fig : mgcog ] . in general , when an absorption profile is unsaturated , its equivalent width , @xmath65 , increases linearly with its column density , @xmath58 ( i.e. on the linear part of curve of growth ) . however ,",
    "when the absorption becomes saturated , @xmath65 stays almost constant with @xmath58 , at a value that depends only on doppler parameter , @xmath27 ( i.e. on the flat part of curve of growth ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mgcog ] , our typical @xmath62 is on the flat part of the curve of growth , while @xmath61 is on the linear part .",
    "thus , we could produce a larger @xmath64 using a smaller @xmath27 , in a `` phase '' .",
    "a unique voigt profile fit to could not be obtained .",
    "we assumed five clouds at the same velocities as the broader cloud components , with a constant doppler parameter and a constant ionization parameter .",
    "the doppler parameter is constrained to be @xmath66  , in order that is not over  produced by the combination of this phase and the cloud phase ( see   [ sec : mgii ] ) .",
    "however , the ionization parameter has to be @xmath67 for @xmath68 , in order that is not over  produced .",
    "alternatively , @xmath69 if @xmath70 ( is on the flat part of the curve of growth ) .",
    "column densities for a sample model with @xmath71 and @xmath72 are listed in table 1 . with @xmath71 ,",
    "the temperature is constrained to be lower than @xmath73  k. cloudy yields an effective temperature close to this value for the clouds in our sample model .",
    "an ionization parameter of @xmath72 corresponds to a cloud density of @xmath74  .",
    "the cloud sizes are quite small , ranging from @xmath75@xmath76  au .",
    "if the @xmath27 parameter is small , the phase will have trivial contribution to the overall equivalent width of any high  ionization metal transition . in figure",
    "[ fig : metals ] , the dotted lines represent the contribution from the phase for the model listed in table 1 .",
    "the contribution to is negligible , therefore has to be entirely produced by the cloud phase ( see   [ sec : mgii ] ) .    assuming the five clouds have the same metallicity , the metallicity of this phase is constrained to be @xmath77 , by the profile . at @xmath78 ,",
    "the column densities of the five clouds are in the range of @xmath79 , as listed in table 1 , yielding an effective total of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , at this metallicity , the phase will give rise to the full lyman limit break detected in the fos spectrum , which requires @xmath34 .",
    "the column densities and @xmath27 parameters of the five clouds were obtained from a voigt profile fit to the residuals in unaccounted for by the phase .",
    "the five clouds in this phase have considerably larger @xmath27 parameters ( @xmath81  ) than the clouds , as listed in table 1 .    with the detection of strong in clouds @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ,",
    "the ionization parameters of these clouds are constrained by @xmath85/@xmath45 .",
    "the remaining two clouds ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) must have higher ionization parameters , since is very weak .",
    "was used to determine their ionization states , with the assumption that the transitions arise in the same phase as .",
    "thus , the five clouds have ionization parameters of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively , as listed in table 1 .",
    "the and profiles are not aligned with the bulk of the absorption seen in , , and the other low  ionization transitions .",
    "thus , additional offset clouds with higher ionization parameters are needed .",
    "a voigt profile fit to yielded two additional clouds ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) at @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "again , column densities and @xmath27 parameters of these two clouds are listed in table 1 .",
    "ionization parameters are constrained to be @xmath97 and @xmath98 , by @xmath99/@xmath100 .",
    "this is also consistent with the weak absorption displayed in the red wings of the and profiles .",
    "a wide range of ionization states ( @xmath101 ) is displayed in this phase , with a tendency for increase in ionization stage from blue to red in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , most of the absorption in both low  ionization transitions , such as , , , and , and high  ionization transitions , such as , , and , is produced in this phase , as shown in figure  [ fig : metals ] .",
    "however , the substantial under  production of suggests the existence of an extra component , as discussed in   [ sec : collisional ] .",
    "assuming that all seven clouds in the phase have the same metallicity , the metallicity is constrained to be @xmath102 by the lyman series .",
    "however , even at the lower limit of @xmath103 , with @xmath104 , the phase contributes insignificantly to the observed full lyman limit break .",
    "alternatively , if the and phases are assumed to have the same metallicities , a metallicity of @xmath105 is required by the profile ( figure  [ fig : hydro ] ) . as mentioned in   [ sec : mgi ] , at this metallicity the five clouds will give rise to the observed full lyman limit break ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the profile is too broad to be fully produced by the and clouds , as is shown in figure  [ fig : hydro ] .",
    "however , if the metallicity was decreased to give rise to more , the narrower would be over  produced .",
    "the curve of growth of the lyman ",
    "series lines @xcite allows for a centered , broad component that can resolve this dilemma ( i.e. it accounts for the broader , deeper profile , as well as the wing structure in , without over  producing the narrower profile . )    a voigt profile fit to yielded the column density and @xmath27 parameter of the broad phase .",
    "if @xmath106   and @xmath107 , we can produce the saturated absorption from @xmath108 to @xmath109  , but the wings will be over  produced ; if @xmath110   and @xmath111 , we can produce the range of the saturated absorption , but the wings will be under  produced .",
    "the best fit was found to be with @xmath112 and @xmath113  .    in principle , the broad component could be either photoionized or collisionally ionized . in both cases ,",
    "the metallicity is constrained so as not to over  produce any of the high  ionization transitions ( i.e. , and ) .",
    "the and are not detected , and is fully produced in the phase ( as required by the structure appearing in the profiles . ) .    for photoionization , an upper limit of @xmath13 is placed on the metallicity , regardless of the choice of ionization parameter .",
    "otherwise , either low or high  ionization transitions would be over  produced .",
    "if the metallicity is @xmath114 , there will be no constraint on the ionization parameter from the metal transitions .",
    "none of them is significantly produced at such a low metallicity .",
    "however , a rough upper limit of @xmath115 can be estimated by the requirement of a reasonable cloud size ( less than several hundred kpcs ) . a good fit for this phase",
    "was obtained for a model with a metallicity of @xmath116 and an ionization parameter of @xmath117 , as listed in table 1 .",
    "this model gives a cloud @xmath118  kpc in size .",
    "the fit to the lyman series is shown by the dashed  dotted curve in figure  [ fig : hydro ] .",
    "for collisional ionization with pure thermal broadening ( i.e. no bulk motion ) , the temperature would be @xmath119  k , using @xmath120/@xmath55 for . at this temperature",
    ", the metallicity has to be exceptionally low , @xmath121 , in order not to over  produce the high  ionization transitions .",
    "if , instead , bulk motion contributes , the @xmath27 parameter will be larger for each metal species than the one given by pure thermal scaling of @xmath122 .",
    "for example , as the temperature decreases from @xmath119  k , @xmath123 increases towards a peak at @xmath124  k. this , together with a larger @xmath125 , gives a larger equivalent width when bulk motion is involved . in order not to over  produce , the metallicity has to be even lower than the pure thermal case .",
    "a metallicity as low as @xmath126 is unlikely . therefore ,",
    "collisional ionization is ruled out for this phase .",
    "the broad absorption is more likely to arise in a photoionized cloud , but even then the metallicity is constrained to be quite low ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the broad , smooth absorption profiles in the transitions are not consistent with the structure apparent in the profiles .",
    "because is offset relative to , it also can not be produced by the centered , broad phase .",
    "the need to produce without contributing a substantial amount of absorption to other transitions suggests the existence of a collisionally ionized phase .",
    "a voigt profile fit to the residuals in yielded a component at @xmath127 , with @xmath128 and @xmath129  . however , for collisional ionization , peaks at @xmath130 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath131  .",
    "therefore , bulk motion must also contribute to the overall velocity dispersion .",
    "the temperature range was found to be @xmath132  k , in order not to over  produce the transitions of higher and lower  ionization stages .",
    "the metallicity of this phase could be set to the same value as the and phases , @xmath105 , but it is not well constrained .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath133 is placed by the the lyman ",
    "series lines .",
    "for all the previous results , we have used the @xmath43 haardt and madau extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) spectrum @xcite as the only source of ionizing photons . here",
    "we consider the likelihood of additional stellar contributions and consider the effect of such alternative spectra in a couple of extreme examples .    at redshift",
    "@xmath134 the extragalactic background radiation is more likely to dominate stellar contributions than it is at other redshifts . at lower redshifts , the amplitude of the haardt and madau extragalactic",
    "background is lower ( by a factor of seven at @xmath135 @xcite ) . at much higher redshifts ,",
    "starbursts are common and the amplitude of the ebr from quasars has levelled off .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of the pg  @xmath136 line of sight , we have no information about the colors or morphologies of the host galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out a starburst host for the @xmath0 absorber .",
    "only an extreme starburst would affect the results , and only within @xmath137  kpc of the center of such a galaxy would the stellar contribution strongly dominate the ebr ( @xmath5% of the photon flux of @xmath138 would escape the burst region @xcite ) .",
    "we would expect the absorption from the central region of a starburst to be stronger than it is for this @xmath0 system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we would expect to pass through some layers of highly ionized gas , and this absorber is weak in and undetected in and .",
    "therefore , a strong starburst host galaxy is unlikely , but we still consider here the effect of a couple of modified spectra .",
    "many different spectral shapes would be possible once we allow a stellar contribution and it is unrealistic to consider them all , so we choose two extreme cases : 1 ) a @xmath139  gyr instantaneous burst , which is characterized by the edges of , , and ; and 2 ) a @xmath8  gyr instantaneous burst with an extreme edge , but with a relatively flat spectrum above that edge , similar to the haardt and madau shape .",
    "both stellar spectra , assuming solar metallicity and a salpeter imf , were taken from @xcite .",
    "we have run models with the burst contribution set to ten times that of the ebr , at @xmath5 rydberg .",
    "we begin with the model in table  1 and consider how the addition of the burst would affect our conclusions . in a more realistic model , however , the spectral shape would be a function of position , with the ebr likely to be dominant at some locations , but the solution to that case would be in between the extreme starburst models and a pure haardt and madau model .",
    "stellar contributions from a non - burst model are more likely to dominate the ebr at energies less than @xmath5  rydberg .",
    "this could affect the ionization balance between the neutral and singly ionized transitions .",
    "because of its extreme lyman limit break ( almost a factor of @xmath6 ) , the @xmath8  gyr instantaneous burst model can also be used to represent the rough effects in this case .    for the @xmath139  gyr model , due to the softer spectrum ( because of the edges of helium )",
    ", the is under  produced compared to the pure haardt and madau case .",
    "for the same reason , for the clouds optimized on , the lower  ionization transitions are found to be over  produced compared to . with this spectral shape",
    ", we can not produce even the weak , observed . in principle , this could relate to why this system is deficient , but in practice it is difficult to understand how such a strong stellar flux could affect a large enough region to reduce the high  ionization absorption at all velocities .",
    "the metallicity that we would infer for the @xmath139  gyr model would be quite similar ( within @xmath8  dex ) to that for the pure haardt and madau case .    for the @xmath8  gyr model , there are relatively fewer ionizing photons just above the edge , and",
    "so more hydrogen remains neutral .",
    "this gives rise to a stronger line . to match the observed profile ,",
    "the metallicity would have to be increased , but only by @xmath140  dex . due to the similar shape to the haardt and madau spectrum above the edge ,",
    "the ionization conditions are not very different for metal  line transitions .",
    "slightly more is produced in the @xmath8  gyr model , but this would require an ionization parameter adjustment of only @xmath141  dex .",
    "it is also important to note that for neither burst model is our conclusion altered about the need for an additional phase .",
    "however , the @xmath8  gyr burst model does give rise to a larger amount of in the clouds , which would somewhat change constraints on the cloud densities and sizes .",
    "based upon modeling of high  resolution hst / stis and keck / hires absorption profiles of the @xmath0 strong absorber toward pg  @xmath1 , we derived the physical conditions of the phases of gas encountered along the line of sight . here , we summarize the physical conditions ( densities , temperatures , size of structures ) that characterize each of the phases . these properties indicate relationships between the gas phases and various structures in the milky way , as well as in other galaxies in the local universe .      seven blended components with @xmath27 parameters ranging from @xmath142@xmath143",

    "they are also similar to most other clouds in strong absorbers @xcite .",
    "the similarity with the milky way disk ism and the connection between strong absorbers and the majority of @xmath18 galaxies suggests that the absorption comes from the warm ism of a spiral disk .",
    "however , strong absorption can also come from early  type galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the three deficient absorbers in their sample had among the reddest @xmath147 colors and the highest luminosities .",
    "the similarity of the low  ionization gas properties between `` classic '' strong absorbers and deficient absorbers would then suggest that early  type galaxies house regions with an ism similar to that in spirals .",
    "perhaps the most interesting and surprising result of our modeling was our inference of the existence of a cold phase ( @xmath148  k ) .",
    "it consists of dense ( @xmath149  ) pockets that give rise to the bulk of the absorption in the form of very narrow ( @xmath150  ) components .",
    "this phase also gives rise to the observed full lyman limit break if @xmath78 for all the clouds .",
    "these `` pockets '' are quite small , only @xmath10  au .    from many different techniques ,",
    "there is conclusive evidence for the existence of small  scale structure in the milky way ism down to scales of @xmath151  au and lower .",
    "the techniques include high  resolution absorption studies toward globular clusters and binary stars ( eg . @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) and 21-cm absorption studies toward extragalactic sources and high  velocity pulsars ( eg . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the highest  resolution absorption studies yielded small @xmath27 parameters , @xmath5@xmath152  , for some of the features @xcite , consistent with our proposed pockets . the observed small ,",
    "high  density structures have been difficult to reconcile with the idea that the ism is in pressure balance .",
    "their pressures are two orders of magnitude larger than the pressure of the warm , ionized inter - cloud medium . in the context of this @xmath0 system ,",
    "the pressure of these pockets would be inconsistent with pressure confinement by the clouds .",
    "there have been several efforts to reconcile the issue of pressure balance in the interstellar medium .",
    "@xcite has investigated a fractal structure model , driven by turbulence , that leads to significant clumping on small scales .",
    "@xcite has considered modifications of the standard cooling paradigms as well as alternative geometries .",
    "@xcite investigated the idea that the small clouds are self  gravitating . regardless of the mechanism of formation and stability of these small structures , it is clear that they are pervasive in the disk of the milky way .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that we would see them in absorption through other galaxies such as this one probed by the pg  @xmath1 line of sight .",
    "we should note , however , that since there is no definite theory for their existence , our assumption that these clouds are in equilibrium may only be an approximation to a more complex physical situation .    a clue about the spatial arrangement of the cold and warm absorbing gas in the @xmath0 system comes from the relative sizes we have derived from the photoionization models .",
    "the sizes of the pockets are @xmath153@xmath154 times smaller than those of the clouds , yet we find several of them along this line of sight .",
    "this suggests a sheet  like structure such that the covering factor is large , or perhaps a fractal structure as proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition , depending on the geometry , such small clouds could only partially cover the quasar beam , a phenomenon generally associated with absorbing clouds intrinsic to the quasar ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the quasar continuum source beam size would be @xmath155@xmath151 schwarszchild radii at the distance of the quasar , @xmath156@xmath157  au for a @xmath158  @xmath159 black hole .",
    "in fact , the large @xmath160 ratio that led to our proposal of the existence of the cloud phase is common in strong systems . in about half",
    "the strong clouds , a simultaneous voigt profile fit to the and profiles yielded @xmath161 larger than could be reconciled with a single  phase photoionization model @xcite . also , @xcite found a large column density for the strong system at @xmath162 toward q  @xmath163 , and found that it implied either an extremely large density , or a large @xmath164 .",
    "they favored the latter , suggesting that this is a strong lyman limit or damped system .",
    "our results here imply that the former solution , of high  density pockets , is also reasonable .",
    "the existence of these tiny `` pockets '' may also provide a hint about the nature of damped absorbers , especially those at relatively low redshifts .",
    "unlike strong absorbers , which almost always have a @xmath165 galaxy within @xmath166  kpc @xcite , dlas have a variety of types of galaxy hosts @xcite , including dwarfs and low- surface - brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) @xcite .",
    "if the strongest absorption ( the dlas ) occurs in a continuous medium in the central region of a galaxy , it seems difficult to explain why lyman limit absorption ( @xmath167 ) would not occur in a relatively large annulus surrounding the central regions of dwarfs and lsbgs .",
    "however , if the dla is produced in small , high  density pockets of material , it is plausible that the surrounding regions could be evacuated of gas in galaxies with small potential wells .",
    "thus , dwarfs and lsbgs could give rise to dla absorption but not to a significant fraction of ordinary lyman limit systems .",
    "the idea that dlas come from small pockets is supported by other observations . @xcite",
    "have resolved narrow components ( @xmath152@xmath168  ) in an 21-cm absorption profile of the dla at @xmath169 toward b  0738 + 313 . with some thermal scaling",
    ", it would be expected that the associated components would be even narrower , consistent with what we have found in our @xmath0 absorber .",
    "furthermore , the dlas with larger equivalent widths tend to be the ones with many components in their 21-cm absorption profiles ( rao 2002 ; private communication ) , and many of these components are also quite narrow @xcite . finally , the high  ionization absorption associated with dlas is similar to that of classic strong absorbers , as if it is due to parts of the galaxy that are unrelated to the dla region @xcite .",
    "dlas could simply be small concentrations of gas that exist in large numbers in many kinds of environments .",
    "our strong absorber at @xmath0 could be a less extreme ( in its @xmath164 ) and more common version of the same sort of structure .      in our favored model ,",
    "the phase ( with @xmath170  ) severely underproduces , while the phase ( with @xmath9  ) produces only negligible .",
    "this might suggest that there would be an alternative model with intermediate @xmath27 values so that and can be produced in the same clouds .",
    "however , we find that this is not the case .",
    "although , with a smaller value of @xmath27 the observed equivalent width ratio of to can be matched , the fit to is unsatisfactory ( too deep and too narrow ) .",
    "alternatively , we could relax our assumption that the profile is fit with the minimum number of component clouds that produce an adequate fit to the data .",
    "a larger number of clouds could be used , with smaller @xmath27 values ( perhaps @xmath152@xmath168  ) .",
    "it would seem that we could increase the number of clouds ( thus decreasing the maximum @xmath62 for a cloud ) so that is no longer on the flat part of its curve of growth . with on the linear part of its curve of growth",
    ", @xmath160 would be increased .",
    "in fact , this is not an acceptable solution for this system .",
    "as the number of clouds is increased , there is a competing effect that reduces @xmath160 .",
    "increased blending of the superimposed clouds affects the more significantly than the .",
    "this effect dominates so that we are unable to find a model with many moderate @xmath27 clouds to fit the data .",
    "we conclude that a two  phase model , with separate phases producing the and absorption , is the simplest suitable model that can fit both the and profiles and those of other intermediate ionization transitions .",
    "a broad component , with @xmath171   was proposed to produce a self  consistent fit to the , , and profiles . in order that this component does not over  produce any of the high  ionization metal  line transitions , it must have a low metallicity , @xmath13 .",
    "it is consistent with a photoionization model , but the ionization parameter is poorly constrained ( since this phase does not give rise to metals ) .",
    "the size of this cloud is therefore also poorly constrained .",
    "if @xmath172 the size would be @xmath118  kpc .    in most other strong absorbers , the absorption is too strong , and the components too broad , for it to arise in the same phase as the @xcite .",
    "these absorbers also typically require an additional phase to self  consistently fit the lyman series , and it is possible to produce both the high  ionization absorption and the additional absorption with the same phase .",
    "the need for a broad , high  ionization phase is especially evident in cases like the `` double '' strong absorber at @xmath173 toward pg  @xmath174 , in which , , and absorption are all very strong @xcite . such strong , broad , high  ionization absorption also characterizes the corona that surrounds the disk of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the broad phase of the @xmath0 absorber resembles the component of the broad phases proposed for those other strong absorbers .",
    "however , in this case no high  ionization metal  line absorption is produced by the broad phase , which led us to the conclusion that it has very low metallicity .",
    "with such a low metallicity @xmath13 as compared to its clouds ( @xmath175 ) , it seems unlikely that this system is analogous to the milky way corona .",
    "in fact , the low metallicity is more suggestive to a halo structure",
    ". the @xmath27 parameter of @xmath118   could also be consistent with such an interpretation .",
    "this leads back to why the system is `` deficient '' ( and and deficient as well ) .",
    "it is more likely that this absorber is produced by a galaxy without a significant corona .",
    "the alternative , a low  metallicity corona , is less likely since a relatively high metallicity ( @xmath176 for the and phases ) would be indicated for the disk that would produce the corona .",
    "an early  type galaxy would be consistent with this interpretation , but is certainly not a unique solution",
    ". it may be only a coincidence that the broad component in this deficient absorber resembles those needed to fit the lyman series in most other strong absorbers .",
    "another unusual feature of the @xmath0 system is the relatively strong , smooth profile , fit with @xmath177  . since the cloud structure apparent in the profile matches the clouds , we infer collisional ionization with a temperature close to the peak for production , @xmath14  k.    it is interesting to note that a similar situation was found in the case of the @xmath178 multi  cloud weak absorber along this same quasar line of sight @xcite . in that case , the profile was smooth and featureless , and also much stronger than expected from photoionization models of the other phases inferred for that system . in that case , a somewhat smaller temperature of @xmath179  k provided an adequate fit .",
    "the temperatures of these additional , collisionally ionized phases place them on an efficient part of the cooling curve , so they would have to be quite common to be detected during a relatively brief interval .",
    "however , it is reasonable to think that cooling layers heated by supernovae shocks could provide an appropriate environment .",
    "more complex models than pure collisional ionization have been considered to explain the ratios of high  ionization metal  line transitions in the milky way disk @xcite . certainly",
    ", more complex processes than pure collisional ionization could be involved in this case as well .",
    "if strong , smooth profiles for one particular transition are commonly found in strong absorbers , they could be compared in more detail to supernova models and used to track the evolution of the ensemble of supernovae remnants in the universe .",
