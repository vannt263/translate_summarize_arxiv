    "the _ kepler _  mission has altered our understanding of exoplanets , by detecting thousands of exoplanet candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ) or radial velocity follow up ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can completely strip - off an initial h / he envelope @xcite .",
    "this led @xcite and @xcite to argue that all low - mass , close - in planets could have contained h / he envelopes when they were born .",
    "approximately @xmath9 of the _ kepler _  population is consistent with having been completely stripped by evaporation@xcite .",
    "therefore , the planet population has been dramatically sculpted by evaporation , hiding any imprints from the formation process .    for low - mass planets , the mass ( and hence escape temperature )",
    "is dominated by any solid - core .",
    "@xcite speculated that taking into account a planet s evaporative history could be used to place constrains on the planet s composition at birth ( which would otherwise be degenerate , e.g. @xcite , based purely on an instantaneous comparison ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing systems and strongest tests of the evaporation scenario is the _",
    "kepler_36  system @xcite , which contains two planets at similar orbital separations ( in a 7:6 resonance ) . the inner planet ( which we refer to as @xmath10 throughout this work ) has a mass of @xmath11m@xmath2 , density of @xmath12 g  @xmath8  and separation of 0.115au , while the outer planet ( which we refer to as @xmath13 ) has a mass of @xmath14m@xmath2 , density of @xmath15 g  @xmath8  and separation of 0.128au .",
    "thus , @xmath10 is consistent with being a solid , rocky planet , while @xmath13 contains a significant h / he envelope @xcite .",
    "no planet formation scenario can produce such a dichotomy in density at such close separations ; therefore , some evolutionary process must have occurred in order to produce such a system after @xmath16gyr  of evolution .",
    "@xcite studied whether @xmath17 could have had identical envelope - mass fractions at birth , yet match the current observed properties of the planets and found using a simple model of the evaporation with a constant mass - loss `` efficiency '' that both planets could have started with an initial envelope - mass fraction of @xmath18% .",
    "giant impacts after the gas disc dispersed have also been suggested , @xcite , although they have not been tested in any detail .",
    "while the @xcite study was a convincing demonstration that evaporation could explain the current compositional dichotomy , it used a simplistic model of evaporation and made guesses about the core - masses and densities .",
    "furthermore , the initial model for @xmath10 had a radius of @xmath1910r@xmath2 , which is unlikely to constitute a `` bound '' planet @xcite at early timesk , then a planetary radius of @xmath20r@xmath2  is @xmath21r@xmath22 , meaning it will be unstable . ] and as such the initial envelope - mass fraction of @xmath10 was likely overestimated .",
    "the aim of this work is to go beyond the initial study of @xcite and directly infer the initial physical conditions of both @xmath17 by using a detailed evaporation model that predicts present - day mass and radius as a function of core - mass , core composition , initial envelope - mass fraction , and initial cooling - time .",
    "this model has been explicitly obtained from hydrodynamic calculations and accounts for the significant drop in the `` efficiency '' parameter as a planet is stripped completely @xcite .",
    "this is the first study to use such models to quantitatively constrain the possible `` birth '' compositions of an exoplanet system , allowing for direct connection between the system s present - day observed properties and formation theories ( c.f .",
    "the forward - modelling approach of , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we follow @xcite and assume that both @xmath10 and @xmath13 remain on circular orbits at their current separations for their entire lifetimes , but may effect resonance @xcite ] .",
    "we calculate the evolution of each planet independently , including evaporation and bolometric irradiation by the central star . as we evaluate this evolution on grids of initial physical conditions , we are able to use the inferred posterior distribution of the planets present - day properties calculated from the ttvs to constrain these initial conditions .",
    "below , we describe the evolution models in more detail as well as the hierarchical model we use for the statistical inference .      we follow @xcite and use the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite to calculate the evolution of the planet .",
    "we include evaporation by using the @xcite evaporation rates , we do not explicitly include the recently proposed `` boil - off '' phase here @xcite ; although , we do present a case where we attempt to model its consequences .",
    "bolometric irradiation is included using the @xmath23 approach as described by @xcite and @xcite . since _",
    "kepler_36  is an evolved star we must include stellar evolution to get the radius of @xmath13 correct as it is inflated by stellar irradiation late in its evolution .",
    "we use mesa again to perform this calculation using the best fit parameters described by @xcite . the evolution of the x - ray luminosity in terms of the star s bolometric luminosity",
    "is then described by the @xcite empirical fits . for both @xmath10 & @xmath13",
    "we vary the following initial conditions : core - mass , core composition , initial h / he envelope - mass fraction and initial cooling - time ( defined as the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ) .",
    "we then evolve the planet model until the current age of the _",
    "kepler_36  system ( @xmath24gyr ) .",
    "note that the uncertainties in the age of the _ kepler_36  system is @xmath25gyr ; however , since the mass - loss is completely dominated at early times , such an uncertainty in age makes little difference to our results .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to infer the initial conditions of @xmath10 and @xmath13 given their currently observed properties .",
    "however , these present - day quantities are not known precisely ; uncertainties in physical quantities inferred from ttvs are often highly correlated both for an individual planet and for planets in the same system .",
    "we wish to preserve this information in our analysis , as it is both more accurate and constraining & @xmath13 masses are tightly correlated , thus an initial composition not consistent with the evolution of one planet can exclude an initial composition for the other . ]",
    "than assuming random , independent errors on the individual planet parameters .",
    "this sort of inference , in which a model is conditioned on quantities of which the observations are themselves uncertain is known as multi - level or hierarchical inference ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while hierarchical inference can be computationally demanding , it can be greatly simplified if posterior samples of the intermediate quantities ( in this case , the masses and radii of the planets ) have been previously calculated @xcite",
    "fortunately , the fit to the properties of the _ kepler_36  planets was performed within a bayesian formalism and their posterior distributions were estimated from mcmc sampling by @xcite , so we are able to take advantage of this simplification , as described below .    as stated above our model",
    "consists of four parameters for each planet , which we denote by the vector @xmath26 .",
    "the vector of model parameters fitted to the ttv signal is denoted by @xmath27 and the data is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we may write the likelihood function for our model parameters @xmath26 , by a change of variables as : @xmath29 the fit to the ttv signal contain many parameters which are either not relevant to our model ( e.g. , inclination or limb darkening parameters ) or that we choose to fix in our evolution models for the sake of computational efficiency ( e.g. , planetary orbital separations and stellar mass and radius , which have uncertainties of @xmath30% ) .",
    "thus , we can partition @xmath31 into two components : @xmath32 which represent those parameters which our relevant to our model and @xmath33 which represent parameters which are not .",
    "now our model maps a value of @xmath34 into a single point in the @xmath32 space ( @xmath35 ) , thus @xmath36 can be represented by a delta function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , @xmath36 becomes : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the priors on the @xmath33 parameters chosen by @xcite .",
    "now from bayes theorem we can write : @xmath39 where in the final equality we have used the fact the priors on @xmath33 and @xmath32 are independent .",
    "therefore , substituting equations [ eqn : delta1 ] & [ eqn : data1 ] into equation [ eqn : like1 ] and integrating we find : @xmath40 finally , we note that the model parameters used by @xcite consider mass and radius ratios , and we must transform the prior probability in equation  [ eqn : like1 ] to the original set of co - ordinates @xmath41 used by @xcite by use of a jacobian ( @xmath42 ) such that the likelihood function we evaluate is : @xmath43 the function @xmath44 can be estimated directly by kernel density estimation on the mcmc sample provided by @xcite .",
    "the prior distribution @xmath45 used by @xcite was uniform .",
    "we consider uniform priors on all parameters : flat for core - mass and core composition and log - flat for initial envelope - mass fraction and initial cooling - time , although we checked these choices are not driving our results . in the case of the core composition",
    "we use a variable that tracts the percentage of ice or iron in a rock core where the range @xmath46 $ ] corresponds to 100% iron ( -1 ) through to 100% rock ( 0 ) and @xmath47 $ ] corresponding to 100% rock ( 0 ) through to 100% ice ( 1 ) following the @xcite mass - radius relations .",
    "therefore we require our core composition parameter to be in the range @xmath48 $ ] . while formation models should be able to predict the initial cooling - time , at the moment they are unable to do with any certainty , as they are sensitive to the uncertain nebular conditions , disc lifetimes , core formation timescales and migration history .",
    "thus we conservatively set the initial cooling - time to be bounded between 1myr   the minimum protoplanetary disc lifetime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 6.8gyr , the age of the _ kepler_36  system .",
    "finally , in order for the planet to be considered `` bound '' at zero time we restrict the initial radius to be @xmath49r@xmath22 .",
    "we consider three scenarios related to specific insights about their possible formation .",
    "first , we adopt a conservative approach and assume that the two planets properties are unrelated ( scenario i ) , giving 8 free parameters .",
    "second ( scenario ii ) , since the cores of both planets are likely to be formed from the same population of planetesimals and embryos , we assume both the cores of @xmath10 & @xmath13 have the same composition and finally ( scenario iii ) we assume that both planets have the same composition and that both planets experienced a `` boil - off '' phase @xcite after formation . while not accounting for the mass - loss ( our stated `` initial envelope - mass - fractions '' will still be post - boil - off values ) , we can attempt to account for the _ thermodynamic _ state post - boil off , which leaves the planetary radii close to @xmath50r@xmath22 . using figures  4 & 6 of @xcite",
    "we restrict the planet to have a radius between 0.08 and 0.1r@xmath22at the start of the calculation , we note this significantly reduces the available envelope - mass and cooling timescale parameter space .",
    "scenario ii & iii contain 7 free parameters .",
    "since @xmath10 essentially contains no h / he envelope today scenario i & ii will only place limits on the initial envelope - mass fraction , whereas scenario iii will place an actual constraint on the value .",
    "we use the ` e`mcee affine - invariant mcmc sampler @xcite to perform the parameter estimation under the three different scenarios .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : panel ] , where we show the posterior distributions of both @xmath10 & @xmath13 s core - mass , core composition , initial envelope - mass fraction and initial cooling - times for our three scenarios ( i : blue - dotted ; ii : black - dashed ; iii : red - solid ) .",
    "we get good constraints on most parameters , expect perhaps the initial cooling - time of @xmath10 s envelope in scenario i & ii and @xmath13 s core composition in scenario i.    by linking the core composition of @xmath10 & @xmath13 ( scenarios ii & iii ) we tighten the constraints on the parameters , especially the core composition and initial envelope - mass fraction of @xmath13 .",
    "this is not surprising as the present - day h / he envelope on @xmath13 prevents using its mass and radius to explicitly calculate a core composition @xcite .",
    "we do rule out that @xmath13 has an exceedingly iron rich core .",
    "as expected , the initial envelope - mass fraction for planet @xmath10 is only an upper limit in scenario i & ii , but not in scenario iii when we require @xmath10 to have a significant atmosphere at early times .",
    "finally , we note the advantage of incorporating the full correlation structure of the measured quantities of both planets . the uncertainty in the core - mass and composition of planet @xmath10 is primarily driven by the directly measured uncertainties in planet mass and radius determined from the ttv analysis ; in scenario iii , by linking the planet parameters , we decrease these uncertainties .",
    "this is because some of the core compositions consistent with the measured mass and radius of planet @xmath10 are not consistent with the evolutionary history of planet @xmath13 .",
    "our results place the first statistical constraints on the properties of any close - in low mass exoplanet at birth and indicate that current density dichotomy of the _",
    "kepler_36  system does not pose a problem with the idea that they both formed with significant h / he envelopes , consistent with the previous analysis of @xcite . in our most general case",
    ": scenario i , in which the cores of the planets are allowed to have completely independent composition is unlikely from a theoretical perspective . if they formed from the same population of planetesimals / embryos",
    ", the cores should have very similar compositions .",
    "having the two planets form in vastly different regions of the disc ( where the planetesimal compositions could in principle be different ) then convergently migrate to their current location appears highly unlikely : they are in a delicate 7:6 resonance that would require fine tuning to migrate into @xcite .",
    "therefore , while presenting scenario i for completeness and illustrative purposes , we only discuss the implications of scenarios ii and iii further .",
    "the evolution of the envelope - mass fraction for @xmath10 & @xmath13 are shown in figure  [ fig : evolve ] , where we randomly drawn cases from the results for scenario ii ( black ) & iii ( red ) .",
    "these evolutionary curves show the role of core - mass in the evaporative history ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "while @xmath13 retains a significant fraction of its original envelope to late times , the lower mass core of @xmath10 means that it can retain none of its original envelope .",
    "therefore , by considering the evolution of planet @xmath10 we are able to conclude that @xmath10 contains no h / he envelope and is a naked core , compared to previous models which just considered the current mass and radius to put a constraint on the h / he envelope - mass fraction of @xmath51 @xcite ; whereas @xmath13 s initial and final envelope - mass is consistent with the single model calculated by @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result , robust across scenarios , is that we require @xmath13 to have a long initial cooling - time , considerably longer than the few myr one would naively guess based on protoplanetary disc lifetimes and simple formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because models with small initial cooling - times have large initial radii , such that they lose more mass than those with longer cooling - times , therefore , requiring a larger initial envelope - mass to compensate .",
    "eventually , such a large initial envelope - mass and short cooling - time means the planet envelope could no longer be hydrostatic and bound at early times , so the planet could not have had this initial structure .",
    "such a long initial cooling timescale is a strong hint of a dramatic cooling process early in the planet s life .",
    "the `` boil - off '' process , a period of dramatic mass - loss and cooling just after disc dispersal @xcite , indeed produces this type of cooling and is the motivation for scenario iii .",
    "it could also be hinting at evidence of inefficient heat transport ( e.g. , semi - convection , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , possibly occurring after giant impacts , @xcite .",
    "one should be cautious with the results from just one planet , but this kind of modelling provides an avenue for evaluating whether the evolutionary histories of low - mass , close - in planets more generally may require a `` boil - off''like process to have occurred .",
    "one of the motivations of doing this work is we can use these models to peer at exoplanet structure shortly after formation .",
    "one test of a planet formation scenario is the kind of planetary compositions it produces and to first order this can be described in terms of a envelope - mass fraction  core - mass relation .",
    "unfortunately , evaporation can dramatically change this relation when observed at late times @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : x_mcore ] we show the envelope - mass - fraction , core - mass relation for @xmath10 & @xmath13 , as well as the general relation seen in the data at late times from @xcite , where we use @xcite s mass , radius & envelope - mass relations to convert wolfgang et al.s mass - radius relation to a core - mass , envelope - mass relation .     for @xmath10 ( left ) and @xmath13 ( right ) , in scenarios",
    "ii ( black ) and iii ( red ) .",
    "the filled black points and red squares show the best fit parameters .",
    "the magenta point shows the current composition of @xmath13 taken from our models .",
    "the blue lines show the observed relation ( solid ) , 1.0- ( dashed ) and 2.0-@xmath52 spread for the observed planet population today calculated from the @xcite mass - radius relationship . ]",
    "our results suggests that planets with larger core - masses accrete a larger initial envelope , which is not unexpected theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results are consistent within the spread of models found numerically by @xcite , and are consistent with the dusty and gas - poor scalings of @xcite . since @xmath13 appears to be an outlier in terms of its current envelope - mass fraction , drawing inference regarding the more general nature of the _ birth _ envelope - mass , core - mass relation would be premature .",
    "however , the approach demonstrated in this work indicates that with , the now large and growing sample of well constrained low - mass exoplanets one can begin to trace out their initial properties . a well described birth envelope - mass , core - mass relation along with any intrinsic scatter would provide a strong constraint for any planet formation model .",
    "we have used exoplanet evolutionary models that include evaporation to statistically infer the properties of _ kepler_36  @xmath10 & @xmath13 shortly after formation . while @xmath10 & @xmath13 have dissimilar densities today , they are consistent with having a common formation pathway , where the h / he envelope acquired by @xmath10 is completely lost due to evaporation , while the higher core - mass of @xmath13 allows it to retain a large fraction of its original envelope .",
    "our results give promise that with a reasonable sample of well constrained planet masses and radii , we will be able to infer the birth envelope - mass  core - mass relation  similar to the more widely discussed planet mass  radius relation , but directly applicable to formation theories .",
    "the observations necessary to begin this exploration has already been provided by _ kepler _ , and the upcoming tess mission promises to deliver an even larger , possibly age - dependent sample .",
    "finally , @xmath13 s initial cooling - time is constrained to be long ( @xmath53yr ) , significantly longer than predicted based on protoplanetary disc lifetimes of @xmath54myr ; as such , the results indicate that @xmath13 may have undergone a dramatic cooling event early in its lifetime , such as the recently proposed `` boil - off '' process @xcite .",
