    "articulatory speech synthesisers generate sound based on the shape of the vocal tract .",
    "vibration of the vocal folds under the expiratory air flow is the source in the system ; and the vocal tract , consisting of the larynx , pharynx , oral and nasal cavities , constitutes a filter where sound frequencies are shaped .",
    "this creates a number of resonant peaks in the spectrum , known as formants .",
    "the first and second formants ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) are used to distinguish the vowel phonemes , where the value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is controlled by the height and backness - frontness of the tongue body respectively .",
    "traditionally , the acoustic system is approximated by a one - dimensional wave equation that associates the slow varying cross - sectional area of a rigid tube to the pressure wave for a low - frequency sound .",
    "however , complex shape of the vocal tract , with its side branches and asymmetry , has motivated higher dimensional acoustic analysis .",
    "the 3d analysis methods were shown to produce a better representation of the sound spectrum at the price of higher computational cost .",
    "however , some studies suggested that the spectrum yielded by 1d acoustic analysis matches closely that of the 3d analysis for frequencies less than 7khz @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the discrepancy between the resonance frequencies computed by 3d analysis of the vocal tract and the formant frequencies of the recorded audio is a result of insufficient boundary conditions in the wave equation especially in case of the open lips and/or velar port .    in this paper , we follow @xcite in calculating the helmholtz resonances of our vocal tract geometries using 3d fem analysis .",
    "the resonances are then compared to the formant frequencies obtained from the 1d acoustic synthesizer proposed by @xcite and those of the recorded audio .",
    "we use static mri images acquired with a siemens magnetom avanto 1.5 t scanner .",
    "a 12-element head matrix coil , and a 4-element neck matrix coil , allow for the generalize auto - calibrating partially parallel acquisition ( grappa ) acceleration technique .",
    "one speaker , a 26-year - old male , was imaged while he uttered four sustained finnish vowels .",
    "the mri data covers the vocal and nasal tracts , from the lips and nostrils to the beginning of the trachea , in 44 sagittal slices , with an in - plane resolution of 1.9 mm .",
    "figure [ fig : vt ] shows the vt surface geometries extracted from mri data using an automatized segmentation method @xcite .        for our 1d acoustic analysis",
    ", we describe the vocal tract by an area function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance from the glottis on the tube axis and @xmath4 denotes the time .",
    "we take the similar notion of @xcite in defining the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the scaled versions of volume - velocity @xmath7 and air density @xmath8 respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the mass density of the air and @xmath10 is the speed of sound .",
    "we solve for @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the tube using derivations of the linearised navier - stokes equation ( [ eq : navier ] ) and the equation of continuity ( [ eq : cont ] ) subject to the boundary conditions described in equation [ eq : boundarycond ] :    @xmath13    [ eq1 ]    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the wall loss coefficient @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 ; and @xmath20 is the source volume velocity at the glottis .",
    "we couple the vocal tract to a two - mass glottal model @xcite and solve equation [ eq1 ] in the frequency domain using a digital ladder filter defined based on the cross - sectional areas of 20 segments of the vocal tract .",
    "we refer to @xcite for full details of the implementation .    for our 3d acoustic analysis",
    ", we calculate the vowel formants directly from the wave equation by finding the eigenvalues , @xmath21 , and their corresponding velocity potential eigenfunction , @xmath22 , from the helmholtz resonance problem :    @xmath23    [ eq2 ]    where @xmath24 is the air column volume and @xmath25 is its surface including the boundary at mouth opening ( @xmath26 ) , at air - tissue interface ( @xmath27 ) and at a virtual plane above glottis ( @xmath28 ) ; and @xmath29 denotes the exterior normal derivative.the value of @xmath30 regulates the energy dissipation through tissue walls , and the case @xmath31 corresponds with hard , reflecting boundaries .",
    "we calculate the numerical solution of equation [ eq2 ] by finite element method ( fem ) using piecewise linear shape functions and approximately @xmath32 tetrahedral elements .",
    "the imaginary parts of the first two smallest eigenvalues @xmath33 and @xmath34 give first two helmholtz resonances of the vocal tract .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for details of implementation .    in order to distinguish the effects of dimensionality ( 1d vs. 3d ) from the effects of different boundary conditions in equations [ eq1 ] and [ eq2 ] ,",
    "we also compute the webster resonances by interpreting equation [ eq2 ] in one dimension :    @xmath35\\\\ \\tipasafemode \\lambda\\phi_{\\lambda}-c\\phi_{\\lambda}^{'}&=0 & \\text{at } s=0\\\\ \\tipasafemode \\phi_{\\lambda}&=0 & \\text{at } s = l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq3 ]    where @xmath36 denotes the sound speed correction factor that depends on the curvature of the vocal tract ; a(x ) is the area function and s is the implicit parameter to @xmath22 , a , w and @xmath36 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details of implementation and parameter values .",
    "figure [ fig : twoformants ] shows the first two formant / resonance frequencies , computed for the four finnish vowels .",
    "webster formants ( w@xmath37 ) are calculated by solving equation [ eq1 ] , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "helmholtz ( h@xmath38 ) and webster resonances ( w@xmath38 ) are obtained from equations [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] , respectively @xcite .",
    "s@xmath38 denotes the scaled version of w@xmath38 .",
    "the figure also includes the formant frequencies ( a@xmath37 ) computed from audio signals recorded in an anechoic chamber @xcite .",
    "the values are averaged over 10 repetitions of each vowel utterance .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig : twoformants ] , the resonance values ( h@xmath38 , w@xmath38 and s@xmath38 ) lie close together for vowels /i/ and /e/ , with s@xmath38 being closer to h@xmath38 , as expected . for vowels /o/ and /a/ there is more difference in the first resonances of h@xmath38 and w@xmath38 ; for /o/ , although s@xmath38 lies closer to h@xmath38 , its first resonance is surprisingly low . for all of the vowels in figure",
    "[ fig : twoformants ] , the second formant of the audio is less than the computed results .",
    "the vowel /i/ is expected to be very sensitive to glottal end position , which , in turn , suggests the significance of adequate mri resolution and accurate geometry processing for its spectral analysis .",
    "interestingly , the webster formants ( w@xmath37 ) remain closer to the audio formants ( a@xmath37 ) than any of the resonances in the case of /i/ , /e/ , and /a/. for /o/ the distance to the a@xmath37 is almost equal for w@xmath37 and h@xmath38 , with both having similar values for the second formant / resonance ; however , the first h@xmath38 is lower , and the first w@xmath37 is higher , than the first a@xmath37 .    the time - domain webster analysis @xcite accounts for the vt wall - vibration phenomenon that is missing in the resonance analysis .",
    "this is done by substituting @xmath2 , from equation 5.3 , with @xmath39 : where @xmath40 is the slow - varying circumference and @xmath41 is the wall displacement governed by a damped mass - spring system . setting @xmath41 to zero , the webster formants move along the arrows in figure [ fig : twoformants ] , reducing in their first formants .",
    "this moves the w@xmath37 closer to the h@xmath38 as both acoustical models now ignore the wall vibration .",
    "meanwhile , w@xmath37 moves away from the audio formants in the case of /i/ ,",
    "/e/ , and /a/. the distance between w@xmath38 and w@xmath37 remains large , despite the fact that both acoustical models solve the webster equation .",
    "the results imply that 3d helmholtz analysis is more realistic than its 1d webster version , as expected .",
    "overall , our experiments suggest that the time - domain interpretation of acoustic equations provides more realistic results  even if it requires reducing from 3d to 1d",
    ". this may be partially due to the fact that time - domain analysis allows for more complexity in the acoustical model such as inclusion of lip radiation and wall loss .",
    "certainly unknown parameters always remain ( such as those involved in glottal flow , coupling between fluid mechanics and acoustical analysis , etc . ) , which are estimated indirectly , based on observed behaviour in simulations .",
    "it should be noted that our experiments are solely based on data from a single speaker . a larger database  inclusive of more speakers from different genders and languages ",
