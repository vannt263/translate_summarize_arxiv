    "the extended hubbard model with anisotropic spin exchange interactions @xcite is a conceptually simple phenomenological model for studying correlations and for a  description of magnetism and other types of electron orderings in narrow band systems with easy - plane or easy - axis magnetic anisotropy .    in this report",
    "we will focus on the zero - bandwidth limit of the extended hubbard model with magnetic interactions for the case of arbitrary electron density .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath4 where @xmath0  is the on - site density interaction , @xmath5  is @xmath6-component of the intersite magnetic exchange interaction , restricts the summation to nearest neighbours .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath8 at the site @xmath9 , , and .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath10 depending on the concentration of electrons is calculated from @xmath11 with and @xmath12 is the total number of lattice sites .    the model ( [ row:1 ] ) can be treated as an effective model of magnetically ordered insulators . the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be assumed to include all the possible contributions and renormalizations like those coming from the strong electron - phonon coupling or from the coupling between electrons and other electronic subsystems in solid or chemical complexes . in such a general case",
    "arbitrary values and signs of @xmath0 are important to consider . we restrict ourselves to the case of positive , because of the symmetry between ferromagnetic ( ) and antiferromagnetic ( ) case for lattice consisting of two interpenetrating sublattices such as for example sc or bcc lattices .",
    "we have performed extensive study of the phase diagram of the model ( [ row:1 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath13 and @xmath10  @xcite . in the analysis",
    "we have adopted a variational approach ( va ) which treats the on - site interaction @xmath0 exactly and the intersite interaction @xmath1 within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of the positive @xmath1 , as it was mentioned above .",
    "let us point out that in the mfa , which does not take into account collective excitations , one obtains the same results for the model and the model , where the term is replaced with , describing interactions between @xmath14-components of spins at neighbouring sites , . in both cases",
    "the self - consistent equations have the same form , only the replacement is needed and a magnetization along the @xmath6-axis becomes a magnetization in the @xmath14-plane @xcite .    for the model ( [ row:1 ] )",
    "only the ground state phase diagram as a function of @xmath10  @xcite and special cases of half - filling ( )  @xcite and  @xcite have been investigated till now .    within the va the intersite interactions are decoupled within the mfa , what let us find a free energy per site @xmath15 . the condition ( [ row:2 ] ) for the electron concentration and a  minimization of @xmath15 with respect to the magnetic - order parameter lead to a set of two self - consistent equations ( for homogeneous phases ) , which are solved numerically .",
    "the order parameter is defined as , where is the average magnetization in a sublattice in the direction ( @xmath16 corresponds @xmath17 here ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is non - zero the ferromagnetic phase ( f@xmath3 ) is a solution , otherwise the non - ordered phase ( no ) occurs .",
    "phase separation ( ps ) is a state in which two domains with different electron concentration exist in the system ( coexistence of two homogeneous phases ) .",
    "the free energies of the ps states are calculated from the expression : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are values of a free energy at @xmath21 corresponding to the lowest energy homogeneous solutions and is a fraction of the system with a charge density @xmath22 . we find numerically the minimum of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath24",
    ".    in the model considered only ps@xmath3 state ( i.  e. a  coexistence of f@xmath3 and no phases ) can occur .    in the paper",
    "we have used the following convention .",
    "a  second ( first ) order transition is a  transition between homogeneous phases with a  ( dis-)continuous change of the order parameter at the transition temperature .",
    "a  transition between homogeneous phase and ps state is symbolically named as a  `` third order '' transition . during this transition a  size of one domain in the ps state decreases continuously to zero at the  transition temperature .",
    "second order transitions are denoted by solid lines on phase diagrams , dotted curves denote first order transitions and dashed lines correspond to the `` third order '' transitions .",
    "we also introduce the following denotation : for , where @xmath25 is the number of nearest neighbours .",
    "obtained phase diagrams are symmetric with respect to half - filling because of the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ row:1 ] ) , so the diagrams will be presented only in the range .",
    "in the ground state the energies of homogeneous phases have the form : for no : and for f@xmath26 : if and if . comparing the energies we obtain diagram shown in fig .",
