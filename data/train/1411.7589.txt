    "a challenging task for multivariate polynomial interpolation is the construction of a suitable set of node points .",
    "depending on the application , these node points should provide a series of favorable properties including a unique interpolation in given polynomial spaces , a slow growth of the lebesgue constant and simple algorithmic schemes that compute the interpolating polynomial .",

    "although different trajectories are possible , this movement is typically performed in form of a lissajous curve  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the particle density from the data on the lissajous trajectory is currently done in a very straight forward way , either by solving a system of linear equations based on a pre - measured system matrix or directly from the measurement data  @xcite . by using multivariate polynomial interpolation on the nodes of the sampling path ,",
    "i.e. the lissajous curve , we hope to obtain a further improvement in the reconstruction process .    of the node points mentioned above , the padua points , as described in @xcite ,",
    "are the ones with the strongest relation to lissajous curves .",
    "they can be characterized as the node points of a particular degenerate lissajous figure .",
    "moreover , they satisfy a series of remarkable properties : they can be described as an affine variety of a polynomial ideal  @xcite , they form a particular chebyshev lattice  @xcite and they allow a unique interpolation in the space @xmath0 of bivariate polynomials of degree @xmath1  @xcite . furthermore , a simple formula for the lagrange polynomials is available and the lebesgue constants are growing slowly as @xmath2  @xcite .    the aim of this article is to develop , similar to the padua points , an interpolation theory for node points on lissajous curves . to this end , we extend the generating curve approach as presented in @xcite to particular families of curves in @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] . in this article , we will focus on the node points of non - degenerate lissajous curves , which are important for the application in mpi  @xcite .",
    "not all of the above mentioned properties of the padua points will be carried over to the node points of lissajous figures . however , the resulting theory will have some interesting resemblences , not only to the theory of the padua points , but also to the xu points .",

    "<S> motivated by an application in magnetic particle imaging , we study bivariate lagrange interpolation at the node points of lissajous curves . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory is a generalization of the polynomial interpolation theory developed for a node set known as padua points . with appropriately defined polynomial spaces </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the node points of non - degenerate lissajous curves allow unique interpolation and can be used for quadrature rules in the bivariate setting . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit formula for the lagrange polynomials allows to compute the interpolating polynomial with a simple algorithmic scheme . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the already established schemes of the padua and xu points , the numerical results for the proposed scheme show similar approximation errors and a similar growth of the lebesgue constant . </S>"
