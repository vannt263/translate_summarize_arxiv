    "a new era of galaxy cluster surveys , based on measuring distortions in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , has begun .",
    "these distortions , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , have been detected for the first time in untargeted surveys over large areas of the sky by two new mm - band experiments : the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) .",
    "first results from act @xcite and spt @xcite offer a taste of the future potential these experiments hold for obtaining large samples of essentially mass - selected clusters to arbitrary redshifts and have also provided the first measurement of the microwave background at arc - minute angular scales @xcite .    both act and spt aim to provide unique samples of massive clusters of galaxies , selected by mass nearly independently of redshift , over a large area of the southern sky .",
    "while the number density of sze - selected clusters can be used as a potentially strong probe of dark energy  as well as for studies of cluster physics , it is crucial to understand the systematics of sze surveys by comparing with cluster identification using independent methods before the new cluster samples can be effectively used .",
    "for example the low amplitude of the sz component in the high-@xmath2 cmb power spectrum @xcite or stacked clusters in wmap @xcite are recent issues that provide additional motivation for an independent search for clusters over the region being surveyed in the sz .",
    "furthermore , although the new mm - band telescopes can be used to identify clusters , coordinated optical data are necessary for confirmation and to determine redshifts and other fundamental properties of the new clusters .",
    "the last decade has seen significant effort to produce large and well - selected optical catalogs of cluster of galaxies that can be used in cosmological , large - scale structure and galaxy evolution studies .",
    "the first systematic attempts to generate large samples of clusters , and to define their richness , came from the abell catalogs @xcite which searched for projected galaxy overdensities through visual inspection of photographic plates successfully identifying thousands of clusters .",
    "although optical catalogs can be relatively inexpensive and efficient at detecting low mass systems , early attempts were known to suffer from significant projection effects along the line of sight .",
    "the advent of ccd cameras and the digitization of large photographic plates has enabled the development of new search algorithms for galaxy clusters using a combination of space , brightness and color information ( i.e. photometric redshifts ) , minimizing projection issues ( see * ? ? ? * for a historical review of search methods ) . among these algorithms",
    "are the pioneering implementation of a spatial matched filter technique @xcite and its variants @xcite , the adaptive kernel technique @xcite , voronoi tessellation @xcite and methods exploiting the tight ridgeline in color - magnitude space of galaxies in clusters @xcite such as the red cluster sequence ( rcs ) @xcite and the maxbcg @xcite techniques .",
    "this new wave of studies have produced large sets of well - defined optical cluster catalogs covering thousands of square - degrees ( i.e. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) providing reliable richness - mass correlations @xcite and establishing independent cosmological constraints @xcite using optical catalogs .    in this article",
    "we present new results from the southern cosmology survey ( scs ) , our on - going multi - wavelength survey coordinated with act .",
    "our first paper in this series , @xcite , described our scs imaging pipeline and presented a sample of new galaxy clusters from an @xmath3  deg@xmath4 optical imaging survey of the southern sky acquired at the blanco 4-m telescope . here",
    ", we complete our cluster analysis using all the 70  deg@xmath4 contiguous imaging available , which represents a comoving volume of 0.076  gpc@xmath5 at @xmath6 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath7  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 and matter density @xmath10 .",
    "our cluster analysis is based on all of the public unprocessed imaging data available for download at the time of writing from the observations carried out for the blanco cosmology survey ( bcs ) proposal .",
    "this was a noao large survey project ( 05b-0043 , pi : joe mohr ) that was awarded 45 nights between 2005 and 2007 to carry out intermediate depth @xmath11band observations on the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) blanco 4-m telescope using the @xmath12 pixel ( 0.36  deg@xmath4 ) mosaic - ii camera .",
    "the survey originally aimed to target two square @xmath13  deg@xmath4 southern sky patches centered near declinations @xmath14 and @xmath15 at right ascensions of 23 hr and 5 hr respectively , that were to be contained in a larger sze common region that both act and spt would survey .",
    "after three years of observations the survey acquired 78 and 118 mosaic - ii contiguous pointings at 23hr and 5hr respectively that correspond to 29  deg@xmath4 and 41  deg@xmath4 over each patch reaching a total of 70  deg@xmath4 imaged in all @xmath1 filters .",
    "the pointing layout and the sky area covered for each patch is shown in figure  [ fig : densemap ] . the survey was awarded 15 extra nights at the end of 2008 to complete the proposed 100  deg@xmath4 ; our analysis does not include this extra year s worth of observations as the data are not publicly available yet .       and width @xmath16 over the 23hr ( top panel ) 5hr ( bottom panel ) field .",

    "we briefly outline the steps involved and recent improvements from our original analysis .",
    "our pipeline automatically handles the file associations and all of the initial standard ccd imaging tasks for each night s run as well as the secondary calibration steps ( i.e. , skyflats , fringe correction , cosmic - ray rejection , badpixel masks , world coordinate calibration , etc . )",
    "using a custom modified version of iraf / mscred @xcite . when observed , photometric standards from the southern hemisphere standards stars catalog @xcite were processed by the pipeline and a photometric zero - point",
    "was estimated in ab magnitudes .",
    "hereafter all magnitude quoted are in the ab system . in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] we show the observing dates , photometric conditions and observed bands that comprise the dataset we analyzed and that were used for this paper .",
    "we note that the information that went into creating this table was extracted from the raw data and header information of the data files .        in general each mosaic  ii pointing consisted of exposures of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the @xmath21 and @xmath22bands respectively with offsets of @xmath23  arcmin ( within each filter ) .",
    "we adjusted the photometric zero points of non - photometric nights using the overlapping regions between tiles and their matched sources from adjacent photometric tiles providing a homogeneous photometric calibration across each region with typical variations below @xmath24  mags .",
    "the 2007 season data at 23hr was particularly hard to match due to poor observing conditions and large variations within the individual exposures in each tile .",
    "we tackled this problem by first scaling all individual exposures comprising a tile to a common median scale ; this step ensured that opposed edges of a combined frame could be effectively used to photometrically tie down adjacent tiles .",
    "this is a new feature of the pipeline .",
    "all science images were mosaicked , aligned and median combined using swarp @xcite to a plate scale of @xmath25/pixel .",
    "source detection and photometry measurements for the science catalogs were performed using sextractor @xcite .",
    "large variations in the galactic dust absorption on the 5hr field led us to implement dust correction for every source in each observed band in the science catalogs utilizing the infrared maps and c - routines provided by @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important to obtain unbiased colors for photometric redshifts . in figure",
    "[ fig : dustmap ] we show our custom generated @xmath26 galactic dust absorption maps for the 5hr and 23hr regions , where darker regions represent areas of higher obscuration . from this figure",
    "we can see that in the 23hr region foreground galactic absorption is negligible , while at 5hr it can be as high as @xmath27 magnitudes . finally , we determine photometric redshifts from the four - band optical images and the galactic  extinction  corrected magnitudes using bpz @xcite following the same procedure as discussed in @xcite .",

    "* ned i d : 2masx ) , which we report if it is within @xmath448 of the bcg .",
    "we also take note of radio sources within @xmath449 of our cluster positions since these could potentially bias the cluster sz signal .",

    "finally we find one unidentified bright x - ray source from the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) @xcite that is coincident with one of our clusters .",
    "it is interesting to note that although we recover two of the sze - selected clusters from the first spt results @xcite , there are two others from that study which we do not recover .",
    "one of these ( spt - cl 0509@xmath765342 ) falls below the mass threshold used here with mass estimates of @xmath450 and @xmath451 for 200 and 200 respectively .",
    "these are lower than the optical mass quoted in @xcite due to the change in the @xcite mass parametrization but still are comparable to the weak lensing mass range , @xmath452 , obtained by @xcite using the same optical dataset .",
    "the other cluster ( spt - cl0547@xmath765345 ) has a photometric redshift of 0.88 @xcite that puts it beyond the redshift threshold ( @xmath453 ) we use here .",
    "we searched for x - ray counterparts to the scs optical clusters using the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) data following the same procedure as in @xcite .",

    "the background - subtracted count rates were converted to x - ray luminosity ( in the 0.52.0 kev band ) assuming a thermal spectrum ( @xmath454 kev ) and the galactic column density of neutral hydrogen appropriate to the source position , using data from the leiden / argentine/ hi bonn survey @xcite .",
    "x - ray masses within an overdensity of 500 times the critical density were then determined using the @xmath455 vs.  @xmath456 scaling relation from @xcite .",
    "these were then converted to an overdensity of 200 with respect to the average density of the universe for comparison to the optically - derived masses using a simple multiplicative scaling factor of 1.77 .",

    "the green points show the average optical and x - ray masses for clusters stacked in three redshift bins ( 0.0 - 0.4 , 0.4 - 0.6 , 0.6 - 0.8 ) ordered from bottom to top , while the red points were stacked in three optical mass bins ( @xmath4593.2@xmath460 , 3.2@xmath461 - 4.5@xmath460 , and @xmath4624.5@xmath461 ) ordered from left to right . , width=336 ]      there are a number of _ xmm - newton _ pointings that overlap with the scs especially in the 23-hr region .",
    "table  [ tab : clustersxmm ] lists all the optical clusters from this study ( tables  [ tab : clustes23hr ] and [ tab : clustes05hr ] ) that are located within the field of view of an archival _ xmm - newton _ pointing ( specifically the following obsids : 0205330301 , 0505380601 , 0505381801 , 0505382201 , and 0505383601 ) . in several cases",
    ", there is an associated x - ray source detected by the pipeline processing system ( pps ) which is run on all _ xmm - newton _ pointings to produce standard results and are provided to the observer . if a pps source exists , we list its i d , the offset in arcseconds between the x - ray source and the optical cluster position and whether or not the pps has flagged the x - ray source are being extended . to determine fluxes and luminosities , we extract spectra from circular regions chosen to maximize the extracted count rate for the extended x - ray sources . for the other sources we use a 1@xmath447 radius circle .",
    "background spectra come from a surrounding annular region with sufficient area to obtain good photon statistics .",
    "the rate , summed over the single pn and both mos detectors , is quoted in column 7 of table  [ tab : clustersxmm ] .",
    "we also used standard _ xmm - newton _ software tools to calculate the instrumental response functions ( i.e. , the arf and rmf files ) for each cluster .",
    "x - ray luminosity values were determined using the extracted spectra and response files assuming a simple source emission model consisting of an absorbed thermal plasma model . for the absorption component we fixed the column density of neutral hydrogen to the galactic value toward the cluster position ( obtained in the same way as for the rass discussed above ) .",
    "three clusters have enough signal that their mean temperatures can be measured ( see below ) ; for the others we assume @xmath454 kev for the luminosity calculation .",
    "the final column lists the cluster mass inferred from the x - ray luminosity as discussed above .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectra constrain the cluster temperatures for and to values of @xmath463 kev and @xmath464 kev , respectively ( errors are at the 68% confidence interval ) , assuming a metal abundance of 0.3 times the solar value .",
    "scso  j051637@xmath76543001 ( abell s0520 ) is a bright cluster that was the target of a specific _ xmm - newton _ program .",
    "our analysis finds a best fit temperature of @xmath465 kev and metal abundance of @xmath466 relative to solar , which are both consistent with previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray masses for these three systems just mentioned agree quite well with the optically - derived masses and , in the case of scso  j051637@xmath76543001 , with the rosat - derived mass as well .",
    "for the three other clusters in the 23hr region in table  [ tab : clustersxmm ] the x - ray masses are all lower than the optical masses by factors of 35 . for the remaining system ( scso  j051613@xmath76542620 )",
    "there is a catastrophic disagreement between the inferred optical and x - ray masses with the x - ray mass being more than an order of magnitude below the optical one .",
    "this is likely due to significant contamination of the optical number counts by cluster members from the nearby , rich system abell s0520 which is also close in redshift ( 0.2952 vs.  0.36 ) .",
    "we have fully processed using an independent custom - built pipeline @xmath467 tb of archival _ griz _ imaging data from the ctio blanco 4-m telescope acquired under the noao large survey program ( 05b-0043 , pi : joe mohr ) , as part of our own southern cosmology survey .",
    "this data volume corresponds to 45 nights of observing over 3 years ( 2005 - 2007 ) and covers 70 deg@xmath4 of the southern sky that has also been fully observed by act and spt .",
    "here we have presented the first results from the full nominal data set , namely a sample of 105 massive , optically - selected galaxy clusters .",
    "future studies will present the properties of lower mass clusters and groups as well as multi - wavelength studies of cluster physics utilizing selected clusters from this sample .",
    "the current sample is limited to systems with optically - derived masses greater than @xmath468 and redshifts less than @xmath469 .",
    "we have chosen this mass limit to be at or below the anticipated mass threshold of act and spt in order to encompass the upcoming significant sze detections .",
    "however we also have a redshift limit which is due to the depth of the imaging and the wavelength coverage of the filter set .",
    "thus we are missing the most interesting massive clusters at high redshift ( @xmath470 ) .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite , the optical data analyzed here can be used to confirm the presence of a cluster when conducting a targeted positional search for a high significance sze candidate .",
    "the recent success of the mm - band wide - survey - area experiments ( act and spt ) in finding new clusters through untargeted sze surveys has been a strong catalyst for our work .",
    "we present this cluster sample to aid in the verification of sze cluster candidates and the characterization of the sze selection function which currently is observationally unexplored .",
    "moreover , we anticipate stacking the act mm - band maps at the positions of optical clusters to detect , statistically , the average sze signal for systems that fall below the act detection threshold for individual sources .    given the large volume of this data set we believe it might be helpful to address other problems in astrophysics ; therefore we plan to make the blanco data products ( i.e. , photometric source catalogs and images ) available to the community in december 2010 at the following url http://scs.rutgers.edu .",
