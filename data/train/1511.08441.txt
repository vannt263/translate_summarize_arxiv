[ fig : artist - view ] ) have been considered and revealed several types of resonances and threshold resonances if the dc currents are calculated as a function of voltages . the independent voltages @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be commensurate or incommensurate . for the realistic case of extended interfaces ,",
    "the existence of two independent josephson frequencies explains the absence of numerically exact results to this nonequilibrium transport problem . yet , a number of new physical effects were obtained theoretically in different limiting cases ( coherent or incoherent limit , ballistic or diffusive ) and in different set - ups ( metallic junctions or quantum dots , two or three interfaces ) .",
    "the starting point was the discovery of what was called `` self - induced shapiro steps '' by cuevas and pothier@xcite .",
    "this work was based on usadel equations for a diffusive normal metal region connected to three superconductors , one of them involving a tunnel contact .",
    "dc resonances in the current were obtained at commensurate voltages .",
    "the analogy with shapiro steps implies a zero - frequency mode - locking of the josephson ac oscillations induced at the two transparent contacts .",
    "this reminds of the phenomenon studied in the @xmath9 in well - separated junctions coupled by a non - mesoscopic environment@xcite .",
    "later on , those resonances were rediscovered independently by freyn _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "a physical interpretation was uncovered in this work @xcite in terms of correlations among cooper pairs in an intermediate virtual state located in the junction , extending within the coherence length in the superconducting leads .",
    "it was shown that these virtual states of cooper pairs lead to entanglement if quantum dots are inserted into the three - terminal josephson junction .",
    "the prototypical case involves opposite bias voltages @xmath10 ( with @xmath8 ) on terminals @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which produces correlations among four fermions due to the exchange between two cooper pairs ( the so - called quartets , see fig .",
    "[ fig : artist - view ] ) .",
    "more generally , correlations among several cooper pairs , coined as `` multipair correlations '' appear for commensurate @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( _ e.g. _ if @xmath11 is a rational fraction ) .",
    "however , correlations among large numbers of cooper pair are damped exponentially if the interfaces are not very transparent , because an additional electron - hole conversion amplitude crossing twice the interfaces is required to incorporate one more pair into a correlated cooper pair cluster .",
    "multipair correlations and related phenomena were explored recently by jonckheere _",
    "et al._@xcite for a double quantum dot connected to three superconductors .",
    "the lowest order quartet mode was understood in terms of splitting two cooper pairs and recombining them in a way that involves an exchange between fermions .",
    "this mechanism leads to a minus sign in the phase dependence of the quartet current and is not captured by the heuristic `` synchronization '' mechanism assumed by the shapiro step analogy ( the phase dependence was not studied in ref . ) .",
    "interestingly , another original process , coined as `` phase - mar '' was discovered @xcite , corresponding to an interference term for multiple andreev reflections ( mars ) , with transport of quasiparticles from one lead to another assisted by phase - sensitive quartets .",
    "two additional classes of threshold resonances have been unveiled by houzet and samuelsson @xcite at the level of the quasiparticle conductance of incoherent mars .",
    "those threshold resonances are interpreted in terms of higher - order mar channels involving all three terminals , which open upon reducing bias voltages . in this case",
    ", the ratio @xmath11 between the bias voltages can be commensurate or incommensurate .    already at equilibrium ,",
    "multiterminal superconducting structures possess striking properties , like andreev states robustly crossing the zero - energy level @xcite .",
    "the potential of such structures is exemplified in an intriguing proposal by riwar _",
    "@xcite : it amounts to producing nontrivial topological effects due to weyl fermions in a four - terminal all - superconducting structure probed with two small incommensurate voltages .",
    "in contrast with all these predictions , very few experiments are presently available . in a pioneering transport experiment@xcite on a three - terminal long diffusive junction ,",
    "clear josephson - like anomalies have been observed at voltages corresponding to quartets emitted by one terminal towards the two others .",
    "more recent shapiro step experiments on the same set - up@xcite confirm the coherent character of these resonances . in such an experiment , the currents ( and the conductance matrix ) are obtained by fixing the voltages @xmath12 .",
    "other experiments are expected in clean systems such as carbon nanotubes or nanowires@xcite defining quantum dots . moreover , besides experiments controlling both voltages @xmath12 , one should envision experiments setting @xmath13 , which results in @xmath14 being a constant of motion . because of the presence of three terminals , the voltage ( @xmath15 ) and the phase ( @xmath16 ) can be taken as two independant variables , and experiments are highly desirable in order to test the dependence of the quartet and mar current with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    yet , modeling such multichannel systems poses a formidable difficulty",
    ". the related work by cuevas and pothier@xcite is numerically exact , but one contact being a tunnel one .",
    "however , how about a situation in which all contacts have similar and intermediate transparency , as in the recent experiment by pfeffer _",
    "et al._@xcite ?",
    "this question calls for treatments having the capability of dealing with this regime of intermediate transparency , which requires a fully nonperturbative approach .",
    "an alternative is to focus on a short disordered junction and use quantum circuit theory@xcite , which is nonperturbative . yet",
    ", this method also raises considerable difficulties for incommensurate voltages .",
    "more generally , it is difficult to obtain _ numerically exact _ results when two incommensurate frequencies and good extended interfaces are involved in the context of superconducting junctions , and this has not been done up to now .",
    "the paper by cuevas _",
    "et al._@xcite on shapiro steps in a one - channel superconducting weak link is one of the rare examples addressing a problem with two independent frequencies in the context of nanoscale superconducting junctions .",
    "it is a general trend in the field of quantum electronics that experiments are controlled by robust effects that , up to now , have never required supercomputers for being uncovered theoretically at the semi - quantitative level .",
    "it is however true that the challenge of the exact solution may provide surprises in connection with nonlinear physics , but experimental relevance of those effects in the context of multiterminal josephson junctions has not been proven at present time . here",
    ", the line of thought is to ignore the effects appearing solely in the exact solution ( _ e.g. _ not captured by the approximation used here ) , which does not prevent us from exploring the exact solution in the future , on the basis of large - scale numerical calculations .",
    "the present paper proposes a kind of `` unified '' but approximate numerical framework for multiterminal josephson junctions , which can be used for any ratio @xmath11 between the voltages ( _ e.g. _ commensurate or incommensurate ) , as a substitute to the unavailable exact solution .",
    "the calculations are based on the so - called hamiltonian approach [ which was developed by cuevas , martn - rodero and levy yeyati@xcite for multiple andreev reflections in a single - channel superconducting weak link ] , and intermediate transparencies are used .",
    "the method is developed for a three - terminal josephson junction with two interfaces having the same intermediate transparency ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure - schema - jonction ] ) .",
    "it takes into account all multiple tunneling processes occurring separately at the interfaces but treats the scattering between interfaces ( non - local processes ) at lowest order , as if the distance between the interfaces was larger than the coherence length at all energies .",
    "notice that this is never strictly true close to the gap edges where the penetration length of virtual quasiparticles becomes infinite .        within this approximation",
    ", all resonances at rational @xmath11 can be captured in a semi - quantitative way , and the mar threshold resonances@xcite are also obtained for irrational @xmath11 .",
    "the method can eventually be generalized to four - terminal structures .",
    "agreement with respect to results established previously @xcite is obtained , and the numerical results are thoroughly discussed on a physical basis , especially in connection with the recent experiment by pfeffer _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "other points of comparison with known behavior will be obtained .",
    "for instance , in agreement with jonckheere _",
    "et al._@xcite , the current - phase relation has the correct sign for the first phase - sensitive resonances . in agreement with the predominance of normal electron transmission over nonlocal andreev reflection in a normal metal - superconductor - normal metal junction ( @xmath17)@xcite , the critical current is larger in absolute value for identical voltages ( direct transfer of pairs from @xmath2 to @xmath3 through @xmath18 , coined as@xcite `` pair cotunneling '' ) than for opposite voltages ( the so - called quartets ,",
    "also called as double nonlocal andreev reflection@xcite ) . in addition ,",
    "deviations from harmonic current - phase relation are stronger for larger interface transparency and higher bias voltage .",
    "this reminds of the results of a blonder - tinkham - klapwijk@xcite calculation for a @xmath19 junction , in which the subgap current increases with voltage at intermediate transparency . an interesting physical result on three - terminal junctions",
    "will conclude our study , regarding the relative magnitude of quartets and multipairs with respect to the mar signal at intermediate transparency .",
    "indeed , the multipair and quartet resonances can have a large `` critical '' current in comparison to the background mar current .",
    "therefore they can have a high visibility compared to the quasiparticle background and lead to a current signal that can be large enough for experimental detection in a voltage - biased measurement , which is compatible with the experiment by pfeffer _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this conclusion raises the question of whether multipair resonances also have high visibility in comparison to quasiparticles in the four - terminal set - up proposed recently by riwar _",

    "[ fig : artist - view ] contains only two @xmath21 junctions . for the latter ,",
    "the separation between interfaces is larger than the superconducting coherence length , which explains why quartets are not visible in the set - up having only two interfaces .",

    "the avaible experimental data obtained in this grenoble experiment @xcite do not strictly speaking correspond to the same conditions as those corresponding to the calculations presented below : the experiment is in the diffusive limit for a long junction , and the geometry is not identical .    in",
    "what follows , the interfaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 are extended ( multichannel ) , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are thus separately connected to @xmath4 , forming a three - terminal josephson junction with only two interfaces@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure - schema - jonction ] ) .",
    "the normal metallic regions @xmath24 and @xmath0 are treated in the short junction limit , and are approximated by a hopping amplitude @xmath25 , taken for simplicity as uniform over the junctions .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are modelled as a collection of independent one - dimensional channels in which the mean - field bcs superconducting gap is supposed to be uniform .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , even for @xmath4 which is macroscopic except in the contact region . a decrease of the gap in @xmath4 , due to proximity effect",

    "the calculation is performed by using as control parameters the voltages @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the phases at the origin of time @xmath30 .",
    "contrarily to two - terminal junctions , these phases play an essential role in dc transport because on a line @xmath31 ( @xmath32 integers ) , they lead to a constant of motion @xmath33 .",

    "the tight - binding hopping amplitude in the bulk of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath34 .",

    "notice that the recent experiment by pfeffer _",
    "@xcite is done with intermediate interface transparencies ( about @xmath40 ) .",
    "we start by investigating the symmetries of the current , in order to demonstrate compatibility of the hamiltonian approach with expectations based on general symmetry arguments @xcite .",

    "[ an introduction to the green s functions calculations is provided in the appendix  [ app : gfs ] ; an analysis of the symmetries of the current is provided in appendix  [ app : sym ] ] .",
    "the strategy is to obtain symmetries for the bare green s function , to be `` transferred '' to the fully dressed advanced and retarded green s functions , and next to the keldysh green s function and to the current .",
    "the conclusion is a confirmation of the arguments by jonckheere _",
    "et al._@xcite that the current originates from two terms with different parities with respect to phase and voltage reversal .",

    "[ sec : theresults ] are mostly below threshold for the appearance of the phase - mar processes corresponding to the other parity @xcite .",
    "a breakdown of perturbation theory in interface transparency for the current already appears at the level of the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk@xcite ( btk ) wavefunction calculation of the andreev reflection current in a normal metal - insulator - superconductor ( @xmath42 ) junction .",
    "it is underlined that the following argument is for a single @xmath42 interface , with a time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "a one - dimensional model of @xmath42 junction is considered now , with a dimensionless interfacial scattering potential @xmath43 , according to the standard btk notation@xcite .",
    "perfectly transparent junctions correspond to @xmath44 , and tunnel contacts to @xmath45 .",
    "an expansion in @xmath46 of the transmission coefficient is carried out now ( namely , a small - transparency expansion ) and , in a second step , the integral over energy of each term of this expansion will be evaluated from @xmath35 to @xmath47 .",
    "this procedure is problematic if @xmath47 becomes larger than the superconducting gap @xmath48 , in which case the gap edge singularity is within the interval of integration over energy @xmath49 . [ in the discussion of the btk calculation , the energy is denoted by @xmath49 as in usual btk calculations .",
    "the symbol @xmath49 has the same meaning as @xmath50 used in the green s function calculations . ]",
    "the btk amplitudes @xcite @xmath51 ( andreev reflection ) and @xmath52 ( normal reflection ) are expanded as follows in @xmath53 , with @xmath45 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the bcs coherence factors for electrons and holes .",

    "divergences are produced in the energy dependence of the spectral current , leading to an expression of the current integrated over energy as the sum of an infinite number of infinite terms , which , eventually , takes the finite value obtained by btk @xcite in the nonperturbative theory .",
    "thus , perturbative expansions of the current produce non physical divergences if the gap edge singularities are included in the energy integration interval .",
    "a similar artifact is present in the forthcoming partially resummed perturbation theory for a three - terminal junction . in this case ,",
    "the exact nonperturbative values of the currents are unreachable , because of far too long times for their computation .",
    "it is emphasized that , because of multichannel effect , even at a multipair resonance ( such as the quartet resonance ) , where only one frequency remains in the calculation , it is not an easy task to obtain the fully nonperturbative value of the current .",
    "on the other hand , the lowest order term turns out to diverge only logarithmically .",
    "this lowest - order term will be shown to behave correctly with respect to physical expectations and to the results established over the last few years for the quartet , multipair@xcite and mar currents @xcite .",
    "the message is that , in practice , partially resummed perturbation theory can be used at lowest order to understand the features of experiments .",
    "the approach relies on the same principle as a previous work by mlin and feinberg@xcite in the context of nonlocal transport in a @xmath17 junction , in connection with a crossover of the nonlocal conductance from negative to positive as interface transparency is increased .",
    "the idea of the method is to solve exactly the structure with two interfaces sufficiently remote so that they can be considered as independent .",
    "then , the current is evaluated as the interfaces are made closer , but still at a distance of the order of a few coherence lengths .",
    "this amounts to make an expansion in the strength of the processes connecting both interfaces , which , technically , relies on an expansion of the current in the number of back - and - forth amplitudes ( _ e.g. _ the nonlocal bare green s functions ) connecting the interfaces .",
    "the technical implementation is more complex in the case of an all - superconducting device , because of the time - dependence of the hamiltonian , but the principle of the calculation is exactly the same .",
    "such perturbation theory in the number of nonlocal green s functions converges well in the work mentioned above @xcite on nonlocal transport in a @xmath17 structure : for applied voltage much smaller than the gap , @xmath61 $ ] is the small parameter in this expansion even at high transparency , where @xmath62 is the separation between interfaces , and @xmath63 is the zero - energy coherence length .",
    "one of the interests of what follows ( going against what may be pessimistically anticipated at first glance ) is to show that physically useful and relevant ( even though not mathematically exact ) information can be extracted from a similar expansion in an all - superconducting set - up .",
    "intermediate transparency will be used , which has the effect of cutting off high - order terms in the tunnel amplitude , except in a spectral window close to the gaps . roughly speaking ,",
    "in the all - superconducting case , the parameter of the perturbative expansion becomes @xmath64 $ ] , which is of order unity if the energy @xmath50 ( with respect to the chemical potential of @xmath4 ) is close to the gap in the energy integral of the phase - sensitive spectral current : the finite - energy coherence length @xmath65 diverges as @xmath66 .",
    "divergences in the superconductor density of states are also present in the gap edge spectral window , which explains why the formal breakdown of perturbation in the number of nonlocal green s function deserves special discussion for the considered all - superconducting structure .",
    "let us underline that this approach is not equivalent to the tunnel approximation for the @xmath4 interface , as used by cuevas and pothier @xcite .",
    "indeed , our calculation treats part of the multiple scattering events at this interface . on the contrary , in ref . , the superconductors @xmath67 are directly coupled in a nonperturbative way through the normal region .    in a more technical language",
    ", each microscopic process contributing to the dc current at order-@xmath68 corresponds to a closed diagram having @xmath68 nonlocal bare green s functions crossing the central superconductor @xmath4 . with this convention ,",
    "the lowest order in partially resummed perturbation theory is order - two in the number of nonlocal green s functions .",
    "the next - order terms is order - four ,  ... the dyson equations provide a perturbation series in the hopping amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "this series in power of @xmath25 will be reordered as a series in the number of nonlocal bare green s functions , taking into account to all orders dressing by `` local '' processes [ _ e.g. _ each of those processes involves only one of the two @xmath69 or @xmath70 interfaces , without coupling to the other ] .",
    "said differently in a more physical picture , at lowest order , an electron - like quasiparticle coming from @xmath2 couples to mars to all orders at the @xmath71 interface .",
    "next , it can experience electron - hole conversion while crossing @xmath4 only once , and finally , the resulting hole - like quasiparticle is subject to mars at the @xmath72 interface before being transmitted into @xmath3 .",
    "combining with a similar processes from @xmath3 to @xmath2 leads to physical picture for the history of the @xmath73 processes contributing to the lowest order - two approximation for the phase - sensitive current at a multipair resonance .",

    "as a first point of comparison for partially resummed perturbation theory , the set of mar threshold resonances discovered by houzet and samuelsson@xcite was recovered for incommensurate voltages ( however , in the phase - coherent case as far as the present calculations are concerned ) .",
    "those threshold resonances correspond to two families associated to the opening of the channels of mars : @xmath76 with @xmath32 and @xmath77 four integers .",
    "the question arises of whether all values of ( @xmath32 ) are accessible within lowest order - two in the number of nonlocal green s functions .",
    "the answer is that a @xmath78 diagram for multipairs can be transformed into a @xmath78 diagram for phase - sensitive mars by adding one extra line .",
    "one easily checks that some multipairs diagrams can be constructed by using only two nonlocal lines .",
    "yet , they involve only two split pairs from @xmath4 , and for higher order processes ( sextets , octets .. ) e.g. if @xmath79 or @xmath80 , the other pairs participating to the multipair correlation are not split but originate from direct andreev reflection at the @xmath24 or @xmath0 interface .",
    "the above considerations show that at lowest order in the nonlocal processes , all values of @xmath78 are expected to be accounted for , however approximately . at higher order ( not treated hereafter ) , two , three or higher numbers of cooper pairs may split , also accompanied by a @xmath78 multipair at both interfaces .",
    "[ fig : colormap - hs ] is a color - plot showing the dependence on @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the nonlocal conductance , the phases being set to zero .",
    "this ensures that the multipair current ( odd in phase ) occurring for commensurate voltages is zero and that the calculated features are solely due to mar quasiparticle transport . with the intermediate transparency used here ( @xmath83 ) , those threshold resonances appear essentially above a voltage range set by the superconducting gap .",
    "the contact transparencies are also intermediate in the recent experiment by pfeffer _",
    "_ on three - terminal metallic structures @xcite .",
    "the result for the mar threshold resonances is thus compatible with the fact that those threshold resonances were not observed at low bias in this work ( due also to inelastic cutoff of high order mar ) . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : colormap - hs ] ( see also the forthcoming fig .  [",

    "this appears to be reminiscent of the possibility of positive cross - correlations of mar currents in a three - terminal all - superconducting hybrid junction @xcite . on the other hand , in a @xmath17 three - terminal junction , the positive nonlocal conductance at small transparency changes into negative nonlocal conductance at high transparency @xcite , suggesting that , at an oversimplified level ignoring the condensates while retaining only cooper pair splitting , the effective transparency would depend on how remote the voltages are from threshold resonances .",
    "however , this mechanism is not directly relevant to the calculations presented here because , even at the mar threshold resonances , the nonlocal conductance per channel is weak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : colormap - hs ] ) , thus with underlying microscopic processes operating in the perturbative regime .",

    "<S> made of two neighboring interfaces ( with intermediate transparency ) connected by a central superconductor , tunneling through each of the interfaces separately is taken into account to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , nonlocal processes connecting the two interfaces are accounted for at the lowest relevant order . </S>",
    "<S> this yields logarithmically divergent contributions at the gap edges , which are sufficient as a semi - quantitative description . </S>",
    "<S> the method is able to describe the current in the full two - dimensional voltage range , including commensurate as well as incommensurate values . </S>",
    "<S> the results found for the multipair ( for instance quartet ) current - phase characteristics as well as the mar thresholds are compatible with previous results . at intermediate transparency , </S>",
    "<S> the multipair critical current is much larger than the background mar current , which supports an experimental observation of the quartet and multipair resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the paper provides a proof of principle for addressing in the future the interplay between quasiparticles and multipairs in four - terminal structures .     and @xmath0 are two short metallic regions , small compared to the bcs coherence length  @xmath1 . [ </S>",
