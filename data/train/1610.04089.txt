    "we use human cell division rate , which is similar to mouse , to develop a model for cell dynamics of colon and intestinal crypts . because of the lack of data for human crypts , we use the mouse experimental observations to develop the model .",
    "the model indicates that the probability of the progeny of one disadvantageous mutant , like p53@xmath1 , stem cell taking over the entire normal crypt is small , but if it happens it occurs fast ( @xmath2 month ) .",
    "the probability of one advantageous mutant , like apc@xmath3 , stem cell s progeny taking over the entire crypt is high , but it is a slow process ( it needs @xmath4 days ) . if central stem cells ( cescs ) are wild - type , then non - immortal mutants will be washed out in @xmath5 days .",
    "although a single wild - type cesc is able to wash out all p53@xmath1 mutants with a probability of @xmath6 in two months , it is unable to sweep out all apc@xmath3 mutants .",
    "at least two normal cescs are required to wash out all apc@xmath3 mutants . in agreement with experimental observations ,",
    "the model completely captures cell dynamics in the mouse intestinal crypt .",
    "if human crypts contain two stem cell groups like mouse crypts , then the results are also valid for human crypts .",
    "colon cancer is the second and third most common cancer respectively in women and men all over the world [ 4 ] . in most colorectal cancers , mutation occurs over the patient s lifetime , and it is not inherited .",
    "the most frequent mutation in colon cancer is the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) [ 5 ] .",
    "moreover , the absence of apc immediately perturbs wnt , which causes aberrant migration [ 6 ] .",
    "another tumor suppressor gene that becomes inactivated in many cancers as well as in some colon cancers is p53 .",
    "there is evidence that p53 inactivation leads to multiple mutations during a single cell cycle , like chromothripsis [ 7 ] .",
    "chromothripsis is a massive genomic rearrangement occurring only on a single chromosome or a few chromosomes during a single cell cycle [ 8 ] .",
    "moreover , in the majority of colorectal carcinomas , the loss of a large portion of chromosomes 17p and 18q has been observed [ 9 ] .",
    "these massive changes on the cell s genomes can evolve the cell to become immortal like the hela cell line [ 10 ] .",
    "in addition , the over - expression of polycomb ring finger oncogene bmi1 transforms epithelial cells and influences telomerase functionality that can lead to cell immortalization [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "telomeres , repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of all chromosomes , get slightly shorter with each normal cell division until they shorten to a critical length .",
    "this leads to cell aging and ultimately to apoptosis , or cell death [ 58 ] .",
    "normal cells have a maximum number of divisions , i.e. hayflick limit , before these telomeres are depleted .",
    "rare mutations or transformation events , highly associated with telomerase activity , allow cells to scape from the first mortality phase checkpoint ( m1 or hayflick limit ) and the second m2 crisis checkpoint and become immortal [ 53 ] .",
    "the majority of cancer cell lines and cancer biopsies contain telomerase activity or evidence of alternative mechanism for lengthening of telomeres ( alt ) , thus targeting telomerase becomes an attractive anti - cancer therapeutic option [ 54 ] .",
    "the death rate of the immortal cells in the normal homeostasis is almost zero in the time ",
    "scale of tumorigenesis , and they are resistant to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ 14,15 ] . moreover , the metastatic potential of immortal cells is higher compered to the normal epithelial cells [ 11 ] .",
    "immortal cells might be the result of dedifferentiation from non - stem cells to cancer stem - like cells through bidirectional conversions in stroma .",
    "cancer stem - like cells can only exhibit symmetric divisions and presumably acquire the ability of metastasis as an aggressive malignancy [ 12 ] .",
    "the cancer stem cell hypothesis is one of the two established mechanisms in carcinogenesis where the main focus is on internal heterogeneity of cells within the population [ 12 ] . as stem cells in the colonic or intestinal crypt",
    "generate all epithelial cells of the crypt through a cellular hierarchy , the cancer stem cell hypothesis can be a convenient approach to investigate the development of cancer .",
    "although there are debates about the concept of cancer stem cells , there is no doubt on the existence of immortal cells [ 16 ] .",
    "therefore , we develop a general model that is able to accommodate possible immortal cells , which never die in the model , to grow within the progenitor or fully differentiated cell compartments . upgrading the existing models with mutational events and spatial structures [ 17 - 25 ] the general and relevant mechanism in colorectal / intestinal cancer",
    "will be studied in this paper .",
    "more precisely , we model the cell dynamics of the intestinal crypt based on the available experimental data sets .",
    "we investigate the spread of one initial mutant at different locations within the crypt .",
    "furthermore , the proposed model accommodates the possibility that a mutant cell becomes immortal in a single cell division . in this model , we vary the fitness of mutants , which defines the probability that a mutant cell divides and replaces its neighbor cells .",
    "we assume that the fitness of all w.t .",
    "cells is 1 , and the relative fitness of mutants is @xmath7 . in other words , when there are @xmath8 mutants and @xmath9 w.t .",
    "cells competing to divide and fill out the available empty space , the probability that a mutant cell divides is @xmath10 .",
    "recently , the probability @xmath11 that a mutant stem cell replaces its neighbor for various mutants was empirically obtained [ 26 ] .",
    "based on this mouse experiment , the fitness of mutant apc@xmath12 is 1.6 , while the fitness of mutant apc@xmath3 is 3.8 .",
    "moreover , the fitness of the dominant - negative hotspot p53@xmath13 mutant , which corresponds to the human hotspot p53@xmath1 , has been obtained .",
    "the p53@xmath13 protein has been shown to inhibit the w.t .",
    "p53 function , and tumors expressing p53@xmath13 are more metastatic than tumors deleted for p53 [ 27 ] .",
    "surprisingly , the fitness of p53@xmath13 mutants is @xmath14 in the normal colon , while the fitness of the p53@xmath13 mutant is @xmath15 in the inflammatory environment .",
    "thus , we consider a range of fitness values for @xmath7 such that the mutants can be disadvantageous ( @xmath16 ) , neutral ( @xmath17 ) , or advantageous ( @xmath18 ) compared to w.t",
    "we consider the expansion of mutant or marked cells presented at the initial time of simulations . for simplicity , we assume all mutants in the tissue have the same fitness @xmath7 .",
    "we also assume that when a mutant cell divides , one of its children is immortal with a very small probability .",
    "several computational models have been developed to study the dynamics of multistage carcinogenesis [ 28 - 35 ] .",
    "moreover , there are many computational and mathematical models investigating crypt cell dynamics [ 36 - 42 ] .",
    "however , there are several recent experimental studies on animal colon / intestinal crypts that reveal new information about the cell dynamics .",
    "therefore , new mathematical models are required to accommodate the latest experimental discoveries .",
    "note , because of the inability to use the cell fate mapping experimental techniques in humans , the available data for the human colon / intestinal crypt cell dynamics is very limited .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain more realistic computational models for humans , we need to incorporate the available observed data from animal studies .",
    "many cell dynamics models designed for the intestinal and colon crypts , because of their fairly simple cell dynamics comparing to the other tissues , i.e one directional movement from bottom to the top of the crypt [ 50 ] .",
    "the cell dynamics of the intestinal crypt are very similar to the colon crypt .",
    "one of the first models is a homogenous model developed in 1992 to obtain cell division rates at each location of human crypts as well as cell cycles [ 46 ] . the time and probability of the progeny of neutral stem cells taking over the stem cell niche and the entire normal intestinal crypts",
    "have been modeled in [ 50 ] .",
    "this stochastic model , which treats all stem cells as one stem cell type , is in perfect agreement with their experimental data , and it predicts stem cells mostly divide symmetrically .",
    "bravo et al .",
    "[ 41 ] also provided an agent - based computer simulations for cell dynamics in normal human colon crypts .",
    "although there are many mathematical models for cell dynamics of normal crypts , several models have been designed to investigate the process of mutants production and their dynamics .",
    "zhao and michor [ 51 ] developed a one - dimensional homogeneous model , which includes only one column of cells , to track mutants in the crypt .",
    "they found that most divisions should occur at the bottom of the crypt in order to maximize the time to cancer .",
    "in contrast , a recent two - dimensional model , which only contains two columns of cells , shows that most divisions should occur at the top of the crypt to delay cancer [ 52 ] . in [ 51 ] , at each time step , a cell at position @xmath9 is selected to divide , two daughter cells are then placed into positions @xmath9 and @xmath19 , causing cells that previously resided in positions @xmath19 to shift by one position toward the top of the crypt .",
    "the difference , which accounts for the discrepancy between the results of [ 51 ] and [ 52 ] , is that the model developed by shahriyari et al . [",
    "52 ] considers the probability of two - hit mutant production from wild type cells . instead ,",
    "[ 51 ] starts with an apc@xmath12 mutation ( a 1-hit mutant ) at a given position and calculate the time to produce a apc@xmath3 mutation ( a 2-hit mutant ) .",
    "the predictions of [ 51 ] agree with [ 52 ] when they consider the probability of second mutation production conditioning on the existence of 1-hit mutants .",
    "additionally , mirams et al . [ 39 ] developed a computer model for cell dynamics of colonic crypts to obtain the probability of mutants taking over or washing out from the crypt . in this model ,",
    "cells are defined by the location of their centers , and cell movement was determined by assuming that each cell exerts a linear spring force on its neighbors .",
    "they used an equation of motion to determine the centre of each cell at each time .",
    "tissue cells as well as colon and intestinal cells are commonly divided in three categories ; stem cells ( scs ) , transit amplifying ( ta ) , and fully differentiated cells ( fd ) .",
    "colonic and intestinal stem cells , which are located at the bottom of the crypt , generate themselves and ta cells .",
    "ta cells , which are the most dividing cells in the crypt , give rise to the specialized differentiated cells that fulfill the physiological functions of the intestine [ 3 ] .",
    "sometimes in the response to an injury , ta cells that have some potential characteristics of stem cells can re - obtain some stem cells activities to regenerate the crypt [ 3 ] . here , we do not model this scenario , because we investigate normal cell dynamics of crypts with no injuries .",
    "recently , it has been observed that the intestinal crypts contain two stem cell compartments : border stem cells ( bscs ) and central stem cells ( cescs ) [ 24 ] .",
    "bscs , which are located between cescs and transit amplifying ( ta ) cells , have high potential for differentiation ; in contrast , the cescs , which are located at the very bottom of the crypt , are biased towards proliferation .",
    "the first computational cell dynamics model , which considered the existence of two stem cells groups , was developed by shahriyari et al . [ 47 ] to obtain the probability of second - hit mutant production in the stem cell niche . here , by generalizing that model",
    ", we develop a unique 4-compartmental stochastic model for the colon and intestinal crypt , which incorporates new discoveries ; the existence of two stem cell groups . at the initial time of simulations , we place mutant / marked cells at one of these compartments and we calculate the probability and the time that their progeny take over the crypt or are washed out from the crypt .",
    "the results of our model are in complete agreement with the experimental data obtained by snippert et al .",
    "[ 50 ] and ritsma et al .",
    "we obtain the values of the model s parameters from available published experimental data sets .",
    "remarkably , we find that if only cescs are w.t .",
    "and all other cells in the crypt are mutants ( but not immortal ) , then in less than hundred days , all mutants are washed out from the crypt .",
    "these results suggest that if we want to change the fate of the crypt , we only need to alter the central stem cells .",
    "moran model and branching process have been widely used to study fixation probabilities and time to fixations in compartmental models [ 32 ] . here , we use moran process to model cell dynamics of the colon and intestinal crypts , because the number of cells in the crypt stays approximately constant . in the moran models ,",
    "the total number of cells remains constant at each updating time step . in most homogeneous moran models , which include only one type of cells",
    ", it has been assumed that at each updating time step one cell dies and one cell divides .",
    "however , in order to model stem cells symmetric divisions , some non - homogeneous moran models assume two cell deaths coupled with two divisions [ 52 ] . here",
    ", we consider a 4-compartmental stochastic model for the tissue architecture .",
    "this model consists of one compartment for ta cells @xmath20 and one compartment for fd cells @xmath21 , and two stem cell ( sc ) groups @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding to bscs and cescs , respectively .",
    "we assume at each updating time step , two fd cells die and two cells divide based on their fitness .",
    "if stem cells divide with probability @xmath24 the division is symmetric and with probability @xmath25 is asymmetric .",
    "asymmetric stem cells divisions can only occur at the @xmath22 compartment .",
    "there are two types of symmetric stem cell division ; proliferation ( newborn cells are two stem cells ) and differentiation ( newborn cells are two ta cells ) . in this model ,",
    "differentiation only happens in the @xmath22 compartment , because it is close to the ta cells",
    ". however , with probability @xmath26 , proliferation happens in the @xmath23 compartment and with probability @xmath27 it happens at the @xmath22 compartment .",
    "if it occurs at the @xmath23 group then one random stem cell from the @xmath23 compartment migrates to the @xmath22 .",
    "we denote the total number of non - stem cells by @xmath28 , the total number of stem cells by @xmath29 , and the total number of cells by @xmath30 . in summary , at each updating time step two fd cells die and two divisions occur based on the following algorithm :    * with probability @xmath31 , two fd cells divide . or , * with probability 1-@xmath31 , one ta cell differentiates to two fds , and one of the following scenarios happens .",
    "* * with probability @xmath32 , one @xmath20 cell proliferates to replace the differentiated @xmath20 cell . or",
    "* * with probability @xmath33 , one stem cell divides according to one of the following steps : * * * with probability @xmath25 , the division occurs in the @xmath22 asymmetrically , i.e. a @xmath34 cell is generated . or *",
    "* * with probability @xmath24 the division is symmetric . with probability @xmath35",
    "this symmetric division is differentiation and happens in the @xmath22 group , and with probability @xmath36 is proliferation ( @xmath37 is the initial total number of scs ) .",
    "if it is proliferation then with probability @xmath26 , it happens at the @xmath23 and with probability @xmath27 it occurs at the @xmath22 .",
    "if it occurs at the @xmath23 group , then one random cell from the @xmath23 migrates to the @xmath22 .",
    "also , if the proliferation occurs at the @xmath22 group , with probability @xmath38 one random cell from the @xmath22 migrates to the @xmath23 , and then one random cell from the @xmath23 migrates to the @xmath22 to keep the number of cells at each compartment approximately constant .    in this model",
    ", the total number of cells stays constant .",
    "however , because of the definition of the function @xmath39 , the number of stem cells varies , but its variation is very small .",
    "the function @xmath39 is a feedback function , which controls the rate of stem cells differentiation and proliferation .",
    "it does not let all stem cells differentiate and their number goes to zero , or massively proliferate and their number becomes very high .",
    "more precisely , when the number of stem cells becomes less than the initial number of stem cells , then delta , the probability of stem cell differentiation , becomes very small to increase the probability of proliferation .",
    "when the number of stem cells is higher than the initial number of stem cells , then @xmath39 becomes very high to increase the probability of stem cell differentiation . since @xmath39 keeps the number of stem cells at each time point approximately the same as the initial number of stem cells ( @xmath40 ) , in calculations we can assume @xmath41 .",
    "the model also includes the possibility of migration from the border stem cells to the central stem cell compartment . in the model ,",
    "when a border stem cell proliferates with probability @xmath38 one random bsc migrates to the @xmath23 , and then one random central stem cell migrates to the @xmath22 . in other words ,",
    "when a bsc migrates to the @xmath23 , it shifts a cesc cell to the border stem cell compartment . in order to keep the number of bscs more than zero and having approximately constant number of cesc",
    ", one cesc must migrates to the @xmath22 when a migration occurs from the @xmath22 group to the @xmath23 .    we assume , if a mutant divides , then its newborn children are mutants .",
    "when one mutant non - stem cell divides , one of its children becomes immortal with probability @xmath42 . at each updating time step ,",
    "two fd cells are chosen to die . in the model ,",
    "the progeny of immortal cells are never chosen to die . therefore",
    ", immortal cells will never be washed out from the crypt .    in general , cescs can only proliferate , and bscs are able to proliferate , differentiate , and divide asymmetrically .",
    "ta cells are able to both proliferate and differentiate , and fd cells only able to proliferate . also for simplicity ,",
    "death only happens in the fd compartment .",
    "a summary of the model is given in fig .",
    "the details of methods and calculations are provided in the supplementary materials .",
    "the number of studies on the human colon crypt s cell dynamics is very limited .",
    "however , there are some works on inferring the parameters for human colon crypts [ 43,44 ] , as well as measurement of in vivo proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu labeling ) [ 45 ] .",
    "these experiments show that there are approximately 2000 cells in each human colon crypt , and the height of the crypt is around 80 cells [ 45 ] .",
    "it has been estimated that there are 5 - 6 stem cells at the bottom of the human colon crypt [ 44 ] . additionally ,",
    "most divisions happen in the lower part of the crypt ; cells at positions 10 - 50 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , where 0 is the bottom of the crypt [ 45 ] .",
    "colonic crypts have the same spatial organization of cell types ( stem cells , transient amplifying cells , and differentiated cells ) as intestinal crypts .",
    "in addition , cell dynamics of the intestinal crypt are very similar to the colon crypt . however , at the top of the colonic crypt , the fd cells are shed into the lumen and transported away , whereas cells at the top of the intestinal crypt move up to a villus and are removed at the top of the villus .",
    "furthermore , mouse crypts contain all three cell compartments ( stem cells , transient amplifying cells , and differentiated cells ) in the same order as human crypts , with 5 - 7 stem cells [ 26 ] .",
    "the division rate of cells at each of these three cell compartments is very similar in mouse and human crypts [ 1 - 3 ] . in summary ,",
    "cell dynamics of human colonic and intestinal crypts are very similar to mouse colonic and intestinal crypts .    in order to calculate the division probabilities at each compartments ( fd , ta , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) , we normalize the division rates experimentally obtained in [ 46 ] . we find a function , which fits the normalized division rates of cells at each location @xmath43 in the human crypt , @xmath44/881.4 $ ] .",
    "we count cells at positions 70 - 80 as fd cells , therefore the probability that a division occurs in the fd compartment is given by @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , each crypt contains around 6 actively diving stem cells [ 1 ] , they divide once every 2 - 3 days [ 46 ] .",
    "hence , we assume cells at the locations 0 - 5 are stem cells , and ta cells are cells at the locations 6 - 69 .",
    "thus , the probability that a division occurs at the stem cell niche when fd cells do not replace two dead fd cells is @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , in this model the division probability of cescs is given by @xmath47 .",
    "according to ritsma et al . [ 24 ] , cells at the locations 0 - 2 belong to the cesc group . since the probability that a division occurs in the cescs is more than zero [ 24 ] , thus @xmath48 .",
    "in our model , @xmath39 is approximately 0.5 , hence @xmath49 . since @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ", we conclude @xmath24 and @xmath26 are greater than @xmath52 , which is in perfect agreement with the results obtained in [ 50 ] .",
    "following the same technique , we also find the models parameters for mouse intestinal crypts .",
    "we use the experimental data for the rate of cell divisions at each location of the mouse crypt , which is provided in [ 37 ] .",
    "the function @xmath53/ 11.3292255981 $ ] fits the normalized division rates of cells at each location @xmath43 in the mouse intestinal crypt ( see fig .",
    "the length of the mouse intestinal crypt is approximately 25 cells .",
    "we count cells at the positions 20 - 25 as fd cells , thus @xmath54 .",
    "we also assume cells at the positions 0 - 5 are stem cells , and cells at the locations 6 - 19 are ta cells .",
    "then , like before we get @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we also vary @xmath38 , which is the probability of migration from @xmath22 to @xmath23 when a bsc proliferates , between zero and 0.5 , because the experimental observations show a small number of migrations from border stem cells to central stem cells [ 24 ] .",
    "the parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we use the parameters that we obtained for the mouse intestinal crypts to test the model .",
    "2 shows a perfect agreement between the results of simulations and the results of experimental observations provided in [ 24 ] .",
    "this stochastic model , for the fist time incorporates the existence of two stem cell groups and the migration from the border stem cell compartment to the central stem cells to track mutants in the crypt . for this reason ,",
    "this model is able to describe the biological reality better than previously published models that treated all stem cells equally .",
    ".model parameters calculated using experimental data provided in [ 24,46 ] and [ 37 ] . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the analytical methods reveal that the probability of the progeny of @xmath57 number of mutated / marked cesc taking over the @xmath23 compartment is given by @xmath58 when no migration occurs from @xmath22 to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the fitness of mutants and @xmath23 is the total number of cescs ( see si part for the details of the calculations ) .",
    "this formula shows that the probability of the fixation in the cesc depends only on the fitness of mutants , the number of cesc mutants , and the total number of cescs .    from the definition of fitness , cells with high fitness",
    "have high proliferation rate as well as high differentiation rate . as a result , the fixation probability of advantageous cesc mutants is higher than disadvantageous mutants , however their fixation time is also higher than disadvantageous ones ( fig .",
    "4(a - c ) ) . since",
    "advantageous mutants differentiate faster than disadvantageous ones , they need more time to take over the crypt .",
    "these results do not change when cells are able to migrate from border stem cell compartment to the central stem cells ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . additionally , if the progeny of mutant cescs take over the fd compartment , its average occurrence time is less than 100 days ( fig .",
    "if stem cells divide only asymmetrically ( i.e. @xmath61 ) , then no division happens at the cesc compartment , thus cesc mutants never divide .",
    "in other words , if stem cells divide fully asymmetrically then the probability that a mutant cesc spreads to any other compartment is zero .",
    "the same scenario would occur , when the proliferation probability in the @xmath23 is zero , i.e. @xmath62 .      the analytical calculations show that the probability of the progeny of @xmath63 number of bscs taking over the entire bsc is given by @xmath64 when there is no migration from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , where @xmath26 is the proliferation probability of cescs when stem cells divide symmetrically .",
    "this formula indicates that the probability of the fixation in the bsc depends only on @xmath39 , @xmath26 , the number of bsc mutants , and the total number of bscs when there is no migration from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this formula and the simulations imply that the probability that the progeny of one bsc will spread over the entire bsc is almost zero , because according to the parameter estimations @xmath39 is approximately half , and @xmath26 is between @xmath52 and one . additionally , the progeny of bscs are always washed out from the crypt regardless of their fitness when there is no immortal cell .",
    "if at least half of bscs are mutants , then they might have a small chance to colonize and take over the entire bsc compartment .",
    "if this rare event happens , it occurs in one day ( fig .",
    "4(d),(e),(f ) ) .",
    "however , several days later the progeny of cescs will replace all mutant bscs , and eventually the progeny of mutant bscs are washed out from the crypt .",
    "although we expect a higher proliferation probability in the bsc compartment ( i.e. smaller @xmath26 ) to lead to a higher fixation probability in the bsc group , it does not increase the fixation probability @xmath66 very much .",
    "the reason is each proliferation is coupled with one differentiation .",
    "the differentiation of scs increases the chance of transporting mutants from the stem cell niche to the ta group .",
    "additionally , advantageous mutants disappear faster from the @xmath22 than disadvantageous ones .",
    "this result is in agreement with the result of the experiments done by ritsma et al . [",
    "24 ] , where they observed that the probability of a bsc colonization is very small .",
    "experimental data shows that fd cells do not divide much compared to ta cells .",
    "if fd cells do not divide at all ( @xmath67 ) , then non - immortal fd mutants are always removed from the crypt . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath68 and no immortal cell is generated in the system , the probability @xmath69 that the progeny of one fd mutant will take over the whole fd is very small ( fig .",
    "5(b),(c ) ) ; however , it is much higher than the probability of one ta cell s progeny taking over the ta compartment , @xmath70 . when the rate of divisions in @xmath20 is approximately zero ( it rarely occurs in reality ) , then @xmath71 . if division rate in stem cells is small but non  zero while that for @xmath20 is high , which corresponds to the experimental observations , then the probability of one ta mutant s progeny taking over the ta compartment decreases when the mutants fitness @xmath7 increases ( fig .",
    "5(e),(f ) ) .",
    "this means that ta cells are more capable of producing fd cells than being fixated . in the extreme scenario , when no divisions happen in scs ( @xmath72 )",
    ", then @xmath70 is @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , when no proliferation in @xmath20 is permitted and ta cells only differentiate , i.e. @xmath74 , then @xmath75 is zero .",
    "note , when ta cells are only able to differentiate but not proliferate , mutants differentiate to two fd mutants ( and thus extinct ) , therefore mutants will be removed from the ta compartment ( fig .",
    "5(e),(f ) ) .",
    "we also study the probability of a ta mutant s progeny taking over the fd compartment . in the human colon crypt , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 based on the parameter estimations , the probability of one ta or fd cell s progeny taking over the entire fd or ta compartment",
    "is approximately zero .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that although ta mutants generate fd mutants , the generated fd mutants are washed out from the crypt , before they get a chance to colonize .",
    "interestingly , mutants with high fitness will be removed from the crypt quickly , because most divisions occur in the ta compartment , and advantageous ta mutants quickly differentiate to two fd cells .",
    "the results of simulations reveal that with probability more than 0.99 , the progeny of cescs will take over the entire human colon crypt in less than three months . in other words , if all stem cells are wild - type , while the rest of the cells in the crypt are mutants , then all crypt cells become wild - type in less than 100 days .",
    "unexpectedly , the time that the progeny of the cescs need to take over the crypt decreases when the mutants fitness increases : meaning the advantageous mutants are washed out from the crypt faster than disadvantageous ones .",
    "although this result seems strange in the first glance and is different from the results of non - spatial models , it actually makes sense .",
    "advantageous mutants have higher division rates than normal cells , so they will be moved rapidly to the fd compartment , then will be removed from the crypt .",
    "we have not found any experimental data about this result , so it needs to be experimentally validated .    moreover , the probability that the progeny of a single normal stem cell will take over the entire crypt is more than zero . this probability is more than @xmath78 , if mutants are disadvantageous , and it is close to zero if mutants are advantageous .",
    "this implies that if only one of the cescs is wild - type , and the rest of the crypt s cells are @xmath79 mutants , then with a probability of @xmath78 all cells will become wild - type in 1 - 2 months in the non - inflammatory condition . although the probability of w.t .",
    "cells taking over the entire crypt depends on the number of normal cells in the @xmath23 , its time to concurrence does not depend on the number of wild - type cescs ( fig .",
    "if stem cells divide fully asymmetrically ( @xmath61 ) , then no division occurs in the cesc compartment .",
    "therefore , in this case cescs will not take over the crypt . moreover , the time that the progeny of cescs need to take over the entire crypt is a decreasing function of @xmath24 . in other words , if stem cell divisions are mostly symmetric , then cescs progeny will rapidly spread over the crypt . in addition , the probability @xmath26 , which is the probability that a cesc divides in the case of symmetric division , is not as important as the fitness of mutants @xmath60 .",
    "some environmental conditions or genetic / epigenetic changes lead to creation of an immortal cell in the ta compartment . therefore , here",
    "we investigate the dynamics of potential immortal cells in the crypt .",
    "we observe that the immortal ta cells have higher tendency to differentiate and generate more immortal fd cells than spreading over the ta compartment .",
    "moreover , the progeny of even a single immortal ta or fd cell will spread over the entire fd in less than 70 days .",
    "expectedly , the advantageous immortals spread faster than disadvantageous ones .",
    "our 4-compartmental model can be easily modified as a 3-compartmental model with only one stem cell group by assuming there is no cescs ( @xmath80 ) and the probability of division in cescs @xmath26 is zero .",
    "8 shows that the probability that the progeny of one mutant stem cell will take over the fd compartment is small ( between 0.01 and 0.14 ) in the one stem cell compartment model .",
    "however , this probability is zero for the progeny of a mutant bsc in the 4-compartmental model .    in the 4-compartmental model , if a mutant appears in the cescs , with a high probability it stays in the crypt , and its progeny will take over the entire crypt especially for advantageous mutants .",
    "however , in the 3-compartmental model , the possibility that an advantageous mutant stem cell differentiates to two ta cells and is removed from the crypt is high .",
    "this result may suggest the existence of only one stem cell compartment is an advantage , however if half of scs become mutants , then mutants take over the entire crypt with a high probability in the 3-compartmental model . in the 4-compartmental model ,",
    "if all bscs are mutants ( more than half of scs ) and all cescs are wild - type , then mutants will be washed out from the crypt in less than 3 months .",
    "furthermore , in the work done by shahriyari et al .",
    "[ 52 ] , it has been shown that the bi - compartmental stem cell niche delays the mutants generation .      comparing the results of simulations and",
    "the experimental observation shows that the best value for the probability of migration from bsc to cesc , when a border stem cell proliferates , is @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "simulations and analytical calculations show that the results are almost insensitive to @xmath38 when @xmath38 is between zero and @xmath82 ( see fig . 7 and 8) .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath65 and central stem cells are normal , then the probability of washing out mutants is one .",
    "however , when @xmath81 , this probability is around @xmath83 for @xmath84 . the results for higher range of @xmath38 have been shown in the supplementary part .",
    "border stem cells mostly differentiate , and the proliferation of stem cells mostly occur in the @xmath23 compartment . therefore , with a very high probability , mutant bscs differentiate and move to the ta compartment specially if mutants have a high fitness .",
    "however , the disadvantageous bsc mutants have a small chance to proliferate and move to the cesc compartment , but their survival chance is very small because of their small fitness .",
    "this phenomena causes that the probability of bsc mutants taking over bsc or the entire crypt becomes very small and almost insensitive to @xmath38 ( see fig . 8) .",
    "the absence of apc , which causes aberrant migration [ 5,6 ] , is the most frequent mutation in colon cancer [ 5 ] .",
    "if all cells in one compartment lose their apc , then a tumor initiates because cells located lower than this compartment can not migrate to the top of the crypt . for this reason",
    ", we calculate the probability that mutants are fixated at each of the compartments . the simulations and analytical calculations , which are in perfect agreement ,",
    "show that the progeny of one non - stem non - immortal cell regardless of its fitness are not able to take over any compartment .",
    "however , the progeny of one immortal neutral fd cell will take over the entire fd in less than one month .",
    "the model shows that the time that the progeny of neutral stem cells need to take over the entire normal crypt is around 60 days , which is in perfect agreement with the experimental observations [ 50 ] .",
    "snippert et al .",
    "[ 50 ] found that the progeny of stem cells are taking over the entire normal intestinal crypts in two months .",
    "our model also indicates that when all central stem cells are normal and there is no immortal cell , mutants will be washed out from the crypt with probability more than 0.99 .",
    "furthermore , it shows that a single normal central stem cell has a chance to sweep out all mutants from the crypt when there is no immortal cell .",
    "the model suggests that only cescs are able to take over the entire crypt , and they are able to renew the cesc compartment in less than 2 days , and the whole crypt in less than 3 months .",
    "this result is in agreement with the results of the computer simulations for colonic crypt provided in [ 39 ] .",
    "they did simulations for a list of chosen parameters values , which were not obtained based on biological observations .",
    "when there is no mathematical calculations , we can not completely trust the results , because the results might be different for other parameters values .",
    "moreover , their model consists of only one cell type and does not consider different type of divisions , like stem cells symmetric and asymmetric divisions .",
    "their model , which only obtains the location of cells after each division following a physical rule , predicts that mutants located more than one to two cells from the base of the crypt are unlikely to take over the entire crypt .",
    "although the fitness of cescs does not make much difference in their fixation time in the cesc compartment , it affects the time that they need to take over the entire crypt .",
    "the disadvantageous mutants take over the crypt quickly , but the probability of this occurrence is small .",
    "for example , the probability of one disadvantageous cesc mutant s progeny like p53@xmath13 , which has a fitness of @xmath14 , taking over the fd compartment is @xmath0 in the non - inflammatory environment .",
    "however , if the progeny of a disadvantageous cesc mutant take over the fd compartment , they will spread over the entire fd in less than one month .",
    "moreover , the probability of the progeny of one cesc apc@xmath3 mutant , which has a fitness of @xmath85 , taking over the fd is @xmath86 .",
    "importantly , they need at least 40 days to spread over the entire fd compartment ( fig .",
    "we conclude the probability of the progeny of the cesc mutants with lower fitness , like p53@xmath13 mutants , taking over over the crypt is small , but if it happens it is a fast process .",
    "additionally , the probability of the progeny of the cesc mutants with high fitness , like apc@xmath3 mutants , taking over the crypt is high , but it is a slow process .    in summary , analytic calculations and numerical simulations , which confirm the existing experimental data , show a high level of dependency on central stem cells for cell dynamics of colon and intestinal crypt . in the absence of immortal cells , a normal central stem cell compartment will sweep out all mutants from the crypt ; substituting mutant stem cells in the niche with the wild - type cells will cure the crypt . therefore , the model suggests that stem cell therapies can be a potential treatment or preventing option for intestinal and colon cancer when there is no immortal cells .",
    "recently , there have been many studies implementing stem cell therapy for various diseases including cancers [ 57 ] .",
    "most of the procedures involve local administration or direct injection of stem cells [ 55 ] .",
    "an in vivo study has revealed that injection of rat umbilical cord stem cells ( ruscs ) can completely abolish rat mammary carcinomas with no evidence of metastasis or recurrence 100 days post - tumor cell inoculation [ 56 ] .",
    "the model predicts that if there are any immortal cells , they will rapidly expand and cause tumor formation.in this case , normal stem cells alone are not able to cure the crypts , and the therapeutic strategies , which are based on transforming immortal cells to mortal ones , are needed .",
    "thus , the failure of some stem cell therapies might be associated with the existence of immortal cells .",
    "there are some studies suggesting that inhibition of telomerase function and experimental induction of telomere shortening can reverse cell immortality and trigger apoptotic cell death [ 53,59 ] .",
    "however , there is an evidence of telomerase activity in some normal tissues such as colon and testis [ 54 ] .",
    "therefore , the future of stem cell therapy depends on understanding each tissue s specific cell types and features as well as its cell dynamics .",
