    "noncollinear magnetism , especially the spin - spiral structures , has received much attention in recent decades , not only for possible magnetism - based technological applications@xcite but also for fundamental physics@xcite . in particular , it was recently reported that spin chirality in geometrically frustrated pyrochlore compounds could generate magnetic monopoles@xcite and also large anomalous hall effect@xcite .",
    "it was also proposed recently that the spin - spiral structure could be the main source of the magnetoelectric effect observed recently in multiferroic oxides.@xcite the spin - spiral structure , in which the magnetization rotates along a certain direction in a bulk material , was observed two decades ago in neutron diffraction experiments on fcc fe and fe@xmath1co@xmath2 alloy precipitates in cu.@xcite this experimental finding has since stimulated many _",
    "ab initio _ studies of the spin - spiral structures in bulk magnets@xcite . indeed ,",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "calculations@xcite corroborated that stable spin - spiral states exist in fcc fe .",
    "furthermore , _ ab initio _ total energy calculations for the spin - spiral structures also helped to formulate an explanation of the anomalous magnetovolume properties of the invar alloys ( the invar effect)@xcite .",
    "noncollinear magnetism in low - dimensional systems has also been studied both theoretically and experimentally in recent years.@xcite for example , mn monolayer on w(001 ) surface was recently investigated@xcite jointly by spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and also _ ab initio _ calculations , and it was concluded that a spin - spiral structure along the ( 110 ) direction exists in this monolayer system . a stable spin - spiral structure with propagation vector @xmath3 = ( 0,0,0.15)(2@xmath4/@xmath5 ) was also predicted to exist in the unsupported freestanding fe(110 ) monolayer with the lattice constant of 3.16 @xcite .",
    "co / copt bilayers were also found to support noncollinear spiral structures by brillouin light scattering@xcite .",
    "interestingly , very recent _ ab initio _ calculations show that in mn chains on ni(001 ) , the magnetic structure could change from non - collinear to collinear ferrimagnetic , depending on whether the number of the mn atoms is even or odd.@xcite    stimulated by possible unusual magnetism in one - dimensional ( 1-d ) systems , we have recently carried out systematic _ ab initio _ studies of the collinear magnetic properties of linear and zigzag atomic chains of all 3@xmath0@xcite , 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0@xcite transition metals .",
    "although the ideal infinite freestanding 3@xmath0 transition metal atomic chain is unstable and can not be prepared experimentally , short suspended monostrand metal nanowires and atomic chains have been prepared in mechanical break junctions.@xcite furthermore , structurally stable co atomic chains have been recently prepared on a vicinal surface of pt(997 ) surface@xcite or inside nanotubes.@xcite therefore , we have also performed _",
    "ab initio _",
    "calculations for the 3@xmath0 transition metal linear atomic chains on the cu(001 ) surface@xcite in order to understand how the substrates would affect the magnetic properties of the nanowires .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study possible spin - spiral structures in all 3@xmath0 transition metal atomic chains by _",
    "ab initio _ calculation of the total energy of the spin - spiral state as a function of propagation wave vector @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , we find that the magnetic ground state in the v , mn and fe chains would be a spin - spiral state .",
    "furthermore , we evaluate the exchange interaction parameters between the atoms and also spin - wave stiffness constants of all the atomic chains considered here from the calculated energy dispersion relations of the spin - spiral waves .",
    "the obtained exchange interaction parameters allow us to understand why the spin - spiral state is stable in the v , mn and fe chains but is not stable in the cr , co and ni chains .",
    "finally , we also estimated the upper limits of the magnetic phase transition temperature for all the atomic chains .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after a brief description of the computational details in sec .",

    "these results show that a stable spin - spiral state exists in the v , mn and fe chains .",

    "iv are the obtained exchange interaction parameters which enable us to understand the stability of the obtained magnetic ground state in each atomic chain considered . in sec .",
    "v , we present the calculated spin - wave stiffness constant and also the estimated magnetic phase transition temperatures for the 3@xmath0 atomic chains .",
    "finally , the band structures of the spin - spiral state of the v and mn chains are displayed in sec .",
    "vi , and a summary of this work is given in sec .",
    "in the present first principles calculations , we use the accurate frozen - core full - potential projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method ,  @xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations are based on density functional theory with the exchange and correlation effects being described by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite . a very large plane - wave cutoff energy of 500 ev is used .",
    "the shallow core 3@xmath6 electrons of the 3@xmath0 transition metals are treated as valence electrons .",
    "we adopt the standard supercell approach to model an isolated atomic chain .",
    "the nearest wire and wire distance adopted here is 20   .",
    "we start with the theoretical equilibrium bond lengths for collinear magnetic states from our previous study of 3@xmath0 tm nanowires.@xcite however , in the fully unconstrained noncollinear magnetic calculations@xcite for the spin spiral structures , we vary the bond length in order to study the bond length dependence of the stability of the spin spiral state .",
    "the @xmath7-centered monkhorst - pack scheme with a @xmath8-mesh of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) in the full brillouin zone ( bz ) , in conjunction with the fermi - dirac - smearing method with @xmath11 ev , is used for the bz integration .",
    "we consider the transverse spin - spiral states where all the spins rotate in a plane perpendicular to the spiral propagation vector * q*. the total energies of the transverse spin - spirals as a function of the magnitude of spin - spiral wave vector @xmath12 are calculated self - consistently by using the generalized bloch condition approach@xcite . to study the exchange interactions ,",
    "we apply the frozen - magnon approach and obtain the exchange interaction parameters by a fourier transformation of the energy spectra of the spin - spiral waves .",
    ".calculated equilibrium bond length @xmath0 , ground state spin - spiral wave vector ( @xmath12 ) and total energy [ @xmath13 [ relative to that of the fm state ( @xmath14 ) ] as well as spin magnetic moment ( @xmath15 ) at @xmath14 in the 3@xmath0 transition metal chains . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabled ]    for comparision , the spin - wave stiffness constants @xmath16s for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) fe , co and ni systems from previous _ ab initio _ calculations and experimental measurements , are also listed in table [ tabled ] .",
    "it is clear from table [ tabled ] that the spin - wave stiffness constant tends to become smaller as the dimensionality of the system gets reduced .",
    "this may be expected ( see eq .",
    "[ spinwaved ] ) because the number of near neighbors becomes smaller as the dimensionality of the system gets reduced . among the three bulk 3@xmath0 elemental ferromagnets , fe has the smallest spin - wave stiffness , and , interestingly , the stiffness of fe becomes negative when its dimensionality is decreased to one ( table [ tabled ] ) .    within the mean - field ( mf ) approximation",
    ", the critical temperature ( @xmath17 ) of the magnetic phase transition for the effective heisenberg hamiltonian can be estimated via the approximate expression@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath3 is the spin - spiral wavevector and @xmath19 is the fourier transform of the interatomic exchange parameters @xmath20 in the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath21)@xcite , @xmath22 using the calculated exchange interaction parameters @xmath23 ( table [ tabled ] and fig .",
    "[ exchangej]a ) , and eqs .",
    "[ transmf ] and [ exjq ] , we estimate the transition temperatures @xmath24 for the 3@xmath0 transition metal chains , as listed in table [ tabled ] .",
    "encouragingly , the ferromagnetic transition temperatures evaluated by using eq .",
    "[ curiefm ] for the co and ni chains are 622 and 444 k , respectively , being in good agreement with that obtained by using eqs .",
    "[ transmf ] and [ exjq ] ( table [ tabled ] ) .",
    "table [ tabled ] indicates that the critical temperature for the 3@xmath0 atomic linear chains considered varies from several tens to a few hundreds of kelvins .",
    "the critical temperatures for the 3@xmath0 atomic chains are much smaller than the corresponding ones for the bulk metals and their monolayers ( table [ tabled ] ) .",
    "this is because of the much reduced coordination numbers in these 1d systems , although the exchange interaction parameters in the atomic chains are generally larger than their counterparts in the bulks and monolayers .",
    "the more accurate expression for the critical temperature within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) also exists@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "the rpa expression generally gives the critical temperatures for bulk ferromagnets fe , co and ni being in better agreement with experiments than the mf expression@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the critical temperatures with the mf approximation are usually significantly higher than that from the rpa calculations.@xcite using our calculated spin - wave dispersion relations ( fig .",
    "2 ) and also the @xmath26 values from ref . , we obtain @xmath27 k for the co chain and @xmath28 for the ni chain . therefore , the estimated critical temperatures listed in table [ tabled ] should be considered only as the upper limits .",
    "finally , we note that in 1-d isotropic heisenberg model with finite - range exchange interactions , there is no spontaneous magnetization at any nonzero temperature because fluctuations become important.@xcite nonetheless , this discouraging conclusion has to be revised in the presence of a magnetic anisotropy and long range interactions . indeed ,",
    "ferromagnetism in 1-d monoatomic co metal chain on a pt substrate has been recently reported.@xcite a detailed discussion on possible finite temperature spontaneous magnetization in 1-d systems has been given in ref . .",
    "in order to study how the spin - spiral structure affect the electronic band structure@xcite and also to help getting further insight into the spin - spiral instability at the microscopic level,@xcite the electronic band structures of the v and mn chains at several spin - spiral wave vectors @xmath12 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ vband ] and fig .",
    "[ mnband ] , respectively . the ferromagnetic ( @xmath14 ) band structures",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ vband ] and fig .",
    "[ mnband]a .",
    "because of the linear chain symmetry , the bands may be grouped into three sets , namely , the nondegenerate @xmath29- and @xmath30-dominant bands , doubly degenerate ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) bands , and ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) dominant bands , see figs .",
    "[ vband]a and [ mnband]a .",
    "the ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) bands are narrow because the @xmath33 , and @xmath34 orbitals are perpendicular to the chain , thus forming weak @xmath35 bonds .",
    "the @xmath31 , and @xmath32bands , on the other hand , are more dispersive due to the stronger overlap of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 orbitals along the chain , which gives rise to the @xmath4 bonds .",
    "the @xmath29- and @xmath30-dominant bands are most dispersive since these orbitals form strong @xmath36 bonds along the chain",
    ".    two main changes could appear in a ferromagnetic band structure when a spin - spiral wave is introduced , namely , the lifting of the accidental degeneracy at the cross - point of spin - up and spin - down bands and the `` repulsion '' of opposite - spin bands.@xcite these changes can be clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ vband]b and [ mnband]b .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ vband]b , the spin - up and spin - down @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands clearly move away from each other .",
    "of course , these changes due to the noncollinear spin - spiral wave become more pronounced as @xmath12 increases ( figs . [ vband ] and [ mnband ] ) . in the v chain ,",
    "the repulsion of opposite - spin bands appear to lower the spin - up @xmath31-@xmath32 band considerably while in the mean time raise the spin - down @xmath31 and @xmath32 band significantly ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ vband]b and c ) .",
    "this could be the reason why the spin - spiral structure is energetically favored over the ferromagnetic state . in the mn chain , on the other hand ,",
    "as the wave vector @xmath12 becomes nonzero , the fully occupied spin - up @xmath31-@xmath32 band near the @xmath7 point is pushed down substantially ( see fig . [ mnband ] ) .",
    "this change could lead to a lowering of the total energy , thereby stabilizing the spin - spiral structure in the mn chain .",
    "[ vband ] and [ mnband ] also show , in contrast , that as the spiral wave vector @xmath12 becomes nonzero , the dispersive @xmath29- and @xmath30-dominant valence bands near the @xmath7 point are pushed up in energy , and these shifts are more or less proportional to the modulus of spin spiral vector @xmath3 .",
    "this upward movement of the @xmath29- and @xmath30-dominant bands might raise the total band energy .",
    "therefore , the final equilibrium spiral wave vector @xmath12 would be determined by a trade - off of these two contrasting changes in the electronic band structure of the atomic chain .",
    "along @xmath7 to @xmath37 direction .",
    "figure ( a ) , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , that indicates a spin - polarized ferromagnetic band structure whilst figure ( f ) , @xmath40 ( @xmath39 ) , indicates an af band structure.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +     along @xmath7 to @xmath37 direction .",

    "we have calculated the total energy of the transverse spin - spiral wave as a function of the wave vector for all 3@xmath0 transition metal atomic chains within _ ab initio _ density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation . as a result , we predict that at the equilibrium bond length , the v , mn , and fe chains have a stable spin spiral structure . furthermore , all the exchange interaction parameters of the 3@xmath0 transition metal chains are evaluated by using the calculated energy dispersion relations of the spin - spiral waves .",
    "interestingly , we find that the magnetic couplings in the v , mn and cr chains are frustrated ( i.e. , the second near neighbor exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic ) , and this leads to the formation of the stable spin - spiral structure in these chains . the spin - wave stiffness constant of these 3@xmath0 is also evaluated and compared with its counterpart in bulk and monolayer systems . we have also estimated the upper limit of the possible magnetic phase transition temperature in these atomic chains within the mean field approximation .",
    "the electronic band structure of the spin - spiral structures have also been calculated .",
    "we hope that our findings of the stable spin - spiral structure and frustrated magnetic interaction in the 3@xmath0 transition metal chains would stimulate further theoretical and experimental research in this field . indeed , after learning our _ ab initio _ results",
