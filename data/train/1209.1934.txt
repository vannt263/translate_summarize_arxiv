    "the apparent connection between superconductivity and magnetism in cuprates , pnictides and other unconventional superconductors is not , at present , well understood theoretically .",
    "a possible mechanism behind this connection is through the formation of slowly fluctuating inhomogeneous magnetic structures emerging as a result of strong tendency towards electronic phase separation@xcite .",
    "electronic phase separation fluctuating in space and time is difficult to investigate experimentally . in this respect ,",
    "the lanthanum family of high temperature cuprate superconductors at the doping level 1/8 has long been the subject of intense interest , due to the fact that electronic spin and charge modulations in these materials are static in time and periodic in space .",
    "the character of these modulations , however , is still the subject to mutually exclusive propositions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to examine these propositions from the viewpoint of nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) experiments@xcite and muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) experiments@xcite .    at present",
    ", the dominant viewpoint is that the spin and charge modulations in 1/8-doped lanthanum cuprates have the character of one - dimensional stripes@xcite .",
    "motivated by the stm observations of checkerboards@xcite , one of us previously investigated the two - dimensional alternatives to the stripe interpretations  initially in the form of grid@xcite and then , after neutron scattering evidence against grid appeared@xcite , in the form of spin vortex checkerboard@xcite .",
    "refs.@xcite also contain detailed discussion of the arguments in favor and against the stripe proposition .",
    "the readers are referred to refs.@xcite for various considerations pertaining to the formation of spin vortices and other non - collinear spin superstructures .",
    "static spin modulations create the distribution of local magnetic fields , whose effect is observable by both nqr and @xmath0sr experiments .",
    "the advantage of these experiments is that one can make experimental predictions for a given spin modulation pattern essentially without further theoretical assumptions .",
    "the disadvantage is that these techniques do not resolve the wave vectors of spin modulations .    the comparative analysis of the stripe and grid superstructures from the viewpoint of nqr experimentswas done in refs.@xcite and from the viewpoint of @xmath0sr in ref.@xcite . the results of the nqr analysis indicated that the stripe pattern would lead to significant discrepancies with experiment due to a certain singularity in the distribution of local magnetic fields .",
    "at the same time , the grid pattern did not lead to that singularity and , as a result , was better compatible with nqr experiments .",
    "in general , however , the nqr experiments were even better compaible with a totally random gaussian distribution of the local fields , which , in turn , would be incompatible with the static modulated spin response observed by elastic neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0sr results@xcite , on the other hand , were more consistent with the stripe pattern than with the grid precisely because of the presence of the above mentioned singularity on the distribution of local magnetic fields .",
    "at the same time , it was not possible to reproduce the @xmath0sr results quantitatively from the full three - dimensional stacking of either stripes or grid .    the above rather incoherent phenomenology is further complicated by the discrepancy in the estimate of the spin modulation amplitude from @xmath0sr ( about @xmath1 ) and from neutron scattering ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the nqr experiments are more consistent with the latter estimate .",
    "so far , the attempts to analyze nqr/@xmath0sr data have not included the spin vortex lattice .",

    "below , we use variable @xmath16 to denote the maximum spin polarization of a given pattern .",
    "we also use bohr magneton units for electronic spin polarizations , so that the maximum polarization of spin 1/2 corresponds to @xmath17 .    possible specific patterns of general form([s])include : ( i ) stripes , e.g. @xmath18 [ fig .",

    "below , however , we also present nqr/@xmath0sr calculations for the two - spiral pattern ( v ) , which were done , in part , to make the analysis complete and , in another part , because as obvious from fig .  [ spinmodulation](c ) ] this pattern appears to be consistent with the minimum of the pseudogap along the diagonal lattice direction@xcite .",
    "when necessary for the @xmath0sr calculations , the three - dimensional arrangement of the above spin modulations was chosen as follows . for stripes ,",

    "spin vortices checkerboards and the two - spiral superstructures are both shifted in the adjacent layers by approximately two lattice periods in both the @xmath25 and @xmath26-directions , so that the spin - poor regions in one layer are located on the top of the spin - rich regions in the adjacent layer . in the case of stripes ,",
    "the above arrangement is what is proposed by tranquada , even though theoretical doubts about such proposition exist@xcite .",
    "for the two other superstractures , the above arrangement is based solely on the basis of coulomb repulsion between the same - charge regions , and the assumption that spin - poor regions accumulate charge carriers and thus positively charged , while spin - rich regions are negatively charged .    in the following",

    "the spin noise is to be uncorrelated between different lattice sites .",
    "for each site , it will have two in - plane components , each randomly selected from the gaussian distribution with zero average and root - mean - squared deviation denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "the noise was incorporated in the nqr calculations by analytically modifying the formulas presented in the next section , while the @xmath0sr calculations were based on the actual sampling of the three dimensional spin structure with or without the noise .      at low temperatures , static spin modulations",

    "the calculation of the nqr lineshape ( echo intensity as a function of the frequency of nqr echo pulses ) requires computing six transition frequencies between the four eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , weighing these transitions by the square of the appropriate matrix element and by the square of the frequency itself and then averaging over all possible values of the hyperfine field associated with a given spin superstructure . the framework and the nqr parameters of our calculations including the a- and b- nqr lines and broadening of these lines are identical to those used in refs.@xcite , where stripe and grid superstructures were considered .",

    "finally , we have attempted to explore the possibility that the muon site is different from the one identified by hitti et al.@xcite .",
    "trying the muon positions in the @xmath66-plane 1  away from the apical oxygen , we were able to improve the @xmath0sr fit for the stripes and 2d spirals with muon position at @xmath67 and with @xmath68 , @xmath61 . in this case , the nqr spectrum has a single main peak , which is much narrower than the one observed experimentally , but with the maximum at the experimentally observed frequency .",

    "the outcome of the analysis presented in this paper indicates that spin vortex lattice leads to the singularity in the distribution of local magnetic fields , which is quite similar to the one produced by the stripe pattern . as a result",
