    "the problem of the electron dephasing processes in disordered conductors has long been of fundamental importance and great interest . in general ,",
    "the responsible electron dephasing mechanisms are determined by the system dimensionality , the level of disorder , and the measurement temperature @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite in three - dimensional ( 3d ) weakly disordered metals , electron - phonon ( _ e_-ph ) scattering is often the dominant dephasing mechanism .",
    "@xcite while in lower dimensions , electron - electron ( _ e_-_e _ ) scattering is the major dephasing process , which gives rise to a phase relaxation rate of @xmath8 in two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite and @xmath9 in one dimension .",
    "@xcite in 1974 , schmid had already theoretically investigated the possible influence of disorder on the _ e_-_e _ scattering in 3d conductors .",
    "@xcite he found that the diffusive electron dynamics should enhance the scattering strength , and thus the total _",
    "e_-_e _ scattering rate could be written as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is boltzmann constant , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the fermi energy ( wavenumber ) , @xmath14 is the planck constant divided by @xmath15 , and @xmath5 is the electron elastic mean free path .",
    "a similar expression has also been derived by altshuler and aronov .",
    "@xcite the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq.(ee3d ) ] ) is the _",
    "e_-_e _ scattering rate in a perfect , periodic potential , while the second term is the enhanced contribution due to the introduction of imperfections ( defects , impurities , etc . ) .",
    "microscopically , the second term stands for the small - energy - transfer _ e_-_e _ scattering process and is responsible at @xmath16 , while the first term represents the large - energy - transfer process and would dominate at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electron elastic mean - free time . @xcite as mentioned , the scattering rate predicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq.(ee3d ) ] ) is much weaker than the _",
    "e_-ph scattering rate in typical 3d disordered metals .",
    "thus , the prediction of eq .",

    "tin - doped indium oxide ( ito ) is the most widely used transparent conducting oxide in current optoelectronic devices . in terms of the advantages for fundamental studies ,",

    "@xcite the electron concentrations , @xmath22 , are @xmath7 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in typical metals , and essentially independent of temperature .",
    "@xcite recently , wu and coworkers have studied the electron dephasing processes in 2d ito thin films.@xcite they found that the @xmath6-@xmath6 scattering dominated the dephasing in a wide @xmath0 range from liquid - helium temperatures up to nearly 100 k. in 3d disordered conductors , we notice that the @xmath6-ph relaxation rate , @xmath23 , scales essentially linearly with @xmath22 ( refs . , and ) , while the second term in eq .",
