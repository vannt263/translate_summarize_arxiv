    "large momentum scales these perturbative interactions provide an accurate description of qcd interactions , and pqcd predictions can be compared to the experimentally observed cross sections for quark and gluon jet production . at small momentum transfers",
    "however pqcd becomes inaccurate , and the dynamics of qcd is instead dominated by the nonperturbative phenomenon known as _",
    "the gluon self - interactions lead to the formation of a  flux tube \" between color sources , which gives rise to an approximately linear potential . due to this effect only states with zero total color ,  color - singlets \" , can exist as physical bound states .",
    "this flux tube and the associated asymptotically linear potential are clearly evident in lattice gauge theory simulations with static sources ( see figs.1,2 @xcite ) .",
    "hadrons are conventionally classified according to which  valence \" basis state in hilbert space is thought to dominate the hadronic state vector . this simple classification in terms of pure valence states provides a useful and surprisingly accurate description of most known resonances .",
    "of course we should emphasize that this is an approximation of unknown accuracy with no clear justification , and may well be misleading in the description of unconventional types of hadrons .      the physically allowed color - singlet states one can form from quarks and antiquarks alone are generically of the form @xmath4 .",
    "the simplest such combinations are @xmath5 and @xmath6 product basis states is formed by taking all possible quark types  flavors \" for @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and by allowing the states to take on all possible quark spin arrangements and orbital angular momenta , and finally by allowing excitation of the radial wavefunctions .",
    "we will discuss the detailed quantum numbers allowed to @xmath8 mesons in particular in the next section .",
    "these three simplest color - singlet states , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are special in that they are _ irreducible _ , in other words they they can not be partitioned into separate color - singlet substates .",
    "the  higher \" fock space color singlets in contrast are _ reducible _ , and need not be realized in nature as isolated resonances",

    "can  decay \" without interaction .",
    "it is expected therefore that they either have extremely broad widths from  _ fall - apart _ \" into these final states , or may not be realized in nature as resonances at all .",
    "this fall - apart problem would be circumvented by a multiquark state with a mass below all strong decay thresholds , which would therefore be strongly stable .",
    "possibilities for strongly stable multiquark states include the @xmath13  h dibaryon \" @xcite and  heavy - light \" @xmath14 clusters , with @xmath15 or @xmath16 @xcite .    alternatively",
    ", one may find quasinuclear bound states of largely undistorted hadrons that formally lie in multiquark sectors of hilbert space , such as nuclei , hypernuclei , and perhaps @xmath17 bound states @xcite .",
    "most known mesons are reasonably well described as @xmath8 ( quark - antiquark ) bound states .",
    "since quarks have @xmath18 , the @xmath8 pair can have total spin @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath8 orbital angular momentum @xmath20 can take on any integer value ; combining these @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath8 angular momenta gives the allowed total angular momentum @xmath23 .",
    "the allowed values are @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) .",
    "meson quark model assignments may be specified using spectroscopic notation , @xmath28 . as examples ,",
    "the @xmath29 is a @xmath30 state , the @xmath31 is @xmath32 and the @xmath33 @xmath34 is a @xmath35 @xmath8 quark model state .",
    "radial excitation may be indicated using a prefactor , thus the first radially - excited @xmath36 @xmath37 , known as the @xmath38 , is a @xmath39 state .",
    "spatial parity @xmath40 and charge - conjugation parity @xmath41 are exact symmetries of the qcd lagrangian , and as such are conserved in strong decays . in @xmath8 states",
    "these quantum numbers are @xmath42 and @xmath43 a state s @xmath44 quantum numbers follow directly from these relations ; for example the @xmath30 @xmath45 has @xmath46 , the @xmath32 @xmath31 has @xmath47 , and the @xmath35 @xmath34 has @xmath48 .",
    "as we shall see , sensitive tests of the nature of interquark forces are possible given accurate experimental information on the spectrum of @xmath8 states in heavy quark systems ; @xmath37 is an especially clear case .",

    ", i will be very brief here and proceed to the @xmath37 and @xmath37-hybrid states .",
    "one may also form physically allowed ( color - singlet ) basis states from pure gluons and from quark , antiquark and gluon product states .",
    "hadrons which have such configurations as valence basis states are known collectively as  gluonic hadrons \" .",
    "color - singlet gluon states ( if we neglect quarks ) form idealized , unmixed  glueball \" resonances . the spectrum of these states has been studied extensively in lgt ( see for example @xcite ) , and an impressively detailed theoretical spectrum has been determined .",
    "unfortunately for experimentalists , lgt predicts only one glueball below 2  gev , a scalar at 1.6  gev , and no @xmath44-exotics are expected below ca",
    ". 4  gev .",
    "this scalar has been identified with the @xmath51 seen in @xmath52 annihilation @xcite , although there are outstanding problems with clear violation of flavor symmetry in the strong decay branching fractions of this state ; naively one would expect a glueball to couple symmetrically to all quark flavors .",
    "this flavor - symmetry violation may indicate that glueball - quarkonium mixing is an important effect @xcite .",
    "this mixing could be important both in decays and in mass shifts of the observed resonances relative to lgt predictions ; since this is in effect a systematic error for lgt , it will be very important to quantify .",
    "the relatively narrow width of the @xmath51 glueball candidate is very encouraging for higher - mass glueball searches ; lgt predicts these to be a @xmath53 and a @xmath54 , just below 2.5  gev .",
    "of course identification of these states will require clarification of the higher quarkonia expected in the same mass region .",
    "a future @xmath52 machine could make a very useful contribution through an accurate determination of the branching fractions of the @xmath51 and other light glueball and hybrid candidates .",
    "hybrids are the most experimentally attractive of the anticipated non-@xmath8 resonances , because their valence @xmath55 basis states span complete flavor nonets ( hence hybrids have a much richer spectrum of states than glueballs ) and the lowest - lying hybrid multiplet is expected to contain exotic quantum numbers . _ all _ @xmath44 combinations can be formed from @xmath55 states , so any @xmath44-exotic might _ a priori _ be a hybrid meson candidate .",
    "lgt has recently contributed several estimates of light exotic hybrid meson masses @xcite , and at present it appears that the combination @xmath56 is the lightest exotic , with a mass of @xmath57  gev in the @xmath58 @xmath8 flavor sector .",
    "this is consistent with estimates using the flux - tube model @xcite , and rather heavier than bag model results , which favored @xmath59  gev .",
    "we can expect to identify the @xmath44-exotic hybrids rather easily , provided that we study their favored decay modes .",
    "the expectation of both flux tube @xcite and constituent gluon @xcite models is that light hybrids should decay preferentially to pairs of @xmath8 mesons in which one has a unit of orbital excitation , the so - called",
    " s+p \" modes . for the lightest @xmath60",
    ", @xmath56 hybrid these modes are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are rather difficult to reconstruct and so had not been investigated carefully before the recent interest in hybrid mesons .    as a caution",
    "we note that the only two light exotic hybrid candidates , the @xmath63 and @xmath64 , both have these @xmath60 , @xmath56 quantum numbers , but lie ca .",
    "500  mev below the lgt and flux - tube mass predictions and apparently decay strongly to the s+s modes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which are forbidden to hybrids in the flux - tube decay model .",
    "evidently these theoretical expectations for hybrids should not be regarded as more than tentative guidelines at present .",
    "we can of course expect a systematic improvement in lgt predictions as algorithms and computer performance improve .",
    "there are 11 known @xmath37 resonances ; the spectrum is shown in fig.3 .",
    "( a possible 12_th _ @xmath37 state , a candidate for the anticipated narrow @xmath67d@xmath68 , was reported in @xmath69 at 3.836  gev by the e705 collaboration @xcite .",
    "this effect has a rather low @xmath70 statistical significance , and needs confirmation . )",
    "there is a predominance of @xmath71 vector states simply because most of these resonances were found at @xmath72 machines , which form only @xmath71 states in s - channel .",
    "the remaining states in the 1p multiplet and the @xmath73s@xmath74 spin - singlet @xmath75 were found in radiative transitions from the 1s and 2s vectors , with the single exception of the @xmath76 ; this @xmath56 state has been observed only in @xmath52 annihilation .",
    "since charmonium is only quasirelativistic , one can expect that the level of configuration mixing is much reduced relative to light mesons ( the gluon emission amplitude is @xmath77 ) , so that one may be able to clearly identify the separate effects of confinement and gluon exchange ( @xmath78 mixing ) in the @xmath37 spectrum .",
    "since spin - dependent forces do not appear in the effective interquark interaction until @xmath79 in the quark momenta , we might expect that a naive zeroth - order static potential that incorporated the oge color - coulomb potential and linear confinement might give a reasonable approximation to the observed @xmath37 spectrum @xcite .",
    "we can test this by assuming the potential @xmath80 and solving the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation for bound states in this potential .",
    "inspection of the experimental @xmath37 spectrum ( fig.3 ) suggests 1s , 1p and 2s multiplets with spin - averaged masses of ca .",
    "3.07  gev , 3.52  gev and 3.67  gev , respectively .",
    "if we use these as input to fix the three potential model parameters @xmath81 and the charm quark mass @xmath82 , we find @xmath83 , @xmath84  gev@xmath85 and @xmath86  gev .",
    "most of the remaining @xmath37 levels predicted to lie below 4.6  gev ( 1s .. 4s,1p .. 3p,1d .. 3d,1f,2f,1g,2 g and 1h ) are shown in fig.4 , together with the experimental spectrum . with a multiplicity of 2 for s - states ( @xmath73s@xmath74,@xmath67s@xmath87 ) and 4 for higher-@xmath21 states , this model predicts 52 independent @xmath37 states below 4.6  gev .",
    "the proximity of the experimental masses to the predicted radial and orbital levels in fig.4 confirms that the simple description of @xmath37 states as nonrelativistic fermions in a coulomb - plus - linear potential is a reasonable first approximation .",
    "the level splittings within an orbitally - excited multiplet such as 1p provide more sensitive tests of the nature of interquark forces . assuming that the short - ranged force is due to one - gluon exchange ( oge )",
    ", we expect the spin - dependent forces to be reasonably well described by the breit - fermi hamiltonian , which follows from an @xmath79 expansion of the oge t - matrix .",
    "this breit - fermi interaction , which is familiar from atomic physics , has spin - spin , spin - orbit and tensor terms , and for equal - mass quarks and antiquarks ( @xmath88 ) is explicitly @xmath89 @xmath90 there are also spin - dependent terms which change the relative positions of multiplets by @xmath79 but do not separate levels within a multiplet .",
    "several very characteristic features of this oge interaction are immediately evident .",
    "first , since the spin - spin interaction is a contact term , it has no effect on orbitally - excited states .",
    "thus the spin - singlet state @xmath91 is predicted to be degenerate with the multiplicity - weighted  center - of - gravity \" of the spin - triplet states @xmath92 .",
    "( the spin - orbit and tensor mass shifts give zero when weighted by multiplicity . )",
    "thus in the 1p multiplet we predict that the @xmath93p@xmath87 @xmath94 spin singlet should have a mass of @xmath95 this relation is very well satisfied by the experimental candidate @xmath76 reported by the fermilab collaboration e760/835 in @xmath52 annihilation @xcite ; it has a mass of @xmath96 the agreement is not expected to be exact because this is an @xmath79 derivation , and makes additional approximations such as assuming pure @xmath37 states and _ only _ oge at small @xmath97 .    this result",
    "is often cited as a sensitive test of the lorentz nature of the confining interaction . _ a priori _ one might have assumed that the confining interaction couples to the color charge density @xmath98 , so that the complete quark - antiquark interaction is of the same form as the qed coulomb interaction , @xmath99 .",
    "this was assumed in the original cornell model , and is still advocated by swanson and szczepaniak @xcite .",
    "alternatively the confining interaction might couple to the lorentz scalar density @xmath100 , so that the complete interaction transforms as @xmath101 .",
    "these two possibilities may be distinguished by the @xmath79 spin - dependent hamiltonian . the general result for the spin - spin @xmath37 interaction due to",
    "a @xmath99 potential @xmath102 is @xmath103 with a _ vector _ linear confining interaction @xmath104 this becomes @xmath105 this vector confinement would displace the @xmath73p@xmath87 @xmath94 state upwards in mass from the @xmath67p@xmath106 c.o.g . by @xmath107  mev ; since these energies are actually equal to within about 1  mev , this is a very strong argument in favor of scalar over vector confinement .",
    "since the @xmath76 state is not very well established experimentally , and has been seen only in @xmath52 annihilation , confirmation of this @xmath73p@xmath87 state and a precise mass determination will be a very important exercise for gsi .",
    "in addition to this oge interaction there is an inverted spin - orbit interaction due to the linear scalar confining potential , which is given by @xmath108    the effect of incorporating these additional spin - dependent terms as first order perturbations is shown in fig.5 .",
    "note that this is _ not _ a fit to the observed multiplet splittings , rather these splittings follow from the @xmath81 and @xmath82 that fit the 1s , 1p and 2s multiplet centers of gravity ( fig.4 ) . as a qualitative description of the relative positions and scale of splittings within the multiplet this model is evidently quite successful .",
    "the relative splitting @xmath109 is an especially interesting quantity , since the wavefunction uncertainties approximately cancel and one can see the effects of the negative ( scalar confinement ) spin - orbit and ( small ) oge tensor terms . the observed ratio is rather close to theoretical expectations from oge and linear scalar confinement .",
    "similar tests in the 2p and especially 1d multiplets would be quite interesting at gsi , since the negative scalar spin - orbit term is longer ranged than the oge spin - orbit , so we expect to see considerable narrowing of the multiplet splittings with increasing orbital and radial excitations .",
    "complete inversion is predicted with increasing @xmath21 , but other effects such as configuration mixing and coupling to open charm states may mask this interesting effect .",
    "accurate mass determinations of many conventional @xmath37 states above open charm threshold will be very useful for theorists trying to quantify the various mass shifts .",
    "identification of the @xmath37 spectrum above the open - charm threshold at 3.73  gev will be interesting for tests of decay models , spectroscopy models , and also because these states are a  background \" which might otherwise be confused with charmonium hybrids , charm meson molecules , or other unusual states .",
    "first , the two 1d states @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) are especially interesting because they can not decay to @xmath114 , and hence should be relatively narrow .",
    "( @xmath114 is of course an abbreviation for @xmath115 in this context . )",
    "studies of the relative branching fractions of other higher - mass @xmath37 states to the presumably dominant open - charm modes ( @xmath116 ) will be an extremely interesting contribution to our understanding of strong qcd physics .",
    "theorists usually treat open - flavor strong decays using the  @xmath67p@xmath74 decay model \" or one of its variants such as the flux - tube model .",
    "this type of decay model , which predates qcd , describes open - flavor decays as due to @xmath8 pair creation with vacuum ( @xmath67p@xmath74 ) quantum numbers .",
    "just why this model works is unclear , and the evidence supporting it is rather meagre ; the classic tests are the @xmath117 amplitude ratios in the two decays @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "since so much of hadron spectroscopy makes use of this decay model ( the weak @xmath120 solution of the  missing baryon \" problem and the s+p hybrid signature are two examples ) , it is very important to test it using a wide range of resonance quantum numbers and final states .",
    "the higher - mass @xmath37 states will be very useful in this regard .",
    "calculations of the open - charm branching fractions of higher @xmath37 states have previously been reported using the @xmath67p@xmath74 model @xcite , and these show interesting dependence on the nodal structure of the radial @xmath37 wavefunctions .",
    "an experimental determination of the strong decay amplitudes of the accessible higher - mass @xmath37 states would allow an extremely interesting test of this widely used but inadequately tested strong decay model .",
    "the little that is known about strong decays of the higher - mass @xmath37 states already includes a famous puzzle ; the @xmath121 , which has a mass consistent with a 3s state ( fig.4 ) , purportedly has relative branching fractions of @xmath122 , despite the fact that the @xmath123 mode has essentially no phase space ! this led to speculations that the @xmath121 might be a @xmath123 molecule @xcite , or that it may be the expected 3 @xmath67s@xmath87 @xmath37 state , but with nearby decay amplitude zeros that lead to these anomalous branching fractions @xcite .",
    "since we hope to use branching fractions to characterize states , an accurate test of these and other strong branching fractions would clearly be a first priority at a new @xmath52 charmonium facility .",
    "the charmonium system is an excellent laboratory for the study of nonperturbative qcd effects such as confinement and gluonic excitations .",
    "it has the advantage of being quasirelativistic ; the adiabatic @xmath37 potential is clearly evident in the spectrum of states , but the @xmath124 @xmath125 gluonic configuation mixing is sufficiently large to be accurately determined and compared with model predictions , for example in the @xmath79 spin - dependent multiplet splittings of the 1p states .",
    "the simplicity of the known @xmath37 spectrum suggests that it may be straightforward to identify relatively unmixed charmonium hybrids as  extra \" charmonium states through a more complete determination of the experimental spectrum .",
    "of course the identification of complete hybrid multiplets , especially @xmath44 exotics , would be a crucial contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of gluonic excitations . in the charmonium system",
    "these states may be narrow enough to make this a feasible experimental program .",
    "recent theoretical advances have simplified the problem of searching for hybrid charmonium considerably .",
    "previous model estimates of the mass of the lowest hybrid charmonium multiplet varied over a rather wide range , ca .",
    "4.0 - 4.5  gev .",
    "( for a review of this earlier work see ref.@xcite . ) with the development of lattice nrqcd we now have lattice results for the masses of exotic @xmath37- and @xmath126-hybrids that report very small statistical errors of ca .",
    "( the systematic uncertainties are not yet known but might be ca .",
    "50  mev , and will be estimated in subsequent work . ) as one example , the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite quote masses for the @xmath127 ( expected to be the lightest exotic ) @xmath37 and @xmath126 hybrid states of @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( i assume multiplicity - weighted 1s masses of 3.07  gev for @xmath37 and 9.45  gev for @xmath126 . )",
    "thus we have a presumably accurate lattice estimate of the mass of the lightest @xmath37 hybrid multiplet , @xmath130  gev .",
    "the precise mass of the lightest hybrid multiplet has previously been of great interest because of the flux - tube model prediction that s+p modes should be strongly favored for hybrids ; if @xmath37-hybrids were below the s+p threshold of @xmath131  gev , one might have anticipated relatively narrow states . with the nrqcd lattice results it now appears that s+p modes are indeed open , so @xmath37-hybrids need not be anomalously narrow . in any case",
    "the observation of important @xmath132 and @xmath133 modes for the hybrid candidates @xmath63 and @xmath64 suggests that experiment may not support this selection rule as an especially rigorous one ; the simple s+s modes @xmath114 , @xmath134 and @xmath123 may well be the dominant hybrid modes . it will be very important experimentally to search all allowed quasi - two - body open charm modes for these states .",
    "just as with the conventional @xmath37 states , much is speculated but very little is known about open - flavor strong branching fractions of hybrids .",
