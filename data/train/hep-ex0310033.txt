    "precision tests have shown a remarkable agreement between experimental data and predictions from the standard model , especially in the electroweak sector @xcite .",
    "however , the standard model does not explain the huge value of the planck scale ( @xmath2 ) with respect to the electroweak scale ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that this hierarchy problem can be solved if gravity propagates in more dimensions than the standard model particles .",
    "arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) proposed a model @xcite in which gravity propagates freely in @xmath5 extra , compact spatial dimensions . in their model , the electroweak scale is the only fundamental scale , and the apparent large planck scale follows directly from the existence of extra dimensions . from a generalization of the gravitational potential in @xmath6 dimensions , they find for the radius @xmath7 of these extra dimensions : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fundamental scale in @xmath6 dimensions , and @xmath2 is the apparent 4-dimensional planck scale . taking @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "it is remarkable that from direct gravitational measurements , only @xmath15 has been excluded at present @xcite .",
    "note that in the add approach , the size of the extra dimensions is `` large '' with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "randall and sundrum ( rs ) propose a 5-dimensional model @xcite in which the 4-dimensional metric is multiplied by an exponential `` warp '' factor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the 5-dimensional planck scale .",
    "the fifth dimension appears as a finite interval @xmath19 whose size is given by @xmath20 .",
    "even if @xmath20 is small , a large hierarchy can be generated by this exponential factor .",
    "in other words , the size of the extra dimension in the rs model is relatively small compared to the size of the extra dimensions in the add approach .    in both models ,",
    "effects of the extra dimensions could become visible in collider experiments at the@xmath21 scale .      in hadron - hadron collisions ,",
    "real gravitons can be produced in association with a jet or a photon @xcite .",
    "the graviton propagates in the extra dimensions and is therefore invisible in a detector .",
    "it will manifest itself as missing transverse energy ( ) .",
    "virtual graviton exchange will modify the cross section for di - lepton and di - photon production .",
    "the exact experimental observation is different for the two models . in the rs model",
    ", the size of the extra dimension is small and thus the separation between the kaluza - klein modes ( quantized energy levels in the finite extra dimension ) of the graviton is large .",
    "therefore , the graviton will be produced resonantly .",
    "however , in the add model the separation between the graviton kaluza - klein modes is small ( as small as @xmath22 for @xmath23 @xcite ) due to the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "this will lead to an overall modification of the cross section at high di - lepton or di - photon invariant mass .",
    "the cross section for di - lepton or di - photon production in the presence of extra dimensions can be written as @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the invariant mass of the two particles and @xmath27 is the scattering angle in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the term @xmath28 describes the standard model cross section , @xmath29 the interference of the graviton - induced amplitude with that of the standard model processes , and @xmath30 describes the pure graviton exchange term .",
    "different formalisms exist for the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32    in the remainder of this paper , experimental searches for graviton emission and exchange at the tevatron @xmath0 collider will be presented . during run",
    "i , the @xmath0 centre - of - mass energy was @xmath33 whereas during the ongoing run  ii , it has been increased to @xmath34 , with higher instantaneous and integrated luminosities .",
    "in addition , a brief overview of prospects at the lhc @xmath1 collider ( @xmath35 ) is given .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has searched for graviton emission in the jets  +   channel , based on an integrated luminosity of @xmath36 collected during run  i. the main background in this channel is @xmath37  +  jets production , where the @xmath37 boson decays invisibly in a neutrino - antineutrino pair . as can be seen from the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfjets ] , the data agree well with expectation in the absence of extra dimensions .",
    "this leads to lower limits on @xmath9 of 1@xmath21 , 770@xmath38 , 710@xmath38 for @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "these results are very similar to the previously established d limits in this channel @xcite .",
    "a similar search by the cdf collaboration in the @xmath40  +   channel gives no excess above the expectation from the standard model and thus lower limits on @xmath9 of 549@xmath38 , 581@xmath38 , 602@xmath38 for @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity in the jets  +   sample is higher due to the larger cross section .    at the lhc , with @xmath42 of integrated luminosity , discovery of extra dimensions in the jets@xmath43 channel is possible up to high mass scales .",
    "as shown by the atlas collaboration @xcite , significant signals can be found up to values of @xmath9 of 9.1@xmath21 , 7.0@xmath21 , 6.0@xmath21 for @xmath44 .",
    "both the cdf and d collaborations have searched for virtual graviton exchange in the add model .",
    "cdf analyzed the invariant mass spectrum of photon pairs from an integrated luminosity of approximately @xmath45 , collected during run  i. the selected sample agrees well with the expectation from standard model induced di - photon production and from misidentified di - photon events .",
    "a similar agreement was found in a di - electron sample , leading to lower limits on @xmath9 in the hewett convention ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hewett ] ) ) given in table  [ tab : cdfdiem - add ] .",

    "background to graviton exchange in this decay mode is mainly caused by standard model di - muon production , estimated from a monte carlo simulation , and by heavy quark decay , estimated from the data itself .",
    "similarly , di - photon and di - electron events were studied in 120@xmath49 of integrated luminosity in run  ii .",
    "background from standard model di - photon and di - electron production was estimated from monte carlo simulations , and background from misidentified qcd events was derived from the data sample . in both channels , a good agreement between data and background estimates was observed in distributions of both the invariant mass and the scattering angle .    a 10 - 15% higher sensitivity to graviton exchange",
    "is expected from fitting the data in the @xmath26 versus @xmath50 plane @xcite instead of in @xmath26 only .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "such a two - dimensional fit ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d - crosssection ] ) ) yields @xmath51 and in the combined di - photon , di - electron sample @xmath52 .",

    "lower limits on the higher dimensional planck scale were set , reaching over 1@xmath21 in current tevatron run  ii data .",
    "the combined di - photon and di - electron sample of d provides the most stringent limits on the add model . in the near future , more data from run  ii at the tevatron will become available , increasing the sensitivity to extra dimensions .",
