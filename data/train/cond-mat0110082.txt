    "the advances in fabrication technologies have made it possible to experimentally fabricate one dimensional electronic structures@xcite@xcite .",
    "this has naturally resulted in an increasing interest in theoretical investigations of such structures@xcite@xcite .",
    "the resulting one dimensional electron gas has also been subject to computational investigation@xcite .",
    "the extensive investigations in the three dimensional electron gas have clearly shown the importance of the short range correlations at lower densities in determining the pair distribution function @xmath0 at small @xmath1@xcite .    in the high density limit , the long range correlations can be described well by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "one way to include the short range correlation effects beyond rpa is to use the powerful approach developed by stls@xcite .",
    "it is well known that stls approach suffers from a compressibility inconsistency .",
    "the compressibility calculated from the small @xmath2 limit of the dielectric function @xmath3 does not agree with that calculated from the ground state energy .",
    "there have been several attempts to overcome this inconsistency@xcite .",
    "sstl@xcite included the effect of screening on the effective interaction potential as explained in the next section .    in this work",
    ", we aim to check the performance of the sstl approach and compare it with the stls in a one dimensional electron gas . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first application of the sstl approach in lower dimensions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows ; the stls and sstl formalisms are given in section 2 .",
    "the results and discussion concentrating on the comparison between stls and sstl performance on the compressibility issue are presented in section 3 .",
    "in the mean field approximation , a key component of the electron gas is the usual static structure factor s(q ) which is related to density ",
    "density response function @xmath4 through the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem as    @xmath5    the density ",
    "density response function @xmath4 is defined as    ( q,)= , where @xmath6 is the zero  temperature susceptibility of a noninteracting electron gas and is given in one dimension by    _ 0(q,)=_01(q,)+i _ 02(q , ) , with    _ 01(q,)=| | , and @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the boundaries for particle  hole excitations .",
    "the fermi wave vector @xmath9 is related to the one dimensional electron density @xmath10 via @xmath11 .",
    "the dimensionless electron density parameter is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the effective bohr radius .",

    "( 2 ) is the self  consistent effective potential related to the static structure factor through    v_eff(q)=v(q)+_0^ \\{(q+k)v(q+k)+(q - k)v(q - k ) } , where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction between two electrons in the lowest subband in the harmonic confinement in one dimension and is given by    v(q)=  f(q ) , where @xmath16 is the background dielectric constant , @xmath2 is the wave vector along the wire and @xmath17 is the form factor which takes into account the finite thickness of the wire .",
    "the form factor reads    f(q)=  exp ( ) k_0 ( ) , here @xmath18 is the zeroth order modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath19 is the characteristic length of the harmonic potential .",
    "indeed , it is a measure of the effective radius of the quantum wire@xcite .    in the stls approximation ,    ( q,)= , where the local field correction @xmath20 is    g(q)=-_-^   [ s(q - k)-1 ] .",

    "consistently for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 within the stls approximation . in rpa , @xmath23 .",
    "the sstl approximation is different from the stls approximation in that the potential under the integral sign in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is screened by the static dielectric function @xmath3 which is given by ,    ( q)=1- . this is originally done to better satisfy the compressibility sum rule in three dimensional electron gas .",
    "the ground state energy per particle in one dimensional electron gas may be written as@xcite    _ g=_kin+_ex+_cor , where @xmath24 is the kinetic energy per particle , and simply @xmath25 in units of effective rydberg @xmath26 .",

    "the compressibility @xmath29 may be calculated either by using the ground state energy per particle @xmath30    = n^2  (",
    "n  _ g ) , or by using the @xmath31 limit of the static dielectric function @xmath3    _ q 0  ( q)=1+v(q )  n^2  k.    the compressibility sum rule is that the compressibilities calculated by using eq . ( 14 ) and eq . (",
    "15 ) are the same .",
    "in fig . 1 the local field correction @xmath20 calculated self  consistently using stls and sstl approximations are shown for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the most striking difference between the two curves is their large @xmath2 limits . as stls",
    "@xmath20 is approaching 1 , sstl @xmath20 approaches a limit bigger than 1 .",
    "it may be noted that the relation@xcite @xmath34 is satisfied in our calculations .",
    "this , of course , is going to lead to different results when applied to physical properties of the one dimensional electron gas .",
    "the different large @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath20 is expected to lead to different small @xmath1 behaviour of the pair correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2 . as radius of the wire gets smaller the difference between stls and sstl results become larger , as may be seen in fig .",
    "as the density becomes smaller ( i.e. , @xmath35 becomes larger ) the sstl @xmath0 becomes negative for small @xmath1 .",
    "this limit is where the correlation effects become important .",
    "the compressibility calculated by using the ground state energy in three different approaches is presented in fig .",
    "6 as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "the similarity in energies is also reflected in these curves .",
    "the negative compressibility values at higher @xmath35 show that the system becomes unstable .",
    "the compressibility calculated by using @xmath31 limit of the static dielectric function is shown in fig .",
    "the stls and sstl compressibilities calculated by two routes are as different as in rpa .",
    "this surprising result is a natural consequence of the small @xmath2 behaviour of the local field correction which is very small for sstl at small @xmath2 values .",
    "the compressibility in a one dimensional system is studied previously by gold and calmels@xcite using a three - sum - rule approach for the local field correction .",
    "the compressibility sum rule is better satisfied within this variant of stls in one dimension as can be seen from their figure 4 .",
    "we find the same result by the present full stls calculation .",
    "we can conclude that the short  range correlations are calculated using the sstl approximation in a one dimensional electron gas , for the first time .",
    "the performance of the sstl approximation is compared with the more widely used stls approximation .",
    "it is shown that sstl compares reasonably well with stls when the pair correlation function , dielectric function and the ground state energy per particle are considered but fails totally when the compressibility sum rule is checked ."
