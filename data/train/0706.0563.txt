    "over the last couple of decades , it has been clearly established that circumstellar disks are an integral part of the star formation process .",
    "even though there is currently no direct evidence that planets actually grow from circumstellar material , it has become increasingly clear that disks are potential birthplaces of planets because their masses , sizes , and compositions are consistent with those of the assumed pre - planetary solar nebulae ( hillenbrand 2003 ) .",
    "more recently , the discovery of exo - planets orbiting nearby main sequence stars has confirmed that the formation of planets is a common process and not a rare phenomenon exclusive to the solar system",
    ".    direct detection of forming planets is well beyond our current capabilities and observing molecular hydrogen , which largely dominates the mass of primordial disks , is particularly challenging ( thi et al .",
    "2001 , richter et al .",
    "however , the thermal emission from circumstellar dust is much easier to detect and study .",
    "for this reason , the study of the evolution of circumstellar dust has been a natural first step toward providing observational constraints on planet formation theories .",
    "strom et al . ( 1989 ) studied a sample of 83 classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) and weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) located in the taurus - auriga star - forming region in order to determine the fraction of objects with k - band ( 2.2 @xmath0 m ) and iras excesses indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "wtts are low - mass pre - main sequence stars that occupy the same region of the h ",
    "r diagram as ctts but do not show clear evidence of accretion .",
    "the distinction between the two is usually made based on the @xmath7 equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "the @xmath8 ew of ctts is @xmath9 10 @xmath10 , while the @xmath7 ew of wtts is @xmath4 10 @xmath10 . since there is a very strong correlation between spectroscopic signatures of gas accretion and the presence of near - ir excess ( hartigan et al .",
    "1995 ) , most ctts show near - ir excess while most wtts lack such an excess .",
    "strom et al . ( 1989 ) found that 60@xmath2 of their stars younger than 3 myrs showed a k - band excess , indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk , while only 10@xmath2 of the stars older than 10 myrs years did so .",
    "based on these numbers , they estimated a disk dissipation timescale of @xmath4 3 - 10 myrs and claimed that their result was , at the time , `` the best astrophysical constraint on the time available for planet building '' .",
    "it has been argued that individual star - forming regions such as taurus lack the intrinsic age spread necessary to investigate the dissipation timescale of circumstellar disks from individually derived ages ( hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "however , similar disk lifetimes studies based on the disk frequency of clusters with different mean ages and extending to the 3.4 @xmath0 m l - band ( e.g. haisch et al . 2001 ) have lead to results similar to those presented by strom and collaborators ( see hillenbrand ( 2006 ) for a review on the frequency of near - ir excesses based on a sample of @xmath13000 pms ) .",
    "the k - band excess , when used as a disk indicator , is only sensitive to dust in the innermost part of the disk ; therefore , k - band studies only constrain the dissipation timescale of a region of the disks that is much closer to the star than the locations corresponding to the orbits of any of the planets in the solar system ( mercury s semi - major axis is 0.39 au ) .",
    "the dissipation timescale of the dust in the planet - forming regions might or might not be the same .",
    "since the dynamical timescale is shorter and the surface density is higher closer to the central star , circumstellar disks are expected to evolve from the inside out .",
    "most wtts , which by definition present little or no evidence for accretion , also show little or no near - ir excess ( hartigan et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , even after the inner accretion disk has dissipated , it is entirely possible that wtts to still have enough material at larger radii to form terrestrial and giant planets .",
    "in fact , millimeter - wave observations show that at least 10 @xmath2 of wtts have disks with estimated masses in the @xmath11@xmath12 @xmath13 range ( osterloh @xmath14 beckwith 1995 , andrews and williams 2005 ) .",
    "while the existence of planets around a significant fraction of all ms stars has been verified ( e.g. , marcy @xmath14 butler 1998 ) , the fundamentals of the planet formation process still remain open questions , especially for giant planets .",
    "there are currently three main theories for the formation of giant planets : core accretion , gravitational instability , and hybrid models that combine aspects of both theories .",
    "see lissauer @xmath14 stevenson ( 2007 ) and durisen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for two recent reviews of the core accretion and gravitational instability models and a discussion of the many upstanding questions .",
    "although it is unlikely that an observational estimate of the disk s dissipation timescale by itself can distinguish between the competing theoretical models mentioned above , estimates of the dissipation timescale of the planet forming regions can impose valuable constraints on current theoretical models . in order to probe the planet - forming regions of disks around pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , mid- and far - ir observations",
    "are required .",
    "unfortunately , these spectral regions are not easily observable from the ground , and past space ir telescopes such as iras and iso were only sensitive enough to detect very bright optically thick disks in low - mass stars at the distance of nearest star - forming regions .",
    "these instruments lacked the sensitivity needed to detect the modest ir - excesses expected for optically thin disks and faint optically thick disks .",
    "thus , _ spitzer _",
    "s sensitivity is required to establish whether most wtts have optically thin disks , disks with inner holes , which are too cold to be detected in the near - ir from the ground , disks too faint to be detected by iras and iso , or no disks at all .",
    "one of the main goals of the _ spitzer _ legacy project `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ; evans et al .",
    "2003 ) is to determine whether or not most wtts have circumstellar disks and to characterize their properties and evolutionary status .",
    "preliminary results from the c2d legacy project ( padgett et al .",
    "2006 , p06 hereafter ) showed that disks are rare ( @xmath16@xmath2 ) among the population of wtts distributed _ around _ nearby molecular clouds .",
    "however , other recent _ spitzer _ studies have reported significantly larger disk fractions ( @xmath130@xmath2 ) among wtts in young clusters such as ic 348 and tr 37 ( lada et al . 2006 ; sicilia - aguilar et al 2006 ) . here",
    "we study a sample of over 230 spectroscopically identified wtts located in the c2d irac and mips maps of the lupus , ophiuchus , and perseus molecular clouds in order to investigate the frequency of circumstellar disks as a function of stellar age . in section 2",
    ", we describe the c2d survey of molecular clouds and our sample of wtts . in section 3 ,",
    "we identify ir excesses and investigate the properties of their disks . in section 4",
    ", we compare our results to previous _ spitzer _ results and discuss the evolutionary status of wtts disks .",
    "also in section 4 , we derive the ages of the wtts in our sample from their location in the h - r diagram .",
    "we investigate the disk frequency as a function of stellar age and use our results to impose constraints on the timescale for planet building .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "as part of the c2d legacy project , _ spitzer _ has mapped 13.0 sq . deg .",
    "of 3 nearby star - forming regions , perseus , ophiuchus , and lupus , with irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m ) and 22.1 sq .",
    "deg . with mips ( 24 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "mips 70 and 160 @xmath0 m observations were also taken , but due to sensitivity considerations , we do not include these observations in most of our analysis .",
    "the irac maps consist of two dithers of 10.4 sec observations , each obtained at two epochs ( 41.6 sec total ) separated by several hours .",
    "the second epoch observations were taken in the high dynamic range mode , which includes 0.4 sec observations before the 10.4 sec exposures , allowing photometry of both bright and faint stars at the same time .",
    "mips observations were taken with the fast scan mode , also in two different epochs of 15 sec exposures each .",
    "see jorgensen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and young et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a detailed description of the observing strategy used for the c2d irac and mips survey of nearby molecular clouds .",
    "in addition to the data from the c2d legacy project , we use observations of ic348 taken as part of the irac and mips guaranteed time observer ( gto ) programs ( program i d 36 and 58 , respectively ) .",
    "the irac gto observations cover a 15@xmath15x15@xmath15 field of view centered in the cluster and consists of two pairs of 8 dithers of 96.8 sec exposures for the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  observations ( e.g. 1549 sec exposures per pixel ) .",
    "the 8.0  observations consist of four pairs of 8 dithers of 46.8 sec exposures.m array , nominally 100 secs , consists of 2 exposures of 46.8 sec each ( see irac handbook , http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irac/dh/ ) . ]",
    "the mips 24 @xmath0 m gto observations of ic 348 were taken in the medium scan mode resulting in an average exposure time of 80 seconds per pixel .",
    "for consistency , we processed the basic calibrated data from the gto programs and produced point source catalogs using the c2d pipeline ( evans et al .",
    "the c2d pipeline uses the the c2d mosaicking / source extraction software c2dphot ( harvey et al . 2004 ) , which is based on the mosaicking program apex developed by the _ spitzer _ science center , and the source extractor dophot ( schechter et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "flux uncertainties in c2dphot are calculated in a standard way from a numerical estimate of the hessian matrix ( press et al .",
    "1992 ; silvia 1996 ) .",
    "this procedure for estimating uncertainties , although statistically correct , appears to underestimate the uncertainty as measured by the repeatability of flux measurements of the same objects at different epochs . for bright sources",
    ", there appears to be a random error floor to the best uncertainty possible with our observing techniques of 0.05 mag for the irac bands and 0.09 mag for the mips bands .",
    "the absolute calibration uncertainties are not included in our uncertainties .",
    "they are 5 and 10@xmath2 for irac and mips , respectively ( see data handbook for the instruments ) . as in",
    "most _ spitzer _ surveys , the intrinsic sensitivity of the c2d observations is not uniform across the clouds due to variations in the total exposure time at different positions in the sky , in the amount of extended cloud emission , and in the source confusion level . based on the cumulative fraction of all sources detected in both epochs of the c2d observations , the overall 90 @xmath2 completeness levels of the c2d survey",
    "have been estimated to be 0.07 , 0.12 , 0.5 , 0.4 , and 1.0 mjy for 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "see evans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a detailed discussion of the uncertainties and sensitivity limits of the c2d survey .",
    "the irac observations are sensitive enough to allow robust detections of stellar photospheres in all four irac bands for our entire sample of wtts in ophiuchus and lupus ( distance @xmath1125 pc and @xmath1150200 pc , respectively ) and in @xmath185@xmath2 of the objects in perseus ( distance @xmath1320 pc ) .",
    "mips 24 @xmath0 m observations are not deep enough to reach the stellar photosphere of some low mass objects ( especially in perseus , which is the most distant cloud we consider ) , but , in general , they are deep enough to detect optically thick disks in our entire sample .",
    "the different completeness levels of our disk census due to sensitivity considerations are discussed in more detail in section  [ completeness ] .",
    "the c2d maps contain several hundred young stars identified by their x - ray and @xmath7 brightness that have been spectroscopically classified as wtts stars .",
    "our sample was selected from the literature and is distributed as follows : 69 objects in ophiuchus ( bouvier @xmath14 appenzeller 1992 ; martin et al .",
    "1998 ) , 33 in lupus ( hughes et al .",
    "1994 ; krautter et al .",
    "1997 ) , and 130 objects in perseus ( luhman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the lupus and ophiuchus objects are distributed across the cloud maps , while the targets in perseus are located exclusively in the ic 348 cluster . of the 33 lupus objects ,",
    "27 are located in the c2d maps of lupus iii and 6 lie within the c2d maps of lupus i.    _ spitzer _ seds of the wtts in ic 348 have already been presented by lada et al .",
    "( 2006 , l06 hereafter ) .",
    "we include these objects in our sample because they increase the statistical significance of our results and allow us to compare a clustered population to the more distributed population of stars in lupus and ophiuchus .",
    "also , we adopt a different disk identification criterion than l06 , which results in a lower disk fraction than that obtained by the lada group ( see section  [ l06_comp ] ) . furthermore , l06 adopt a single age ( 2 - 3 myrs ) for the stars in the ic 348 cluster and do not attempt to study the disk fraction as function of age , which is one of the main goals of our paper .",
    "all the objects in our sample , which are listed in table 1 , have known spectral types and small @xmath7 ews .",
    "the spectral types are necessary to estimate stellar ages from the position of the targets in the h - r diagram and the contribution of the stellar photospheres to the observed seds , while the @xmath7 ews are required to establish wtts status .",
    "the nominal division between ctts and wtts is @xmath7 ew = 10 @xmath10 ; however , since the @xmath7 ew due to chromospheric activity alone can reach this value for late m stars ( e.g. , martin 1997 ) , we have included in our study 18 m2-m7 stars ( @xmath4 8 @xmath2 of our sample ) with @xmath7 ew up to 15 @xmath10 . also , @xmath18@xmath2 of the stars in our sample show @xmath7 in absorption rather than in emission .",
    "we note that even though there is a strong correlation between h@xmath16 emission and other accretion signatures such as optical veiling , a single - epoch low - resolution measurement of h@xmath16 equivalent width is not enough to rule out active accretion for at least two reasons .",
    "first , even when a narrow range of spectral types is considered , the distribution of h@xmath16 ews of t tauri stars does not show a clear gap between accreting and non - accreting objects ( e.g. , the @xmath7 ews of weakly accreting pms stars overlap with those of chromospherically active non - accreting stars ) .",
    "second , accretion itself is a highly variable process , and some objects constantly move across the wtts ",
    "ctts h@xmath16 ew boundary .",
    "therefore , we consider our sample to be composed of mostly non - accreting objects but do not rule out the presence of some actively accreting interlopers .      in order to construct more complete seds of our wtts ,",
    "we have collected the 2mass photometry for our entire sample and the v , @xmath17 , @xmath18-band photometry reported by hughes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and wichmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for 24 of our 33 lupus objects .",
    "also we have obtained our own v@xmath17@xmath18 optical observations for 52 of our 69 ophiuchus targets and r@xmath19 and i@xmath19-band observations for 115 of the 130 objects in ic 348 with the 0.8 m telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the ophiuchus targets were observed in 7 different 46@xmath202 x 46@xmath202 fields of view during the photometric nights of june @xmath21-@xmath22 2005 with exposures times of 30 , 50 , and 100 seconds for the v , @xmath17 , and @xmath18-band respectively .",
    "the objects in ic 348 were observed in a single field of view with 200 and 150 second exposures in the r@xmath19 and @xmath18-band , respectively .",
    "in addition to the program stars , on each night , 3 fields of landolt standards ( @xmath15 standards per field ) were observed at different airmasses .",
    "the seeing ranged from 1.5@xmath23 to 2@xmath23 when the observations were made .",
    "we reduced the data and perform aperture photometry using the standard iraf packages ccdred and daophot .",
    "we used a 5.4@xmath23 ( 4-pixel ) aperture and a sky annulus with inner and outer radii of 16.2@xmath23 and 22.95@xmath23 respectively .",
    "the rms scatter of the photometric solutions applied to the programs stars was @xmath4 0.02 mag in all three filters .",
    "we adopt a conservative _ minimum _ photometric error of 0.03 mag .",
    "we report the magnitudes and the uncertainties for all the objects with estimated photometric error less than @xmath10.2 mag .",

    "photometry for our entire sample is listed in table 1 . the non-_spitzer _ data : optical and 2mass photometry , along with the spectral types and h@xmath24 equivalent widths from the literature , is listed in table 2 .",
    "in order to identify the stars with disks , we compare the extinction - corrected _ spitzer _ colors of our targets , to those predicted by nextgen models ( hauschildt et al . 1999 ) , convolved with the _ spitzer _ bandpasses , for the photospheres of stars of the corresponding spectral types .",
    "the broader the wavelength baseline of the color used , the larger is the expected excess of the stars with disks ; therefore , the available color that provides the most clear disk identification is [ 3.6][24 ] .",
    "however , since both _",
    "spitzer s _ sensitivity and the photospheric fluxes decrease with increasing wavelength , not all sources are detected at wavelengths longer than 5.8 @xmath0 m .    in figure 1a , we plot [ 3.6 ] vs ex([3.6][24 ] ) , for the 98 stars with 3.6 and 24 @xmath0 m fluxes available , where ex([3.6][24 ] ) is ( [ 3.6][24])@xmath25-([3.6][24])@xmath26 , ( [ 3.6][24])@xmath25 are the observed colors corrected for extinction , and ( [ 3.6][24])@xmath26 are the photospheric colors predicted by the nextgen models .",

    "we use @xmath27=5.88@xmath29e(j - k@xmath30 ) .",
    "we note that this will result in an overestimated extinction for objects with significant k - band excess .",
    "the extinction at 8 and 24 @xmath0 m are calculated according to table 3 .",

    "the mean ex([3.6][24 ] ) value for this group is not zero but 0.07 mag with a 1-@xmath31 dispersion of 0.17 mag .",
    "the 0.07 mag offset of the observed stellar photospheres with respect to the models is probably due to a combination of the systematic errors in the absolute flux calibrations , the stellar models , and the extinction corrections . in figure 1a",
    ", we treat this offset by subtracting 0.07 mag from all the ex([3.6][24 ] ) values .",
    "we find that 40 objects have a [ 3.6][24 ] excesses larger than 5-@xmath31 .",
    "these are very robust disk identifications .",
    "one object , rxj1622.6 - 2345 , has [ 3.6][24 ] excess just over 3-@xmath31 .",
    "we consider this object to be a good disk candidate , but warn the reader of its lower significance .",
    "since the c2d mips maps cover a larger area than the irac maps , 24 @xmath0 m is the only _ spitzer _ flux available for 5 stars in our sample . in these cases ,",

    "following cieza @xmath14 baliber ( 2006 ) , objects with [ 3.6][8.0 ] @xmath4 0.7 are considered stellar photospheres . in this case , the mean color offset with respect to the models is 0.05 mag .",
    "the standard deviation of the stellar photospheres is 0.16 mag , but the error clearly increases with decreasing brightness .",

    "two objects , ic348 - 76 and ic348 - 67 , show excesses between 3 and 5-@xmath31 .",
    "since the seds of these two objects show a hint of ir - excess at 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath0 m , we consider these two objects to be good disk candidates .",
    "we find that none of the 15 objects without [ 3.6][24 ] , [ k@xmath30][24 ] , or [ 3.6][8.0 ] colors available shows a significant [ 3.6][5.8 ] excess .",

    ", we identify a total of 46 wtts disks and 3 disk candidates . for definiteness , we consider these 3 disk candidates to be real in the rest of the paper .",
    "however , we note that the completeness of our disk census is lower for our ic 348 sample than it is for the sample of lupus and ophiuchus wtts .",
    "the irac observations are sensitive enough to allow robust detections of stellar photospheres in all four irac bands for wtts in the sample from lupus and ophiuchus ( 102 objects in total ) . also ,",
    "the 5 objects in lupus and ophiuchus that fall outside the c2d irac maps all have 24 @xmath0 m fluxes consistent with stellar photospheres , which rules out the presence of any significant irac excess in these objects .",
    "therefore , the census of irac excesses in our sample of lupus and ophiuchus wtts is likely to be complete ( i.e. only 17 out of the 102 wtts in lupus and ophiuchus have significant irac excesses ) . at 24 @xmath0",

    "the longer integration times of the gto irac observations of ic 348 with respect to the c2d observation of lupus and ophiuchus ( 1548 vs. 46.8 secs ) more than compensates the effect of the distance ( 320 vs. 125200 pc ) on the expected sensitivities .",
    "however , the high background of the ic 348 cluster becomes the limiting factor for the detection of faint sources at 8.0 @xmath0 m . at 24 @xmath0 m ,",
    "the depth of the gto observations only partially compensates for the greater distance of ic 348 , and the effect of the background becomes even larger than it is at 8.0 @xmath0 m .",

    "we tried to present a disk census as complete as possible given the available data .",
    "however , since the sensitivity of our disk survey is not uniform across all wavelengths and varies from region to region due to distance and background level effects , we derive disk fraction statistics from the number of objects with excess at irac wavelengths ( irac disk fraction , hereafter ) in a magnitude limited subsamples that is not likely to be affected by sensitivity variations .",

    "thus , grains significantly smaller than 0.5 @xmath0 m are unbound and unlikely to be present in the disk .",

    "the best fits to the observed excesses around the three low - mass wtts ( rxj1622.6 - 2345 , ic348 - 56 and ic348 - 124 ) are also consistent with optically thin disks observed around other young m - type stars such as au mic ( liu et al .",

    "we derive the stellar luminosities by applying a bolometric correction ( appropriate for each spectral type ) to the 2mass j - band magnitudes corrected for extinction and assuming the nominal cloud distance listed in table 6 .",
    "the j - band was chosen because the effects of extinction is less important than at shorter wavelengths ( a@xmath109 @xmath1 0.26 a@xmath39 ) and the emission from the disk is less prominent that at longer wavelengths .",

    "the error bars associated with the ages we derive , we first estimate the observational uncertainties that need to be propagated through the h - r diagram . fortunately , the @xmath112 s and luminosities of wtts are easier to determine than those of ctts .",
    "the interplay between extinction and veiling introduces a large uncertainty in determining stellar luminosities of ctts , and different results are obtained depending on the band to which the bolometric correction is applied ( cieza et al .",
    "in fact , the luminosities obtained from the j - band are systematically larger ( by @xmath135@xmath2 ) than those obtained from the @xmath18 band . for wtts , cieza et al .",

    "similarly , the spectral type classification of wtts ( and therefore their temperatures ) is usually more accurate than that of ctts .",
    "this is because the spectra of ctts are affected by veiling , and their photospheres are highly heterogeneous in terms of temperature due to the presence of hot accretion columns . to estimate the effective temperature uncertainty of the wtts in our sample",
    ", we adopt one spectral type subclass as the classification accuracy . for the reasons mentioned above ,",
    "we regard the @xmath112 s and the luminosities ( and therefore the ages ) of wtts as being more accurate than those derived for ctts using the same procedure .",
    "a study of the disk fraction as a function of age can only yield meaningful results if the intrinsic age spread of the sample is larger than the age uncertainties attributable to observational errors .",
    "we verify that our sample satisfies this condition by comparing the spread of the ages we derive to that expected solely from observational errors .",
    "based on an error budget similar to the one described above , hartman ( 2001 ) estimated that observational errors will introduce an age spread of @xmath31log(age ) = 0.18 in the logarithmic age distribution derived for wtts in taurus . in figure 12 , we plot the derived age distribution of our sample as calculated from two different evolutionary tracks .",

    "( 2000 , s00 hereafter ) , the logarithmic age distribution of the sample can be characterized as a gaussian centered around log(age)=6.6 with @xmath31(log age ) = 0.40 .",
    "the age spreads derived are 2.2 - 3.2 times the value attributed by hartmann ( 2001 ) to observational errors , which is also shown in fig 13 for comparison .      in order to evaluate the degree",
    "to which ages we derive depends on the models , we compare the individual ages derived from the d98 and s00 models .",
    "we choose these two particular evolutionary tracks because they provide the appropriate mass and age range and are both widely used , which allows a direct comparison of our results to those from other papers .",
    "figure 13a shows the ages derived for our sample using both sets of evolutionary tracks .",
    "the error bars for every object have been calculated by propagating into the evolutionary tracks the _ observational _ uncertainties computed as described in the previous section ( e.g. a @xmath112 uncertainty equal to one spectral type subclass and a luminosity uncertainty dominated by the distance uncertainty ) .",
    "stellar ages of pms stars are very difficult to estimate due to the large observational and model uncertainties involved ( hillenbrand @xmath14 white , 2004 ) and they are often taken with a high degree of ( healthy ) skepticism . however , even though the the error bars in the individual ages are large , the total age spread in the sample is significantly larger than the typical ( observational ) error bar .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of figure 12 .",
    "also , even though d98 and s00 evolutionary tracks show some systematic differences ( e.g. d98 tracks yield significantly younger ages than s00 models ) , the relative ages agree fairly well .",
    "figure 13a shows that @xmath140@xmath2 of the wtts that are both younger than 1.5 myrs according to the s00 models _ and _ younger than 0.6 myrs according to the d98 models have circumstellar disks .",
    "in contrast , none of the targets that are older than 10 myrs according to the d98 _ or _",

    "the decrease in the irac disk fraction with stellar age is clearly seen figure 13b , where we restrict our analysis to the 198 objects in the magnitude limited subsample discussed in section  [ df_stats ] and divide the ages we derive using the d98 and s00 models into 4 age bins .",
    "very similar conclusions can be drawn if our sample is combined with that of p06 . including the p06 samples",

    "this timescale is very similar to that obtained by studies of the frequency of circumstellar disks detected in the near - ir ( see hillenbrand 2006 for a review ) .",
    "however , our results impose much stronger constraints on the time available for the formation of planets than those provided by previous studies .",
    "past results based on near - ir excesses always left room for the possibility that stars without near - ir excess had enough material to form planets at larger radii not probed by near - ir wavelengths .",
    "iras and iso had the appropriate wavelengths range to probe the planet - forming regions of the disk but lacked the sensitivity needed to detect all but the strongest mid- and far - ir excesses in low - mass stars at the distances of nearest star - forming regions .",
    "_ spitzer _ provides , for the first time , the wavelength coverage and the sensitivity needed to detect small amounts of dust in the planet - forming regions of a statistically significant number of low - mass pms stars . in particular , the results from section  [ disk_models ] suggest that 24 @xmath0 m fluxes consistent with stellar photospheres constrain the amount of _ warm _ dust ( t @xmath1100 k ) in the disks of our sample of wtts to be much less than an earth mass .",
    "even though our 24 @xmath0 m observations are not sensitive to the stellar photospheres of all the targets , taking the p06 sample and our sample together , there are at least @xmath140 wtts with estimated ages @xmath9 10 myrs showing photospheric fluxes at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "this number is likely to be a lower limit because , as discussed in section [ l06_comp ] , we suspect that the ages of many of the stars in the p06 sample have been underestimated .",
    "this seems to imply that after @xmath110 myrs wtts have to be in a relatively advanced stage of the planet formation process if they are to form planets at all .",
    "since the ctts disks older than 10 myrs are also very infrequent , 10 myrs seems to be a general upper limit for the survival of primordial disks around pms stars .",

    "<S> one of the central goals of the _ spitzer _ legacy project `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) is to determine the frequency of remnant circumstellar disks around weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) and to study the properties and evolutionary status of these disks . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a census of disks for a sample of over 230 spectroscopically identified wtts located in the c2d irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 4.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m ) and mips ( 24 @xmath0 m ) maps of the ophiuchus , lupus , and perseus molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath120@xmath2 of the wtts in a magnitude limited subsample have noticeable ir - excesses at irac wavelengths indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> the disk frequencies we find in these 3 regions are @xmath13 - 6 times larger than that recently found for a sample of 83 relatively isolated wtts located , for the most part , outside the highest extinction regions covered by the c2d irac and mips maps . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy in the disk fraction of these two different groups of wtts ( on cloud vs. off - cloud targets ) supports the idea that samples of wtts distributed _ around _ molecular clouds ( nominally 1 - 10 myrs old ) represent a somewhat older population of stars . </S>",
    "<S> the disk fractions we find are more consistent with those obtained in recent _ spitzer _ studies of wtts in young clusters such as ic 348 and tr 37 . from their location in the h - r diagram , we find that , in our sample , the wtts with excesses are among the younger part of the age distribution . still , up to @xmath150@xmath2 of the apparently youngest stars in the sample </S>",
    "<S> show no evidence of ir excess , suggesting that the circumstellar disks of a sizable fraction of pre - main - sequence stars dissipate in a timescale of @xmath11 myr . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that none of the stars in our sample apparently older than @xmath110 myrs have detectable circumstellar disks at wavelengths @xmath3 24 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> our result on the survival time of primordial disks is very similar to those obtained by studies based on k - band identified inner disks ( r @xmath4 0.1 au ) . also , we find that the wtts disks in our sample exhibit a wide range of properties ( sed morphology , inner radius , l@xmath5/l@xmath6 , etc ) which bridge the gaps observed between the ctts and the debris disk regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that wtts disks are in fact the link between the massive primordial disks found around ctts and the debris disks observed around main - sequence stars . </S>"
