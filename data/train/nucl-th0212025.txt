    "recent interest in the spectroscopic factors for the removal of low - lying @xmath1 and @xmath2 strength from @xmath0 points to a substantial discrepancy between experiment  @xcite and theory  @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the reduction of these spectroscopic factors due to short - range correlations is important and is uniformly calculated to be about 10% in @xmath0 using different realistic interactions and theoretical approaches .",
    "the best agreement with the data is obtained when also long - range correlations are included in the calculations  @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrate a particularly strong correlation between the theoretically calculated excitation spectrum of @xmath0 and the resulting one - hole spectral function , which describes the excitations of the residual @xmath3 nucleus .",
    "the appearance of an additional @xmath2 fragment at small missing energy when a low - lying excited @xmath4 state is obtained is one such correlation  @xcite .",
    "another one is the appearance of low - lying @xmath5 and @xmath6 strength when the first @xmath7 state in @xmath0 is correctly described  @xcite .",
    "both features are in accordance with the experimental data  @xcite .    the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite employed a random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach to describe the excitation spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "the quality of the spectrum in this approach is , however , quite inadequate .",
    "even with realistic @xmath8-matrices as residual particle - hole ( ph ) interaction one generates at most a few low - lying collective isoscalar states of negative parity ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) and no low - lying isoscalar positive parity states are obtained  @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that an adequate description of the sp fragmentation , at low energy , requires a better description of the excited states within the same framework of self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) .",
    "this improvement of the scgf method is also important because it can be applied to heavier nuclei .",
    "this is possible since the method describes the features of the low - energy spectrum in terms of interactions between a relatively small number of quasiparticles and collective excitations .",
    "these modes represent the experimentally observed excitations of the system and therefore they include both the effects of short- and long - range correlations .",
    "the fragmentation of the single - particle ( sp ) strength is thus self - consistently included .",
    "early applications to @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been reported in refs .",
    "these calculations did not include self - consistency but nevertheless were able to yield a reasonable description of giant resonances and gamow - teller states as well as the low - lying collective states . moreover a formalism based on the bethe - salpeter equation for ph excitations can be extended to include the effects of the continuum  @xcite .",
    "although the scgf method has only been applied in doubly closed - shell nuclei , it is feasible that increased computational power will allow applications to open - shell systems .",
    "an exploratory calculation for semi - magic isotopes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 was reported in  @xcite . in the near future",
    "a huge amount of data will become available for unstable nuclei from radioactive beam facilities .",
    "for this reason it is important to develop techniques that are flexible enough to describe all the above effects .    in this paper , we report a first step toward an extension of the scgf formalism in this direction .",
    "we chose to use @xmath0 as a test system for the following reasons .",
    "first , a successful calculation for this nucleus will help resolving the aforementioned discrepancies for the spectroscopic factors .",
    "second , this system has been studied by various approaches in the past . from the results of these calculations",
    "one can infer the relevant physical ingredients to be included in the scgf method .",
    "third , since the spectrum of @xmath0 is rather complicated , meeting the challenge of describing this system will virtually guarantee good results when the same method is applied to heavier nuclei .",
    "shell - model calculations for this nucleus have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite which indicate the particular importance of four - particle four - hole ( 4p4h ) admixtures to the 0p0h ground state in generating the first excited @xmath4 state .",
    "other positive parity states at low energy are dominated by 2p2h components , as indirectly confirmed by inelastic electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "some of this resulting physics was anticipated in terms of deformation effects which simulate these types of many - particle many - hole admixtures  @xcite .",
    "a complementary point of view is given by the interacting boson model of refs .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the low - lying positive parity states are understood in terms of the coupling of @xmath7 and @xmath9 isoscalar states .",
    "one should note that , due to the predominant 1p1h nature of these excitations , the coupling of different phonons generates the npnh configurations relevant to this problem . in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath7 and @xmath9 states were used as phenomenological boson degrees of freedom to generate the spectrum of the nucleus .",
    "the connection with the underlying fermionic description was indicated but not explored completely .",
    "this relation was considered in ref .",
    "there it was argued that the microscopic ph interaction contains two - phonon exchange contributions which include the actually observed low - lying states of @xmath0 themselves , thereby generating the correct number of low - lying states observed at low excitation energy .    in this work",
    "we begin to implement the physical ingredients proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite by extending the rpa to include the coupling to two - phonon states .",
    "the basic idea of the present approach is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pierpa ] .",
    "this figure depicts the coupling of a ph state to two intermediate phonons that are described by the ph propagator itself .",
    "if the two intermediate phonons have been computed using the rpa equations , they will already provide a reasonable description of the low - lying collective isoscalar @xmath7 and @xmath9 excited states .",
    "these phonons can be sufficient to generate the quantum numbers of the most important positive parity states .",
    "particularly relevant is the coupling of two @xmath7 phonons , @xmath14 , that represent some of the correlated 2p2h states of @xmath0 . in the framework of scgf one employs dressed sp propagator in the construction of the microscopic phonons .",
    "this results in a dressed rpa ( drpa ) approach for the ph calculation and in its extension to the coupling to two - phonon states . in the present paper",
    ", we employ the self - consistent sp propagator of @xmath0 computed in refs .",
    "it should be noted that the incorporation of all the 4p4h effects in the present formalism requires a full four - phonon calculation . for this reason , a complete resolution in terms of a microscopic description of the spectrum",
    "may only be partially successful .",
    "we note that there has been a tremendous progress in recent years in the microscopic description of _ p _ shell nuclei using green s function monte carlo and no - core shell model methods  @xcite",
    ". a possible application of the no - core shell model to @xmath0 would properly include such 4p4h effects .",
    "however the description of spectroscopic factors would still require the construction of effective operators to include the effects of short - range correlations on these quantities whereas these are automatically included in the scgf method .",

    "[ sec:2pierpa ] introduces the formalism to account for two - phonon coupling in the calculation of the ph propagator .",

    "the exact ph propagator  ( [ eq : pi ] ) is a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_eq ]  @xcite .",
    "this equation can be written schematically as @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the free propagation of a quasiparticle and a quasihole in the nuclear medium and the ph kernel @xmath26 is , in general , a four - time quantity . according to the baym - kadanoff procedure",
    ", a solution for @xmath27 is obtained by first generating a self - consistent solution of the sp propagator using a given choice of the self - energy . from the functional derivative of this ( self - consistent ) self - energy with respect to the corresponding sp propagator , one then obtains the irreducible ph interaction @xmath26 that generates the corresponding conserving approximation for the ph propagator ( when used in the bethe - salpeter equation ) .",
    "the standard rpa approach is derived by applying this procedure to the the hartree - fock ( hf ) sp propagator and self - energy .",
    "this corresponds to approximating @xmath26 with the bare interaction @xmath28 and employing bare ( hf ) sp propagators as external lines .",

    "@xcite , was suggested by the observed fragmentation of the sp strength and the necessity to go beyond a lowest - order self - energy for a commensurate theoretical description .",
    "there , the baym - kadanoff procedure is applied to a second - order approximation for the self - energy .",
    "this yields contributions to the kernel @xmath26 that automatically include all the terms which couple the ph states to the 2p2h ones , in accordance with the pauli principle for the latter states .",
    "thus , this formalism takes into account the mixing with 2p2h configurations in the construction of the ph propagator ( the diagram of fig .",

    "@xcite by means of a faddeev expansion for the nuclear self - energy .",
    "when one applies the baym - kadanoff prescription to the latter self - energy , a large set of contributions to @xmath26 is generated  @xcite . according to ref  @xcite",

    "there are sixteen such possible contributions , corresponding to all the possibilities of connecting two ph phonons to a ph state by means of a single interaction , both in the upper and lower part of the diagram .",

    "methods based on an rpa - like expansion produce an infinite series of diagrams in which the direction of propagation can be reversed from backward to forward and vice versa . in the case of standard ( d)rpa , the interaction kernel is simply given the potential @xmath28 and it is the same for every contribution to the diagrammatic expansion . therefore the usual ( d)rpa equation can be written in compact form , as in eq .",

    "this @xmath8-matrix was derived from a bonn - c potential  @xcite and computed according to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the contributions of two - phonon states were first studied by solving the erpa equation  ( [ eq:2pierpa ] ) with an independent - particle model ( ipm ) propagator .",
    "this propagator was constructed from a slater determinant composed of the lowest occupied harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) orbitals in the model space . where the effects of nuclear fragmentation were included , the calculations employed the fully dressed sp propagator computed in ref .",
    "this propagator contains no more than two main quasihole ( quasiparticle ) fragments for each state in the @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) shell . for these orbits ,",
    "the sp propagator can therefore be well represented by means of one or two principal fragments and an effective pole that accounts for strength far from the fermi energy . for quasiparticle states associated with the @xmath56 shell , instead , the fragmentation is more substantial  @xcite and the self - consistent propagator was approximated by including the most important poles ( up to 4 main fragments for the @xmath2 ) plus two effective ones that gather all the background strength .",

    "the calculations were performed by including , in each channel , all two - phonon configurations up to 30  mev .",

    "both @xmath7 and @xmath4 shifted down to about 0.5  mev above the experimental energy .",
    "as discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : furt_stab ] , this is to be considered rather fortuitous and one must remember that the dressing of the sp propagator , which has the effect to raise these eigenvalues , has not been taken into account yet . still , this result indicates that correlations between ph and two - phonon states can be substantial and go in the right direction in explaining the experimental results .",
    "it is also worth considering the total ph spectral strength of these states obtained by summing the corresponding amplitudes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : piampl_def ] ) , as follows @xmath59 results for both the excitation energy and @xmath60 of the principal levels in fig .",

    "note that @xmath60 is substantially bigger than one for the @xmath7 and @xmath4 states and that these values increase further for the erpa results .",
    "this signals an increase of the collective character of these solutions which may lead to an instability of the rpa equations for interactions that are even more attractive .",
    "the two - phonon erpa approach generates a triplet of states at about 14  mev , with quantum numbers @xmath4 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , these levels are almost exclusively composed of two - phonon contributions and contain only small admixtures of ph states , resulting in a small ph spectral strength   @xmath60 . the quantum numbers and energies of these states indeed correspond closely to those obtained by coupling two @xmath7 rpa phonons , each at 7.14  mev .",
    "we note that a similar triplet is found experimentally at 12.05 , 11.52 and 11.10  mev , which also corresponds to twice the experimental energy of the first @xmath7 phonon .",
    "the first experimental @xmath61 is found at lower energy and its spectral strength is known to have relevant ph components  @xcite .",
    "thus it can not be identified with any of the above two - phonon contribution .",
    "for all the lowest states that are not already reproduced by standard rpa a very small ph spectral strength has been found , due to a general lack of mixing between the ph and the two - phonon configurations .",
    "of interest is also the @xmath61 that represents the giant quadrupole resonance at 20.7  mev . in this case rpa and erpa",
    "give 22.9 and 23.3  mev for the main peak but with a lower @xmath60 in the second case .",
    "for this state , part of the ph strength ( about 20% ) is shifted to two - phonon configurations representing the expected fragmentation of the giant resonance .",
    "[ fig:2pierpa_3 g ] and table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] show the analogous results when dressed sp propagators are used as input . in general , the main effect of fragmentation is to screen the nuclear interaction as a consequence of the quenching of spectroscopic factors for the input sp propagator .",
    "for the drpa case , this results in increasing the lowest @xmath7 and @xmath9 solutions by @xmath632  mev .",
    "more substantial is the effect on the lowest @xmath4 state with a predominantly ph character which rises to about 17  mev , confirming the sensitivity of this state to details of the fragmentation and the strength of the nuclear interaction . unlike the ipm case ,",
    "we have chosen to solve the two - phonon erpa by first shifting the lowest solution for both the @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 states down to their relative experimental energies .",
    "this has the advantage of lowering the most important two - phonon configurations and allows to investigate their interplay with the ph ones .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pierpa_3 g ] , the erpa equations still generate a triplet of @xmath4 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 states at twice the energy of the first @xmath7 phonon . due to the screening of the ph interaction , these states mix very little with the ph configurations yielding an almost degenerate triplet .",
    "table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] also gives a comparison between the total two - phonon content of the states and the individual contributions of the most important configurations .",
    "this decomposition demonstrates that this triplet is formed by pure @xmath64 states .",
    "this observation is in accordance with the 2p2h character of these states  @xcite .",
    "since the overall energy of these states approximately agrees with experiment , one can expect that this calculation correctly represents the bulk properties of their wavefunctions .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that an additional interaction is needed in order to split this triplet as observed experimentally .",
    "it should be noted that no solution that can be identified with the @xmath61 and @xmath62 levels at 9.8 and 10.4  mev . the @xmath61 level has been interpreted in terms of an @xmath23 particle rotating around an excited @xmath65 core  @xcite and",
    "therefore involves correlations that may go well beyond the present calculation . with regard to the @xmath61 strength around 20  mev",
    ", we note that the sp fragmentation included in the drpa equation already generates a distribution of @xmath61 strength .",
    "table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] contains a few of these solutions and shows that also for the dressed case a sizable mixing of ph and two - phonon contributions is obtained at this energy .",
    "this mixing generates the spreading of ph strength over different solutions , consistent with the finite width of such a resonant state .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a discrete basis is used here and therefore it is not possible to properly describe the continuous strength distribution of a giant resonance , for which a continuum or a complex basis should be used  @xcite .",
    "also interesting are the results for the other isoscalar @xmath4 states .",
    "the lowest solution with a predominant ph character , that was found in drpa at @xmath6317  mev , is obtained at a similar energy but is now characterized by a partial mixing with two - phonon configurations .",
    "the ph and two - phonon contents of this state given in table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] show that this is the result of mixing with the the lowest solution , which ends up at @xmath6311  mev .",
    "the latter is predominately a two - phonon state .",
    "it is also seen that in both cases the relevant configuration comes from the coupling of two @xmath4 phonons .",
    "configurations involving two @xmath7 s make smaller contributions while the other modes not reported in the table were negligible .",
    "we note that the wavefunctions for these states contain several relevant ph configurations , obtained from different quasiparticle fragments in the @xmath56  ( @xmath55 ) shells combined with quasihole fragments of the @xmath54  ( @xmath66 ) shells .",
    "therefore , the situation is more complicated than the simple picture of only two levels interacting with each other .",
    "we observe that the shell - model calculations for the first excited state of @xmath0 give very small contributions from both 0@xmath67 and 2@xmath67 configurations and a strong population of 4@xmath67 states  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , inelastic electron scattering experiments  @xcite clearly excite this state identifying its partial ph character even though the state is dominated by 4p4h components . from the point of view of the scgf approach ,",
    "the one - body response is completely described by the ( dressed ) ph propagator , eq .",
    "( [ eq : drpa ] ) , and therefore the total one - body strength must be represented by @xmath60  ( [ eq : z_tot_ph ] ) .",
    "this observation points to the necessity of a stronger mixing between ph and two - phonon configurations than obtained in the present calculations .",
    "still , the present results indicate that the two - phonon configuration obtained by coupling the two lowest @xmath4 phonons plays a role in the structure of the first @xmath4 state itself .",
    "this means that , starting from the dressed ph admixture contained in it , a fully self - consistent calculation would also generate some contributions of 2p2h , 4p4h , and beyond .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that the bulk of the 4p4h contributions to the first excited state of @xmath0 may come from the coupling of four different phonons with negative parity ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , the self - consistent role of coupling positive parity states was not conidered in that work .",
    "both this effect , the rpa correlations and the inclusion of the nuclear fragmentation allow for the at least partial inclusion of configurations beyond the 2p2h case even when no more than two - phonon coupling is considered , as in this paper .",
    "a study of the importance of three- and four - phonon configurations within this approach is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the principal negative parity isoscalar states are still shifted down in energy by erpa over drpa , as expected , but the improvement is less than 0.5  mev .",
    "the low - lying @xmath7 and @xmath9 levels remain substantially above the experimental energy at 9.23 and 10.90  mev , respectively , and more correlations will be needed in order to lower their energy .",
    "we note that these wavefunctions contain a two - phonon admixture obtained by coupling the low - lying @xmath4 excitation to either the @xmath7 or @xmath9 phonons .",
    "according to the above interpretation of the first @xmath4 excited state this corresponds to the inclusion of 3p3h and beyond . at the same time two additional negative parity solutions , with two - phonon character , are found at higher energy in accordance with experiment .",
    "the erpa results for an h.o .",
    "input give appropriate corrections to several energy levels .",
    "however , such corrections tend to become negligible in the successive calculations employing dressed propagators .",
    "presumably this happens because a sizable part of the correlations , which in the latter case are introduced by erpa , are already accounted for by the dressing of the sp propagators . in general , the inclusion of fragmentation has also the effect of screening the interaction between ph and two - phonon configurations .",
    "however , the results of table  [ tab:2pierpa_3 g ] show that a considerable mixing between the two can be obtained if all the relevant configurations are sufficiently low in energy , although no substantial mixing between different two - phonons states is seen .",
    "according to these considerations , the biggest deficiency of the present approach is probably the lack of an interaction within the multi - phonon space . refs .",
    "@xcite have shown that such correlations are due to pp and hh interactions , neglected here , and that their inclusion has important effects on the final result for the spectrum .",
    "these terms may considerably lower most of the eigenstates of the erpa equations .",
    "however , a second type of correlation between multi - phonon states , that was not accounted for in refs .",
    "@xcite , is the pauli exchange between the fermion lines included in different phonon propagators .",
    "these will probably generate the opposite effect , screening part of the pp and hh correlations .",
    "although the results obtained with a dressed input propagator for the lowest excited states are not completely successful , it must be recognized that the present erpa calculation does represent a step forward .",
    "indeed a proper description of two - phonon contributions , at the present level , had not been accomplished before .",
    "these states not only account for configurations at the 2p2h and higher level but appear to have some relevance for the description of states at higher energy .",
    "in addition , excitations are generated with quantum numbers that can not be obtained in the standard ( d)rpa approach at these low energies .",
    "given the results of the present work , it appears that a calculation including both pp and hh correlations , a more complete treatment of pauli effects and the most relevant configurations up to the four - phonon states can be achieved with the presnt - day computers .",
    "such a calculation is planned for the future .",
    "the rpa approach may break down for strongly attractive interactions , by genereating an excess of collectivity and lowering the first excited state below the ground - state energy .",
    "the inclusion of fragmentation of the sp strength can affect this behavior in several ways .",
    "first , both the screening of the nuclear interaction and the splitting of the particle and hole spectral strengths over different fragments tends to stabilize the drpa equations .",
    "second , correlations lower most of the sp energies in comparison with the ipm .",
    "this results in smaller unperturbed ph energies and therefore has the opposite effect of pushing the drpa approach toward instability .",
    "third , the instability can be sensitive to the details of the spectroscopic amplitudes .",
    "this last point can be best illustrated by looking at the sp strength with @xmath68 , to which the present calculation is most sensitive .",
    "for the model space employed in this work a given particle overlap function is a superposition of two h.o .",
    "eigenstates , @xmath69 where we have stressed the fact the two components can sum either constructively or destructively .",

    "( [ eq : drpa - bmtx ] ) one can see that the ph interaction for the drpa approach can be substantially changed by this new component by virtue of the strong matrix elements of the effective interaction between @xmath72 states .",
    "in particular , this also applies to the off - diagonal terms that drive the rpa - like correlations .",
    "it is also worth nothing that the sign of this correction changes accordingly to the relative sign of the components in eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) , therefore pushing the states either towards stability or instability , respectively .",
    "we have observed that choosing a wrong sign for one or more of the @xmath2 particle fragments has drastic effects for the solutions of the isoscalar @xmath4 channel , with the choice of constructive interference in eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) leading toward instability of the drpa approach . for the input propagator employed in this work ,",
    "all of the background fragments have a similar wavefunction and a negative or positive interference sign according to whether their sp energy is lower or higher than 20  mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to collect such background distributions in two different poles , one for each region of missing energy .",
    "a similar behavior applies also to the other quasiparticle states in the @xmath58 and @xmath55 shells .",
    "we have checked that the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] are stable with respect to the number of main fragments and effective poles included in each subshell , therefore no instability affects the present work .",
    "however , in applications in which the number of poles has to be strongly reduced it may not be possible to chose effective poles of the sp propagator that represent the details of the spectral distribution sufficiently accurately . in such a case an instability in the drpa approach may arise .",

    "<S> a microscopic formalism is developed that includes the coupling to two particle - hole phonons in the particle - hole propagator by extending the dressed random phase approximation ( drpa ) equation for a finite system . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting formalism is applied to study the low - lying excitation spectrum of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the coupling to two - phonon states at low energy generates excited states with quantum numbers that can not be obtained in the drpa approach . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the two - phonon states mix weakly with particle - hole configurations and participate only partially in the formation of the lowest - lying positive - parity excited states . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the present calculation is tested vs. the truncation of model space . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that when single - particle strength fragmentation is properly considered , the present formalism exhibits convergence with respect to the chosen model space within the confines of the chosen approximation scheme . </S>"
