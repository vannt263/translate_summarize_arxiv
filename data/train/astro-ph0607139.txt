    "the angular distribution of satellite galaxies has received much recent attention .",
    "the topic was first addressed by holmberg ( 1969 ) , who found that satellites of spiral galaxies with projected separations @xmath1kpc are preferentially located near the short axes of their host galaxies .",
    "zaritsky et al .",

    "the satellite galaxies of the local group exhibit a similar anisotropy ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1982 ; majewski 1994 ; hartwick 1996 ) , and this may have important consequences for galaxy formation theory ( e.g. , kang et al .",

    "sales & lambas ( 2004 ) reported a statistically - significant alignment along the minor axes of host galaxies ; however , yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have since shown that this result was due to a misinterpretation of the position angle definition in the 2dfgrs database and that the alignment is actually along host _ major _ axes . moreover , the sales & lambas ( 2004 ) alignment was only in a subsample of hosts with little active star formation and satellites with small velocities relative to their hosts , @xmath4kms@xmath5 . for a subsample with larger relative velocities ( @xmath6kms@xmath5 ) ,",

( 2006 ) , using groups of galaxies from the sdss dr2 identified via a halo - based group finder from which halo properties for groups are inferred ( weinmann et al . 2005 ; yang et al . 2005 ) , found an alignment of satellites with host major axes , becoming more pronounced at small separations .",

    "our aim is to study the angular distribution of satellites about isolated host galaxies with the increased statistics afforded by the sdss fourth data release ( dr4 ) .",
    "our study complements that of yang et al . (",
    "2006 ) , in the sense that we focus on isolated hosts instead of galaxy groups .",
    "we refer to central host galaxies as `` primary galaxies '' or simply `` primaries . ''",
    "provided primaries are selected in a consistent and homogeneous way , it is useful to consider all satellites as satellites of a single , fictitious primary in order to overcome the small numbers of satellites about individual primaries .",
    "the data we use are from the latest sdss public release , dr4 .",

    "these effects may bias results for satellites at projected distances @xmath7kpc from their hosts .",
    "for this reason , we perform our analysis on two subsamples .",
    "first , we include all satellites with @xmath17kpc to maximize the sample size while avoiding hii - region or bulge - structure contamination .",
    "we repeat the analysis on a subsample of satellites with @xmath18kpc , and check for consistency . for the purposes of the present work we select two main samples from dr4 and split these into several subsets as we now specify .",
    "sample  1 is built using the criteria from the first sample of brainerd ( 2005 ) : ( 1 ) hosts are at least 2.5 times ( 1 mag ) brighter than any other galaxy within a projected distance @xmath19kpc and a line - of - sight velocity difference @xmath20kms@xmath5 ; ( 2 ) satellites are at least 6.25 times ( 2 mag ) fainter than their hosts and are found within @xmath21kpc , and @xmath22kms@xmath5 .",

    "a summary of the sample selection criteria is given in table  [ table0 ] .",
    "the objects in each sample are subject to the additional criteria that 1 ) the ellipticity @xmath26 ( to ensure that the position angle is well defined ) , and 2 ) the primary absolute magnitude is constrained to a bin which we set by inspecting the distribution of primary @xmath27 magnitudes .",
    "this distribution is consistent with a gaussian with mean @xmath28 and standard deviation @xmath29 for sample  1 and mean @xmath30 with standard deviation @xmath31 for sample  2 .",
    "we set the bin to @xmath32 for both samples .",
    "sdss dr4 affords larger samples than previous studies .",
    "sample  1 ( prior to magnitude restrictions ) contains @xmath33 satellites around @xmath34 primaries , roughly @xmath35% more than sales & lambas ( 2004 ) or brainerd ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , we apply a magnitude selection that reduces the final size of sample  1 to @xmath36 satellites which is only slightly ( @xmath37% ) larger than the aforementioned studies . though the magnitude constraint lowers our statistics , by limiting the primary absolute magnitudes we aim to select a small range of primary masses so that the systems are comparable in terms of their typical dynamical states , masses , and formation histories .",
    "we split each primary sample into subsets of red or blue satellites about either red or blue primaries ( summarized in table  [ table1 ] and table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath38 color distributions of the primaries and satellites are shown in fig .",
    "[ g - rs1 ] for sample  1 and in fig .",
    "[ g - rs2 ] for sample  2 .",
    "the bimodality of the distribution is evident ( see strateva et al . 2001 , baldry et al .",
    "2004 ) , with the red peak dominating both the primary and satellite distributions .",
    "the local minima between the peaks of the color distributions occur near @xmath39 for the primaries and @xmath40 for the satellites , and we use these boundaries to construct blue and red subsamples of each population .",
    "we assign each satellite an angular position @xmath41 , defined as the angle between the primary major axis and the line joining the centre of the primary and the satellite . exploiting the assumed symmetry , we reduce the angle @xmath41 to the first quadrant so that @xmath42 .",
    "we take the position angles of the primaries from the sdss data as the 25-mag - isophote major axis , and compute @xmath41 using this position angle and the coordinates of the objects .",
    "we explicitly confirmed the position angles and @xmath41 values for a number of random images of satellite - primary pairs .",
    ".selection criteria for sample  1 and sample  2 .",
    "primaries @xmath43 is the minimum difference in @xmath27 magnitude with the nearest neighbor , satellites @xmath43 is the maximum difference in @xmath27 magnitude with the host ; primaries @xmath44 is the minimum projected distance between primaries , satellites @xmath44 is the maximum projected distance from the host ; primaries @xmath45 is the minimum recessional velocity difference between hosts , satellites @xmath45 is the maximum velocity difference with the host .

    "however , interlopers should not be associated with specific primaries in any meaningful way so that they should only serve to dilute the anisotropy that we measure .",
    "in fact , azzaro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrated this explicitly on mock catalogs constructed from cosmological numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , our findings should only be reinforced upon undertaking some ( reliable ) method for interloper removal .    broadly speaking , we confirm the major axis alignment recently found by other authors . in particular , we extend the results of yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to isolated systems .",
    "we find that angular distributions depend on both primary and satellite color .",
    "red primaries have anisotropic satellite distributions with satellites aligned with the major axes of their hosts and red satellites of red primaries show the strongest such alignment .",
    "blue primaries have distributions consistent with isotropy .",
    "however , we have shown that the sample size of blue primaries is insufficient to detect any anisotropy _ assuming _ an underlying distribution with the same level of anisotropy as the red primary sample .",
    "we determine this by constructing random subsamples of the population of satellites about red primaries that had the same size as the sample of satellites about blue primaries and re - analyzing these subsamples as independent samples .",
    "unlike brainerd ( 2005 ) and sales & lambas ( 2004 ) , we find a statistically - significant anisotropy for satellites at both large projected separations @xmath47kpc and large relative velocities @xmath48,km / s indicating that this preferential alignment is a rather general feature of satellites about red , or early - type primaries .",
