    "the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the most powerful probe of our universe because the anisotropies encode a wealth of cosmological information and the physical processes involved in anisotropy formation are well understood by linear perturbation theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , high - precision measurements of the primary cmb anisotropies enable us to determine a lot of fundamental cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , gravitational lensing due to the large - scale structure between the last scattering surface ( lss ) and us deforms the 2d sky map of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the weak lensing will be in the near future an effective tool for mapping the inhomogeneous distributions of dark matter because it is not affected by uncertainties in the `` biasing '' problem regarding the extent to which luminous objects trace the mass distribution .",
    "furthermore , a great advantage in studying the lensing effect on the cmb anisotropies is that statistical properties of the unlensed cmb field can be fully specified once we assume the field obeys the gaussian random theory ( @xcite , hereafter bbks ; @xcite hereafter be ) .",
    "most inflationary scenarios indeed support this assumption .",
    "however , most previous studies have focused on theoretical predictions of lensed shapes of the two - point correlation function @xmath0 or equivalently the angular power spectrum @xmath1 of the temperature fluctuations field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; cayn , martez - gonzlez & sanz 1993a , b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while some studies have shown that the lensing induces non - gaussian signatures ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore worth exploring an other statistical cmb estimator sensitive to the lensing signatures using more directly the advantage of predictability of the 2d cmb sky map .",
    "recently , heavens and sheth ( 1999 , hereafter hs ) investigated the two - point correlation function of local maxima ( _ hotspots _ ) above a certain threshold in the 2d cmb map , say @xmath2 , which can be accurately calculated based on the gaussian random theory once @xmath1 is given .",
    "their purpose was to propose that @xmath3 can be a powerful test of the gaussian hypothesis of the temperature fluctuations , and they showed that the shape of @xmath3 is largely different from that of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath2 has oscillatory features such as the depression around the angular scale corresponding to the 1st doppler peak of @xmath1 and a prominent peak with a damping tail toward the smaller scales than the peak - scale .",
    "the reasons can be explained as follows . in the derivation of @xmath2 , we need statistical properties of the gradient and second derivative fields of the temperature fluctuations field in order to identify the local maxima in the 2d cmb map .",
    "the shape of @xmath2 thus reflects more strongly the oscillatory features of @xmath1 such as a series of doppler peaks than @xmath0 does , because the gradient and the second derivative fields are more sensitive to the oscillations of @xmath1 . the oscillations of @xmath2 physically mean that the hotspots are discretely distributed with some _ characteristic _ angular separations on the lss .",
    "then , the weak lensing due to the large - scale structure causes the pairs of hotspots separated with the characteristic scale on the lss to be observed with various separations in the random line of sight .",
    "this leads to the expectation that @xmath2 enables us to see more directly the lensing dispersion of the specific angular separation than using @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this letter is therefore to develop the formula for calculating the lensing effect on @xmath2 using the power spectrum approach to compute the dispersion of the lensing deflection angle ( @xcite ) , and to present some results in the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model .",
    "during the propagation from the lss to us , a cmb photon is randomly deflected by the inhomogeneous matter distributions in the intervening large - scale structure .",
    "then , two cmb photons observed with a certain angular separation @xmath4 have a different separation when emitted on the lss . if we assume that the lensing fluctuations of the relative angular separation , @xmath5 , obey the gaussian random statistics ( @xcite ) , the ensemble average of the following characteristic function can be calculated as @xmath6}\\right\\rangle } _ { |{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_1 -{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_2|=\\theta}\\simeq   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{l^2}{2}\\sigma^2_{\\rm gl}(\\theta)\\right ] , \\label{eqn : avergl}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the angular excursions of the two photons , and @xmath9 denotes the average performed over all pairs with a fixed observed angular separation @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a conformal time , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the bessel function of order @xmath15 , and the subscript @xmath16 and `` rec '' denote values at present and a recombination time , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the power spectrum of the matter fluctuations , @xmath18 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the present hubble parameter and the present energy density of matter , respectively . the projection operator @xmath21 on the celestial sphere is given by @xmath22 in a flat universe .",
    "the approximation used in the derivation of equation ( [ eqn : avergl ] ) is valid as long as the @xmath23 is satisfied , and we numerically confirmed @xmath24 on the relevant angular scales for all normalizations of matter power spectrum considered in this letter .",
    "the unlensed @xmath0 in the context of the small angle approximation developed by be is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the 2d power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations field , @xmath28 , is identical to @xmath1 in the limit of @xmath29 .",
    "first , we briefly present the derivation of the unlensed two - point correlation function of hotspots in the 2d gaussian random cmb field developed by hs .",
    "the moments of power spectrum are defined by @xmath30 at a hotspot , the gradients of temperature fluctuations field , @xmath31 , vanish and the eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix , @xmath32 , are negative .",
    "we thus need 6 independent variables @xmath33 to specify one local hotspot .",
    "the probability density function of the 12 variables @xmath34 for the two hotspots separated with the angle @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the covariance matrix : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the inverse of @xmath37 . note that @xmath41 in the present case .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce the variables defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 all non - zero components of @xmath37 for two hotspots characterized by @xmath44 and @xmath45 and so on were explicitly calculated by hs . employing the bbks formalism ,",
    "we can obtain the following unlensed correlation function of two hotspots above certain thresholds @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the number density filed and the mean number density of hotspots above height @xmath52 , respectively . to obtain @xmath3",
    ", we performed a 6d numerical integration of equation ( [ eqn : xi ] ) because the two can be done analytically .",
    "next , we derive the lensed correlation function of hotspots . in this letter",
    ", we focus on the lensing contributions to @xmath3 as a secondary effect which comes from a mapping of the intrinsic discrete distributions of hotspots on the lss .",
    "the procedure is appropriate because a power of anisotropies generated by the lensing is small ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for this purpose",
    ", we define the fluctuations field of @xmath50 as @xmath53 .",
    "likewise , since the gravitational lensing makes us to observe , at a certain angular position @xmath54 , a hotspot at a different position @xmath55 on the lss , the lensed ( observed ) fluctuations field @xmath56 can be expressed as @xmath57 , $ ] where @xmath58 is the fourier component of @xmath59 .",
    "if assuming that the lensing fluctuations and the intrinsic cmb anisotropies field are statistically independent , then the lensed two - point correlation function of hotspots can be calculated with help of equation ( [ eqn : avergl ] ) as @xmath60 i_0\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta\\theta'}{\\sigma_{\\rm gl}^2(\\theta)}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : lensxi}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the modified zeroth - order bessel function .",
    "this equation indicates that the lensing contribution at a certain scale @xmath4 arises only from the lensing dispersion @xmath62 at the same scale alone .",
    "hence detecting the scale dependence of the lensing contributions to @xmath2 enables us to reconstruct the lensing dispersion , more importantly the projected matter power spectrum by equation ( [ eqn : gldisp ] ) .",
    "in the following , we show some results in the scdm model with @xmath63 . the hubble parameter and the present baryon density are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . to compute the intrinsic cmb angular power spectrum , @xmath28",
    ", we used the cmbfast code developed by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) .",
    "as for the matter power spectrum in the lensing dispersion ( [ eqn : gldisp ] ) , we employed the harrison - zeldovich spectrum and the bbks transfer function with the shape parameter in sugiyama ( 1995 ) .",
    "a free parameter in our model is only the normalization of the present - day matter power spectrum which is conventionally expressed in terms of the rms mass fluctuations within a sphere of @xmath66mpc , i.e. , @xmath67 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scdmxi ] , we show the two - pint correlation function of hotspots of height above the threshold @xmath68 with and without gravitational lensing effect , @xmath69 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that the intrinsic @xmath2 can be calculated by using only @xmath1 .",
    "the mean number density of hotspots is then @xmath70 .",
    "the dependence of the lensing effect on the normalization of mass fluctuations is demonstrated by the four choices of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 roughly correspond to normalizations of the cluster abundance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the cobe measurements ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the figure clearly shows that @xmath2 has more oscillatory features than @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the gradient and second derivative fields of @xmath74 used in the derivation of @xmath2 have power spectra of @xmath75 and @xmath76 per logarithmic interval in @xmath77 , respectively , and thus they strongly enhance the oscillations of @xmath78 , while @xmath0 is fully determined by @xmath78 . if using the relation @xmath79 , there are indeed correspondences between both oscillations of @xmath2 and @xmath80 such as the depression at @xmath81 corresponding to the scales around the 1st doppler peak of @xmath1 , a prominent peak at @xmath82 , and a damping tail at @xmath83 associated with the silk damping .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : scdmxi ] shows that the gravitational lensing appears as a larger smoothing at scales where @xmath84 has more oscillatory features , since pairs of hotspots separated with the characteristic angular scales corresponding to the oscillations of @xmath85 are redistributed by the weak lensing and thus power of @xmath2 is transfered from ( or to ) the scale to ( or from ) nearby scales .",
    "especially , it should be stressed that even the lensing effect on the depression at @xmath81 associated with the 1st doppler peak of @xmath1 is distinguishable where the deviation @xmath86 reaches up to @xmath87 for @xmath88 while @xmath89 in all cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compxi ] ) . since both @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    "give the same results as the shape becomes flat on larger scales ( @xmath92 ) , the large scale amplitude of @xmath85 gives the normalization independent of the lensing contributions .",
    "we also demonstrate the nonlinear corrections to the matter power spectrum to clarify how the nonlinear evolution of matter fluctuations affects our analysis . using the semi - analytic formulae developed by peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) for the extreme case of @xmath93 , where the universe has too large power of the present - day small - scale matter fluctuations",
    ", we found that the nonlinear correction is small at @xmath94 .",
    "most importantly , fig .",
    "[ fig : scdmxi ] indicates that the magnitude of the lensing contributions to @xmath85 is fairly sensitive to the amplitude of @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , measuring scale - dependence of the lensing contributions such as @xmath95 at @xmath96 will allow us to reconstruct the shape of projected power spectrum of matter fluctuations in the range of @xmath97 .",
    "in this letter , we have investigated the weak lensing effect on the two - point correlation of hotspots in the cmb .",
    "one of the great advantages in studying the lensing effect on the cmb anisotropies is that statistical properties of unlensed cmb field are fully predictable by the gaussian random theory .",
    "for example , bernardeau ( 1998 ) have investigated how the lensing changes probability distributions of the ellipticity defined from the local temperature curvature matrix , and shown that the method can be a statistical indicator sensitive to the lensing signatures .",
    "it is now expected that the weak lensing can be a powerful probe for measuring the power spectrum of matter fluctuations . in case of the normalization based on measurements of the large angular scale cmb anisotropies such as cobe normalization ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "we need to employ the very accurate matter transfer function which highly depends on a lot of cosmological parameters in order to determine the amplitude of small scale matter fluctuations .",
    "in fact , even most sensitive future experiments such as the _ planck surveyor _ ( @xcite ) will constrain @xmath67 up to only @xmath98 accuracy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus wish to propose that @xmath2 can be a new effective statistical tool for measuring amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum .    for this purpose , we have to perform quantitative predictions whether or not the future satellite missions , _ map _ ( @xcite ) and _ planck _ , can measure the lensing contributions to @xmath2 and constrain @xmath67 with high accuracy .",
    "in particular , we have to estimate not only uncertainties by the cosmic variance but also observational errors in identifying angular positions of hotspots in a realistic 2d sky map of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "it is then important to take into account the following experimental effects .",
    "( 1 ) the finite beam size of detectors may incorporate some hotspots within the beam size resulting from smoothing of the lensed cmb anisotropies filed .",
    "the effect hence decreases the mean number density of hotspots and suppresses two - point correlations of hotspots on scales below the beam size .",
    "( 2 ) the detector noise may make spurious hotspots in the observed cmb map .",
    "hs estimated the errors for measurements of the unlensed hotspots correlation functions expected from _ map _ and _ planck _ by using numerical sky realizations , and indeed showed that the theoretical predictions including the above experimental effects are in good agreement with the numerical results . following their method",
    ", we are now investigating the detectability of the lensing signatures to @xmath2 , and have obtained the preliminary result as follows . supposing the data produced by the _ planck _",
    "specification with @xmath99 sky coverage , the expected signal to noise ratios for the lensing signatures are @xmath100 and @xmath101 at @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , for @xmath104 model .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the statistical significance of @xmath105 could be increased by combining measurements of the two - point correlations of _ coldspots_. the observed correlations of coldspots should be identical to that of hotspots since they are subject to the gaussian random statistics .",
    "these works are now in progress and will be presented in detail elsewhere .",
    "we finally comment on possibilities that the lensing effect on @xmath85 breaks the so - called _ geometrical degeneracy _",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) inherent in cosmological parameter determinations from measurements of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "we have confirmed that the global shape of @xmath2 is sensitive to fundamental cosmological parameters such as @xmath106 and so on .",
    "we thus expect that detecting @xmath4-dependence of the lensing contributions to @xmath69 can yield an additional constraint on the @xmath107 plane if we assume the shape of matter power spectrum .",
    "hence , the degeneracy could be broken by observations of the cmb anisotropies alone , without help of other astronomical measurements .",

    "we also would like to acknowledge matias zaldarriaga and uros seljak for making available their cmbfast code . e.k .",
