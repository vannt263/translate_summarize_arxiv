    "the statistical study of chain models of polymer molecules @xcite have led to a collection of constitutive relations for the description of the elastic properties of polymer solutions @xcite , known as fene dumbbell models , in which the restoring force depends on the end - to - end vector of the chain . by avoiding",

    "numerical simulations of molecular chain models have shown that the fene approximation is useful to describe systems under flow conditions , for which the largest relaxation time of the polymer dominates the dynamics of the molecule , but are inaccurate for molecules under unsteady flow conditions in which molecules can explore faster relaxation modes @xcite . although simulations predict a more realistic restoring force , they are unable to describe its evolution in terms of a simple mathematical formulation for arbitrary flows , legitimizing the search for a simple description which captures short time scale physics .    in this paper , a theoretical framework originally proposed in ref .",

    "a coarse - grained description of the system dynamics is given in terms of a fokker - planck equation for the probability density depending on the parameters accounting for the motion of the polymer center of mass , and a single vector parameter ( called the distortion vector ) accounting for its elastic deformation .",
