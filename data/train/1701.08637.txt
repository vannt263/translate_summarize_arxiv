    "spectra of the 22.2  ghz h@xmath23o and 6.7  ghz ch@xmath28oh maser transitions were recorded in dual circular polarization with resolutions of 7.81 khz ( 0.11  km  s@xmath4 ) and 0.98 khz ( 0.044  km  s@xmath4 ) , respectively , and typical rms sensitivities of 2  jy and 1  jy .",

    "when we convolve the alma image to the resolution of the sma image , the result ( fig .  [ fivepanel]c ) shows a significant difference in the morphology and the total flux density of mm1 ( 10.8@xmath00.9 vs. 2.34@xmath00.22 jy ) between the two epochs .",
    "interestingly , the other sources in the protocluster ( mm2 , mm3 , and mm4 ) do not show significant differences . as described in ",
    "[ obstext ] , residual line emission contaminating the channels chosen to make the alma continuum image can not be the cause of such a large difference in flux density .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of the mm2 hot core is similarly line - rich @xcite so a line contamination effect should manifest in that source as well .    to exclude @xmath31-sampling effects as the culprit",

    "this technique corrects for the distinct differences in @xmath33 among the dust sources ( average values : mm1=2.9 , mm2=3.2 , mm4=2.4 ) , which would otherwise cause a systematic error up to 6% . the resulting image ( fig .",
    "[ fivepanel]d ) demonstrates what the sma would have seen had it observed the region simultaneously with the 2015 alma observations .",
    "we find that the sma could have recovered @xmath34 ( 9.4  jy ) of the mm1 emission recovered by alma , meaning that the bulk of the difference between the 2008 and 2015 images can not be due to @xmath31-sampling .",
    "furthermore , fig  [ fivepanel]e , which shows the difference between the simulated 2015 sma image and the actual 2008 sma image , demonstrates that mm1 exhibits an excess of @xmath35  jy , while mm2 - 4 are consistent with being unchanged ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we conclude that mm1 has flared by a factor of 3.9@xmath00.6 at 1.3  mm during the seven - year interval between the observations , where the uncertainty includes the combined uncertainties in the flux scales and image measurements .",
    "this dramatic increase in flux density explains the anomalously steep 1.5  cm to 1.3  mm spectral energy distributions reported by @xcite for several of the subcomponents of mm1 , and further indicates that the millimeter flaring happened after the 2011 may vla observations .",
    "the 2016 0.87  mm alma image of ngc  6334i is shown in figure  [ fivepanel2]a .",

    "performing the same analysis on our 2016 alma and 2008 sma data at 0.87  mm ( fig .",

    "* ) , mm1 has never been detected in this line , nor in the 12.2  ghz class ii maser line , in three decades of interferometric observations @xcite . because this maser requires far - infrared continuum to pump the torsionally excited states @xcite ,",

[ masers ] ]      to estimate the increase in luminosity implied by the continuum flaring of mm1 , we first measure the increase in 0.87  mm brightness temperature ( @xmath44 ) averaged over the region of brightening shown in fig .",

    "has increased by a factor of 2.9@xmath00.3 ( from 33 to 96  k ) . given the uncertain geometry",
    ", we consider this change in the context of a simple model of a central protostar surrounded by a thick spherical shell of dust .",
    "since our image resolves this structure , the dust temperature ( @xmath47 ) will equal @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the optical depth at 0.87  mm .",
    "the two temperatures should vary proportionally regardless of @xmath49 since the column density and emissivity of the grains ( and hence @xmath49 ) can not have changed substantially in such a short period , except in the hot innermost regions where grains are destroyed ( see   [ disc ] ) .",
    "thus , we can infer a similar increase factor of 2.9 for @xmath47 at the effective emitting surface .",
    "radiative transfer models of dust envelopes surrounding outbursting protostars indicate that @xmath47 scales as the 1/4 power of the central luminosity @xcite ; thus , we compute a luminosity increase factor of @xmath50 . we can estimate a lower limit to the outburst luminosity as the sum of the brightness temperature luminosity estimates for the five mm1 components affected ( a , b , c , d , and g ) reported by @xcite , which is @xmath51  @xmath19 . applying @xmath52 ,",
    "the pre - outburst luminosity is then @xmath53  @xmath19 . assuming the outburst began simultaneously with the maser burst , its duration is @xmath54  years , so the total energy released ( so far ) is @xmath55  erg .",
    "while unprecedented for a massive star forming core , a rapid quadrupling of the ( sub)millimeter continuum flux density from a deeply embedded protostellar system like mm1 is within the realm of theoretical expectation due to episodic accretion , a phenomenon that is increasingly recognized as being essential to star formation @xcite .",
    "although dramatic , the @xmath5670 luminosity increase estimated for mm1 is only about double that of the first identified outbursting class  0 low - mass protostar hops  383 in orion ( @xmath5630 - 50 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose submillimeter flux density increased by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "based on continuum imaging alone , the mm1 increase occurred sometime during the 4.3  year interval between the vla observations and the alma 1.3  mm observations .",
    "since the initiation of the maser flare lies within this window , it likely further constrains the rise time . if the maser and continuum flares began simultaneously , then the rise time was less than a few months , compared to the @xmath2218  month constraint for hops  383 from its mid - infrared measurements .    @xcite simulate the effect of accretion outbursts on the envelope surrounding a low - mass protostar . a @xmath56100 increase in luminosity yields approximately a @xmath565 increase in the 0.87  mm flux density after 208  days , which is somewhat faster and larger than the factor of 4.2 seen in mm1 at 445  days after the maser flare .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to longer timescales in a higher mass system where the dust will be heated to much higher temperatures in the inner optically thick zone .",
    "indeed , the dust in the innermost region will be evaporated as the radius of the dust sublimation temperature ( @xmath171500  k ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) moves outward , thereby enriching the gas phase @xcite .",
    "the timescale to transfer heat from the surviving dust to the gas will be longer than the initial dust heating time @xcite .",
    "modeling the rich , severely blended line emission from complex organic species in order to measure the ongoing changes in gas temperature and chemical abundance compared to the pre - burst state will be a challenging but important avenue of study .",
    "the primary mechanism that could account for such a large outburst is a rapid increase in the accretion rate due either to disk fragmentation @xcite or an encounter @xcite .",
    "a more extreme possibility is a protostellar merger , though for massive protostars this phenomenon would typically produce a much larger energy release than observed @xcite . in the theory of competitive accretion @xcite , multiple seeds accrete gas simultaneously with higher rates occurring at the center of the protocluster .",
    "simulations of such clustered environments find that encounter - induced boosting of the disk accretion rate is possible @xcite , including up to @xmath58 @xcite . while there are several massive protostars with candidate disks ( see the list in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the first evidence for a disk - mediated accretion burst from a high - mass young stellar object was recently reported using infrared observations toward s255ir  nirs3 @xcite .",
    "it is similarly massive but less deeply embedded than mm1 , enabling better constrained luminosity measurements . while its luminosity increase factor ( @xmath565.5 ) is lower than mm1 , its initial luminosity ( @xmath59  @xmath19 ) is significantly larger .",
    "nevertheless , the two events are quantitatively similar in terms of the rapid onset , sustained duration ( @xmath60  yr ) , and total energy , which points toward a common origin .",
    "both objects appear to drive bipolar outflows , which nominally require central disks .",
    "intriguingly , the position angle of the elongated mm1 excess emission is exactly perpendicular to the large - scale bipolar outflow ( + 50 , * ? ? ? * ) and the quasi - symmetry of the excess with respect to mm1b suggests a nearly edge - on , thick disk - like structure .",
    "thus , mm1a , c , d , and g may trace clumps in a fragmented disk heated by an accretion event onto mm1b , which would explain their co - brightening .",
    "however , in this scenario , whether any of these components also contain central protostars is uncertain from the present data , since their high @xmath44 could be consistent with external heating by a @xmath61  @xmath19 central source after accounting for a modest beaming factor ( @xmath622 ) from the `` flashlight effect '' @xcite , an anisotropic radiation field favoring the poles that develops in simulations of massive accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large , sustained increase in luminosity is analogous to fu ori outbursts @xcite , whose decay periods range from 10 to several 100  years @xcite , during which time an elevated quasi - steady accretion rate can persist ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also consistent with hops  383 , which shows no fading after 6  years @xcite . in recent numerical hydrodynamic simulations of massive protostellar accretion",
    "including gas self - gravity and radiative feedback @xcite , the central protostar undergoes a burst in accretion rate from 10@xmath63 to 10@xmath4  @xmath64  yr@xmath4 as a massive ( 0.55  @xmath64 ) gas fragment approaches and enters the protostellar sink cell . spaced by @xmath172000  years , these largest events generate luminosity bursts of @xmath5650 - 100 lasting for several years , two characteristics analogous to the mm1 event . to test this scenario",
    ", it will be crucial to monitor the evolution of mm1 in future years in both dust and free - free emission , as well as to discern if there has been any change to the outflow properties due to the outburst . toward this end",
