    "the string theoretic description of gauge theories is an old idea @xcite , still stimulating research works in theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "depending on the amount of momentum transfer , the hadron - hadron scattering processes have shown two different behaviors @xcite . at very large",
    "momentum transfers the interactions are among the point - like substructures , and qualitative similarities to electron - hadron scattering emerge . at high energies and small momentum transfers",
    "the regge trajectories are exchanged .",
    "the exchanged linear trajectories are the first motivation for the string picture of strong interaction .",
    "however , the fairly good fitting between the linear regge trajectories and the mass of qcd bound - states has not been explained yet @xcite , partially due to the lack of a consistent formulation of string theory in 3 + 1 dimensions    according to string theory , 0-branes are point - like objects to which the strings can end @xcite .",
    "it is known that in a specific regime the dynamics of @xmath0 0-branes is governed by the matrix quantum mechanics resulting from dimensional reduction of u@xmath1 yang - mills theory to @xmath2 dimension @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamics of 0-branes and the strings stretched between them is encoded in the elements of matrix coordinates resulted from the dimensional reduction of non - ableian gauge theory .    by the picture",
    "mentioned above , it sounds reasonable that the dynamics of 0-branes is used to model the bound - states of quarks and qcd - strings .",
    "this picture is the main theme of a series of works , and it is shown that the dynamics of 0-branes can reproduce some known features and expectations in hadron physics , including the potentials between static and fast decaying quarks , and also the regge behavior in the scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the symmetry aspects of the picture were studied in @xcite . in particular , it is argued that maybe the full featured formulation of non - ableian gauge theories is possible on non - commutative matrix spaces @xcite .    in the present note",
    "the aim is to see whether the 0-brane matrix dynamics can reproduce the linear regge trajectories observed in hadron physics .",
    "early studies on spectrum of 0-brane bound - states are reported in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the study of spectrum based on the variational method is presented . in the present work , based on the results by @xcite , for the case of two bosonic 0-branes in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "the energy eigenvalues are calculated for states with given angular momentum , ranging from 0 to 42 .",
    "the spectrum is calculated by the rayleigh - ritz variational method , and the basis function for each angular momentum consists of 80 eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator problem on the configuration space of the 0-branes .",
    "it is seen that apart from two lowest angular momenta , the energy versus angular momentum can be fitted with straight - line at each level .",
    "the spectrum may be interpreted as the one for massive 0-branes in 2 + 1 dimensions , or in a matrix theory perspective @xcite , as for massless particles in 3 + 1 dimensions but in the light - cone frame .",
    "based on the latter way of interpretation , the linear relation can be turned as the one between mass - squared and angular momentum , just reminiscent the observed one in qcd bound - states .",
    "based on the above observation about the spectrum , this may be suggested that , the quantum mechanics of matrix coordinates can reconcile string picture and qcd in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "in particular , according to this picture the bound - states of quarks and qcd - strings are governed by the quantum mechanics of matrix coordinates @xcite .",
    "the scheme of the rest of this paper is the following . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the basic notions for the 0-brane matrix dynamics are presented , together with a demonstration of a bound - state classical solution . in sec .  3 , the quantum theory is developed .",
    "the eigen - functions of the angular momentum together with the complete solution for harmonic oscillator on the 0-branes configuration space are presented .",
    "this solution is used to construct the basis function used in the rayleigh - ritz variational method of sec .",
    "the light - cone interpretation of the results is also presented in sec .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 0-branes is given by a u@xmath1 yang - mills theory dimensionally reduced to @xmath2 dimensions @xcite , given by ( in units @xmath3 ) [ 1 ] &  & l = m_0 ( ( d_tx_i)^2 + [ x_i , x_j]^2 ) , + &  & i , j=1, ... ,d , d_t=_t-[a_0,],with @xmath4 as the fundamental string length , and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 as the supposedly small string coupling ,",

    "the theory is invariant under the gauge symmetry [ 2 ] & & = uu^ , + a_0&&a_0=ua_0u^+ u_tu^ , where @xmath11 is an arbitrary time - dependent @xmath12 unitary matrix . under these transformations",
    "one can check that : [ 3 ] d_t&&d_t = u(d_t)u^ , + d_td_t&&d_td_t = u(d_td_t)u^. for each direction there are @xmath13 variables and it is understood that the extra @xmath14 degrees of freedom are representing the dynamics of oriented strings stretched between @xmath0 0-branes .",
    "the center - of - mass of 0-branes is represented by the trace of the @xmath8 matrices .    in the quantum theory the off - diagonal elements of matrices play an essential role . in particular , it is shown that in the quantum theory the off - diagonal elements cause the interaction between 0-branes . for the case of classically static 0-branes",
    "it is shown that the fluctuations of the off - diagonal elements develop a linear potential , just as the case for qcd - strings stretched between quarks @xcite .",
    "the canonical momenta are given by : [ 4 ] p_i==m_0d_t x_i by which the hamiltonian is constructed [ 5 ] h=(- [ x_i , x_j]^2 ) . as",

    "we take the two dimensional case ( @xmath16 ) for a pair of 0-branes",
    ". it would be quite useful to separate the pure gauge variables from the others .",
    "for the case of su(2 ) theory in 2 + 1 dimensions , following @xcite we use the decomposition @xmath17 in which the matrix @xmath18 is an element of group of su(2 ) . accordingly",
    "the gauge transformations of the variable @xmath19 are captured by @xmath18 through ordinary gauge group left multiplications . parameterizing the su(2 ) group elements by the three euler angles ,",
    "the matrix @xmath18 is represented by @xcite @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is the rotation matrix about the @xmath22th axis .",
    "analogously , the matrix @xmath23 is an element of the so(2 ) group parameterized by the angle @xmath24 , capturing the effect of rotation in the two dimensional space .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 takes the form @xcite @xmath26 we mention that the only variable with dimension of length is @xmath27 .",
    "also , apart from pure gauge variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the two dimensional configuration space is spanned by the polar coordinates @xmath31 , and the extra variable @xmath32 appears as an internal degree of freedom .    by the decomposition ,",
    "the three constraints ( [ 6 ] ) take the form @xcite : @xmath33 in which @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the conjugate momenta of the pure gauge variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . by the constraints ( [ 6 ] ) , using the explicit forms ( [ 10 ] ) , we have to set : @xmath37 by imposing the constraints , setting @xmath38 the hamiltonian takes the form @xcite @xmath39 in which @xmath40 , as the reduced mass appearing in the relative motion of two 0-branes .",
    "it is easy to check that the canonical momentum of @xmath24 , @xmath41 , is conserved . so as expected , the two dimensional angular momentum is a constant of motion .",
    "the equations of motion by ( [ 12 ] ) are @xmath42 it is easy to check that @xmath43 , by which the potential is set to zero , the equations for @xmath31 would come to the form of a free particle in polar coordinate . as an illustration that the above equations can develop bound - states , the plots of a numerical solution are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "in the figure , the outer curve is @xmath44 as the path of the relative motion of 0-branes in the polar coordinate setup @xmath31 , while the inner curve is a ten times scaled of @xmath45 , as the internal degree of freedom causing the effective attractive force between 0-branes .",
    "evidently , this solution represents an almost circular path for the relative motion of 0-branes .    ) .",
    "the outer curve is representing the radial coordinate as a function of the polar angle @xmath24 .",
    "the inner one , which is scaled ten times to make it visible , is @xmath45 .",
    "the solution is by the conditions : @xmath46 , @xmath38 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49rad , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ]",
    "in passing to quantum theory , the constraints in operator form define the physically acceptable states as [ 14 ] |=0 by the replacements @xmath52 one would find , as expected , that the physical wave - functions do not depend on the pure gauge degrees of freedom @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . the laplacian operator can be constructed using the metric @xmath53 @xmath54 in which @xmath55 , explicitly found to be @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "so , in the coordinate setup @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the hamiltonian acting on the wave - function @xmath60 , takes the form @xcite @xmath61 in which @xmath62 using the scaling @xmath63 , the hamiltonian comes to the form @xmath64 by the introduced separation of variables , the two dimensional angular momentum is @xmath65 @xcite , and obviously commutes with the hamiltonian , @xmath66=0 $ ] .",
    "so one can construct states with given energy and angular momentum .      here",
    "the aim is to find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the operator @xmath67 @xmath68 for which we assume as usual @xmath69 with @xmath70 as the quantum number associated to the angular momentum in the two dimensional configuration space .",
    "although the pure gauge degrees of freedom have been separated out , it is known that a remaining discrete gauge transformation would cause that only even integer values are accepted for @xmath70 @xcite . in particular , the shifts @xmath71 and @xmath72 would make equal changes to the original variables , namely @xmath73 , if @xmath70 has an odd value .",
    "so , to construct absolute gauge invariant physical states , the quantum number @xmath70 has to be even , setting @xmath74 using the change of variable @xmath75 , one has @xmath76 as the spectrum is invariant under the change @xmath77 , from now on we take @xmath78 . using the replacement @xmath79 , @xmath80 which is known to have jacobi polynomials of order @xmath81 , @xmath82 , as solutions @xcite . by this",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath83 is found @xmath84 for the normalized eigenfunction @xmath85 the jacobi polynomials of our interest satisfy the following recurrence relation , which comes mostly helpful when the matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ 19 ] ) are evaluated in the angular momentum basis : @xmath86      as we are going to evaluate the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ 19 ] ) by the variational rayleigh - ritz method @xcite , a set of basis functions is needed , for which we shall take those of harmonic oscillator . for a harmonic oscillator with kinetic term as in ( [ 19 ] ) and unit frequency ( @xmath87 ) , taking @xmath88 the radial equation would come to the form @xmath89 in which @xmath90 it is known that the above has normalized solutions in terms of the laguerre polynomials @xmath91 with ( @xmath92 ) : @xmath93 to calculate the matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ 19 ] ) , the following recurrence relations for laguerre polynomia1ls would appear mostly useful @xcite : @xmath94 the following identity for the integral of laguerre polynomials is known as well @xcite @xmath95 of course if @xmath96 the integral is zero .",
    "to find the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ 19 ] ) we use the rayleigh - ritz variational method , in which a basis function is needed to approximate the exact eigenfunctions .",
    "here we take the basis function to be a collection of eigenstates of harmonic oscillator obtained in previous part . as we are interested to find eigenvalues with given angular momentum @xmath70 , the basis function",
    "is taken ( recall @xmath97 ) @xmath98 in which @xmath99 and @xmath100 determine the level of truncations . by this choice",
    ", the number of the members of the basis function is equal to @xmath101 .    before to proceed",

    "apart from two lowest @xmath70 s , the values given in tab .  1 together with the straight - line data fittings are plotted in fig .  2 .",

    "the obtained spectrum may be interpreted as the one for massive 0-branes in 2 + 1 dimensions , or in a matrix theory perspective @xcite , as for massless particles in 3 + 1 dimensions but in the light - cone frame . for the latter way of interpretation , the relative motion of bound - state constituents ( defined by @xmath111 )",
