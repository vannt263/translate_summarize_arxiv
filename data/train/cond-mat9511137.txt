    "apart from being of fundamental interest , the characterization of the low - index diamond surface is very important from a technological point of view .",
    "the fast development of chemical vapor deposition techniques has increased the demand for a better understanding of the ground state and excited properties of these surfaces.@xcite indeed , much experimental and theoretical attention has been paid to the characterization of the geometrical structure , vibrational modes and electronic properties of these surfaces , with interesting and sometimes controversial results . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in characterizing the _ optical _ response of the ( 111 ) diamond surface , and investigating how these properties are related to the structural reconstruction and its accompanying electronic structure .",
    "our interest on this particular surface includes concerns on discrepancies between the present experimental @xcite and theoretical results.@xcite experimentally , a great deal of the surface electronic structure is well known through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes),@xcite soft - x - rays absorption,@xcite inverse photoemission,@xcite and electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels).@xcite the photon - induced measurements show a variety of occupied @xcite and unoccupied @xcite surface states lying in the fundamental gap .",
    "however , the complete description of these surface states has been difficult , since only their dispersion along a few of the main directions of the surface unit cell have been measured . on the other hand , eels measurements @xcite",
    "show a prominent broad feature at about 2.1  ev , which is attributed to transitions from occupied to unoccupied surface states .",
    "since eels experiments measure a transition energy which is generally smaller than the difference between occupied and unoccupied states , and a relatively large uncertainty ( @xmath1  ev ) accompanied this particular eels experiment , a direct comparison with other results has not been possible .",
    "several theoretical studies have been done to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of the c(111)-2@xmath01 surface .",
    "both , _ ab initio _ @xcite and semi - empirical @xcite theoretical approaches have been employed , yielding some differences among them and with experimental results .",
    "some of these differences arise from the methodology employed .",
    "for example , iarlori and co - workers @xcite employed a lda formalism using a plane wave basis , while vanderbilt and louie,@xcite and alfonso and co - workers @xcite used the lda formalism based on a set of localized orbitals . in the former work the energy gaps are underestimated,@xcite as is common in this kind of approximation , and a direct comparison to experimental results is difficult .",
    "the latter theoretical works compare well among them,@xcite although a systematic shift of about 1  ev is found when the surface states are compared with those measured experimentally.@xcite on the other hand , the semi - empirical tight - binding approach of davidson and pickett @xcite compares well with the _ ab initio _",
    "results described above , except for an extra shift of the surface states by about 0.8  ev . since the surface states determine the location of the fermi level , there is a large discrepancy among different theoretical works as to the relative position of the fermi level and the top of the valence band that goes from 1.3 to 2  ev . on the other hand , in all theoretical and experimental results",
    "there is general good agreement on the energy gap between empty and full surface states . from these considerations",
    ", one can then conclude that the calculated electronic structures alone are not able to uniquely determine the nature of the transitions observed in eels,@xcite resulting in controversial interpretations of the available experimental optical data.@xcite the evaluation of the surface dielectric response function for this system , and its analysis in terms of the associated electronic level structure gives further insights into this problem , as we discuss below .    in the present work , and in close connection with the general description of the optical properties of the c(111)-2@xmath01 surface , we investigate in detail the origin of the electronic transitions related to the surface reconstruction .",
    "our calculations employ a semi - empirical tight - binding approach that has been used previously to study the optical properties of si(111 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 100),@xcite and c(001 ) @xcite surfaces .",
    "our tight - binding formalism is similar to the one used by davidson and pickett,@xcite except that our extended orbital basis allows perhaps a better description of the conduction band due to its additional s@xmath2 orbital , and our level structure is in general better agreement with experimental findings and other calculations .",
    "since we calculate the _ surface _ dielectric tensor , the results presented here can be compared directly with those measured using various optical spectroscopies . in particular , the differential reflectance and reflectance anisotropy spectroscopies provide accurate information about surface properties of metals @xcite and semiconductors.@xcite this is very important since several semiconductor surfaces show a metallic - like behavior due to the narrow gap between occupied and unoccupied surface states that hamper the use of electronic spectroscopies like arpes , eels and scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "this indeed seems to be the case for the c(111)-2@xmath01 surface , where a narrow gap has been found theoretically along one of the main directions on the surface,@xcite while no direct experimental evidence is found in the literature for this metallic behavior .",
    "this behavior is in comparison with the si and ge ( 111)-2@xmath01 reconstructed surfaces,@xcite where the degeneracy of the surface states is broken by the buckling of the surface atoms , as the theoretical and experimental description of the surface states shows .",
    "notice , furthermore , that the optical spectroscopies mentioned above have the advantage over other techniques of allowing _ in situ _ real - time measurements , which provide the invaluable opportunity of monitoring the chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxial growth,@xcite as well as the dynamics of the chemisorption process.@xcite the results presented here then not only provide answers to fundamental questions , but give important information for applications , which we expect will motivate future work in this direction .    in section",
    "ii , we present a brief discussion of the structural model of the surface and the methods used to calculate its electronic and optical properties . in section iii , we discuss our results and compare with the available data in the literature .",
    "the results for the optical properties are presented in terms of the dielectric response of the surface , and the calculated reflectance anisotropy and eels spectra .",
    "the diamond ( 111)-2@xmath01 surface was modeled using a slab of 28 c layers with inversion symmetry , yielding a free reconstructed surface on each face of the slab . the thickness of the slab is large enough to decouple the surface states at the top and bottom surfaces of the slab . in fig .",

    "this approximation has been applied to calculate the optical properties of a variety of silicon surfaces , @xcite and recently to the ( 001 ) surface of diamond , @xcite yielding good results .",

    "this change is assumed to be the likely result of additional orbital confinement at the surface , and as we will see below , it yields a level structure more attuned to experiments and other theoretical calculations .",
    "moreover , the scaling factor of all tight - binding parameters for this particular surface was taken as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the bondlenght of any two first - neighbors atoms and @xmath9  , is the bondlenght in bulk diamond .",
    "these changes to the original bulk parameters provide an excellent description of the electronic structure , as compared to experimental measurements , @xcite as we will show on section iii .",

    "the `` three - layer model '' of drude @xcite and mcintyre and aspnes @xcite adopted here is widely used in the analysis of optical data , and assumes that the system consists of three homogeneous regions : bulk , surface and vacuum , and the dielectric response is treated accordingly .",

    "then , only two additional parameters to those of the tight - binding hamiltonian were needed in order to reproduce the bulk dielectric function .",
    "these parameters are the so - called intra - atomic sp and s@xmath2p dipoles , with best fitted values of 0.18    and 0.7   , respectively .",
    "notice that these calculations neglect in principle excitonic @xcite and local field effects,@xcite although the fitting parameter procedure compensates to some extent and yields very good agreement with bulk optical measurements . for a detailed description of the method the reader",
    "is referred to the pioneering work of selloni _",
    "et al_.@xcite and the review by del sole.@xcite    in the above discussion , we have seen that the atomic structure of the surface region is intimately related to the dielectric response through its electronic structure , as given by eq .",

    "experimentally , it is known that the surface dielectric function can be extracted by means of electronic and optical spectroscopies .",
    "measurements of the reflectance anisotropy ( ra ) is one of these optical techniques which consists of measuring the relative reflectance difference of two orthogonal light polarizations on the surface plane , @xmath3 and @xmath24 for example .",
    "although the sample penetration of light is in general a few hundred times larger than the depth of the surface layer , the contribution from the bulk region to the ra spectra is canceled since the bulk optical properties of cubic materials are isotropic .",
    "correspondingly , this technique is extremely sensitive to surface features and electronic properties due to reconstructions or adsorption events .",
    "theoretically , the reflectivity is related to the dielectric function through the fresnel formula,@xcite which must however ,",

    "the second experimental technique in which we are interested is the electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) . here",
    ", an electron beam of a given low - energy and momentum is scattered by the sample .",
    "the electron beam induces polarizations on the surface region so that the electrons lose some of this energy before being scattered into the detector . the process can be described well in terms of a dipolar scattering theory,@xcite and provides a suitable description of vibrational modes of surface atoms and molecules , as well as electron transitions on the surface region . in the present work ,",
    "all of the electronic transitions in the surface region are due to the reconstruction of the surface and not to adsorbates , although the work could be generalized to include various adsorbate species as well .",
    "the electron scattering probability @xmath29 for an electron that loses a quantum of energy @xmath30 , and transfers a momentum @xmath31 in the direction of the surface plane is given by @xcite @xmath32 where * k and * k**@xmath33 are the wave - vectors of the incident and scattered electrons , @xmath34 is the angle of incidence and @xmath35 is the momentum transfer in the direction perpendicular to the surface plane .",
    "the above relation holds when the energy loss and momentum transfer to the medium are small . assuming that the scattering occurs in the @xmath36 plane , the loss function",
    "is defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the nonlocal effective dielectric function of the system . in the limit @xmath39 ,",

    "the states associated to the surface reconstruction are represented by stars , while dots correspond to the projected bulk states .",
    "the top of the bulk valence band is set at 0  ev , and the calculated fermi level ( @xmath42 ) is at about 1.5  ev ( not indicated in fig .",

    "this result is in excellent agreement with the reported experimental value of 1.5@xmath430.2  ev.@xcite in fact , the calculated results presented here are in excellent general agreement with experimental measurements @xcite and also compare well with those calculated previously using first - principles @xcite and parameterized tight - binding @xcite approaches .",
    "the calculated surface band structure of fig .  [ sbs ] shows a large gap of about 5.5  ev between the occupied and unoccupied surface states at the @xmath41 point .",
    "the occupied surface states liying within the bulk valence band show a dispersion of @xmath44 2.4  ev along the @xmath41j direction ( the pandey chain axis direction ) , and have mainly a p@xmath5 character .",
    "the behavior of these states is similar to one observed experimentally by himpsel and co - workers @xcite and pate and co - workers @xcite , where a nearly flat filled surface band is found from @xmath41 to about 0.5@xmath41j where there is a minimum , and then rapidly disperses upward while approaching the j point .",
    "a similar behavior is found for these surface states along the @xmath41k direction . above the fermi level",
    "there are two bands of unoccupied states near 4.5 and 5.5  ev at the @xmath41 point .",
    "these states have a strong s and p@xmath5 component corresponding to the dangling bonds of the surface chain atoms and the backbonds with the second and third layer atoms .",
    "the states at 4.5  ev show a nearly flat band in the first half of the @xmath41j and @xmath41k directions , at about the halfway point in both directions the band has a maximum and then rapidly disperses downward approaching the j and k points . in the direction perpendicular to the chain , jk , these empty surface states and the occupied surface band become nearly degenerate and show little dispersion of less than 0.1  ev .",
    "notice that these two states cross the fermi level halfway through the jk direction .",
    "the striking difference in dispersion of the surface bands along the two main directions is a reflection of the pandey - like chains formed on the surface .",
    "the chains along the @xmath41j ( or @xmath3 ) direction allow for nearly free - like electronic motion ( although the dispersion is not parabolic ) , while the nearly vanishing overlap between the chains along jk ( or @xmath24 ) direction yields nearly flat surface bands and reduces electronic hopping across zigzag chains .",
    "near @xmath445.5  ev at the @xmath41 point begins a band of unoccupied surface states mainly due to the surface dangling - bonds , and part to second layer backbonds , corresponding approximately to those calculated by vanderbilt and louie @xcite and alfonso and co - workers , @xcite and likely to be those observed by kubiak and kolasinski.@xcite these states show a dispersion of about 1  ev with a minimum at about halfway the @xmath41j direction , where they anticross the surface band associated to the backbond states described above , and produce a hardly noticeable splitting at the crossing . on the other hand ,",
    "these states show less dispersion ( @xmath440.5  ev ) along the @xmath41k direction and never cross the empty surface dangling bonds band .",
    "these states have also been observed experimentally by kubiak and kolasinski @xcite with a weak intensity at an energy of about 5.8  ev from the top of the valence band , for both the @xmath41j and @xmath41k directions .",
    "finally , some localized resonance - like occupied states are also found at @xmath45  ev and at @xmath46  ev near the @xmath41 point ( shown as stars within the valence band in fig .",
    "[ sbs ] ) .",
    "the former states are mainly due to the subsurface chains with a strong p@xmath47 component , and the latter one have first- and second - layer backbond characteristics .",
    "the states at @xmath45  ev are similar to those reported by vanderbilt and louie.@xcite    experimental photoemission results show occupied @xcite and unoccupied @xcite surface states with a gap of nearly 5.1  ev at the @xmath41 point .",
    "the fermi level is reported at about 1.5  ev above the top of the valence band , similar to our findings , while the dispersion of the observed surface states is in very good agreement with those calculated here , and those reported by vanderbilt and louie.@xcite moreover , since these surface states are detectable only for p - polarization , they show a strong s and p@xmath5 character , in agreement with our results .",
    "a resonance unoccupied state has also been observed at about 6  ev from the top of the valence band at the @xmath41 point.@xcite this resonance state is much weaker than the surface states lying in the fundamental gap , and it has not been possible to fully investigate its orbital character , although it could be the higher - energy surface state we find .    while the calculated surface bands in fig .",
    "[ sbs ] compare well with the experimental results,@xcite the calculated lda @xcite and tight - binding @xcite results are rigidly shifted by + 1 and + 2 ev , respectively .",
    "the discrepancies among the different approaches could perhaps be partly attributed to many - body effects .",
    "for example , when the exchange correlation effects are considered , the surface band is shifted towards the top of the projected bulk valence band.@xcite moreover , when dynamical effects are taken into account within the gw approximation , the surface band moves into the projected bulk valence band in the vicinity of the @xmath41 point,@xcite also in agreement with experimental results.@xcite however , there could be other sources of error when we compare directly with experimental results , including the precise experimental location of the fermi level , as pointed out before.@xcite    the total electronic density of states ( dos ) of the slab , and the projected density of states of the first two layers are shown in fig .  [ dos ] .",
    "the dos was calculated taking an average over 4900 points distributed homogeneously in the irreducible sbz .",
    "we observe within the fundamental bulk gap , between 0 and 5.5  ev , a non - zero density of states coming mainly from the dangling bonds associated with first layer atoms .",
    "this continuum of surface states is responsible for the metallic - like behavior of the surface around the fermi level , as we will discuss in detail in the next section .",
    "notice that the dos from 0 to 4  ev is nearly a constant , as expected for a 2d free - electron system . from fig .",
    "[ dos ] is clear that the peak at about 4.5  ev with a strong p@xmath5 component has its origin in the dangling bond and the first- and second - layer backbonds",
    ". the resonance states at about @xmath45 and @xmath48  ev are associated with the second layer chains and the backbonds between the first layer and second layer atoms , respectively .",
    "the pronounced peaks of the projected dos in the first layer , at about @xmath49 and 4.5  ev are due to the lack of dispersion of the surface bands on the first half of the @xmath41j and @xmath41k directions of the sbz ( see fig .  [ sbs ] ) . here , we observe that the states in the bulk gap are mainly localized in the first two layers , as one would expect , with decreasing intensity into the slab .    finally , before addressing the optical consequences of this level structure",
    ", we should comment on our choice of parameters .",
    "the excellent agreement with experiments and _ ab initio _ electronic calculations has been greatly enhanced by our use of the different e@xmath50 parameter at the surface atoms , as mentioned above , as well as to the fully - relaxed atomic positions for the reconstructed surface of ref .",
    "[ alfonso ] . indeed , use of the _ bulk _ e@xmath50 parameters for all surface atoms yields a level structure ( not shown ) very similar to that of davidson and pickett.@xcite in that case , we obtain @xmath51 ev above the valence - band top , while the filled surface dangling bond state remains @xmath52 ev below @xmath42 ( but now _ above _ the valence band ) .",
    "similarly , the gap between surface state and conduction band bottom along the jk direction is only @xmath53 ev , rather than the 4 ev gap shown in fig .",
    "this full set of results validates the choice of the physical parameter e@xmath50 at the surface .",
    "although a detailed fit to the experimental results was not performed , it is clear ( as one would expect on general physical grounds ) that the orbital localization at the surface affects the diagonal tight - binding parameters .",
    "a full _ ab initio _ determination of the various optical parameters , both in the bulk and near the surface , together with the fully relaxed level structure will be obviously desirable .",
    "we are currently carrying out such project and our results will be presented elsewhere .      the imaginary part of the average polarizability of the slab , eq .",
    "( [ alfa ] ) , was calculated using 4900 points distributed homogeneously on the irreducible sbz .",
    "the large number of points needed is due to the small ( large ) size of the surface unit cell in real ( reciprocal ) space and to the large sections of the sbz with flat joint density of states .",
    "the average over this large number of points is necessary to give full and reliable convergence of the optical properties for this particular surface .",
    "electron transitions up to 20  ev were taken into account , so that after the kramers - kronig transform the calculated real part is accurate up to about 10  ev .    in fig .",
    "[ die ] , we present the real and imaginary parts of the surface dielectric tensor @xmath54 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) .",
    "the thickness of the surface region used was @xmath55  , which approximately corresponds to two monolayers ( other choices of @xmath56 do not change qualitatively our results for energies in the bulk gap ) .",
    "the response for light polarized along the chains ( @xmath3 axis , @xmath57 ) corresponds to the solid lines , while for light polarized in the @xmath24 direction ( @xmath58 ) is shown by dotted lines , and the dashed lines correspond to the direction perpendicular to the surface plane ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath54 along @xmath3 shows a strong peak at about 0.1  ev that is 100 times more intense than the rest of the structure shown in fig .",
    "this peak at low - energy is a reflection of the metallic - like character of the surface along the chains .",
    "then , from 2 to 5.5  ev the dielectric function is nearly constant up to the point when electron transitions between bulk states become important .",
    "the following discussion about the origin of the main electron transitions of the surface dielectric function can be seen clearly in the lower four panels of fig .",
    "[ ra ] , where the reflectance anisotropy spectrum has been decomposed into the different contributions , _ s - s , s - b , b - b , and _ b - s__. for light polarized in both directions , @xmath3 and @xmath24 , the dielectric response is dominated by transitions among surface states ( _ s - s _ ) up to @xmath44  4  ev . from about 4",

    "it is clear that the spectrum shows a large surface anisotropic optical response in a large range of photon energies .",
    "while for @xmath3-polarized light the spectrum shows mainly one peak at low energies , the @xmath24-polarization spectrum shows a rich structure for all energies inside the bulk optical gap .",

    "then , the intensity enhancement of the _ s - b _ contribution starting from @xmath44  6.5 ev corresponds to an increase of the density of the conduction - band states . in all cases ,",

    "the primary energy of the electron beam was taken equal to 80  ev , with a normal incidence geometry .",
    "the spectrum corresponding to an electron beam polarized along the chain ( solid line ) is very different at low energies ( less than 1  ev ) than the results for a polarization perpendicular to the chains ( dotted line ) .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath3-polarized reflected beam is a few thousand times larger that the beam for @xmath24 direction polarization . at higher energies , from about 4  ev onwards ,",
    "the two spectra show similar amplitude and behavior .",
    "the inset shows the scattering probability for energy loss from 2 to 8  ev , where the intensity has been augmented 500 times . here",
    ", a feature starts at about 4  ev . as we discussed above , these structures are related to the contribution to the surface dielectric response from _ s - b _ and _ b - s _ transitions , while the broad peak at about 6 ev is produced by _ s - s _ transitions . notice that the high energy - loss features are strongly reduced by the decaying prefactor @xmath64 appearing in the definition of @xmath65 , eq .  ( 4 ) .",
    "the eels experiments reported by pepper @xcite showed a broad structure centered near 2.1 ev ( and width of about 1.7 ev ) .",
    "the primary energy of the normal incident electron beam was @xmath66  ev . the main spectrum reported by pepper was obtained by subtracting the spectra measured for the clean and hydrogenated surfaces , in order to reduce the effects of a strong elastic peak and to enhance the signal due to the reconstruction .",
    "the spectra of the clean and hydrogenated surfaces were obtained from an average over the sbz . in the difference spectrum a minimum gap of about 1  ev",
    "was observed and identified with the effective gap between surface states at the point j. the energy resolution of the system is estimated at 0.63  ev , from the width of the elastic peak remnant .",
    "since the energy resolution is not optimal in this experiment , it is difficult to make a direct comparison with theoretical calculations and other experiments .",
    "moreover , the energy loss measured by this kind of spectroscopy is generally smaller than the energy difference between occupied and unoccupied states of the system on its ground state .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the observed broad feature at 2.1 ev is related to the _ s - s _ transitions integrated over the sbz , and expected to have an enhanced joint dos at @xmath67 ev .",
    "the overall resulting feature would perhaps be a combination of excitonic downshift and the high - energy ( @xmath64 ) suppression factor .",
    "it is clear , however , that a better - resolution and more detailed eels study on this system will be highly desirable",
    ". we will be glad to provide details of our electronic structure and surface dielectric function results to interested experimental groups .",
    "we have investigated the optical response of the c(111)-2@xmath01 surface based on a sp@xmath4s@xmath2 parameterized tight - binding approach .",
    "the dielectric function of the surface region was calculated and a large anisotropy was found .",
    "this anisotropy of the optical response is a direct consequence of the surface reconstruction .",
    "the dielectric response of the surface was analyzed in terms of the _ s - s _ , _ s - b _ , _ b - b _ and _ b - s _ transitions , and important features corresponding to each type of transitions were found .",
    "the reflectance anisotropy and electron energy loss spectra were calculated in order to provide direct comparison with experiments .",
    "we can conclude that these optical spectroscopies combined with theoretical studies , can help one elucidate the controversial surface electronic structure , and therefore , the structural and electronic level reconstruction of this important surface .",
    "we are thankful to d. a. drabold , r. del sole , and r. g. barrera for their valuable comments , and to d. r. alfonso for providing the coordinates for the relaxed diamond ( 111)-2@xmath01 surface .",
