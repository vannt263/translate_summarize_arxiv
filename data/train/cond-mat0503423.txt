    "another generic model is the kondo lattice model ( klm ) which describes a noninteracting electron gas coupled to localised spin moments via a heisenberg spin interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the dispersion relation for the electrons on the lattice , @xmath3 being the hopping integrals .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the exchange integral of the local spin interaction , the so called kondo exchange .",
    "we want to consider here the one - dimensional case which has been the subject of numerous numerical and analytical investigations .",

    "the first is a broadening of the band .",
    "the effective band width is enlarged compared with the original band width @xmath132 .",
    "the other one is a decreasing density of states at the fermi momentum @xmath133 and at @xmath134 .",
    "this property is mainly due to the dominant peak structure in the spin correlation function @xmath119 at @xmath135 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath136 connects the two points of the fermi surface .",
    "therefore the energies near the fermi surface become more strongly renormalized than energies near the band edge . the pseudo - gap like",
    "structure at @xmath133 is thus due to the strong spin fluctuations at @xmath135 .",
    "as we are going to see this behaviour shall have consequences for the electronic density of states @xmath137 .",
    "as the luttinger liquid theory expects @xmath137 to vanish at @xmath138 a decreasing density of states in the renormalized electron spectrum is reasonable . in order to resolve the observed structures in the renormalized electron spectrum we need to examine larger systems .",
    "let us now study the static correlation functions calculated in the last section .",
    "the first quantity we want to consider is the momentum distribution function @xmath99 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nk ] .",
    "we obtain meaningful results only for couplings up to @xmath139 .",
    "this signals a breakdown of the flow equation treatment . in order to get better results for larger ratios",
    "@xmath7 we need to go beyond the third order corrections in the flow equations .",
    "looking at @xmath99 we notice that it is smeared out around @xmath140 .",
    "however , we can not decide whether these results support the expected luttinger liquid picture or not .",
    "the special behaviour of @xmath99 at @xmath133 may be due to the dominant peak structure of @xmath119 .",
    "since it is difficult to resolve the sharp peak of @xmath119 appropriately for a finite system , we are not sure whether the artifact at @xmath141 is due to the finite system size or the approximations .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the momentum distribution function tends to support a small fermi surface , because there is no feature at @xmath142 .",
    "additionally , one may question if the effective model ( [ eq : eff_modell ] ) is capable of describing a large fermi surface .",
    "the system of conduction electrons within the effective model has a fermi momentum @xmath143 .",
    "therefore a singularity in the momentum distribution function is likely to be expected only at the point @xmath133 .",
    "we can get further information from the charge correlation function @xmath104 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cq ] .",
    "as we expect for small couplings @xmath7 the function @xmath104 takes the form of a noninteracting one - dimensional electron gas with a kink at @xmath125 . increasing @xmath7 leads to a cusp - like behaviour of @xmath104 at @xmath135 .",
    "in addition , the slope at @xmath122 drops with growing interaction stregth @xmath7 .",
    "the results displayed in fig . [ fig : cq ] agree qualitatively with the findings from numerical treatments @xcite in the examined parameter regime ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "this supports the luttinger liquid picture of our description .",
    "the charge correlation function gives us the possibility to derive the parameter @xmath0 of the luttinger liquid theory .",
    "this parameter is connected to the slope of @xmath104 at @xmath122 via the relation @xcite @xmath145    the outcome is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_r_j ] as a function of the kondo coupling @xmath7 . as we have already mentioned before the slope of @xmath104 at @xmath146 decreases with growing coupling strength ( up to the allowed value of @xmath147 ) . for vanishing interaction strength @xmath148 corresponding to a noninteracting electron gas .",
    "this can be understood from the equation for @xmath104 given in the appendix . due to the flow equation ( [ eq : flussgleichung_gamma ] ) for the parameter @xmath149 of the electron operator transformation all terms vanish which represent corrections to the charge correlation function of independent electrons .",
    "our findings are in qualitative agreement with recent numerical results from dmrg calculations @xcite .",
    "xavier and miranda find a minimum of @xmath150 at @xmath151",
    ". remember that our largest possible coupling is smaller than @xmath152 .",

    "@xcite gives results for large @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to our findings and to those of xavier and miranda @xcite these authors expect @xmath153 in the limit @xmath154 .",

    "another characteristic is the finite weight of the ferromagnetic component @xmath122 which is directly connected with the occurence of the quantum phase transition .",
    "on approaching the critical @xmath7 the maximum of @xmath105 at @xmath136 loses weight in favour of the ferromagnetic component .",
    "this behaviour marks the phase transition @xcite . as we already mentioned the present approach",
    "is restricted to values of @xmath144 .",
    "these values are too small compared to the value at the transition point which is @xmath156 for @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we observe some tendency towards the magnetic phase transition . as in the case of the charge correlation function",
    "we compare our results with numerical data from @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see the qualitative agreement between the two approaches , although our findings tend to be smaller than the dmrg results .",
    "this is important if one considers the points at @xmath122 .",
    "the increase of the ferromagnetic component , which signals the tendency towards the quantum phase transition , turns out to be comparably weak .",
    "the situation we have just described is also characteristic for the spin correlation function @xmath102 of the local moments which is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : sff ] . for small couplings",
    "we see that the corrections to the spin correlation function of the effective model @xmath119 are negligibly small . even for larger values of @xmath7",
    "we find only small corrections .",
    "the vicinity of the ferromagnetic component @xmath122 is shown in the inset . nevertheless , the qualitative behaviour is once again in agreement with numerical results @xcite though the values are somewhat larger .",
    "again , the ferromagnetic component gets an increasing weight while the @xmath136 component is suppressed .      in the last section we have presented the results for static expectation values and correlation functions .",
    "we have found that our results are in qualitative agreement with numerical data for small couplings @xmath7 .",

    "its position is simply given by the renormalized single - particle energies @xmath129 .",
    "the incoherent background contains pairs of elementary excitations of the spin system of @xmath43 .",

    "( [ eq : operator_e ] ) since within the schwinger boson approach for the effective spin system the corrections to the spectral functions @xmath110 are always connected to the creation ( annihilation ) of pairs of bosons .",
    "the coupling to the continuum of schwinger boson excitations and the results for @xmath160 give rise to the two maxima around the quasiparticle - like peak .",
    "the electronic density of states @xmath137 is an important quantity which shows a characteristic behaviour for luttinger liquids .",
    "it is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] .",
    "again , the energy is measured with respect to @xmath158 .",
    "we find two minima , one in the vicinity of the fermi level of the conduction electrons , @xmath138 , the other above the fermi level .",
    "this behaviour follows from the pseudogap - like behaviour of the renormalized single - particle energies @xmath129 .",
    "in contrast to our findings dmrg studies from shibata and tsunetsugu @xcite do not yield a minimum but rather a peak structure just below @xmath138 indicating the development of a pseudo gap .",
    "however , their results were performed at finite temperatures .",
    "the luttinger liquid theory predicts a density of states following latexmath:[$\\rho(\\omega ) \\sim    @xmath138 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] there is no real vanishing of @xmath137 at @xmath138 .",
    "as we are dealing here with a finite system size we are not able to resolve @xmath137 near @xmath138 and to verify the expected behaviour .",
    "let us now turn to the magnetic properties .",
    "we want to present the results for the dynamic spin structure factors of the electrons @xmath162 and the local moments @xmath163 .",
    "they describe the magnetic excitations of the coupled system and can be measured by inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "we begin with the electronic dynamic spin structure factor @xmath162 which consists of a low- and a high - energy part .",
    "both are discussed seperately . the low energy sector , left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sqw_el ] , is characterised by the spin part of the effective model @xmath164 , _ i.e. _ the continuum of pair excitations of the schwinger bosons .",
    "the dominant contribution is therefore found at @xmath136 .",
    "it is multiplied by a factor @xmath165 for a better comparison .",
    "we also see that there are regions where no excitations are possible .",
    "furthermore , the gap in the spectrum of the elementary excitations @xmath112 leads to a gap in the low - energy part of @xmath162 .",
    "the high - energy sector of @xmath162 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sqw_el ] .",
    "the spectral weights are about 10 times smaller compared to the weights of the low - energy part .",
    "the main contribution arises from electronic particle - hole excitations of the effective model .",
    "the specific form of this contribution shows therefore the characteristics of a one - dimensional electron gas : a gapless excitation at @xmath166 and regions between @xmath167 where no excitations are possible .",
    "in addition to the terms describing pure particle - hole excitations there are also terms involving the elementary excitations @xmath112 of the effective spin system .",
    "they are responsible for the broadening of the structures in the high energy sector of @xmath162 .",

    "we obtain a similar peak structure , but in contrast to the results of @xcite the spectral weight of the low energy part is much larger than the spectral weight of the high energy part .",
    "this does not agree with the picture of an exhaustion of the electronic low - energy spin degrees of freedom due to singlet formation described by @xcite .",
    "finally we want to discuss the magnetic excitations of the system of local spin moments described by the dynamic spin structure factor @xmath169 . as in the case of the electronic spin structure factor @xmath170",

    "they assume that this is due to collective spin excitations of the luttinger - liquid . in our approach",

    "this is an artifact and due to the approximations that we have made for the spin operator transformation . by taking into account higher correction terms the transformed spin operator of the local spin moment couples to the spin operator of the conduction electrons",
    "this gives rise to a gapless mode in @xmath169 .",
    "in summary , we used the method of continuous unitary transformations ( flow equation method ) to examine the one - dimensional klm .",
    "the renormalization procedure was employed to integrate out the coupling between conduction electrons and local spin operators . in that way we derived an effective hamiltonian which consists of an one - dimensional noninteracting electron gas and a heisenberg chain interacting via an rkky - like coupling . in order to treat the spin chain we used a schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) .",

    "the new aspect of this work was the extension of calculations for dynamic properties by means of the flow equation s method .",
    "we showed that the electronic spectral functions comprised a coherent quasiparticle - like peak determined by the renormalized electronic dispersion relation .",
    "the coupling to the low - energy excitation of the effective spin model gave an incoherent background comprising two maxima near the quasiparticle - like peaks .",

    "the corresponding spin structure factors always consisted of a low - energy part , determined by the schwinger boson pair excitations , and a high - energy part , mostly determined by electronic particle - hole excitations .",
    "the latter therefore showed the special features of the one - dimensional fermi surface .",
    "the electronic spin structure factor exhibited a gapless mode at @xmath136 .",
    "our results for the electronic spin dynamics did not agree with the exhaustion picture described by @xcite .",

    "<S> the one - dimensional kondo lattice model is investigated by means of wegner s flow equation method . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization procedure leads to an effective hamiltonian which describes a free one - dimensional electron gas and a heisenberg chain . </S>",
    "<S> the localised spins of the effective model are coupled by the well - known rkky interaction . </S>",
    "<S> they are treated within a schwinger boson mean field theory which permits the calculation of static and dynamic correlation functions . in the regime of small interaction strength </S>",
    "<S> static expectation values agree well with the expected luttinger liquid behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 of the luttinger liquid theory is estimated and compared to recent results from density matrix renormalization group studies . </S>"
