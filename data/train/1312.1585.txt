    "the path to finding exoplanets either inhabited or amenable for life as we know it on earth includes the detection in their atmospheres of chemical compounds such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , known as biomarkers ( schindler et al .",
    "2000 , pavlov et al .",
    "2000 , kaltenegger & traub 2007 , traub et al .",
    "another important biomarker is gaseous oxygen , @xmath0 , detected by sagan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) while analyzing the spectrum of earth observed by the galileo probe . in",
    "that spectrum @xmath0 appeared to be , together with @xmath4 in strong thermodynamical disequilibrium , the strongest indicator of life on earth .",
    "@xmath0 has since drawn significant attention because it provides a strong indication of the presence of oxygen - producing forms of life and because it has several spectral absorption bands at visible and near - infrared wavelengths , which can be detected using ground - based telescopes .",
    "the most prominent of those bands are the so - called _ @xmath0  a - band _ around 760 nm , and the @xmath0  band at 1268 nm , with the a - band being the strongest with 55 strong lines .",
    "several studies have now investigated the detectability of @xmath0 for an earth - like exoplanet in the habitable zone of its host star .",
    "the first of those studies was published by schneider ( 1994 ) who analytically calculated the detectability of the @xmath0  a - band by estimating the photometric depth of the absorption produced by the full band , which has a width of @xmath6 3 nm .",
    "computing the ratio of the projected surface areas of the planet s atmosphere and the disk of the star during a transit , this study concluded that it was possible to detect the @xmath0 a - band with a 2.4 meter space - bound telescope , assuming the planet orbits a solar type star at a distance of 2 parsecs or a 0.3 @xmath7 star at 10 parsecs .",
    "webb & wormleaton ( 2001 ) refined the schneider ( 1994 ) analysis by using empirical observations of the earth s @xmath0 a - band to simulate the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet and by superimposing the resultant spectrum with the spectrum of the host star .",
    "their analysis concluded that it is possible to detect the planetary @xmath0 a - band for host stars with r @xmath8 0.3 @xmath7 , although detectability with current 8-meter class telescopes would be limited to m dwarfs with @xmath9 10 .",
    "this study also proposed that a way to confirm that the @xmath0 lines originated in the atmosphere of the exoplanet is that they should be offset from the earth s own @xmath0 lines by an amount equal to the peculiar velocity of the host star .",
    "however , they did not include the telluric @xmath0 a - band in their analysis .",
    "a few years later , kaltenegger & traub ( 2009 ) generated simulations using the earth s atmosphere as proxy to estimate the detectability of biomarkers during the transit of an earth twin around a sun - like star and also around m - dwarfs , for a 6.5-meter telescope in space .",
    "their main conclusion was that the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a single transit would not be enough to detect any spectral features in the atmosphere of an exo - earth orbiting in the habitable zone of those stars . instead , multiple transits would be needed , with an estimate of 6 to 192 transits per year for m0v to m9v stars .",
    "they also concluded that the spectral features of different molecules in the atmosphere of an exo - earth around an m star will be easier to detect in the infrared than in the optical , because the stellar flux peaks in the infrared .",
    "just recently , snellen et al . (",
    "2013 ) extended previous studies by including the effect of the telluric @xmath0 a - band and applying the latest techniques to detect the planet s doppler shift from the ground ( e.g. brogi et al .",
    "2012 , rodler et al .",
    "their simulations show that it will be possible to detect the @xmath0 a - band in the atmosphere of an earth twin if a spectrograph with a spectral resolving power of @xmath10 is installed on the next generation of extremely large telescopes ( elts ) .",
    "in particular , they concluded that the 39-meter e - elt , will be able to detect the @xmath0 a - band transmission signal of a planet around an m5v star by combining the observations of a few dozen transits .",
    "in addition , they remarked that in the case of stars smaller than m7v the @xmath0 might be easier to detect in the @xmath0band at 1268 nm since those stars will be brighter at near - infrared wavelengths than in the visible .    in this paper",
    "we further refine the snellen et al .",
    "( 2013 ) simulations by 1 ) accounting for atmospheric refraction effects in the exoplanet s transmission spectrum and 2 ) including the effect of random and correlated ( atmospheric and instrumental ) observational noise .",
    "in addition , we extend previous studies by exploring the expected performance of instruments for the three upcoming elts , exploring a range of spectral resolutions , and performing simulations for a range of stellar peculiar velocities and spectral types . finally , we explore in detail the feasibility of the observations both in @xmath0 a - band and the @xmath0 band at 1268 nm .    in sections 2 and 3",
    "we describe the implementation and results of our simulations . a discussion of those results and the optimal observational set - up is given in section  4 .",
    "the first step to perform these @xmath0 detection feasibility studies is to generate a set of hypothetical exo - earth transiting planet configurations and observational setups .",
    "the parameters necessary for the simulations are 1 ) a model transmission spectrum of the earth - like planet ( which we assume to be an earth twin , including atmospheric conditions and chemistry ) , 2 ) a model transmission spectrum of earth , 3 ) a model of the spectral emission of the star , including assumptions about the relative velocity of the star with respect to earth , 4 ) a telescope+instrument setup configuration , and 5 ) observational noise models .",
    "the model atmospheric transmission spectrum of the exo - earth was calculated adopting a line - by - line radiative transfer model ( lblrtm ) code based of the fascode algorithm ( clough et al .",
    "2005 ) . as molecular database for oxygen models we adopted hitran ( rothman et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in those calculations we accounted for the effect of refraction in the transmission spectrum of the exo - earth . as described in garcia - muoz et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the transmission spectrum of an earth twin observed transiting its host star will differ from the earth s transmission spectrum because of refraction . refraction is the effect by which light crossing the planet s atmosphere near its surface gets deflected by an angle that depends on the properties of the atmosphere itself , the size of the star , and the orbital distance of the planet .",
    "this effect causes the atmospheric layers close to the planet s surface to be invisible for a remote observer . as a consequence , any chemical species at heights lower than that limit can not be observed . for species distributed over a large range of atmospheric heights , as is the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the depth of their absorption lines will be altered . for e.  g.",
    ", in the particular case of the earth - sun system atmospheric layers at heights lower than 12 - 14 km will be invisible to a remote observer seeing the system transit . in the case of smaller stars , i.e. m - dwarfs , where both the radius of the star and the orbital distance of an earth - like planet in the habitable zone of the system are smaller , only atmospheric altitudes lower than about 5 km appear invisible .    in this work we focus on earth twins orbiting around m - dwarf stars ( see section 2.1.3 ) .",
    "therefore , to simulate this refraction effect we only integrate the model transmission spectrum of the exo - earth at atmospheric layers between 5 km to 85 km from the surface .",
    "85 km marks the end of the earth s mesosphere , with over 99@xmath11 of the atmospheric mass contained below that atmospheric height ( lutgens & tarbuck 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the atmospheric layers above that height to the transmission spectrum of the planet can be considered minuscule .",
    "the resulting model transmission spectrum of the exo - earth around the @xmath0 a - band as well as the @xmath0 band at 1268 nm are illustrated in the top panels figures 1 and 2 .",
    "[ f1 ]    [ f2 ]      the transmission spectrum of earth ( telluric spectrum ) was calculated following the procedure outlined by seifahrt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . like in the previous section",
    ", this procedure uses the lblrtm code developed by clough ( 2005 ) and the transmission molecular absorption database hitran containing the 42 most prominent molecules and isotopes present in the atmosphere of earth . as an input to lblrtm",
    ", we adopted a model of the earth s atmosphere that contains meteorological information for temperature and pressure as a function of height for an average night at a given observatory . in our case",
    "we retrieved the weather information from the global data assimilation system ( gdas ) .",
    "gdas models are available in 3 hour intervals for any location around the globe . by employing lblrtm , we then calculated absorption and emission spectra for a given path through the atmosphere , i.e. for a given airmass .",
    "in our model we have assumed that the observations take place at a ground - based observatory at an altitude of about 2500 meters above sea level , and we have accounted for a changing airmass values during the course of the night within the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the transmission spectrum around the @xmath0 a - band and the @xmath0 band at 1268 nm for an airmass of 1.3 is illustrated as example in the middle panels of figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we note that a few h@xmath14o absorption lines appear in the telluric spectrum around 1290  nm .",
    "these lines partly overlap with the o@xmath14 lines and constitute an additional source of noise . in our simulations",
    ", we have considered the depth of these lines to be constant for simplicity reasons .",
    "in fact , however , the depths of the water absorption lines may strongly vary during the course of a night ( e.g. rodler et al .",
    "2012 ) , an effect that should be implemented in future simulations .      to model the emission from the star , we focus on m - type stars with spectral types m1v  m9v .",
    "the reason for this , as already explained by kaltenegger & traub ( 2009 ) and snellen et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , is that the planetary transit depths are inversely proportional to the squared radius of the star and therefore , the transmission spectrum signal of an exo - earth will be easier to detect around a star with smaller radius . for a star like the sun ( g2v ) , the ratio of the areas between the stellar disk and the atmosphere of an exo - earth s ring is of the order of 5@xmath15 @xmath16 , while for an m1v star that ratio is @xmath6 1.25@xmath15@xmath16 , and for an m9v star the ratio drops to @xmath6 4@xmath15@xmath17 .",
    "we adopted stellar model spectra for effective temperatures and surface pressures corresponding to m1v  m9v stars using the new library of high - resolution spectra based on the phoenix code and presented in husser et al .",
    "this new library has been generated using a new equation of state , which improves the treatment of chemical equilibrium in stellar atmospheres , and updated atomic and molecular line lists .",
    "these new models provide a better match to observed spectra of m dwarfs than the latest phoenix ( brott et al . 2005 ) and atlas9 ( castelli et al . 2003 ) models . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed solar abundances in all the models .",
    "as an example , we show the model spectrum generated for an m4v star with effective temperature @xmath18  k , gravity @xmath19  dex and solar abundances in the bottom panels of figures 1 and 2",
    ".      there are three extremely large telescopes ( elts ) with diameters 24 meters or larger expected to start operations in the next decade .",
    "the smallest of those elts is the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ; www.gmto.org ) with an effective diameter of 24.5 meters .",
    "one of the first light instruments on the gmt will be g - clef ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "2012 ) , which will be a high - resolution spectrograph with resolution modes between r = 25,000120,000 and spectral coverage between 350950 nm , suitable to study the @xmath0 a - band .",
    "the second largest of the elts is the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ; www.tmt.org ) . among the tmt s expected suite of instruments",
    "the best suited to detect @xmath0 in the atmosphere of an earth - like planet is the high resolution optical spectrometer ( hros : crampton et al .",
    "2008 ) , listed among the telescope s _ first decade _ instruments .",
    "hros will provide a resolution of @xmath20 for a 1 arcsec slit , or @xmath21 with an image slicer , and spectral coverage between @xmath6 3101000 nm .",
    "an image slicer is a device that allows to feed a large fraction of the stellar flux into a narrow slit , thereby avoiding slit losses and at the same time allowing to employ high spectral resolving powers ( see e.g. dekker et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the largest of the elts will be the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , with a diameter of 39-meters . in the case of the e - elt ,",
    "there are two spectrographs with resolution @xmath22 being studied on phase a , codex ( pasquini et al . 2010 ) and simple ( origlia et al . 2010 ) .",
    "codex only covers wavelengths up to @xmath6 710 nm , while the wavelength coverage of simple starts at @xmath6 800 nm .",
    "therefore none of these instruments include the @xmath0 a - band at 760 nm .",
    "simple , on the other hand , will cover the @xmath0 band at 1268  nm .",
    "a third high - resolution spectrograph called hires , is now being proposed as one of the first light instruments for the e - elt , although the specifications for this instrument are not defined yet .",
    "the last of the simulation inputs is noise .",
    "the noise in an observed spectrum can be divided into random ( white ) and correlated ( red ) noise . while the distribution of white noise is poissonian and can be reduced by increasing the s /",
    "n of the spectrum , the red noise is not random and can not be reduced by increasing the s / n .",
    "however , the red noise can be related to instrumental and atmospheric effects , such as e.g. variations of airmass or changes of the position of the spectrum on the detector .",
    "analysis techniques have improved in recent years to levels where it is now possible to significantly reduce the amount of red noise in the data .    in our simulations",
    "we have added both sources of noise .",
    "white noise is simulated using a random distribution function with a maximum amplitude set by the s / n of the particular model ( see section 2.2 ) . in the case of red noise ,",
    "its pattern can contain a series of frequencies that depend on the specific cause of the noise for a given dataset .",
    "therefore , we have simulated red noise using the approach described in ( kasdin 1995 ) , by assuming a functional form of 1/f , where @xmath23 is the frequency .",
    "the amplitude of the red noise is set to a fraction of the white noise in an specific model . for our simulations",
    "we consider red noise contributions of 0 to 100@xmath11 of the white noise .",
    "typical red noise levels of ground based data remain of the order of 20@xmath11 of the white noise in the optical and 50 - 100@xmath11 of the white noise in the near - infrared ( see e.g. pont et al .",
    "2006 , rogers et al . 2009 ) .      using the inputs described above we generate model spectra , @xmath24 , using a expression of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26    in these equations",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the speed of light , @xmath28 is the spectrum of the host star , @xmath29 is the transmission spectrum of the planetary atmosphere , and @xmath30 is the telluric spectrum of earth for a given airmass .",
    "@xmath31 is the instrumental profile ( ip ) of the spectrograph . in our simulations ,",
    "we assume the ip to be a gaussian function that degrades the spectral resolution of the combined spectrum to a chosen value .",
    "the remaining parameters in the equations are @xmath32 , the relative stellar velocity with respect to earth ( i.e. systemic velocity and barycentric velocity ) , @xmath33 , the instantaneous radial velocity of the planet with respect to its host star ( which is close to 0  km  s@xmath34 at a primary transit ) , and @xmath35 , the area ratio between the stellar disk and the atmospheric ring of the planet .",
    "once we have computed the spectrum @xmath24 , we interpolate it onto a pixel grid , which simulates a given instrumental layout . since the exact parameters of most instruments described in section 2.1.4 are not yet fully defined , we adopt two different pixel grid scales ; one with a velocity resolution of 0.75  km  s@xmath34  pixel@xmath34 and the other 1.2  km  s@xmath34  pixel@xmath34 .",
    "the 0.75  km  s@xmath34  pixel@xmath34 grid scale corresponds to the planned scale of g - clef for resolutions @xmath36 ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "2012 ) , while the 1.2  km  s@xmath34  pixel@xmath34 grid scale corresponds to uves ( dekker et al . 2000 ) , which is currently mounted at the 8.2 very large telescopes ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) .    the next step is to adjust the flux of the model spectra based on the expected flux of the exo - earth s host star that is received on earth .",
    "given that the potential transiting exo - earth host stars will be at a range of possible distances from earth , and therefore will have different apparent magnitudes , we consider a range of brightnesses for stars of a given spectral type .",
    "( snellen et al . 2013 ) and ( kaltenegger et al . 2009 ) computed the most likely apparent magnitude of a nearby transiting exo - earth host star based on the solar neighbourhood mass function and transit probability of an exo - earth and they provided detectability estimations that are based on that number ( see e.  g.  section 3 in snellen et al .",
    "2013 ) . here",
    "we adopt a different approach and instead of making any assumption about the apparent magnitude of the transiting exo - earth host star , we assume that such star can be at any distance within 20 pc . based on the star s distance , we adjust its apparent magnitude between 1 and 20  pc .",
    "the effective temperature and radius of the stars adopted for each spectral type are listed in table 1 .",
    "the table also shows the values of the area ratio between the stellar ring and the atmospheric ring of the planet , @xmath35 , the i - band and j - band magnitudes of each star at 10 pc , the orbital period of a planet in the middle of the habitable zone of the star based on the definition by kasting ( 1993 ) , and the duration of the transits of such planet .",
    "the flux that we finally measure from a star of a given magnitude will depend on the telescope and instrument throughput .",
    "therefore , we estimated those fluxes using online exposure time calculators ( etc ) for each instrument , whenever available .",
    "for all etcs , we assumed a median seeing of 0.8 \" and airmass values ranging from 1.1 to 2.0 .",
    "g - clef already has an etc , while for simple , we adopted the throughput value estimates listed on the project webpage .",
    "the instrumental layout of hros has not been published yet ; we therefore assumed that hros will be similar to g - clef , with a factor of 1.5 shorter integration times due to the larger diameter of the tmt with respect to the gmt .",
    "for a spectrograph with a uves - like layout , we used the uves etc and scaled the results accordingly to the diameter ratio between the elt and the vlt with 8.2  m. for this instrument , we calculated the s / ns for different slit widths , resulting in different spectral resolving powers .",
    "in addition , we also determined the s / n when employing the uves image slicer # 3 , which has a resolution of @xmath37 ( dekker et al",
    ". 2003 ) .    with the etcs we estimated the exposure time needed to attain the maximum number of counts for each star s apparent magnitude , but at the same time avoiding reaching typical non - linearity regimes of 36  000  adu and 12  000  adu ( in the brightest pixel on the chip ) in a single exposure , respectively for the ccds and near - infrared detectors .",
    "we furthermore accounted for the integration time and the dead time between two exposures to estimate the observations duty cycle for each star .",
    "while for ccds we assumed a dead time of 15 seconds and a read - out noise of 5  electrons per exposure , we accounted for a dead time of 10 seconds and a read - out noise of 10  electrons for infrared detectors .",
    "the maximum single exposure time was chosen to be 600  seconds , since at longer exposures the radial velocity shift of the remote planet would smear out the absorption lines in its atmospheric spectrum .    combining the duty cycle of each star with the flux collected per integration we obtained the total number of photons collected during the duration of one transit ( see last column in table 1 ) .",
    "the duty cycles for each star , for each instrument , are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the remaining columns in these tables are explained in section  3.4 .",
    "finally , we added poisson noise and red noise to each model based on their flux levels ( i.e. s / n ) , following the description in section 2.1.5 . before adding the noise , we scaled each spectrum in such a way that the actual s / n per spectral pixel corresponded to the square root of the flux at that pixel .",
    "this approach ensures that regions of telluric lines as well as stellar absorption lines have a higher noise and a lower s / n than the continuum .",
    "we generated data sets simulating transmission spectra of planetary transits using eqs .  1 and 2 with the following range of parameters , @xmath38 to @xmath39  km  s@xmath34 , @xmath40 , depending on the spectral type of the host star , and spectral resolutions of @xmath41 , as well as a set of s / n levels including red noise contributions from 0 to 100@xmath11 of the white noise level .",
    "in each data set , we simulated the observations during a night .",
    "hence , each data set consisted of a series of spectra , which differed from each other by the airmass and the instantaneous radial velocity shift of the planetary transmission spectrum ( @xmath42 ) with respect to its host star during transit . additionally , we factored in the effects of the change of the barycentric velocity of the star plus its planet during the course of a night , which is of the order of a few times 100  m  s@xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , to rule out selection effects coming from the adopted pixel grid , we also varied the zero - point of the pixel grid up to the average velocity span of one pixel .",
    "the duration of the datasets corresponds to twice the duration of the transits listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "to analyze each transit dataset in search for the extraterrestrial signal of @xmath0 , we followed the approach outlined in rodler et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2013 ) and removed both a model telluric spectrum and a model stellar spectrum from each synthetic spectrum , thereby calculating a residual spectrum which  ideally  only contained the transmission spectrum of the planet , plus noise .",
    "we then carried out cross - correlations between the residual spectrum and the transmission model spectrum of the exo - earth , and determined the cross - correlation function .",
    "for all spectra of each data set , we then summed up the cross - correlation functions in the rest frame of the planet and determined the radial velocity value that yielded the highest correlation ( candidate feature ) .    to determine the number of false positives ( i.e. the confidence level of the candidate feature ) , we employed a bootstrap randomization method ( e.g. rodler et al .",
    "random values of the orbital phases were assigned to the observed spectra , thereby creating @xmath43 different data sets ( @xmath44 in our analyses ) .",
    "any signal present in the original data was then scrambled in these artificial data sets . for all these randomized data sets , we re - ran the data analysis in the given parameter search ranges and located the candidate feature with its maximum value .",

    ", we find that the optimum velocity range of the planet host star with respect to the earth is limited to two small velocity windows , ranging from @xmath90(15 to 30 )  km  s@xmath34 .    in figure  11",
    "we show the distribution of absolute values of the barycentric radial velocities for a sample of 176 m - dwarfs reported by chubak et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . assuming that the distribution of radial velocities in that sample is representative of all nearby m - dwarfs",
    ", we can conclude that the majority of them have barycentric radial velocities between -15 and 15  km  s@xmath34 .",
    "therefore , what is the amount of time of optimum visibility of those objects , i.e. when they show relative radial velocities of @xmath90(15 to 30 )  km  s@xmath34 ? to answer this question , we need to account for the barycentric velocity of the earth , which causes a periodical radial velocity shift with a semi - amplitude @xmath103 of approximately 29.8  km  s@xmath34 for an object located close to the ecliptic plane . however , the semi - amplitude of the barycentric velocity is a function of the ecliptic latitude @xmath104 ( i.e. the angular distance of the object from the orbital plane ) : @xmath105 for the vast majority of stars , the semi - amplitude of the barycentric velocity @xmath103 is between 20 and 29.8  km  s@xmath34 .    figure  12 shows the amount of time of optimum visibility of an object in units of the yearly observing time available at an ideal observing site . for this estimation , we assumed that the object can be observed at an airmass @xmath106 between 2 hours and 8 hours ( at opposition with earth ) .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we assumed a circular orbit of earth and factored in the instantaneous value of the barycentric velocity of the object .",
    "figure  12 depicts that for semi - amplitudes of the barycentric velocity of @xmath107  km  s@xmath34 , the atmospheric lines from the planet would be detectable a fraction of 0.2 to 0.4 of the time for the majority of the m - dwarfs , which have instrinsic radial velocities between -15 and 15  km  s@xmath34 .    to understand possible error sources in the data analysis",
    ", we briefly review the main steps : we remove both the telluric spectrum as well as the stellar spectrum from the data , and finally attempt to retrieve the planetary signature from the residual spectrum via cross - correlation .",
    "the removal of both spectra is an iterative process , which involves the determination of the ip and the convolution of the stellar + telluric model spectra with the ip ( the method is outlined in rodler et al .",
    "while the telluric spectrum can be well reproduced with theoretical model spectra , the modeling of m - dwarf spectra is still in its infancy . in principle , if the instrument is stable during one night , it would be sufficient to take spectra of the star for some hours before and after the transit , subtract the telluric lines , then co - add these spectra to form one high - s / n spectrum for that night , which is then subtracted from the observed spectrum taken during the transit ( cf . procedure used by rodler et al .",
    "however , this procedure would drastically boost the need of observing time .",
    "detailed studies on the modeling of m - dwarf spectra are clearly required .    additionally , it is crucial to discard strong telluric features in the data analysis .",
    "we want to make future observers aware that regions which show a s / n ratio less than about 0.4 times the s / n ratio in the continuum of the spectrum should be masked out . adopting a wrong cut - off parameter causes the the weak planetary signal to be suppressed .",
    "another possible error noise constitutes the model spectrum of the planet atmosphere , which is adopted in the cross - correlation .",
    "we are attempting to detect a very weak planetary signal of the planetary atmosphere ; the lack of some absorption features in the theoretical model would suppress the planetary signal in the cross - correlation function .",
    "to avoid this situation , a large numbers of atmospheric models with different mixing ratios and molecular configurations need to be probed .",
    "we conclude that successful measurements of @xmath0 in earth - like atmospheres with future ground - based instrumentation will be most likely limited to host stars of spectral types later than m3v , which are located at distances less than 8  pc .",
    "our simulations demonstrate , that a @xmath47 discovery of @xmath0 in the atmosphere of such a planet would require even tenths of transits and several years of observing time at elts .",

    "<S> in addition , our simulations show that , when accounting for typical noise levels associated to observations in the optical and near - infrared , the @xmath0 a - band at 760 nm is more favorable to detect the exoplanetary signal than the @xmath0 band at 1268 nm for all the spectral types , except m9v . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , unless unpredicted instrumental limitations arise , the implementation of pre - slit optics such as image slicers appear to be key to significantly improve the yield of this particular science case . however , even in the most optimistic cases , we conclude that the detection of @xmath0 in the atmosphere of an earth twin will be only feasible with the elts if the planet is orbiting a bright close - by ( d @xmath1 8 pc ) m - dwarf with a spectral type later than m3 . </S>"
