    "the richness of interstellar chemistry has been growing steadily with the variety of objects and regions observed .",

    "we can trace the cycle of matter for interstellar space into stars and planets , and back again into the interstellar space @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing body of evidence for the existence of large molecules in the interstellar medium and in the interplanetary space .",
    "interferometric observations of high - mass star forming regions in molecular clouds have revealed hot molecular cores , short - lived remnants of clouds not incorporated into the newly born massive stars .",
    "these hot cores contain within them the evaporated material of ices deposited on dust grain surfaces during the collapse , and observations show a very interesting chemistry .",
    "in particular , there exist substantial column densities of large partly hydrogen - saturated molecules , many of them being of pre - biotic interest .",
    "some of these species have been also observed in comets and embedded in minor bodies of the solar system @xcite .",
    "the study of biologically interesting large interstellar molecules offers the exciting opportunity of learning more about the chemical evolution preceding the onset of life on the early earth 4.5 billion years ago .",
    "comets may be important carriers of prebiotic chemistry , and relevant agents in the delivery of complex organics to early earth , as well as to newly formed planets .    the sgr b2 molecular cloud complex is the prime target in the search for complex species , in particular in a hot core , the so - called large molecule heimat , sgr b2(n - lmh ) , within the more extended molecular cloud .",
    "in this compact source , smaller than the oort cloud ( @xmath0  pc ) with a mass of several thousands m@xmath1 @xcite , an extraordinary number of complex organics have been observed to exhibit very high column densities ( e.g. amino acetonitrile , @xcite ) .",
    "large partly hydrogen - saturated species challenge the completeness of the standard ion - neutral scheme in interstellar chemistry , suggesting that reactions on dust grains are involved in their formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .    of the chemical species detected so far ,",
    "particular attention has been paid to the formation of different isomer groups . in this work ,",
    "we focus on c@xmath2h@xmath3o@xmath2 , i.e. acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh ) , glycolaldehyde ( hcoch@xmath5oh ) , and methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath4 ) , because of their potential role in the origin of life ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "glycolaldehyde , the simplest of the monosaccharide sugars , has first been detected by @xcite towards sgr b2(n - lmh ) , and its most recently determined column density in that source is @xmath6  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it has been recently observed outside the galactic center by @xcite towards the hot molecular core g31.41 + 0.31 , with the emission coming from the hot and dense region closest to the protostars .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite presented an upper limit for glycolaldehyde abundance in the comet hale - bopp .",
    "acetic acid shares the c@xmath8c@xmath8o backbone with glycine , from which it differs by an amino group ( nh@xmath2 ) .",
    "first detected by @xcite in sgr b2(n - lmh ) , acetic acid shows a column density of @xmath9  @xmath7 in that region @xcite .",
    "finally , methyl formate , discovered towards sgr b2(n ) by @xcite , has been also observed in other star forming regions of both high @xcite and low @xcite mass , towards a proto - planetary nebula @xcite , and in comets @xcite .",
    "the column density of methyl formate in sgr b2(n - lmh ) is @xmath10  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "sgr b2(n - lmh ) is the only source where all three of these isomers have been observed .",
    "however , while acetic acid and methyl formate are concentrate in sgr b2(n - lmh ) , glycolaldehyde appears to be more diffusely spread through sgr b2(n ) @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is generally shared by other aldehydes @xcite . in comets",
    "only methyl formate has been observed so far .",
    "an understanding of molecular structure , spectroscopy , and photo - absorption processes may be of critical importance in interpreting current observations .",
    "in particular , the lifetime of cometary molecules versus photo - destruction is a basic parameter for all cometary studies : as a matter of fact any error in the photodissociation rate translates linearly into an error on the abundance derived in the cometary nucleus .",
    "it is also needed for chemical modeling of planetary atmospheres . in this work ,",
    "we derive electronic and vibrational properties of the isomer triplet c@xmath2h@xmath3o@xmath2 described above using the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "photo - destruction rates for acetic acid and methyl formate were derived by @xcite using old laboratory absorption data published by @xcite , while the rate for glycolaldehyde is just an estimate . in section",
    "[ theory ] we present a brief outline of the method , together with a description of computational settings and results .",
    "section  [ comets ] contains the application of these results to cometary photochemistry , while discussion and conclusions are in the last section .",
    "we used dft ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) for the calculation of the equilibrium geometry of the electronic ground state and of the vibrational spectrum .",
    "we then applied the time - dependent extension of the theory to compute the electronic excited states and the resulting photoabsorption spectrum for each molecule . to obtain the groundstate optimised geometries we used the quantum chemistry program package turbomole @xcite .",
    "technical details about the specific choice of density functional and atomic basis set can be found in the appendix .",
    "after geometry optimisation , we performed the vibrational analysis obtaining energies and intensities of the normal modes of vibration in the harmonic approximation .",
    "vibrational transitions for fundamental configurations of the isomer triplet are given in the appendix .    finally , keeping fixed the ground state geometries obtained above , we computed the photoabsorption crosssection for each molecule .",
    "we used two different implementations of tddft in the linear response regime , in conjunction with different representations of the kohnsham wavefunctions :    1 .",
    "[ one ] the realtime propagation scheme using a grid in real space @xcite , as implemented in the octopus computer program @xcite ; 2 .",
    "[ two ] the frequencyspace implementation @xcite based on the linear combination of localised orbitals , as given in turbomole .    in the realtime propagation scheme _",
    "( i ) _ the whole photoabsorption crosssection of the molecule , up to the faruv , is obtained at once , which is particularly convenient for astrophysical applications .",
    "technical details about the tddft formalism implemented in the octopus program are reported in the appendix ; the resulting spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the most widely used frequencyspace implementation _",
    "( ii ) _ the poles of the linear response function correspond to vertical excitation energies and the pole strengths to the corresponding oscillator strengths . with this method",
    "computational costs scale steeply with the number of required transitions ; electronic excitations are thus usually limited to the lowenergy part of the spectrum .",
    "table  [ poba ] shows that both combinations bptzvp and b3lyptzvp ( see the appendix for the nomenclature ) provide a similarly good agreement between the computed transitions and the experimental results available for acetic acid at room temperature @xcite , while bptzvp results in a much closer agreement with the experimental results for glycolaldehyde @xcite .",
    "we therefore chose to use the bp functional for all of our calculations .",
    "the resulting bptzvp absorption spectra for the three molecules , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , are obtained as a superposition of gaussian functions with fixed arbitrary widths of 0.8  ev .",
    "the kind of calculations we performed only yield the positions and intensities of vertical , pure electronic transitions , and therefore give no information on band widths .",
    "however , in the available gasphase spectra of acetic acid @xcite and glycolaldehyde @xcite bands up to @xmath11  ev show broad profiles with a full width at half maximum of about 0.8  ev , produced by the convolution of unresolved vibronic structure and the natural width of the transitions .",
    "the list of first 50 excited states and transition intensities is given in the appendix .",
    "the two tddft implementations produce compatible results in the lowenergy region , i.  e. up to about 10  ev , while they tend to diverge significantly at higher energies .",
    "however , tddft , as a method , is known to yield dependable results for individual transitions only for excitation energies up to the ionisation energy , which indeed is close to @xmath11  ev for all three isomers .",
    "the realtime realspace implementation , on the other hand , has been demonstrated to yield good results for the overall density of electronic transitions even at high energies , with the _ caveat _ that single peaks of fine structure are meaningless ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : at energies @xmath12  ev only the _ envelope _ of the spectra calculated by octopus is expected to be accurate , while the resolved fine structure is largely due to standing waves in the finite simulation box , is strongly dependent on the size of the box and is only partly quenched by the absorbing boundary conditions we adopted .",
    "since we use these spectra at high energies to compute absorption rates in a continuous spectrum ( see sect .",
    "[ comets ] ) , the effect of spurious fine structure averages out when integrating over ranges of many evs , making these theoretical spectra quite adequate for their intended purpose .",

    "photo - absorption rates of the three isomers are computed by means of the relation @xmath14 where , for the sake of comparison , @xmath15 is the solar spectrum at 1 au provided by @xcite , and @xmath16 the photoabsorption crosssection for a given molecule .",
    "the resulting photoabsorption rates are reported in table  [ sole ] , where we also show results for a radiation density expected in a photodissociation front near an ob star @xcite .",
    "we also list separately the contribution of the ly@xmath17 line in the solar spectrum to the absorption rates , which is of the order of @xmath1815% of the total , in agreement with previous estimates of @xcite . as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table  [ stigazzi ] , glycolaldehyde presents a relatively strong band near 4.5  ev , at an energy @xmath182  ev lower than the first transitions of comparable intensity in the other two members of the triplet ( namely @xmath186.9  ev for acetic acid and @xmath187.5  ev for methyl formate ) . since the solar spectral distribution decreases very steeply in this energy range ,",
    "the estimated glycolaldehyde photoabsorption rate in the solar radiation field is by and large dominated by this single band , and results to be more than 100 times larger than those of acetic acid and methyl formate .",
    "this effect is not present for photoabsorption rates estimated for the @xcite spectrum , since it is much flatter than the solar one in the uv , and thus no single band dominates the absorption for any of the three species .",
    "tddft calculations are known to provide transition energies accurate within about 0.3  ev . to test the robustness of our results we shifted the energies of all transitions by @xmath190.3  ev , and checked how this affects the resulting photoabsorption rates .",
    "also , since tddft provides no information on the intrinsic width of the calculated bands , we assumed for all bands a fullwidth at half maximum of @xmath180.8  ev , consistent with published experimental data @xcite .",
    "the overall variations in photoabsorption rates are within a factor of 2 , meaning that our conclusions are rather firm .",
    "this accuracy may appear surprising for the estimated absorption rates in the ly@xmath17 line , which would naively be expected to vary very strongly with the calculated positions of molecular bands , producing either a very large absorption rate if it happens to be close to a strong one or a very small one if it falls in a gap in the absorption spectrum ; however , the assumption ( based on experimental data ) of a 0.8  ev fwhm for all bands vastly reduces the dependence of absorption rates on small ( i.  e. @xmath180.3  ev ) variations in band positions .",
