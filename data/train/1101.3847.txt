    "one of the key issues in cosmological studies is to understand the physical processes related to the structure formation in the universe . in the cold dark matter scenario ,",
    "gravitational effects play essential roles in amplifying small density fluctuations generated in the early universe to shape the large - scale structures seen today .",
    "being directly associated with galaxies and clusters of galaxies , virialized dark matter halos have been widely studied theoretically and observationally .",
    "their mass function , which describes statistically the formation and evolution of dark matter halos , is shown by numerical simulations to follow a functional form universally valid for a wide range of cosmological models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a universality can be largely explained in the context of halo model which links initial density fluctuations to nonlinear dark matter halos through gravitational collapse models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considerable efforts have been made to improve the spherical collapse model to include more realistic characteristics in the modeling .",
    "it has long been realized that the anisotropic features contained in the initial density fluctuations can be magnified by nonlinear gravity @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the collapse of a region first happens along the direction with the largest eigenvalue of the linear deformation tensor , thus leading to a sheet - like structure .",
    "subsequent collapse along the direction of the second largest eigenvalue contracts the sheet structure to a filament .",
    "a halo can eventually form once further collapse occurs in the remaining direction .",
    "an ellipsoidal collapse model is developed to extend these considerations to the nonlinear regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the peak - patch scenario further includes the external tidal force self - consistently into consideration and improves the modeling of gravitational collapse around initial density peaks @xcite . @xcite and @xcite incorporate the peak - patch scenario into the excursion set approach in an averaged way .",
    "they first obtain statistically the averaged shape parameters of the initial tidal field .",
    "these averaged parameters are then used in the peak - patch ellipsoidal collapse model to derive the collapse criterion .",
    "it is noticed that on average , the halo formation is delayed due to the anisotropy of the gravitational effects . the predicted halo mass function ( mf hereafter ) is then in good agreements with that from numerical simulations .",
    "being very important in the hierarchy of large - scale structures , virialized dark matter halos of galaxy scale and above contain only @xmath6 of the total mass in the universe .",
    "majority of the mass is distributed outside these large halos . in the language of halo model , the dominant fraction of the mass in the universe is contained in numerous small halos down to very low mass depending on the physical properties of dark matter particles .",
    "these small halos present anisotropic clustering patterns in space , and form , together with the massive halos , cosmic web structures . from the view point of the large halos ,",
    "their formation and evolution are affected mainly by the clustering properties of the surrounding small halos as a whole .",
    "thus to the zeroth order , the mass distribution around a large halo can be described by a smooth component without considering the individuality of small halos .",
    "this approach is clearly stated in the peak - patch scenario @xcite . in the framework of the excursion set theory ,",
    "@xcite introduce filaments and sheets to model the large - scale mass distribution within which virialized halos are embedded . in their analyses ,",
    "filaments are treated as an intermediate state of the ellipsoidal collapse when the collapse finishes along two directions .",
    "then these filaments represent the smoothed version of the anisotropic mass distribution around fully collapsed halos .",
    "various approaches have been proposed to geometrically define filamentary structures in cosmological simulations and observations .",
    "for example tessellation method is introduced to reconstruct the density field , and the edge between tessellations naturally constitutes a segment of filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second order derivatives , namely , hessian matrix , of the tidal field or the density field , is also widely used to classify halos , filaments , sheets and voids according to the signs of the eigenvalues of the matrix ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite propose the so called candy model for filament finding , in which a marked point process with a set of chosen parameters is used to reject points at disfavored directions and to locate elongated filamentary segments .",
    "these geometrically defined filaments , however , can not be directly associated with the excursion - set - based filaments in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of long geometrically defined filaments may not be dominated by the local field .",
    "therefore they may break at the saddle point and accrete into the two ends separately during the late evolution .",
    "furthermore , many geometrical definitions of filaments concentrate on the features of their spatial distribution rather than give rise to countable filamentary objects . to emphasize their dynamical structures and to compare with the results of the excursion set theory , in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider supercluster - like filamentary structures .",
    "we adopt a simple but natural definition of filaments by connectivity .",
    "specifically , we first obtain the density field on a set of grids from particle positions in a simulation .",
    "then the site percolation algorithm is applied to link cells together into groups by specifying a linking density threshold . at a high enough density threshold ,",
    "only virialized halos are expected to be identified . at lower thresholds ,",
    "filamentary superclusters surrounding virialized halos are located .",
    "the global percolation of the cosmic web occurs when the linking density threshold reaches a lower critical value .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 . from top",
    "left to bottom right , the linking density thresholds are @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "as we will discuss later , the groups identified at @xmath8 correspond to virialized halos . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the individual structures seen in the plot are related to filaments defined in @xcite . at @xmath9 , we see the global percolation , and a large structure with a scale comparable to the size of the simulation box appears . at lower linking thresholds , the global cosmic web gets smoother .",
    "it should be noted however , that even for @xmath10 , the global web structure can still be seen clearly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 presents our method in detail . in  3 , we analyze the mass function and the occupation statistics of the identified groups with different linking density thresholds . in  4 , we compare our results from simulations with predictions of the excursion set theory .",
    "shape statistics are given in  5 .",
    " 6 contains summaries and discussions .",
    "to study the statistical properties of filamentary objects , we analyze sets of publicly available numerical simulations from gif project ( http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de.gif ) and virgo project ( http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/virgo ) , which cover a range of cosmological models and simulation parameters .",
    "in addition , we also include in our analyses three @xmath11cdm simulations kindly provided by y.p.jing @xcite .",
    "the relevant simulation parameters are listed in table 1 and table 2",

    "we thus choose the latter algorithm , which has good enough accuracies for these large structures and can be much faster than the particle - based fof operations .",
    "the site percolation allows us to find different types of structures by specifying different linking densities .",

    "thus as a test for our site - percolation - based group analyses , we first study the mass function of dark matter halos identified with our algorithm . as discussed in  2 , our percolation groups with the linking density threshold @xmath8 correspond well to fof dark matter halos with the linking length @xmath14 .",
    "we then define these groups as halos .",

    "the heavy solid line is the result of the jenkins mass function , and the dashed line is for the sheth - tormen mass function .",
    "as expected , the universality of the mass function for the site - percolation halos is clearly seen , and both the jenkins and the sheth - tormen functional forms can fit the simulation results very well .",
    "we now turn to groups identified with lower linking density thresholds .",
    "when the density threshold decreases from the halo threshold @xmath8 , low density regions surrounding virialized halos are included in groups .",
    "nearby halos can also merge into larger filamentary - like objects .",
    "when the density threshold approaches the average matter density of the universe , the global cosmic web extending to the whole simulation box can be identified . a natural question raised here",
    "is whether a universal mass function also exists for these supercluster - like groups . to investigate this , for each simulation in table 2",
    ", we construct different sets of group catalogs identified with different linking density thresholds , from the cosmic average density to the density threshold for virialized halos and to even higher thresholds . for",
    "each given threshold , we analyze and compare the mass functions of groups from different simulations .",
    "it is found that for a wide range of linking density thresholds , the universality of the mass function remains . in figure 5 , we show the mass functions for groups with the density threshold @xmath5 .",
    "the line styles for different simulations are the same as those in figure 4 .",
    "it is seen clearly that the mass function scaled with the quantity @xmath66 obeys a universal form to the level comparable to that of halos .    to a certain extent , the universality of the mass function for groups beyond halos can be understood qualitatively in the same way as for virialized halos . for groups corresponding to relatively low linking density thresholds , although they have not been fully virialized , their average densities are already high enough ( see figure 3 ) so that their own gravity dominates their dynamical evolution .",
    "in other words , these groups can be regarded as isolated structures that are in the intermediate stages toward forming virialized halos . considering the process of gravitational collapse of an isolated region , as long as all the dependence on cosmology and redshift",
    "can be cast into the extrapolated linear density perturbations , just as in the spherical and ellipsoidal collapse models , the process can be described in a universal way . consequently , a universal mass function for these groups is expected .",
    "on the other hand , it is also expected that the universality of the mass function should break down when the linking density threshold reaches a low enough level for the occurrence of global cosmic web structures .",
    "we find that the global percolation occurs at @xmath67 , and indeed the mass function for groups with that linking density threshold and lower does not show a universal behavior anymore .",
    "the global percolation will be discussed in detail in  3.3 .",
    "the universality of mass functions for supercluster - like groups raises a possibility for us to find an analytical form for mass functions that is generalized from that of dark matter halos .",
    "we consider the jenkins form of eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the sheth - tormen form of eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "as seen from figure 4 and figure 5 , the universal behavior of the mass function depends on the linking density threshold .",
    "thus when we fit the functional forms to the simulation results , we expect that the best fitted values for the parameters in eq .",

    ", we will consider more general fitting to further discuss the relation between our results and the excursion set theory .",
    "the heavy dashed line in figure 5 shows our best fit result with eq .",
    "( 3 ) for groups with @xmath5 .",
    "it is seen that the two - parameter ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) sheth - tormen functional form can fit the low - mass end of the mass function rather well . at high mass end , however , the model gives a poor fit to the simulation results .",
    "this indicates that the simple excursion set theory can not apply directly to low - density groups . as we will discuss in the next section ,",
    "this should be related to the well known peak - exclusion effect @xcite . for low - density groups ,",
    "such effect is stronger than that for high - density halos , and thus the deviation between the sheth - tormen fitting and the simulations is more apparently seen in figure 5 than that in figure 4 for halos .    for jenkins form of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we regard it as an empirical form , and thus all the three parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are treated as free parameters in our fitting .",
    "we then find that eq .",
    "( 2 ) can fit the mass function of groups with different linking density thresholds very well .",
    "we further obtain a generalized fitting for the three parameters that is applicable to all the groups in consideration , from halos with the linking density @xmath8 to low - density groups with @xmath70 .",

    "the generalized jenkins mass function obtained here allows us to perform statistically the abundance analyses not only for halos but also for more extended low - density groups .",
    "its cosmological applications will be explored in our future studies .",
    "several weak lensing measurements reveal the existence of massive dark clumps with unusually high mass - to - light ratios ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one proposed explanation is that those dark clumps may arise from the projection effect of low - density filaments with their elongations happening to be near the line of sight .",
    "galaxies within these low density areas are thought to be less clustered than that in high density clusters of galaxies of similar mass .",
    "however , the proper question concerned in the dark clump problem should be whether a filament has significantly less projected number of galaxies than that of a cluster of the same projected mass . in other words , it is more or less the total number of galaxies contained in a filament or in a cluster that matters .",
    "numerical studies show that the gravitational effects determine dominantly the occupation statistics of galaxies in a halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the subhalo occupation statistics can give important information on the occupation distribution of galaxies .",
    "here we compare filament occupation distribution ( fod ) of subhalos with halo occupation distribution ( hod ) of subhalos . for fod , we define groups picked up with the linking density threshold @xmath5 as filaments , in accordance with the definition of @xcite ( see  4 ) . for each filament",
    ", we count the number of halos inside it .",
    "as discussed previously , halos with @xmath80 can not be well resolved with our site - percolation group finder due to the grid effects .",
    "thus here for occupation analyses , we use the particle fof method with the linking length parameter @xmath14 to find halos in filaments . for high - density virialized halos , we do not directly count the subhalos inside them because the simulations we used have limited dynamical resolutions .",
    "instead , we adopt the hod fitting result for the average number of subhalos with minimum mass @xmath81 from @xcite , which is given by @xmath82 where @xmath22 is the host halo mass , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the results of the occupation distribution are presented in figure 6 .",
    "the horizontal axis is for the mass @xmath22 of the host filament / halo in unit of @xmath81 .",
    "we limit our analyses to @xmath86 in accordance with the relatively low numerical resolutions of the simulations used . for the same reason and also concerning galactic - scale subhalos , we take @xmath87 .",

    "the red solid line shows the average value of @xmath88 from the red dots .",
    "the average hod from eq .",
    "( 7 ) for virialized host halos is shown as the black solid line .",
    "naive comparison between the black and red solid lines indeed leads to the conclusion that the number of subhalos in a high - density virialized halo is statistically larger than that contained in a low - density filament of the same mass .",
    "it should be noted , however , that we find halos in a low - density filament by particle fof group finder with @xmath14 .",
    "these halos can have mass well above that of the typical galactic halo , and thus are expected to further contain subhalos of galactic scale in them .",
    "those subhalos can not be adequately identified in our simulation analyses due to the limited dynamical resolutions . on the other hand , in the studies of @xcite ,",
    "they use high resolution simulations and their halo finder can resolve well subhalos and even sub - subhalos .",
    "thus the red solid line and the black solid line in figure 6 can not be directly comparable .    to make a more meaningful comparison between the occupation statistics of virialized halos and that of filaments , we need to add subhalos into the halos in filaments",
    ". then for each halo found in a filament , we adopt eq . ( 7 ) as the average value to randomly assign a number of subhalos to it . the corresponding modified fod results are shown in blue dots in figure 6 .",
    "the blue solid line is the average of the blue dots . we see that the blue solid line lies above the black solid line , showing that after taking into account subhalos , the average fod result is actually larger by @xmath89 than that of hod of the same mass .",
    "such a difference may be understood as follows .",
    "considering two large halos in a low - density filament with one of them being the largest halo in the filament .",
    "when the filament evolves further to form a virialized halo , the less massive halo is very likely to merge into the largest one and loses its identity , thus reducing the number of occupation by @xmath90 .",
    "therefore if there is a proportional relation between the subhalo fod / hod and galaxy fod / hod , the mass - to - light ratio for a filament is comparable and can be even lower than that of a cluster of the same mass , leading to difficulties for the filament interpretation of dark clumps . on the other hand , although close relations between the occupation distribution of subhalos and that of galaxies are expected , differences between the two can exist .",
    "thus detailed analyses of galaxy occupation distribution are further needed concerning the quantitative interpretation of dark clumps with filaments .    in figure 6 ,",
    "the red and blue dashed lines are the second moments , defined as @xmath91 , of the distributions of the red and blue dots , respectively .",
    "the red dashed line lies above the red solid line , showing the super - poisson behavior for the fod in the case without adding subhalos into halos in filaments .",
    "considering subhalos in halos , the blue dashed line is nearly the same as the blue solid line , and the distribution of the blue dots is consistent with the poisson distribution .",
    "this is because we add in subhalos assuming the poisson distribution in accordance with the hod analyses of @xcite .",
    "the large - scale connected cosmic web is the most striking feature seen in numerical simulations as well as in large galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "both the power spectrum of initial density perturbations and late - time nonlinear gravitational interactions play important roles in shaping the cosmic - web structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "some of them merge into the cosmic web . however , there are still isolated halos left even at @xmath10 .",

    ", they test the applicability of the excursion set theory for virialized halos against simulations . they obtain the collapse barrier directly from simulations by tracing the collapse of virialized regions .",
    "they conclude that while the barrier is consistent with that from the ellipsoidal collapse model , the mass function from the excursion set theory with the obtained barrier is not in a good agreement with that from simulations .",

    "for a particle away from the central region of the peak , the gravitational interaction can drag the particle into the group . however , the average linear density fluctuation at the position of that particle obtained by applying a spherical smoothing centered on itself over the scale corresponding to @xmath22 can be lower than the collapse barrier .",
    "thus the particle is statistically assigned to lower mass groups in the excursion approach .",
    "this can lead to over predictions of low mass groups in comparison with those from simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is expected that such an off - center problem can have more significant effects on low - density supercluster - like groups , such as filamentary groups , than those of high - density virialized halos .    to overcome this , @xcite propose the peak - patch theory for halos . in this approach ,",
    "density peaks in the linear density fluctuation field smoothed over different scales are found .",
    "those peaks with heights above the collapse barrier are potential halo centers .",
    "the differential mass function at mass @xmath22 is then related to the derivatives of the number of peaks with respect to the smoothing scale at @xmath22 .",

    "the average excursion set theory on random particles in lagrangian space is widely used because it is believed that it should resemble statistically the peak excursion theory . however , to compare with the mass function from simulations , there is an important additional step in the peak excursion approach , namely , the peak exclusion , which is used to trim off overlapped peaks .",
    "to certain extent , it is expected that the peak exclusion should largely remove the off - center problem in the average excursion set theory discussed in the previous paragraph . to see",
    "if this is the case , we perform the following analyses . instead of trimming out peaks in the excursion approach ,",
    "we add in small - scale structures back to groups found in our simulations .",

    "the good agreement between the red dashed line and red solid lines shows that taking into account the peak exclusion effects ( in a reversed way here ) , the excursion set theory with the barrier given by the ellipsoidal collapse model of @xcite with adjusted @xmath113 can describe well the mass function of filaments . in this sense , it is appropriate for us to define groups identified with the linking density threshold @xmath5 as filaments .",
    "the analyses shown in this subsection demonstrate the importance of the peak exclusion effects in the excursion set theory , especially when it is applied to model the mass function of low - density filamentary groups . without considering such effects , the average excursion set theory predicts significantly more low - mass filaments than those identified in simulations .      in the excursion set theory , the conditional mass function of objects can be analyzed by invoking two sets of barriers that are appropriate for the two classes of structures in consideration .",

    "thus the differences seen in figure 11 should stem mainly from the excursion approach itself .",
    "the off - center problem discussed in  4.1 can lead to an underestimation of merging probability and thus an overestimation of the abundance of low - mass objects .",
    "although this problem is not apparent for @xmath125 , the average halo mass function , it can have significant effects on the conditional mass function @xmath121 due to the relatively high - density environment .",

    "the simulation results shown as histograms appear to be rather extended . on the other hand , the results from the excursion set theory all have sharp peaks at @xmath126 .",

    "in such a case , the excursion approach can describe well the conditional mass function @xmath122 as expected .",
    "however , for filaments with @xmath128 , they normally have multiple halos in them , and are likely the merging products of progenitor filaments each with a considered halo in it . thus to understand the behavior of @xmath122 , one needs to understand well the merging process of filaments . as we discussed earlier ,",
    "the off - center problem in the excursion set approach is especially severe in explaining the formation of large filaments .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study large - scale structures from numerical simulations , paying particular attention to supercluster - like structures . </S>",
    "<S> a grid - density - contour based algorithm is adopted to locate connected groups . with the increase of the linking density threshold from the cosmic average density , </S>",
    "<S> the foam - like cosmic web is subsequently broken into individual supercluster - like groups and further halos . to be in accordance with normal fof halos with the linking length of @xmath0 in unit of the average separation of particles , halos in this paper </S>",
    "<S> are defined as groups with the linking density threshold @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the grid density , @xmath3 is the average mass density of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> groups with lower linking densities are then generally referred to as supercluster - like groups . by analyzing sets of cosmological simulations with varying cosmological parameters , we find that a universal mass function exists not only for halos but also for low - density supercluster - like groups until the linking density threshold decreases to @xmath4 where the global percolation of large - scale structures occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the mass functions of different groups can be well described by the jenkins form with the parameters being dependent on the linking density threshold . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , these low - density supercluster - like groups can not be directly associated with the predictions from the excursion set theory with effective barriers obtained from dynamical collapse models , and the peak exclusion effect must be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> including such an effect , the mass function of groups with the linking density threshold @xmath5 is in good agreements with that from the excursion set theory with a nearly flat effective barrier . </S>",
    "<S> a simplified analysis of the ellipsoidal collapse model indicates that the barrier for collapses along two axes to form filaments is approximately flat in scales . </S>",
    "<S> thus in our analyses , we define groups identified with @xmath5 as filaments . </S>",
    "<S> we then further study the halo - filament conditional mass function and the filament - halo conditional mass function , and compare them with the predictions from the two - barrier excursion set theory . </S>",
    "<S> the shape statistics for filaments are also presented . </S>"
