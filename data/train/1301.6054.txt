    "superconductivity in the tetragonal thcr@xmath1si@xmath1-type srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 was discovered first in polycrystalline @xcite and later in single crystals @xcite with the superconducting phase transition temperature ( @xmath14 ) at 3.0 k and 2.7 k , respectively . the upper critical field ( @xmath15 )",
    "was estimated to be 4920 oe at @xmath16 by using helfand - werthamer ( hw ) theory @xcite based on the experimental data obtained only down to @xmath17.@xcite it has been found that @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be slightly increased by chemical doping.@xcite the london penetration depth and coherence length are reported to be @xmath18  nm and @xmath19  21  nm @xcite and @xmath20  nm @xmath21  0.5  nm.@xcite these values give the ginzburg - landau parameter of @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite , which makes srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 a strong type - ii superconductor .",
    "furthermore , thermodynamic @xcite and tunneling spectroscopy measurements are consistent with a slightly strong - coupling s - wave bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductor with the zero - temperature value of the superconducting gap of @xmath24@xcite , - not far from the weak coupling value of 1.76 .",
    "this superconductor is interesting particularly because of compositional similarity to the newly discovered isostructral fe - and ni - pnictide superconductors with comparable @xmath14 such as kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 , bani@xmath1as@xmath1 , and srni@xmath1p@xmath1 . although there is strong experimental evidence for nodal superconductivity in kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( ref . ) , the ni - based ones have been shown to be fully gapped by thermodynamic and thermal transport measurements.@xcite this naturally prompts the question : what the structure of a superconducting gap is in srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 ? so far , not much work has been done on srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 in this direction . tunneling spectroscopy between 0.17@xmath14 and @xmath14 is consistent with a single , isotropic gap superconductor.@xcite to verify this , however , the thermodynamic , thermal transport , and penetration depth measurements down to much lower temperatures are necessary to provide objective conclusions regarding the gap - symmetry in srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic penetration depth in superconducting state is among most useful probes to explore the superconducting state.@xcite in zero external magnetic field , it is defined by the london penetration depth .",
    "if measured with sufficient accuracy and low enough temperatures , it can be used to understand the angular variation of the superconducting gap on the fermi surface.@xcite in the presence of vortices , the magnetic penetration depth is also influenced by the campbell penetration depth which depends on the elastic properties of vortex lattice and is linked directly to the critical current density.@xcite there has been only limited work performed in the mixed state of srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 @xcite and no studies of the critical current density over the full temperature and field range .    here",
    "we report precision tunnel diode resonator measurements of the magnetic penetration depth , @xmath0 , in single crystals of srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 ( @xmath25 k ) performed in a dilution refrigerator with temperatures down to @xmath26 and in magnetic fields up to 1 t @xmath27 .",
    "the low - temperature variation of the london penetration depth , @xmath28 , clearly indicates exponential saturation , and the analysis of the full - temperature range superfluid density is consistent with a fully gapped superconductor .",
    "the thermodynamic rutgers formula was used to estimate @xmath6 nm which was used to calculate the superfluid density , @xmath7 .",
    "analysis of @xmath8 in the full temperature range shows that it is best described by a single - gap behavior , perhaps with somewhat stronger coupling . the upper critical field , @xmath29  t was determined by the hw theory from the field - sweeps at different temperatures down to 0.02@xmath14 . in finite magnetic fields , @xmath30 , the campbell penetration depth , @xmath31 , shows minimum at an intermediate temperatures ( rather than at the lowest temperature ) which indicates non - monotonic variation of the theoretical critical current ( @xmath9 ) calculated from @xmath31 .",
    "additional diamagnetic response detected above @xmath32 is consistent with surface superconductivity with @xmath33.@xcite",
    "single crystals of srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 were grown using a self - flux method as described in ref .  .",
    "the magnetic penetration depth was measured in a dilution refrigerator by using a tunnel diode resonator ( tdr ) technique ( for review , see ref . ) .",
    "the sample with dimensions ( 0.51@xmath340.70@xmath340.04 ) mm@xmath35 with the shortest direction being along the @xmath36axis was mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into a 2 mm inner diameter copper coil that produces rf excitation field with empty - resonator frequency of 17 mhz with amplitude @xmath37 moe , much smaller than @xmath38 of typical conventional superconductors .",

    "figure  [ fig : lambda ] shows temperature variation of the in - plane london penetration depth , @xmath51 , measured in a single crystal of srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 superconductor which exhibits a very sharp superconducting phase transition at @xmath25 k as shown in the inset , indicating a high quality , homogeneous sample . in the main panel , @xmath51 is shown with temperatures up to about @xmath52 .",
    "the saturation in @xmath5 limit and almost flat temperature dependence , @xmath53 nm , indicate fully gapped superconductivity .",
    "experimental @xmath51 can best fit to a power - law function , @xmath54 , with the exponent of @xmath55 and pre - factor of @xmath56 nm / k@xmath57 .",
    "the fitting curve is shown in red solid line .",
    "a power - law function with such a high exponent has very weak variation at low temperatures , indistinguishable from the exponential behavior which is predicted for a fully open superconducting gap .",
    "in fact , the bcs low - temperature form , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the maximum gap value at @xmath16 , fits the data equally well for @xmath60 where it is expected to be valid . however , the best fitting is achieved with @xmath61 nm and @xmath62 .",
    "the latter is impossible in the single - gap clean limit where @xmath63 is expected .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is also much smaller than the reported value of 566 nm.@xcite similar low - temperatures features can be seen in two - band superconductors such as mgb@xmath1 ( ref . ) , 2h - nbse@xmath1 ( ref . ) , lu@xmath1fe@xmath65si@xmath66 ( ref . ) , and more recently lifeas ( ref . ) . however , as we show below , analysis of the superfluid density in the full temperature range is inconsistent with a two - gap clean behavior . instead , it is more likely that we are dealing with moderate pair - breaking scattering ( maybe due to well - known magnetic impurities in pd ) which results in a finite density of states inside the gap .",
    "we also point out that these temperature variation is very small compared to a known nodal superconductor kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( ref . ) with similar @xmath14 , but exhibiting much stronger temperature dependence of @xmath67 , indicating significant amount of quasiparticles generated at the low temperatures , most likely due to nodes in the gap .    for a metallic sample ,",
    "the measured penetration depth above @xmath14 is determined either by the skin depth @xmath68 or sample size . in case of skin depth limiting , the value of @xmath69 shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] is one half of the actual skin depth.@xcite therefore , we can estimate normal state resistivity from the measurements using @xmath70.@xcite for srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 with @xmath71 mhz and @xmath72 @xmath73 m , the calculated resistivity is approximately 12 @xmath74 cm which is much less than the experimental value of 68 @xmath75 cm ( ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is in a sample - size limited regime . using the same equation ,",
    "the estimated skin depth is 180 nm which is close to half width of the sample .",
    "finally , we note that the data exhibit a smooth transition from superconducting penetration depth to the normal state between @xmath76 and @xmath77 k , which has also been seen in transport measurement.citesung2011 interestingly , @xmath78 k is the onset of superconductivity observed in a polycrystalline sample.@xcite similar feature has also been observed in a related superconductor bani@xmath1as@xmath1.@xcite perhaps this feature requires further study .",

    "while the low - temperature behavior is important , the superconducting gap can be probed at all energy scales by the analysis the superfluid density , @xmath7 , in the entire temperature range.@xcite however , superfluid density requires knowledge of the absolute value of @xmath64 . for srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1",
    "@xmath18 nm was estimated using a dirty limit @xcite and @xmath84 nm was extracted from field - dependent magnetization @xcite within the london approximation and @xmath85 nm was estimated from the measurements of the field of first penetration.@xcite",
    "so , the variation of the literature values is quite significant and we have to resort to another , thermodynamic , approach based on the rutgers formula . in the ginzburg - landau regime ,",

    "it was noted previously that the shape of @xmath8 is rather close to a nonlocal - limiting case , expected in type i superconductors such as aluminum and cadmium.@xcite similar argument was made in the work by t.  k.  kim _ et al . _",

    "<S> the thermodynamic rutgers formula was used to estimate @xmath6 nm which was used to calculate the superfluid density , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of @xmath8 in the full temperature range shows that it is best described by a single - gap behavior , perhaps with somewhat stronger coupling . in a magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> the measured penetration depth is given by the campbell penetration depth which was used to calculate the theoretical critical current density @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath10 t , the strongest pinning is achieved not at the lowest , but at some intermediate temperature , probably due to matching effect between temperature - dependent coherence length and relevant pinning lengthscale . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find a compelling evidence for surface superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> combining all measurements , the entire @xmath11-@xmath12 phase diagram of srpd@xmath1ge@xmath1 is constructed with an estimated @xmath13 t. </S>"
