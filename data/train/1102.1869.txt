    "the discovery of neutrino masses in the neutrinos oscillation experiments necessitates the existance of new interactions called nonstandard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) @xcite .",
    "these new interactions along with the massive neutrinos are predicted by various models @xcite , involving those where neutrinos aquire masses through see - saw mechanism @xcite , those where neutrinos gain masses radiatively due to the presence of extra higgs bosons @xcite and the r - parity violating supersymmetic models @xcite . at low energy",
    "effective level the currrent structure of the nsi is similar to that of four fermi interactions @xcite",
    ". the nsi may be nonuniversal flavor- conserving or flavor - changing contrary to standard model ( sm ) currents which are universal and flavor conserving .",
    "the various methods to constrain the nsi coupling parameters at effective level are extensively studied in the literature @xcite . here ,",
    "we present a novel approach , not only constrianing the nsi parameters , but also computing the absolute values of these parameters . in this approach , we take the low energy flavor conserving @xmath2and @xmath3scattering processes and calculate their total cross sections in terms of nsi coupling parameters ( @xmath4 and @xmath14 ) which appear due to adding the effective four fermion operators for nsi to the electroweak lagrangian . analytically , both cross sections contain terms linear in @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "these terms arise due to the interference effect between various currents ( some are the sm ones and the others are due to nsi ) . these terms in turn lead to two equations linear in @xmath4 and @xmath13 for the corresponding processes . solving the two linear equations similtaneously",
    "we obtain the absolute values of @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "we use the measured values of cross sections for @xmath2and @xmath15scattering processes of lsnd  and rovno experiments , respectively , evaluating the interferences in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath13 and then compare these with corresponding measured values ( for detail see ref .",
    "although the total cross section is directly proportional to the neutrinos energy , but the interference terms are independent of energy because we derive these by taking the ratios of the measured and predicted values of total cross sections . at first stage , we ignore the experimental errors and restrict ourselves to current discrepancy between theory and experiment for the two processes and obtain absolute values of @xmath4 and @xmath13 . at second stage , we incorporate the experimental errors and calculate the upper and lower bounds on @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "the absolute values obtained lie within the range of these bounds .",
    "our analysis is based on two assumptions@xmath16 @xmath17as in sm , where two coupling constants g@xmath18 and g@xmath19 are same both for @xmath2and @xmath3scattering processes , similarly nsi coupling parameters @xmath4 and @xmath13 are also assumed to be same for both the processes .",
    "@xmath20 we take only the flavor conserving @xmath2and @xmath3scattering processes and ignore the flavor violating processes .",
    "this is because the interference effect , which is core of our discussion , could only occur in the flavor conserving process ( for detail see ref .",
    "the most general form of the effective four - fermion interaction lagrangian for low energy @xmath21 process in the presence of nsi is given by @xcite , @xmath22[\\bar { f}\\gamma^{\\mu}pf^{^{\\prime}}]-2\\sqrt{2}\\underset{p , f,\\alpha}{{\\displaystyle\\sum } } g_{p}^{f}g_{f}\\ [ \\bar{\\nu}_{\\alpha}\\gamma_{\\mu}l\\nu_{\\alpha}][\\bar{f}\\gamma^{\\mu}pf\\ ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\underset{\\alpha,\\beta}{{\\displaystyle\\sum } } \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}^{fp}2\\sqrt{2}g_{f}[\\bar{\\nu}_{\\alpha}\\gamma_{\\mu}l\\nu_{\\beta}][\\bar{f}\\gamma^{\\mu}pf]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first and second terms are the sm operators and the third one is the nsi four fermion operator , @xmath23 with @xmath24  as the fermi constant , @xmath25 is any lepton or quark and @xmath26 is its su(2 ) partner , @xmath27are the neutral current coupling constants in the sm and @xmath28are the nonstandard flavor conserving * *  * * @xmath29  and flavor changing  @xmath30effective coupling parameters .",
