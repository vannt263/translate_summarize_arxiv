    "<S> this study introduces a procedure to obtain general expressions , @xmath0 , subject to linear constraints on the function and its derivatives defined at specified values . </S>",
    "<S> these _ constrained expressions _ can be used describe functions with embedded specific constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the paper first shows how to express the most general explicit function passing through a single point in three distinct ways : linear , additive , and rational . </S>",
    "<S> then , functions with constraints on single , two , or multiple points are introduced as well as those satisfying relative constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this capability allows to obtain general expressions to solve linear differential equations with no need to satisfy constraints ( the `` subject to : '' conditions ) as the constraints are already embedded in the _ constrained expression_. in particular , for expressions passing through a set of points , a generalization of the waring s interpolation form , is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the general form of additive _ constrained expressions _ is introduced as well as a procedure to derive its coefficient functions , requiring the inversion of a matrix with dimensions as the number of constraints . </S>"
