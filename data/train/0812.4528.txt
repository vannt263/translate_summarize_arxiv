    "the kozai instability is a well - known destabilizing mechanism of high inclination satellites . arnold ( 1990 ) , in his book _ huygens & barrow , newton & hooke _ , reports a neat illustration due to lidov ( 1963 ) .",
    "lidov discovered that if the orbit of the moon is turned through @xmath0 , its eccentricity increases so rapidly under the action of the tidal forces of the sun that it collides with the earth in four years ! the effect was described and analysed by kozai ( 1962 , 1980 ) in his studies of the survival of high inclination comets and asteroids .",
    "the kozai mechanism is a secular effect whereby , above a critical inclination @xmath1 of around @xmath2 ( depending on the system ) , the inclination @xmath3 is coupled to eccentricity @xmath4 though the kozai constant  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath5 and is driven to vary in cycles between its initial value and the critical value . the argument of pericentre also librates about @xmath6 @xcite . in other words , nearly circular ,",
    "high inclination orbits are driven to high eccentricities in exchange for lower inclination , so that in the solar system this produces the population of sun - grazing comets ( e.g. , stagg & bailey 1989 ) .    at first glance",
    ", this suggests that planets or asteroids in high inclination orbits in multistellar systems can not survive for long times .",
    "a planet in a circumstellar orbit in a binary star system is known to be subject to kozai cycles on a timescale @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the period of the binary , @xmath9 that of the planet , @xmath10 is the binary s eccentricity , @xmath11 and @xmath12 the stellar masses and @xmath13 the planet s mass .",
    "surprisingly , then , a recent study of planetesimals in the stellar system of hd 98800  @xcite found a long - lived , high inclination circumbinary population .",
    "hd 98800 has four stars , in two close binaries a and b , in highly inclined and eccentric orbits and hosts a circumbinary debris disc around the b binary pair . the system is well approximated as a hierarchical triple star system , as the secondary star in the a binary is fairly small and in a close orbit .",
    "high inclination particles are found to be in long - term stable orbits inclined by @xmath14 to @xmath15 to the inner binary b. this is well above the critical inclination relative to both stellar orbits , yet the orbits are not undergoing kozai cycles .",
    "it is known that the kozai effect can be disrupted if another mechanism , such as general relativity , tidal forces or other interactions between planets , causes orbital precession on a shorter timescale @xcite .",
    "however , the simulations in @xcite deal with the newtonian dynamics of test particles , so the only additional factor present is the mutual gravitational perturbations of the stars .",
    "this paper explains the origin of the surprising stability .",
    "the inner binary causes a nodal precession , instead of kozai cycles .",
    "this stabilises the test particles against any kozai instability driven by the outer star .",
    "we first present the evidence in favour of this explanation in section  [ sec : numexpt ] , and then provide a more detailed study of the nodal precession , together with the dynamics behind it , in section  [ sec : analytic ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .    .",
    "[ tab : orbit ] the initial orbital parameters for the simulations of system hd 98800 used in @xcite .",
    "these are the orbital elements used to evolve the system from 1 myr in the past to the present state , so the starting parameters for the inner binary are also different for each wide orbit case .",
    "the longitudes given are relative to the arbitrary reference direction of the simulations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         we now carry out the same calculation for sets of test particles in general binary systems .",
    "this empirical model can then be used in conjunction with the outer star s kozai timescale to place limits on the high inclination stability in a general hierarchical triple system .",
    "simulations show that the libration islands decrease in size as the eccentricity decreases , whilst the critical inclination for the librations to occur increases .",
    "the mass ratio of the binary , @xmath16 , also has an effect , but not on the geometry of the libration islands . instead , as this ratio decreases from 0.5 , the particles start to escape from the simple libration patterns previously seen . to derive our empirical fit , sets of simulations are again run with similar test particle grids , but now with only one inclination of @xmath17 to find the longest possible period of variations .",
    "the stellar mass ratio is varied from 0.1 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1 and the eccentricity from 0.1 to 0.8 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "the binary was generalised to a separation of 1 au , total mass 1 @xmath18 and with all longitudes equal to zero .",
    "the parameters to the power law were found to fit @xmath19 this is expected to scale with semimajor axis , as seen in the coplanar limits in @xcite . to derive this empirical formula ,",
    "the powers of @xmath4 and @xmath20 have been fixed at the values shown in the fitting .",
    "the amplitude has been fitted ( excluding the @xmath21 case , which seems poorly modelled by this formula , most likely as it is approaching the constant inclination regime ) , but has an associated error of 0.01 .",
    "despite this the equation provides a good fit to the data and a low @xmath22 value , as shown in figure  [ fig : hdemu ] .",
    "this paper presents a foray into an area of dynamics that has not been extensively studied , namely small particles around a highly eccentric binary star in a hierarchical triple system . at outset",
    ", such particles might be expected to be disrupted by the kozai instability .    here , we have demonstrated the existence of stable , high inclination circumbinary test particles .",
    "they owe their stability to the high eccentricity of the inner binary .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , as it goes against every expectation of planetary dynamics .",
    "the inner binary , instead of inducing kozai cycles , causes smooth inclination variations and nodal precession for certain initial longitudes .",
    "this suppresses kozai cycles that would otherwise occur due to the outer star in the hierarchical triple .",
    "an analytical theory to explain these variations is desirable .",
    "however , the stars are very eccentric , their mass ratio is high , and the test particle s inclination is also large , leaving no obvious small parameters for the standard perturbation expansions of celestial mechanics .",
    "the semimajor axis ratios are not very small , but do not explain why existing secular theories ( e.g. @xcite ) are unable to describe the dynamics .",
    "the libration islands , inclination variations and critical initial inclination are surprisingly familiar to , but contrasting with , the dynamics of the kozai mechanism .",
    "the kozai mechanism occurs if @xmath23 , whereas the nodal libration appears to be a similar process occurring when @xmath24 .",
    "there exists an approximate integral of motion  namely , the test particle s component of angular momentum along the direction of the line of apses of the binary star s orbit .",
    "this also is analogous to the kozai mechanism , which has an approximate integral of motion .",
    "the high inclination libration feature may have important consequences for planetary stability in circumbinary orbits .",
    "many stellar members of triples have exchanged into the system , so high mutual planet - star inclinations are very likely .",
    "if there are regions of stability then the outlook for planetary systems in these environments is more promising than previously thought .",
