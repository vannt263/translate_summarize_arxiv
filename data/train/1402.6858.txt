    "spectral density is a fundamental and one of the simplest characteristics of quantum systems . in general ,",
    "spectral density is system dependent .",
    "nevertheless , there exist a few universal densities which appear in numerous different models in the limit of large number degrees of freedom .",
    "probably the best known example of such universality is the wigner semicircle law @xcite-@xcite @xmath2 here @xmath0 is the matrix dimension and @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "the semicircle law is well investigated in mathematics .",
    "initially it appears as limiting spectral density of random matrices with independent elements @xcite but later it was proved that it describes densities of a large variety of random matrix ensembles ( e.g. in free probability @xcite ) . in physics its importance is limited as there is practically no physical models with such density .    instead",
    ", there exist models whose spectral density is well described by a different universal law , namely by the gaussian function @xmath4 a typical and the most investigated example is the shell model with @xmath0 fermions with two - body interaction occupying @xmath5 one - particle states with @xmath6 @xcite-@xcite but one can argue that the gaussian density is universal behaviour ( under certain conditions ) for any @xmath0-body model with short - range interaction .",
    "we stress that the both formulae and ( with corresponding rescaling ) are valid only in the bulk , namely when energy is scaled as follows @xmath7 with fixed @xmath8 and @xmath1 .    for larger energies",
    "( e.g. @xmath9 ) and , in particular close to the ground state , the spectral densities have a different forms , usually exponential or stretched exponential .",
    "for example , for standard gaussian ensembles of random matrices at the left of zero point of the semicircle law , @xmath10 , the density for @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 $ ] @xcite .",
    "for the shell model with equally spaced one - particle states , the density close to the ground state @xmath13 increases as follows : @xmath14 $ ] @xcite , @xcite .",
    "though there exist many physical models with the gaussian density , this subject is not well investigated due to the fact that in solid state physics the number of particles is so large that the behaviour of the density in the bulk very far from the ground state is meaningless .",
    "recently the situation has changed .",
    "first , modern experiments can be performed with a small number of particles .",
    "second , progress in numerical calculations permits to obtain the full solution of quantum models with a few tenths of particles ( but not much more ) .",
    "consequently , the investigation of such models at large but finite values of @xmath0 becomes of interest .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss in detail spectral densities of one - dimensional spin chains . as a typical example we consider the quantum spin-@xmath15 ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields",
    "whose hamiltonian is @xmath16 where @xmath17 are usual pauli matrices .",
    "parameter @xmath18 determines the strength of the transverse field and parameter @xmath19 fixes the longitudinal field .",
    "we refer to @xmath18 and @xmath19 as coupling constants . for simplicity",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the purpose of the paper is twofold .",
    "first we confirm that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 the spectral densities of the ising model when all coupling constants are of the order of unity attain the gaussian form even at relatively small number of spins @xmath0 .",
    "second , we discuss different types of corrections at large but finite @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest is power series corrections to in close analogy with usual corrections to the central limit theorem .",
    "the second kind of corrections is more drastic as it manifests as pronounced peaks in the spectral density .",
    "these peaks are related with strong degeneracies of eigenvalues in certain limits of coupling constants .",
    "though this phenomenon leads to spectral densities quite different from the smooth gaussian shape prediction  , it seems that it has not been discussed in detail in the literature .",
    "the investigation of such corrections constitutes the main part of the paper .",
    "we develop a simple method which permits to obtain approximate formulae describing well multi - peaks spectral densities in good agreement with numerical calculations for different values of coupling constants . limiting densities are represented as a sum of different gaussian functions ( multi - gaussians ) whose parameters are calculated analytically from the hamiltonian without the full solution of the problem .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ integrable ] the ising model in transverse field ( with @xmath20 ) is considered . as its spectrum",
    "is known , all calculations are straightforward and can be performed analytically . in section  [",
    "two_fields ] the non - integrable case of the ising model in two fields is discussed .",
    "similar to the integrable case we demonstrate the existence of gaussian and multi - gaussian regimes for this model .",
    "the calculations are slightly different for large values of coupling constants and for small values of @xmath18 .",
    "the summary of results is given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "details of calculations are presented in appendices .",
    "the quantum ising model in transverse field @xcite is one of the most investigated one - dimensional spin-@xmath15 models . in particular",
    ", it serves as the standard model of quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "this model is determined by the hamiltonian with @xmath20 @xmath21 the quantum ising model in transverse field is integrable and its spectrum are calculated explicitly by the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the result corresponds to the fermionic filling of one - particle levels @xmath22 where @xmath23 are number of fermions in state @xmath24 , @xmath25 with @xmath26 and phase @xmath27 equals @xmath28 with integer momenta @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath30 the spectrum consists of two sub - spectra with only even number of excitations , @xmath31 even integer , but with the both even and odd momenta , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 . for @xmath35",

    "there exists one zero mode and the both expressions give the same result . for completeness , in [ ap_0 ] the derivation of this result is briefly reminded .",

    "the dominant contribution is given by vicinity of point @xmath63 and @xmath64 this is exactly the gaussian prediction for the rescaled variable @xmath41 .",
    "as the true energy is the sum of individual ones ( cf . ) , it is plain that in this case the origin of the gaussian behaviour for the spectral density is the same as in the usual central limit theorem .",
    "indeed , the quantity @xmath65 can be considered as the sum of @xmath0 random variables @xmath23 ( or equivalently as a realization of a random walk ) and the central limit theorem states that probability distribution of @xmath66 is the gaussian with parameters determined by the first and the second moments of @xmath66 which gives .",
    "of course , the same result can be obtained directly from the hamiltonian without reference to the exact solution .",
    "it is sufficient to calculate the first traces of powers of the hamiltonian .",
    "denote @xmath67 simple calculations give that for ising model in the transverse field @xmath68 often the gaussian approximation is practically indistinguishable in the bulk from the exact saddle point formula .",
    "for example , in figure  [ difference ] the both expressions are present and it is clear that the difference is hardly visible .",

    "the exact asymptotic spectral density for the ising model in transverse field and its gaussian approximation are valid in the limit when the number of spins tends to infinity , @xmath1 . nevertheless for large but finite values of @xmath0 the situation may and often will be different .",
    "for example , in figure  [ ising_less_1 ] and [ ising_greater_1 ] we present the results of numerical calculations for the spectral density at different values of coupling constants . notice that the density has clear peaks which are not described by the above asymptotic formulae .",

    "calculations are straightforward but the results are tedious , not transparent , and we shall not present them here .",
    "we found that for our purposes the gaussian approximation is sufficient . to settle it",
    ", one has to calculate the lowest moments of the ising hamiltonian in a sub - space with fixed @xmath77 .",

    "the direct calculations lead to the following results @xmath85 and @xmath86 it means that the mean density of states with fixed @xmath77 corresponding to each individual peak can well be approximated by the gaussian @xmath87 and the total mean density is the sum over all allowed @xmath77 .",
    "the limiting values of @xmath88 and of @xmath89 are the following : @xmath90    taking into account different counting for different @xmath18 one gets the following multi - gaussian formulae for the spectral density for the ising model in transverse field at large but finite @xmath0 .    for @xmath35 @xmath91    for @xmath30 @xmath92 figures  [ ising_less_1]-[ising_greater_1 ] demonstrate that these simple formulae are in a good agreement with numerical results for different coupling constants .",
    "the domain of visibility of peaks in the spectral density can roughly be estimated from the condition @xmath93 in the center of the spectrum , @xmath94 and the above formulae show that the peaks will be observable provided the number of spins , @xmath95 where @xmath96 for @xmath97 peaks will be strongly overlapped and the descriprion by simple gaussian formula becomes adequate .",
    "the ising model in the transverse field is integrable but when a second longitudinal field is added , the resulting model whose hamiltonian is given by is not integrable ( but see @xcite for low lying states ) .",
    "recently certain properties of such model have been investigated experimentally @xcite .",
    "eigenvalues of this problem can not be calculated analytically and its spectral statistics is well described by the standard goe distribution @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this model belongs to the class of translational invariant systems with short - range interactions .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that for such problems the free energy , energy , and entropy are extensive functions of the number of spins ( physically it means that the surface energy for short - range interaction systems is much smaller that the volume energy ) . in particular , the full entropy of @xmath0-spins , @xmath98 which determines the full spectral density according to the formula @xmath99 has the following form ( in weak sense , in general , ) @xmath100 it is also well known ( and can be proved e.g. by calulating moments by saddle point method ) that the @xmath0-th power of any convex function @xmath101 when @xmath1 can be approximated in the bulk by the gaussian centered at the point of maximum , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) @xmath104 combining these two statements together leads to the known conclusion that the spectral density of many - body systems with short - range interactions should be well described in the bulk by the gaussian approximation which is fixed by the knowledge of only two lowest momenta of the hamiltonian . for random spin systems ,",
    "similar result has been proved in @xcite by a different method .",
    "the first moments of the hamiltotian ( as in ) can be calculated straightforwardly .",

    "notice that the convergence of the spectral density to the pure gaussian form is slow .",
    "the first correction term is of the order of @xmath109 where @xmath0 is the number of spins .",

    "there exist general arguments explaining why the density of states for @xmath0-body short - range interaction models should be well approximated asymptotically in the bulk by the gaussian function ( see ) .",
    "however , the numerical calculations for large but finite @xmath0 clearly demonstrate that it is not always the case ( see figure  [ multi_density ] ) .",

    "the remaining hamiltonian is the sum of nearest - neighbour interaction terms @xmath116 after the rotation to new spins it takes the form @xmath117 the standard way of splitting the degeneracies consists in the diagonalization of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath118 in the sub - space of all states with the same energy ( which in our case corresponds to the fixed number of spin up ) .",
    "due to exponentially large dimension of such sub - space for the ising model considered here , this direct approach is not effective .",
    "we propose a different method .",
    "as the initial hamiltonian belongs to the class of short - range interaction , the hamiltonian projected to the sub - space of states with fixed number of spins up will , necessarily also contain only short - range interactions . as it was done above",
    ", one can argue that the spectral density of such projected hamiltonian is well described by the first two moments of this hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation of these momenta is performed in [ ap_1 ] and the results are @xmath119 it means that the normalised density of states with fixed number of spins up is the gaussian with the above parameters @xmath120 and the total spectral density is the sum over all @xmath77 @xmath121 figure  [ multi_density ] shows that this formula agrees well with results of numerical calculations for different values of @xmath18 .    in [ a p_3 ] it is demonstrated that for the ising model in two fileds the hamiltonian projected on the sub - space with fixed number of spins up reduces to the well known xx model which has an exact solution .",
    "the spectrum of the xx model corresponds to the fermionic filling as in .",
    "therefore , in the bulk the xx spectral density can be well approximated by the gaussian function whose parameters agree with .",
    "it gives a direct proof that in sub - space of fixed unperturbed energy ( i.e. fixed @xmath77 ) spectral density is gaussian .",
    "the criterium implies that peaks in strong fields are visible if @xmath122 where @xmath123      another interesting limit of the ising model in two fields is when @xmath19 is fixed and @xmath124 . to investigate this case",
    "it is convenient first to diagonalize the one - spin part as it is done in and .",
    "in particular , the diagonal energy in the new @xmath125-spin representation is @xmath126 here as above @xmath77 is the total number of spins up and @xmath127 is the number of groups of spins in the same directions ( cf .",
    "figure  [ structure ] ) .",
    "when @xmath128 the unperturbed energy takes the form @xmath129 we assume that parameter @xmath19 is of order of @xmath69 , therefore this energy is a function of two integers , @xmath77 and @xmath127 .",
    "the existence of strong peaks in the spectral density depends crucially on exact degeneracies of this energy .",
    "we consider first a characteristic example with integer @xmath130 . in this case , unperturbed energy is simply an even integer , @xmath131 where @xmath132 it means that the sub - space of exactly degenerated states consists of all combinations of spins up and down such that integer @xmath133 takes a constant value . from",

    "though for very large number of spins these peaks disappear , for number of spins accessible in today numerical calculations and reasonable coupling constants the density does contain clear peaks .",
    "for example , in figure  [ 64 ] we present predictions for spectral densities of the ising model with @xmath178 spins which is far beyond dimensions reachable in direct diagonalization .",
    "it is clearly seen that density is not a smooth gaussian - type function but , instead , contains numerous identifiable peaks .    despite the fact that we consider only the ising model in two fields our results should be valid for a large class of models with local interactions e.g. the bose - habbard model where spectral density also have pronounced peaks at certain limits of coupling constant @xcite . in general , peaks in spectral densities may and will influence many physical ( and statistical ) properties of models considered . in particular",
    ", they may alter deduction of large @xmath0 behaviour from finite @xmath0 calculations .",
    "we think that further investigation of such mesodynamics ( as opposite to thermodynamics ) phenomena are of importance .     + ( a )     + ( b )    the authors are grateful to guillaume roux for numerous discussions and for pointing out ref .",
    "yya is supported by the cfm foundation .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to discuss in detail the construction of energy levels @xmath179 for the ising model in transverse field ( [ h_ising ] ) with finite value of the number of spins @xmath0 .",
    "this construction is rarely discussed in literature mostly due to the interest in the thermodynamic limit @xmath180 .",
    "as it is well known , the ising model in transverse field is integrable by the jordan - wigner transformation which maps the spin system into a quadratic fermion problem ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath181 here @xmath182 and @xmath183 are fermionic annihilation and creation operators ( spin up corresponds to the absence of fermion ) .",
    "when one imposes periodic boundary conditions for spin operators ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) , boundary conditions for fermions have to be fixed as follows @xmath186 where @xmath187 is conserved spin - parity operator @xmath188 and @xmath189 is the total number of @xmath160-fermions @xmath190 to diagonalize the resulting fermionic hamiltonian one has first to perform the fourier transform of @xmath182 , i.e. introduce new fermionic operators , @xmath191 @xmath192 from boundary conditions it follows that values of @xmath127 have to be quantized , @xmath193 notice that @xmath194 .",
    "after such fourier transform the ising hamiltonian takes the form @xmath195 the last step consists in performing a bogoliubov transformation which mixed @xmath191 and @xmath196 operators ( @xmath197 ) @xmath198 in terms of these @xmath199 operators the hamiltonian is diagonalized , @xmath200 and @xmath201 are determined in .",
    "the spectrum of the ising chain is obtained by adding excitations with different impulsions to the ground state energy @xmath202 as the parity is an integral of motion , the number of excitations added has to be choosen carefully in order to fulfill the condition ( [ parity_number_op_relation ] ) .",
    "anti - periodic boundary conditions mean that momenta of excitations are proportional to odd integers ( see ) . from the above discussion it follows that the spin - parity @xmath203 .",
    "then for anti - periodic boundary conditions the total number of excitations has to be even .    by definition , the bogoliubov vacuum , @xmath204 ,",
    "is given by the condition that @xmath205 .",
    "as @xmath206 for all these allowed values of @xmath127 , the bogoliubov vacuum in terms of @xmath161 operators has the form @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the @xmath161 vacuum , i.e @xmath209 .",
    "therefore @xmath210 is composed with an even number of @xmath161 particles created by pairs @xmath211 of opposite non - zero momenta .",
    "consequently , in order to fulfil the relation ( [ parity_number_op_relation ] ) one has to consider addition of all combination of even number of excitations to @xmath212 to reconstruct half of the eigen - energies .",
    "the other half comes from the sector of parity @xmath213 which corresponds to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "excitations momenta are now given by even integers as in and the total number of excitations has to be odd ( for even @xmath0 ) .    in this sub - space @xmath214 for @xmath215 and @xmath216 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath217 and @xmath218 ( for even @xmath0 ) .",
    "hamiltonian is diagonal for @xmath161 fermions with these two values of @xmath127 and their energies are @xmath219 therefore , the bogoliubov transformation has to be performed only over all other values of momenta .",
    "if @xmath79 , the number of excitations of momenta @xmath58 and @xmath216 have to be zero in the lowest energy state and the bogoliubov vacuum is @xmath220 this vacuum contains even number of @xmath161 particles and only odd number of excitations ( i.e. vacuum energy itself is not in the spectrum ) is allowed .",
    "if @xmath221 , energy of the excitation with momentum @xmath58 is negative , therefore it should not be included in the ground state ( with @xmath222 ) .",
    "the vacuum now has the form @xmath223 such vacuum contains odd number of @xmath161 fermions and one can add only even number of excitations .    finally , for positive spin parity one has to add odd number of excitations when @xmath35 and even number of excitations when @xmath30 .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the ising model in two fields is by construction the sum of two hamiltonians @xmath224 where @xmath145 is determined by and @xmath225 by .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the first and the second moments of this hamiltonian in the sub - space of states with fixed number of spins up .",
    "the total number of such states is @xmath81 where @xmath77 is the number of spins up .",
    "any of such states can be represented as a sequence of @xmath127 groups with @xmath226 spins up followed by @xmath227 spins down ( see figure  [ structure ] ) .",
    "we indicate such state by @xmath228 .",
    "notice that there exist many states with fixed values of @xmath77 and @xmath127 .     and",
    "red arrow down indicate spins with @xmath229 . ]    by construction all @xmath226 and @xmath227 are bigger or equal to @xmath69 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and their sum is fixed @xmath232 hamiltonian @xmath145 is diagonal in this basis and in @xmath225 ( see ) only the term @xmath233 gives non - zero contribution to the first moment since other terms flip spins . therefore in any state with fixed @xmath77 and @xmath127 @xmath234 where @xmath38 is as in and @xmath235 denotes @xmath236 .    the next step is to calculate the variance in the subspace with fixed @xmath77 .",
    "it means that in the intermediate states ( i.e. in @xmath237 ) one has to take into account only those states @xmath238 which have exactly the same number @xmath77 of spins up as in @xmath239 . by examining @xmath225",
    "it appears that only the term @xmath240 may conserve @xmath77 .",
    "it is evident that only the flipping of boundary spins separating blocks of spins down and up does not change energy .",
    "the number of such transition is @xmath241 where @xmath127 is the number of groups of spins in the same directions .",
    "therefore , @xmath242 the last step consists in finding the number of states with fixed values of @xmath77 and @xmath127 which we denote by @xmath143 .",
    "it can be calculated as follows .",
    "the number of cases when @xmath243 and @xmath230 are well known ( and can easily be obtained for instance by a generating function method ) @xmath244 the same is true for @xmath227 @xmath245 total number of possibilities is the product of these two expressions .",
    "but it corresponds to a fixed initial point .",
    "summing over all points is equivalent to multiplication by @xmath0 . doing this",
    "we get cyclic permuted configurations @xmath127 times , therefore , the result has to be divided by @xmath127 .",
    "it gives @xmath246 this formula is valid provided @xmath247 .",
    "there is two cases with @xmath215 .",
    "one with @xmath248 when all spins are up and one with @xmath249 when all spins are down .",
    "when one uses this formula for calculating the sum over all @xmath127 of a polynomial of @xmath127 the constant term gives @xmath81 which is the correct answer for @xmath249 and @xmath248 .",
    "other terms are powers of @xmath127 and are absent when @xmath215",
    ". therefore one can sum over @xmath127 from 1 to @xmath77 and then sum over all @xmath77 from @xmath58 to @xmath0 .",
    "the above formulae has been calculated for states with fixed value of @xmath77 and @xmath127 .",
    "but the unperturbed energy depends only on @xmath77 , so to get the first two moments of the hamiltonian in the sub - space of fixed @xmath77 one has to sum over all possible @xmath127 @xmath250 using the relations @xmath251 one finds that the first moment of the ising hamiltonian and its variance calculated in the sub - space with @xmath77 spins up are @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the mean value of @xmath127 over states with fixed @xmath77 @xmath254",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model in two fields contains terms of different nature .",
    "there exists a part of this hamiltonian which does not change the total number of spins up , @xmath77 , and the rest which changes this number .",
    "when we are interested in the splitting of initially degenerated levels , these two parts act differently .",
    "the latter can be taken into account in the usual perturbation series as it has been done in [ ap_2 ] .",
    "the principal problem is the @xmath77 conserving part as no simple perturbation expansion is possible .",
    "the standard approach is to diagonalise this part to find correct energies and eigenfunctions in the zeroth order .",
    "what we did is to avoid the direct diagonalisation .",
    "our main point is that , though we do not know in general how eigenvalues split exactly , we do know the first and the second moment of @xmath77-conserving hamiltonian and as has been discussed in previous sections the distribution of eigenvalues of projected hamiltonian has to be close to the gaussian function . to check it",
    "analytically it is necessary to calculate high moments of this projected hamiltonian in the limit @xmath1 and see if they correspond to the gaussain values .",
    "we are unaware of direct combinatorial proof of this statement .",
    "but for the ising model in two fields it can be done by using the xx - model . indeed , for the ising model the projected hamiltonian in the leading order has the form ( cf . and )",
    "@xmath255_n \\label{n_conserving_h}\\ ] ] where @xmath256_n$ ] denotes the @xmath77-conserving part of the corresponding expression .",

    "it conserves the total @xmath125-spin and can be solved by the wigner - jordan transformation .",
    "the resulting energies are @xmath259 where for @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath23 .",
    "of course , one has to fix the total number of excitations , @xmath262    the discussion can be performed as above and using and one concludes that , indeed , the moments of the hamiltonian are gaussian with the first moment @xmath263 and the variance @xmath264 which are the same as what we have used above .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath157 given by induces transitions with @xmath167 , @xmath265 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "direct inspections show that there exist 3 possible type of transitions which do not change energy .",
    "they correspond to ( a ) @xmath165 and @xmath166 , ( b ) @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and ( c ) @xmath167 and @xmath155 .",
    "these possibilities are schematically indicated in figure  [ alpha_1_spin_exchange ] .",

    "consider partitions when there exist exactly @xmath269 groups of nearby two spins , @xmath266 up and all other groups have either @xmath270 or @xmath271 .",
