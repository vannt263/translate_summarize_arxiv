  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we show that bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices with broken time - reversal symmetry can support chiral edge modes originating from nontrivial bulk excitation band topology . to be specific , we analyze a bose - hubbard extension of the haldane model , which can be realized with recently developed techniques of manipulating honeycomb optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the topological properties of bloch bands known for the noninteracting case are smoothly carried over to bogoliubov excitation bands for the interacting case . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the parameter ranges that display topological bands enlarge with increasing the hubbard interaction or the particle density . in the presence of sharp boundaries , </S>",
    "<S> chiral edge modes appear in the gap between topological excitation bands . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that by coherently transferring a portion of a condensate into an edge mode , a density wave is formed along the edge owing to an interference with the background condensate . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a unique method of detecting an edge mode through a macroscopic quantum phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : bose - einstein condensation , bose - hubbard model , band topology , chiral edge state </S>"
