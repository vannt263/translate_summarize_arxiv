    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are indeed gamma - ray bursts since their spectrum is dominated by gamma radiation .",
    "@xmath0 is the characteristic photon energy measured from a burst spectrum by fitting a smoothly broken power law ( band et al . 1993 ) . @xcite",
    "have measured @xmath0 values for 399 batse bursts .",
    "they find that a histogram of @xmath0 is roughly log - normal in shape , with average values of @xmath16 .",
    "they also find that the width of this distribution is surprisingly narrow , with a dispersion corresponding to a factor of @xmath17 about the average .",
    "@xcite have proven that the narrowness of this distribution is not an artifact of batse detector properties or of the analysis procedures , and in particular that the sharp falloff in frequency down to at least 50 kev is certain .",
    "further , deep searches with the solar maximum mission gamma ray spectrometer have proven that the population of high-@xmath0 bursts is nearly zero @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that gev bursts and kev bursts do not exist .",
    "for example , grb950425 is certainly a gev burst @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite and @xcite report x - ray transients that have similar light curves and durations as classical grbs . the existence of these x - ray transients might be interpreted as implying that the @xmath0 distribution has a broad tail to low energies , despite the iron - clad data from batse .",
    "the resolution lies in the realization that the x - ray transients all have peak fluxes ( in the 50 - 300 kev band ) that are far below the normal batse trigger threshold .",
    "the result from @xcite is that the @xmath0 distribution is narrow _ for bursts in a small range of peak flux_. bursts with peak fluxes far below the batse threshold do not ( and should not ) enter into the histograms constructed from batse triggers . if an @xmath0 distribution is constructed for very low peak flux events ( including the x - ray transients ) , then a simple extrapolation of the average @xmath0 versus peak flux relation of mallozzi suggests that such events will appear as ordinary bursts except with @xmath18 kev , just as observed .",
    "so apparently there is something about grbs ( the @xmath0 value ) that is fairly constant over all bursts .",
    "this poses a double challenge to theory , since there must be some physical mechanism which acts as a thermostat and there must be some mechanism for balancing the kinematic blue shifts ( due to the jet s velocity towards earth ) and red shifts ( due to the cosmological expansion ) .",
    "based on the factor of @xmath19 variation in burst luminosity , the lorentz factor of the jet likely varies by a large factor , while the cosmological red shift varies by over a factor of 3 ; so we might expect the kinematic effects to produce a broad @xmath0 distribution even if all bursts had the same rest frame temperature .",
    "@xcite also found that the average @xmath0 value varied systematically with the apparent brightness of the burst .",
    "the peak flux used here , @xmath11 , is measured over a 256 ms time scale within a limited energy band from 50 - 300 kev @xcite .",
    "the bright batse bursts have @xmath20 around 339 kev while the faintest batse bursts have @xmath20 around 175 kev .",
    "the trivial explanation of this effect as arising only from cosmological red shifts is unreasonable since burst peak fluxes vary more due to the wide spread in luminosity than due to distances .",
    "so a second mystery is why @xmath21 varies with @xmath11 as observed .",
    "two kinematic effects will change the characteristic photon energy of the emitting region in its own rest frame , @xmath3 , into the characteristic photon energy as seen by earth , @xmath0 .",
    "the first is the blue shift caused by the bulk velocity of the emitting region towards earth .",
    "this will increase the detected characteristic energy by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "the second is the red shift caused by the usual cosmological expansion of the universe .",
    "this will decrease the detected characteristic energy by a factor of @xmath22 , where @xmath10 is the red shift .",
    "so , @xmath23 here , the @xmath0 distribution will be a convolution of the @xmath3 distribution and the kinematic smearing effects from the @xmath24 factor .",
    "the @xmath3 value can vary from pulse - to - pulse and burst - to - burst . in general",
    ", @xmath3 might have a power law dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "so @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the power law index .",
    "the exponent @xmath26 might be zero if there is some process which limits the temperature in the emitting region , or @xmath26 might be unity if the kinetic energy of the jet is entirely converted to thermal energy and then into gamma radiation .    within generic internal shock scenarios ,",
    "the burst isotropic luminosity , @xmath4 , varies as some power of @xmath1 .",
    "one power of @xmath1 comes from the available energy in the shell .",
    "two more powers of @xmath1 come from the blue shifting of photons in the usual @xmath27 burst spectrum .",
    "( the 50 - 300 kev power law index varies over a typical range of about unity in width from burst - to - burst , with an average of close to -2 as shown in fig . 4 of schaefer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fig .",
    "46 of schaefer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . )",
    "the bunching of photons by the forward motion of the shell will not increase the luminosity since the overall timing of sub - pulses ( and thus the distribution of photons within the peak ) is determined by the central engine which has no @xmath1 dependence .",
    "( alternatively , if a single sub - pulse with observed duration longer than 256 ms dominates the peak flux , then an additional @xmath28 dependence is due to the bunching of photons . )",
    "hence , the luminosity should vary as something like @xmath29 .",
    "however , variations on this basic scenario are possible ; for example the peak luminosity might well be dominated by a relatively small emission area ( to account for the fact that most bursts have millisecond variations @xcite ) and the resulting relativistic beaming could provide another factor of @xmath28 .",
    "emission efficiencies could well have some dependency on @xmath1 . to allow for any reasonable scenario ,",
    "let me adopt a general expression of @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the power law index that is expected to be @xmath32 or perhaps @xmath33 and to vary somewhat from burst - to - burst .",
    "equations 1 - 3 can be combined as @xmath34 the kinematic part can be isolated as @xmath35 this representation is convenient since @xmath4 and @xmath10 can be measured for many bursts , either by direct measures of their optical red shifts or based on the lag and variability distance indicators @xcite .",
    "this is also convenient since lines of constant @xmath11 are also functions of @xmath4 and @xmath10 , and the narrow @xmath0 distributions of @xcite were constructed for bursts in narrow bins of @xmath11 .",
    "figure 1 displays curves of constant @xmath0 ( for the case of @xmath36 ) and lines of constant @xmath11 .",
    "the two @xmath11 lines are for values ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) which are the medians of mallozzi s brightest and dimmest bins ( for @xmath39 ) .",
    "the two curves of constant @xmath0 values ( 339 and 175 kev ) were chosen to correspond to the measured values for mallozzi s brightest and dimmest bins ( for @xmath40 and @xmath41 normalized so that the lower curve is close to the faintest @xmath11 line ) .    over the range for which grbs are seen ( typically @xmath42 ) , the @xmath0 curves are fairly close to the @xmath11 lines .",
    "this is to say that for a collection of bursts within a narrow @xmath11 bin , the kinematic shifts do not vary much . over a wide range of @xmath4 or @xmath10 ,",
    "the overall shifting of @xmath3 is roughly constant .",
    "this constancy is an essential compensation between the red and blue shifts , in that bursts with low blue shifts ( and hence low luminosities ) must necessarily be close to earth and have offsetting low red shifts ; while the high blue shift jets ( with high @xmath4 ) are distant with an offsetting high red shift .",
    "so the combined kinematic smearing varies little , thus allowing grbs to have a narrow @xmath0 distribution despite having a wide range of red shifts and luminosities .",
    "a narrow @xmath0 distribution requires both that the kinematic smearing be small and that the @xmath3 distribution be at least as narrow .",
    "the explanation just given answers only part of the requirements . a physical mechanism to explain why the @xmath3 distribution is so narrow is still needed ( such as in kazanas , georganopoulos , & mastichiadis 2002 ) .",
    "the size of the kinematic smearing depends on the exponent of @xmath4 in eq .",
    "5 . there will be additional smearing due to the finite width of the @xmath11 bins . with the model from eq .",
    "5 , i have calculated the total smearing across the bin for the faintest bursts ( @xmath43 ) over the normal range of red shifts ( @xmath42 ) . for an acceptable value of @xmath44",
    ", the smearing across this bin should be smaller than the observed spread of @xmath0 .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath0 distribution for the faintest bursts stretches from roughly 150 kev to 600 kev , a factor of 4 @xcite .",
    "the kinematic smearing is less than a factor of 4 for all values of @xmath44 less than 0.45 .",
    "the least smearing ( at 19% ) occurs for @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite discovered that bright bursts are harder than faint bursts , while @xcite showed specifically how @xmath46 varies with @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the general formalism from the previous section can yield a prediction for how @xmath46 varies with @xmath11 .",
    "the reason for this variation is a consequence of eq .",
    "5 . from fig . 1",
    ", we see that there is nearly a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "but the exact predicted function will depend on the distribution of bursts within a @xmath11 bin . if the median burst is roughly at a constant red shift ( specifically , at the strong inflection in the burst number density at @xmath47 @xcite ) , then eq .",
    "5 becomes @xmath48 since @xmath49 .",
    "alternatively , if the median burst is roughly at a constant luminosity ( specifically , at the break in the grb luminosity function around @xmath50 @xcite ) , then eq . 5 takes on a substantially more complex functional form that is similar to eq .",
    "the likely case is midway between these two extreme alternatives , with the median burst in each @xmath11 bin along a line roughly perpendicular to the line of constant @xmath11 . here",
    ", there is no simple expression although the @xmath0 distribution is close to a power law in @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath20 data from @xcite is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "what value of @xmath44 best fits the data based on eq .",
    "the chi - square is minimized for @xmath44 equal to @xmath51 . here",
    ", the median burst in each @xmath11 bin is taken to lie on a line perpendicular to the line of constant @xmath11 in the @xmath4 versus @xmath10 plot . in the next section",
    ", i will show that @xmath44 is equal to @xmath52 , and this is still an acceptable fit ( see fig .",
    "the point of this section is that eq .",
    "5 provides a simple and general explanation for the observed variation of @xmath20 with @xmath11 ( eq .",
    "6 ) . in words",
    ", the brighter bursts will have some combination of higher luminosities ( with a higher @xmath1 ) and be closer ( with a smaller @xmath2 ) than fainter bursts , so that the jet s blue shift and cosmological red shift will work together to give a higher @xmath0 for the brighter bursts .",
    "the values of @xmath26 and @xmath31 can tell us about the physics of gamma ray bursts .",
    "observations can place reliable constraints on both @xmath26 and @xmath31 .",
    "sections 2 and 3 have already provided limits , and two more observational constraints will now be presented .    for the 112 batse bursts with known @xmath4 and @xmath10 ( based on the measured lag and variability ) reported in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 value at the time of peak flux is known for 84 events .",
    "( the reason for why the 28 events do not have a measured @xmath0 is not known due to the untimely death of r. mallozzi . )",
    "5 shows that @xmath8 should vary with @xmath4 as a power law with index @xmath44 .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the logarithms of @xmath8 and @xmath4 are indeed accurately related linearly .",
    "a chi - square fit gives @xmath9 .",
    "this same method can be applied to 20 bursts which have the luminosities based on optically measured red shifts .",
    "figure 3 shows these bursts , with the data taken from the literature ( primarily @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this sample also shows a power law dependence , with a highly significant correlation ( @xmath53 , for a chance probability of @xmath54 ) .",
    "the slope is @xmath44 , which is fitted to be @xmath55 .",
    "the variability / luminosity relation @xcite can be used to constrain @xmath31 .",
    "variability ( @xmath56 ) is a measure of how spikey a burst light curve is , which empirically varies as the inverse of the rise times in the light curves .",
    "the rise times will be limited by the geometric delays which scale as @xmath57 , so @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite has shown from 9 bursts with measured red shifts that @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath60 , which is to say @xmath61 .",
    "i now have four observational restrictions and two theoretical restrictions on @xmath31 and @xmath26 .",
    "( 1 ) the narrowness of the observed @xmath0 distribution requires @xmath62 .",
    "( 2 ) the variation of @xmath20 with @xmath11 is easily explained if @xmath63 .",
    "( 3 ) the variation of @xmath8 with l for two independent set of bursts shows that @xmath44 equals @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "( 4 ) the variability / luminosity relation gives @xmath66 . ( 5 ) ordinary relativistic effects for any internal shock model implies that @xmath67 .",
    "( 6 ) the conversion of the jet energy to thermal energy suggests that @xmath68 .",
    "constraints 1 - 3 reduce to @xmath9 .",
    "constraints 4 and 5 give @xmath69 .",
    "these two results then imply that @xmath70 , which is consistent with constraint 6 . in round numbers , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "what should very high red shift ( @xmath13 ) grbs look like ? a first guess ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be that the cosmological red shift will transform them to appear more like x - ray bursts with @xmath73 kev .",
    "the analysis in this paper shows that this first guess is wrong since the @xmath13 bursts must have a very high luminosity and hence a very high @xmath1 which will blue shift the @xmath0 back to gamma - ray energies . in particular , from either equation 5 or figure 1 , we see that the highest red shift bursts will all have the same @xmath0 as the nearby events of the same @xmath11 .",
    "thus , any @xmath74 bursts that are in the batse catalog will have @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite have used batse real - time data to look at fast x - ray transients discovered by the bepposax satellite @xcite .",
    "they find that these events have similar light curves and durations as grbs , which is suggestive that the events are normal bursts .",
    "their peak flux is up to 3 times lower than the batse trigger threshold while their median @xmath0 value is 70 kev .",
    "the natural suggestion was made that very faint and very soft bursts might be at very high red shift .",
    "however , the model presented in this paper shows that _ all _ bursts below the batse threshold will on average have a low @xmath0 , with no necessity of high red shift .",
    "( this is also realized from a simple extrapolation of the data from mallozzi et al . as shown in figure 2 . )",
    "that is , a low @xmath11 is due to some combination of low luminosity ( hence a low blue shift from the jet ) and large distance ( hence a large cosmological red shift ) which will produce systematically low @xmath0 values .",
    "while some of the fast x - ray transients might be at high @xmath10 , the steepness of the grb luminosity function implies that almost all are at moderate red shift .",
    "it is disappointing that lines of constant @xmath0 are closely parallel to lines of constant @xmath11 in the @xmath4 versus @xmath10 plot .",
    "if this had not been true , then a simple measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath11 would define the bursts position in the plot and we would hence know the burst luminosity and red shift .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is approximately constant for all bursts .",
    "this constancy is similar to recent results that bursts are standard candles from the lag / luminosity and variability / luminosity relations as well as that the total energy of bursts is nearly a constant .",
    "thus it now seems that many aspects of grbs are constant , despite the chaotic appearance of their light curves .",
    "one implication of this constancy is that grbs might prove useful as tools for cosmology .",
    "the lag / luminosity and variability / luminosity relations will be the primary methods of getting luminosity distances .",
    "unfortunately , these relations are not as tight as we might hope .",
    "it is possible that @xmath0 might be used as a third parameter to improve the distance indicators , much as the cepheid luminosities are improved with a period / color / luminosity relation .",
    "thus , lag/@xmath0/luminosity and variability/@xmath0/luminosity relations might substantially improve the accuracy of grbs as standard candles .",
