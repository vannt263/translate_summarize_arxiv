    "construction of chiral gauge theory is one of the long standing problems of lattice field theories . because of the fermion doubling problem ,",
    "the lattice field theory discretized naively becomes non - chiral .",
    "several approaches on lattice have been proposed to overcome this difficulties , but none of them have been proven to be successful .    recently kaplan has proposed a domain - wall model in order to construct lattice chiral gauge theories@xcite .",
    "the model consists of wilson fermion action in ( 2@xmath0 + 1 ) dimensions with a fermion mass term being the shape of a domain wall in the ( extra ) ( 2@xmath0 + 1)th dimension . in the case of free fermions",
    "it is shown for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the domain wall mass height , that a massless chiral state arises as a zero mode bound to the @xmath3-dimensional domain wall while all doublers have large masses of the lattice cutoff scale .    in a way of introducing dynamical gauge fields two variants of this model",
    "have been proposed : the waveguide model@xcite and the overlap formula@xcite .",
    "however , it has been reported that the chiral zero mode disappears for these two variants even in the weak coupling limit , due to the roughness of gauge field@xcite . in the original model the roughness of the gauge field",
    "is replaced with the dynamical gauge field in the extra dimension , and in the weak coupling limit of the @xmath3 dimensional coupling , @xmath3 dimensional links @xmath4 = 1 ( @xmath5 ) while only extra dimensional links @xmath6 become dynamical .",
    "we would like to know whether the fermionic zero modes exist on the domain wall or not in this limit .",
    "this question has already been investigated in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions@xcite , but the result , in particular , in the symmetric phase is not conclusive , due to peculiarity of the phase transition in the 2 dimensional u(1 ) spin model .",
    "therefore we numerically investigate this model with u(1 ) gauge field in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions and report the result here .",
    "before numerical investigation we estimate the effect of the dynamical gauge field in the extra dimension using the mean - field analysis . in our mean - field analysis",
    "all link variables in the extra dimension are replaced with @xmath7-independent constant @xmath8 @xmath9 , so that the fermion propagator is easily obtained@xcite @xmath10 here was denoted @xmath11 @xmath12 in ref.@xcite ] @xmath13_{s , t } \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "corresponding fermion masses are obtained from @xmath11 and @xmath16 in @xmath17 limit , and we found that fermionic zero modes exist only for @xmath18 .",
    "thus the critical value of domain wall mass is @xmath19 and therefore no zero mode survives if @xmath20 .",
    "we investigated the ( 4 + 1 ) dimensional u(1 ) model numerically , using a quenched approximation . at the zero physical gauge coupling the gauge field action of the model",
    "is reduced to the @xmath3 dimensional spin model with many copies : @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",
    "therefore there exists a phase transition which separates a broken phase from a symmetric phase .",
    "we calculated the order parameter @xmath23 using a rotational technique@xcite and found @xmath24 corresponds to the symmetric phase and @xmath25 to the broken phase .",
    "we calculated the fermion propagator over 50 configurations at @xmath25 and 0.29 on @xmath26 lattices with @xmath274 , 6 , 8 .",
    "for the fermion field we take periodic boundary conditions except the anti - periodic boundary condition in the 4th direction .",
    "the errors are estimated by the single elimination jack - knife method .    at @xmath28",
    "we obtained the inverse propagator @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "we obtain fermion mass squared , @xmath33 , by extrapolating @xmath29 and @xmath30 linearly to @xmath34 .      in fig.[fig : broken ] we plotted @xmath35 in the broken phase ( @xmath25 ) as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    as seen from this figure , the finite size effect is small , and the left - handed modes are always massive , while the right - handed modes are massless if @xmath2 is larger than about @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that chiral zero modes can exist in the broken phase .",
    "let us show the fermion mass in the symmetric phase ( @xmath24 ) in fig.[fig : symmetric ] . in the smallest lattice size",
    "the chiral zero modes seem to exist .",
    "= 7.5 cm    however , for large lattices , the mass difference between the left- and right - handed modes becomes smaller .",
    "this suggest that the fermion spectrum becomes vector - like in the infinite volume limit .",
    "however , since the fermion mass near @xmath37 is so small , from this data alone , we can not exclude a possibility that the critical mass @xmath38 is very close to @xmath39 .    to make a definite conclusion on the absence of chiral zero modes in the symmetric phase , we try to fit the fermion propagator using the form of the mean - field propagator with the fitting parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we show the quality of the fit in fig.[fig : propr ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    this figure shows that the fermion propagator is well described by the mean - field propagator .    in fig.[fig :",
    "fittingr ] and fig.[fig : fittingl ] we plotted the parameter @xmath8 obtained the above fit as a function of @xmath40    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    the parameter @xmath8 s are almost independent of @xmath2 at the each @xmath40 except for the right - handed ones at @xmath41 .",
    "the solid circles represent the order parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath8 at different @xmath2 are almost identical each other and are very similar to that of @xmath23 except the right - handed ones at @xmath41 .",
    "this suggest that @xmath8 can be identified with @xmath23 and therefore @xmath8 becomes zero as the lattice size goes to the infinity .",
    "if this is the case the fermion spectrum of this model becomes vector - like in the symmetric phase .",
    "we have carried out the numerical simulations of the u(1 ) original domain - wall model in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions in the weak coupling limit of the 4-dimensional coupling .    in the broken phase",
    ", there exist chiral zero modes on the domain wall for @xmath42 .",
    "the existence of the critical mass @xmath38 is predicted by the mean - field analysis . on the other hand , in the symmetric phase",
    ", the analysis using the mean - field propagator suggests that this model becomes vector - like .",
    "we should note , however , that the right - handed modes at @xmath41 behaves differently and the similar behavior was also found in the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional model@xcite .",
    "therefore in the future , we must investigate this point in detail , for example , increasing the statistics .",
    "besides this point the results from both phases suggest that this model becomes vector - like in the continuum limit , which should be taken at the critical point (: the point between two phases ) .",
    "therefore , it seems also difficult to construct a chiral gauge theory on lattice via the original domain - wall model .    9 d.b .",
