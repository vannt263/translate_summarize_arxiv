    "cdf ( collider detector at fermilab ) is a general purpose detector designed to study the high energy @xmath0 interactions produced at the tevatron collider .",
    "the tevatron has recently completed major upgrades to achieve higher energy ( 990  gev per beam ) and instantaneous luminosity ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "cdf has been upgraded to cdf - ii to cope with the higher interaction rate as well as to extend its physics reach in this new and more difficult environment@xcite .",
    "the cdf upgrades relevant for this paper are the tracker and the trigger .",
    "the tracker is composed of the central drift chamber ( cot ) and three independent silicon detectors ( layer00 , silicon vertex detector and intermediate silicon layers detector ) .",
    "the layer00 is made of one layer of radiation hard silicon microstrips ( with @xmath2 readout ) placed just outside of the beam pipe ( @xmath3 cm ) .",
    "the new silicon vertex detector ( svxii )  @xcite is made of five double - sided ( with @xmath2 and @xmath4 readout ) microstrip sensors arranged in a 12-fold azimuthal geometry and segmented in 6 longitudinal barrels ( 3 mechanical units , each read out at both ends ) along the beam line ( cdf @xmath5-axis ) .",
    "the silicon layers are posed between 2.5 and 10.6  cm from the beamline . with the length of about 1 meter",
    "the svxii covers 2 units in pseudorapidity .",
    "the isl is located between the svxii and the cot with one central layer at 23 cm from the beamline and two forward / backward layers respectively at 20 and 29 cm from the beamline .",
    "the cot is a multilayer drift chamber which covers the region between 46 cm and 131 cm from the beamline .",
    "it provides a high resolution measurement of the curvature and azimutal angle of the charged tracks .",
    "the cdf trigger has been completely rebuilt and it consists of three levels .",
    "its challenging task is to reduce the 5  mhz rate input to level 1 to the 50  hz allowed as maximum output rate from level  3 which is written directly to tape .",
    "levels 1 and 2 are implemented in hardware while level 3 is an executable running on a pc farm .",
    "the level 1 device most relevant to this paper is the extremely fast track finder processor ( xft )  @xcite which reconstructs 2-d tracks ( in the @xmath2 plane , transverse to the beam line ) in the central drift chamber ( cot ) .",
    "the online silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) is part of the level 2 trigger .",
    "it receives the list of cot tracks reconstructed by the xft processor ( for each track the curvature @xmath6 and azimutal angle @xmath7 are measured ) and the digitized pulse heights on the silicon layers ( @xmath8 channels ) .",
    "the svt links the xft tracks to the silicon hits and reconstructs tracks with offline - like quality . from simulation of the tracking algorithm on run",
    "i data the expected resolution of the svt is @xmath9mrad , @xmath10  gev / c , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the track impact parameter , i.e. the distance of closest approach of the particle trajectory elix to the @xmath5-axis of the cdf reference system ) .    by providing a precision measurement of the impact parameter of charged particle tracks",
    "svt allows triggering on events containing long lived particles .",
    "b hadrons in particular have a decay lenght of the order of 500  micron and tracks which come out of the b decay vertices have an impact parameter on average greater than 100  micron . the opportunity offered by the svt of triggering directly on b hadron decay vertices is available for the first time at a hadron collider .",
    "it greatly improves the capability of selecting online b events which was tightly bound to leptonic decay modes in the past .",
    "given the very large cross section for producing b hadrons of the tevatron ( 100 microbarn ) , cdf - ii expects to have access even to rare purely hadronic b decays like @xmath13 and @xmath14 hadrons , which are extremely interesting respectively for cp violation and @xmath15 mixing measurements .",
    "the svt has a very short time to keep up with the 50  khz level 1 accept rate and to perform its task ( on average about 20  @xmath16s per event ) .",
    "for this reason the whole svt design has been concentrated on speeding up operations .",
    "the svt has a widely parallelized design : it is made of 12 identical azimuthal slices ( `` wedges '' ) working in parallel .",
    "each wedge receives and processes data from only one svxii 30@xmath17 wedge .",
    "in addition the svt reconstructs only tracks in the transverse plane to the beamline ( stereo info from svxii is dropped ) and only with @xmath18 above 2  gev / c .",
    "the tracking process is performed in two steps :    * pattern recognition : candidate tracks are searched among a list of precalculated low resolution patterns ( `` roads '' ) ; * track fitting : a full resolution fit of the hit coordinates found within each road is performed using a linearized algorithm ;    the pattern recognition step is performed in a completely parallel way by the associative memory system which uses full custom vlsi chips ( amchips @xcite ) .",
    "the am system compares all the silicon clusters and xft tracks with the set of precalculated patterns .",
    "a pattern is defined as a combination of five bins ( `` superstrips '' ) : four superstrips correspond to the position coordinates of the particle trajectory on four silicon layers , which can be chosen among the five svxii layers and layer00 , the fifth superstrip corresponds to the azimuthal angle of the particle trajectory at a distance of 12  cm from the beam line .",
    "the output of am system is the list of patterns ( `` roads '' ) for which at least one hit has been found on each superstrip .",
    "each svt wedge uses 32k patterns which cover more than 95% of the phase space for @xmath19 2  gev / c .",
    "simulation studies have shown that svt performance is optimized ( in terms of processing time and final resolution ) by choosing a superstrip size of about 250  micron on the silicon layers and 5@xmath20 for the @xmath7 angle measured by xft .",
    "the track fitting method is based on linear approximations and principal component analysis  @xcite .",
    "the analytical relationship between the track parameters and the six measured hit coordinates ( hit positions on four silicon layers , curvature , and azimuthal angle of xft track ) can be expressed in terms of six equations : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vector of hit coordinates and @xmath23 = ( @xmath12,c , @xmath7 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) are respectively the impact parameter ( @xmath12 ) , the curvature ( @xmath6 ) and the azimuthal angle ( @xmath7 ) at the point of minimum approach to the @xmath5-axis , while @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are three independent constraints which all real tracks must satisfy ( within detector resolution effects ) . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants which depend only on the detector geometry and the magnetic field .",
    "after pattern recognition has been performed each track candidate is confined within one road and this information can be used to simplify the computation of equation  [ eq : linexp ] .",
    "the hit coordinates and track parameters are given by the sum of a term which depends only on the superstrip edge ( @xmath29 ) and an additional term ( @xmath30 ) which depends on the posistion of the hits within the superstrips .",
    "equation  [ eq : linexp ] becomes : @xmath31 where , @xmath32 is a constant which depends on the single road , while @xmath33 is the correction which depends on the precise hit positions inside the road .",
    "the @xmath34 coefficients are calculated offline , stored in rams and used on a track - by - track basis .",
    "therefore the track fitting task reduces to the fast computation of simple scalar products ( done by fpga chips ) @xmath35 which determine the small correction to add to the road dependent constant terms .",
    "the svt output is the list of high precision tracks which is sent to the trigger processors for the final level 2 trigger decision .",
    "svt is made by over one hundred vme boards housed in eight crates  @xcite .",
    "the installation has been completed and the system has been fully operational since the beginning of 2001 . in the following section we report on the performance achieved by the system in the early phase ( april - october 2001 ) of run ii .",
    "the correlation of the impact parameter @xmath12 versus the azimuthal angle @xmath7 of candidate tracks ( figure  [ figura1 ] ( _ top _ ) ) is the first evidence that the svt tracks are good .",
    "the plot shows the typical sine wave shape which is due to the fact that the position of the interaction vertex in the transverse plane ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) is displaced from the origin of cdf reference system . in this case",
    "the relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath7 for primary tracks is : @xmath38 a fit to the @xmath39 scatter plot provides a measure of the ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) coordinates with an accuracy of few microns .",
    "a beam displacement of few millimiters is a typical running condition for cdf . in principle",
    "this condition could be a problem because it generates unphysical large impact parameters which are erroneously interpreted by the level 2 trigger as the presence of b decays . in practice",
    "this potential problem is avoided by having a process running on the svt vme crate controller and performing a fit of the @xmath40 correlation to determine the beam offset .",
    "the beam position parameters are transferred to the svt which subtractes the beam offset internally ( figure  [ figura1 ] ( _ bottom _ ) ) . to remove possible additional misalignments among svxii barrels ,",
    "this is done independently for tracks in each of the six svxii @xmath5-barrels .",
    "following this procedure the level 2 trigger receives physical impact parameters ( i.e. measured with respect to the actual beam position ) .",
    "figure  [ figura2 ] shows the impact parameter distribution after correcting for the beam offset .",
    "this distribution is given by the convolution of the actual transverse beam profile with the intrinsic impact parameter resolution .",
    "a gaussian fit gives @xmath41  micron .",
    "correlation for svt track candidates before ( @xmath42 ) and after correcting for beam offset ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the average beam position in the transverse plane is measured with a fit to the top plot ( @xmath36=0.0995 cm and @xmath37=-0.3895  cm ) with a precision of @xmath44  micron .",
    "the regions without points around @xmath7=2.2 and @xmath7=4.2  rad are due to svxii wedges which were turned off when the data analysed in this paper were taken .",
    "the scale on the @xmath45 axis is radians , the scale on the @xmath46 axis is cm .",
    "[ figura1],width=283 ]    , width=283 ]    a big effort has been put in understanding the various factors which contribute to the svt impact parameter resolution .",
    "the goal is to improve it as much as possible , because the worse is the resolution the higher is the rate of the triggers based on impact parameter cuts .",
    "the potentially most relevant contribution to the @xmath12 resolution arises from the @xmath5-misalignment between the detector and the beam .",
    "the effect of a @xmath5-misalignment ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) shows up as a residual modulation in the impact parameter @xmath49 correlation obtained after correcting for the beam offset : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath5-coordinate of the point of closest approach of the particle trajectory to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "unfortunately @xmath51 is not measured by the svt , which receives the only @xmath5 information from the svxii segmentation into six barrels , therefore the beam tilt results in an irreducible widening of the @xmath12 distribution . in order to make this",
    "spread small compared to the natural beam width , svt requires the detector and the beam to be parallel within 100  @xmath16rad .",
    "assembly of the svxii barrels indeed met this specification  @xcite , the alignement of the beam orbit turned out to be more challenging . during the april - october data taking period ,",
    "the beam slope was significantly large : @xmath52rad , @xmath53rad , well beyond the svt specification .",
    "the effect of the @xmath5-misalignment on the impact parameter distribution was estimated using a special run taken with an approximately null beam tilt . in this case",
    "the @xmath12 distribution had @xmath54  micron , which is 10 micron smaller than the width found for the runs taken with significant beam tilt .",
    "work is in progress in order to have a good alignment as the standard running condition .",
    "there are two additional major contributions affecting the impact parameter resolution .",
    "the first is the relative misalignment among svxii wedges .",
    "this contribution can be easily corrected by performing the beam position fit and the corresponding impact parameter beam offset subtraction independently in each wedge .",
    "the size of this correction to the resolution is approximately 6  micron .",
    "the second contribution to the impact parameter resolution is a consequence of the linear approximation of the svt track fitting method , which assumes a first order expansion centered at the beam position .",
    "since during the april - october data taking the beam was very far from its nominal position ( @xmath55 mm away ) the effect of non linearity was significant : it reduced the impact parameter resolution by approximately 5 micron .",
    "this effect can be corrected by recalculating the constants used in equation  [ eq : toedge ] centering the expansion on the measured beam position . after applying all these corrections",
    "the impact parameter distribution was found to have a gaussian shape with a sigma of 48 micron for a run taken with the beam aligned in @xmath5 and @xmath7 , and the misalignement of silicon layers within a wedge .",
    "the correction for these effects is less straightforward because it requires reprogramming some svt boards and adjusting the detector geometry of the svt maps .",
    "the effect of these additional correction has been studied with the simulation and reduces the the width of @xmath12 distribution to 45 micron . ]",
    ".all these corrections can be easily implemented in the svt by modifying the constans loaded on the boards .",
    "they will be implemented in the next data taking after the october shutdown",
    ". the only ingredient out of the svt control is the beam alignment along @xmath5 .",
    "as anticipated the impact parameter distribution is the convolution of the actual transverse beam profile with the intrinsic impact parameter resolution . by using equation [ eq : dfcorr ]",
    "it can be shown that the covariance of the impact parameters of two tracks originating from the same vertex is proportional to the cosine of the opening angle between the two tracks : @xmath56 where the constant @xmath57 is the width of the actual transverse beam profile . by using this relation and october 2001 data",
    "it has been possible to measure the beam width ( 33 micron ) and consequently determine the intrinsic impact parameter resolution of the svt ( 35 micron ) by subtracting in quadrature @xmath57 from the impact parameter distribution width ( 48 micron ) .",
    "the estimate for the svt impact parameter resolution is well in agreement with early svt performance simulations .",
    "cdf has designed a trigger strategy ( `` hadronic b trigger '' ) based only on tracking to select hadronic b decays interesting for cp violation and b@xmath58 mixing .",
    "the idea is to select charmless decays ( b@xmath59 ) for cp violation and a collection of charmed decays ( b@xmath60 and b@xmath61 with the d@xmath62 and d@xmath63 ) for mixing .",
    "this trigger strategy relies on xft tracks at level 1 and svt tracks at level 2 .",
    "the most important ingredient are the level 2 impact parameter cuts which reduce the trigger rate by three orders of magnitude . for the success of this trigger strategy",
    "the svt performance is essential .    in october 2001",
    "cdf took the first test runs which implemented a simplified version of the hadronic b trigger .",
    "the level 1 required two opposite charge xft tracks with @xmath64 2 gev / c , @xmath65 5.5 gev / c and an opening angle smaller than 135@xmath17 .",
    "the level 2 required two good svt tracks with @xmath64 2 gev / c ( no impact parameter threshold was set for these preliminary test runs ) . using this data ( @xmath66 15  nb@xmath67 ) and a very simple selection based on decay length cuts ,",
    "a small signal of @xmath68 was reconstructed  @xcite ( figure  [ figura2 ] ) .",
    "although this is not a fully reconstructed hadronic b signal yet , it shows that the purity of the triggered sample allows extracting some heavy flavour signal even from a very small sample ( 15 nb@xmath67 ) . as data taking proceeds we expect to perform more sophisticated analysis and to isolate the first hadronic b signals . with the 2 fb@xmath67 of data",
    "cdf - ii plans to collect in run ii we expect to contribute significantly to the field of cp violation in b decays and b@xmath58 mixing .     and @xmath69 , and applying cuts optimized to select a @xmath68 signal .",
    "the scale of the horizontal axis is gev / c@xmath70.,width=283 ]",
    "the online silicon vertex tracker is the new level 2 trigger processor dedicated to the reconstruction of tracks within the tracking chamber and the silicon vertex detector of the cdf - ii experiment .",
    "the svt has been successfully installed and operated during the preliminary phase of run ii .",
    "the performance of the device has already shown to be very close to the design .",
    "the impact parameter resolution is as good as needed for a successful operation of the trigger provided that the tilt between the beam and the detector is not larger than 100 microradiants .",
    "cdf relies on svt tracks for trigger strategies dedicated to the selection of hadronic b decays .",
    "preliminary test runs implementing these strategies have been taken in october 2001 and the first signals of heavy flavours have been found .",
    "improvements of the svt performance are expected in the near future as the operating conditions will evolve from the commissioning to a more stable phase .",
    "pedestal adjustments , dead channels suppressions and a better tuning of the clustering algorithm are expected .",
    "fine tuning of the svt ( corrections for non - linearities and relative wedge - to - wedge misalignments ) will soon be implemented .",
