    "on modeling a complex dynamic system , a common problem is that there is insufficient information to identify a large number of parameter values in the model .",
    "for example in the field of systems biology , one frequent criticism of mathematical modeling is that one sometimes attempts to fit several data point with dozens or even hundreds of parameters .",

    "network robustness is a related problem .",
    "it has been suggested that robustness is a general property for many biological networks .",
    "as illustrated by barkai and leibler using the bacterial chemotaxis network model , a system is robust if its function is determined by one or a small number of composite quantities , and values of the latter are insensitive to variation of most control parameter @xcite . the projection method provides a natural framework for quantifying network robustness under perturbations    there are extensive discussions on whether one can use the parameters measured in vitro on modeling processes in vivo @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "there are inevitably interactions between the subsystem one examines and the remaining part of the living system , which are not present in the system in vitro .",
    "the projection method provides a theoretical explanation why in general the two sets of parameters should be different . even in the case that the memory kernel can be approximated by a delta function so the retarded memory term @xmath87",
    ", the interactions between the subsystem one models and the remaining degrees of freedom affect the dynamics of the subspace through renormalizing the model parameters @xcite .",
