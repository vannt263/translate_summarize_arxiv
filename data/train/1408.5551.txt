    "in general , for a given ionic compound a@xmath14b@xmath3 , the stoichiometry reflects the ratio of valences ( i.e. , the charges for each anion and cation ) . yet",
    ", some ionic compounds do not strictly obey this rule .",
    "for instance , mgo@xmath11 can be prepared at very high oxygen fugacities , in which anions form the peroxide group [ o@xmath11]@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the variation of stoichiometry comes from the formation of polyatomic anions ( such as those in peroxides , superoxides @xcite , polyiodides @xcite , .etc ) , without changing cation valences .",
    "it was found that peroxides ( usually unstable or metastable ) , become thermodynamically stable under higher pressures @xcite .",
    "it appears that increasing pressure promotes the formation of increasing oxidation states .",
    "our recent work has discovered that xe will form stable compounds with o under high pressure , in which xe exhibits high oxidation states of + 2 , + 4 , and + 6 @xcite . in this case , the new stoichiometry is no longer from the anion - anion bonds ( o - o ) , but from the increased valence of xe .",
    "elements around xe in the periodic table are expected to undergo similar transitions . in particular , cs , in the electronic configuration [ xe]6@xmath17@xmath18 ,",
    "is a natural choice to study this possibility .",
    "indeed , miao @xcite has recently reported that cs , under pressure , can adopt oxidation states higher than + 1 to form a series of stable csf@xmath3 compounds . according to miao s calculation ,",
    "csf@xmath11 becomes stable at 5 gpa , csf@xmath19 at 15 gpa , and csf@xmath20 at 50 gpa .",
    "considering [ csf@xmath11]@xmath2 and [ csf@xmath20 ] are isoelectronic to the well - known molecular xef@xmath11 @xcite and [ xef@xmath20]@xmath2 @xcite , this picture makes sense . however , miao suggested csf@xmath11 and csf@xmath12 might adopt structures similar to those of xef@xmath11 and xef@xmath12 , with the valence state of cs being + 2 and + 4 .",
    "in particular , an @xmath224/@xmath23 csf@xmath11 was proposed to be thermodynamically stable at 10 gpa , which appears to break the isoelectronic analogy and involve cs@xmath9 ions isoelectronic to unknown and unstable xe@xmath1 ion . to resolve this",
    ", we performed a comprehensive investigation of csf@xmath3 system under pressures up to 100 gpa .",
    "our calculation uncovers quite a different scenario from miao s report .",
    "we further explain that interplay between two mechanisms ( polyfluoride anions and evolution of cs valence state ) creates an unexpected variety of stable csf@xmath3 compounds under moderate pressure .",
    "we have performed variable - composition structure searches using the uspex code @xcite with up to 24 atoms in the unit cell at pressures at 0 and 100 gpa for the cs - f system , in which we found only csf@xmath3 ( @xmath241 ) to be stable , with csf being stable at all pressures .",
    "thus we focused our search on the csf - f system in the range of 0 , 30 , 50 , 75 , 100 gpa .",
    "these searches yielded the correct crystal structures for csf and f , and a series of polyfluoride compounds as stable states , including csf@xmath11 , csf@xmath19 , csf@xmath20 which are thermodynamically stable already at ambient pressure .",
    "as pressure increases , csf@xmath11 becomes unstable above 19 gpa , while csf@xmath12 appears on the convex hull between 17 - 80 gpa .",
    "csf@xmath19 and csf@xmath20 are stable in the entire pressure range up to 100 gpa .",
    "however , all of the stable compounds undergo a series of phase transitions , with dramatic changes of the electronic structure .",
    "let us first look at csf@xmath19 compounds . at ambient pressure",
    ", we find csf@xmath19 adopts a rhombohedral structure ( space group @xmath25 ) , which is made of cs@xmath1 and linear symmetric [ f@xmath19]@xmath2 species .",
    "the f - f distance in the [ f@xmath19 ] is 1.736  , indicating as expected weaker bonding than in the f@xmath11 molecule ( f - f bond length 1.442  ) .",
    "bader analysis also supports this conclusion : there is a charge transfer of 0.950 @xmath27 from cs to f@xmath19 species , very close to the value in csf ( 0.928 @xmath27 ) , but the charge distribution within f@xmath19 is not even : two end f atoms have the charge of -0.406 @xmath27 , while the central atom only has -0.138 @xmath27 .",
    "trihalide anions [ x@xmath19]@xmath2 ( x = br , i ) are well known .",
    "but , the [ f@xmath19]@xmath2 species has only been experimentally found as csf@xmath19 complexes in argon matrix @xcite . here , we for the first time report its existence in a thermodynamically stable crystalline phase .",
    "according to dft calculation , @xmath25-csf@xmath19 is stable against decomposition to csf and f@xmath11 ( the formation energy is about -0.189 ev / atom at t = 0 k , p = 1 atm ) . at 27 gpa , csf@xmath19 undergoes a phase transition to a monoclinic phase @xmath282/@xmath29 .",
    "more interestingly , this structural transition coincides with a striking increase in cs s bader charge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - csf3 ] . at 30 gpa",
    ", cs has a charge of + 1.7 @xmath27 , far beyond the + 1 valence state for alkali elements under ambient conditions , suggesting cs@xmath30 has been further oxidized .",
    "our previous study has shown that xe under high pressure can be oxidized to + 2 , + 4 , + 6 valence states .",
    "cs@xmath7 is isoelectronic to xe@xmath9 .",
    "this phase transition can be interpreted as a transition from cs@xmath1[f@xmath19]@xmath2 to [ csf@xmath11]@xmath1[f]@xmath2 .",
    "this is also evidenced by the dramatic change of cs(f)-f distance . in the @xmath282/@xmath29 phase , there are two types of f atoms ( f1 and f2 ) , each cs is surrounded by 2 f1 and 4 f2 . at 50 gpa ,",
    "the calculated cs - f1 distance is 2.01  , while the cs - f2 distance is 2.58  , consistent with a jahn - teller distortion related to the open - shell cs@xmath7 configuration .",
    "compared with cs - f bond length ( 2.69  ) in ionic csf , we conclude that cs - f2 interaction is very close to a typical ionic cs - f bond , while each individual cs - f1 bond has much stronger interaction ( more covalent bonding ) .",
    "therefore , it can be viewed as [ csf@xmath11]@xmath1[f]@xmath2 complex .",
    "a similar discussion can be also found in miao s work @xcite .",
    "but his previously proposed @xmath282/@xmath31 structure is less stable than the @xmath282/@xmath29 structure found here .",
    "similar to csf@xmath19 , csf@xmath20 is also stable in the entire investigated pressure range between 0 - 100 gpa . at 0 gpa , we found a monoclinic @xmath322@xmath33 phase is stable against decomposition to any other stable compositions ( cs , csf , csf@xmath19 , f ) .",
    "@xmath322@xmath33-csf@xmath20 can be described as packing of cs@xmath1 and [ f@xmath20]@xmath2 species .",
    "[ f@xmath20]@xmath2 ion has a v - shape and f - f bond lengths are 1.617 , 1.953 , 1.858 , 1.617  , and f - f - f bond angle at central f atom is 98.592@xmath13 .",
    "bader analysis shows that the entire f@xmath20 group has charge -0.958 @xmath27 .",
    "the hypothetical pentafluoride anion [ f@xmath20]@xmath34 has also been proposed by riedel @xcite , and we confirm it can exist at ambient pressure in a stable compound . at 4 gpa , a new phase with [ f@xmath20]@xmath34 groups and @xmath282/@xmath29 symmetry becomes stable . around 21 gpa ,",
    "@xmath282/@xmath29 phase transforms to another monoclinic @xmath282/@xmath31 phase , which can be represented as [ csf@xmath11 ] [ f@xmath19 ] .",
    "the [ csf@xmath11 ] unit is very similar to the one in @xmath282/@xmath29-csf@xmath19 ( bader charge is 0.820@xmath27 ) , indicating that cs achieves + 3 state . at the same time , [ f@xmath19 ]",
    "is a typical polyfluoride anion with bader charge -0.820@xmath27 ; thus the whole structure can be viewed as [ csf@xmath11]@xmath1[f@xmath19]@xmath2 . at 47 gpa ,",
    "consistent with miao s results@xcite , we found a structure based on the packing of csf@xmath20 molecules .",
    "we again plot the variation of cs s bader charge in stable csf@xmath20 compounds with pressure .",
    "indeed , analysis indicates a continuous two - step electronic transition of cs , coinciding with the transition sequence ( from @xmath282/@xmath29 to @xmath282/@xmath31 at 21 gpa , and from @xmath282/@xmath31 to @xmath35 at 47 gpa ) .",
    "our results show csf@xmath19 and csf@xmath20 are stable alongside the known compound csf in the whole investigated pressure range ( 0 - 100 gpa ) .",
    "unlike the recently discovered exotic sodium chlorides @xcite , most of which are metallic , all of the predicted caesium fluorides are insulators .",
    "there are two factors determining the stoichiometry of these insulating compounds : ( 1 ) cs s valence state transition ( + 1 @xmath36 + 3 @xmath36 + 5 ) ; ( 2 ) formation of polyfluoride anions ( [ f@xmath19]@xmath34 , [ f@xmath20]@xmath34 ) . note that this is different from the previous study @xcite , in which the latter factor was overlooked , along with a large number of stable phases . due to these two competing mechanisms , one can expect other stoichiometries can be stabilized as well .",
    "indeed , we found csf@xmath11 and csf@xmath12 can be stable at intermediate pressure ranges .    previously , a tetragonal ( @xmath224/@xmath23 ) xef@xmath11-like molecular structure was proposed to be stable at 5 - 20 gpa @xcite .",
    "our search found molecular csf@xmath11 crystal to be unstable against decomposition to csf@xmath19 and csf at all pressures .",
    "a class of csf@xmath11 compounds , however , has been found to be stable at low pressures in our prediction . at 0 gpa",

    "therefore , [ cs]@xmath9 is not favoured by energy , but csf@xmath11 can be stabilized due to the formation of the [ f@xmath12]@xmath16 anion .",
