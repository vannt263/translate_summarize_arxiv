    "these points in @xmath95 are then in turn mapped to points in the moduli space @xmath105 by the above equivalence relation .    denoting this composition by @xmath109",
    ", it follows from the uniqueness part of theorem 3.1 that @xmath109 is injective .",
    "also , @xmath109 is surjective from the existence part of theorem 3.1 . using conformal mappings to standard domains which preserves the above labelling of complementary components shows that sets of equivalence classes in @xmath105 for which the numbers associated with the corresponding standard domains lie in a closed subset of @xmath106 are themselves closed ( note that the notion of labelling and convergence in @xmath95 is exactly the same as that used at the start of the proof of this theorem ) . from this",
