    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) integer - spin heisenberg antiferromagnets ( haf ) are well - known for the haldane energy gap @xcite between the singlet spin - liquid ground state and the lowest excited state , which is an @xmath8 triplet .",
    "the application of a magnetic field leads to zeeman splitting of the triplet and eventual vanishing of the gap @xmath9 at @xmath10 , where the energy of the lowest branch of the split triplet reaches the ground - state level . at this critical field ,",
    "the expected quantum transition is to the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid , @xcite in which spin correlations decay with characteristic power laws .",
    "this scenario remains robust in an array of 1d integer - spin haf chains against the introduction of interchain exchange .",
    "such a coupling reduces @xmath7 but , provided it is small , does not destroy the singlet ground state below @xmath7 . above @xmath7 , it leads to finite - temperature long - range order ( lro ) , which can be described as the three - dimensional bose - einstein condensation of the lower - branch triplets .",
    "@xcite the nature of the ordered state , including the robustness of the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid , is of strong current interest .",
    "the first experimental evidence @xcite of a haldane gap was found in csnicl@xmath11 .",
    "this material has a relatively large interchain coupling : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are interchain and in - chain exchanges , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "n@xmath15el ordering occurs at 4.85 k. ni(c@xmath3h@xmath16n@xmath3)@xmath3no@xmath3(clo@xmath17 ) ( nenp ) , with the small @xmath18 ratio of @xmath19 , was the first haldane - gap antiferromagnet with no n@xmath15el ordering .",
    "@xcite magnetic susceptibility shows no anomaly indicative of ordering , at least down to 4  mk .",
    "@xcite naturally , this material was a promising candidate for the field - induced lro at fields above @xmath7 .",
    "however , it has been found that such an order is preempted by the staggered effective field arising from the staggered _ g _ tensors of the ni@xmath20 ions within each spin chain .    to date , another spin-1 chain material ni(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)@xmath3n@xmath4(pf@xmath5 ) ( ndmap ) remains the only laboratory model of a 1d haf array in which the nature of the field - induced lro states has been revealed by experiment .",
    "@xcite this distinction owes to the unusually low @xmath7 , which is readily accessible to many experimental probes , as well as the absence of a staggered field .",
    "ndmap has an orthorhombic structure with the lattice parameters @xmath21   , @xmath22   , and @xmath23   , with the antiferromagnetic spin chains running along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "@xcite according to inelastic neutron scattering , @xcite the in - chain exchange is @xmath25  k , and the relative strengths of the interchain exchanges are @xmath26 and @xmath27 along the @xmath28 and @xmath29 axes , respectively .",
    "easy - plane crystal - field anisotropy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the crystallographic @xmath24 axis and @xmath32 , @xcite is responsible for the strong anisotropy of both the gap @xmath9 and the magnetic phase diagram of the field - induced lro states , as has been measured by magnetic susceptibility , @xcite specific heat , @xcite magnetization , @xcite esr , @xcite and neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite    the gap energies of the triplet , whose degeneracy is lifted by the crystal - field anisotropy , have been measured by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite to be @xmath33 mev , @xmath34 mev , and @xmath35 mev for the @xmath36 excitations quantized along the @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath24 axes , respectively .",
    "here @xmath37 is the quantization axis .",
    "the small splitting of a doublet into @xmath38 and @xmath39 is due to a weak in - plane anisotropy @xmath40 . because of the gap anisotropy , @xmath7 depends on the crystal orientation and ranges from about 4 t to 6 t. @xcite above @xmath7 , the ordered states are commensurate with the crystal lattice for all four magnetic - field directions studied by neutron diffraction .",
    "@xcite for field @xmath41 applied along the @xmath29 axis and along @xmath42 $ ] , the order is short - ranged and confined within each @xmath43 plane , whereas it is long - ranged and three - dimensional for @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the neutron experiments have detected no incommensurate modulation of the magnetization component parallel to the field .",
    "such a modulation has been predicted for the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid , @xcite and its absence in ndmap can be understood as a consequence of a lack of axial symmetry , which is necessary for the existence of the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid .",
    "@xcite it is important to note that even @xmath44 is not an axisymmetric field configuration for ndmap because of its unique geometry . in this material , the crystal - field anisotropy of ni@xmath20",
    "is determined by the local symmetry of the nin@xmath46 octahedron .",
    "first , there is a weak in - plane anisotropy as described above .",
    "second and probably more important , the principal axis of the octahedron is tilted from the @xmath24 axis by 15@xmath47 toward the @xmath29 axis , with the tilt direction alternating from chain to chain .",
    "@xcite therefore , there is no magnetic - field direction that strictly satisfies axial symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the field - induced lro states to 32 t in field and 150 mk in temperature by means of specific heat measurements .",
    "the present study greatly extends the @xmath41-@xmath48 parameter space for the phase diagram , which has been previously limited @xcite to 12  t in @xmath41 and 0.52  k in temperature @xmath48 except for a few isolated points obtained by neutron diffraction @xcite at lower temperatures with less precision .",
    "preliminary results have been reported in ref .  .",
    "the single crystals of ndmap used in this work were grown from aqueous solutions by the method described in ref .  .",
    "fully deuterated crystals were used to eliminate the nuclear specific heat of protons in the set of measurements extending to the lowest temperature , whereas a hydrogenous sample was used when adequate .",
    "the specific heat measurements to 18 t were performed in a superconducting magnet at temperatures down to 150 mk with a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the relaxation calorimeter for this setup has been described in ref .  .",
    "for measurements from 20 t to 32 t , another relaxation calorimeter with a built - in @xmath49he refrigerator was used in a resistive bitter magnet . each sample for the @xmath44 configuration was attached with silver paint @xcite to the vertical face of a small silver bracket , whose horizontal face was in turn glued with a wakefield compound @xcite to the calorimeter platform .",
    "the sample for the @xmath50 configuration was mounted with silver paint on a piece of 0.13  mm - thick sapphire substrate , which in turn was glued with a wakefield compound to the platform .",
    "a total of three samples ranging in mass from 4 mg to 8 mg were used to cover the different field ranges and orientations .     axis .",
    "( a ) temperature dependence at constant fields .",
    "the inset gives an expanded view of the region near the specific heat peak .",
    "( b ) magnetic - field dependence at constant temperatures .",
    "the lines are guides for the eye . ]    the magnetic - field and temperature dependence of the specific heat of a deuterated sample is shown in fig .  1 for fields up to 18 t , applied along the @xmath24 axis of the crystal .",
    "at each field , the peak in the specific heat seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) clearly indicates a phase transition .",
    "as can be seen in the inset , the transition temperature denoted by the peak position first increases with increasing field up to about 10 t and then decreases for fields up to 14 t , where it starts to increase again , making a shallow local minimum at around 14 t. furthermore , the peak height has a less pronounced minimum at roughly the same field .",
    "these features reveal the existence of a new phase boundary , which separates two field - induced ordered states at around 14 t. for temperatures less than 0.85 k , specific heat is shown as a function of the magnetic field in fig .",
    "again , the peak clearly indicates a phase transition .",
    "we have confirmed that the transition temperatures determined by such magnetic - field scans agree with those determined by the temperature scans .     axis .",
    "the lines are guides for the eye . ]    the specific heat for the same field direction at higher fields produced by the resistive magnet are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these data were obtained with the hydrogenous sample . at 26 t , the nuclear contribution of the protons is visible at temperatures below 0.7 k. however , the peak due to transition stands out , since it occurs at a higher temperature . in this field region extending from 20 t to 32 t , the transition temperature obtained from the peak position varies only monotonically , and so does the peak height .     axis .",
    "the anomaly at the lowest field of each curve is due to the proximity of the transition to the disordered spin - liquid phase .",
    "the uninteresting proton contribution raises the curve at 0.260.29 k with respect to those at higher temperatures .",
    "the lines are guides for the eye . ]",
    "to further investigate the phase diagram near 14 t , we have measured the specific heat of the same hydrogenous sample as a function of the magnetic field , again applied along the @xmath24 axis , but to higher fields than in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in these measurements ,",
    "a constant electric current was fed to the heater of the thermal reservoir of the calorimeter , allowing the temperature to rise monotonically with an increasing field as dictated by the magnetoresistance of the heater . as seen in fig .  3 ,",
    "a plateau - like anomaly in the specific heat occurs at around 14 t , clearly indicating a phase transition .",
    "this anomaly was overlooked in our preliminary report , @xcite where the field range investigated was too narrow .",
    "within the experimental resolution , no corresponding feature is found in magnetization , which has been measured at 80  mk and 1.3  k using a pulsed magnet and is featureless up to 60 t except for an anomaly at @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite     axis .",
    "the lines are guides for the eye . ]    for magnetic fields applied along the crystallographic @xmath29 axis , which is perpendicular to the spin chains , another deuterated sample was used to measure the specific heat at temperatures below 2.7 k as a function of field , as shown in fig .",
    ", a transition to the field - induced ordered phase is clearly indicated by a peak at each temperature . for fields ranging from 6.2  t to 6.5  t",
    ", these measurements were supplemented by temperature sweeps similar to those shown in fig .",
    "no new phase boundary was found for this field direction up to 18  t.     axis and the closed symbols for the field along the @xmath29 axis .",
    "the circles are for the deuterated samples , and the squares and diamonds for the hydrogenous sample .",
    "the lines are guides for the eye . ]",
    "the magnetic phase diagram determined from the positions of the specific - heat peaks and the plateau - like anomalies is shown in fig .  5 for the two magnetic - field directions studied .",
    "when the field is along the @xmath24 axis , the transition temperature exhibits a shallow but distinct local minimum at about @xmath6  t , and a new phase boundary extends nearly horizontally from this minimum . the small break in the phase boundary between the new high - field phase and the thermally disordered phase at around 20  t indicates that the hydrogenous sample has a slightly higher transition temperature than the deuterated sample .",
    "as stated earlier , the calorimeters used for the two samples were different .",
    "however , we have confirmed in another experiment the consistency of the temperature scales of the two calorimeters .",
    "therefore , the discontinuity in the phase boundary is not an artifact and indicates that deuterated ndmap in fact has a somewhat weaker exchange .",
    "when the field is along the @xmath29 axis , the transition temperature rises rapidly with increasing field , with no indication of a new phase .",
    "this is the first time more than one field - induced ordered phase has been found in a quasi-1d antiferromagnet for a given magnetic - field orientation .",
    "we believe it is significant that the field direction required for the new phase is along the crystalline @xmath24 axis .",
    "this direction , parallel to the spin chains , is quite unlike the @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath51 $ ] directions in that the ordering field rises very rapidly with temperature in the overall @xmath41-@xmath48 phase diagram .",
    "@xcite this feature probably exemplifies the underlying tendency of the spin chains in this field configuration to form a tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid , as has been presumed earlier .",
    "@xcite hence it is likely that identifying the new phase above @xmath52 and understanding the mechanism of the transition will shed light on the physics of the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid .    at present , however , with the absence of experimental data in the field region near and above @xmath52 other than the specific heat and magnetization , which shows no anomaly at @xmath52 , we can at best speculate on the nature of the transition .",
    "one possible scenario can be a transition involving spin rotation around the direction of the applied field , which is parallel to the spin chains .",
    "such an exotic transition has been observed for instance in a spin-1/2 chain material bacu@xmath53si@xmath53o@xmath54 , where it is presumably driven by a competition between an off - diagonal exchange and the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite although the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , @xcite the likely candidate for the off - diagonal exchange , is usually quite small for ni@xmath20 and has not been detected in ndmap , a spin - rotation transition is an interesting possibility .",
    "recently , wang @xcite has considered a spin-1 chain with broken symmetry using a fermionic field theory and has predicted that a magnetic field larger than @xmath7 will restore an approximate axial symmetry and lead to a well - defined second transition from a commensurate phase to an incommensurate phase . unlike in the tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid",
    ", the excitations in the incommensurate phase will be gapped .",
    "however , the gap will be small and roughly equal to @xmath55 , when the field is applied along the chain direction @xmath24 .",
    "although wang has predicted an absence of anomaly in specific heat  as well as magnetization  at the second transition , which is other than first - order , it is worth exploring the possibility of the phase above @xmath52 being an incommensurate phase .     and @xmath29 axes .",
    "the closed symbols are for the deuterated samples of the present work , where the circles are from the temperature - scan data and the diamonds from the field - scan data .",
    "the open circles are for hydrogenous samples from ref .  .",
    "the lines are low - temperature fits of the phase boundaries of the deuterated samples to the expression @xmath56 . ]    the bose - einstein condensation of triplets is believed to be a valid description of field - induced lro in all gapped antiferromagnets , regardless of the type of disordered ground state below @xmath7 and the type of the ordered state above it , provided that the lowest excitations are bosons . according to the bose - einstein condensation theory , @xcite the phase boundary in the @xmath41-@xmath48 parameter space obeys a power law @xmath56 .",
    "the field - induced ordering in the @xmath57 spin - dimer material tlcucl@xmath11 was the first case that was analyzed in terms of the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "@xcite however , the exponent @xmath58 of 0.50 determined @xcite for this material is smaller than the theoretical value of 2/3 obtained by a hartree - fock approximation for a quadratic dispersion for the triplets . the exponent for ni(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)@xmath3n@xmath4(clo@xmath17 ) ( ndmaz ) ,",
    "a spin-1 chain material @xcite similar to ndmap , has been reported to be 0.45 for the magnetic field applied along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "@xcite this value is also significantly smaller than the theoretical one .    the four - fold improvement in the minimum temperature over the previous work @xcite for the field directions along the @xmath24 and @xmath29 axes allows us to determine the field dependence of the ordering temperature near @xmath7 with high accuracy .",
    "the relevant portions of the phase boundaries from fig .  5 are reproduced in fig .",
    "6 , separately for the two field directions .",
    "these boundaries , shown with closed symbols , are for deuterated samples .",
    "excellent fits of the data below 0.77  k for @xmath44 and below 1.9  k for @xmath50 are obtained with the power law , giving @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the critical fields are @xmath61  t and @xmath62  t , respectively , along the @xmath24 and @xmath29 axes .",
    "recently , specific heat measurements of the @xmath63 bond - alternating - chain antiferromagnet ni(c@xmath64h@xmath65n@xmath17)no@xmath3(clo@xmath17 ) ( ntenp ) have found @xmath66 and 0.52 , respectively , for the field parallel and perpendicular to the spin chains .",
    "@xcite the similarity of these exponents to those for ndmap suggests that ntenp has similar field - induced ordered phases , although its low - field ground state is a spin - dimer singlet@xcite rather than a haldane spin liquid .",
    "including ours , all the experimental values found to date for the exponent @xmath58 are smaller than 2/3 predicted by the theory .",
    "however , the values for ndmap and ntenp for the magnetic field applied along the chain direction agree , within the combined uncertainties of the experiments and the calculation , with the quantum monte - carlo results by wessel  @xmath67 .",
    ", @xcite who have found @xmath68 for @xmath57 spin dimers with a weak three - dimensional inter - dimer coupling and @xmath69 for two - leg spin-1/2 ladders with a weak three - dimensional inter - ladder coupling .",
    "their results support the bose - einstein condensation theory , according to the quantum monte - carlo calculation for three - dimensionally coupled @xmath57 spin dimers by nohadani  @xmath67 .",
    ", @xcite who have shown that @xmath58 deviates downward from 2/3 , as the temperature range of the power - law fit is widened .",
    "furthermore , misguich and oshikawa @xcite have used a realistic dispersion for the triplets in tlcucl@xmath11 in their calculation of the field dependence of the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xmath70 and found good agreement with the experiment .",
    "@xcite it remains to be seen , however , whether the bose - einstein condensation theory can explain the strongly anisotropic @xmath58 for ndmap and ntenp , particularly the extremely small @xmath58 when the field is applied along the spin chains .    in fig .",
    "6 , we have included the phase boundaries for hydrogenous samples from the previous work , as shown with open symbols .",
    "@xcite again , the ordering temperature is somewhat higher for the hydrogenous samples except at the fields of 10 t and 12 t applied parallel to the @xmath24 axis , whereas @xmath7 is identical for a given field direction within our accuracy .",
    "this indicates that the interchain exchange @xmath13 is slightly weaker in deuterated ndmap than in hydrogenous ndmap , since decreasing @xmath13 lowers the ordering temperature directly but has little effect on @xmath7 , which is primarily determined by the in - chain exchange @xmath14 . a previous study , @xcite which compared the phase diagrams of deuterated and hydrogenous samples for @xmath41 along the @xmath28 axis , saw a much smaller but qualitatively similar difference .",
    "we propose that the smaller @xmath13 for deuterated ndmap is caused by the smaller zero - point motion of deuterons leading to less overlap of the electronic wavefunctions in the exchange paths involving hydrogens . in some classical antiferromagnets , such as the linear - chain compound ( ch@xmath11)@xmath71nmncl@xmath11 ( tmmc ) , deuteration has been reported to reduce the n@xmath15el temperature .",
    "@xcite in the quasi - two - dimensional organic salt @xmath72-(bedt - ttf)@xmath53cu[n(cn)@xmath53]br , substituting deuterium for the hydrogen of the ethylene groups has been shown to drive the system from a superconductor to an antiferromagnetic mott insulator .",
    "@xcite to our knowledge , however , the present work represents the first observation of an effect of deuteration in a haldane - gap antiferromagnet .    in summary",
    ", the magnetic phase diagram of ndmap has been extended by specific - heat measurements to 150  mk in temperature and 32 t in the magnetic field .",
    "a new transition has been found at @xmath6  t , when the field is parallel to the spin chains .",
    "further study using techniques other than specific heat is needed to investigate the nature of the new phase , including the possibility that it is an incommensurate phase . in addition , we have determined the power - law exponents for the transition temperatures of the field - induced ordering from the spin - liquid state and compared them with the exponents for tlcucl@xmath11 , ndmaz , and ntenp and with the predictions of the bose - einstein condensation theory .",
    "finally , we have observed an effect of deuterium substitution on the ordering temperature .",
    "the result indicates that the substitution slightly decreases the interchain exchange @xmath13 but hardly affects the in - chain exchange @xmath14 .",
