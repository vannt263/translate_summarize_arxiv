    "a long standing tradition in the field of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , especially those in connection with biophysical dynamics @xcite has been to look at the high temperature limit of all such models where thermal fluctuations dominate every other stochastic mode in the system .",
    "such an approach generally has the advantage of having to deal only with a thermal noise that dominates all non - thermal motions in the mesoscopic limit .",
    "both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , the subject is replete with such examples , and often with agreeable results too , where such an assumption agrees with the physiology of the real system .",
    "problems , though , surface when the approach contradicts its basic tenet in that the system has a non - trivial non - thermal force that competes , and sometimes even out - competes , the thermal fluctuations at the experimental setting @xcite . in the present article ,",
    "our focus is on the latter situation when the system has a non - trivial component of non - thermal fluctuation eg .",
    "cytoskeletal fluctuation @xcite whose contribution can not be neglected in comparison to its thermal counterpart .",
    "a similar , if not identical , question in connection is whether or not there exists a non - equilibrium version of the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) theorem in the mould of an jarzynski relation @xcite .",
    "our approach , though , will rely on a relative comparison of strengths between thermal and non - thermal ( stochastic ) fluctuations connected to identical reservoirs .",
    "+    a remarkable range of such non - thermal fluctuations are visible in the biological world , a typical case in hand being the fluctuations due to bio - chemical and molecular movements , popularly referred to as cytoskeletal fluctuations. recent studies @xcite have traced the origin of such ( generally ) non - thermal cytoskeletal dynamics to a combination of cell crawling , adhesion between lipid bilayers and randomness in the responses of molecular motor proteins . in this article , though , we would not pay so much of attention as to the origin of such motions ; rather our focus would be on a relative comparison of strengths between a brownian thermal noise against a randomness that is mostly non - thermal in origin eg .",
    "cytoskeletal fluctuations and whose strength is proportional to @xmath1 , @xmath2 being a non - equilibrium temperature. the langevin and fokker - planck type models based on such a description @xcite generally utilize the fact that the amplitude of thermal motion thoroughly dominates all other mesoscopic level fluctuations that are otherwise present in the dynamics .",
    "although such an approach works remarkably well in many cases @xcite , and we are mostly focusing on native biological systems involving cytoskeletons , serious complications arise in cases where the cytoskeletal fluctuations are non - negligible .",
    "the simple question one would like to ask here is the following : what are those situations when such a non - thermal motion competes with a thermal fluctuation attached to a heat bath @xcite ?",
    "a notable contribution to the understanding of such non - thermally initiated fluctuations owes to prost and bruinsma @xcite .",
    "they showed that in systems involving active membranes the long - wavelength limit of the fluctuation spectrum follows a power law behavior that is quite different from a membrane in thermal equilibrium . using this approach they were successful in analyzing the experimental results on red - blood cells @xcite where cytoskeletal fluctuations were convincingly seen to be dominating the thermal ones .",
    "similar studies dealing with the effect of non - thermal motions in the intra - cellular trafficking involving membrane fluctuations @xcite , or in the travelling waves observed due to protein activity in a flexible membrane @xcite , as well as in micropipet experiments using an activated membrane surface @xcite lend credence to the belief that active non - thermal motion can indeed have a dramatic effect on the overall dynamics of a non - equilibrium system , especially when there is a competition with a fluctuations arising from a stochastic thermal bath .    in this article , we study the regime when the two noise modes , thermal and non - thermal , compete with each other",
    ". ramifications of such comptetitions are amply evident in experiments @xcite and our attention here is to quantify the limits of the parameter that defines such a regime .",
    "as we would later see , the parameter in question is the relaxation time @xmath0 that , in a way , offers a complementary description to that studied in @xcite .",
    "we study the model in both asymptotic limits of @xmath0 and predict values ( indeed limits ) of @xmath0 for which thermal noise dominates ( or competes with ) its non - thermal counterpart .",
    "our basic model consists of a large flat d+1 dimensional membrane driven by thermal fluctuations where the free energy is helfrich - like @xcite , involving a term that is proportional to the energy cost due to surface tension and another term that represents the bending energy associated with the existence of curvature in a membrane . in our nomenclature , we will represent the surface tension term as @xmath3 and a curvature term @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the present article , we focus only on the linear regime of such an intrinsically non - linear potential ( in the mould of @xcite ) .",
    "as can be easily seen , this linear regime can be arrived at as a high - temperature expansion of the kramer s type two - state potential studied in @xcite .",
    "as is always true of linear models , ours too would be constrained by the fact that exact measurements of amplitudes of perturbations as well as enacting proper boundary conditions would suffer .",
    "however , the gross aim being a qualitative understanding of the role of noise ( both thermal and non - thermal ) in perturbed membranes , we forego this without any effective loss of generality .",
    "+    our interest is in the activated dynamics of this membrane in the presence of a thermal , together with a non - thermally fluctuating noise .",
    "we define the thermal part of the noise using the standard fd theorem , while the non - thermal part includes a time - decaying component .",
    "the finite decay in the non - thermal noise distribution simply indicates the presence of a finite relaxation time @xmath0 as opposed to a an infinite relaxation time for a white noise source .",
    "one might consider more complicated noise sources as well , like a non - local spatial correlation in its distribution .",
    "we , however , stick to the minimalist model since a spatial non - locality does not change the qualitative outcome , apart from complicating the algebra that is . in the following description , the thermal noise",
    "is represented by @xmath5 and the non - thermal noise by @xmath6 .",
    "the over - damped dynamics of such a membrane ( we consider both 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensional systems individually to illustrate the generality of the argument ) defined by a stiffness @xmath7 , surface tension @xmath8 and mobility @xmath9 is given by    @xmath10    @xmath11 is the space - time dependent external force impressed on this system that , in principle , can be stochastic .",

    "we start from a linearized version of a ( 1 + 1 dimensional ) membrane model driven by a combination of an external time dependent _ non - thermal _ noise @xmath15 and a gaussian thermal noise @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17    where the noises @xmath15 and @xmath16 are defined as follows :    @xmath18    since the thermal and non - thermal noises are uncoupled @xcite ( although not mutually exclusive ; in fact the main aim of our study is to ascertain the dominant mode when both are simultaneously present ) , we will decouple equation ( [ combined ] ) in to separate thermal and non - thermal modes without any loss of generality .",
