    "exclusive vector meson production , especially of heavier quarkonia like @xmath0 or @xmath4 ( or their excited states ) in @xmath5 is generally subjected to pqcd methods .",
    "indeed , the energy dependence of diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons measured at hera , clearly shows the transition from a soft to hard process , when going from light to heavy vector mesons . here , for heavy vector mesons , the energy dependence of the diffractive cross section",
    "is driven by the gluon distribution of the proton . for a comprehensive review ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition to purely elastic case @xmath5 also inelastic @xmath6 processes with a large rapidity gap between the vector meson and the final state inelastic system @xmath7 , were observed in experiments performed at hera @xcite .",
    "these processes also are of a diffractive nature .",
    "it was realized in last years that the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons can be studied also in @xmath8 processes at the lhc , at even higher energies than were available at hera .",
    "due account must then be given to absorptive corrections , and interference effects @xcite .",
    "there has been great interest in the theoretical description of this process .",
    "some authors have suggested to obtain constraints on the collinear glue @xcite , other works are based on the color dipole approach @xcite , on the @xmath9-factorization approach @xcite with the unintegrated gluon distribution as a basic ingredient .",
    "an event generator for central exclusive vector meson production has been recently written @xcite .",
    "first data at the lhc have been obtained by the lhcb collaboration @xcite .",
    "the present experimental apparatus was , however , not sufficient to assure full exclusivity .",
    "so far in experiments performed e.g. by the lhcb collaboration @xcite protons were not measured and only rapidity gaps around vector meson were checked . therefore the discussed semi - exclusive @xmath10 processes may proliferate to the measured cross sections . some , rather technical , methods were proposed how to eliminate them . however , in order to control the situation better one should understand better those processes on theoretical grounds .",
    "in proton - proton collisions two different types of excitation are possible : diffractive as for @xmath6 and electromagnetic in @xmath11 transitions in the vertex with photon exchange .",
    "diffractive excitation of low mass states is dominated by two phenomena @xcite .",
    "firstly , there is the diffractive excitation of positive parity nucleon resonances , a most prominent one being the @xmath12 state .",
    "in addition to the resonance contributions there exists a continuum of @xmath13 states diffractively produced via the drell - hiida - deck mechanism . for a recent consideration of this mechanism at lhc energies , see e.g. the discussion of the @xmath14 reaction in @xcite .",
    "a related hadronic bremsstrahlung mechanism of diffractive production of @xmath15 states has been discussed in @xcite .    a model for the diffractive excitation of low mass states was considered by jenkovszky et al .",
    "@xcite based partially on @xcite in a regge approach . in this approach the resonant contributions dominate .",
    "the large-@xmath16 continuum was considered in the context of @xmath17 reaction . here",
    "perturbative qcd motivated mechanisms , such as those suggested in @xcite contribute to rather large masses of the diffractively produced system . on the experimental side the h1 collaboration at hera found comparable cross section for the dissociative processes in @xmath10 with respect to the elastic process @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath19 diffractive production of @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton collisions was discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered hard pomeron exchange in a leading - logarithmic bfkl approximation .",
    "this process was , however , not discussed there in the context of experimental gaps . in this paper",
    "we will show the dependence on the invariant mass of the diffractively produced system , which is closely related to the rapidity gap starting from the vector meson .",
    "as far as electromagnetic excitations are concerned , to our knowledge only the @xmath20 transition was previously discussed @xcite for associated @xmath0 and @xmath21 production . in general , other resonances as well as continuum production",
    "may also contribute .",
    "recently we proposed an efficient modeling of such processes in dilepton pair production @xcite .",
    "the corresponding inelastic cross sections are expressed there in terms of the @xmath22 structure function . there",
    "exist several practical parametrizations of @xmath22 in different regions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the methods used for @xmath25 production can be applied also to @xmath26 processes discussed here .",
    "preliminary results on the processes with electromagnetic dissociation have been shown in @xcite .",
    "the schematic diagrams of processes considered in this work are shown in fig.[fig : diag_em_exc ] for electromagnetic excitation and in fig.[fig : diag_diff_resonance ] for diffractive excitation . in all cases the final state hadronic system",
    "can be either a proton resonance or a hadronic / partonic continuum .",
    "the details will be given in the following two subsections .",
    "let us first concentrate on the events with electromagnetic dissociation of one of the protons .",
    "the important property of these processes is that the @xmath27 transition is given by the electromagnetic structure functions of the proton , and thus to a large extent calculable `` from data '' .",

    "our recent study @xcite showed , that here it is best to use a parametrization of @xmath22 given in @xcite .",
    "for the cross section @xmath33 we employ a parametrization previously used in @xcite .      in distinction to electromagnetic dissociation , which is essentially calculable from data on the electromagnetic structure functions of a nucleon ,",
    "the diffractive excitation is highly model dependent .",
    "most of the available data were taken at lower energies , see the reviews @xcite , where the exchange of secondary regge trajectories is not negligible .",
    "there are unfortunately very little data that could be used to constrain the model at lhc energies .    in this exploratory study",
    ", we will consider two simple models for the @xmath34 transition .",
    "the first one will describe the resonance region of @xmath35 , and is based on a dual regge approach of @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on a parton model description , where the diffractive vector meson production proceeds on a quark or gluon parton of the proton . here",
    "also large diffractive masses @xmath1 are accessible .",
    "the needed ingredient is the cross section for the diffractive @xmath6 reaction , where we have a large rapidity gap between the vector meson and the other produced particles .",
    "the large gap is provided by the pomeron exchange , and we write the cross section in the form @xmath36 here the first factor derives from the propagator of the effective pomeron , and the constant @xmath37 fixes the normalization . the function @xmath38",

    "its absence on the proton trajectory may be related to its structure .",
