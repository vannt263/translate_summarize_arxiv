    "the central problem of nuclear structure theory is the solution of the many - body schrdinger equation ( mbse ) . for hamiltionans of interest in the nuclear case ,",
    "an analytic solution is impossible , and one is compelled to use some approximation , either in the numerical solution of the equation or the specification of the hamiltonian , or both .    approaching the problem with the aim of using as realistic a representation of the potential as possible usually means fitting a combination of a meson exchange and phenomenological interaction to low - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering data and properties of few - body systems . to get good agreement with experiment both two- and",
    "three - body forces seem to be necessary .",
    "recent examples of such potentials include the bonn @xcite , the argonne two - body @xcite with urbanna 3-body@xcite , nijmegen @xcite and moscow @xcite potentials , the last of which also incorporates quark degrees of freedom .",
    "these forces share the property of having a hard repulsive core which is a natural consequence of meson - exchange .",
    "it is this hard core which presents the difficulty in solving the mbse .",
    "for instance , hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field calculations with such interactions result in unbound nuclei .",
    "treating corrections beyond the hf approximation order - by - order in perturbation theory is also unsuccessful since the interactions used are non - perturbative .",
    "one has to solve the full mbse numerically in as exact a way as possible using techniques such as variational monte - carlo@xcite , green s function monte carlo@xcite , the coupled - cluster method@xcite , and the fermion hyper - netted chain model@xcite . using effective interactions derived from realistic potentials , no - core shell - model calculations have been made in light nuclei@xcite and heavier nuclei close to closed shells have been treated@xcite .",
    "the computational difficulty of performing numerically exact solutions of the mbse has limited the techniques to light nuclei , for instance @xmath2 results have been published recently using the argonne @xmath3 and urbanna ix potentials in the gfmc framework@xcite . in this work",
    ", it is seen that although the lightest nuclei are reproduced very well , the quantitative comparison of theory to data gets worse as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this may be due to the necessarily phenomenological nature of the three  body potential , a problem which may be overcome with re - fitting .",
    "on the other hand , it is not obvious that higher - body forces will not prove necessary or that the concept of a bare interaction between nucleons is valid for small distances .",
    "attempts were made in the late sixties primarily by the kerman group at mit to parameterize the nn interaction in such a way that it is weak in the sense of being perturbative .",
    "such a weak interaction allows one to perform hartree - fock calculations to obtain a reasonable approximation to the full wavefunction and then to calculate corrections in perturbation theory .",
    "while this technique seems very attractive , the result obtained were only moderately successful at reproducing experimental data@xcite , a fact which was presumed to be due to inadequacies in the potentials used .",
    "the efficacy of developing a suitable interaction when similar , though more complicated , techniques were available for realistic interactions has been questioned@xcite and no better interaction was developed .",
    "separable parameterizations , particularly the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction@xcite , have retained currency , as residual interactions @xcite . even when the interactions are too strong for regular perturbation theory , separable interactions requiring solution of brckner hartree - fock equations have proved fruitful@xcite because of their simplicity .    on the other hand ,",
    "interactions have been developed which are not intended for use in the full mbse , but rather to give good results with a hartree - fock calculation alone .",
    "good quantitative success came with the zero - range density - dependent force of ehlers and moszkowski@xcite and skyrme s interaction@xcite , used in hf calculations by vautherin and brink @xcite and subsequently by many others , and also gogny s finite - range interaction@xcite .",
    "skyrme s interaction has been particularly successful , in part due to its simple form , that of a delta function , which leads to easy calculation , even of the exchange part of the force .",
    "this computational simplicity has allowed extensive study of the properties of nuclei to be made with the skyrme interaction across the entire range of nuclei in the periodic table @xcite . related somewhat to the skyrme - hartree - fock model",
    "is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach@xcite , which also gives single - particle motion in a mean field , but as a solution to the dirac equation as opposed to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the rmf approach has some nice features such as the natural occurrence of the spin - orbit splitting without recourse to an assumed spin - orbit interaction .",
    "these mean - field models are inherently single - particle in nature .",
    "the forces used are not intended to be used in the mbse , nor are explicit corrections beyond the mean - field part of the framework , although skyrme s interaction can be considered as a phenomenological g - matrix equivalent@xcite , and in that sense includes a subset of possible correlation effects in the mean - field .",
    "although appropriate for use in mean - field calculations , skyrme s interaction would actually diverge in perturbation theory because of the zero range .",
    "this compels one to use a different interaction to obtain correlation beyond the mean field than was used to create it .",
    "extra residual forces are used , such as pairing@xcite , or shell model interactions@xcite to allow for more general wavefunctions and obtain more accurate reproduction of the physics , or certain approximations are used such as rpa@xcite , which can describe certain observables , particularly those of giant resonance states and other forms of collective motion , but not others .",
    "it is thought that correlations should be particularly important in nuclei at the limits of stability , where the nucleons nearest the fermi level couple strongly to the continuum .",
    "we revisit the idea that it is possible to parameterize a nuclear interaction in such a way that it is weak enough with which to perform perturbation theory , thereby allowing correlated wavefunctions and observables to be calculated across the entire range of nuclei .",
    "using the separable ansatz of previous `` weak '' interactions we have developed a density dependent interaction which we hope will provide some insight into the correlation structure of nuclear wavefunctions while retaining the quantitative power of contemporary effective interactions used in hartree - fock .",
    "in contrast to previous work , the interaction is designed to be an effective interaction with parameters fitted to the properties of finite nuclei within the calculation framework for which it is intended .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review basics of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the separable interaction , used in the present work is given and discussed in section 3 .",
    "results of the calculation for doubly magic nuclei are summarized in section 4 .",
    "derivation of the hf energy and potential is outlined in appendix a.",
    "for standard perturbation theory to be successful , the hamiltonian must be separated into two parts , one which is solvable ( @xmath5 ) , and another which is `` small '' ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for a many - fermion problem in which the particles interact via one- and two - body interactions may be written schematically as @xmath7 typically , the one - body part of the hamiltonian is just the kinetic energy .",
    "this is a unsuitable choice for @xmath5 in the case of nuclei since the eigenstates of this operator , namely plane wave states , are not close enough to the exact eigenstates of the full hamiltonian and @xmath6 is thus not small . by adding and subtracting a one - body term , @xmath8 , of ones choice , the @xmath5 part of the hamiltonian may be solvable to give a wavefunction close to the solution of the full problem , thereby making the corrections from the @xmath6 part small enough for perturbation theory to succeed .",
    "schematically the hamiltonian is now split up into two terms ; @xmath9 one practical choice of @xmath8 is a simple , analytically - solvable external potential , typically  in the nuclear case  of harmonic oscillator or woods - saxon form .",
    "in such a case , all of the physics of the nuclear interaction is in the residual part , @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , for sensible choices of two - body interaction , the residual part of the hamiltonian is non - perturbative in the basis obtained from the solution of the one - body part of the hamiltonian , and one has to perform more exact and exacting interaction shell - model calculations to arrive at a meaningful result .",
    "traditionally , this has involved the diagonalisation of large matrices , or more recently , auxiliary field monte - carlo calculations in the smmc@xcite .",
    "another popular choice for @xmath8 is that of the hartree - fock mean - field .",
    "the hf mean - field potential is usually derived from the full hamiltonian by a variational principle .",
    "viewed in this way , it is the one - body potential whose occupied eigenstates form the lowest energy slater - determinant many - body wavefunction possible for the full many - body hamiltonian .",
    "using such a one - body potential , some physics of the two - body interaction is included in the single - particle problem . with a judicious choice of interaction , one ought to be able to produce very good results , since the approximation of the nucleus as a system of non - interacting particles in a mean - field is known to be a good one . using the hf potential for @xmath8 has the added attraction that it leads to vanishing first order corrections to the energy in perturbation theory . in this case , using wick s theorem@xcite , one can re - write ( [ eq : mbham ] ) as @xmath10 where @xmath5 is the hf mean - field hamiltonian and @xmath6 is the perturbing hamiltonian .",
    "note that @xmath6 is just the full two - body interaction matrix elements with a time - ordered product of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the perturbation series for the energy is ordered by the number of matrix elements of the potential .",
    "usually a diagrammatic representation is used@xcite .",
    "one can write down the number of diagrams for any particular order of perturbation theory .",
    "we have evaluated these for the vacuum amplitude up to order seven .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : numdiags ] .",
    "one sees that , for the method of direct evaluation of diagrams by order to be effective , the series must be sufficiently converged by fourth , or perhaps fifth , order .    in this work ,",
    "the second and third order diagrams for the vacuum amplitude , as shown in figs.[fig : seclab ] and [ fig : thilab ] , are calculated .",
    "their algebraic form is given here as    @xmath11    in which the tildes over the potential indicate the matrix element is antisymmetrized .",
    "the state vectors label hf single - particle states , whose energies are given by the subscripted @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to note that our interaction is not intended to fit scattering data , having , as it does , density dependence . on the level of the perturbation theory it is necessary to treat the density functions as just the spatial form of the interaction , rather than a representation of a many - body force",
    "this is to be considered a part of the present model .",
    "to do otherwise would be to surrender the simplifications our weak , separable potential affords .    in the present work ,",
    "the hartree - fock problem is solved in a basis of spherical harmonic oscillator states .",
    "this yields , along with the hole states , a large number of particle states , with which to directly evaluate the sums of the perturbation series . a sufficient number of states is used so that the particle states are oscillatory over the size of the nucleus and that both the hf solution and the perturbation corrections are reasonably converged .",
    "we have developed an interaction written in the form of a sum of separable terms , which is to say it is in the form @xmath13 .",
    "the functions @xmath14 carry no angular momentum ( @xmath15 ) , and the force is dubbed a monopole - monopole interaction . for future applications",
    ", it is in intended to include higher multipole forces , with @xmath16 , within our framework as these will presumably be necessary for calculation of excited states and deformed nuclei .",
    "although higher multipole forces will contribute to spherical nuclei from the exchange term in hartree fock order and via correlations in perturbation theory , they are not included in the present calculation since it seems unwise to attempt to fit the parameters of such forces to spherical nuclei alone .    in coordinate space ,",
    "the monopole interaction is written as @xmath17 where the function @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19^{-1 } , \\label{3:eq : fdef}\\ ] ] for subscripts @xmath20 and @xmath21 . throughout this work ,",
    "the three terms in ( [ eq : hamil ] ) are referred to , in the order they appear in the above expression , as the attractive , repulsive and derivative terms .",
    "in addition , the spin - orbit force is taken to be @xmath22 which is similar to that used in the modified delta interaction @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are to be fitted to experimental data .",
    "one notices that the two - body interaction consists of a sum of terms , each of which is separable in form and that the expressions for the attractive and repulsive terms in ( [ eq : hamil ] ) differ only by the values of their parameters    the energy , @xmath35 , due to the interaction ( [ eq : hamil ] ) in the hartree - fock approximation is derived in appendix [ chap : hfenergy ] ( [ eq : eatt ] ) , ( [ eq : nonisoen ] ) , ( [ eq : ederv ] ) and is presented here ; @xmath36\\big\\}+\\frac{1}{2}kn_d^2   + cn_w \\label{eq : hfenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the kinetic energy , @xmath38 is the direct coulomb energy plus exchange in the slater approximation .",

    "note that the one - body spin - orbit term could be taken as either a one - body force , or as a one - body potential deriving from a two - body force .",
    "since the latter approach would render the perturbation calculation problematic due to the absence of a suitable of form of the two - body force , we choose the former approach .",
    "hence , since the force is density - dependent , we have also included the rearrangement contribution to the hf potential .",
    "only the non - rearrangement term actually gives rise to the spin - orbit splittings , but the rearrangement terms , coming as they do from a variational principle , result in a lowering of the hf energy . combining the potentials ( [ eq : localpot ] ) , ( [ eq : nonlocpot ] ) and ( [ eq : spinopot ] ) gives us the hf equation @xmath49 in this potential , as well as in the expression for the total energy ( [ eq : hfenergy ] ) , the exchange contribution from the derivative term",
    "is omitted .",
    "while it would , in principle , be desirable to include this term , the calculational complexity involved in doing so has forced the omission in the present case . however , for the main attractive and repulsive terms , the exchange part is much smaller than the direct in all nuclei , and the direct derivative term gives a rather small contribution to the mean - field and the binding energy in comparison to the other direct terms , so it is not considered an unwarranted approximation to neglect the effects of this term .",
    "it might be objected that the form of the interaction is too unrealistic .",
    "for instance , since it is separable it can not satisfy galilean invariance .",
    "furthermore , the unusual form of the isospin operators gives rise to a different effective interaction for protons and neutrons .",
    "as for the second point , since this is a density - dependent interaction , the effect of the difference between neutrons and protons comes from the densities as well as the isospin operators .",
    "this being the case , it seems reasonable to allow for the `` stretching '' of the isospin operator as we have done , to allow greater freedom in fitting the interaction to data . as for the first issue",
    ", the unusual form has been motivated by the desire to keep the force `` weak '' and is justified by the quality of the results produced . a possible method for restoring galilean invariance within our framework",

    "the choice of omitting a spin - spin ( @xmath50 ) type force yet having an isospin - isospin type force is motivated by the nuclei under study .",
    "all the closed - shell nuclei are spin - saturated and would contribute only through the exchange term in the hf order . for this separable interaction ,",
    "the space - exchange terms are rather small and a spin - spin force would add little to the results .",
    "in addition , even if the effects in closed - shell nuclei are important , it does not seem reasonable to fit this term to closed - shell nuclei alone .",
    "it remains an open question whether such a force will prove necessary or useful in open - shell nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to compare the leading terms in the hf mean field to that of other models .",
    "the first line of equation ( [ eq : localpot ] ) gives us this as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a combination of constants .",
    "the product @xmath53 is @xmath54 if @xmath55 then the product @xmath56 is constant and the leading mean field terms go like @xmath57 which , for the special case @xmath58 , are the same as the terms in the skyrme and gogny mean - field proportional to the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which give the bulk of the binding energy and saturation properties . in this work ,",
    "we do not strictly keep @xmath61 , thus allowing for some a - dependence of the coefficients in the mean - field potential .",
    "it has been found , however , that one can not go too far away from the equality and still obtain reasonable results .",
    "that one can get similar results in a mean - field calculation from two very different interactions is reflected in the different constitution of the resulting perturbative part of the hamiltonian , @xmath6 .",
    "in order to find the best set of parameters for the interaction ( [ eq : hamil ] ) , calculations have been made of 14 doubly closed - shell nuclei across the periodic table .",

    "the most obvious exception is @xmath0o which is quite under - bound .",
    "this may be due to the omission of a center - of - mass correction which would undoubtedly go a long way to close the discrepancy in the energy@xcite .",
    "it was not calculated in this case since a rigorous microscopic correction would destroy the mean - field which provides the essential basis for the perturbation calculation .",
    "a phenomenological correction could have been calculated , but perhaps the most suitable method in our framework would be to include with our multipole forces an isoscalar dipole force which could be fitted to restore the translational invariance of the many - body hamiltonian , and evaluated exactly in perturbation theory .    a general trend can be seen in which lighter nuclei are somewhat over - bound and the heaviest are under - bound .",
    "it is the exceptions which conspire to stop the fitting algorithm from doing better , but the somewhat systematic nature of this discrepancy suggests that a better mass or isospin dependence may improve matters .",
    "it is unclear as yet the extent to which multipole correlations or a spin - spin force would improve the fit to spherical nuclei .",

    "this could be remedied by an increase in the spin - orbit coefficient , @xmath34 . in a previous work @xcite , a value 10% higher than ours was used for the same spin - orbit interaction , and",
    "hence the spin - orbit splittings were more realistic .",

    "are dominantly excited to low - lying states above the fermi level .",
    "this results in a ground state with occupation probabilities similar to those which result from pairing forces .",
    "it is also a further indication that perturbation theory makes sense for our interaction since it does not predict excitation of particles in the ground state to extremely high energies .",
    "since the calculations were made only using a monopole force , the correlation structure is not expected to be complete .",
    "only corrections involving simultaneous @xmath15 scattering of two particles is included .",

    "the second order correction in @xmath68ca is much larger than that in @xmath76ca , due to the possibility of an @xmath77 neutron exciting to the @xmath77 proton state while another proton excites to a neutron state .",
    "this extra excitation is the labelled peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : calcorr ] .",
    "as well as having large wavefunction overlaps , the energy denominator in this case is much smaller than in any other possible monopole excitation which must excite any particle across major shells to keep all angular and isospin quantum numbers the same .",
    "when general excitations are permitted by higher multipole forces @xmath85 , this difference between correlations in @xmath80 and @xmath84 nuclei will be smoothed out . for this reason , too , the correlation energies should not be considered too quantitatively at this stage , but rather as an indication of the perturbative properties of the interaction .    comparing the form of the interaction to that of skyrme suggests other possible sources of improvement to the model .",
    "one such may come from a better parameterization of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "a two - body form which fits the philosophy of the separable effective interaction has not been found , but may be necessary to give the correct contribution to the binding energy . in any case , the simple form used in the present work which depends on a radial derivative will need modification if it is to be applied to deformed nuclei .",
    "it may also prove fruitful to explore a more general term dependent upon the derivatives of the density than the single term with parameter @xmath33 , such as is found in the skyrme interaction with two terms proportional to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which often carry further exchange parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we have presented a new effective nuclear interaction which is designed for use in calculations which go beyond the mean - field . the technique of using perturbation theory to build correlations on top of the hartree - fock result is applicable to our interaction and results in small corrections to the single - particle behavior .",
    "a monopole - monopole force alone gives reasonable results for the ground state properties of spherical doubly - magic nuclei .",
    "it is expected that the addition of multipole forces will improve these results , particularly through the completion of the correlation structure .",
    "such multipole forces will also presumably be important in giving the correct shapes of deformed nuclei , which are the subject of a forthcoming study and in the correct description of excited states .",

    "the interaction is given in equation ( [ eq : hamil ] ) .",
    "its expectation value is the contribution it makes to the total energy and is @xmath90    if we consider just the _ attractive _ term - that is , the term whose parameters have the subscript `` a '' - then we will obtain the contribution from the repulsive term by simply substituting the subscript `` a '' for `` r '' .",
    "@xmath91 taking the first line , the matrix element is represented in space ( and spin and isospin ) coordinates ; @xmath92 where quantities defined in section [ sec : interaction ] are used .",
    "note that integrals include sums over spinors and isospinors where appropriate , and the coordinates include spin and isospin coordinates where appropriate .",
    "where densities are used , the summing over isospin states has already been done and where densities do not carry isospin labels , the isoscalar density is assumed .",
    "see equations ( [ eq : den ] ) and ( [ eq : denmat ] ) for definitions .    the second line of ( [ eq : eatt ] )",
    "contains `` isospin - flipping '' operators whose action is to turn an isospin state where particle one is a proton and particle two a neutron , @xmath93 , into @xmath94 and vice - versa .",
    "the direct contribution , in which the labels in the bra and the ket are in the same order is zero since all proton states are orthogonal to all neutron states .",
    "the exchange term is similar to that in ( [ eq : nonisoen ] ) but with different isospin combination of the density matrices ; @xmath95 the third line of [ eq : eatt ] contains isospin - projection operators which have a value @xmath96 when @xmath97 and @xmath98 are like particles and @xmath99 when they are unlike . in the direct term",
    "this gives an energy of @xmath100 ^ 2+\\frac{1}{2}w_af_ab_a\\left[\\int{\\rm        d}^3\\vec{r}\\,\\rho_n(\\vec{r } ) \\rho^{\\beta_a}(\\vec{r})\\right]^2    \\nonumber \\\\    & & -w_af_ab_a\\int{\\rm d}^3\\vec{r}_1\\,\\rho_n(\\vec{r}_1 )    \\rho^{\\beta_a}(\\vec{r}_1 ) \\int{\\rm d}^3\\vec{r}_2\\,\\rho_p(\\vec{r}_2 )    \\rho^{\\beta_a}(\\vec{r}_2)\\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{2}w_af_ab_a\\left[\\int{\\rm d}^3\\vec{r } ( \\rho_p(\\vec{r } ) -      \\rho_n(\\vec{r}))\\rho^{\\beta_a}(\\vec{r } ) \\right]^2 = \\frac{1}{2 } w_a    f_a b_a ( \\delta n_a)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exchange term gives a contribution only when @xmath97 and @xmath98 have the same isospin quantum number , which is just like the case for having no isospin operator there , so the contribution is like that in ( [ eq : nonisoen ] ) @xmath101    the hf mean - field is obtained by varying the total energy with respect to the single particle states .",
    "this gives , for the case of the attractive term , without the explicit isospin dependence : @xmath102 the variation of the function @xmath103 is given by @xmath104^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -f_a^2\\int\\,{\\rm d}^3\\vec{r}\\,\\frac{\\rho^{\\delta    \\alpha_a}(\\vec{r } ) } { \\delta\\phi^*_b(\\vec{x } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -f_a^2\\alpha_a\\int\\,{\\rm d}^3\\vec{r}\\,\\rho^{\\alpha_a-1}(\\vec{r } )    \\frac{\\delta \\rho(\\vec{r})}{\\delta\\phi_b^*(\\vec{x } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -f_a^2\\alpha_a\\rho^{\\alpha_a-1}(\\vec{x})\\phi_b(\\vec{x})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the contributions of the two terms in ( [ eq : varnoniso ] ) involving the variation of @xmath103 give a contribution to the hf mean  field of @xmath105 the function @xmath106 is similar in form to @xmath103 and the functional variation proceeds in a similar manner ; @xmath107 and the contribution from the second term in ( [ eq : varnoniso ] ) to the mean - field is @xmath108 finally , the functional variation of the exchange matrix element @xmath109 is @xmath110 where use is made of the symmetry of the integral to combine the four terms into two . the last term in ( [ eq : varm ] )",
    "gives rise to a local term in the mean - field of @xmath111 where @xmath112 has been defined as in ( [ eq : geez ] ) .",
    "this completes the non - isospin - dependent part of the attractive force , and so also the repulsive by change of subscript .",
    "the isospin - dependent terms are obtained in an analogous way , except that when the variation applies to the density of a single nucleon species , so the contribution to the mean - field applies only to that species .    for the final term in equation ( [ eq : hamil ] ) , the so - called _ derivative _ term ,",
    "only the direct part of the energy is at present considered .",
    "it is @xmath114 the functional variation proceeds as @xmath115 the first term gives a contribution to the mean field of @xmath116 by integrating the second term by parts twice , one in fact gets exactly the same contribution to the mean - field again , so that the total contribution to the mean - field from the direct term of the derivative interaction is @xmath117 the exchange part of this term is not calculated .",
