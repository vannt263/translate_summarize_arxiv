    "<S> . future applications of the demonstrated scheme could range from the search for novel quantum phases in unconventionally shaped lattice potentials up to dissipationless atomic quantum ratchets .    the properties of solid state materials are much determined by the internal spatial structure of its constituents . </S>",
    "<S> most natural solid state materials are crystals , in which the constituents are spatially ordered following the principle of lattice structures . </S>",
    "<S> a large class of different unit cells is known , whose classification into crystal classes , point- and space groups is well established within the field of crystallography @xcite . recently , </S>",
    "<S> artificial crystals of atoms bound by light , so called optical lattices , have developed into model systems for solid state physics problems . in such systems , </S>",
    "<S> effects like bloch - oscillations and the mott - insulator transition were observed @xcite . on the other hand , current quantum gas experiments with optical lattices </S>",
    "<S> have been limited to sinusoidal atom potentials . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical work pointed out that in unconventional lattice structures novel quantum phases are expected @xcite . a possible way to at least in one dimension produce arbitrarily shaped potentials is the use of beams that are inclined under different angles , which may seem impractical and hard to phase stabilize especially if larger numbers of beams are required . </S>",
    "<S> notably , such phase stabilization has recently been achieved for two near - resonant standing waves @xcite . for thermal atoms some nonstandard optical lattices , as subwavelength structure potentials or asymmetric lattices , have been realized with magneto - optical potentials or grey lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these schemes require near - resonant optical radiation whose inherent dissipation impedes the use of quantum degenerate atomic gases . with the so far demonstrated schemes </S>",
    "<S> , the class of realizable lattice potentials furthermore seems limited .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate a scheme to create dissipationless optical lattice potentials with @xmath1 spatial periodicity , which is realized with a fourth - order raman process . building upon this potential , a fourier synthesis of lattice potentials </S>",
    "<S> is demonstrated . by combining the @xmath1 period multiphoton potential with a conventional lattice of @xmath0 spatial periodicity with appropriate phase , an asymmetric lattice with variable asymmetry </S>",
    "<S> is realized . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme for the generation of the @xmath1 period lattice potential is generalizable , in principle , to optical lattice potentials with @xmath2 spatial periodicity , where @xmath3 is an integer number . by diffraction of a rubidium bose - einstein condensate at the optical light shift potential , </S>",
    "<S> absorption images of atom clouds closely connected to the reciprocal lattice of the synthesized potential structures were observed .    in conventional optical lattices with two counterpropagating beams of wavelength @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting optical potential @xmath5 , with @xmath6 as the atomic polarizability , is proportional to @xmath7 , yielding the well - known @xmath0 spatial periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms here undergo virtual two - photon processes of absorption of a photon from one laser beam and stimulated emission into the counterpropagating beam . for a fourier synthesis of arbitrarily shaped potentials , </S>",
    "<S> the required higher harmonics can , in principle , be generated by using a combination of standing waves with wavelengths of the fractional harmonics @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is integer , yielding a lattice potential of spatial period @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a lattice potential of the same periodicity could also be produced , in case each virtual absorption or stimulated cycle could be replaced by a simultaneous process induced by @xmath3 photons of the fundamental wavelength @xmath4 absorbed or emitted along the corresponding direction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) </S>",
    "<S> . the spatial period of this higher order lattice potential can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the effective wavelength of a @xmath3-photon field . </S>",
    "<S> a direct measurement of this effective multiphoton wavelength is in general a very difficult task , as has been discussed in the context of heisenberg - limited measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here use the high frequency resolution of raman transitions between ground state sublevels to separate in frequency space the desired @xmath11-th order process from lower order contributions . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical work has predicted , that a lattice potential of @xmath2 spatial periodicity is indeed expected with this approach @xcite . for early theoretical work analyzing </S>",
    "<S> the use of raman transitions to create optical potentials for atoms , see @xcite . for experimental work on an improved spectral resolution with multiphoton raman transitions , </S>",

    "<S> the scheme uses three - level atoms with two stable ground states @xmath12 and @xmath13 and one electronically excited level @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the four - photon ladder scheme ( right graph of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) , one absorption and one stimulated emission process have been interchanged by a stimulated emission and absorption process of an oppositely directed photon respectively . to avoid second order standing wave processes , a minimum of three laser frequencies is required . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are irradiated with two driving optical fields of frequencies @xmath15 from the left and one field with frequency @xmath16 from the right . </S>",

    "<S> the depth of the optical potential is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) are the rabi frequencies for the transitions @xmath26 and @xmath27 driven by the light fields with frequency @xmath28 and @xmath16 ( @xmath16 and @xmath29 ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> further , @xmath30 denotes the optical detuning from the excited atomic level @xmath14 , which with @xmath31 is here assumed to be identical for all three optical frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that the four - photon energy shift is not proportional to @xmath32 , i.e.  the effect does not originate from the nonlinearity of the multiphoton transitions @xcite . in an atom optics picture , </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath1 spatial periodicity can be understood by considering the momentum transfer to an atom during virtual four - photon cycles of alternating absorption and stimulated emission which is @xmath33 , being a factor 2 above the corresponding processes in a standing laser wave . by combining lattice potentials of different spatial periodicities , in principle , </S>",

    "<S> the emitted radiation is split into two beams ( beam1 , beam2 ) , from which , after passing independent aousto - optical modulators ( aom1 , aom2 ) , the two counterpropagating beams realizing the lattice potentials are derived . </S>",
    "<S> the aoms are used for switching of the optical fields and in the case of beam2 , to superimpose several optical frequency components onto a single beam path . to generate the rf drive signals for the aoms , we use a set of four phase - locked function generators . </S>",
    "<S> while aom1 is driven with a single radio frequency , for aom2 , the radio frequency signals of three function generators are combined . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the three different optical frequencies required to synthesize the asymmetric lattice can be generated in beam2 . </S>",

    "<S> the optical lattice beams are inclined under an angle of 41@xmath36 respectively to the horizontally orientated co@xmath34-laser trapping beam .    </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath37rb bec is produced all - optically by evaporative cooling in a tightly focused co@xmath34-laser beam operating near a wavelength of 10.6@xmath35 m , as described in detail in @xcite . by activating a magnetic gradient field during the evaporation phase </S>",
    "<S> , a spin - polarized condensate with approximately 10,000 atoms in the @xmath38 zeeman state of the @xmath39 ground state is produced . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic bias field generates a frequency splitting @xmath40khz between neighboring zeeman ground states of the rubidium atoms . for a typical optical frequency difference @xmath41khz </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at a raman detuning @xmath42khz . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic bias field forms an angle with respect to the optical beam axis , so that the atoms experience both @xmath43 , @xmath44 , as well as @xmath45 polarizations . to realize the multiphoton lattice as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b , we use the @xmath39 ground state levels @xmath38 and @xmath46 as states @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively and the @xmath47 manifold as the electronically excited state @xmath14 . since the lattice beam detuning is orders of magnitude larger than the upper state hyperfine structure splitting , raman transitions only couple neighboring ground state zeeman levels . for alkali atoms , </S>",
    "<S> the raman lattice detuning is limited to a value of order of the excited state fine structure splitting ( @xmath4815 nm for rb , 34 nm for cs ) , which for these atoms for typical parameters limits the expected coherence time of the multiphoton lattice to a value of order of a second due to photon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> longer coherence times should be possible e.g.  with the use of metastable p - triplett states of two - electron atoms , as e.g.  the @xmath49 state in atomic ytterbium with 17s life time , an atom with which bec has recently been achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after the generation of the bec , the lattice beams are activated for a period @xmath506@xmath35s . to read out the spatially varying potential of the multiphoton lattice , we study the far - field diffraction pattern of the imprinted phase grating after a free falling time of 10  ms . from the measured diffraction patterns </S>",
    "<S> , we can reconstruct the optical potential .    as is well known from crystal structure analysis , measurements of the intensity of a scattered or diffracted beam , </S>",
    "<S> do not in general allow one to reconstruct the lattice structure , as is known as the phase problem . </S>",
    "<S> for many special cases , a reconstruction is however possible @xcite . in our experiment , assuming that the one - dimensional lattice is invariant to spatial translations of @xmath0 , the reciprocal lattice is limited to the harmonics @xmath2 and it is straightforward to show that a measurement of the atom diffraction pattern @xmath51 allows one to reconstruct the spatial lattice structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we have fitted the result of a numerical solution of the time - dependent , momentum - picture schrdinger equation to our experimental far - field diffraction data . </S>",
    "<S> the used hamiltonian was @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . for known phase @xmath54 and pulse length @xmath55 , the potential depths @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the two- and four - photon lattice components were left as free parameters and could thus be determined from the fit . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we found no major difference between these results and an analytical solution for the atomic diffraction pattern obtained using the simple thin grating ( raman - nath ) approximation ( roughly below 20% difference ) . in the raman - nath approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy in the hamiltonian is neglected , which requires ( 1 ) @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the recoil frequency , and ( 2 ) @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the oscillation period @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first condition is fulfilled in our experiment , whereas the second is not . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the numerical solution and the predictions in the raman - nath approximation is due to the neglect of the center - of - mass motion in this approximation .    within the raman - nath regime , </S>",
    "<S> a quite intuitive connection between the lattice structure and its far - field diffraction pattern is possible . </S>",
    "<S> a bec with initially homogeneous phase here accumulates a spatially varying phase shift @xmath62 , and one finds that the far - field momentum distribution is @xmath63 , where ft denotes the fourier transform with respect to @xmath64 @xcite . for small pulse envelopes , </S>",
    "<S> in which the exponential factor can be linearized , the time of flight image is directly related to the fourier transform of the potential @xmath65 , i.e.  the reciprocal lattice . within second order we find @xmath66 , which allows us to express the probability to find an atom in @xmath67 .  </S>",
