    "the reduced cross sections appear in a number of real world situations .",
    "for example , they affect electromagnetic showers produced by very high energy cosmic rays .    in crystals , the long formation length allows pair conversion amplitudes from regularly spaced atoms to add coherently .",
    "the strong magnetic fields can greatly increase the pair production cross section .",

    "this is the complete screening limit ; at distances larger than @xmath39 , the electrons screen the nuclear charge . in this limit",
    ", the cross section for pair production is independent of @xmath21 . for heavy ions ( heavier than iron ) ,",
    "the limit is reached within 1% for @xmath40 gev ; for lighter ions , higher photon energies are required . for hydrogen ,",
    "the finite - energy correction is still slightly larger than 1% for @xmath41 gev @xcite .",
    "for light ions , the radiation length @xmath2 scales as 1/@xmath42 - the interaction amplitude depends on @xmath43 , and the cross section on @xmath42 .",
    "however , as @xmath43 rises , higher order diagrams with multiple photons may be important .",
    "the most important ( largest ) higher order terms account for the fact that the pair is produced in the potential well of the target nucleus ; the other terms , due to fluctuations in the incoming photon , are small .",
    "bethe and maximon calculated the corrections due to the potential by solving exactly the dirac equation for an electron in a coulomb field @xcite .",

    ", these cross sections agree with the data to within 2% @xcite .    at very high energies , other channels may contribute to the cross section .",
    "for example , the virtual photon in fig . [ fig : scheme ] can be replaced with a virtual @xmath53 boson .",
    "although the amplitude for the @xmath53 mediated reaction is not large , the interference with the purely electromagnetic process can introduce @xmath54 asymmetries between the electron and the positron , especially for large @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "there is a paucity of data on pair production from photons with @xmath40 gev .",
    "the high - energy frontier has moved to @xmath35 and hadron colliders , as will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "there is been considerable data on pair production in crystals , but the effects of the crystal overshadow any subtleties in the individual photon - atom interactions ; crystals are discussed in section [ s : fields ] .",
    "as the photon energy rises , the formation length becomes large enough that it encompasses more than one atom .",
    "then , the amplitudes for interacting with multiple atoms must be added , and interference between interactions with different atoms needs to be considered .",
    "landau and pomeranchuk considered this problem in 1953 @xcite .",
    "they used classical electrodynamics to study bremsstrahlung .",

    "the phase coherence holds for shorter and shorter distances as the multiple scattering increased . for energetic electrons radiating low energy photons ,",
    "the reduction in coherence reduces the total emission .",
    "the conditions for reduced emission can be estimated from the multiple scattering in a formation length . when the multiple scattering angle within @xmath24 is larger than @xmath63 , then the multiple scattering reduces the coherence , and , with it , the radiation . in a distance @xmath24 ,",
    "the mean multiple scattering angle is @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 mev .",
    "an additional multiplicative term , @xmath73 is sometimes included to account for the non - gaussian nature of coulomb scattering .",
    "this non - gaussian nature is particularly apparent for thin targets , where the number of scatters is small .",

    "this is not surprising ; the larger @xmath55 , the shorter @xmath97 ( eq . [ eq : lf0 ] ) , and the less of an opportunity for multiple scattering to contribute to @xmath22 .    while the pair production cross section falls at high energies , the photonuclear cross section rises .",
    "photonuclear interactions occur when the photon fluctuates into a quark - antiquark ( @xmath98 ) pair , which then interacts hadronically with a target nucleus .",

    "any estimate in this energy range requires a large extrapolation , so there is considerable uncertainty . the energy - dependence in ref .",
    "@xcite is reasonably conservative .",
    "there are also significant uncertainties in the pair production cross section .",
    "the cross section calculations may fail when the suppression becomes very large ( order of @xmath106 ) .",
    "when lpm suppression is very large , higher - order reactions such as @xmath107 are more important . with their larger inherent @xmath22 , these reactions are less affected by by multiple scattering .    with these caveats , for both materials the photonuclear cross sections are larger than the pair production cross sections for @xmath108 ev .",
    "the crossover energy is similar for both materials . for lighter materials ,",
    "@xmath109 is larger , while for heavier materials , lpm suppression is larger .",
    "the two effects largely cancel out .",
    "even with the uncertainties , the trend is clear : at very high energies , photonuclear interactions become more important , and may even dominate over pair production . even at a few @xmath110 ev , electromagnetic showers may develop significant hadronic components , complicating their identification .",
    "production of @xmath111 and @xmath112 pairs , @xmath113 is reduced by a factor @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the lepton mass .",
    "so , neither process is very important here .",
    "of course , in some parts of phase space ( such as for high mass pairs ) , the suppression is smaller .",
    "one other suppression mechanism should be mentioned : bremsstrahlung can also suppress pair production @xcite .",
    "a produced leptons can emit a bremsstrahlung photon and lose momentum .",
    "when the bremsstrahlung occurs in the pair production formation zone , the combined reaction is a single , higher - order process .",

    "including lpm suppression , @xmath116 when @xmath117 , or , for lead , @xmath118 ev .",
    "this is only approximate ; while bremsstrahlung suppresses pair production , the reverse is also true : pair production suppresses bremsstrahlung .",
    "the suppression of one reaction reduces its impact on the other reaction @xcite and a combined calculation is needed to properly understand pair production and bremsstrahlung in this energy regime .",
    "the energies required to study lpm suppression of pair production are well beyond the reach of existing accelerators .",
    "however , lpm suppression is important to studies of very high energy cosmic rays ( including neutrinos ) .",
    "when high energy cosmic rays hit the atmosphere , they interact , forming air showers which develop into billions of lower energy particles . cosmic rays with energies up to @xmath119 ev have been observed @xcite .",
    "if the incident particles are photons ( unlikely , as discussed in section [ s : fields ] ) , then lpm suppression reduces the cross sections and thereby lengthens the shower , increasing the amount of energy that reaches the ground .",
    "proton induced showers are much less affected , but still have an electromagnetic component that is subject to the lpm effect .",
    "however , the suppression is only relevant for the highest energy showers @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ ss : experiment ] , cosmic ray showers have been used to study the lpm effect .",
    "very high energy cosmic ray @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 may be visible at next generation neutrino detectors , like icecube @xcite .",
    "neutrino interactions produce high energy leptons along with hadronic showers from the struck nucleus .",
    "@xmath120 showers are most affected by the lpm effect , because of the very high energy electron .",
    "however , electrons from @xmath123 decay and the electromagnetic component of the hadronic shower may also be affected by lpm suppression .      in very thin targets ,",
    "the formation length may be larger than the target thickness @xmath124 .",
    "when this occurs , the target interacts as a single unit . including lpm suppression , @xmath125 when @xmath126 when @xmath125 , lpm suppression may be less than in a very thick target .    for very thin targets ,",
    "the multiple scattering in the target is negligible , and the bethe - maximon cross section is retained , independent of @xmath21 .",

    "the results are almost identical to migdals . with a slowly varying @xmath175 to model coulomb scattering , the zakharov cross section has more energy dependence than migdals @xmath147 . at higher energies ,",
    "zakharov should find slightly lower cross sections than migdal .    for regimes with moderate suppression , zakharov adopted a more accurate coulomb potential than a dipole , with separate potentials for the nucleus and it s electrons .",
    "this separation is important for low-@xmath43 atoms where the electrons play a significant role @xcite . with these details",
    ", zakharov found a good fit to the slac e-146 data , except for the carbon .",
    "v. n. baier and v. m. katkov made one of the few explicit calculations of pair production @xcite .",
    "the framework was similar to migdal , but with a quasiclassical eikonal approximation for the scattering .",
    "this quasiclassical approach has been criticized as being inapplicable in the regime where it was used because the electron impact parameter can not be treated classically @xcite .",
    "however , baier and katkov argue that , when the angular momentum is large , their approach is acceptable @xcite .",
    "the eikonal approach allowed them to include coulomb corrections in the potential , an important factor in improving the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "they included a separate term in the potential to account for scattering from the atomic electrons .",
    "in the no - suppression limit , the authors obtain the fully - screened bethe - maximon coulomb - corrected cross sections .",
    "baier and katkov note that , for heavy elements , the coulomb correction is larger than the uncertainties in the slac e-146 data @xcite .",
    "the e-146 experimental analysis normalized the migdal calculations ( without radiative corrections ) to a radiation length that included coulomb corrections , effectively multiplying the two effects together .",
    "this was the limit of the then - current technology .",
    "although the results matched the data , this may not have been an optimal approach .",
    "when the suppression is strong , baier and katkov give a polynomial expression for the total pair production cross section @xmath176 \\label{eq : bk}\\ ] ] where @xmath177 , with @xmath178 from eq .",

    "[ eq : bk ] reduces the cross section at moderate photon energies .",
    "however , at large enough energies , the polynomial terms drop out , but the last correction term in eq . [",
    "eq : bk ] increases the cross section to 2 - 10% above the migdal result .",
    "suppression of pair production can only be observed for photon energies @xmath180 . since @xmath1811 tev , even for the densest materials",
    ", it has not been possible to study this suppression at accelerators .",
    "some studies have used cosmic rays , but the statistics are limited by the high energy cosmic ray flux .",
    "the earliest studies considered low - energy electrons in photon induced showers .",
    "fowler , perkins and pinau studied 47 electromagnetic showers with an energy above 1 tev in an emulsion stack , measuring the distance between the initial conversion point and the first daughter pair downstream of the primary @xcite . at high photon energies ,",
    "the average distance rose , as expected for decreasing cross sections .",
    "the statistics were limited because few sufficiently energetic photons penetrate the atmosphere . to improve the statistics , some later experiments flew emulsion detectors in high - altitude balloons @xcite , where the flux of high - energy photons is higher .",
    "they achieved somewhat better statistics , but with qualitatively similar results .",
    "one of the most precise studies was by kasahara in 1985 @xcite .",
    "he studied the development of electromagnetic showers with energies of order 100 tev , in lead - emulsion chambers . at these energies ,",
    "lpm suppression significantly increases the penetration depth of the showers .",
    "after removing the contamination from hadronic showers , kasahara found that the shower profiles were consistent with migdals cross sections , but not the bethe - heitler formulae .    because of the limited statistics possible in cosmic ray studies , the best studies of the lpm effect have used accelerators to study the suppression of bremsstrahlung .",
    "bremsstrahlung can be studied with electron beams with energies @xmath182 , as long as photons with energies @xmath183 are studied .",
    "the first accelerator experiment used 40 gev electrons generated from 70 gev protons at the serpukhov u-70 accelerator @xcite .",
    "bremsstrahlung photons from carbon , aluminum , lead and tungsten targets were detected in a sodium - iodide calorimeter .",
    "the electrons were bent away from the calorimeter with a magnet .",
    "the group studied photons with energies between 20 and 80 mev . at higher photon energies ,",
    "the lpm effect was unimportant , while at lower energies , the backgrounds were very high . even in the signal region , there were significant backgrounds from bremsstrahlung in air and scintillation counters , and muon contamination in the beam . by taking ratios of their data ( lead / aluminum and tungsten / carbon )",
    ", they were able to estimate the degree of suppression .",
    "they found suppression larger than migdal predicted , albeit with large errors .",
    "a later experiment at the stanford linear accelerator center , slac experiment e-146 , made precise measurements of bremsstrahlung from 7 targets , from carbon to uranium , in beams of 8 and 25 gev electrons @xcite .",
    "they studied photons with energies between 200 kev and 500 mev .",
    "the photons were detected in a position - sensitive segmented bgo calorimeter 50 meters away from the target . the small solid angle and position sensitivity helped reduce backgrounds , especially from synchrotron radiation .",
    "data was taken at 2 different settings of calorimeter gain ( i.e. photomultiplier tube high voltage ) to maximize the dynamic range .",
    "the electron beam - line was kept entirely in vacuum to eliminate bremsstrahlung from air or target windows .",
    "the group used a tertiary electron beam , but , because the primary beam was also electrons , beam contamination was small .",
    "the beam was usually run at an average of 1 electron per pulse , 120 pulses / second ; events containing zero or multiple electrons were rejected during analysis .",
    "the calorimeter was calibrated using cosmic rays and a 500 mev electron beam .",
    "the group also used the downstream magnet for an electron spectrometer , measuring the electron energy loss .",
    "because of the limited resolution for electron energy loss , this was useful only as a check .",
    "figure [ e146al ] shows the e-146 data for the aluminum targets .",
    "targets with thicknesses of 3% and 6% of @xmath2 ( 3.12 mm and 5.3 mm ) were used .",
    "events containing a single electron were selected , and the photon energy spectrum measured .",
    "the photon energy is plotted in logarithmic width bins , with 25 bins per decade of energy .",
    "then , the approximate bethe - heitler photon spectrum @xmath184 transforms to @xmath185 - a straight line .",
    "the probability for a single electron to undergo two independent interactions in the target tilts the spectra slightly .",
    "this was dealt with by using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the data shows significant suppression . for @xmath186 ,",
    "an additional suppression mechanism is required to explain the data .",
    "this second mechanism involves the produced photon , which also interacts with the medium , through forward compton scattering .",
    "classically , this is described via a dielectric constant @xmath187 .",
    "the group has also studied thin targets , where @xmath188 for relevant photon energies . for thin targets , the radiation was above the migdal calculation , and consistent with the calculations that treated the entire target as a single radiator .",
    "more recently , an aarhus - cern - florence - free university , amsterdam - cape town collaboration studied bremsstrahlung from 149 - 287 gev electrons from iridium , tungsten and tantalum targets @xcite .",
    "they used a cern test beam .",
    "figure [ fig : cern ] shows their tantalum target data plotted in a manner similar to the e-146 data . with the higher electron energies , they observed suppression up to @xmath189 , a significant fraction of the spectrum .",
    "the goal of this experiment was to directly observe the overall increase in radiation length as the radiation decreases .",
    "they observed roughly a 30% decrease in radiation at the highest electron energy , consistent with expectations from migdals calculation .",
    "the collaboration fitted their spectra to measure @xmath90 for their targets @xcite . for the densest target , iridium , their measured @xmath90 averaged @xmath190 tev , in quite good agreement with the theoretical prediction of 2.25 tev .",
    "however , for the lighter targets , tantalum and copper , the measured @xmath90 were considerably below the expected values - by 40% for copper .",
    "the reasons for the difference are not clear , but the collaboration suggests that possibly bremsstrahlung from atomic electrons could be unsuppressed .",
    "the experiment also uses data from a carbon target for a normalization spectrum ; if the carbon spectra were somehow compromised , this data could affect their measured @xmath90 .",
    "it may be worth noting that the e-146 carbon - target data is poorly described by calculations based on migdals work .",
    "over 50 years ago , h. robl noted that for very high energy photons , matter is not necessary for pair production : even static electromagnetic fields suffice @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the photon conversion depends on the parameter @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the magnetic field perpendicular to the photon direction and @xmath193 gauss is the critical field .",
    "the probability of photon survival for a distance @xmath194 is @xmath195 where @xcite @xmath196 and @xmath197 is a modified bessel function and @xmath198 fm is the compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "this equation is for the constant field approximation , and may fail for rapidly varying fields .",
    "figure [ fig : bconvert ] shows the attenuation coefficient @xmath39 for photons of different energies .",
    "the absorption is small for @xmath199 , or @xmath200 . in this limit @xmath201 .",
    "the absorption rises sharply as a function of @xmath21 for @xmath202 , reaching a peak for @xmath203 . at this maximum , @xmath204 . as @xmath205 continues to rise , the attenuation coefficient drops slowly ; for @xmath206 , @xmath207 . the attentuation increases with increasing @xmath192 , but , for fixed @xmath192 , drops slowly as @xmath21 rises .    there are some minor discrepancies between various studies .",

    ".    the momentum transfer to the field required for pair production is the same as for an atomic target , eq [ eq : qperp0 ] .",
    "additional terms are required to account for the magnetic bending which , like multiple scattering , reduces the electron and positron longitudinal velocity .",
    "the field bends electrons smoothly , with @xmath211 in contrast to the @xmath212 found for multiple scattering . including the magnetic bending for the electron ( @xmath213 ) and positron ( @xmath214 ) , the longitudinal momentum transfer is @xmath215 this leads to a a quartic equation for @xmath24 . at low photon energies ,",
    "magnetic bending is small and @xmath24 rises linearly with @xmath21 .",
    "it reaches a maximum , and then decreases . for @xmath216 , @xmath217 so @xmath218 -",
    "the same scaling found from the more detailed calculations .",
    "since @xmath219 is so large , this process is only important for photons with quite high energies .",
    "in fact , conversion in an external magnetic field has not been observed .",
    "however , it does have important astrophysical applications .",
    "one example involves very high energy cosmic rays .",
    "very high energy photons may pair convert in the earth s magnetic field @xcite . for a @xmath220 ev photon perpendicular to the earth s field",
    ", the attenuation length is about 100 km .",
    "the earth s magnetic field extends to altitudes of 1000 s of kilometers , far above the atmosphere where lower energy showers originate .",
    "the produced electrons interact with the earth s magnetic field and emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "the combination of pair production in the field and synchrotron radiation leads to an electromagnetic shower , even in the absence of matter .",
    "the field - induced shower largely stops developing when the average particle energy drops so that @xmath221 ( @xmath222 ev ) .",
    "the produced particles propagate downward until they reach the atmosphere , where the shower develops conventionally .",
    "the initial high - altitude reactions gives these showers a head - start .",
    "this early development is helpful in differentiating photon initiate showers from proton initiated showers .",
    "only a handful of showers with energies above @xmath223 ev have been observed , but the primary particles can not all be photons @xcite .",
    "pair conversion can also occur in the strong magnetic fields that surround many astrophysical objects .",
    "for example , many neutron stars support surface magnetic fields around @xmath224 g. in these fields pair conversion occurs quickly for @xmath225 mev .",
    "although pair conversion from an external magnetic field has not been seen in the laboratory , a fairly close analog has been studied : pair conversion in crystals .",
    "when a photon traverses a crystal parallel to one of the axes , the magnetic fields of the individual atoms add together to act as a single , extremely strong field .",
    "the effective fields are largest when the photon direction is well aligned with a crystal axis , within a characteristic angle given by the atomic lattice spacing divided by the formation length . for 100 gev photons",
    ", this angle is a few mrad .",
    "often , the target is mounted in a goniometer which allowed precise adjustments of the crystal orientation .",
    "pair conversion is studied as the crystal orientation is varied ; when the axis is properly aligned , pair production is enhanced @xcite .",
    "two factors affect the enhancement . impurities and other lattice defects lead to uneven atom spacings which reduce the coherence ; high quality crystals are required .",
    "the quality requirement limits the choice of target material . at the highest photon energies , variations in atomic spacing due to lattice vibrations limit the coherence .",
    "sometimes , crystals are cooled to reduce these vibrations .",
    "the second factor is the divergence ( angular size ) of the photon beam . in a beam with a large divergence",
    ", many photons will not be within the characteristic angle of the crystal axis .",
    "the simplest manifestation of the strong coherent fields is channelling ; charged particles in crystals may be strongly deflected . channeling studies",
    "show that the effective fields can reach 25 megagauss in silicon crystals @xcite .",
    "crystal channeling can in some cases supplant conventional accelerator magnets , particularly for beam extraction @xcite .    with the increased bending , production of bremsstrahlung photons",
    "is also greatly enhanced .",
    "this technique is mature enough that plans are advanced to use coherent bremsstrahlung in a diamond crystal to generate high - energy polarized photon beams for a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "the fields can also cause photon conversions . at cern ,",
    "pair conversion in germanium , tungsten and iridium crystals has been studied with photons with energies up to 150 gev .",
    "the pair production cross section was enhanced over the isolated atom bethe - heitler prediction ; the enhancement grew linearly with energy , reaching a factor of 7 for @xmath226 gev @xcite .",
    "the total and differential ( with respect to @xmath170 ) cross sections agreed with the predictions for coherent enhancement .",
    "when a magnetic field also contains matter , both fields must be considered together .",
    "the effects of the nuclei and the fields must be combined to find the conversion probability .",
    "this is a complex calculation . here",
    "we examine one limit , the reduction in pair conversion on a target due to the motion caused by a moderate ( @xmath227 ) magnetic field . here",
    ", the magnetic field plays a similar role to multiple scattering .",
    "when the magnetic bending terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : qpb ] dominate , the magnetic field suppresses the bremsstrahlung .",
    "the suppression equation is quartic , and , in the limit of strong suppression , the cross section is @xcite @xmath228 where @xmath229 plays a similar role to @xmath90 .",
    "this approach only applies for very high energy photons in relatively low - density matter . at high densities , lpm suppression dominates .",
    "when @xmath230 , pair conversion in the magnetic field is important .",
    "a parallel analysis finds a similar suppression for bremsstrahlung .",
    "the bremsstrahlung calculation is supported by detailed calculation using kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "pair production also occurs at particle colliders . the colliding particles each emit a photon ; the two photons collide to form an @xmath35 or other lepton pair .",
    "lepton pair production at @xmath35 colliders has been studied intensely over the past 30 years .",
    "these studies have been used for a variety of tests of qed @xcite .",
    "the reactions have also been studied as backgrounds to other interesting processes , especially those that are beyond the standard model .",
    "they are also used to measure the internal ( electromagnetic ) structure of the photon @xcite .    although these processes follow the same diagrams as pair production , fig .",
    "1 , there are some significant differences from the fixed target regime .",
    "the reaction @xmath31 , studied at @xmath35 colliders , involves many more diagrams than appear in fig .",
    "second , the photons are virtual . for @xmath35 colliders , and @xmath231 colliders ,",
    "the virtuality ( effective mass ) is large , while in proton and ion colliders it is smaller .",
    "this review will focus on photoproduction with almost - real photons ( those with small virtuality ) at @xmath231 , @xmath232/@xmath233 and heavy ion colliders . finally , the symmetric initial state leads to some interesting effects .",
    "there is a vast literature on photoproduction at colliders ; here we only consider a few selected examples to illustrate the similarities and differences with fixed target reactions .",
    "muon and electron pair production , @xmath234 and @xmath235 were studied by the h1 collaboration at the hera @xmath231 collider @xcite .",
    "they observed lepton pairs with masses up to 80 gev , where electroweak corrections to qed are significant .",
    "the study was done to search for physics beyond the standard model , but the collaboration found good agreement with the standard model .    in colliders , the ions are fully stripped of electrons .",
    "there is no screening , and , as the beam energy rises , photoproduction occurs at larger and larger impact parameters .",
    "consequently , the cross section continues to rise with energy indefinitely .",
    "for example , in gold on gold collisions at a center of mass energy of 200 gev per nucleon at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider , the cross section is expected to be 33,000 barns , rising to 200,000 barns in 5.5 tev per nucleon lead on lead collisions at cern s large hadron collider @xcite .",
    "pair production can occur at ion - ion separations up to several @xmath236 m .    because @xmath237 , higher order corrections to the cross section could be large , and pair production may probe non - perturbative strong - field qed .",
    "this possibility encouraged many theoretical efforts .",
    "one approach extended the bethe - maximon approach to collisions of heavy ions .",
    "the effect of the coulomb potentials of both ions was to reduce the cross section by 25% at rhic and 14% at the lhc @xcite .",
    "tony baltz made an all - orders calculation of pair production in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "he found an exact solution to the time - dependent dirac equation @xcite . in an appropriate gauge ,",
    "the coulomb potential from an ultra - relativistic particle simplifies into a simple two - dimensional potential , and pair production can be calculated exactly .",
    "surprisingly , his results matched the lowest order perturbative result @xcite , without any coulomb corrections .",
    "however , a later , more careful calculation found results that included the coulomb corrections @xcite .",
    "the theoretical issues are discussed elsewhere in this volume , so they will not be considered further here .    in most existing data on @xmath35 production in ion collisions , at least one of the ions is light ( typically sulfur ) .",
    "experiment na-45 at the cern sps studied 200 gev per nucleon bare sulfur ions hitting a platinum target and found cross sections consistent with the lowest order perturbative result @xcite .",
    "the measured cross section in a restricted kinematic region is @xmath238 of that expected from lowest order qed . here",
    ", the errors are combined in quadrature .",
    "this result could be used to put limits on some models of radiative corrections .",
    "other sps studies found similar results , with general agreement to lowest order calculations @xcite .    at ion colliders ,",
    "the charges are large enough that multiple interactions between a single ion pair are very possible .",
    "for example , two pairs may be created by a single ion - ion reaction @xcite .",
    "multiple pairs have not been studied yet . however , the star collaboration has studied @xmath35 pair production accompanied by mutual coulomb dissociation of the two nuclei @xcite .",
    "the mutual coulomb dissociation criteria selects collisions where the impact parameter is less than about 30 fm , considerably smaller than for unselected pair production .",
    "the reduction in impact parameter leads to stronger colliding fields , and therefore to increased higher order corrections . despite this",
    ", the collaboration found that their results were well described by lowest order qed .",
    "they did find that it was necessary to include the photon virtuality in the calculation to explain the @xmath239 spectrum of the pair .",
    "multiple interactions are most common at small impact parameters , where the field densities are strongest . for this reason ,",
    "they are a good place to search for higher order effects . despite this ,",
    "the star data are consistent with lowest order qed . because of the restricted impact parameter range",
    ", this data can not be directly compared with existing studies of radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the absence of atomic electrons allows some new reactions , such as pair production with capture , where an electron is produced bound to one of the participating nuclei .",
    "this reaction has a number of notable applications , most notably the first production of antihydrogen .",
    "antihydrogen is produced when positrons were produced via pair production , bound to antiprotons @xcite . at heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the cross section for electron capture is sizable , of the order of 100 - 200 barns at rhic and the lhc @xcite .",
    "the single - electron atoms are lost from the colliding beams , reducing the luminosity , and giving pair production some importance for accelerator design .",
    "pair production at high energies covers a varied palette of physics .",
    "high mass pairs have been a sensitive test of qed , and pair production at @xmath35 and @xmath231 colliders continues to be a laboratory to search for new physics .",
    "these colliders allow the highest energy tests of qed .",
    "lower mass pairs have long formation lengths .",
    "these reactions are distributed over many atoms , and probe bulk characteristics of the material . when the photon energy is large enough",
    ", pair production is suppressed below the bethe - heitler cross section , and many ` obvious ' scaling laws fail . at very high photon energies ,",
    "the pair production cross section may be smaller than the photonuclear cross section , and photonic showers will look like hadronic showers .",
