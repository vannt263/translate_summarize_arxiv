    "in present paper , the transport of a brownian particle moving in spatially asymmetric potential in the presence of asymmetric unbiased fluctuations is investigated . in contradiction with the previous findings ,",
    "our results show that the mutual interplay between asymmetry of fluctuation and asymmetry of potential may cause an optimized efficiency of energy conversion .",
