    "the @xmath0 string theory ( see e.g.  @xcite for review ) is probably the simplest non - trivial representative in the vast hierarchy of string theories .",
    "although it lacks many properties of its siblings , it is still non - trivial example , admitting interesting space - time physics .",
    "it offers therefore very useful and already standard laboratory for studies of general properties of string theories : open - closed string dualities , d - branes , tachyon condensation , as well as those phenomena , which are still hard to describe in higher - dimensional string theories ( such as e.g. black hole formation ) .",
    "the latter problem is of the special interest , because two - dimensional string theory is likely to be the first model of black hole  @xcite which can be elaborated to such an extent , that it would address all important questions of black hole physics , from the initial formation to the description of final stage of hawking evaporation ( fully taking into account quantum backreaction ) .",
    "initial progress in @xmath0 string theory was made in the early 90s ( see reviews  @xcite ) when its `` dual description '' in terms of the so - called @xmath0 _ matrix quantum mechanics _",
    "( mqm ) was found and the detailed correspondence between perturbative string theory and matrix model was developed .",
    "this allowed to use matrix model techniques for computations of the string theory correlators in a way alternative to the liouville theory and provided non - trivial cross - check .",
    "space - time string field theory was developed  @xcite .",
    "the integrable structure of mqm allows to solve the @xmath0 string theory in the large class of non - trivial backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest to the correspondence between @xmath0 string theory and mqm was revitalized .",
    "introduction of the d - branes as well as the progress in the boundary liouville cft  @xcite allowed for a new understanding of the tachyon condensation and open - closed string duality ( for a recent review see e.g.  @xcite ) and helped to extend the connections between mqm and string theory to the new non - perturbative effects  @xcite .    despite of all this progress and apparent simplicity of the model ,",
    "the problem of black hole is still unsolved  @xcite .",
    "this may imply that some important ingredients are missing in usual set up of @xmath0 string theory .",
    "that is one reason why it is interesting to consider some generalization of the above construction . in this paper",
    "we will consider such a generalization which can be both helpful in better understanding of the relation between mqm and @xmath0 string theory and interesting by itself .",
    "singlet sector of mqm can be represented as non - relativistic fermions in the inverse harmonic potential .",
    "this fact can be viewed as a reason why the model is solvable . in terms of such fermions",
    "the most natural realization of the integrable structure of the theory can be formulated .",
    "moreover , recently these fermions acquired physical interpretation  @xcite . therefore they should be considered as fundamental objects of the theory rather than just a technical tool .",
    "so it is useful to consider generalizations of the theory which are the most natural from the point of view of the fermions and not only from the world - sheet string theory perspective .",
    "the simplest modification of this kind is to consider the fermions in the harmonic ( rather than inverse harmonic ) potential .",
    "this system has several interesting features .",
    "first of all , it has a discrete spectrum which , for example , makes much clearer the constructions of many - particle wave functions .",
    "this is important e.g. when one is interested in non - perturbative effects .",
    "another important feature is the finite depth fermi sea instead of infinite dirac sea , which is natural for _ non - relativistic _ fermions .",
    "these features do not necessary imply that the theory has no dual string theory description .",
    "one can imagine the theory in , say , potential sketched on the figure  [ fig : potential ] .",
    "such a theory looks like inverse harmonic oscillator near the maximum ( apart from the fact that all states are metastable ) and almost like harmonic oscillator near the minimum . the complete theory in such a potential can be considered from the point of view of the inverse harmonic potential as one of the possible ( non - universal ) regularizations .",
    "both limits are universal and are related by the analytic continuation ( see  @xcite for the discussion ) . in the first limit",
    "the ( double)scaled theory has infinite fermi sea and continuous spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to the continuous limit of mqm from the point of view of surface triangulation and gives @xmath0 string theory in the linear dilaton background .",
    "if one is instead interested in some other string theory , this feature is not necessary .",
    "moreover , it can in principle even prevent one from describing in terms of the fermions a theory which in fact does not imply infinite fermi sea for fermions ( d - branes ) whose condensate is a dual description of its background .      in this paper",
    "we take the following approach .",
    "we try to find a bosonic theory which is equivalent to the system of fermions in the harmonic potential in a sense that all operators and their expectation values are in one to one correspondence .",
    "this correspondence is directly _ derived _ and can be viewed as an example of an _ exact bosonization _ of non - relativistic fermions .",
    "string theory ) .",
    "this approach is somewhat similar to the one , undertaken in this paper .",
    "we leave detailed comparison for the future work . ]",
    "this derivation has two steps .",
    "first , one tries to bosonize fermions in terms of free scalar using the analogy with the theory of relativistic fermions . in the case of the inverse harmonic potential",
    "this gives an interacting and highly non - trivial effective field theory  @xcite which simplifies only asymptotically , far from a classical turning point , where fermions are almost relativistic .",
    "many - particle state of the fermions form a fermi sea in the phase space of the system .",
    "the oscillators of this bosonic effective theory correspond to the small deformations propagating along the fermi sea .",
    "these deformations are well - defined in the phase space and are two - dimensional in their nature .",
    "it means , in particular , that the wave function , corresponding to the perturbed fermi sea , are not eigen - functions of the hamiltonian with the harmonic ( inverse harmonic ) potential .",
    "if one tries to find a hamiltonian for which this wave - function will be an eigen - state , such hamiltonian turns out to be very complicated and non - local ( c.f .",
    "however , in both cases of harmonic and inverse harmonic potential there exist a very simple equivalent reformulation of the problem in terms of a system of free fermions in two dimensions in the strong uniform magnetic field  @xcite . in such field",
    "the system is confined to the zero energy level of its hamiltonian .",
    "this level is infinitely degenerate .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that all wave - functions which correspond to all possible incompressible deformations of the fermi sea belong to this level .",
    "the equivalence with the one - dimensional problem can be established as follows . to consider thermodynamic properties of the system , one needs to choose an @xmath1-particle ground state . according to the fermi statistics , it is usually build as a slater determinant of the first @xmath1 eigen functions of the hamiltonian .",
    "when working with the space of the solutions of the equation @xmath2 , to do this one needs to choose some ordering on this infinitely degenerate energy level .",
    "this is done by choosing any ( hermitian ) operator commuting with the hamiltonian and choosing ordered basis of its eigen - functions .",
    "if one chooses the angular momentum operator @xmath3 for the ordering , the system of equations @xmath4 is exactly equivalent to the one - dimensional equation @xmath5 and the @xmath1-particle ground state of this system coincides with undeformed fermi sea in the phase space of one - dimensional system .",
    "if one chooses some other operator for the ordering , the ground state and , therefore , the shape of the fermi sea will be different .",
    "but the wave - functions corresponding to all of them have one common property  they satisfy first of the equations  ( [ eq:220 ] ) .",
    "that is why two dimensional representation is convenient for the study of effective field theory description of the system .    as a result , instead of eigen - value problem of one - dimensional hamiltonian of mqm one",
    "has a wheeler - dewitt type equation saying that the two - dimensional hamiltonian is equal to zero .",
    "the same happens if one relates e.g. quantization of the relativistic particle in terms of coordinate time ( after fixing some space - time splitting ) to the covariant quantization of the same system with respect to its proper time done without any coordinate choice .",
    "this is why such a two dimensional reformulation can be considered to be a relativistic reformulation of the mqm system  @xcite . in this",
    "two - dimensional formulation different shapes of the fermi sea on the mqm side all become solutions of the same two - dimensional hamiltonian ( wheeler - dewitt ) equation , corresponding to the different choices of the space - time splitting .",
    "this reformulation allows to write down a bosonization of the system in terms of the free chiral two - dimensional boson . in case of inverse harmonic potential , this result is contained , somewhat implicitly , in  @xcite and for both potentials in  @xcite .",
    "the bosonization described above has nevertheless one unpleasant feature .",
    "the theory of free boson obviously has ultra - violet divergences .",
    "on the other hand , the initial theory of @xmath1 non - relativistic fermions is finite at any scale .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that the system of such fermions has the finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , not all degrees of freedom of bosonic field are independent for finite @xmath1 . to be able to reconstruct properly quantum - mechanical correlators for a finite , but large @xmath1 from the field theoretical description , one needs to be more careful with the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the solution of this problem , described in the present paper for the case of the harmonic potential , gives rise to the following picture . instead of chiral boson",
    ", we have the system of the full boson @xmath6 plus ( modified ) liouville field with the action @xmath7 = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi } \\int d^2 z \\left\\{\\partial x \\bar \\partial x      +   \\partial \\phi \\bar \\partial \\phi+ \\frac{2i}h\\phi -      \\mu e^{i \\phi }    \\right\\}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath8 is a constant of order @xmath9 ) .",
    "vertex operator in this system , corresponding to the local fermion operator on the quantum mechanical side , looks like @xmath10 let us stress , that this theory is an _",
    "exact _ bosonization of the system of fermions in the harmonic potential and it is derived explicitly in the present paper . in the limit when the fermi sea is a step - function , liouville field freezes to its background value and effectively imposes the dirichlet boundary condition on the boson @xmath6 . in this way",
    "we recover the initial bosonization in terms of free chiral boson .    surprisingly , this system looks very much like string theory .",
    "there are , however , two differences with the string theory in the linear dilaton background  @xcite .",
    "first , the exponent in the liouville field is imaginary .",
    "this is due to compactness of the fermi sea .",
    "this property can be removed by analytic continuation , which should be done simultaneously in the @xmath11-plane and in the space of the field @xmath12 .",
    "this continuation is tricky . for the chiral boson without liouville field analytic continuation in",
    "the @xmath11-plane relates the theories in harmonic and inverse harmonic potentials as well as bosonization formulas for these theories  @xcite .",
    "generalization of this analytic continuation for the full theories is discussed in the section  [ sec:2dstr ] .",
    "another important difference is the appearance of the background term in  ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "this background is not a usual curvature term as in the action of @xmath0 string theory and thus can not be removed from the action by a shift of field @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath0 string theory the field redefinition @xmath13 can be compensated by the weyl rescaling of the world - sheet metric @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the curvature term can be eliminated and the liouville term @xmath15 remains unchanged . in the case",
    "involved , we do not have an analog of the @xmath16 term in the action  ( [ eq:15 ] ) . as a result",
    ", the field redefinition @xmath17 would modify the liouville potential @xmath18 ( we will return to this question in sections  [ sec : liouville - eq ] , [ sec:2dstr ] ) .",
    "thus , this linear term is a real modification of the theory and it would be there also in the same analysis for the inverse harmonic potential .",
    "the result of this modification is important  it is responsible for the regular behavior of the correlators at small scales , as discussed in the sections  [ sec : liouville ] ,  [ sec : density - matrix ] .",
    "this feature , which is the main reason why liouville field is necessary in the bosonization of the non - relativistic fermions , is expected from the _ space - time _ picture of a string theory .",
    "indeed , our analysis is the analog of the das - jevicki collective field theory approach ( made for harmonic potential , in a different way and valid at any scale ) .",
    "this collective theory is believed to be indeed the space - time theory .",
    "therefore our theory should have the same interpretation as well .",
    "this space - time interpretation and why our theory is so similar to the world - sheet theory is not yet clear for us . ) which is almost ( but not completely ! ) the same as the one of  @xcite .",
    "one important difference between our theory and that of  @xcite is that in the latter background term is treated as a usual curved metric background in liouville theory .",
    "thus it can be removed by a field redefinition . in our case",
    "it is not true , as it was discussed above as well as in the end of section  [ sec : liouville - eq ] .",
    "the importance of this modification is that it makes correlators finite at small scales .",
    "this makes two theories physically different . due to the same reason",
    ", `` duality map '' seems to be different as well .",
    "for example , local fermion operators correspond to the vertex operators on the `` string theory '' side in our case .",
    "the two - point function of vertex operators is non - singular , in agreement with the quantum mechanical result . at the same time",
    "if one calculates two point function of the same vertex operators in the model suggested by  @xcite , it will have an ultra - violet singularity usual for a conformal field theory .",
    "it is therefore unclear how to build the operators representing fermions correctly in the model  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in  @xcite the space - time interpretation of the theory is not discussed .",
    "if the proposed there duality is correct , it gives a world - sheet rather than a space - time theory . ]",
    "we study one - dimensional fermions in the harmonic potential . as it was discussed in  @xcite and reviewed in section  [ sec : intro ] , this theory can be equivalently reformulated as the system of two - dimensional fermions in the magnetic field . in this section",
    "we will show that it is equivalent to the `` imaginary '' liouville field theory .",
    "this field theory is in its spirit a collective field theory  @xcite , written in terms of the density of fermions , rather than describing the dynamics of individual fermions .",
    "we begin with the following family of ground states of the system of fermions:[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath19     particles.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the discussion below will be concerned with the statistically large number of particles .",
    "the thermodynamic limit of this system is defined as @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that in this limit ground state  ( [ laughlin ] ) describes fermions forming round droplet of radius @xmath21 with the constant density equal @xmath22 inside and zero outside .",
    "namely , the average of density operator @xmath23 has the profile , shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : density ]  . notice that the width of the `` edge '' ( transition region between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) is proportional to 1 in our units ( and is small compared to the radius ) .",
    "in many cases it is enough to approximate this profile by the step - function : @xmath26 , however , one should take into account , that this is a _ non - uniform approximation _ : for @xmath27 difference between the real distribution and the step - function is always of order one",
    ".    wave - function  ( [ laughlin ] ) is _ not _ normalized .",
    "the norm of the ground state  ( [ laughlin ] ) is defined by @xmath28 @xmath29 can be interpreted as a partition sum of the coulomb plasma , by noticing that eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the classical energy of a 2d coulomb plasma of particles of charge @xmath32 moving in the uniform background of particle density @xmath33 .",
    "this coulomb plasma analogy allows for a simple and transparent way to understand what kind of collective field theory one should expect .",
    "first of all , it is easy to show that the density distribution has be approximated by the step - function ( see e.g.  @xcite in the context of quantum hall effect or  @xcite in the context of matrix models ) . for many problems",
    "step - function - like density is enough , but let us stress once again that it is a non - uniform approximation on the edge of the droplet .",
    "this approximation can be significantly improved by noticing that  ( [ pf ] ) looks like a plasma with the temperature @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , let us introduce the electric potential @xmath35 satisfying the 2d poisson equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total charge density created by both particles and background in the system .",
    "the key approximation , often used for such a system is to say , that the distribution of the mobile charge in the external electric field is given by the boltzmann law ( recall that the temperature is @xmath34 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the _",
    "fugacity_. combining equations ( [ boltzmann ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) we find that the scalar potential @xmath40 satisfies the equation @xmath41 for our purposes the parameter @xmath39 is to be chosen so that the total number of particles be equal to @xmath1 @xmath42 equations  ( [ liouville ] ) and  ( [ constraint ] ) constitute the closed set of equations which determine the density distribution of the fermionic droplet in our approximation .",
    "solution to this equation gives rise to a smooth function , which serves as a better approximation to the real density , computed over  ( [ laughlin ] ) .",
    "loop expansion of the field theory ( discussed in the section  [ sec : tk ] ) will give a uniform approximation .",
    "this smoothing out is responsible for getting rid of the ultra - violet singularities in the fermion correlators ( c.f .",
    "section  [ sec : density - matrix ] ) .",
    "( [ liouville ] ) is clearly of the liouville type ( modulo the constant term ) .",
    "thus , we can expect , that written in terms of field @xmath40 ( which is , essentially , the logarithm of the fermion density ) , one should get the collective field theory , related to that of liouville .",
    "to derive a field theoretical reformulation of the quantum mechanics of @xmath1 fermions  ( [ laughlin ] ) , we will show that in the large @xmath1 limit the grand partition function of the system  ( [ coulombh ] ) ( or , equivalently ,  ( [ laughlin ] ) ) can be calculated by means of field - theoretical path integral .",
    "the saddle point equation of this theory will reproduce  ( [ liouville ] ) .",
    "we define grand canonical ensemble of the coulomb plasma via for @xmath43 , formal sum  ( [ eq:22 ] ) is divergent .",
    "this , however , can be cured by an ir regularization .",
    "for details , see appendix  [ sec : careful ] and work  @xcite .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath53 has the dimension of inverse length squared . is a running coupling constant satisfying the rg equation @xmath54 .",
    "see appendix  [ sec : careful ] for details . ]",
    "we have shown that the grand canonical ensemble of @xmath1 fermions can be rewritten as the field theory  ( [ sli ] ) .",
    "several comments are of order here .",
    "first , we have derived the theory , similar to the usual liouville field theory , however with an imaginary ( rather than real ) exponential term  _ liouville theory with imaginary coupling_. for the sake of shortness we will often call it _ imaginary liouville theory _ and sometimes simply liouville theory , whenever it does not cause a confusion .    as already discussed in introduction",
    ", this action has an apparent distinction from the ordinary liouville theory .",
    "namely there is a background term @xmath55 .",
    "notice , that by the field redefinition @xmath56 this term can be traded for the linear term in the action of the form @xmath57 ( as in  ( [ eq:15 ] ) ) , which resembles a background curvature term in the usual liouville action : @xmath58 = \\frac 1{8\\pi}\\int d^2 z\\,\\sqrt g\\left({\\partial}\\phi \\bar{\\partial}\\phi + r(g )      \\phi + \\mu e^\\phi\\right)\\ ] ] yet , it is _ not _ a curvature ( unlike that in  ( [ eq:37 ] ) ) .",
    "indeed , in the action  ( [ eq:37 ] ) one can perform the shift of variable @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 .",
    "then the curvature term would disappear , while liouville terms would remain the same , as an additional factor @xmath61 would be absorbed into the weyl rescaling of the metric @xmath62 .",
    "on the other hand , in the imaginary liouville action  ( [ sli ] ) there is no analog of the weyl symmetry and thus the background term constitutes the physical modification of the action  ( [ sli ] ) .",
    "this term is responsible for making short - distance behavior of the correlators , computed in the theory  ( [ sli ] ) finite .",
    "we will discuss the importance of this term , as well as other ( dis)similarities with the usual @xmath0 string theory in section  [ sec:2dstr ] .",
    "notice also , that the problem , mentioned in the footnote  [ fn:1 ]  , translates in the language of the theory  ( [ sli ] ) into the well - known fact that one does not have an analytic expansion in parameter @xmath39 ( as could be erroneously concluded from the definition  ( [ eq:22 ] ) ) .",
    "at last , it can be shown ( if one takes care of all the subtleties , which arose in the derivation of section  [ sec : liouville - eq ] , c.f .",
    "appendix  [ sec : careful ] ) the correlators computed with respect to the grand canonical and canonical ensembles with the number of particles given by @xmath63 will be the same .      field theory  ( [ sli ] ) should be an equivalent description of the original system of fermions in the magnetic field with the ground state  ( [ laughlin ] ) .",
    "thus , we need to identify the vertex operators in this theory , whose correlators reproduce the quantum - mechanical averages of the fermions .    we begin with the fermion density operator , given in the first - quantized formalism by @xmath64 on the ground state this operator acts as @xmath65 to find a path integral representation of the density operator  ( [ eq:28 ] ) we need to pass to the grand canonical ensemble in the correlator @xmath66 : @xmath67 substituting the exponential from  ( [ eq:25 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ hft ] ) and performing the sum we obtain the @xmath68-point density matrix in terms of the average in imaginary liouville theory : @xmath69 where the average is taken in the theory with the action ( [ sli ] ) . comparing the right hand side and the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ denmatlio ] ) we identify the density operator in the liouville theory : @xmath70 where @xmath39 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) .",
    "thus we can reproduce in the field theoretical formulation density - density correlation functions of the quantum mechanics of fermions .",
    "in particular , saddle point equation of  ( [ sli ] ) ( which coincides with  ( [ liouville ] ) as expected ) reproduces qualitatively the correct behavior of the density .",
    "indeed , it can be shown ( see  @xcite ) that it looks as a step function smoothed out at the edge ( see qualitative picture on the fig .",
    "[ fig : density ]  ) .",
    "other properties of the density correlators will be discussed later . here",
    "we would like to stress that to have the full correspondence between the quantum mechanics and liouville theory we are still lacking at least one important ingredient .",
    "namely , an important object in quantum mechanics of the system of many fermions is a _ local fermion operator_. for example , instead of the density @xmath71 we could calculate fermionic two point function @xmath72 . as @xmath73 . ]",
    "important feature of the fermion operator is that it is _ chiral_. in the first quantized formalism the operator @xmath74 multiplies the wave function by @xmath75 : in the rest of this section to make presentation more transparent .",
    "full derivation will be presented in the section  [ sec : free - boson ] . ]",
    "@xmath76 the only ingredient at our disposal so far  the liouville field @xmath77  is not chiral : insertion of density operator @xmath78 corresponds to the multiplication of the ground state by the non - chiral object @xmath79 .",
    "thus , it turns out that to bosonize the fermion operators one needs to have an additional chiral field @xmath80 as it was discussed e.g. in @xcite . in the following sections  [ sec : idls]  [ sec : free - boson ] we will remind this bosonization procedure starting from the quantum mechanics of the fermions and",
    "will show how to blend it with the construction of the section  [ sec : liouville - eq ] . in short , the answer will be the following .",
    "we will introduce an additional free scalar field @xmath81 in the liouville field theory : @xmath82 = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi } \\int d^2 z \\left\\{\\partial x \\bar \\partial x      +   \\partial \\phi \\bar \\partial \\phi-      \\mu e^{i \\phi -| z |^2 }    \\right\\}\\ ] ] in terms of the fields @xmath77 and @xmath81 the local fermion operator in the theory  ( [ eq:48 ] ) will be defined as @xmath83 where @xmath80 and @xmath84 are chiral and anti - chiral components of the field @xmath81",
    ".    expression  ( [ eq:49 ] ) can be understood as follows . as we have seen in  ( [ eq:46 ] ) @xmath85 multiplies the wave function by the factors @xmath86 .",

    "( [ eq:47 ] ) ( together with its anti - holomorphic counter - part ) , we can see that the vertex operator  ( [ eq:49 ] ) turns the wave function @xmath87 into @xmath88 that is @xmath89 is indeed local fermion operator !    to summarize , we see that the theory  ( [ eq:48 ] ) is equivalent to the quantum mechanics of @xmath1 non - relativistic fermions in the uniform magnetic field ( including the correct structure of the vertex operators ) .",
    "the relation between two theories is very similar to the usual bosonization .",
    "indeed , we know that for relativistic two - dimensional fermions there is an exact bosonization . it was shown in  @xcite that the infinite number of the non - relativistic fermions in the harmonic ( and inverse harmonic ) potentials can be described in terms of free chiral two - dimensional boson",
    ". nevertheless , for any large but finite number of particles @xmath1 such bosonization is valid in the infra - red regime only .",
    "the reason for that is quite simple .",
    "the theory of 2d boson is a relativistic field theory and it has ultra - violet singularities at small scales .",
    "these singularities are of course absent in the quantum mechanical system of the finite number of non - relativistic fermions .",
    "thus , to have the exact bosonization valid at all scales , we need more complicated theory which is finite in the ultra - violet . in case at hand this appears to be the theory  ( [ eq:48])([eq:49 ] ) .",
    "notice , that in spite of the similarities between the actions  ( [ eq:48 ] ) and that of @xmath0 string theory , they are quite different in nature . the main difference is the background term @xmath90 in the action  ( [ eq:48 ] ) , which ( as discussed in section  [ sec : dens - op - liouv ] after eq .  ( [ eq:51 ] ) ) and is responsible for uv regularization of the theory .",
    "as discussed previously , this term can not be removed by the field redefinition and thus represents the modification of the theory and not just a curved background of liouville theory .",
