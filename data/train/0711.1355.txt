    "stellar populations synthesis models have been widely used to make inferences about the evolutionary status of observed systems by means of a comparison between observations and model results . in general",
    "it is assumed that the observed system is _ well mixed _ in terms of stellar populations and that models provide an one - to - one relation between the integrated luminosity and the physical conditions under the model is performed . in other words , it is assumed that the distribution of the possible integrated luminosities of a cluster with given physical conditions ( including its number of stars ) is a dirac s delta - like distribution .",
    "however , this assumption is not compatible with the very method implicit in synthesis codes , when they make use of probability distributions , like the initial mass function , to describe the contribution of different stellar types to the integrated light . in the most optimistic case , and following the central limit theorem",
    ", the distribution of integrated luminosities must follow a gaussian like probability distribution in the asymptotic case of complete well mixed stellar types in the cluster ( i.e. theoretical clusters with infinite number of stars ) .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    in this contribution",
    "we discuss the distributed nature of theoretical integrated luminosities of stellar clusters .",
    "we take advantage of such distributions to propose a metric that allows to establish the accuracy of fits of observations with models .",
    "we will assume that models are not affected by systematic errors ( but see @xcite for detailed discussions on this subject ) , and we will consider here only the intrinsic dispersion of the theoretical integrated luminosities .",
    "the first step needed to use population synthesis models is to understand how synthesis codes work .",
    "the main goal of synthesis codes is to obtain the integrated luminosity resulting from an ensemble of individual stars with given physical conditions ( initial mass function imf , metallicity @xmath0 , star formation history sfh , age @xmath1 ... ) .",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 individual stars have been observed in a resolution element of a telescope ( e.g. a pixel , a slit , an ifu , a set of several pixels , etc . ) .",
    "since each star has an actual luminosity @xmath3 , the total luminosity @xmath4 in the resolution element is :    @xmath5    where we have rewritten @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath6 is the _ estimation of the mean _ luminosity of an individual star that represents the whole ensemble for the actual physical conditions .",
    "however , we can not perform such a sum and obtain the actual integrated luminosity of _ this _ set of individual stars since these stars are not resolved and we do not know the individual @xmath3 values . instead",
    ", we can compute the _ actual mean luminosity _ of all the ensembles with the same physical conditions : it should be the composition of @xmath7 different stellar populations ( or different stellar types ) for the given physical conditions .",
    "if we assume that a given stellar type `` @xmath8 '' can be represented by a luminosity @xmath9 and we know _ the probability _ @xmath10 to have a star with a given stellar type determinated by the given physical conditions ( @xmath11 $ ] ) , then a total luminosity of the system will be    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the luminosity of an _ average _ star that represents the ensemble for the given physical conditions .",
    "synthesis codes provide @xmath13 with a suitable normalization , like the one in eq .",
    "[ eq : lsspnorm ] .    obviously , _ the average _ integrated luminosity of stellar clusters with @xmath2 stars is @xmath2 times the luminosity of this average star , but _ the possible _ integrated luminosity of a cluster is a distributed quantity .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ eq : lssp ] does not provide the whole description of the possible integrated luminosity of an observation of @xmath2 unresolved stars , but only the mean value of the underlying probability distribution that describes the possible integrated luminosities of all observations that contain @xmath2 unresolved stars . in the following we will use @xmath15 instead of @xmath14 to avoid confusion about this point .    since we know that the theoretical integrated luminosity is a distributed quantity",
    ", we can go further and also obtain other quantities , besides the mean , which describe this distribution .",
    "in particular , the variance ( which depends on how many unresolved stars are in the resolution element ) and the variance normalized to the mean integrated luminosity ( which is independent on the number of stars ) , we refer @xcite for more details in this subject is related to surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) when they are considered as a description of the variance of synthesis models ; see @xcite for more details . ] .",
    "@xmath16 & = & n \\sigma^2(\\ell ) = n \\ , \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{class } } } w_{j}\\ , l_{j}^2 - < \\ell>^2\\right);\\label{eq : sspvar}\\\\    & & \\frac{\\sigma^2[l_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{theo}}(n)]}{<l_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{\\mathrm{theo}}(n ) > } = \\frac{\\sigma^2(\\ell)}{<\\ell>}.\\label{eq : sspsbf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    summing up , _ synthesis codes provide the luminosity of an average star or cluster _ ( depending on the normalization used in eq . [",
    "eq : lsspnorm ] ) _ that describes the mean luminosity of the ensemble for given physical conditions_. codes can also provide the dispersion of the integrated luminosities around the mean by the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : sspvar ] or eq .",
    "[ eq : sspsbf ] .    in the following sections we show two different uses of the dispersion as metrics for goodness - of - fit in stellar population studies .",
    "we will assume that the theoretical probability distributions of integrated luminosities follow a gaussian distribution ( see @xcite for reliable criteria of gaussianity of synthesis model results ) .",
    "let us move now to the application of synthesis models to study stellar populations in galaxies and stellar clusters .",
    "the problem is to infer the evolutionary conditions that are compatible with the observed integrated luminosity @xmath4 and to establish the confidence of the different hypothesis .",
    "following dagostini work _ from observations to hypotheses _ @xcite : `` it becomes crucial to learn how to deal quantitatively with probability of causes because the _ `` problem(s ) in the probability of causes ... may be said to be the essential problem(s ) of the experimental method '' _ ( poincar @xcite ) . '' .",
    "let us illustrate the problem in fig .",
    "[ fig : prevsacu ] .",
    "we want to evaluate which model @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 is more compatible with an observation ( black cross ) . in the left panel",
    "we show the situation where only the mean value of the model is taken into account . in this case",
    ", @xmath17 is the closest model to the observation and it is the `` best '' solution . in the right panel",
    "we show the situation when the complete theoretical distribution is taken into account .",
    "the different concentric circles represent 1 , 2 and 3 @xmath20 confidence intervals associated to _",
    "each one _ of the models .",
    "@xmath17 is still the closest model but the probability that the observation is compatible with @xmath17 is lower than 1% ( i.e. the observation lies outside of the 99% confidence interval of @xmath17 ) . the observation is compatible with @xmath18 in a 2@xmath20 confidence interval of @xmath18 and compatible with @xmath19 in a 3@xmath20 confidence interval of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the `` closest '' model ( following each model s metrics ) is @xmath18 .",
    "this second solution is different than the previous ( precise but not accurate ) one .        summing up , since our main interest is to have accurate ( and not only precise ) results , it is necessary to know the complete probability distributions of theoretical integrated luminosities and not only its mean values @xmath15 .",
    "the probability distribution of theoretical integrated luminosities provides a _",
    "metric for goodness - of - fit _ to stellar population studies .",
    "analysis method must obtain the closest model to the observation according with the metric defined by each model itself , and not by an `` absolute '' metric that does not take into account the intrinsic model dispersion .",
    "we illustrate in the following sections two different ways of using the metric associated to theoretical models .",
    "let us first work with the variance of the distribution ( @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sspvar ] ) .",
    "the dispersion ( @xmath20 ) of the integrated luminosity is proportional to the square - root of the number of stars in the observed population , so we need to have an estimation of how many stars are in our resolution element , or , equivalently , the distance to the source .    figs . [",
    "fig : ssprelative ] and [ fig : ssprelative_detail ] show the mean energy distribution and relative dispersion of a model of a solar metallicity 1 ga old cluster with @xmath22 stars .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the relative dispersion increases almost by a factor two ( at this age and metallicity ) at red wavelengths .",
    "this happens because the stars that contribute the most _ to the mean _ integrated luminosity at red wavelengths are also the most sparse ones and a small variation in the total number of such stars is translated to a large variation in the integrated luminosity .",
    "this situation can be reformulated by saying that infrared wavelengths have a lower _ effective number _ of stars than the visible ( see @xcite for a more detailed description and implications about the effective number of stars that contibute to a given wavelength ) .",
    "second : line profiles have different dispersion degree ( cfr .",
    "[ fig : ssprelative_detail ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath23 line has an _ intrinsic _ higher dispersion than h@xmath24 .",
    "this means that the profile of h@xmath23 is more sensitive than the profile of h@xmath24 to particular stellar populations in the cluster , so it can provide information about those particular stellar populations , but not about the _ overall _ population .",
    "as an alternative to the relative dispersion , we can use the mean - averaged dispersion defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : sspsbf ] .",
    "the advantage of the mean - averaged dispersion is that it is independent of the number of stars in the cluster ( hence , also independent of the distance )",
    "[ fig : sspsbf ] and [ fig : sspsbf_detail ] show the mean energy distribution and mean - averaged dispersion of a model of a solar metallicity 1 ga old . in this case , the mean spectra ( top panels ) is the one of an average individual star , as mentioned in section [ sec : sspdesc ] .    as previously , the mean - averaged dispersion increases at red wavelengths .",
    "absorption lines show a different behavior when expressed in this new units , but again , it shows similar conclusions : not all absorption lines can be fitted with the same precision .",
    "four conclusions can be drawn from this work : ( a ) the comparison of models and observations must be done taking into account the intrinsic metric of each model and not an absolute metric , ( b ) not all wavelengths must have the same weight in the fitting , ( c ) fits of line profiles have , in general , a larger dispersion than fits of the continuum , and ( d ) the more sensitive is the index ( line profile , equivalent width , color ... ) about _ a particular _ stellar population , the less useful is the index to describe the _ overall _ evolutionary status of the population .",
