    "first let us recall some terminologies in graph theory . for more one can refer to @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we suppose that all graphs are finite , simple and undirected . for a graph @xmath0 , denote an edge connecting the vertices @xmath1 by @xmath2 ; each edge @xmath2 gives rise to a pair of opposite arcs @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "use @xmath5 to denote the set of vertices , edges , arcs of @xmath0 , respectively , and use @xmath6 for the automorphism group .",
    "a graph is the same thing as a one - dimensional simplicial complex ( see @xcite , page 104 ) with orientation forgotten .",
    "a covering of graphs @xmath7 is a simplicial covering map of one - dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "it is called regular ( or an @xmath8-covering ) if there is a subgroup @xmath8 of the covering transformation group @xmath9 that acts regularly on each fiber .",
    "moreover @xmath10 if @xmath0 is connected .    an automorphism @xmath11 is lifted to @xmath12 if @xmath13 .",
    "the image of an arc @xmath14 ( or a walk @xmath15 ) is denoted @xmath16 ( respectively @xmath17 ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a finite group .",
    "an @xmath8-voltage assignment of @xmath0 is a function @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , for all @xmath20 ; the values of @xmath21 are called voltages .",
    "the graph @xmath22 derived from @xmath21 is defined by @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the first coordinate projection @xmath25 makes an @xmath8-coverings .",
    "given a spanning tree @xmath26 of @xmath0 , each edge @xmath27 is called cotree .",
    "a voltage assignment @xmath21 is called @xmath26-reduced if the voltage associated to each tree arc is the identity .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that every regular covering of @xmath0 is isomorphic to a derived graph from a @xmath26-reduced voltage assignment with respect to an arbitrary tree @xmath26 .",
    "the voltage assignment @xmath21 naturally extends to walks in @xmath0 . for any walk @xmath15 ,",
    "let @xmath28 denote the voltage of @xmath15 .",
    "we are able to give a nice solution to the following problem :    given a graph @xmath0 , a regular covering @xmath29 with @xmath8 a finite abelian group , and an automorphisms @xmath30 of @xmath0 , decide whether @xmath30 can be lifted .    the following proposition of @xcite plays a key role :    let @xmath22 be a regular covering .",
    "then an automorphism @xmath30 of @xmath0 can be lifted to an automorphism of @xmath31 if and only if , for each closed walk @xmath15 in @xmath0 , one has @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "recently much attention has been paid to the automorphism lifting problem .",
    "the motivation was to construct highly transitive graphs , and now is from different sources , for instance , to classify symmetries of graphs . in @xcite a linear criteria is proposed for the case that @xmath8 is elementary abelian , and applied to classify arc - transitive @xmath8-coverings of the petersen graph .",
    "in @xcite the authors classify all vertex - transitive elementary abelian coverings of the petersen graph ; the method , developed by themselves in @xcite , is finding invariant subspaces of a group representation .",
    "other results are @xcite , @xcite , and so on .    to the automorphism lifting problem for arbitrary finite abelian groups ,",
    "we contribute a criterion based on a theory for diagonalizing matrices over the ring @xmath34 .",
    "the criterion is easy to run , in that , one only needs to calculate some matrices derived from input data , and check whether the entries of the resulted matrices satisfy certain conditions .",
    "we believe that classifying finite abelian symmetries of graphs , at least for small graphs , is possible in the near future .",
    "we discuss a property of matrices over @xmath34 in section 2 , and apply it to give a criterion for lifting automorphisms in section 3 ; in section 4 a practical algorithm is presented and illustrated via an example .    here",
    "are some notational conventions .",
    "operations in abelian groups are written additively . for a matrix @xmath35 ,",
    "denote its @xmath36-entry by @xmath37 , and we often write @xmath38 . for a ring @xmath39 ,",
    "let @xmath40 be the set of all @xmath41-matrices with entries in @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath42 , and let @xmath43 be the set of invertible ones .",
    "let @xmath44 be a prime number , and @xmath45 .",
    "the ring @xmath46 is no longer an integral domain .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see that finitely generated modules over @xmath46 share some structures with those over a euclidean domain .",
    "we can talk about the divisibility of an element @xmath47 by @xmath48 , without ambiguity .",
    "note that @xmath49 is invertible if and only if it is not divisible by @xmath44 ; it follows that if @xmath49 is invertible and @xmath50 is not , then @xmath51 is invertible .    also , for @xmath52 , it is meaningful to talk about @xmath53 .    for @xmath54 ,",
    "the _ @xmath44-degree _ of @xmath49 , denoted @xmath55 , is the largest integer @xmath56 such that @xmath57 . for convention",

    "the result is analogous to that of matrices with entries in @xmath67 ( see @xcite , page ) , and is proved by showing that @xmath68 can be changed into normal form by a series of row and column transformations .",
    "choose an entry @xmath69 with smallest @xmath44-degree , and let @xmath70 .",
    "interchange the @xmath71-th row of @xmath68 with the first row , and the @xmath72-th column with the first column , and divide the first row by @xmath73 .",
    "the matrix obtained has @xmath74-entry @xmath75 , dividing all entries",
    ". then perform row - transformations to eliminate the @xmath76-entries for @xmath77 .",
    "denote the new matrix by @xmath78 .",
    "doing the same thing to the submatrix @xmath79 , of @xmath80 changes @xmath80 into @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , @xmath83 dividing @xmath84 ; @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "continue this process .",
    "eventually there is some @xmath88 , such that @xmath89 satisfies @xmath90 ; @xmath91 ; @xmath92 for @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "finally , perform column transformations to @xmath95 , to eliminate all the  off - diagonal \" entries .",
    "then the resulted matrix is in normal form .",
    "the following corollary , which is an analogue of the structure theorem of finitely modules over a euclidean domain ( see @xcite page 475 ) , is easy to prove .",
    "we state it without proof since it is never applied in this article .",
    "every finitely generated @xmath34-module has a set of generators @xmath96 such that there is no relation other than @xmath97 , with @xmath98 for some integers @xmath99 .    in the end of this section ,",
