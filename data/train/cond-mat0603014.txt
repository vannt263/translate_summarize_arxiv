    "the nature of the spin - fluctuation mediated interaction between charge carriers continues to attract high interest in the high - t@xmath5 superconductivity research  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations for the doped hubbard and @xmath6 models suggest that the strongest interaction between fermions is due to antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuations .",
    "the low - energy description of this interaction has been advanced in the framework of the spin - fermion model  @xcite .",
    "a magnetically mediated interaction has been intensively studied since the early days of high-@xmath7 era because af spin fluctuations induce @xmath8wave pairing between fermions  @xcite .",
    "various numerical and analytical calculations based on hubbard and @xmath6 models , as well as semi - phenomenological spin - fermion models , have been performed in the normal and superconducting states of the cuprates .",
    "the results of these calculations are in quite good agreement with a large number of experimental data .",
    "in particular , these calculations show that the magnetic response in a @xmath8wave superconducting state contains a resonance peak , in addition to a gapped continuum .",
    "the location of the peak , and its `` negative '' dispersion are in agreement with experimental data .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the scattering from the resonance is strong enough to explain the peak - dip - hump feature in the fermionic spectral function , the @xmath9shape dispersion for antinodal fermions , and similar features in sis tunneling , optical conductivity , and raman response .",
    "the strength of the feedback effects from the resonance peak on fermions , and the magnitude of the spin - mediated @xmath7 depend on the size of the spin - fermion coupling .",
    "the estimates for the coupling strength still vary substantially .",
    "abanov et al argued  @xcite that the coupling @xmath10 is comparable to the hubbard @xmath11 and is quite strong , @xmath12 . on the other hand , kee _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that the effective spin - fermion coupling is much weaker @xmath13 . in the latter work",
    "@xcite , the coupling was extracted from the specific heat data . to a large extent ,",
    "the difference between the two results is related to different choices for the fermionic density of states @xmath14 : a large value of @xmath10 is obtained by assuming a large luttinger fermi surface , with @xmath15 ( ref .  ) , while a smaller @xmath10 is obtained by assuming that the density of states @xmath16 is the same as in a weakly doped quantum af .",
    "this difference brings in the issue of how much the full spin - fermion vertex @xmath17 differs from the bare @xmath18 due to vertex corrections . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are incoming and outgoing fermionic momenta , and @xmath21 is the bosonic momentum .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 determines the vertex renormalization originating from electronic correlations .",
    "some of us have recently shown numerically that this quantity is substantially renormalized by strong electronic correlations both for the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) vertex  @xcite as well as for the el - sp vertex  @xcite .    within the spin - fermion model ,",
    "the role of the vertex renormalization is well understood in the limits of very small and relatively large doping . at very small doping @xmath23 , when long - range af order is still present , nearly all carriers are localized , and doped fermions form small pockets around @xmath24 and symmetry related points .",
    "in this situation , the full spin - fermion vertex @xmath17 vanishes when @xmath21 coincides with the antiferromagnetic momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath26 is the consequence of the adler principle that the interaction should preserve massless goldstone bosons in the theory and , therefore , should vanish at the ordering momentum of goldstone bosons . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the vertex is non - zero , but small in @xmath28 .",
    "mathematically , the vanishing of @xmath26 is the result of dressing up of the bare interaction @xmath29 by coherence factors , associated with the antiferromagnetic order . from this perspective , the strong reduction of @xmath17 when @xmath21 is close to @xmath30 is the result of a strong vertex renormalization .",
    "schrieffer argued  @xcite that , if the pocket - like fermi surface survives even when long - range af order is lost , the strong vertex renormalization extends into the paramagnetic phase . according to ref .",
    "@xmath31 \\sim \\frac{1}{[\\chi({{\\bf q}},\\omega=0 ) ] } , \\label{gamma_sc}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the af correlation length .",
    "( [ gamma_sc ] ) is valid , the effective spin - mediated interaction @xmath33 is considerably weaker than without vertex renormalization , and , most importantly , it is no longer peaked at @xmath34 .",
    "this is an important fact , since the peak structure at @xmath34 was responsible for a strong attractive @xmath8wave component in the pairing potential .",
    "the magnetically - mediated @xmath8wave pairing is still possible even in this situation , but the corresponding @xmath7 is much smaller than one would get without vertex corrections  @xcite .    in the opposite limit of large doping ,",
    "fermions are itinerant , and have a large fermi surface which crosses the magnetic brillouin zone boundary at hot spots ( this requires a sufficiently strong next - nearest - neighbor hopping ) .",
    "a spin - fluctuation with momentum near @xmath30 then can decay into a particle and a hole .",
    "analytical calculations within the spin - fermion model show that in this situation , the vertex is only weakly renormalized , and actually increases with respect to its bare value , i.  e. @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath36 depends on the angle @xmath37 between fermi velocities at hot spots separated by @xmath30  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is of order 1 .",
    "equation  ( [ a_1 ] ) shows that the renormalization is largest when @xmath40 .",
    "this limit corresponds to an almost nested fermi surface at hot spots . in",
    "optimally doped cuprates , the velocities at the hot spots separated by @xmath30 are almost perpendicular to each other , i.  e. , @xmath41 . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the vertex correction is then about 10% ( even smaller , @xmath43% , when one adds regular terms  @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the itinerant and localized limits raises the question how vertex corrections evolve as the system approaches half - filling .",
    "one attempt to address this issue was undertaken in ref .  .",
    "the authors of ref .   considered a toy spin - fermion model in which one can study the evolution from the luttinger fermi surface towards hole pockets .",
    "this evolution involves a topological transition below which a pocket is splitted from a large fermi surface , and the luttinger theorem breaks down . within this model ,",
    "vertex corrections evolve together with the fermi surface : they are small and positive ( i.  e. @xmath44 ) in the limit when the fermi surface is large , but change their sign near the topological transition , become negative and rapidly increase in magnitude as the fermi surface evolves towards hole pockets . for a pocket - like fermi surface , vertex corrections almost cancel the bare vertex , and the full @xmath17 coincides with schrieffer s result , eq .",
    "( [ gamma_sc ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of the strength of vertex corrections in the two - dimensional @xmath45 hubbard model by means of a quite accurate numerical method  the determinantal monte - carlo  @xcite algorithm .",
    "the purpose of our calculation is to explore the extent of validity in doping and temperature of schrieffer s argument  @xcite as well as of the spin - fermion model calculation  @xcite : whereas the analytical results are only valid when the correlation length @xmath32 is large , monte - carlo calculations are not restricted by this condition .",
    "we also want to get an insight as up to what extent a description in terms of low - energy spin degrees of freedom , i.  e. in terms of a spin - fermion model is appropriate for the hubbard model .",
    "vertex corrections have been analyzed by some of us in ref .  .",
    "the present paper extends this earlier letter in three different directions .",
    "first , in order to separate vertex and quasiparticle renormalization effects , we analyze the vertex renormalization and the pairing interaction with and without the inclusion of the wave - function renormalization @xmath46 .",
    "the vertex without the renormalization of @xmath46 is labeled by @xmath47 before and in eq .",
    "( [ five ] ) below .",
    "this vertex is for the interaction between spin fluctuations and strongly interacting particles .",
    "this vertex has to be used for comparison with analytical results which do nt include the rescaling by the fermionic @xmath46 .",
    "the fully renormalized vertex is the one rescaled by @xmath46 ( we label it by @xmath48 , see eq .",
    "( [ nine ] ) below )  @xcite .",
    "it describes the interaction between spin fluctuations and quasiparticles .",
    "we discuss the difference between the two vertices in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and also discuss there the behavior of the pairing interaction between interacting particles and quasiparticles .",
    "second , we calculate the momentum dependence of the vertex .",
    "third , we discuss in detail the effect of bosonic damping on the strength of the vertex renormalization .",
    "we show that the introduction of a next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 , which makes the bosonic damping possible , substantially reduces the renormalization of @xmath49 ( but not of @xmath50 ) .",
    "our numerical monte carlo simulations are performed on a @xmath51 lattice at different doping densities and different temperatures . in our finite lattice ,",
    "the @xmath52 point is the one closest to the hot spots , so that charge carriers near the @xmath52 region are strongly affected by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we will mainly concentrate on the particular scattering process in which the incoming electron and spin fluctuation carry momenta @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . within our @xmath55-points",
    "mesh , the points @xmath55 and @xmath56 lie sufficiently close to the fermi surface .    our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] , we define the hamiltonian and describe the numerical approach , which is based on the quantum - monte - carlo evaluation of the linear response to an external spin perturbation . in section  [ results ] , we present our numerical results and discuss their qualitative relation with the spin - fermion - model calculation and eq .",
    "[ gamma_sc ] . finally , in section  [ conclusions ] , we discuss in detail our main conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the one - band hubbard model , @xmath57 here , the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 as usual create and destroy an electron with spin @xmath60 at site @xmath61 , respectively , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote a sum over nearest and next - nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath61 and @xmath64 , respectively .",

    "finally , @xmath11 is the onsite coulomb interaction and the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 is chosen as the unit of energy . in order to consider the effects of damping , we include a next - nearest - neighbor hopping term @xmath1 .    in our simulation",

    "the total pairing interaction @xmath89 for the exchange of a single spin fluctuation can be expressed in terms of the vertex @xmath49 as @xmath90 where @xmath77 is the spin susceptibility @xmath91 eq .

    "in order to explore the momentum structure of the el - sp interaction , we first plot @xmath77 , @xmath95 , and @xmath93 versus @xmath21 at different temperatures in fig .",

    "one can readily see that both @xmath77 and @xmath93 are peaked at momentum transfers around the antiferromagnetic vector @xmath98 , and the strength of the peaks increases when the temperature is lowered .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath21- and @xmath99-dependences of the spin susceptibility @xmath100 dominate the temperature behavior of the pairing interaction , despite the reduction of the vertex @xmath49 as the temperature is decreased . from fig .",
    "[ vp_gamma_chi ] , we observe that the decrease with temperature of @xmath49 at large momentum transfers is stronger than at small momentum transfers , indicating that the vertex correction at @xmath34 is larger than at small @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath21-dependence of the el - sp vertex is qualitatively in agreement with the prediction of eq.([gamma_sc ] ) .",

    "@xcite ( carried out at @xmath97 ) , which shows a value of @xmath101 ( corresponding @xmath102 in our notation ) can produce an effective coupling @xmath103 which is consistent with the results of monte carlo calculation of the irreducible particle - hole vertex , and that the effective particle - particle interaction originating from the hubbard @xmath11 increases with lowering temperature and can reach large values .",

    "we notice that in the underdoped regime ( @xmath108 ) for both intermediate ( @xmath97 ) and strong correlation ( @xmath109 ) , both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are strongly renormalized below a characteristic temperature ( @xmath112 for @xmath109 ) .",
    "although our simulation can not reach low temperatures , a clear trend is observable in both @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which tend to go to small values at low temperatures , at least for @xmath109 .",
    "a more careful look shows that the reduction of the vertices @xmath49 and @xmath50 is chiefly due to the reduction of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the imaginary parts of the vertices are small at weak and intermediate correlations ( at our lowest accessible @xmath99 ) , but for @xmath109 they can become comparable to the real parts .",
    "further , our numerical results presented in fig .  [ vpv_z_t ] clearly show that , in both intermediate- and strong - correlation regimes , the renormalized pairing interaction @xmath115 ( which does not include the dressing by the quasiparticle @xmath46 ) is smaller than the rpa result obtained with the full susceptibility @xmath116 .",
    "the difference becomes strongest at the lowest accessible temperatures .",
    "the qualitative temperature behavior of the effective pairing interaction between quasiparticles @xmath117 , is quite similar to @xmath89 in the intermediate - correlation ( @xmath97 ) regime .",

    "based on the results shown in fig .",
    "[ vpv_z_t ] , we conclude that for @xmath118 , both vertex corrections and the renormalization of @xmath46 are important for the spin - mediated pairing interaction .",
    "vertex corrections suppress @xmath119 compared to the case of free fermions .",
    "the rescaling by @xmath46 further suppresses the effective pairing interaction between quasiparticles , @xmath94 .",
    "note , though , that the pairing interaction @xmath119 at a bosonic @xmath120 and fermionic @xmath121 near the antinodal point still increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "[ vpv_z_t ] shows that vertex corrections are substantial even in the case when the af correlation length @xmath32 is quite small  @xcite",
    ". i.  e. of order of the cu - cu distance .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation discussed by schrieffer in which holes move in an af background , which is unaffected by the charge carriers , i.  e. @xmath32 is large .",
    "how can we understand this result ?",
    "in the af precursor ( large-@xmath32 ) case  @xcite , the vanishing of the el - sp interaction in the long - range ordered af state is the result of dressing up of the bare interaction by the af coherence factor , which is small at the top of the valence band .",
    "the coherence factor is due to the interference effect of the quasiparticle , which forms a `` spin - bag '' , i.  e. a hole dressed by a short - range af background .",
    "although in our calculation the af precursor is no longer present , it is well established from our earlier qmc work on the evolution of the single - particle spectral function @xmath122  @xcite from an insulator to a metal that below @xmath123 , the electronic excitations display an essentially doping - independent feature .",
    "more precisely , a `` band '' of width @xmath124 forms , in which `` spin - bag''-like quasiparticles propagate coherently .",
    "the continuous evolution can be traced back to one and the same many - body origin : the doping - dependent af spin - spin correlation .",
    "therefore , we argue that the interference effect of the spin - bag quasiparticle plays a similar role in reducing the el - sp vertex in the strongly - correlated underdoped regime .    above we considered the pairing vertices for interacting particles and for quasiparticles .",
    "the actual strength of the pairing interaction is proportional to the product of the effective interaction @xmath117 and the density of states at the fermi level @xmath125 .",
    "since we restricted with only the pole component of @xmath126 , the conservation of the particle number implies that @xmath125 is increased by a factor @xmath46 with respect to the noninteracting density of states @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "this is similar to the case of the electron - phonon mediated pairing , where the interaction is also rescaled by one power of @xmath46 ( this last rescaling is a well - known mcmillan result @xmath129 . our consideration , in which we defined @xmath46 as the overall wave - function renormalization is formally different from electron - phonon problem , where the fermionic self - energy depends only on frequency .",
    "however , the final result is the same as in the case where self - energy only depends on frequency , the density of states is not renormalized by @xmath46 , but one power of @xmath46 , compared to @xmath130 is eliminated by the mass renormalization @xmath131 .    in order to have a measure of the pairing strength including the renormalization of the density of states , we thus plot the quantity @xmath132 in fig .",
    "[ pair_vz_t ] as a function of temperature for @xmath108 .",
    "we observe that @xmath132 increases with decreasing temperature in both intermediate- and strong - correlation regimes .",
    "on the other hand , the suppression of @xmath115 due to vertex corrections and the increase of @xmath46 with decreasing temperature considerably reduce the pairing ( i.  e. , without vertex corrections ) , in particular in the low - temperature regime .    as discussed in the introduction",

    "spin fluctuations get strongly damped due to the decay into particle and holes near the fermi surface . due to the finite temperature and short correlation length , a damping of spin fluctuations is also present for @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity @xmath138 shown in fig .",

    "<S> we study the renormalization of the electron - spin - fluctuation ( el - sp ) vertex in a two - dimensional hubbard model with nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) hopping by a quantum - monte - carlo calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish between el - sp vertices involving interacting particles and quasiparticles , i.e. separate the renormalizations of the vertex from that of the quasiparticle residue @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> the inclusion of a finite @xmath4 , increases the landau damping rate of spin fluctuations , especially in the overdoped region . </S>",
    "<S> the increased damping rate leads to smaller vertex corrections , in agreement with earlier diagrammatic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> still , corrections reduce the spin - fermion vertex even at finite @xmath1 . </S>"
