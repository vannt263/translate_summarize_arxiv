    "precision higher order statistics will become a reality when the new wide field surveys , such as the sdss and the 2df , become available in the near future .",
    "these prospective measurements contain information relating to the regime of structure formation , to the nature of initial conditions , and to the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "the ability of such measurements to constrain models , in a broad sense , is inversely proportional to the overlap between the distribution of statistics predicted by different theories for a finite galaxy survey .",
    "more precisely , maximum likelihood methods give the probability of the particular measurements for each theory , or after inversion , the likelihood of the theories themselves .",
    "this is an especially natural and fruitful procedure for a gaussian distribution , where the first two moments are sufficient for a full statistical description .",
    "this simple case is assumed for most analyses in the literature , and it motivates the special attention given to the investigation of the errors , or standard deviations . in general , however , the underlying distribution of measurements can be strongly non - gaussian , in which case the correct shape for the distribution has to be employed for a maximum likelihood analysis . as a consequence , terms such as `` @xmath17-@xmath18 measurement '' loose their usual meaning : a few @xmath18 deviation from the average can be quite likely for a non - gaussian distribution with a long tail .",
    "therefore it is of utmost importance to ask two important questions :    1 .   in what regime",
    "is the gaussian approximation valid for the distribution of the measured statistical quantities ? 2 .",
    "if the gaussian limit is violated , is there any reasonably simple , practical assumption which would enable a maximum likelihood analysis ?",
    "this paper attempts to answer these questions by studying numerically the underlying distribution function of measurements for estimators of higher order statistics based on counts - in - cells .",
    "this complements the thorough numerical investigation of the errors undertaken by colombi et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter paper i ) , and the theoretical investigation of the errors exposed in a suite of papers by szapudi & colombi ( 1996 , hereafter sc ) , colombi , szapudi , & szalay ( 1998 , hereafter css ) , and szapudi , colombi , & bernardeau ( 1999 , hereafter scb ) .    for a particular statistic @xmath3",
    ", @xmath2 denotes the probability density of measuring a value @xmath4 in a finite galaxy catalog .",
    "we consider the following counts - in - cells statistics : factorial moments @xmath7 , cumulants @xmath8 and @xmath9 , void probability @xmath19 and its corresponding scaling function @xmath20 , as well the counts - in - cells distribution itself , @xmath6 . a large @xmath0cdm @xmath1-body experiment , @xmath21 , generated by the virgo consortium ( e.g. , evrard et al .  1999 )",
    "was divided into @xmath22 cubic subsamples , @xmath23 , @xmath24 for estimating numerically the cosmic distribution function , @xmath2 .",
    "this was rendered possible by the fact that this `` hubble volume '' simulation involves @xmath25 particles in a cubic box of size @xmath26 mpc . a detailed description of the simulation and the method we used to extract count - in - cells statistics in the full box @xmath21 and its each of subsamples @xmath23 can be found in paper i.    paper i concentrated entirely on the first two moments of @xmath2 , the average @xmath27 and the cosmic error @xmath28 in the equations above",
    ", the mean @xmath29 can differ from the true value .",
    "the cosmic bias is defined as @xmath30 it is always present when indicators are constructed from unbiased estimators in a nonlinear fashion , such as cumulants ( e.g. , sbc ; hui & gaztaaga 1998 , hereafter hg ) .",
    "the most relevant results of paper i are summarized next :    1 .   is in excellent agreement with perturbation theory , one - loop perturbation theory and extended perturbation theory ( ept ) in their respective range of applicability .",
    "these tests demonstrate the quality of our numerical experiment .",
    "2 .   is in accord with the theoretical predictions of sc and sbc in their respective domain of validity .",
    "a few percent accuracy is achieved in the weakly non - linear regime for the factorial moments . on small scales",
    "the theory tends to overestimate the errors , perhaps by a factor of two in the worst case , due to the approximate nature of the hierarchical models representing the joint moments ( scb ) .",
    "3 .   is negligible compared to the errors in the full dynamic range , as predicted by theory ( scb , see also hg for an opposing view ) .",
    "4 .   are in general agreement with theory considering the preliminary nature of the measurements .",
    "the precision of the predictions , however , decreases with increasing difference of orders , @xmath31 .",
    "this suggests that the local poisson model ( sc ) looses accuracy , as expected .    the theory of the errors confirmed by paper i provides an excellent basis for future maximum likelihood analyses of data whenever @xmath5 is gaussian .",
    "while this was tacitly assumed by most previous works , this article examines for the first time the range of validity of this assumption . to this end",
    "the cosmic distribution function @xmath2 is examined numerically .",
    "in particular , one of the parameters determining its shape , the cosmic skewness @xmath32 is calculated as well .",
    "when gaussianity is no longer a good approximation , new anstze are proposed for characterizing @xmath2 .",
    "in addition we perform a preliminary analysis of the bivariate cosmic distributions @xmath10 .",
    "the next section presents the estimates of @xmath5 for the factorial moments , the cumulants ( including the variance of the counts ) , the void probability distribution and its scaling function , and the counts - in - cells themselves .",
    "a universal shape is found for @xmath2 which is well described in all regimes by a generalized version of the lognormal distribution .",
    "in addition to the mean ( [ eq : mean ] ) and variance ( [ eq : variance ] ) , this depends on a third parameter , the cosmic skewness ( [ eq : cskew ] ) .",
    "this is also investigated along with the resulting _ effective cosmic bias_. section 3 presents the measured bivariate distributions , with explicit comparison to theoretical predictions of scb .",
    "finally , section 4 discusses the results in the context of maximum likelihood analysis of future surveys .",
    "readers unfamiliar with counts - in - cells statistics can consult appendix  a in paper i for a concise summary of definitions and notation .",
    "the main results of this section are displayed in figures 16 . for simplicity figures 1 , 3 , and 5",
    "will be referred to as type d , displaying distributions , while figures 2 , 4 , and 6 as type s , showing skewness . a general description of each type is followed by results obtained for the cosmic distribution of the factorial moments (   2.1 ) , cumulants (   3.2 ) , counts - in - cells (   2.3 ) , and void probability with its scaling function @xmath18 (   2.4 ) . the cosmic skewness and the resulting effective bias",
    "are discussed in   2.5 .",
    "in all figures of type d , the results are displayed in a convenient system of coordinates . for any statistic @xmath4 the normalized quantity @xmath33",
    "is considered where @xmath34 to simplify notations .",
    "the average of @xmath35 is zero and its variance is unity by definition which facilitates the comparison of the plots .",
    "the disadvantage of this coordinate system is that the cosmic error @xmath36 is not directly shown .    for reference ,",
    "each figure of type d displays a gaussian ( solid curve ) , and lognormal distribution with the same variance and average ( dots , e.g.  coles & jones 1991 ) : @xmath37 ^ 2}{2 \\kappa }    \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : lognor}\\ ] ] with @xmath38.\\ ] ] the skewness of this distribution is given by @xmath39 for comparison , the skewness of the lognormal assumption is plotted with dotted lines on figures of type s. the amount of skewness of the lognormal is a function of the cosmic error , i.e. more skewness on the figures indicates a larger cosmic error which is hidden by the choice of the coordinate system .",
    "in addition , a `` generalized lognormal distribution '' is introduced ( dashes on figures of type d ) : @xmath40   \\sqrt { 2\\pi \\eta } } \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\times \\exp\\left ( - \\frac { \\ { \\ln[s ( { \\tilde{a}}-a)/\\delta a+1]+\\eta/2 \\}^2}{2 \\eta }    \\right ) , \\label{eq : lognor2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "it is fixed by the requirement that the analytical function ( [ eq : lognor2 ] ) have identical average , variance , and skewness , @xmath43 , with the measured @xmath2 .",
    "it has more parameters , thus form ( [ eq : lognor2 ] ) characterizes the shape of function @xmath2 better than the other two functions , especially for the large @xmath44 tail .",
    "as will be shown next , it is an excellent approximation for the underlying probability distribution _ in all regimes for all statistics_. this robust universality is the most striking result of this article .",
    "the cosmic distribution function , as with any measurement from finite data , is subject to both measurement and cosmic errors ( the `` error on the error problem '' , cf . sc ) .",
    "the measurement error on @xmath5 , due to the finite number of subsamples extracted from the whole simulation , can be calculated via straightforward error propagation .",
    "it essentially corresponds to the usual @xmath45 factor , where @xmath46 is the number of subsamples .",
    "this is plotted on all figures of type d as errorbars . on figures of type",
    "s no errorbars are shown , since this would require an accurate estimate up to the 6th moment of the cosmic distribution @xmath2 . the excellent agreement between cosmic error measurements and theory ( paper i ) indicates that the number of subsamples is sufficient and thus the resulting errorbars should be fairly small .",
    "similar arguments suggest that the simulation volume was sufficient large to render the cosmic error on the cosmic distribution negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure10 ] displays @xmath12 for @xmath47    and various scales @xmath48 , @xmath49 mpc .",
    "the agreement with the generalized lognormal distribution is excellent , but even the lognormal gives an adequate description .",
    "the deviation from a gaussian is pronounced whenever the relative cosmic error @xmath50 is significantly larger than unity . while the figures do not show the cosmic error directly",
    ", the skewness of @xmath12 is a reliable indication .",
    "it increases with the order @xmath14 since @xmath50 also increases with @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure11 ] shows directly the quantity @xmath51 measured for    @xmath52 along with the lognormal value ( [ eq : slognor ] ) .",
    "the agreement shows that the lognormal model yields an excellent approximation .",
    "[ fig : figure10 ] in conjunction with the measurements of the cosmic error in paper i suggests that @xmath53 is a practical criterion for the validity of the gaussian approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure12 ] is analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : figure10 ] ,    showing functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the biased estimators .",
    "as was shown in paper i , the bias is negligible compared to the cosmic errors , thus correction is not necessary .",
    "the agreement with the lognormal is more approximate than for @xmath12 , except for the variance @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , the skewness of @xmath13 is in general different from the lognormal prediction , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : figure13 ] . on small scales",
    "it is larger than predicted by equation  ( [ eq : slognor ] ) while on large scales where edge effects dominate it is much smaller .",
    "the generalized lognormal ( [ eq : lognor2 ] ) can still account for the shape of @xmath13 quite well , especially for the large @xmath58 tail .",
    "the cosmic skewness of @xmath59 is fairly small on large scales .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that cumulants are not subject to the positivity constraint @xmath60 , as it is the case for factorial moments . on large scales ,",
    "the measured @xmath61 may well be positive or negative , similarly with @xmath8 on extremely large scales . as a result ,",
    "the left - hand tail of the distribution is more pronounced in both lower right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure12 ] than the corresponding figure for factorial moments , and @xmath62 is almost gaussian in the middle right panel .",
    "rule ( [ eq : rule ] ) for the gaussian limit still applies , at least for @xmath8 , and perhaps a slightly more stringent condition should be chosen for cumulants of higher order .",
    "@xmath55 is fairly skewed even though the measured cosmic error is slightly below the threshold value for @xmath63 mpc and @xmath64 mpc ( see paper i ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure14 ] shows the function @xmath15 in various cases .",
    "the upper panels focus on a small scale @xmath65 mpc . in this regime ,",
    "the cpdf and @xmath66 are decreasing functions of @xmath1 as demonstrated in paper i. once again , the validity of the gaussian approximation depends on the size of cosmic error . as a result , @xmath15 is nearly gaussian for @xmath67 and becomes more and more skewed as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the lognormal approximation appears to be adequate within the errors , although it is slightly too skewed as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : figure15 ] .",
    "the middle panels show an intermediate scale @xmath68 mpc . on these scales",
    "( cf . paper i ) both the cpdf and the cosmic error have a unimodal behaviour with an extremum ( maximum for the cpdf and correspondingly minimum for the errors ) for @xmath69 .",
    "this explains why for the chosen values of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , function @xmath15 is skewed , approximately gaussian , and skewed again respectively . for @xmath70 lognormal",
    "is an excellent approximation , while the skewness for @xmath73 is somewhat less than that of a lognormal .",
    "finally , the lower panels display the largest available scale @xmath74 mpc .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath6 and @xmath75 is similar as previously with the extremum shifted to @xmath76 . in this case ,",
    "the cosmic error is always large , at least of order fifty percent ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .",
    "all the curves are thus significantly skewed for the chosen values of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the agreement with the lognormal assumption is somewhat inaccurate , although the generalized lognormal improves the fit , especially for the left - hand panel .",
    "note that the apparently abrupt limit for small values of @xmath80 is due to the positivity constraint @xmath81 .",
    "this constraint becomes quite severe when the average value is much smaller than the errors . while there is still plenty of dynamic range for upscattering ,",
    "there is a hard restriction for down scattering .",
    "this is only partly taken into account in our generalized lognormal model , and any modifications in this respect are left for future work . finally , the practical criterion ( [ eq : rule ] ) is again valid for determining gaussian approximation .",
    "note that the finite number @xmath82 of sampling cells ( see paper i ) , the cpdf is necessarily a multiple of @xmath83 .",
    "this quantization could cause contamination of @xmath15 unless @xmath84 .",
    "the condition @xmath85 adopted corresponds to at least @xmath86 cells per subsample in average with @xmath1 particles . despite that",
    ", a small amount of contamination might still persist for @xmath87 , i.e. at the left side of the plots on figure  [ fig : figure14 ] . the same effect might also alter the tail of the counts - in - cells measurements presented in paper i , although not significantly .",
    "according to the investigations in paper i , the cosmic error on @xmath19 and @xmath18 increases steadily with scale up to a sudden transition on scales @xmath88 mpc where it becomes large or infinite .",
    "this behavior was studied extensively by cbs where more of the details can be found .",
    "the most relevant consequence here is that in the available dynamic range the cosmic error is small , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are nearly gaussian .",
    "for this reason it would be superfluous to print the corresponding figures .      according to figs .",
    "[ fig : figure10][fig : figure15 ] , the degree of skewness of the cosmic distribution function increases with the order @xmath14 and with @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the value for which @xmath6 reaches its maximum .",
    "the cosmic skewness is already significant for third order statistics , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "an important consequence of the large cosmic skewness is that the maximum @xmath2 , i.e. the most likely measurement , is shifted to the left from the ensemble average on figs .",
    "[ fig : figure10 ] , [ fig : figure12 ] and [ fig : figure14 ] . maximizing the ansatz ( [ eq : lognor2 ] ) , which is always a good fit to the cosmic distribution function , yields @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the _ effective",

    "similarly to the cosmic bias ( sbc ) , @xmath101 from expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : biasln ] ) in the small error regime .",
    "the phenomenon of effective bias was already pointed out by sc ( and preliminarily investigated by colombi , bouchet & schaeffer , 1994 ) . since @xmath102 is the most likely value of @xmath4 , the only one available measurement in a catalog of the neighbouring universe is likely to yield lower than average value .",
    "this is true even for an unbiased indicator such as @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "unfortunately , this effect can not be corrected for , but it can be taken into account in the framework of the maximum likelihood approach using the above results on the shape of @xmath2 .",
    "figures  [ fig : figurebiv1 ] and [ fig : figurebiv2 ] display contours of the joint cosmic distribution @xmath10 ( solid lines ) for factorial moments and cumulants , respectively . for comparison the gaussian limit is shown , @xmath105,\\ ] ] @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the cross - correlation coefficient .",
    "dot - dashes display the above function with the measured @xmath108 , @xmath36 and @xmath109 , while long dashes represent the same function but with the parameters inferred from the theory of scb with the e@xmath110pt model ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "the contours , correspond in the gaussian limit to the 1@xmath18 ( thin curves ) level , @xmath111 , and the 2@xmath18 ( thick curves ) level , @xmath112 , are displayed in the coordinate system of the measured @xmath35 and @xmath113 .",
    "on @xmath114 mpc scales the theoretical predictions are expected to match the second order moments of @xmath5 for factorial moments , and even the cross - correlations ( see paper i ) .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : figurebiv1 ] , where the long - dashed ellipses superpose well to the dot - dashed ones . for the cumulants the theory overestimates the errors slightly , which is reflected in the contours of fig .",
    "[ fig : figurebiv2 ] , although cross - correlations are still reasonable , as indicated by the orientation of the ellipses .",
    "the departure from the gaussian limit is significant , except for the upper left panel on figs .",
    "[ fig : figurebiv1 ] and [ fig : figurebiv2 ] , and increases with order , in accord with the findings of the previous section .",
    "the contrast with gaussianity increases with the cosmic error , and thus with the order considered . with the exception of @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath8 and @xmath94 ,",
    "the measured cosmic error violates ( [ eq : rule ] ) at @xmath114 mpc ( see paper i ) .",
    "moreover , as shown previously , criterion ( [ eq : rule ] ) should be strengthened for cumulants @xmath117 , @xmath118 . in conclusion ,",
    "condition ( [ eq : rule ] ) distinguishes the gaussian limit for @xmath10 adequately when applied to both statistics @xmath4 and @xmath119 .",
    "similarly to the monovariate distribution (   2 ) , function @xmath10 develops skewness and a significant tail for large values of @xmath120 when rule ( [ eq : rule ] ) is broken .",
    "there are three notable consequences :    1 .",
    "the effective cosmic bias (   2.5 ) is present again , i.e. the maximum of @xmath5 is shifted from the average towards the lower left corner of the panels . 2 .",
    "the contours tend to cover a smaller area than for the gaussian limit .",
    "3 .   as a result of the positivity constraint ,",
    "there is a well defined lower vertical / horizontal bound in some panels , e.g. , for @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "this paper has presented an experimental study of the cosmic distribution function of measurements @xmath2 , where @xmath4 is an indicator of a statistic related to counts - in - cells .",
    "the cosmic distribution was considered for the factorial moments @xmath7 , cumulants @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the void probability @xmath19 with its scaling function , @xmath20 , and finally the counts - in - cells @xmath6 themselves . to analyse properties of the function @xmath2",
    ", we used a state of the art @xmath0cdm simulation divided into 4096 sub - cubes large enough themselves to represent a full galaxy catalog .",
    "the statistics mentioned above were extracted from each subsample , and the resulting distribution of measurements was used to estimate @xmath2 .    while paper i concentrated on the first two moments of the cosmic distribution , the average and the errors , here the focus was shifted towards the general shape of function @xmath5 itself , including its skewness , the cosmic skewness .",
    "the main results of this analysis are the followings :    1 .",
    "in contrast with popular belief , the cosmic distribution is _ not gaussian _ in general .",
    "the most reassuring result is , however , that the gaussian approximation appears to be valid whenever the cosmic errors are small , typically @xmath11 .",
    "this result is quite robust and it is insensitive to the particular statistic considered ( except that a slightly more stringent condition might be chosen for cumulants @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) .",
    "this means that for any quantity which can be reliably measured from a survey , a gaussian error analysis should be valid .",
    "+ when the relative cosmic error @xmath36 becomes significant , @xmath5 becomes increasingly skewed . since @xmath50 and @xmath123 increase with @xmath14 ( sc , paper i ) , and @xmath75 with @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the maximum of the cpdf , so does the cosmic skewness , which eventually results in the break down of the gaussian approximation .",
    "functions @xmath12 and @xmath54 are well approximated by a lognormal law .",
    "otherwise , a third order parametrisation matching the average , the variance and the skewness of the observed distribution is necessary , and in general sufficient .",
    "such a generalization of lognormal distribution is proposed and found to be in agreement with the measurements in all regimes investigated .",
    "note that there are other alternatives such as the edgeworth expansion ( e.g. , juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 ) or the skewed lognormal approximation of colombi ( 1994 ) .",
    "this latter consists of applying edgeworth expansion to @xmath124 .",
    "this method , when applicable , improves significantly the domain of validity of the edgeworth expansion , normally only useful in the weakly non - gaussian limit @xmath125 .",
    "2 .   while paper i examined the cosmic bias resulting from the non - linear construction of certain estimators , here a new phenomenon was pointed out , which is similar in effect , but different in nature : the _ effective cosmic bias_. it affects all estimators , including unbiased ones , and is a result of the cosmic skewness .",
    "whenever the cosmic errors are large , the cosmic distribution function develops a skewness corresponding to a long tail . as a result",
    ", the most likely measurement will be smaller than the average .",
    "such a phenomenon was pointed out earlier in sc , and here it has been found to be universal . as scb and paper i found that the cosmic bias is usually insignificant compared to the cosmic errors , it is likely that the effective cosmic bias is responsible for some of the conspicuously low measurements from small galaxy catalogs .",
    "this is in contrast with the conjecture of hui & gaztaaga ( 1998 , hereafter hg ) , who assumed that the cosmic bias resulting from the use of biased estimators could explain this phenomenon .",
    "the effective cosmic bias renders correction for the cosmic bias useless , in contrast with the proposition of hg .",
    "the effective cosmic bias ( and the less significant cosmic bias if any ) can be taken into account in the framework of a full maximum likelihood analysis , which relies on the shape of the cosmic distribution function approximated with sufficient accuracy .",
    "a preliminary investigation of joint distribution @xmath10 was performed for factorial moments and cumulants .",
    "it confirms the validity of the above points ( i ) and ( ii ) for cosmic bivariate distribution .",
    "in particular , a practical criterion for the validity of the gaussian limit is that the cosmic error for both estimators be small enough , typically @xmath11 and @xmath126 .",
    "this result can be safely generalized to @xmath1-variate distribution functions , thus providing the basis of full multivariate maximum likelihood analysis of data in the gaussian limit .",
    "+ we have not attempted to develop a more accurate multivariate approximation than ( multivariate ) gaussian as this would go beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we conjecture that an extension of our generalized lognormal distribution would be feasible ( see the point of view of sheth , 1995 )",
    ". an alternate approach , proposed by amendola ( 1996 ) , would employ a multivariate edgeworth expansion .",
    "however , similarly with point ( i ) above for monovariate distributions , this approximation is only valid when the errors are small ; but this is precisely the criterion for the gaussian limit as we shown previously . a generalization of the lognormal distribution expanding the logarithm of the statistics via the multivariate edgeworth technique provides a potential improvement of this method .",
    "it is worth noting that the behaviour of the cosmic distribution function is expected to be extremely robust with respect to the particular model studied in this paper , @xmath0cdm .",
    "for example , sc , in their preliminary investigations , found essentially the same universal behaviour in rayleigh - levy fractals .",
    "moreover , as discussed more extensively in paper i , the results are sufficiently stable that the usual worries of galaxy biasing ( not to be confused with cosmic and effective cosmic bias ) and redshift distortions are unlikely to change them qualitatively .",
    "indeed the shape of the cosmic distribution function is almost entirely determined by the magnitude of the cosmic error , and it is insensitive to which statistic is considered . the powerful universality found among entirely different statistics is likely to carry over when the two effects mentioned above , which are subtleties in comparison with the range of statistics investigated , are taken into account .    the results found in the present work and in paper i are encouraging for investigations in future large galaxy catalogs and for problems related to data compression ( e.g. bond 1995 ; vogeley & szalay 1996 ; tegmark , taylor & heavens 1996 ; bond , jaffe & knox 1998 ; seljak 1998 ) .",
    "for example , the cosmic error on factorial moments is expected to be small on a large dynamic range in the sdss ( see , e.g.  css ) , implying according to the above findings that the cosmic distribution function should be nearly gaussian in this regime . in that case ,",
    "theory of the cosmic errors and cross - correlations , outlined in sc , css and scb and thoroughly tested in paper i , will be sufficient for full multivariate maximum likelihood analyses .",
    "preliminary investigations on current surveys are being undertaken by szapudi , colombi & bernardeau ( 1999b ) and bouchet , colombi & szapudi ( 1999 ) .",
    "similarly the theoretical background is currently being developed for future weak lensing surveys ( berneardeau , colombi , szapudi , 1999 ) , where statistical analyses will be conducted with indicators very close to counts - in - cells ( see , e.g. bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; mellier 1998 ; jain , seljak & white 1999 ) .",

    "<S> colombi et al . 1999 ( paper i ) investigated the counts - in - cells statistics and their respective errors in the @xmath0cdm virgo hubble volume simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this extremely large @xmath1-body experiment also allows a numerical investigation of the _ cosmic distribution function _ , @xmath2 itself for the first time . for a statistic @xmath3 , @xmath2 is the probability density of measuring the value @xmath4 in a finite galaxy catalog . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 was evaluated for the distribution of counts - in - cells , @xmath6 , the factorial moments , @xmath7 , and the cumulants , @xmath8 and @xmath9 s , using the same subsamples as paper i.    while paper i concentrated on the first two moments of @xmath5 , i.e. the mean , the cosmic error and the cross - correlations , here the function @xmath5 is studied in its full generality , including a preliminary analysis of joint distributions @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant , and reassuring result for the analyses of future galaxy data is that the cosmic distribution function is nearly gaussian provided its variance is small . </S>",
    "<S> a good practical criterion for the relative cosmic error is that @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for accurate measurements , the theory of the cosmic errors , presented by szapudi & colombi ( 1996 ) and szapudi , colombi & bernardeau ( 1999 ) , and confirmed empirically by paper i , is sufficient for a full statistical description and thus for a maximum likelihood rating of models . as the cosmic error increases , </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic distribution function @xmath5 becomes increasingly skewed and is well described by a generalization of the lognormal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic skewness is introduced as an additional free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from gaussianity of @xmath12 and @xmath13 increases with order @xmath14 , @xmath1 , and similarly for @xmath15 when @xmath1 is far from the maximum of @xmath6 , or when the scale approaches the size of the catalog . for our particular experiment , @xmath12 and @xmath16 </S>",
