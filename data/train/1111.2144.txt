    "the solar cycle is not regular .",
    "there were several grand minima like the maunder minimum during which the activity level was extremely low .",
    "although the solar activity has varied approximately cyclically since the maunder minimum , the amplitudes and the periods of individual cycles varied in an irregular manner .",
    "another important feature of solar cycles is the waldmeier effect , which is basically the anti - correlation between the rise time and the peak sunspot number .",
    "however , we define two different aspects of it , which we call we1 and we2 . by we1",
    "we refer to the anti - correlation between the _ rise time _ and the peak sunspot number , whereas by we2 we refer to the positive correlation between the _ rise rate _ and the peak sunspot number .",
    "our motivation is to model the irregularities of the solar cycle , including features like the waldmeier effect , by using the flux transport dynamo model ( see choudhuri 2011 and references therein ) . in this model , the toroidal field",
    "is generated near the base of the convection zone by differential rotation and the poloidal field is generated near the solar surface by the decay of tilted bipolar sunspots .",
    "these two source regions are connected to each other by several transport agents .",
    "one important flux transport agent in this model is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , its value in the whole convection zone is not properly constrained .",
    "this has led to two different classes of models , in which the diffusivity has been taken to be high or low ( see jiang , chatterjee & choudhuri 2007 ; choudhuri 2011 )",
    ". the values of @xmath0 in these two classes of models are taken in the ranges @xmath1 @xmath2 s@xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath2 s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "another important flux transport agent in this model is the meridional circulation .",
    "the present understanding of its origin  and , more importantly , its fluctuations  is very primitive .",
    "it is believed that the the meridional circulation arises from a slight imbalance between two large terms ( the centrifugal force due to the variation of angular velocity with distance from the equatorial plane and the thermal wind due to a temperature variation with latitude ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that there may be random variations in the due to stochastic fluctuations in any one of these driving forces . only since 1990s we have some observational data of  near the surface .",
    "therefore we do not know whether it had large variations in the past .",
    "however , we can get some idea of the variations of the  from the observed periods of the past solar cycles . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how this is done by using the flux transport dynamo model and then we model solar cycles using the variable meridional circulation .",
    "we know that the period of the cycle in the flux transport dynamo model is primarily determined by the strength of the   ( dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ) . a stronger  makes the dynamo period shorter",
    ". therefore it should be possible to match the observed periods of the last 23 solar cycles by using a variable .",
    "karak ( 2010 ) performed this experiment using a high diffusivity model based on the model of chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri ( 2004 ) .",
    "[ fit23](a ) shows the variation of the amplitude of  required to match the periods of last 23 solar cycles . from this figure",
    ", we see that the  varied significantly with time .",
    "therefore , if the flux transport dynamo model is the correct model for the solar cycle , then we have to conclude that the  had large variations in the past .",
    "now let us look at the variation of theoretical sunspot number obtained by karak ( 2010 ) shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fit23](b ) . for comparison ,",
    "the observed sunspot number is shown by the solid line .",
    "surprisingly , most of the theoretical sunspot cycle amplitudes are matched with the observed ones .",
    "we do get a good correlation between these two as shown in fig .",
    "[ fit23](c ) .",
    "this is a very important result of this analysis because our motivation was only to match the solar cycle periods and to get some idea of the variation of  in the past .",
    "however , while doing this , we find that most of the solar cycle amplitudes are also matched to some extent .",
    "therefore , this study suggests that a significant amount of fluctuations in the strengths of the cycles is arising from the variations in the , which seems important in modelling not only the solar cycle periods but also the cycle amplitudes .",
    "( in m  s@xmath3 ) with time ( in yr ) .",
    "the solid line is the variation of @xmath5 used to match the theoretical periods with the observed periods .",
    "( b ) variation of theoretical sunspot number ( dashed line ) and observed sunspot number ( solid line ) with time .",
    "( c ) scatter diagram showing peak theoretical sunspot number and peak observed sunspot number . from karak ( 2010).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    now let us explain the physics of this result based on the arguments given by yeates , nandy & mackay ( 2008 ) . we know",
    "that in the flux transport dynamo , the production of the toroidal field is more if the poloidal field remains in the tachocline for longer time and vice versa .",
    "however , the poloidal field also diffuses during its transport through the convection zone . as a result ,",
    "if the diffusivity is very high , then much of the poloidal field diffuses away and not much of it reaches the tachocline to induct the toroidal field . therefore ,",
    "when we decrease @xmath5 in high diffusivity model to match the period of a longer cycle , the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse during its transport through the convection zone .",
    "this ultimately leads to a lesser generation of toroidal field and hence the cycle becomes weaker . on the other hand ,",
    "when we increase the value of @xmath5 to match the period of a shorter cycle , the poloidal field does not get much time to diffuse in the convection zone .",
    "hence it produces stronger toroidal field and the cycle becomes stronger .",
    "consequently , we get weaker amplitudes for longer periods and vice versa .",
    "however , this is not the case in low diffusivity model because in this model the diffusive decay of the fields is not very important . as a result",
    ", the slower @xmath5 means that the poloidal field remains in the tachocline for longer time and therefore it produces more toroidal field , giving rise to a strong cycle .",
    "therefore , we do not get the correct correlation between the amplitudes of theoretical sunspot number and those of observed sunspot number when we repeat the same analysis in the low diffusivity model .",
    "next we present some results from karak & choudhuri ( 2011 ) , who studied the  using the flux transport dynamo model .",
    "the stochastic fluctuations in the  process of generating poloidal field and the stochastic fluctuations in the  are the two main sources of irregularities in this model .",
    "therefore , to study the , we first introduce suitable stochastic fluctuations in the poloidal field source term .",
    "[ pol ] shows the result .",
    "we see that this study can not reproduce we1 ( fig .",
    "[ pol](a ) ) , although it reproduces we2 ( fig .",
    "[ pol](b ) ) .",
    "next we introduce stochastic fluctuations in the meridional circulation .",
    "[ mc ] shows this result .",
    "we see that both we1 and we2 are remarkably reproduced in this case .",
    "however , when we repeat the same study with the low diffusivity model of dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) , we fail to reproduce we1 .",
    "only we2 is reproduced in this model .",

    "( b ) the butterfly diagram . from karak ( 2010).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "karak ( 2010 ) found that a decrease of the  to a very low value can reproduce a maunder - like grand minimum .",
    "[ mm](a ) shows the variation of @xmath5 required to model a maunder - like grand minimum .",
    "[ mm](b ) shows the butterfly diagram of sunspot numbers .",
    "this result reproduces most of the features of the maunder minimum remarkably well .",
    "we have shown that the temporal variation of the meridional circulation is important in modelling irregularities of the solar cycle .",
    "our studies also suggest that there have been large variations in the  in the past . with suitable stochastic fluctuations in the meridional circulation , we are able to reproduce many important irregular features of the solar cycle including the waldmeier effect and maunder - like grand minima",
    ". however we fail to reproduce these results in a low diffusivity model .",
    "therefore this study along with some other studies ( chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri 2004 ; chatterjee & choudhuri 2006 ; jiang , chatterjee & choudhuri 2007 ; choudhuri & karak 2009 ; goel & choudhuri 2009 ; hotta & yokoyama 2010 ; karak & choudhuri 2012 ) supports the high diffusivity model for the solar cycle .",
