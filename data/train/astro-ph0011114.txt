    "oh maser emission from the four ground - state transitions at 1612.231 , 1665.402 , 1667.359 and 1720.530 mhz occurs in a wide range of objects . extra  galactic oh  maser emission is associated with active galactic nuclei and enhanced central star formation ( baan & haschick 1987 ; randell 1995 ) , with strongest emission , in general , from the main lines at 1665/1667 mhz .",
    "oh maser emisson from galactic star forming regions ( sfrs ) is also strongest in the main lines , with dominant emission mostly at 1665 mhz .",
    "the satellite line at 1720 mhz is best known for its occurence in supernova remnants , whereas that at 1612 mhz is strongest in the optically  thick envelopes of oxygen  rich asymptotic  giant ",
    "branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "mainline oh emission may be present in optically  thin envelopes ; from nearby mira variables , with low mass - loss rates around 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , only mainline emission is detected .    at the end of the agb evolutionary phase , the star undergoes a transformation which takes a couple of thousand years , during which it evolves to become a planetary nebula ( pn ) . during this post - agb stage , the mass - loss rate decreases by a factor of 1000 or more whilst the stellar surface temperature rises by a factor of 10 or 20 to above 50,000 k. the star changes from losing mass in a cool , dense wind to losing mass in a much hotter , lower density wind",
    ".    strong changes also occur in the envelope kinematics and morphologies .",
    "in particular , whilst the circumstellar envelopes of agb stars are generally spherically symmetric , images of planetary nebulae show axi - symmetric morphologies in over 50% of cases ( manchado 2000 ) .    during",
    "the initial searches in the 1970s it was quickly found that  emission was not detected from agb stars .",
    "as this agreed with theoretical expectations ( eg .  elitzur , goldreich & scoville 1976 ) , there have been no systematic searches for this maser in stellar sources . however , it is imaginable that the shocks in some post  agb stars could temporarily induce  maser emission .",
    "we therefore decided to observe , for the first time , a modest sample of selected sources , including post ",
    "agb objects , at 1720 mhz .",
    "a total of 18 objects were selected from sevenster ( 1997a , b ) on the basis of their unusual oh 1612mhz profiles .",
    "observations in all four ground ",
    "state oh transitions were taken with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in november 1998 ( 1612 , 1665 and 1667 mhz ) and september 1999 ( 1720 mhz ) .",
    "eleven of the sources are likely post  agb objects .    the full results from this study will be published separately . here",
    "we report the detection of 1720 mhz from the source  ( iras 18043@xmath42116 ) . in 2 , we present the observations and in 3 the evidence that  is a post  agb object . in 4",
    "we discuss a possible scenario for the  excitation .",
    "conclusions are given in 5 .",
    "figure  shows the oh spectra for  ( 18:07:20.9 , @xmath421:16:10.9 ( j2000 ) ) , observed with a channel width of 0.7 .",
    "the maser emission is strongest at 1612 mhz , with a peak flux density of 11.0 jy at 71.2 .",
    "the spectral profile has a ` one - sided ' peak and a much weaker feature at 101 .",
    "the  emission covers the same velocity range as the  emission ( ) , with a peak flux density of 1.64 jy at 71.3 .",
    "no emission was detected at 1667 mhz with a detection limit of @xmath5 80 mjy .",
    "the  emission is seen as a single narrow peak at a slightly more blue - shifted velocity than the  and the  peaks .",
    "the peak flux density is 1.22 jy at 69.4 , with no linear polarization .",
    "the positional coincidence ( 0.3 ) of the emission in all three lines is consistent with a single point source , given the atca resolution ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we also searched for radio  continuum emission at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz with no detection at the source position , resulting in an upper flux limit of 1.5 mjy ( five-@xmath6 ) .    -6.5truecm",
    "we consider it extremely unlikely that  is associated with either a sfr or a supernova remnant .",
    "no known supernova remnant is associated with the  position and the presence of the other two oh masers precludes such a classification ( eg .",
    "koralesky 1998 ) .",
    "the non  detection of radio continuum is unfavourable to a classification as a sfr , since most sfrs with oh masers are also strong ( 100mjy ) ultra  compact hii regions ( caswell 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , a non  detection in methanol at 6668 mhz at the position of  ( jim caswell , private communication ) provides an upper limit for methanol  maser emission at which 90% of sfrs would be detected if they show  maser emission ( caswell 1999 ) .",
    "the far - infrared msx and iras colours of @xmath7=@xmath8=0.53 and @xmath9=@xmath10=0.4 is taken from the midcourse space experiment infrared satellite ( msx ) , see http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/ipac/msx/msx.html . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are iras point  source values . ]",
    "are consistent with a classification as a `` high  outflow '' source ( zijlstra 2000 ) .",
    "these sources include both young stellar objects and bipolar post  agb stars with optically thick envelopes .",
    "in the two  colour diagram presented by pottasch ( 1988 ) , of the eight nearest neighbours to , five are pne , one is an oh / ir star and two are galaxies . for , the @xmath9 is bluer than for typical hii regions and far redder than for mira variables .",
    "the high @xmath7 indicates a ( recent ) mass  loss rate of @xmath13  ( van der veen 1995 ) , consistent with an agb or post  agb classification .",
    "the oh spectral profiles strongly suggest that the source is a young post  agb star .",
    "the steep outer edge of the bright  peak is characteristic of oh / ir stars and indicates that the emission arises in a thin , expanding shell .",
    "the raggedness on the inside of the peak suggests that the star is transiting off the agb , with irregular or intermittent mass loss . a very large flux  density ratio between the blue and the red  shifted peak",
    "has previously been seen in post  agb stars , where the red  shifted emission , from the back of the , is absorbed in the small ionized region around the star , as noted by lewis ( 1989 ) .",
    "a similar spectrum is found for ohpn 9 ( zijlstra 1989 ) , which shows radio  continuum emission of 1.4 mjy , that could have gone undetected with our limit of 1.5 mjy .",
    "approximately 50% of pne have radio  continuum emission weaker than this ( e.g.  pottasch 1988 ) .",
    "for an object with an optical depth of one , a @xmath14 of 3000 k , a distance of 5 kpc and an ionization radius of @xmath15 cm , we estimate that the 6cm flux density would be @xmath5 1 mjy .",
    "also consistent with a classification as a young post  agb star are the non  variability of the iras and msx emission from  and the detection of mainline oh emission that is weaker than the emission ( lewis 1989 ) . here",
    "we suggest that the absence of emission may be a signature of the earliest stages of post  agb evolution . in",
    ", the  emission can be stronger than that at 1667 mhz in regions with dust temperatures below 300 k , if the far  infrared spectral index is 2 ( elitzur 1978 ) .",
    "pavlakis & kylafis ( 1996 ) find that , at lower temperatures , the  emission can be stronger also for spectral indices of @xmath51 . for envelopes which have only dilated enough for ambient h@xmath0o  dissociating photons to reach regions with @xmath16300 k , the  maser emission is expected to be weak or absent . with further dilation , the  emission should increase and the  emission weaken .    from the infrared and oh maser properties and the non - detections of methanol  maser and continuum emission , we conclude that  is almost certainly a young post  agb star .",
    "it is very unlikely that the  emission originates from exactly the same regions as the other lines ( see lockett , gauthier & elitzur 1999 ) . in the few sfrs that have been imaged in both satellite masers ,",
    "they come from spatially separate clumps ( caswell 1999 ) . however , the two satellite transitions require conditions similar enough to compete directly , as is seen very clearly by their conjugate behaviour in centaurus a ( van langevelde 1995 ) . during the transition from the agb to the pn phase , temperatures , densities , wind velocity and irradiation change rapidly by orders of magnitude",
    ". a variety of environments must be present in the  and it is possible that locally conditions could favour the  over the  maser .",
    "we hypothesize that the  transition is collisionally excited in a region where shocks are present , at the interaction region between the remnant of the agb superwind phase and the hotter , fast post  agb wind . interacting  wind models usually assume a spherical fast wind colliding with an equatorially  enhanced density distribution of the agb remnant ; another possibility is that a bipolar fast wind pierces into a spherical agb remnant . indeed",
    ", weintraub ( 1998 ) argue that it is likely that shocks occur after the onset of bipolarity and before the nebular envelope is ionized and the masers are destroyed .",
    "a c  type of shock is the only way to create the right conditions for the  maser to exist ( lockett 1999 ) .",
    "the process could be as follows . in the very early post ",
    "agb evolution ( see schnberner & steffen 2000 ) , the wind picks up in velocity to @xmath5 100 , while the mass  loss rate drops significantly . in the first @xmath51000 years",
    ", a shock front of @xmath550  would travel @xmath5 2@xmath1710@xmath18 cm ( see frank & mellema 1994 , their fig.2 : `` swept  up shell '' ; cf .",
    "bujarrabal 1997 , m1@xmath492 ) .",
    "this is well into the regions of the agb envelope where the external radiation field dissociates and ionizes most molecular material ( @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22100 k ) .",
    "( note that 2@xmath1710@xmath18 cm is not resolved by atca at distances beyond 5 kpc . )",
    "the passage of a c  type shock would change the chemistry in this region , forming h@xmath0o and increasing the density by a factor of 10 ( see wardle 1999 ) .",
    "subsequent dissociation of the water by the ambient radiation field sufficiently enhances the oh abundance , while collisions with preferentially ortho",
    " h@xmath0 ( see lockett 1999 ) leave oh in the proper excited state to decay via the transition , provided cooling has also decreased the post  shock temperature to below 125 k ( lockett 1999 ) . with an ionizing rate of @xmath510@xmath23s@xmath3 ( solar vicinity 2@xmath1710@xmath23s@xmath3 , irc+10216 2@xmath1710@xmath24s@xmath3 , glassgold 1999 ) and other parameters as given before , it is feasible that the necessary column density of @xmath252.5@xmath1710@xmath26 @xmath27 can be achieved ( lockett 1999 ; wardle 1999 ) . for this",
    ", we assume the relevant layer has a thickness of @xmath510@xmath18 cm ( the outer radius of the  masing shell of an oh / ir star is typically 10@xmath18 cm , cohen 1989 ) , the post  shock density is 10@xmath28 @xmath21 with oh abundance of 10@xmath29 ( in the  layer this is @xmath510@xmath30 , cohen 1989 ) and the magnetic field at these radii is of the order of 100@xmath31 g ( e.g.  chapman & cohen 1986 )",
    ". these values are realistic , as well as in good agreement with those used by wardle ( 1999 ) .",
    "note that the resulting  maser optical depth would be low , of the order of 4 ( lockett 1999 ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "the  masing regions are located well outside the layers where the  masers arise and along a different  than the  masers .",
    "this means that the usual argument that the  maser can not co  exist with these lines in one circumstellar stellar envelope ( see footnote lockett 1999 ) is not necessarily valid .",
    "the formation of extra water at large radii is not in disagreement with the observation that post  agb objects with main  line emission do not have 22ghz water masers ( lewis 1989 ) as no maser emission is expected from the shock ",
    "produced h@xmath0o ( lockett 1999 ) .",
    "0.2truecm 1truecm    the high  density ( @xmath2510@xmath32 ) regime for  maser emission , as presented in pavlakis & kylafis ( 1996 ) , requires strong velocity gradients ( @xmath52 ; see caswell 1999 for such spectra ) .",
    "as the linewidth for the  maser is 0.5 ( ( ) , typical for velocity gradients in , such a regime appears to be unlikely .",
    "the detection probability for  maser emission from post  agb stars is almost certainly very low for several reasons .",
    "firstly , a c  type shock has to form .",
    "because of the geometry of the shock front and maser beaming effects , it is likely that only around 10% of sources with such shocks will show  emission , as is found for supernova remnants ( lockett 1999 ; koralesky 1998 ; claussen 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the interstellar radiation field has to be strong enough , but not so strong as to increase the electron density ( lockett 1999 ) .",
    "finally , in many objects a bipolar flow is traced by the  line ( eg .",
    "zijlstra 2000 , sahai 1999 ) . in such cases , the physical conditions in the interaction region",
    "can not be suitable for  emission , probably due to large column density or the strength of the local infrared radiation field ( lockett 1999 ) .",
    "circumstellar  maser emission was previously detected from the star v1057 cygni ( lo & bechis 1973 ; winnberg 1981 ) , following an optical / infrared flare in 1970 .",
    "it has been suggested that the  flares occured when shells ejected at different velocities collided with remnant star  forming material and that the masers were collisionally excited ( elitzur 1976 ) .",
    "the maser flares only lasted for @xmath5 18 months , showing that the right conditions for  maser emission may be very short  lived .",
    "long  baseline interferometry of  will be carried out with merlin in the near future and may help establish whether it is the agb superwind or the proto ",
    "planetary wind that is aspherical and causes the wealth of morphologies observed in pne . in our scenario , in the former case , the  masers would be preferentially on the equator of the oh shell , in the latter on its poles .",
    "we predict that this is more likely , given the very narrow width of the  line , compared to the  profile .",
    "on average , the  maser will be located outside the  and  layers , which is in agreement with its slightly higher velocity in an accelerating outflow ( see bujarrabal 1997 ) .",
    "the absence of the red  shifted peak at 1720 mhz suggests that we see the bipolar outflow nearly end  on ( cf .",
    "claussen 1997 ) .",
    "if the object is a post  agb star , measuring zeeman splitting of the narrow  lines would give a measurement of the magnetic field , as has been done for several supernova remnants ( eg .  brogan 2000 ; koralesky 1998 ) , and provide interesting boundary conditions for magneto  hydro  dynamic models ( see garcia  segura , franco & lopez 2000 ) .",
    "finally , we predict that no h@xmath0o  maser emission will be found in this object , but that thermal emission should be detectable given the large column density . several h@xmath0o transitions in the far infrared ( eg",
    ".  179.5@xmath31m,174.5@xmath31 m ) could provide conclusive evidence in favour of the shock  formed water scenario ( kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) , but other shock indicators , such as near ",
    "infrared h@xmath0 transitions may be more practical for observations .",
    "we have detected an oh  maser in a likely post  agb envelope . from theoretical as well as observational arguments ,",
    "it is possible that this maser exists briefly in such environments , at least in some sources .",
    "we argue that the  maser could arise in the region where the agb and the starting pn winds collide .",
    "we expect that this is a short - lived event and that our detection rate of 1/11 is due to favourable small number statistics .",
    "the most likely objects to show this emission may be those that have fairly strong emission at 1612 mhz , with weaker  and possibly sio maser emission , but no  and certainly no h@xmath0o 22ghz maser emission .",
    "we thank mark wardle and jim caswell for very helpful discussions on this work .",
