    "the first millisecond pulsar ( msp ) , which is a rejuvenated old neutron star through accreting matter from its companion , was discovered 30 years ago ( backer et al .",
    "it has long been suggested that they are the descendants of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) . in comparison with the galactic field ,",
    "the formation rate per unit mass of lmxbs in globular clusters ( gcs ) is orders of magnitude higher because of the frequent stellar encounters ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ; pooley et al .",
    "2003 ; hui , cheng & taam 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that gcs should host a large population of msps . since the first cluster msp ,",
    "psr  b1821 - 24 , has been discovered in m28 ( lyne et al .",
    "1987 ) , dedicated radio pulsar surveys towards different clusters have resulted in the currently known population of 144 msps in 28 gcs.pfreire/gcpsr.html for updated information . ]    since the launch of _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , a new population of @xmath4ray emitting globular clusters ( gcs ) have been detected ( abdo et al . 2010a ; tam et al .",
    "as msps are the only known steady @xmath0-ray sources in gcs , they are suggested to be the contributors for the observed emission .",
    "the @xmath0-rays from a gc are interpreted as the collective contribution from the entire pulsar population resides in it ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ; cheng et al .",
    "2010 ; hui et al .",
    "for most of the cluster msps , detecting the @xmath0-ray pulsations is very challenging as the @xmath0-ray flux of individual pulsar is weak . to exacerbate the situation ,",
    "the spatial resolution of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) does not allow individual msps in a gc to be resolved .",
    "this results in a high background that make the pulsation search for any individual msp very difficult . however , there are two notable exceptions , namely the gcs ngc  6624 and m28 .",
    "both of these gcs contain a very energetic and young msp so that they can possibly stand out from the background .    for psr  j1823 - 3021a in ngc  6624 ( @xmath5  ms )",
    ", its large spin - down rate , @xmath6  s  s@xmath7 , implies that it is the youngest msp ( @xmath8  myrs ) ever detected ( freire et al .",
    "its spin - down luminosity is @xmath9  erg  s@xmath7 , which is @xmath10 orders of magnitude greater than the typical msps in gcs ( bogdanov et al .",
    "thanks to the accurate timing model provided by the dedicated radio observations , its @xmath4ray pulsations has been revealed by @xmath11 ( freire et al .",
    "2011 ) . through a phase - resolved analysis",
    ", it has been shown that this single pulsar dominates all the observed @xmath4rays from ngc  6624 ( freire et al .",
    "2011 ) . the @xmath4ray conversion efficiency of psr  j1823 - 3021a , @xmath12 , is found to be comparable with other @xmath4ray detected msps ( abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) , where @xmath13 is the @xmath4ray luminosity .",
    "psr  b1821 - 24 in m28 ( hereafter m28a ) is very similar to psr  j1823 - 3021a in many aspects . its period ( @xmath14  ms ) and spin - down rate ( @xmath15  s  s@xmath7 ) imply its age and spin - down power to be @xmath16  myrs and @xmath17  erg  s@xmath7 respectively , which makes it as the most energetic msp has been found so far ( bogdanov et al .",
    "2011 ) . together with its non - thermal x - ray spectrum ,",
    "its sharp and narrow x - ray pulse profile strongly indicate that most of the observed x - rays from m28a are originated from the magnetosphere .",
    "@xmath4ray emission from m28 has been detected by _",
    "lat ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) . as its @xmath13 is only a fraction of the spin - down power of m28a , it is possible that this pulsar can have a significant contribution to the observed @xmath4rays . together with its relatively short distance , 5.5  kpc ( cf .",
    "harris 1996 ; 2010 version ) , the cluster m28 is a promising target for searching @xmath4ray pulsation . in this letter , we report our recent search for the possible pulsation from this gc by using _",
    "in this work , we used the _ fermi _ lat data between 2008 august 04 and 2012 january 31 .",
    "for the data analysis , the _ fermi _ science tools v9r23p1 package , available from the _ fermi _ science support center , was used .",
    "we used pass 7 data and selected events in the  source \" class ( i.e.  event class 2 ) only .",
    "in addition , we excluded the events with zenith angles larger than 100@xmath18 to greatly reduce the contamination by earth albedo gamma - rays .",
    "the instrumental response functions ( irfs )  p7source_v6 \" were adopted throughout the study .",
    "events were selected within a circular region - of - interest ( roi ) with a diameter of @xmath19 centered at the optical center of m28 .",
    "photon energies are restricted in the range of 200  mev@xmath20300  gev .",
    "this set of cuts is adopted throughout this work .    to investigate the spectral characteristic of m28 with the updated irfs and background model",
    ", we performed an unbinnned likelihood analysis with the aid of _ gtlike _ by assuming a point source with power - law with exponential cutoff ( ple ) of the form @xmath21 at the nominal position of m28 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the photon index and the cutoff energy respectively .",
    "for modeling the background , we included the galactic diffuse model ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ) , the isotropic background ( iso_p7v6source.txt ) , as well as all point sources reported in the 2fgl catalog within @xmath19 from the center of the roi .",
    "all these 2fgl sources were assumed to be point sources which have specific spectrum suggested by the 2fgl catalog ( nolan et al .",
    "while the spectral parameters of the 2fgl sources locate within the roi were set to be free , we kept the parameters for those lying outside our adopted roi fixed at the values given in 2fgl ( nolan et al .",
    "we allowed the normalizations of diffuse background components to be free .",
    "the best - fit ple model is characterized by @xmath24 and @xmath23= 1.41@xmath250.3 gev with a test - statistic ( ts ) value of 825 which is highly significant .",
    "we have tested the robustness of the spectral results by repeating the analysis with different size of roi .",
    "the fitted parameters from independent analysis are consistent within @xmath26 uncertainties . in this model",
    "the photon flux between 200 mev & 300 gev was found to be @xmath27  @xmath28  s@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding integrated energy flux is @xmath29  erg  @xmath28  s@xmath7 .",
    "the spectral results are consistent with those reported by abdo et al .",
    "( 2010a ) within @xmath26 uncertainties .    assuming m28a is major contributor for the @xmath0-rays from m28 , we search for the possible @xmath0-ray pulsation from this gc",
    ". we started by adopting the timing ephemeris determined for m28a from a long term observation with _",
    "x - ray timing explorer ( ray et al .",
    "2008 ) , which are tabulated in table  1 . for barycentric correction",
    ", we used the updated planetary ephemeris jpl de405 throughout this analysis .",
    "following the method proposed by kerr  ( 2011 ) , we used the best - fit model resulted from the phase - averaged likelihood analysis as described above for assigning weight to each @xmath0-ray photon by computing the probability that it originates from m28 .",
    "this enables us to alleviate the problem of source confusion with a more efficient background rejection .",
    "we then assign a pulsar spin phase to every gamma - ray photons with energies @xmath300.2 gev and within 5@xmath31 from m28a s direction ( see tab .  1 ) .",
    "a promising signal with a weighted h - test ts of 28.8 has been found by directly folding up the data with this ephemeris ( de jager & bsching 2010 ) . the folded @xmath4ray pulse profile and the phaseogram ( i.e. pulse phase as a function of time ) with the weighted photons are shown in the upper panel and the lower panel of figure  [ ray_weighted_lc ] respectively .",
    "according to figure  [ ray_weighted_lc ] , it appears to have two peaks with one broader than the other .",
    "we then define the phase - interval for the peak  1 and peak  2 to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the rest is defined as the off - pulse component . with this definition ,",
    "we show the _ fermi _ lat count maps of the sky region around m28 at different phases in figure  [ countmap ] . during the on - pulse intervals , a point - like @xmath4ray",
    "source can be clearly seen at the pulsar position which is illustrated by the yellow cross . on the other hand ,",
    "a faint diffuse excess is found in the off - pulse phase ( i.e. 0.40@xmath340.55 and 0.75@xmath341.0 ) .",
    "however , the limited photon statistic does not allow us to constrain the extent of this putative feature .",
    "this on - and - off nature of the @xmath4ray emission from m28 provides a strong support for the presence of periodic signal and leads us to a more detailed investigation . for investigating the possible spectral variations among peak  1 , peak  2 and the unpulsed component",
    ", we performed a phase - resolved likelihood analysis .",
    "we have fitted their spectra with both simple power - law ( pl ) of the form @xmath35 and ple .",
    "the results are summarized in table  2 . according to the pl fits",
    ", there is no obvious change of the spectral steepness .",
    "we notice that the likelihood analysis that incorporate the ple model results in a higher ts for all three components . for peak  2 , we found that the spectral parameters for the ple fit can not be properly constrained .",
    "therefore , we fixed the photon index at the value inferred in the phase - averaged analysis ( i.e. @xmath36 ) .",
    "same as the cases of the pl fits , within the tolerence of the statistical uncertainties , we do not find any conclusive evidence for the spectral variation across the phase . assuming the off - pulse component has a constant contribution across the whole phase , @xmath37 of the total observed flux is originated from this component .",
    "in this letter , we report our detection of @xmath4ray pulsation from the direction of the gc m28 . we have found a periodic signal which is presumably originated from its energetic msp m28a . based on our phase - resolved analysis",
    ", the pulsed component contributes @xmath3 of the total observed @xmath4rays . at a distance of @xmath38",
    "kpc , this implies an on - pulse luminosity of @xmath39  erg  s@xmath7 , where @xmath40 is the fraction of the sky covered by the @xmath4ray beam . assuming the pulsed emission is originated from m28a",
    ", this suggests a @xmath4ray conversion efficiency of @xmath41 .",
    "some of the msps in the galactic field , such as psrs  j2124 - 3358 and j0437 - 4715 , have their @xmath42 found at this level ( abdo et al .",
    "however , this is lower than @xmath43 as derived from the nearby msps ( abdo et al .",
    "if one adopt this as the intrinsic @xmath4ray conversion efficiency of m28a , this might suggest the observed period derivative is largely dominated by the acceleration of the pulsar along the line - of - sight due to the gravitational field of the cluster .",
    "on the other hand , the off - pulse luminosity is found at the level of @xmath44  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "this estimate is useful for constraining the collective properties of the rest of the msp population in m28 .",
    "for explaining the unpulsed @xmath4ray emission from gcs , there are two main theories .",
    "one stream interprets the @xmath4ray emission from a gc is originated from the collection of the magnetospheric radiation from the entire msp population resides in it ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ; venter et al .",
    "2008,2009 ) . assuming an average spin - down power of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath7 and a characteristic conversion efficiency of @xmath46 , the off - pulse luminosity enables us to estimate the number of the rest msp population to be @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests that about one fifth of the underlying population has already been uncovered .",
    "apart from the aforementioned standard scenario , inverse compton scattering ( ics ) between the relativistic pulsar wind particles and the ambient soft photons has also been proposed as another possible explanation for the origin of the @xmath4ray from gcs ( bednarek & sitarek 2007 ; cheng et al .",
    "2010 ; hui et al .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that the observed @xmath0-ray spectra of gcs can generally be well - modeled by ics between the @xmath48 in the pulsar wind of the whole msp population in a gc and the galactic background ir photons or starlight .",
    "and the two - dimensional regression analysis further suggests @xmath13 , energy density of the background optical / ir photon field and the stellar encounter rate / metallicity span a set of fundamental planes ( hui et al .",
    "the unpulsed level inferred for m28 can be used to discriminate which relation(s ) can better predict the collective contribution . using the best - fit parameters for these fundamental plane relations ( equations  1 - 4 and table  3 in hui",
    "et al . 2011 ) and the updated gc parameters ( harris 1996 ; 2010 version ) , the relations involve metallicity and optical / ir energy densities result in an estimate in a range of @xmath49  erg  s@xmath7 which is consistent with the observed off - pulse luminosity . on the other hand , the best - fit relations that involve the encounter rate result in an estimate of @xmath50  erg  s@xmath7 which apparently overshoot the observed value .    for further investigating this putative periodic signal , multi - wavelength observations are certainly required .",
    "in particular , the phase - aligned x - ray/@xmath4ray pulse profile will provide an important constraint for the high energy emission model .",
    "however , no existing x - ray timing data is available for m28a in _ fermi _ era . as the timing noise of m28a is quite strong in comparison with other msps and it possibly exhibited glitches , the phase - alignment of multi - wavelength light curves subjects to a lot of uncertainties .",
    "therefore , follow - up timing observations in other wavelengths are encouraged for further investigations .",
