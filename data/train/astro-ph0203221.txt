    "multiple observations of external galaxies starting with _",
    "einstein _ have shown convincingly that the x - ray emission of normal spirals similar to our own milky way is dominated by x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "an x - ray binary contains either a neutron star or a black hole ; it can be classified as low - mass ( lmxb ) or high - mass ( hmxb ) according to the spectral type of the companion star .",
    "it is well known that in our galaxy most hmxbs lie in the galactic plane , while the lmxbs have more spherical distribution with conspicuous concentration towards the galactic center . lmxbs and hmxbs",
    "demonstrate very similar x - ray spectra in some of their states , therefore difficult to discriminate them in a single spectral observation .",
    "recently grimm , gilfanov and sunyaev ( 2001 ) demonstrated the difference between x - ray luminosity distributions of lmxbs and hmxbs in the milky way , providing a method for discriminating the two populations in other galaxies .",
    "m31 ( the andromeda galaxy ) is of special importance for extragalactic astronomy because , at a distance of 760 kpc ( van der bergh 2000 ) , it is the closest spiral galaxy to our own .",
    "m31 is believed in many respects to be similar to the milky way . by observing m31 we can sample hundreds of x - ray sources at a nearly uniform distance and less obscured by interstellar gas and dust than those in the galaxy due to the favorable orientation of the m31 .",
    "it is therefore quite interesting to look at the luminosity distributions for various populations of x - ray sources in m31 and compare them with our galaxy .",
    "however , earlier attempts to find the difference between luminosity distributions of x - ray sources in the bulge and disk of m31 were unsuccessful ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this letter we report on the difference between the disk and bulge x - ray source populations of m31 , as observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ in the course of the most sensitive x - ray survey of a neighboring galaxy to date .",
    "in the following analysis we use data from three _ xmm - newton _ observations of the bulge and galactic disk of m31 ( see table [ obslog ] , fig . [ image_general]_a _ ) .",
    "the first observation of the central part of m31 ( m31 core ; @xmath0 ) was performed on june 25 , 2000 @xcite .",
    "two regions of the northern part of the galactic disk ( @xmath1 ) were observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ on january 5 @xcite ( m31 north1 field ) and january 26 , 2002 ( m31 north2 field ) as a part of the guaranteed time program ( pi : k.o .",
    "[ image_general ] ) .",
    "we use data from three european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instruments : two epic mos detectors ( @xcite ) and the epic pn detector ( @xcite ) . in all observations",
    "the epic instruments were operated in the _ full window mode _ ( @xmath2 diameter fov ) with the medium optical blocking filter .",
    "we reduced epic data with the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas v 5.2 ) .",
    "images in celestial coordinates with a pixel size of 2@xmath3 have been accumulated in the @xmath4 kev energy band from both mos and pn detectors .",
    "the resulting images for the epic - mos1 instrument are shown in figure [ image_general]_b , c , d_. sources were detected with a program based on the wavelet decomposition algorithm , set at @xmath5 detection threshold .",
    "we expect errors in the source position determination to be dominated by residual systematic errors of order @xmath6 .",
    "we detected 230 point x - ray sources above a @xmath7 level of significance .",
    "we cross - identified the detected x - ray objects with catalogs of globular cluster candidates and supernova remnants ( @xcite ) , based on a positional coincidence of @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ image_general]_b _ ) .",
    "four sources were identified with foreground objects and excluded from the analysis . due to source confusion in the central part of the galaxy sources located within the central @xmath9",
    "were also excluded .    to estimate energy fluxes and spectra , we used an extraction radius of @xmath10 ( depending on the distance of the source from the telescope axis ) and subtracted as background the spectrum of adjacent source - free regions .",
    "we corrected the count rates for the vignetting of the xmm telescope , based on the current calibration files provided with sas .",
    "the epic count rates were converted into energy fluxes using analytical fits to the spectra of brighter sources .",
    "detailed spectral analysis for individual sources will be presented elsewhere . for faint sources we estimated energy fluxes with web - pimms assuming an absorbed simple power law spectral shape with photon index @xmath11 and an equivalent absorbing column of @xmath12 @xmath13 ( galactic value for the direction to m31 ) .",
    "altogether we detected 230 x - ray sources in the three fields of m31 : 118 sources in the core and 112 in the north1 and north2 fields .",
    "these include unidentified background and foreground sources , as discussed below .",
    "the properties of the individual sources are presented elsewhere ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we discuss the source populations and their luminosity distributions .",
    "we have noticed that the brightest x - ray sources are concentrated towards the center of m31 , while the fainter ones are distributed much more uniformly ( fig .",
    "1_c , d _ ) .",
    "furthermore , we have mentioned that all remaining bright sources in north1 and north2 fields can be identified with globular clusters ( fig.1_b _ ) .",
    "our data prove , for the first time , that m31 resembles our galaxy in the distribution of its x - ray source populations ( i.e. lmxbs and hmxb ) ( see fig.1 in ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "we have built differential and cumulative luminosity distributions of the detected x - ray sources for the central part of m31 , and the combined north1 and north2 fields assuming a distance of 760 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ lum_distr ] ) . in order to minimize the contribution from non - disk x - ray population ,",
    "the sources identified with globular clusters were excluded from the north1/north2 sample . taking into account the sensitivity as a function of off - axis distance , the different exposure times , and the effect of diffuse x - ray emission ( in the m31 core field ) , we estimate a flux completeness limit of our sample as @xmath14 ergs s@xmath15 ( indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ lum_distr]_b _ ) .",
    "some of the objects in the m31 fields must be background and foreground sources lying outside m31 ( i.e. background agn , and galactic k and m stars ) .",
    "based on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ deep field results @xcite , one might expect to detect @xmath16 background agn in each field with an apparent luminosity around @xmath17 ergs s@xmath15",
    ". the total number of unidentified foreground galactic stars could be @xmath18 sources per field @xcite .",
    "correction for such background / foreground objects would flatten the faint end of the cumulative luminosity distribution ( below @xmath19 ergs s@xmath15 ) , but would not significantly modify the higher luminosity part of the distribution .    as it is clearly seen from both panels of fig .",
    "[ lum_distr ] , the population of the northern disk regions of m31 is dominated by relatively faint objects with luminosities below @xmath20 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "the overall shape of the cumulative luminosity distribution ( fig .",
    "[ lum_distr]_b _ ) can be presented with a simple power law function with an index of @xmath21 for luminosities above @xmath14 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "there is some indication for a flattening of the distribution at lower luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ lum_distr]_b _ ) , which can be attributed to the incompleteness of our sample at the faint end .",
    "in contrast to the northern disk regions , bright x - ray sources contribute significantly to the population in the central region of m31 ( fig .",
    "[ lum_distr]_a _ ) .",
    "the shape of both cumulative and differential luminosity distributions for the central region of m31 ( _ blue histograms _ in fig .",
    "[ lum_distr ] ) indicate the presence of a brake at around @xmath22 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "we fit the unbinned cumulative distribution with a broken power law ( fig .",
    "[ lum_distr]_b _ ) .",
    "for source luminosities between @xmath17 and @xmath23 ergs s@xmath15 , we obtain a power law index of @xmath24 , while for the higher luminosities the power law index is @xmath25 .",
    "there is again some flattening of the cumulative distribution towards the faint source end ( fig .",
    "[ lum_distr]_b _ ) , probably caused by the incompleteness of our sample .",
    "these results for the m31 core field are in general agreement with previous studies of the central part of m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the luminosity distributions began as soon as individual x - ray sources in nearby galaxies were resolved ( see fabbiano 1995 for a review of early results )",
    ". more sensitive surveys with _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ significantly increased the number of sources detected ( see read , ponman & strickland ( 1997 ) for _ rosat _ and fabbiano ( 2001 ) for _ chandra _ review ) .",
    "most previous studies , however , differ from our present work in two important aspects : ( i ) for most external galaxies , sensitivity limits were above or around 10@xmath26 erg / s , while in our case we are able to study in detail population of sources between 5@xmath2710@xmath28 and 10@xmath26 erg / s ; ( ii ) previous studies of luminosity distributions in m31 ( @xcite ) were restricted to the central @xmath29 . since the inner region of m31 ( @xmath30 ) is dominated by the bulge and spheroid populations , the disk population was not well sampled in previous surveys .",
    "our results , however , can be directly compared to the luminosity distributions for galactic sources obtained by grimm et al .",
    "the comparison shows that the luminosity function which we obtain for the core region is close to the luminosity function of lmxbs in our galaxy : both distributions have a characteristic `` knee '' at a few@xmath31 ergs s@xmath15 and can be described by a broken power law or a cut - off power law models .",
    "the luminosity distribution for the two northern fields of m31 resembles the luminosity function for galactic hmxbs : both have a power law - like form with a slope steeper than that of the corresponding m31 bulge / galactic lmxb luminosity distributions ; the m31 disk / galactic hmxb distributions terminate at much lower luminosities ( @xmath20 ergs s@xmath15 ) than m31 bulge / galactic lmxb luminosity distributions ( @xmath32 ergs s@xmath15 ) .",
    "we conclude therefore that the population of fainter x - ray sources we found in disk of m31 is probably dominated by the hmxbs , while the bulge region inside 15@xmath33 is dominated by lmxbs by analogy with the milky way .",
    "our results confirm that , as in milky way and other nearby galaxies , the younger population of hmxbs in m31 is typically less luminous than the older populations of lmxbs and globular clusters ( see also helfand & moran 2001 for a discussion of hmxb luminosities ) . in our study we see no evidence that the brightest sources in m31 are associated with young populations ; in fact , we see the opposite effect .",
    "this is in contrast to soria @xmath34 wu ( 2002 ) , who invoke a population of bright young binaries to explain a large number of high luminosity objects observed in the starburst galaxies .",
    "that effect can be probably attributed to the differences in the galaxy type and ranges of x - ray luminosities under study .",
    "we analyzed _ xmm - newton _",
    "data for the three m31 fields and detected a total of 230 point - like sources .",
    "we built luminosity distributions separately for the bulge ( inner 15@xmath33 ) and disk regions .",
    "a striking difference between the bulge and disk populations has been demonstrated for the first time .",
    "we report on the discovery of lower luminosity population in the disk of m31 .",
    "comparison of our results with the luminosity function obtained by grimm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the milky way allows us to conclude that lower - luminosity population in the disk is probably dominated by hmxbs , and that the luminosity distributions of x - ray sources in the bulge and disk of m31 are similar to the corresponding parts of our galaxy .",
    "we have used data obtained with _ xmm - newton _ satellite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ is an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "we are grateful to the personnel of the _ xmm - newton _ science operations centre at vilspa , spain for satellite operations and expedited data preparation for scientific analysis .",
    "we are thankful to our colleagues from pv data analysis team for a fruitful collaboration in earlier analysis of m31 pv observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are especially indebted to m.watson , pi of m31 pv program .",
