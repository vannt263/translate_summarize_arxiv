    "the performance of future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments to unravel leptonic cp violation ( cpv ) and the neutrino mass hierarchy ( mh ) is crucially dependent on the achievable event rates and hence strongly on the size of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "recent t2k",
    "@xcite and minos  @xcite data have provided new information on @xmath0 , indicating that 0.01 @xmath4 0.1 at @xmath5 confidence level with a best - fit value of 0.051 ( 0.063 ) for normal ( inverted ) mass ordering  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that in the next few years , this hint will be validated with high significance with more informations coming from the t2k , minos and upcoming reactor and no@xmath6a experiments , opening up the possibility of observing cpv in the lepton sector if the dirac cp phase , @xmath7 , is not equal to @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the prospects of the present generation long baseline experiments , t2k and no@xmath6a in probing cpv and the mass ordering are very limited even if @xmath0 is large  @xcite .",
    "the experiment class , which can ultimately address these unsolved issues with unprecedented sensitivity for both small and large @xmath0 , is the neutrino factory  @xcite . in a neutrino factory ,",
    "the neutrino beam is created from the decay of muons in flight in the straight sections of a storage ring .",
    "the international neutrino factory and superbeam scoping study  @xcite has laid the foundations for the currently ongoing design study for the neutrino factory ( ids - nf )  @xcite which has come up with a first - version baseline setup of a high energy neutrino factory ( henf ) with @xmath10 and two baselines @xmath11 and @xmath12 served by two racetrack - shaped storage rings  @xcite .",
    "the most promising avenue to explore cpv and @xmath13 at a neutrino factory is the sub - dominant @xmath14 oscillation channel which produces muons of the opposite charge ( wrong - sign muons ) to those stored in the storage ring and these can be detected with the help of the charge identification capability of a magnetized iron neutrino detector ( mind )  @xcite . as the design of the neutrino factory matures ,",
    "more realistic detector simulation and analysis technique have been developed which improves the efficiency of mind at low energies and also lowers the threshold  @xcite .",
    "these new simulations provide the full response matrices for all the signal and background channels . in the most recent analysis  @xcite ,",
    "low energy neutrino signal events down to @xmath15 were selected with an efficiency plateau of @xmath1660% for @xmath17 and @xmath1680% for @xmath18 events starting at @xmath16@xmath19 , while maintaining the background level at or below 10@xmath20 .",
    "for the neutral current background , the impact of migration is non - negligible and it is peaked at lower energies .",
    "this feed - down is the strongest effect of migration and thus has potential impact on the energy optimization , since it penalizes neutrino flux at high energies , where there is little oscillation but a large increase in fed - down background .",
    "now we discuss the simultaneous optimization of baseline and muon energy in a green - field neutrino factory scenario  @xcite using the new migration matrices for mind detector  @xcite .",
    "( true ) for which cpv will be discovered at @xmath1 c.l . as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the single baseline neutrino factory .",
    "the different panels correspond to different true values of @xmath23 , as given there . here",
    "we consider @xmath24 useful muon decays in total with a 50 kt detector .",
    "the optimal performance is marked by a dot : ( 2200,10.00 ) , ( 2288,13.62 ) , ( 3390,20.00 ) and ( 4345,22.08 ) with regard to their best reaches of the fraction of @xmath7(true ) at : 0.77 , 0.84 , 0.67 and 0.42.,width=491,height=377 ]    [ fig : lvse ]    here we are interested to optimize @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the single baseline neutrino factory to have cpv discovery at @xmath1 c.l . for different fractions of true values of @xmath7 assuming that the true value of @xmath23 is known .",
    "the different panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lvse ] depict the same for four different true values of @xmath23 .",
    "as expected , this figure clearly shows that the optimization strongly depends on the true value of @xmath23 chosen . in case of large @xmath25 ,",
    "shorter baselines and lower energies are preferred .",
    "even @xmath22 as low as 5 to @xmath26 at the fermilab - homestake baseline of about @xmath27 is quite close to the optimal choice , which means that the mind detector approaches the magnetized totally active scintillator detector performance of the low energy neutrino factory ( lenf )  @xcite .",
    "note that compared to earlier analyses without feed - down effect due to background migration , now too high @xmath22 are in fact disfavored in the large @xmath23 case .",
    "for the other extreme , @xmath28 , baselines between @xmath29 and @xmath30  km are preferred with @xmath31  gev , which corresponds more to the choice of @xmath32 for henf , such as the ids - nf baseline . including the other two panels",
    ", the optimal region within each panel moves from the lower left on the plots to the upper right as the true value of @xmath23 decreases .",
    "this means that , depending on the choice of true @xmath23 , the optimization results in the lenf , the henf , or an intermediate scenario , and that the low and high energy neutrino factories are just two versions of the same experiment optimized for different parts of the parameter space .",
    "note that , all the figures presented in this talk have been taken from  @xcite and all the simulations have been performed using the globes software  @xcite .",
    "confidence level is possible as a function of true @xmath23 . from left to right for cpv , mh and @xmath0 .",
    "here we compare the performances of a single baseline lenf with @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 , and a 50 kt mind detector , and a two baseline henf with @xmath35  gev and a 50 kt mind detector at each baseline , and @xmath36 , and @xmath37.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    [ fig : lenf ]    in this talk , we have discussed the optimization of the neutrino factory based on the most up - to - date analysis of the mind detector using response matrices for all the signal and background channels . the lower threshold and",
    "higher efficiencies compared to earlier simulations indicate that the mind detector characteristics are getting more similar to the characteristics of the detectors proposed for the lenf ( e.g. , a magnetized tasd ) . for large @xmath23 ,",
    "a single baseline neutrino factory with @xmath22 as low as 5 to 8  gev and a baseline as short as fermilab to homestake ( about @xmath27 ) might be sufficient . in the case of small @xmath38 , however , a two baseline neutrino factory with one baseline between about 2500  km and 5000  km , the other one at about the magic baseline 7500",
    "km is ideal .",
    "the additional information coming from the second baseline which is at the magic distance ( insensitive to @xmath7 ) helps to remove the degeneracies and it enhances the fraction of @xmath7 for which cpv discovery is possible .",
    "[ fig : lenf ] nicely depicts this message where we compare the performance of the optimal single baseline lenf with the optimal two baseline henf for the same mind detector .",
    "it is quite evident from this figure that for @xmath39 the low energy version can perform all of the required measurements , whereas for smaller values the henf is clearly better .",
    "it suggests that this different optimization would be sufficient to compensate for the relative deterioration of performance at large @xmath23 observed in the traditional henf .",
    "we conclude that the features of the new detector simulation that the backgrounds are typically reconstructed at lower energies and that the threshold is lower have significant impact on the optimization of @xmath22 .",
    "the recent simulation results for the mind have reduced the performance margin between tasd and mind considerably .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the low- and high - energy neutrino factory should not be regarded as separate options and they merely correspond to two extreme corners of a common parameter space .",
