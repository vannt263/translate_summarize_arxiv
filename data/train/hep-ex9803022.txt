    "motivated by the successful cleo ii search for @xmath37 decays@xcite , we have looked for analogous decays in the charm sector . in this paper",
    "we consider decays of the pseudo - scalar @xmath0 meson to final states consisting of a vector meson ( @xmath38,@xmath39,@xmath40or @xmath41 ) plus a photon .",
    "unlike @xmath37 decays , the short - range amplitudes relevant to @xmath42 are expected to be overwhelmed by much larger long - range electro - magnetic effects .",
    "the dominant diagrams describing these electro - magnetic amplitudes are shown in figure  [ fig : fyn ] . in each case , a pair of vector mesons is produced .",
    "providing the quantum numbers are correct , one of these can couple to a photon .",
    "the phenomenology of such interactions , called `` vector meson dominance '' ( vmd ) , has been well studied @xcite .",
    "using vmd , one can make rough estimates of the expected rates for the modes studied in this paper . if the coupling of the photon to the transverse component of a @xmath43 results in a vector conversion with about 1% probability , we can use the particle data group  @xcite value for the @xmath44 branching ratio , @xmath45 , and expect that br(@xmath46 ) is about @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fraction of @xmath41 s produced in the decay of the @xmath0 which are transversely polarized .",
    "detailed calculations of the long - range , @xmath49-exchange and other contributing processes have been published by several groups @xcite .",
    "the predictions range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 and are listed in table  [ tbl : yield ] .    in the @xmath52 sector ,",
    "observation of the decay @xmath53 at the measured rate provided compelling evidence for the existence of a `` penguin '' contribution to the @xmath54 mesons decay amplitude into this channel .",
    "the analogous short range penguin diagrams for the radiative decay of @xmath0 mesons are expected to contribute at the level of @xcite , making them relatively unimportant .",
    "the long range electro - magnetic contributions that are expected to dominate @xmath55 decay amplitudes also contribute in the @xmath52 sector .",
    "their contribution to @xmath53 , for example , may be as big as 20%@xcite .",
    "it is hoped that a study of these effects in the charm sector can improve our understanding of their relevance to bottom decay .",
    "the cleo collaboration has recently published a complimentary analysis searching for flavor changing neutral currents in @xmath56 decays@xcite .",
    "the data used for the analysis described in this paper were acquired with the cleo ii detector @xcite at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) , and represents a total integrated luminosity of @xmath57 .",
    "when searching for @xmath55 decays we apply several selection criteria on both the photon and vector meson candidates before attempting to reconstruct the @xmath0@xcite .",
    "we look for @xmath58 and require .",
    "we also demand that the time of flight and specific ionization of both @xmath38 daughter tracks be consistent with kaon hypotheses .",
    "we require @xmath39 candidates to decay into @xmath59 and have @xmath60 . both photons from the @xmath61",
    "are required to be in the central region of the detector , @xmath62 , and the @xmath63 invariant mass must be consistent with a @xmath61 with @xmath64 . to improve the measurement of the @xmath61 4-vector , the photons are kinematically fit to the known @xmath61 mass .",
    "we look for @xmath65 and require . in this mode",
    "we also make a cut on the decay angle of the daughter particles in the @xmath40 rest frame , requiring , since signal events should follow a @xmath66 distribution due to angular momentum conservation . finally , we reconstruct @xmath41 s through the decay @xmath67 and require @xmath68 .    in all cases",
    "we require that the `` radiative '' photon be in the central region of the calorimeter , have an energy greater than 830 mev , and have a calorimeter shower isolated from charged tracks in the event . to avoid background from @xmath61",
    "decays we veto photons that are part of a @xmath61 candidate with @xmath69 .    in this analysis",
    ", all @xmath0 candidates are required to come from a @xmath70 decay . the additional kinematic constraint provided by the @xmath71",
    "is used to significantly reduce the otherwise large combinatoric background .",
    "we require the reconstructed mass difference between the @xmath72 and the @xmath0 , , to be between 144.3 mev/@xmath73 and 146.5 mev/@xmath73 . to further reduce the background , we demand that @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is defined to be the momentum of the candidate @xmath71 divided by the maximum possible @xmath71 momentum .",
    "the specific values of the cuts discussed above were chosen after a systematic study of @xmath76 for each of the modes , using large samples of geant@xcite based monte - carlo data to model each specific signal as well as the background .",
    "to learn about possible sources of background for each of the four decay modes , a large sample of monte - carlo generated @xmath77 events was analyzed .",
    "the predominant background source found was real @xmath78 decays where the @xmath0 decayed in channels involving @xmath61 s , which in turn decayed such that one of the photons had very little energy and went undetected .",
    "since the @xmath71 decay in the above sequence is real , backgrounds of this kind will result in a false signal that peaks in the mass difference @xmath79 distribution .",
    "additional peaking in the @xmath0 mass spectrum will depend on kinematics .",
    "this type of background is most severe for the @xmath80 analysis because poorly reconstructed @xmath81 decays , where one of the @xmath61 s photons is missed , will peak in the @xmath0 signal region .",
    "figure  [ fig : kstback ] shows the @xmath0 mass distribution for a set of @xmath82 events analyzed as @xmath83 .    in the case of @xmath84",
    "the problem is less severe since there is no background decay mode which peaks in the signal region of our invariant mass distribution , although misreconstructed @xmath82 events cause the upward distortion of the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum just below the expected @xmath0 mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhoback ] shows the distribution of these events when analyzed as @xmath84 .",
    "for the modes @xmath85 and @xmath86 there are no @xmath0 decay modes with large enough branching ratios to cause noticeable peaking in the reconstructed invariant mass distribution , hence we expect the background in the @xmath0 mass spectra of these to be smooth .",
    "all yields were obtained by fitting the @xmath0 mass spectra .",
    "the signal in all cases was parameterized by a double bifurcated gaussian whose mean and width were determined using monte - carlo .",
    "the background shape used depended on the mode . in the cases of @xmath46 and @xmath87",
    "the background is expected to be smooth and likelihood fits were done using simple linear background . the data and fits for these modes are shown in figures  [ fig : phidat ] and  [ fig : omgdat ] .    in the cases of @xmath84 and @xmath80 ,",
    "we know the background shape is significantly modified by misreconstructed @xmath88 decays .",
    "using monte - carlo , we determined the magnitude and shape of this contribution to the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum , and in both cases included an additional component in our fits to compensate .",
    "the absolute normalization of this additional component was determined from a previous analysis of @xmath88 decays@xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : rhodat ] and  [ fig : kstdat](b ) show the mass spectra and fits for these modes after subtracting the contribution from misreconstructed @xmath88 .    the results are summarized in table  [ tbl : yield ] .",
    "the efficiency for each mode was determined by analyzing samples of geant@xcite based monte - carlo `` signal '' events , and is also presented in table  [ tbl : yield ] . to obtain branching ratios from the efficiency corrected yields we performed a parallel analysis looking for @xmath78 , @xmath89 decays .",
    "our yield in this mode was @xmath90 events with an overall analysis efficiency of ( @xmath91 ) % , determined using monte - carlo . using the pdg value of ( @xmath92 ) % for the @xmath89 branching ratio we find the initial number of @xmath78 decays in our data sample was @xmath93 .",
    "several sources of possible systematic error were investigated , and the results are presented in table  [ tbl : sys ] . with the exception of @xmath87 , the uncertainty in each case",
    "is dominated by uncertainties in fitting . to investigate this error we systematically changed either the combinatorial background shape , the normalization of the @xmath88 background component ( in the @xmath94 and @xmath95 cases only ) , the signal shape , and the number of bins used in the fits .",
    "constant , linear and quadratic background functions were tried .",
    "signal shapes were parameterized by gaussian , double gaussian , bifurcated gaussian and the double bifurcated gaussian shapes . in each case",
    "we took the largest variation as our estimate of the systematic error .",
    "as an additional check we excluded the signal region and fit only the background , using simple event counting in the signal region combined with poisson statistics to obtain the upper limits .",
    "the result of this procedure for @xmath80 , the mode having the otherwise biggest fitting uncertainties , is shown in figure  [ fig : kstdat](a ) . in this case we fitted the @xmath80 data with a linear combinatorial component plus the absolutely normalized monte - carlo predicted @xmath88 background , excluding the region between @xmath96 and @xmath97 from the fit .",
    "we then count data and predicted background events in the same region to obtain a net yield of @xmath98 . using a conservative yield of @xmath99 events results in a 90% cl upper limit yield of 39 events , consistent with the original fitted result .",
    "the vector meson mass cuts were studied by varying them to produce a 10% change in efficiency and reanalyzing both data and monte - carlo with the new values to estimate the systematic error .    to estimate the errors associated with analysis requirements common to all of the studied modes ( the @xmath100 mass difference and @xmath71 scaled momentum ) while avoiding the problem of low statistics in the modes of interest , we used numbers obtained in a previous measurement of @xmath101 @xcite .    from a cleo study of the decays @xmath102 and @xmath103 ,",
    "we assign a 5.5% systematic error for uncertainty in the overall @xmath61 finding efficiency and a 2.5% uncertainty for each individual photon .",
    "the systematic error due to particle identification was estimated by removing that cut entirely and noting the change .",
    "the systematic errors on the yield and the efficiency were treated separately when calculating the final upper limits .",
    "the efficiency and normalization errors were combined in quadrature and the efficiency was reduced by the resulting factor .",
    "the fitting systematic errors were used to increase the 90% cl upper limit yields .",
    "using data representing @xmath104 of integrated luminosity acquired by the cleo ii detector at the cornell electron storage ring , we have conducted a search for radiative decay modes of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the final results for the 90% confidence level upper limit branching ratios for the modes studied are : @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108    we note that all of these values are well above the theoretical expectations as shown in table  [ tbl : yield ] .",
    "we hope that with more data from cesr , kek and pep - ii b - factories it will be possible to provide improved measurements in the future .",
