    "the idea of spontaneous birth of the universe by quantum tunneling from a de sitter instanton has been coupled by vilenkin @xcite to the beginning of the inflationary expansion in a de sitter spacetime with space sections of positive curvature .",
    "we propose an extension of this process , through topology change and inflation , to arrive at a friedmann model with closed hyperbolic spaces ( chs ) as spatial sections .",
    "we are motivated by previous work by gott@xcite and bucher et al .",
    "@xcite in the matter of inflation leading to an @xmath0@xmath1 universe , but assume a mechanism different from theirs , relying on de lorenci et al.s @xcite formalism to quantify the probability of changes in cosmic global topology .",
    "there have been suspicions of incompatibility of chs universes with maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite ; we refer to a recent paper by cornish et al .",
    "@xcite to answer to this criticism .",
    "we use planck units @xmath2    de sitter instanton has the metric ( cf .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , with @xmath5 imaginary time , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are spherical coordinates , and @xmath8 is a constant of the order of planck s length or time .",
    "but instead of being defined on a four - sphere @xmath9 , our gravitational instanton has a more general topology : note that ( i ) the @xmath10 instanton is obtained by analytic continuation into imaginary time of de sitter spacetime with topology @xmath11 , where the real line @xmath12 is the time axis and the three - sphere @xmath13 is the spatial section @xcite ; ( ii ) de sitter s metric of positive spatial curvature can be assigned to any topology of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the quotient space of @xmath13 by a discrete group of isometries @xmath16 which acts on @xmath13 without fixed points - see , for example , ellis @xcite , or lachize - rey and luminet @xcite ; and ( iii ) the same process of analytic continuation into imaginary time can be done on these new spacetime topologies .",
    "so we assume as a generalization of de sitter s instanton the metric of eq .",
    "[ metricinstanton ] defined on the quotient spaces @xmath17 ( which may not be manifolds but rather orbifolds - see @xcite ,  2 ) .",
    "the volume of @xmath18 with its curvature normalized to unity , is @xmath19order of @xmath20 its fundamental group @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath16 hence , except for the case @xmath22 ( trivial @xmath23 is multiply connected .    when this instanton becomes a real de sitter spacetime , we get the inflationary metric of positive spatial curvature ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , starting at @xmath24 @xmath25 and the topology of the direct product @xmath14 , as implied above .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is related in @xcite to a constant energy density , which is now interpreted as the initial value of the inflaton potential @xmath27 . as in @xcite , during this epoch the inflaton field @xmath28 is stuck in a false vacuum ( region @xmath29 in fig .",
    "1 ) , causing a growth that erases inhomogeneities in @xmath30 . but in our case this stage is very short . in the numerical example of next section ,",
    "@xmath31 is the endtime of this epoch , which therefore may hardly be called inflationary ; see below .",
    "at @xmath32 we assume that a topology and metric transition takes place ; the latter becomes    @xmath33    with initial @xmath34 to be determined below .",
    "this is similar to the metric change in @xcite , but here we shall assume it to happen as a quantum transition in minisuperspace .",
    "the change in metric in a closed space implies a change in topology , since the spherical space @xmath35 can not support the hyperbolic metric in the spatial part of eq .",
    "[ desitterhyp ]  cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 5.2 .",
    "this metric and topology change is signaled by the small bump in the potential @xmath36 ",
    "region @xmath37 in fig . 1 ;",
    "we hope a mechanism for this process can be adapted from the one recently developed by de lorenci et al .",
    "@xcite , who estimated the probabilities of a few similar transitions .",
    "their results , interpreted with some liberty , indicate that a spherical cosmology is unstable against quantum transitions , and has a good chance of becoming hyperbolic , as in our case .    here",
    "the spatial section becomes the chs @xmath38 where @xmath39 is hyperbolic three - space , and @xmath40 is a discrete group of isometries acting on @xmath39 without fixed points  cf .",
    "spacetime topology becomes @xmath41 since this is a quantum process , we need not demand continuity in the five - dimensional pseudoeuclidean space where de sitter spacetime is imbedded , as done in @xcite .",
    "but , as a working hypothesis , we postulate that energy , hence physical volume , is conserved in the transition , and we expect the change in the expansion factor to be small ; therefore the normalized volumes of @xmath30 and @xmath42 should be of the same order of magnitude",
    ". this can be arranged , and @xmath43 calculated , as will be seen in the next section .    when space becomes @xmath42 it may again have density irregularites . ( to see this , imagine a uniform distribution of a thin film of matter over a two - sphere , which suddenly gets a handle and becomes a torus ; the film takes a time to spread itself evenly over the new surface . ) in the light of this , it is not so essential that the previous stage gets homogenized , as it is that its duration be short so that @xmath30 will not grow too much and @xmath44 may become smooth ; see next section . at this point",
    "one might wonder why is stage @xmath30 necessary at all . perhaps because there is no gravitational instanton @xcite that would actualize directly as a closed hyperbolic universe .",
    "thus @xmath42 is neither equivalent to the nucleated bubble in @xcite or @xcite , nor to the smooth patch in kolb and turner s @xcite basic picture of inflation , for either of these is already homogeneous as it appears on the scene . besides",
    ", @xmath42 need not grow to encompass the observable universe ; when it does not , as in the example below , the model predicts observable effects of the nontrivial topology .",
    "the most obvious of these , but still difficult to verify , is the production of multiple images of each source , so as to mimic the uniform distribution of an open friedmann model .",
    "see @xcite;@xcite and references therein .    in @xcite this is the time of slow roll inflation , with @xmath36 sloping as @xmath45 towards the true vacuum . for simplicity here we prefer the potential in @xcite , which has a plateau ( region @xmath46 in fig .",
    "1 ) of about the same height as in the false vacuum , so that inflation proceeds at the same rate as before .",
    "this epoch is @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being determined by a continuity condition with the next phase .",
    "finally @xcite a phase transition is arranged , the equation of state going from @xmath49 to @xmath50 which ends the inflationary period .",
    "there is reheating around the true vacuum ( @xmath51 in fig .",
    "1 ) , and spacetime gets the usual friedmann metric of negative spatial curvature    @xmath52    thus we reach the epoch of standard cosmology , except for the effects of the compactness and multiple connectedness of the spatial sections  see @xcite .",
    "a convenient family of candidates for @xmath53 are the lens spaces @xmath54 where @xmath55 are coprime integers with @xmath56 @xcite . their fundamental group , hence also @xmath16 is of order @xmath57 , so their volume is @xmath58 hyperbolic manifolds @xmath42 are known to exist with normalized volumes from @xmath59 up @xcite .    as an example , let us take @xmath60 with normalized volume @xmath61 , and as @xmath42 the smallest known chs , weeks - matveev - fomenko manifold ( cf .",

    "the horizon s radius is @xmath71.$ ] we can have @xmath72 only if @xmath73 or @xmath74 with @xmath75 as obtained above , we must have @xmath76 this value is compatible with the one we now obtain from the continuity of the expansion factor , @xmath77 in the beginning of the friedmann radiation era that follows reheating , @xmath78 ( cf .",

    "the continuity condition gives @xmath90 close to the value @xmath91 in @xcite .",
    "today s physical volume of @xmath42 would be @xmath92 @xmath93 , while the observable universe  interpreted as the region of repeated cosmic images  is about 200 times larger .",
    "in the above reasoning the dynamics of spontaneous birth and inflation processes in the modified scenario was presumed to be adaptable from previous results .",
    "we plan to elaborate on this point , as also on the matter of topology changes , and to present a more detailed picture in the future .",
    "thermodynamics considerations , prevalent in @xcite and not touched upon here , may also be addressed in the wider study .",
    "the question of the influence of space closure on the generation and growth of primordial fluctuations has been left out , to be examined elsewhere .",
    "here we only comment on doubts that have appeared on whether a closed hyperbolic universe would be compatible with the long wavelength modes of the cmb ",
    "see @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , in hyperbolic universes",
    "there is no low cutoff for these modes .",
    "the confusion seems to arise from mistaking the separations between equivalent points in the space of images @xmath39 with maximal wavelengths of perturbations ; but the latter can be spread over closed geodesics , which may form knotted patterns of increasing length inside the chs .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore these models are probably compatible with the spotted maps of the cmb obtained by nasa s cobe satellite , but of course more research is needed in this direction .",
