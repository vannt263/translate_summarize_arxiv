    "the wealth of recent precision measurements in cosmology @xcite places stringent constraints on any model of the universe .",
    "typically , such a model is given in terms of a number of cosmological parameters .",
    "numerical tools , such as cmbfast @xcite , camb @xcite and @xcite , permit to calculate the prediction of a given model for the observational data . while these tools are comparatively fast ,",
    "scanning the parameter space for the most likely model and confidence regions can become a matter of time and computing power .    the cost of evaluating models on a n - dimensional grid in parameter space increases exponentially with the number of parameters .",
    "in contrast , the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method scales roughly linearly with the number of parameters @xcite .",
    "the mcmc method has already been used to constrain various models @xcite .",
    "a popular tool for setting up mcmc simulations is the cosmo - mc package @xcite for the camb code , an improved proposal distribution for the local metropolis algorithm has been proposed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the analyzethis package for cmbeasy .",
    "it includes a parallel mcmc driver , as well as routines to calculate the likelihood of a model with respect to various data sets .",
    "we took special care in designing a step - proposal strategy that leads to fast convergence and mixing of the chains .",
    "this strategy is applied during the early stages of the simulation .",
    "as soon as the likelihood contour has been roughly explored , the adaptive step proposal freezes in .",
    "this ensures that the mcmc results are not contaminated by the adaptive steps . at the same time",
    ", the automated step optimization considerably improves performance and is rather convenient .",
    "the raw data files can be processed from within a graphical user interface ( gui ) . using the gui",
    ", one can marginalize , visualize and print one and two dimensional likelihood surfaces ( see figure [ fig::gui ] ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : we describe the mcmc method and our implementation in section [ sec::simulation ] . a brief introduction to the software",
    "is given in section [ sec::user ] .",
    "we analyze the constraints on cosmological parameters from observational data sets in section [ sec::constraints ] . in section [ sec::conclusion ]",
    "we present our conclusions , while the format of the mcmc data files is defined in [ appendix::format ] .",

    "shown is the marginalized likelihood in the @xmath1 plane of a @xmath0cdm model . ]    in the following , we will review the basic ideas of markov chain monte carlo simulation @xcite and describe our implementation .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 denotes a vector of all model parameters , @xmath3 represents some observed data and @xmath4 is the likelihood of observing @xmath3 given parameters @xmath2 .",
    "specifying a prior distribution @xmath5 for the parameters , bayes theorem yields the posterior distribution @xmath6 of @xmath2 given the observed data @xmath3 : @xmath7 using @xmath6 , one can compute expectation values @xmath8=",
    "\\frac{\\int f(\\theta ) { \\pi(\\theta|x)}d\\theta}{\\int { \\pi(\\theta|x)}d\\theta},\\ ] ] as well as confidence levels .",
    "the idea of the mcmc method is to directly draw samples from the posterior @xmath6 .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath6 may then be estimated using this sample . from the sample of parameter values @xmath9 ( the ergodic average ) : @xmath10=\\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{j=1}^{n } \\theta_j^{(i)}.\\ ] ] ] to accomplish the sampling of @xmath6 one uses a markov chain , which is a stochastic process @xmath11 where @xmath12 only depends on @xmath13 .",
    "the idea is to choose the next point in the chain based on the previous point such that @xmath6 becomes the stationary distribution of the chain @xmath14 there are several methods to accomplish this .",
    "we will concentrate on the metropolis algorithm @xcite and its implementation in cmbeasy .",
    "the algorithm is defined as follows ( for an illustration see fig .",
    "[ fig::randwalk ] ) :    1",
    ".   choose starting parameter vector @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   compute the likelihood @xmath16 of observing the experimental data given the parameters @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   obtain a new parameter vector by sampling from a `` proposal distribution '' @xmath17 ( see section [ sec::adaptive ] ) .",
    "[ choose_point ] 4 .",
    "compute the likelihood @xmath18 .",
    "5 .   if @xmath19 then save @xmath20 as new point in the chain ( `` take the step '' ) and go to ( [ choose_point ] ) .",
    "[ take_step ] 6 .   if @xmath21 then generate a random variable @xmath22 from @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath24 take the step as in ( [ take_step ] ) .",
    "if @xmath25 then reject @xmath20 , save @xmath26 as new point in the chain and go to ( [ choose_point ] ) .",
    "this algorithm assumes flat priors @xmath5 and a symmetric proposal distribution @xmath27 .",
    "note that we assign likelihood zero to any parameter set that has at least one point outside its prior .",
    "in this version of the metropolis algorithm , all parameters change with every step , a strategy called global metropolis .      at the beginning",
    ", the chain migrates from its random starting point to regions of higher likelihood .",
    "points during this `` burn - in '' do not constitute a sample from @xmath6 and should be eliminated . in principle , it may be difficult to tell from a single chain if it has converged towards the underlying @xmath6 . in mcmc ,",
    "one therefore uses several chains with random starting points and monitors mixing and convergence .    the convergence test of gelman and rubin @xcite monitors the variance of a parameter between the chains . to be precise ,",
    "consider using the last @xmath28 points of each of @xmath29 chains for the test .",
    "let @xmath30 label one entry of the parameter vector @xmath2 at point @xmath31 in chain @xmath32 with @xmath33 the mean for chain @xmath32 and @xmath34 the mean of all chains .",
    "the variance between chains @xmath35 and the within - chain variance @xmath36 are then given by @xmath37 and the quantity @xmath38 should converge to one .. ] a value of @xmath39 for all parameters indicates that the chain is sampling from @xmath6 . from this point",
    "onwards one may use the chain points for parameter estimates .",
    "when do we have enough points for parameter estimation ?",
    "this question is not easy to answer , since it is depends on the model , the used data sets and the desired accuracy how many chain points are needed for a robust estimate of parameters .",
    "therefore , in our implementation the mcmc simulation runs indefinetly .",
    "however , any `` breaking - criterion '' may be implemented easily , and the chains may be monitored with external programs during the run .",
    "the number of steps needed for good convergence and mixing depends strongly on the step proposal distribution .",
    "if the proposed steps are too large , the algorithm will frequently reject steps , giving slow convergence of the chain .",
    "if , on the other hand , the proposed steps are too small , it will take a long time for the chain to explore the likelihood surface , resulting in slow mixing . in the ideal case",
    "the proposal distribution should be as close to the posterior distribution @xmath6 as possible  which unfortunately is not known a priori . while a simple gaussian proposal distribution with step sizes @xmath40 is sufficient , it is not optimal in terms of computing costs if cosmological parameters are degenerate .",
    "a naive gaussian sampler would move slowly along the degeneracy direction , unaware of any degeneracy ( see figure [ fig::likelihood ] ) .     and @xmath41 , leading to slow mixing . ]    instead of using a naive gaussian proposal distribution , we sample from a multivariate gaussian distribution with covariance matrix estimated from the previous points in the chains .",
    "by taking into account the covariances among the parameters , we effectively approximate the likelihood contour in extent and orientation  the gaussian samples are taken along the principal axis of the likelihood contour . denoting @xmath42 for notational convenience , the proposal distribution we use for the steps is @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the covariance matrix @xmath46 the sampling is most easily performed by diagonalizing the covariance matrix @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an orthogonal matrix . using this , equation ( [ eqn::gauss ] )",
    "becomes @xmath49 \\\\   & & =   n \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\bi{v}_i^t \\bi{d}^{-1 } \\bi{v}_i\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the procedure for obtaining a sample @xmath51 is as follows :    1 .   find the eigenvalues @xmath52 and eigenvectors of @xmath53 .",
    "construct the transformation matrix @xmath48 from the eigenvectors .",
    "2 .   draw gaussian samples with variances @xmath52 , thereby obtaining the vector @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 is the desired sample from the multivariate gaussian with covariance matrix @xmath53 .",
    "the convergence can be further improved by scaling the covariance matrix @xmath45 with a variable factor @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath56 , we can cope better in situations where the projected likelihood takes on banana shapes such as in @xcite .",
    "it also improves the convergence during the early stages when the low number of points available limits the estimate of the covariance matrix @xmath53 .",
    "we dynamically increase @xmath56 if a chain takes steps too often , while we decrease @xmath56 if the acceptance rate is too low .. ] the positive effect of our scheme on the convergence is illustrated in figure [ fig::convergence ] .",
    "one can show that modifying the proposal distribution based on previous chain data during the run may lead to a wrong stationary distribution @xmath57@xcite .",
    "therefore , we only apply the dynamical strategy of finding an optimal step proposal during the early stages of the simulation . when the convergence is better than @xmath58 and the chain has calculated a certain number of points , we freeze in the step proposal distribution .",
    "all points in the chain before this freeze in should be discarded ( see also [ appendix::format ] ) .",
    "-statistic as a function of number of models computed . the univariate gaussian proposal distribution using fixed variances but adaptive overall step size @xmath56 ( black dashed curve ) shows convergence after about 2800 iterations . the multivariate gaussian proposal distribution with covariance matrix estimated from the previous chain points and adaptive overall step size @xmath56 as suggested in this paper ( red solid curve ) converges after 500 iterations . ]",
    "the package is part of cmbeasy and consists of two main components .",
    "the first one is a mcmc driver using lam / mpi @xcite for parallel execution of each chain .",
    "the second one is the analyzethis class which is designed to evaluate the likelihood of a given model with respect to various data sets .",
    "these sets include the latest data of wmap tt and te @xcite , acbar @xcite , cbi @xcite , vsa @xcite , 2dfgrs @xcite , sdss @xcite , the sne ia compilations of riess et al .",
    "@xcite , tonry et al .",
    "@xcite and knop et .",
    "@xcite as well as the ifa deep survey sne ia data @xcite .",
    "data files for all experiments are included for convenience .",
    "new data sets are added continuously to the code .",
    "the example mcmc driver consists of two routines : master ( ) and slave ( ) . using lam / mpi for parallel computing , one master and up to ten slaves may be started .",
    "the master ( ) will determine the initial random starting position for each chain .",
    "in a never ending loop , it then sends the parameters to the slave ( ) s and collects the results when the computation is finished . whenever a step has been successful , it stores the parameters and likelihoods of the last step together with the number of times the chain remained at the same point in parameter space in a new line of one file per chain .",
    "the format of these raw mcmc data files is defined in [ appendix::format ] .",
    "the master ( ) monitors convergence and mixing and determines the next step for the slave ( ) . before freeze in ,",
    "the covariance is estimated and the step proposal accordingly modified .",
    "after freeze in , the proposal distribution remains unchanged .",
    "the analyzethis class provides several routines concerning cmb , sne ia and large scale structure measurements .",
    "it also contains routines for marginalizing and plotting the monte carlo data .",
    "the wmap routines are ( slightly modified ) c++ ports of the likelihood code @xcite available at the lambda @xcite web site .",
    "when the wmap routines are called for the first time , the covariance matrices provided by wmap will be converted to a binary format to speed up future use .",
    "a routine for wmap normalization of the @xmath59 spectrum using the binned tt may be used instead of the old cobe normalization .",
    "( after the quick normalization , a best fit normalization may be called which uses the full likelihood routine provided by @xcite . )",
    "we use the procedures for likelihood computation described by the acbar , cbi and vsa collaborations @xcite , using window functions and calibration uncertainty .",
    "one can de - select data bins from each of these datasets .",
    "it is , for instance , possible to calculate the likelihood for the low @xmath60 data only , thus speeding up the computation of a model , because the window functions of the high @xmath60 data require multipoles up to @xmath61 .",
    "one may also wish to exclude @xmath62 data if one is using the wmap observations in order to keep the sets independent .      for this large scale structure",
    "dataset one compares the data with the theoretical power spectrum at @xmath63 , the effective redshift of the survey , multiplied with the window function .",

    ", the bias is nearly constant @xcite .",
    "one may either specify the bias or marginalize over it .",
    "the theoretical power spectrum to be compared with the data should be evaluated at the effective redshift of this survey , at @xmath65 .",
    "we use the data given in table 3 of @xcite and the appropriate window functions .",

    "even though the optical depth does not directly influence sne ia predictions , adding sne ia data tightens the bound on the optical depth @xmath77 as seen in figure [ fig::oned ] . the mechanism is somewhat indirect : sne ia data tightens the bound on @xmath99 and thus limits the range of allowed values for @xmath77 , @xmath79 and @xmath78 from cmb measurements . as we marginalize over the bias of the sdss data , large scale structure does not add further to the bounds on @xmath77 .",
    "we have introduced the analyzethis package , which can be used to constrain cosmological models using observational data sets .",
    "the analyzethis class provides many functions to compute the likelihood of a model with respect to measurements of the cmb , sne ia and large scale structure .    in order to constrain models of the universe with a substantial number of parameters ,",
