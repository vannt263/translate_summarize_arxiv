    "given a potential @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , the surface defined by @xmath1 is called the potential energy landscape ( pel ) of the given system @xcite .",
    "the special points of a pel , defined by the solutions of the equations @xmath3 for @xmath4 , provide important information about the pel .",
    "these special points , called critical points or stationary points ( sps ) of the pel , can be further classified according to the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix , @xmath5 .",
    "the sps at which @xmath6 is positive ( negative ) definite are called minima ( maxima ) of the pel and the sps at which @xmath6 has exactly @xmath7 negative eigenvalue are called saddles of index @xmath7 .",
    "sps at which @xmath6 has at least one zero eigenvalue , after removing the global symmetries from the system corresponding to overall translation and rotation , are called singular sps or non - morse points .",
    "the sps of the pel can be employed to calculate or estimate certain physical quantities of interest .",
    "a variety of techniques have been deveoped within the framework of potential energy landscape theory @xcite , with applications to many - body systems as diverse as metallic clusters , biomolecules and their folding transitions , and glass formers .    except for rare examples , like the one - dimensional xy model @xcite",
    ", it is not usually possible to obtain the sps analytically because solving the nonlinear stationary equations can be an extremely difficult task .",
    "hence , one has to rely upon numerical methods .",
    "when a numerical method finds a solution of a given system , it essentially means that it has found a numerical approximation of an exact solution . after achieving a numerical approximate",
    ", one can heuristically validate it by either monitoring iterations of newton s method or by substituting the approximations into the equations to see if they are satisfied up to a chosen tolerance .",
    "usually , such a validation works well in practice .",
    "however , as will be clear from the examples provided below , such heuristic approaches do not guarantee that the numerical approximation will indeed converge quadratically to the associated solutions using arbitrary precision . more specifically ,",
    "even if a numerical approximation is heuristically validated , it could turn out to be a nonsolution at higher precision , or newton iterations may have unpredictable behavior , such as attracting cycles and chaos , when applied to points that are not in a basin of attraction @xcite of  some  solution .",
    "we note that if the given system is a set of polynomial equations , then one can use numerical polynomial homotopy continuation @xcite to compute all the isolated solutions ( see e.g.  @xcite for some related approaches ) .",
    "briefly , the method works as follows : first , one determines an upper bound on the number of isolated complex solutions of the given system .",
    "the highest upper bound on the number of solutions is the so - called classical bezout bound , which is the product of the degree of each polynomial equation of the system , but there are several other tighter upper bounds available for structured systems .",
    "then , one constructs another system that has exactly the same number of solutions as the upper bound , such that the new system is easy to solve .",
    "finally , one uses continuation to track each solution of the new system to the original one . some of the paths may diverge to infinity , which will happen whenever the upper bound is larger than the true number of solutions .",
    "the paths that converge will tend to solutions of the original system in appropriate limits .",
    "this method is quite different from conventional numerical approaches , in that it is guaranteed to find all solutions , in principle .",
    "however , due to the numerical computations used with this method in path tracking , in the end , only numerical approximations are obtained , and hence the above mentioned difficulties may also arise .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a rigorous way to validate the numerical approximates of the sps , independent of the numerical method used to obtain them .    in the mathematics literature , proving that a given numerical approximation will converge quadratically to the nearby associated solution using arbitrary precision is called _",
    "certification_. it is well known that quadratic convergence doubles the number of correct digits after each iteration .",
    "hence the associated solution can be approximated to a given accuracy quite efficiently after a certain number of newton iterations .",
    "smale and others , in the 1980 s , developed a method that certifies a numerical approximation as an actual solution of the system @xcite .",
    "the method is now known as smale s @xmath0-theory .",
    "interestingly , it turned out that the certification could be done via computing three numbers from a given numerical approximate : for a given system of equations @xmath8 and a given point @xmath9 , one computes two numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , which guarantee that newton s method starting from @xmath9 will quadratically converge to a solution of @xmath8 if the number @xmath12 is less than @xmath13 . applying this certification scheme ensures that our numerical solutions are good enough so that more accurate approximations can be obtained easily and efficiently @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we first give details of smale s @xmath0-theory in the context of the pels in section [ sec_smales_theory ] .",
    "then , by providing examples in section [ sec_examples ] , we show how numerical approximates may turn out to be non - solutions even in seemingly simple situations . in passing ,",
    "we certify the solutions of the well - known examples of the wilkinson polynomial under a small perturbation and the roots of the chebyshyv polynomials of the first kind for the first time . in section [ sec : xy_model ] , we consider a more physically relevant potential , i.e. , the two - dimensional xy model without disorder .",
    "we certify all the known sps of this model and provide a guide for conventional numerical methods .",
    "section [ sec_conclusions ] provides an outlook and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we describe smale s @xmath0-theory following ref .  @xcite . we restrict ourselves to square systems , i.e. , systems that have the same number of equations as variables , since sps of a pel satisfy a square system of equations .",
    "smale s @xmath0-theory is usually used to certify complex solutions for systems of analytic functions , so we start by describing this approach @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the certification of real solutions separately .",
    "finally , we will discuss @xmath0-theory applied to polynomial systems and systems involving exponentials and trigonometric functions .",
    "we start by considering a system @xmath14 of @xmath15 multivariate analytic equations in @xmath15 variables .",
    "we denote the set of solutions of @xmath8 as @xmath16 and the jacobian of @xmath14 at @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "consider the newton iteration of @xmath14 starting at @xmath17 defined by @xmath19 for @xmath20 , the @xmath21-th newton iteration is simply @xmath22    now , a point @xmath23 is called an _ approximate solution _ of @xmath14 with _ associated solution _ @xmath24 if , for each @xmath20 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the standard euclidean norm on @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath17 is an approximate solution to @xmath14 if it is in the quadratic convergence basin defined by newton s method of some solution  @xmath28 .",
    "the following theorem provides a sufficient condition for proving that a given point is an approximate solution without knowledge  about  @xmath28 .",
    "* theorem : * if @xmath29 for a square analytic system @xmath14 and point @xmath17 such that @xmath30 exists , then @xmath17 is an approximate solution to @xmath14 , where @xmath31 if @xmath17 is an approximate solution of @xmath14 , then @xmath32 , where @xmath24 is the associated solution to @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , in @xmath33 , the term @xmath34 is the symmetric tensor whose components are the partial derivatives of @xmath14 of order @xmath21 . finally , for convenience",
    ", one can remove the condition on @xmath18 by defining @xmath0 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 appropriately .",
    "if @xmath37 such that @xmath18 is not invertible , define @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . if @xmath41 such that @xmath18 is not invertible , then @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath33 are taken as @xmath44 .    since this theorem provides a sufficient condition for a point to be an approximate solution ,",
    "the set of _ certifiable _ approximate solutions is generally much smaller than the set of approximate solutions , as demonstrated in figures  [ fig : z4 - 1 ] and  [ fig : cheby ] .",
    "however , if it is a true approximate solution , then a few newton iterations usually generate a point that can be certified .    *",
    "distinct complex solutions *    given two approximate solutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 , one often needs to verify that the corresponding associated solutions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are distinct . one way to check this condition uses the triangle inequality together with @xmath49 .",
    "for arbitrary analytic systems , @xmath33 as described in the above theorem may be difficult to compute or bound above .",
    "when @xmath14 is polynomial , @xmath36 is defined as a maximum over finitely many terms and thus can be computed in theory .",
    "often , however , such as in the software package alphacertified @xcite , @xmath33 is bounded above via proposition  8 of @xcite , which depends on the degrees and coefficients of the polynomials in @xmath14 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , which we now briefly summarize .",

    "a system is polynomial - exponential if it is polynomial in both the variables @xmath65 and finitely many exponentials of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "many standard functions such as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 can be formulated as systems of polynomial - exponential functions since they are indeed polynomial functions of @xmath72 for  suitable  @xmath67 .",
    "the above theorem provides a bound on the distance between an approximate solution @xmath17 and its associated solution @xmath28 , namely @xmath73 .",
    "apart from certifying that @xmath17 is indeed an approximate solution , one often wants to prove additional information about @xmath28 .",
    "the theory of newton - invariant sets @xcite provides one approach to this problem .",
    "one particular newton - invariant set of particular interest is @xmath74 when @xmath75 defines a real map , that is , @xmath76 for @xmath77 , which was first observed in @xcite . in this case , one is able to certifiably determine if @xmath78 or @xmath79 given any approximate solution @xmath17 associated with @xmath28 .",
    "the newton iteration corresponding to a potential energy function @xmath80 is a real map if @xmath1 is real for all real @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , one is able to certifiably determine if an associated solution is real or nonreal .",
    "this reality test and other @xmath0-theoretic computations are implemented in the software alphacertified @xcite , which we describe next .",
    "the basin of attraction of each minimum is an important quantity in potential energy landscape studies since the sum of the volumes of all the basins of attraction is related to the entropy of the system .",
    "there is a crucial difference between the basins of attraction and the certifiable region of the same minimum .",
    "the basin of attraction of a minimum can not overlap with that of another minimum , and aside from boundaries the union of all the basins of attraction covers the whole configuration space .",
    "however , the certified region of a minimum is contained within the basin of attraction of the minimum .",
    "hence , the sum of the certifiable regions is generally a subset of this space .",
    "the software alphacertified @xcite performs computations related to @xmath0-theory .",
    "the input system must be presented exactly with rational coefficients . when the internal computations are performed using exact rational arithmetic via gmp @xcite , all results are rigorous and",
    "thus provide a _ mathematical proof of the computed results_.",
    "this framework provides an alternative to other analytic or symbolic computations for yielding computational proofs . since each solution can be independently certified , the procedures are parallelizable .    from the exact input system , which is either",
    "a system of polynomial or polynomial - exponential functions , the jacobian is constructed exactly . for these systems ,",
    "the value of @xmath36 is bounded above , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : specialnonlinear ] , eliminating the need to compute the higher - order derivatives .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is also bounded above .    since the magnitude of the rational numbers can increase during a sequence of exact computations , alphacertified also permits the use of arbitrary precision floating - point arithmetic via mpfr @xcite . when using floating - point arithmetic , the round - off errors are not explicitly controlled but can be reduced by increasing  the  precision .",
    "in this section , we provide several other example systems illustrating many possible scenarios in which a conventional numerical method may face difficulty in obtaining numerical approximates .",
    "we start with a simple example of one equation in one variable followed by a few other examples exhibiting different numerical issues .      for the system @xmath81 , we demonstrate the explicit computation of @xmath82 and @xmath36 . since @xmath83 is zero if and only if @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we can safely assume that @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 .",
    "now , the term @xmath88 in @xmath89 is simply the @xmath21-th derivative of @xmath14 at @xmath90 , namely @xmath91 . since @xmath14 has degree @xmath92",
    ", we only need to take the maximum over @xmath93 to compute @xmath89 .",
    "it is easy to show that the maximum is attained at @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "thus , @xmath96  for  @xmath86 .    for @xmath97",
    ", we have @xmath98 and thus @xmath97 can not be certified as an approximate solution .",
    "it is indeed outside of all of the quadratic convergence basins .",
    "however , at the point @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 is certifiably an approximate solution of @xmath8 . in this case , we know that the associated solution is @xmath101 , and table [ tab : i ] confirms the quadratic convergence for a few iterations .    figure  [ fig : z4 - 1 ] plots the basins of convergence starting at points @xmath102 for @xmath103 of newton s method applied to @xmath14 . in this plot , the white areas are the certifiable quadratic convergence basins which lie inside of the respective quadratic convergence basins .",
    "these quadratic convergence basins lie inside of the respective linear convergence basins with chaotic behavior separating the linear convergence  basins .",
    "the structure is similar to that observed for convergence of alternative optimisation algorithms for atomic clusters in previous work @xcite .",
    ".convergence to @xmath101 for @xmath104 starting at @xmath105 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using @xmath0-theory , one can also certifiably determine the index .",
    "this certificate would protect against a true solution having a small eigenvalue that changes sign when using an approximation of the solution .",
    "due to complications of expanding determinants for large matrices , we use a eigenvalue vector / value formulation at the expense of increasing the size of the system .",
    "the resulting system is of the form @xmath106 = { \\bf 0}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the hessian of @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath108 is defined up to scaling , we dehomogenize using a sufficiently random patch and then convert to a polynomial system with the same subsitution as above .",
    "solving nonlinear equations is one of the most frequently arising mathematical problems in theoretical chemistry , e.g. , in finding minima and transition states of a potential energy function or finding steady states of chemical rate equations , etc .",
    "it is customary to resort to a numerical method to solve such systems , aside from the rare instances when the equations can be solved exactly . for a numerical method , a solution of a given system means a numerical approximation of an actual solution .",
    "it is quite likely that such a numerical approximation is a nonsolution of the system , i.e. , it may lie in the linear convergence basin or in a chaotic region , instead of the quadratic region of convergence . in many cases , such false numerical approximations",
    "may leave us with fundamentally different , and incorrect conclusions . in our previous paper @xcite , we employed smale s @xmath0-theory which _ certifies _ if a given numerical approximation is in the quadratic convergence region of an actual solution of the system . in the present work ,",
    "we have elaborated the mathematical concepts and a related software called alphacertified .",
    "we then used the certification procedure to explore the solution space of a simple problem , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , which already shows several regions where a numerical method may fall into chaotic regions .",
    "we also showed the certified regions of the known four solutions of this system .",
    "then , we picked two celebrated examples , the wilkinson polynomial and a chebyshev polynomial of the first kind . for both systems , we explored the solution spaces and identified the certified regions as well as regions of linear convergence and chaotic convergences .",
    "finally we considered the xy model in two dimensions without disorder .",
    "there , we took the already known numerical approximations of the saddles of all the possible indices , for the lattice sizes up to @xmath111 and tried to certify the solutions .",
    "we chose this system to demonstrate the applicability of the @xmath0-theory to systems that are not in the polynomial form . in these systems , the higher the lattice dimension is the higher the required accuracy from a numerical method , otherwise the numerical approximations do not fall into the quadratic convergence region , as for the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xcite .",
    "we used alphacertified to refine the numerical approximations whenever they were not in the quadratic convergence regions of the corresponding solutions .",
    "we also observe that , in contrast to the lj case @xcite , for the xy model , the size of the quadratic convergence region ( or the certified region ) remains fairly constant as @xmath112 increases .",
    "one needs to be careful here because this difference may also arise if the technique used to find the sps did not find the more ill - conditioned solutions ( the ones with smaller quadratic convergence basins ) .",
    "we anticipate that the certification method presented in this paper will turn out to be a standard tool to verify the numerical sps obtained from various numerical methods .",
    "another possible application is to make rigorous statements about sps random potential surfaces , such as the ones studied in statistical physics and cosmology , as well as in pure mathematics @xcite .",
