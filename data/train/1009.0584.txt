    "it has long been a subject of controversy whether the magnetic field ( mf ) in the central region of our galaxy has a dipolar or toroidal geometry on a large scale .",
    "previous observations have been mainly based on sub - millimeter polarimetric observations of dense molecular clouds , or radio observations of non - thermal radio filaments .",
    "the former show that the mfs in the dense molecular clouds run almost parallel to the galactic plane , indicating a _ toroidal _ mf @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the radio filaments are aligned nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite , and are highly polarized along the filaments long axes @xcite , suggesting a large - scale , pervasive _ poloidal _",
    "mf in the intercloud medium .",
    "the mfs both in dense molecular clouds and in the diffuse interstellar ( intercloud ) medium are observable via optical and near - infrared ( nir ) polarimetry of intrinsically unpolarized stars with the polarization attributed to differential extinction by dust grains aligned with their short axis along the direction of the mf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the polarization vectors of such stars trace the orientation of the mf projected onto the plane of the sky , and measurements of stars at different distances reveal the change of the projected mf orientation along the line of sight .",
    "although there are numerous stars near the galactic center ( gc ) , high extinction by the intervening dust grains means that infrared polarimetry is ideal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in understanding the mf configuration in the gc",
    ". however , infrared polarimety toward the gc has been carried out for only a limited number of stars so far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in this letter , we report observations of the gc region with a wide - field nir polarimeter . in the first paper of this series @xcite",
    ", we presented the mf configuration in the @xmath5 region of the gc . in the following observations from 2007 ,",
    "more than 300,000 stars are detected in the central @xmath0 region with an error in the degree of polarization less than 1% .",
    "the statistical treatment of the large number of stars enables us to obtain the first large - scale view of the mf in the gc .",
    "polarimetry for a large number of stars in the central @xmath0 region of the galaxy was obtained with irsf / sirpol between july 2006 and august 2009 .",
    "sirpol consists of a single - beam polarimeter ( a half - wave plate rotator unit and a fixed wire - grid polarizer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the nir imaging camera sirius ( simultaneous infrared imager for unbiased survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is attached to the 1.4-m telescope irsf ( infrared survey facility ) .",
    "the detectors are three 1024 @xmath6 1024 hgcdte arrays , with a scale of 045 pixel@xmath7 .",
    "sirpol provides images of a 77 @xmath6 77 area of sky in three nir bands , @xmath1 ( @xmath8 m ) , @xmath2 ( @xmath9 m ) , and @xmath3 ( @xmath10 m ) , simultaneously .",
    "the filter system of irsf / sirpol is similar to the mauna kea observatory system @xcite .",
    "10-s exposures were made , at each 4 wave plate angles ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and at each of 10 dithered positions .",
    "the weather condition was photometric , with a mean seeing of @xmath1513 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath1512 ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath1511 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "twilight flats were obtained before and after the observations .",
    "the iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) software package was used to perform dark- and flat - field corrections , followed by sky background estimation and subtraction .",
    "to obtain the photometric magnitudes and errors , we used the daophot package @xcite .",
    "the sources detected in stokes @xmath16 images [ @xmath17 were input to the allstar task for psf - fitting photometry .",
    "about 10 sources were used to construct the psf in each image .",
    "photometric calibration was performed with reference to the magnitudes of point sources in the 2mass catalog @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for point sources were determined from aperture polarimetry , which gives a better photometric result than psf - fitting photometry in our gc data .",
    "we obtained the intensity for each wave plate angle ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) with iraf daofind and apphot tasks .",
    "the size of the aperture is slightly different among fields due to variations of the seeing , and an aperture size of 1.5 @xmath6 fwhm was adopted , which was measured on stokes @xmath16 images .",
    "our data analysis results in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 sources in the observed area with an error @xmath27 in the degree of polarization @xmath28 less than 1% , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ^ 2 + \\left ( \\frac{u}{i } \\right)^2 \\left [ \\delta \\left ( \\frac{u}{i } \\right ) \\right]^2 } .\\ ] ] polarimetric accuracy was checked with duplicate sources in overlapping regions of adjacent fields observed under different atmospheric condition .",
    "the means of the average differences of @xmath31 and @xmath32 were 0.26 % and 0.27 % in the @xmath2 band , and 0.25 % and 0.26 % in the @xmath3 band , respectively .    to derive the mf configuration at the gc , we separated stars into two subgroups according to their colors : `` blue '' and `` red '' stars .",
    "most of the stars detected in the observations are late - type giants near the gc , and their intrinsic @xmath33 colors are almost the same colors of the observed giants in the gc is calculated to be 0.06 from the galactic model by @xcite .",
    "this is small enough compared to the mean of the color ranges of red and blue stars , @xmath34 .",
    "therefore we proceed on the supposition that the observed colors of the giants depend on the distance to them . ] .",
    "so their observed colors depend on the amount of the interstellar extinction which in turn depends generally on the distance to the stars .",
    "the `` red '' ( `` blue '' ) stars suffer strong ( weak ) extinction , and thus they are distributed at the far ( near ) side of the gc .",
    "the light from stars at the near side of the gc ( i.e. , `` blue '' stars ) is transmitted through the interstellar dust in the galactic disk , and the polarization is produced there , whereas the light from stars at the far side of the gc ( i.e. , `` red '' stars ) is transmitted through the dust in the disk _ and _ the gc . by comparing the stokes parameters ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) of the `` blue '' and `` red '' stars , we obtain polarization of the gc component ( see * ? ? ? * for more detail ) .    as a first step in deriving the mf configuration at the gc",
    ", the field was divided into sub - fields of @xmath35 , and @xmath33 histograms were made for each sub - field .",
    "these histograms were fitted with the gaussian function , and means ( @xmath36 ) and sigmas ( @xmath37 ) were calculated for each sub - field . using the mean and sigma values , the stars were divided into two subgroups : `` blue '' stars with the color of @xmath38 , and `` red '' stars with @xmath39 .",
    "mean ( @xmath36 ) and sigma ( @xmath37 ) in the @xmath33 histograms were determined for stars with @xmath40 , which are bright enough to avoid the influence of the limiting magnitude , @xmath41 ( see also fig .",
    "7 of * ? ? ?",
    "this means that our observations are equally sensitive to stars on the far and near sides of the gc , and using this criterion , stars on both sides of the gc can be distinguished .",
    "the `` blue '' and `` red '' stars are in fact distributed evenly in the @xmath35 sub - fields .",
    "hence , it can be safely assumed that the peaks in the @xmath33 histograms correspond to a real peak of spatial distribution of stars along the line of sight .",
    "next , @xmath31 and @xmath32 histograms in the @xmath3 band were constructed for the `` blue '' and `` red '' stars with @xmath42 in each sub - field .",
    "their means , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , were used to obtain the degree @xmath28 and position angle @xmath47 of polarization for `` red '' minus `` blue '' ( i.e. , gc component ) with the following equations @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 the errors of @xmath50 and @xmath51 were calculated from the standard error on the mean @xmath52 of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 histograms , where @xmath53 is the standard deviation and @xmath54 is the number of stars .",
    "a few sub - fields with strong extinction are excluded from our analysis .",
    "we confirmed that the ratio of the number of the `` red '' and `` blue '' stars in each sub - field has a mean of @xmath55 even near the galactic plane ( @xmath56 ) , suggesting no bias effect to detect more stars at the near side than the far side of the gc due to strong extinction .",
    "finally , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are averaged in a circle of 24 radius with a 30 grid , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are calculated with the equations ( [ eq : prb ] ) and ( [ eq : thetarb ] ) .",
    "the resultant mean and rms of @xmath57 are 0.29 % and 0.12 % in the @xmath3 band , respectively .",
    "the strong concentration of stars towards the gc allows measurement of the mf structure in the gc region .",
    "most of the stars detected in our observations have an intrinsic color of red giants with spectral type of k and m. we used a galactic model @xcite to show the degree of central concentration of the stars along the line of sight , and found that more than 85 % of stars within the central @xmath0 region are expected to be within 300 pc of the gc .",
    "so the observed position angles of polarization of the gc component show those of mfs , averaged along the lines of sight , in the central few - hundred pc .",
    "[ fig : vmap ] shows the mf direction ( @xmath59-vectors of polarization of the gc component in the @xmath3 band ) in the gc .",
    "this is the first large - scale view of the mf in this region .",
    "the mf directions in the dense molecular clouds , measured with sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) and far - infrared ( fir ) polarimetry , are overplotted on the @xmath3 data in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmapsubmmco ] .",
    "the panel ( a ) shows the mf directions derived from polarimetry in a large survey at 450 @xmath60 m @xcite . near the sagittarius a region ,",
    "sub - mm polarimetry has been carried out with better spatial resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vmapsubmmco ] b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both cases ,",
    "the mf directions derived from the sub - mm / fir polarimetry are well matched with the nir observations .",
    "it follows that the position angle of polarization derived from nir polarimetry can be used to determine the direction of the mf in the gc .",
    "the mf direction has strong dependence on the galactic latitude , i.e. , distance from the galactic plane , but not on the galactic longitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hists ] ) . the mf direction ( i.e. , the position angle of polarization ) is defined as the angular offset in degrees from north through east in galactic coordinates .",
    "the histogram of the mf direction at @xmath61 has a clear peak of @xmath62 , suggesting a toroidal mf configuration in this region . at higher galactic latitude ( @xmath63 )",
    ", the mean mf direction appears to swing from @xmath64 to @xmath65 which is nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "these results suggest a transition of the large - scale mf configuration from toroidal to poloidal in the gc region , at @xmath66 .    in the central few hundred pc region , there are some structures surrounding the gc , such as the 180-pc ( or expanding ) molecular ring @xcite , and the gc molecular arms composing a ring of radius of @xmath67 pc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult to completely exclude the possibility that we are preferentially probing magnetic fields in these molecular structures .",
    "however , it seems to be convincing that we have detected the magnetic fields in molecular clouds much closer to the gc , from the following points . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmapsubmmco ] ( see also fig",

    "* ) , we are able to replicate the detailed structure of the sub - mm / fir magnetic field maps in the circumnuclear disk , and two molecular clouds m@xmath68 ( + 50 km s@xmath7 cloud ) and m@xmath69 ( + 20 km s@xmath7 cloud ) .",
    "these two molecular clouds are located within several tens of pc from the gc , and the possibility of contribution of foreground emission was also ruled out @xcite . hence we can probe the magnetic fields very close to the gc .",
    "previously , the mf configuration of the gc has been viewed as poloidal in the diffuse , interstellar ( intercloud ) medium , and approximately parallel to the galactic plane only in the dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the new data presented here shows a toroidal mf prevails at @xmath70 , even outside the dense molecular clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vmapsubmmco ] ) , which radio @xcite and sub - mm @xcite surveys show are mostly confined to within @xmath71 of the galactic plane . toward higher galactic latitudes ( @xmath4 ) , the field changes from a toroidal to a poloidal configuration .    since sirpol also provides images in the @xmath2 band , it is possible to compare these with the @xmath3-band results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vmap ] ) .",
    "most of the position angles of polarization in the @xmath2 band show the same direction as that in the @xmath3 bands within their errors .",
    "in addition , there is a good correlation between the degree of polarization @xmath28 in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands with @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath73 for a power - law approximation @xmath74 which represents the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization at nir wavelengths , consistent with previous results toward the gc ( @xmath75 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation coefficients in the degree and position angle of polarization are 0.71 and 0.92 , respectively , showing strong correlation between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the differential extinction by magnetically aligned dust grains is responsible for the observed nir polarization .",
    "the existence of the toroidal mf even in the intercloud medium near the galactic plane is consistent with the observations of galactic center diffuse x - ray ( gcdx ) emission @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the 6.7 kev line emission from helium - like ions of iron is elliptical with a major axis approximately along the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the gcdx is as yet unclear , recent observations with the suzaku satellite found a smooth and monotonic variation of the ionization temperature along the galactic longitude , and a clear difference of distribution between the 6.7 kev line flux and an integrated point source flux , suggesting hot , diffuse interstellar plasma in origin @xcite . if a poloidal mf is pervasive in this region , since the gravitational well of the gc region is far too shallow to confine them , the hot plasma must be rushing out of the plane vertically as a galactic wind .",
    "such a vertical extension of the gcdx has not been observed .",
    "the large - scale mf configuration has important implications for understanding the origin of a variety of magnetic phenomena .",
    "the double helix nebula @xcite extends almost perpendicular to the galactic plane from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "it exists in the region of the large - scale poloidal mf , so the nebula probably results from a dynamically ordered interstellar phenomenon involving its local interstellar mfs . on the other hand ,",
    "a large part of the non - thermal radio filaments exist at @xmath78 where the toroidal field is dominant @xcite .",
    "hence the filaments do not run along the mf directions we obtained ; rather , they are almost perpendicular to the local mf .",
    "this implies that it is important to reconsider the simple picture in which the non - thermal filaments are illuminated flux tubes within a uniform poloidal mf @xcite , for the origin of the filaments .",
