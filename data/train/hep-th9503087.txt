    ". the black hole solutions on the lower branches are linearly stable @xcite .",
    "thus for a certain range of masses the system possesses two distinct classically stable types of black holes , providing a counterexample to the `` no - hair conjecture '' for black holes .    beside the black hole solutions the su(2 ) einstein - skyrme system also possesses two branches of regular solutions , which merge at a critical coupling constant @xcite .",
    "again , the solutions on the lower branch are classically stable @xcite , they correspond to solitons . for zero coupling",
    "the lower branch starts from the su(2 ) skyrmion solution in flat space @xcite , while the upper branch ends in the lowest su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills sphaleron solution @xcite ( after scaling the radial coordinate @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider particle - like solutions and black holes in the su(3 ) einstein - skyrme system . in the su(3 ) skyrme model in flat space regular static spherically symmetric solutions exist for both subgroups su(2 ) and so(3 ) @xcite .",

    "we argue , that the so(3 ) black hole solutions on the lower branch are classically stable .",

    "( [ eqa ] ) the metric function @xmath36 can be eliminated from the matter equations .",
    "the einstein - skyrme system has a topological current @xmath37 which is covariantly conserved , yielding the topological charge @xmath38",
    "let us consider the regular particle - like solutions of the su(3 ) einstein - skyrme system .",
    "requiring asymptotically flat solutions implies that the metric functions @xmath36 and @xmath39 both approach a constant at infinity , and that the chiral functions approach an integer multiple of @xmath40 .",

    "the topological charge of the solutions @xcite @xmath53 depends only on the boundary conditions . for the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) the topological charge is @xmath1 and @xmath54 , respectively . in the following we present the numerical solutions for the so(3 ) embedding with boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) , corresponding to @xmath1 solutions , since the solutions of the su(2 ) embedding reproduce the known su(2 ) results .",
    "the regular so(3 ) einstein - skyrme solutions and the regular su(2 ) einstein - skyrme solutions have many features in common .",

    "we therefore refer to this branch as the skyrmion branch . in the limit",
    "@xmath62 the solutions on the upper branch shrink to zero size , while their mass diverges .",

    "skyrmion solution in flat space , the regular solutions change continuously , and reach finally the so(3 ) sphaleron solution @xcite , where they shrink to zero size ( with respect to the coordinate @xmath32 ) . along this path",
    ", the solutions can be characterized , for instance , by the derivative of @xmath68 at the origin , which changes monotonically . as an example",

    "the existence of a regular event horizon at @xmath70 requires @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the chiral functions must satisfy at the horizon @xmath70 @xmath73    again , the so(3 ) einstein - skyrme black holes and the su(2 ) einstein - skyrme black holes have many features in common . for a given horizon @xmath70",

    "the families of so(3 ) black hole solutions for various values of the horizon @xmath70 change continuously , when @xmath51 is increased from zero along the skyrmion branch up to the critical coupling @xmath78 , and then decreased back to zero along the sphaleron branch . at zero coupling on the skyrmion branch",
    "the solutions correspond to schwarzschild black holes with `` chiral hair '' . as examples we show the radial functions for the so(3 ) black hole solutions with the horizons @xmath79 , 0.10 , 0.15 and 0.20 along the skyrmion branch for @xmath69 in figs .",
    "( [ chi])-([a ] ) .",
    "further details of these solutions as well as the so(3 ) einstein - yang - mills black holes will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "like the regular su(2 ) solutions with topological number @xmath2 , the regular so(3 ) solutions with topological number @xmath1 form two branches , a skyrmion branch and a sphaleron branch , existing below a critical coupling .",
    "the corresponding critical su(2 ) and so(3 ) couplings are @xmath61 @xcite and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "( thus the critical coupling of the b=2 solutions in the so(3 ) embedding is considerably larger than that of the b=2 solutions in the su(2 ) embedding @xcite . ) for vanishing coupling , the lower branch of the regular so(3 ) solutions starts at the @xmath1 skyrmion in flat space @xcite , and the upper branch ends in the lowest so(3 ) einstein - yang - mills sphaleron @xcite ( after scaling the radial coordinate ) .    for a given coupling",
    "constant , on both branches the mass of the regular so(3 ) solution with @xmath1 is smaller than twice the mass of the su(2 ) solution with @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 su(2 ) and the @xmath1 so(3 ) skyrmion solutions in flat space are stable @xcite , and the full su(2 ) skyrmion branch is stable @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that the full so(3 ) skyrmion branch is also stable .",
    "general arguments from catastrophe theory imply a change of stability at the critical coupling constant .",
    "( this fact is also known for skyrmions coupled to vector bosons in flat space @xcite . ) for the su(2 ) case it was shown explicitly , that one eigenvalue passes zero at the critical coupling @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) solutions on the sphaleron branch then possess one unstable mode @xcite .",
    "( note , that the lowest su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills sphaleron , has two unstable modes @xcite . )",
    "therefore we argue , that a change of stability takes place at the cusp for the so(3 ) solutions as well .",
    "the so(3 ) solutions on the sphaleron branch then should possess one unstable mode .    for a given value of the event horizon , the so(3 ) black hole solutions",
    "also form two branches , a skyrmion branch and a sphaleron branch , with a bifurcation point at a critical coupling .",
    "this critical coupling depends on the horizon , and decreases with increasing horizon .",
    "the @xmath2 su(2 ) skyrmion branch is known to be stable , while the sphaleron branch is unstable with one unstable mode @xcite . invoking arguments from catstrophe theory again @xcite , we conjecture , that the @xmath1 so(3 ) skyrmion branch is stable , too , while the sphaleron branch is unstable with one unstable mode , acquired at the critical coupling . since the so(3 ) einstein - skyrme system also contains the schwarzschild black holes ,",
    "there are then for a certain range of coupling constants ( depending on the event horizon ) , three black hole solutions , two of which are stable : the schwarzschild solution and the black hole solution with `` chiral hair '' on the skyrmion branch .",
    "this then provides an additional counterexample to the `` no - hair conjecture '' .",
    "the su(2 ) einstein - skyrme model has a rich spectrum of particle - like solutions and black holes @xcite , on the one hand corresponding to solutions in higher topological sectors and on the other hand corresponding to solutions related to the excited su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills sphalerons @xcite and black holes @xcite .",
    "for the so(3 ) einstein - skyrme system we expect a similarly rich spectrum , which is presently under investigation .",
