    "recently , generalized frequency division multiplexing ( gfdm ) has been paid more attention in the 5th generation cellular networks for its flexible pulse shaping in time and frequency @xcite .",
    "since the gfdm transmitter filter has small sidelobes , gfdm can obtain lower spectral leakage than orthogonal frequency devision multiplexing ( ofdm ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the circularly shaped waveforms of the transmitter filter @xcite make the gfdm signal discontinuous , which causes the spectral leakage and reduces the spectral efficiency in gfdm systems .",
    "thus , to achieve the requirement of high spectral efficiency in the 5th generation communications @xcite , a significant sidelobe suppression performance is required .    to suppress the spectral leakage ,",
    "the windowing technique has been adopted to gfdm signal in @xcite .",
    "however , the extended guard interval used to avoid signal distortion results in a reduction in spectral efficiency . meanwhile , as analyzed in @xcite , a ramp - up at the beginning of each gfdm symbol and a ramp - down at the end of each gfdm symbol will be caused .",
    "there has been many sidelobe suppression techniques for ofdm signal @xcite which can be applied to gfdm signal .",
    "cancellation carriers in @xcite consume extra power and cause performance loss in terms of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and data rate .",
    "interference cancellation methods @xcite lead to severe inter symbol interference ( isi ) among multiple symbols while requiring large - scale matrix operations for a wide optimization frequency band .",
    "the precoding methods @xcite have a promising sidelobe suppression performance at the cost of high complexity at the transmitter @xcite and receiver @xcite .",
    "_ n_-continuous ofdm ( nc - ofdm ) techniques @xcite make the ofdm signal and its first _",
    "n _ derivatives continuous , termed as _",
    "n_-continuous , to achieve a considerable sidelobe suppression performance .",
    "conventional nc - ofdm @xcite utilizes a precoder to obtain _",
    "n_-continuous signal at the price of increased complexity and high interference . to optimize the precoder in nc - ofdm @xcite , the technique in @xcite nulls the spectrum at several chosen frequencies at the expense of the bit - to - error ratio ( ber ) performance degradation .",
    "the precoder in @xcite improves the ber performance compared to that in @xcite , but results in data rate loss .",
    "aiming at the low - complexity signal recovery for nc - ofdm signal , several techniques have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "however , the technique in @xcite causes a significant increase in transmitter complexity when searching the optimal data sequence with minimum interference , and the method in @xcite also increases transmitter complexity in the calculation of cancellation tones . in @xcite , time - domain _ n_-continuous ofdm ( td - nc - ofdm )",
    "is proposed to reduce the precoder complexity of the conventional nc - ofdm while maintaining as good sidelobe suppression as the conventional nc - ofdm , but still causes high interference .    in this paper , in order to achieve significant sidelobe suppression , based on @xcite , a time - domain _ n_-continuous gfdm ( td - nc - gfdm ) is proposed by adding a smooth signal into the gfdm symbol .",
    "the smooth signal is a linear combination of the basis signals in a new basis set , which is designed by the gfdm transmitter filter and its high - order derivatives . to reduce the interference caused by the smooth signal , we adopt two solutions .",
    "the first one is an iterative signal recovery algorithm for the received td - nc - gfdm signal by a calculated decoding matrix , which increases the receiver complexity . to avoid the complexity of the signal recovery algorithm , in the second solution , a low - interference td - nc - gfdm",
    "is presented by redesigning the basis signals . in this paper ,",
    "a redesign of the basis signals is to truncate the aforementioned basis signals in td - nc - gfdm by a smooth window function .",
    "after the linear combination of the redesigned basis signals , the resulted smooth signal is aligned with the beginning of the gfdm symbol and added in the front part of the gfdm symbol .",
    "furthermore , for the truncation design of the basis signals , the low - interference scheme has lower implementation complexity than td - nc - gfdm .",
    "additionally , it is proved that when the number of gfdm subsymbols in each gfdm symbol block is bigger than 1 , the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) in td - nc - gfdm is much higher than that in td - nc - ofdm .",
    "simulation results shows that td - nc - gfdm and its low - interference scheme can obtain much more rapid sidelobe decaying than td - nc - ofdm , and the low - interference td - nc - gfdm can obtain the same ber performance as the original gfdm , which has the close ber performance to ofdm for a small roll - off factor of the transmitter filter .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , conventional gfdm transmitter and receiver are introduced .",
    "section iii presents the td - nc - gfdm at the transmitter followed by the signal recovery algorithm at the receiver , gives the low - interference td - nc - gfdm , and analyzes the sir of the td - nc - gfdm signal .",
    "simulation results follows in section iv . finally , in section v , this paper is concluded .",
    "in gfdm transmitter , bit streams are first modulated to complex symbols @xmath0 that are divided into sequences of _ km _ symbols long in the _ i_th gfdm symbol . each sequence ( as a vector ) @xmath1^{\\rm t}$ ] with @xmath2^{\\rm t}$ ] , @xmath3 , is spread on _ k _ subcarriers in _",

    "<S> generalized frequency division multiplexing ( gfdm ) has been a candidate multicarrier scheme in the 5th generation cellular networks for its flexibility of transmitter filter in time and frequency . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the circularly shaped transmitter filter , gfdm provides limited performance gain of sidelobe suppression . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a scheme , called time - domain _ n_-continuous gfdm ( td - nc - gfdm ) , to reduce the discontinuities caused by the gfdm transmitter filter and achieve promising sidelobe suppression gain . based on time - domain _ n_-continuous orthogonal frequency devision multiplexing ( td - nc - ofdm ) </S>",
    "<S> , td - nc - gfdm signal can be obtained by superposing a smooth signal in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> the smooth signal is linearly combined by basis signals in a new basis set related to gfdm transmitter waveform . to eliminate the interference caused by the smooth signal , </S>",
    "<S> two solutions are proposed . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a signal recovery algorithm for reception is adopted at the cost of high complexity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , secondly , to simplify the td - nc - gfdm receiver , a low - interference td - nc - gfdm is proposed by redesigning the basis signals . </S>",
    "<S> a soft truncation of the basis signals in td - nc - gfdm is given to design the basis signals in the low - interference td - nc - gfdm . </S>",
    "<S> then , the smooth signal is aligned with the beginning of the gfdm symbol and is added in the front part of the gfdm symbol . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for a big number of gfdm subsymbols , theoretical analysis proves that the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) in td - nc - gfdm is much higher than that in td - nc - ofdm . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results shows that td - nc - gfdm can obtain significant sidelobe suppression performance as well as the low - interference td - nc - gfdm , which can achieve the same ber performance as the original gfdm .    </S>",
