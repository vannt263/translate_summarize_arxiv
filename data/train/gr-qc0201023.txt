    "the thomas preceession refers to the precession of a gyroscope along an arbitrary path in minkowski space .",
    "it was originally calculated by thomas @xcite , when discussing the orbital motion of a spinning electron in an atom .",
    "we shall consider here the particular case of a circular orbit .",
    "after the seminal work of thomas , his result has been reobtained using many different approaches and techniques .",
    "however it is important to keep in mind , that any calculation of the thomas precession involves explicitly ( or implicitly ) not only the transformation law to the rotating frame , but what is more fundamental , a relationship between the tangential velocity and the radial distance from the axis of rotation ( see eq.([v ] ) below ) ) , which is implied by the transformation law . in other words",
    "it is the very definition of a rotating observer ( and also that of `` rotation '' itself ) which is at stake here .",
    "different definitions lead to different results for thomas precession , independently of the approach used to perform such calculations .",
    "let us recall that since the early days of special relativity , the well known set of equations @xmath1 has been adopted , relating the non - rotating coordinate system of the frame @xmath2 ( in cylindrical coordinates ) to the coordinates @xmath3 of the frame @xmath4 rotating uniformly about @xmath5-axis on the @xmath6 plane .",
    "it should be emphazised that there is nothing `` wrong '' with ( [ gal ] ) ( hereafter referred to as gal ) as a coordinate transformation .",
    "obviously , this or any other regular transformation is acceptable , and any physical experiment whose result is expressed through invariants , should yield the same answer for any observer .",
    "however , when we assume that gal defines a rotating frame , we are adopting a precise definition of a rotating observer . different definitions of rotating observers are associated with different transformations . in other words , one thing is using gal ( which always can be done ) and another , quite different thing is using gal and assume that @xmath4 defines a uniformly rotating frame about @xmath5-axis on the @xmath6 plane .",
    "therefore when we say that something ( say a gyroscope ) is rotating , we must specify what we mean by this .",
    "this may be done by specifying the relationship between the rotating and the inertial ( non - rotating ) observer ( e.g. using gal )",
    ".    however the `` galilean '' character of gal ( understood as a transformation to a rotating frame ) renders it questionable at the ultrarelativistic regime .",
    "particularly troublesome is the fact that ( [ gal ] ) implies that the galilean composite law of velocities applies in flagrant contradiction with special relativity @xcite@xcite .    in order to overcome this problem a different transformation law",
    "was independently proposed by trocheris @xcite and takeno @xcite .    in cylindrical",
    "coordinates the trocheris - takeno ( tt ) transformation reads @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 with @xmath10 where primes correspond to the rotating frame and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the velocity of light and the the angular velocity of the rotating frame defined by gal , respectively .",
    "it can be easily seen @xcite,@xcite , that ( [ tt ] ) leads to the relativistic law of composition of velocities and yields for the velocity of a fixed point in @xmath4 , the expression @xmath13 sending to infinity the `` light cylinder '' .",
    "however , as it has been recently brought out @xcite , tt is not without its problems . in particular ,",
    "the fact that proper time intervals are independent of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and that the length of a circle of radius @xmath14 measured in @xmath4 is @xmath16 , contradict `` relativistic '' intuition ( see the letter of einstein to j.petzoldt , quoted in @xcite ) .    accordingly a modification of tt was proposed in @xcite to remove those objections .",
    "the modified tt transformation ( mtt ) reads @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 or , solving for @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 \\label{mtttp}\\ ] ] @xmath23 \\label{mttfp}\\ ] ]    two points deserve to be stressed :    1 .",
    "the expressions for unprimed ( primed ) coordinates do not follow from the expressions for primed ( unprimed ) coordinates , by changing @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; @xmath26 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in the derivation of mtt , as given in @xcite , the group properties of the rotation have been broken , by admitting a linear term in @xmath12 in the expressions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see equation ( 20 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is a desirable feature of these transformations since , unlike the case of lorentz transformations between two inertial frames , now @xmath2 and @xmath4 are physically different ( one is inertial , whereas the other is not ) .",
    "2 .   it should be clear that minkowski spacetime remains the framework of the theory since all riemann tensor components are vanishing .",
    "to summarize : gal and tt observers unlike mtt , define the inverse transformation in the usual canonical way . on the other hand mtt and tt ,",
    "unlike gal , send the `` light cylinder '' to infinity . also , unlike tt , both mtt and gal observers measure greater circles as compared with the non - rotating observer .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to bring out the implications that , different transformations to rotating frame , have in the calculation of thomas precession .",
    "once again we must emphasize that the issue is not restricted to a simple coordinate transformation , for in this case any invariant approach would give the same result .",
    "as mentioned before it is the very definition of rotation , associated with each transformation , which makes the difference in the predicted precession .",
    "in other words , using either gal , tt or mtt , amounts to perform different experiments , since each one of these transformations implies a different definition of rotating observer .",
    "accordingly we shall now proceed to calculate the thomas precession , providing at each step the preliminary results corresponding to each one of the transformations to be used ( gal , tt , mtt ) .",
    "however , before closing this section , and for the benefit of the reader we list below the relevant components of the metric tensor in each system ( omitting primes ) .",
    "@xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31",
    "let us start by defining the vorticity vector , which as usual is given by @xmath32 where the vorticity tensor is given by @xmath33 } - \\dot{u}_{[\\alpha}u_{\\beta ] } \\label{vt}\\ ] ] and @xmath34 denotes the four - velocity vector .    next , for both mtt and tt the velocity vector of a point at rest in @xmath4 ( rotating with respect to @xmath2 ) is given by ( in cilyndrical coordinates @xmath35 ) @xmath36 or @xmath37 whereas for gal , the corresponding expressions are @xmath38 @xmath39 then a simple calculation yields @xmath40 or @xmath41 for mtt and tt , and @xmath42 @xmath43 for gal .",
    "from([omtta])([omgb ] ) the absolute value of @xmath44 is obtained at once . for mtt and tt",
    ", we get @xmath45 whereas for gal we obtain @xmath46 which is a known result @xcite .",
    "next , since @xmath47 measures the rate of rotation with respect to proper time of world lines of points at rest in @xmath4 , relative to the local compass of inertia , then @xmath48 describes the rotation of the compass of inertia ( the `` gyroscope '' ) with respect to reference particles at rest in @xmath4 ( see @xcite for detailed discussion on this point ) .",
    "therefore , after one complete revolution the change of orientation of the gyroscope as seen by the observer in @xmath4 , is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the proper time interval ( in @xmath4 ) corresponding to the period of one revolution .",
    "now , for both mtt and tt the interval of coordinate time @xmath51 corresponding to the period of one revolution is @xmath52 where the `` angular velocity '' @xmath53 in now given by ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath54 coinciding with @xmath12 for sufficiently small @xmath55 .",
    "obviously for gal the corresponding expression is @xmath56    next , from([tt ] ) and ( [ mttt])([mttfp ] ) we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 for tt and mtt respectively , whereas @xmath59 for gal .",
    "now , the relation between coordinate time interval and proper time interval ( in @xmath4 ) , for tt is @xmath60 whereas for mtt and gal we have respectively @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the expressions above it follows that @xmath63 for both tt and mtt , and @xmath64 for gal    in this later case ( gal ) , since the rotating system precesses the baseline by @xmath65 per revolution , then the precession per revolution relative to @xmath2 is given by @xmath66 \\label{pre}\\ ] ] which is the well known thomas result @xcite .",
    "the calculation for tt and mtt requires some care .",
    "thus , let us assume that at @xmath67 the orientation of the gyroscope is given by @xmath68 and , at @xmath69 by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are given by ( [ dttt])(tt ) ( or ( [ dtmtt])(mtt ) ) and ( [ dft ] ) .    then using ( [ tt ] ) and ( [ mttt])([mttfp ] ) we find for the total change of orientation of the gyroscope after one revolution as measured in @xmath2 @xmath73 \\label{tmtt}\\ ] ] for mtt , and @xmath74 \\label{ttt}\\ ] ] for tt .    before closing this section ,",
    "the following comments are in order :    observe that @xmath75 and furthermore , as it follows from ( 25)-(30 ) , the amount of proper time corresponding to a time interval @xmath76 in @xmath2 , is the same in both @xmath77 and @xmath78 frames . accordingly",
    "the change of orientation of the gyroscope for a fixed amount of proper time as measured by each of the observers ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) is the same , as it follows from ( 21 ) . specifically , up to order of @xmath79 , we have @xmath80    giving    @xmath81    of course the total change of orientation after one revolution in s , is different as calculated with @xmath77 or @xmath78 as it follows from ( 38 ) and ( 39 )",
    ".    now , for @xmath82 the situation is different .",
    "indeed , even up to order @xmath79 , @xmath83 differs from @xmath84 , as we have @xmath85    yielding    @xmath86    where the fact has been used that the proper time ( for @xmath82 ) corresponding to an interval @xmath76 in @xmath2 , is    @xmath87    which up to this order ( @xmath79 ) is the same as @xmath88 .",
    "we have seen so far that different transformations to rotating frames , implying different definitions of rotating observer , lead to different expressions for the total precession of a gyroscope on a circular orbit .",
    "now , expanding ( [ pre ] ) , ( [ tmtt ] ) and ( [ ttt ] ) in power series of @xmath55 up to quadratic terms , one obtains @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 for gal , tt and mtt respectively .",
    "thus , for sufficiently small values of @xmath55 , the differences in the predicted value of @xmath92 after one period are of the order @xmath93 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however since the effect is additive after each revolution , it may become important when observing the system for sufficiently long time .    for values of @xmath94 approaching the ultrarelativistic regime",
    "those differences are quite important after one period , as exhibited in figure 2 .",
    "we ignore about the technical feasibility to carry on an experiment allowing the detection of such differences .",
    "however , should this be possible , then a test for the correct transformation to rotating frame would be at hand .",
    "we would like to stress the fact that this problem is not only of academic interest , in view of future navigation and time transfer systems which are now being contemplated with sub - nanosecond accuracy ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "finally , it is worth remembering that thomas precession plays a fundamental role in the theory of spin - orbit coupling , and consequently it is involved in all related effects , such as zeeman effect .",
    "unfortunately all calculations we have found in literature describing this effect ( and others involving spin - orbit coupling ) , not only are perturbative and to order @xmath95 but also include other approximations which render very difficult ( to us at least ) to contrast the differences expressed through our equations ( [ rgal])-([rmtt ] ) with the experimental data .",
    "however we do believe that perhaps more competent people than we are , on this subject , could propose a gedanken ( or a real ) experiment involving spin - orbit coupling , and whose result could settle the question about the appropriate definition of a rotating observer .",
    "figure 1 . @xmath96 as function of @xmath97 , calculated with three different tranformations ( mtt , tt and galilean ) .",
    "+ figure 2 .",
    "same as figure 1 , but for larger values of @xmath98 .",
