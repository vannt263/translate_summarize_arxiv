    "in classical mechanics , one - dimensional systems ( or lattices ) consisting of mass points with some nearest neighbour interaction have a long history .",
    "a typical system is a lattice of @xmath0 particles with masses @xmath5 , and a harmonic coupling with spring constants @xmath6 leading to the hamiltonian @xmath7 such classical systems ( or variations , with an infinite number of mass points , or with various boundary conditions ) were already considered by schrdinger  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of such a system can be solved by ( numerically ) diagonalizing the interaction matrix ( the eigenvalues of which yield the normal modes of the system ) .",
    "alternatively , the system can be solved using orthogonal polynomials whose recurrence relations are derived from the equations of motion  @xcite . in that case , the normal modes are obtained from the zeros of the @xmath0th orthogonal polynomial .    one - dimensional systems with a different type of nearest neighbour interaction received a lot of attention , especially those that are still exactly solvable . among the most famous",
    ", we mention the toda system  @xcite and the calogero - sutherland - moser models  @xcite . in this context , the emphasis was shifted from physics to mathematical aspects such as integrability and the underlying algebraic structures .",
    "also the quantum versions of many of these systems or models were investigated from various points of view during the last decades .",
    "quantum calogero - moser systems for any root system were studied by olshanetsky and perelomov  @xcite ; for a review , see  @xcite . in such quantum systems , the emphasis  from the physics point of view  is on a construction of ground wave states , formulae for the excitation spectrum , a description of stationary states , etc .",
    "several other quantum systems with a nearest neighbour interaction closely related to calogero - sutherland - moser models were explored , see  @xcite to cite a few .    in the present paper",
    "we consider yet another quantum system given in equation  , consisting of a one - dimensional chain of particles with a certain nearest neighbour interaction , which is quadratic in the position operators .",
    "our emphasis is on the investigation of analytical solvability of the quantum system ( i.e.on obtaining analytically closed expressions of the spectrum of the hamiltonian and of its eigenstates , the stationary states of the system ) .",
    "in such a context , the physical significance of the interaction introduced here is less clear : it can , in a sense , be considered as a deviation from a vibrating quantum system .    to introduce our system ,",
    "let us first consider one of the most common quantum systems , consisting of a chain of harmonic oscillators coupled by some nearest neighbour interaction  @xcite . in this popular model the particles are described as identical harmonic oscillators which are moreover coupled by springs obeying hooke s law .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the system is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( fixed wall boundary conditions ) .",
    "in other words , the quantum system consists of a string or chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators , each having the same mass @xmath10 and natural frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the position and momentum operators for the @xmath3th oscillator are given by @xmath2 and @xmath12 ; more precisely @xmath2 measures the displacement of the @xmath3th mass point with respect to its equilibrium position .",
    "the last term in   represents the nearest neighbour coupling by means of `` springs '' , with a coupling strength  @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . for",
    "@xmath15 one is simply dealing with a set of identical uncoupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "we shall consider  , and the other quantum system being studied here , in the case of canonical quantization , i.e.  the @xmath2 and @xmath12 are self - adjoint operators ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) satisfying the commutation relations @xmath18 = 0,\\qquad [ { { \\hat p}}_r , { { \\hat p}}_s ] = 0 , \\qquad [ { { \\hat q}}_r , { { \\hat p}}_s ] = i\\hbar\\delta_{rs } \\qquad(r , s=1,\\ldots , n).\\ ] ] it is well known that the hamiltonian   is completely solvable ( see also next section ) .",
    "in fact , it is analytically solvable in the sense that one has an analytically closed expression for the eigenvalues of  .",
    "note that   can be rewritten in the following form ( with @xmath19 ) @xmath20 the fact that the nearest neighbour interaction is the same everywhere in the chain , thus independent of the position  @xmath3 , implies that all coefficients of @xmath21 are the same .    in the present paper , we shall study deviations of  , where the nearest neighbour interaction is not constant in the chain , but depends on  @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a more general system is assumed to be of the following form : @xmath22 the physical interpretation of such a system is not obvious .",
    "first of all , in order to have a physical meaning , the interaction matrix related to   should still be positive definite ( see next section ) .",
    "second , the interaction is in general no longer harmonic .",
    "it could be seen as a chain still consisting of identical oscillators but with a quadratic nearest neighbour interaction of the form @xmath23 .",
    "this interaction is not homogeneous in the chain but depends on the location @xmath3 in the linear system . for a more general context in which quantum systems of the form   appear as a special case ,",
    "see the notion of `` harmonic systems on general lattices '' in  @xcite in the study of entanglement in many - body systems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the spectrum of hamiltonians of the form  .",
    "such hamiltonians are always numerically solvable , i.e.  the complete spectrum can be described using the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix ( see next section ) .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to investigate those cases for which  @xmath24 is analytically solvable ( i.e.  when the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix are known in analytically closed form ) .",
    "some examples of hamiltonians for which this is the case are : @xmath25 where @xmath4 is some positive parameter .    in the following section",
    ", we shall consider   again , and describe a method to solve this hamiltonian .",
    "this method can best be formulated in terms of an interaction matrix @xmath26  @xcite , and we shall determine the conditions for @xmath26 to be analytically solvable . in particular , systems of the form   correspond to tridiagonal interaction matrices with a constant diagonal .",
    "as we shall see , this leads us to the area of discrete orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we have investigated the families of discrete orthogonal polynomials that lead to solutions .",
    "these are described in the following sections : an interaction based upon krawtchouk polynomials , on hahn polynomials , or on dual @xmath4-krawtchouk polynomials . for each of these cases , we give the corresponding hamiltonian and its solution . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we also briefly describe some interesting features of the energy levels of these hamiltonians .",
    "the hamiltonian   can be written in matrix form as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 the @xmath31 identity matrix and @xmath32 the fact that the interaction is only between nearest neighbours is reflected by the tridiagonal form of @xmath33 ( i.e.  nonzero entries only on the diagonal , the subdiagonal and the superdiagonal ) .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath33 as the `` interaction matrix ''  @xcite .",
    "let us for a while consider quantum systems described by a hamiltonian with a more general interaction matrix @xmath26 : @xmath34 in  , @xmath26 is a _ real and symmetric _ matrix .",
    "in order to be physically meaningful , @xmath35 should be a positive definite matrix  @xcite .",
    "a general method to deal with such hamiltonians was described in  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath26 is real and symmetric , the spectral theorem  @xcite implies @xmath36 where @xmath37 the entries of the diagonal matrix @xmath38 are the ( real ) eigenvalues @xmath39 of @xmath26 , in some order , and the columns of the real orthogonal matrix @xmath40 are eigenvectors of @xmath26 ( in the same order ) ; @xmath41 stands for the transpose of @xmath40 .",
    "introducing new operators ( the so - called normal coordinates and momenta ) as follows : @xmath42 the hamiltonian   reads @xmath43 by the transformation  , the new operators also satisfy the canonical commutation relations : @xmath44 = 0,\\qquad [ \\hat p_j , \\hat p_k ] = 0 , \\qquad [ \\hat q_j , \\hat p_k ] = i\\hbar\\delta_{jk } \\qquad(j , k=1,\\ldots , n).\\ ] ] in  , the values of @xmath45 are all positive since the interaction matrix @xmath35 is assumed to be positive definite .",
    "so one can introduce @xmath46 then we can write @xmath47 this expression is just like the hamiltonian of an @xmath0-dimensional non - isotropic oscillator , so we can use the commonly known method for its solution  @xcite . introducing boson operators @xmath48 these satisfy @xmath49=[a_j^+,a_k^+]=0,\\qquad [ a_j^-,a_k^+]=\\delta_{jk } , \\qquad(j , k=1,\\ldots , n)\\ ] ] and @xmath50 can be written as @xmath51 furthermore , @xmath52 = \\pm \\hbar\\omega_j \\ , a_j^\\pm \\qquad(j=1,\\ldots , n).\\ ] ] so if we assume that there is a lowest @xmath50-eigenvalue ( lowest energy ) , say for the state @xmath53 , then we have the usual @xmath0-boson fock space in which the action of @xmath50 is diagonal .",
    "the vacuum vector @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 the other ( orthogonal and normalized ) basis vectors are then defined by @xmath55 the spectrum of @xmath50 is now determined by @xmath56    this analysis is well known , and it seems to indicate that a hamiltonian of the form   with a general interaction matrix @xmath26 is exactly solvable as a quantum system .",
    "note , however , that the solution we have described involves also a _ numerical process _ , namely the determination of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath26 in   and  .",
    "we shall say that the hamiltonian @xmath50 is _ analytically solvable _ if we have an analytically closed expression for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath26 , for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "one example of an analytically solvable hamiltonian is  , with interaction matrix @xmath33 given by  . in this case , the decomposition   is determined by  @xcite @xmath57 and the eigenvalues in   by @xmath58",
    "so we have @xmath59    apparently , there are not so many examples of analytically solvable hamiltonians of the type   known in the literature .",
    "one paper dealing with this problem ( and closely related ones ) is  @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "some examples of analytically solvable hamiltonians are given .    in the current paper , we present some new examples . since we are studying hamiltonians of the form  , we are dealing with tridiagonal interaction matrices @xmath26 with constant entries on the diagonal . for tridiagonal matrices , an explicit spectral decomposition   can be found by relating these matrices to jacobi matrices of discrete orthogonal polynomials .",
    "so it is natural to look for new examples in that area .",
    "we shall first describe the example of `` krawtchouk interaction '' , and then indicate how to find other examples .",
    "in this section , let us first collect some ( known ) properties of krawtchouk polynomials , and then use these to describe the spectrum of a hamiltonian with a krawtchouk interaction term .",
    "for a list of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials , see  @xcite or  @xcite .      for a fixed positive integer parameter @xmath60 and a real parameter @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the krawtchouk polynomial of degree @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) in the variable @xmath65 is defined by  @xcite @xmath66 herein , @xmath67 is the usual gauss hypergeometric series  @xcite @xmath68 in  , the series is terminating because one of the numerator parameters is a negative integer .",
    "note that in   we use the notation of the raising factorial , which can also be rewritten by means of a ( generalized ) binomial coefficient : @xmath69 the krawtchouk polynomials satisfy a discrete orthogonality relation of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a weight function in @xmath65 and @xmath72 is a function depending on @xmath63 : @xmath73 recall that the recurrence relation for krawtchouk polynomials is given by @xmath74 \\ ,",
    "k_i(x ) + \\ , p(n - i ) \\ , k_{i+1}(x ) .",
    "\\label{kraw_rec1}\\ ] ] for future purposes we will however be interested in an orthonormality condition , so we define the orthonormal krawtchouk polynomials by @xmath75 now we can state the following property :    [ kraw_ef ] let @xmath76 be the tridiagonal @xmath77-matrix @xmath78 where @xmath79 and let @xmath40 be the @xmath77-matrix with matrix elements @xmath80^{1/2 } \\ ; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\min(i , j ) } \\frac{\\binom{i}{k}\\binom{j}{k}}{\\binom{n}{k } } ( -\\frac{1}{p})^k,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "we have that @xmath84 by the orthogonality relations  .",
    "so @xmath85 , hence @xmath41 is the inverse of @xmath40 and thus also @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , notice that @xmath87 equation   can then be rewritten as a recurrence relation for the orthonormal krawtchouk polynomials @xmath88 : @xmath89 then we have , using @xmath90 , @xmath91 so @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "so we now have a good candidate interaction matrix @xmath76 . in order to describe systems of the form  ,",
    "however , the diagonal entries @xmath94 of @xmath76 should be constants ( i.e.  independent of @xmath63 ) .",
    "we see from   that this is the case for @xmath95 .",
    "so this leads to a new analytically solvable hamiltonian of the form  .",
    "consider a linear chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators , with a nearest neighbour interaction that is given by @xmath96 we shall refer to the interaction term as `` krawtchouk interaction '' .",
    "the purpose is to find the analytic solution for the spectrum of @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to see that this hamiltonian can be written in matrix form , like  : @xmath98 where @xmath76 is the matrix   with @xmath99 and @xmath95 .",
    "but for the matrix @xmath76 we have an explicit spectral decomposition , given in lemma  [ kraw_ef ] , and the eigenvalues of @xmath76 are given by @xmath100 . using this result , and following the general procedure described in section  [ sec2 ] , one introduces here the following quantities : @xmath101 the interaction matrix @xmath102 is positive definite if all quantities under the square root symbol are positive .",
    "since @xmath13 ( and @xmath103 ) is positive , @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) is an increasing sequence as @xmath106 increases .",
    "so this condition leads to @xmath107 , or the `` coupling strength '' should be sufficiently small .",
    "now we have :    the hamiltonian @xmath108 given by   is analytically solvable .",
    "the explicit spectrum of @xmath97 follows from  : @xmath109 where the constants @xmath110 are given by @xmath111 .",
    "finally , notice that the interaction term in   is invariant under the reflection @xmath112 .",
    "it is clear that the general procedure worked out here for the krawtchouk polynomials works in general for discrete orthogonal polynomials .",
    "so in order to find other interesting examples , one can go through the list of discrete orthogonal polynomials  @xcite and their @xmath4-analogues .",
    "the basic restriction , in order to have hamiltonians of the form  , is that the diagonal elements in the interaction matrix are constant ( for specific values of the parameters ) .",
    "an investigation of this restriction has shown that , apart from the krawtchouk polynomials with @xmath95 , there are only the following cases to be considered : the hahn polynomials with @xmath113 and the dual @xmath4-krawtchouk polynomials with @xmath114 .",
    "we shall now study these cases and the corresponding hamiltonians .",
    "hahn polynomials are again a class of discrete orthogonal polynomials @xmath115 , characterized by a positive integer parameter @xmath60 and two real parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( for orthogonality , one should have @xmath118 and @xmath119 , or @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) .",

    "note that in that case the parameter should satisfy @xmath118 or @xmath120 .",

    "* when @xmath147 ( with @xmath148 ) one finds that all @xmath149 for @xmath150 , but @xmath151 .    for these cases , it could still be interesting to consider the hamiltonian   built from the corresponding interaction matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian , however , is not of the form   as either the first or last oscillator in the chain would play a special role and give rise to an extra term ( either in @xmath152 or else in @xmath153 ) ; so the chain would no longer consist of identical oscillators , but have one of them different from the others .",

    "consider a linear chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators with a nearest neighbour interaction given by @xmath154 the interaction term to be referred to as the `` hahn interaction '' , and where @xmath116 is some parameter with @xmath118 or @xmath155 ( guaranteeing that the expression under the square root is positive ) .",

    "this leads again to a hamiltonian of the type  .",

    "* the hamiltonian with krawtchouk interaction   or with hahn interaction  , which have the same spectrum and where the values @xmath110 are given by  , plotted in figure  1(b ) .",
    "* the hamiltonian with @xmath4-krawtchouk interaction   where @xmath192 , for which the @xmath110 are given by  , plotted in figure  1(c ) . * the same hamiltonian   but with @xmath193 , for which the @xmath110 are also given by  , plotted in figure  1(d ) .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath4 are appropriately chosen ( see the figure caption for actual values ) in order to illustrate the typical energy level spacing properties for each case .",
    "for a hamiltonian with constant nearest neighbour interaction like   or  , the levels are wider apart in the middle of the spectrum , and closer to each other near the top and the bottom of the spectrum , see figure  1(a ) .",
    "the property is known , and was e.g.  also observed in  @xcite . for a hamiltonian with a krawtchouk interaction or a hahn interaction like   or  ,",
    "the energy level spacing decreases as the energy increases , a phenomenon also typical for molecular spectra , see figure  1(b ) .",
    "finally , for a hamiltonian with a @xmath4-krawtchouk interaction like  , the energy level properties depend on whether @xmath195 or @xmath192 . for @xmath192 ,",
    "one observes just the opposite of a constant nearest neighbour interaction : the energy level spacing is small near the middle of the spectrum , and larger near the top and bottom of the spectrum ( but they are wider apart near the top than near the bottom ) , see figure  1(c ) . for @xmath195 , the levels behave similarly :",
    "the energy level spacing is small near the middle of the spectrum , and larger near the top and bottom of the spectrum , but now they are wider apart near the bottom than near the top , see figure  1(d ) .",
    "it should be noted that for the cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) the order of the levels from bottom to top correspond to the states @xmath198 , @xmath206 , @xmath200 @xmath207 in this order , whereas for ( d ) it is just the opposite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the sequence @xmath110 ( @xmath105 ) is an increasing sequence in the cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , but a decreasing sequence in the case ( d ) ( see the remark following eq .  ) .    to conclude , we have presented a number of hamiltonians for a quantum system consisting of a linear chain of identical oscillators with a nearest neighbour interaction term depending on the position in the chain , in general given by  .",

    "the connection between the interaction matrix of the matrix expression of the hamiltonian and jacobi matrices of discrete orthogonal polynomials has led to new analytically solvable hamiltonians , with interesting spectral properties .",
    "our original interest in hamiltonians with a nearest neighbour interaction of the form   stems from the fact that this hamiltonian can also be quantized in an alternative way , namely as a wigner quantum system  @xcite , leading in particular to finite spectra and non - commutative coordinates  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to investigate when hamiltonians with a general interaction matrix , of the form  , can still be solved as a wigner quantum system , and investigate the properties of such a solution .",
    "we hope to report on that topic in the near future .",

    "<S> we consider quantum systems consisting of a linear chain of @xmath0 harmonic oscillators coupled by a nearest neighbour interaction of the form @xmath1 ( @xmath2 refers to the position of the @xmath3th oscillator ) . in principle , such systems are always numerically solvable and involve the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix . in this paper , we investigate when such a system is analytically solvable , i.e.when the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the interaction matrix have analytically closed expressions . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case when the interaction matrix coincides with the jacobi matrix of a system of discrete orthogonal polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> our study of possible systems leads to three new analytically solvable hamiltonians : with a krawtchouk interaction , a hahn interaction or a @xmath4-krawtchouk interaction . for each of these cases , we give the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( in analytic form ) and discuss some typical properties of the spectra .    </S>",
