    "a significant fraction of extragalactic jets show some degree of bending  from slightly curved jets up to a complete turn - around of almost 180@xmath0 . recently , in their large study of jet kinematics of radio - loud active galactic nuclei , @xcite measured vector velocities for 60 bright jet features ( also called components ) .",
    "they found that approximately a third of these components show a significant non - radial motion , i.e. the direction of their velocity vector differs by at least @xmath1 from the mean structural position angle of the jet .",
    "if these observed velocities trace the underlying jet flow , their result indicates that bends in jet direction are very common .    for core - dominated radio sources with high optical polarization ,",
    "there is a well - known bimodal distribution of the angles between jets in parsec and kiloparsec scales , with a main peak of misalignment angles around 0@xmath0 and a secondary peak around 90@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , a large - angle misalignment exceeding 120@xmath0 is rare @xcite . up to today , the largest observed @xmath2p.a .",
    "is 177@xmath0 in the gamma - ray blazar , which shows a jet bending almost directly across our line of sight @xcite .",
    "since core - dominated radio sources have jets oriented close to our line of sight , all intrinsic variations in the jet trajectories are exaggerated in projection  often to a large degree .",
    "this implies that rather small intrinsic bends can manifest themselves as large - angle misalignments between the jet axes observed on parsec and kiloparsec scales , or as high as @xmath3 turns in the vlbi images .",
    "observations of relativistic jets in parsec scales provide evidence that agn jets can exhibit `` wiggling '' structures ( e.g. , @xcite ; , @xcite ; , @xcite ; , @xcite ) reminiscent of helically twisted patterns .",
    "it has been proposed that doppler boosting together with parsec - scale jets traveling in helical paths could explain the excess of sources showing 90@xmath0 misalignment angle between pc and kpc scale jets without invoking an uncomfortable 90@xmath0 intrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "as the number of sources showing apparently helical structures has grown , the helical jet models have become increasingly popular also as an explanation for the ( quasi)periodic flux variations in agn @xcite . however , the mechanism producing an apparently helical shape of the jet is unclear  as are the explanations also for more modest observed bends .",
    "the `` corkscrew '' structure of the jet in the well - known galactic source is successfully explained by ballistic motion of material ejected from a precessing jet nozzle @xcite , and a similar model has been suggested also for several extragalactic jets showing `` wiggling '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; , @xcite ; , @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "the jet precession is either due to the lense - thirring effect in a case of misalignment between the angular momenta of accretion disk and a kerr black hole ( see @xcite and references therein ) , or due to a binary black hole system where a secondary black hole tidally induces the precession .",
    "contrary to the above - mentioned cases , @xcite report that although the powerful radio source exhibits a jet ridge line highly reminiscent of that in , it is most likely due to streaming instead of ballistic motion . streaming helical motion",
    "arises naturally from spatial stability analysis of relativistic jets , since the jets are unstable against growing kelvin - helmholtz normal modes @xcite .",
    "provided there is a suitable perturbation mechanism present in the inner part of the jet , the distortion waves propagating down the jet can displace the whole jet ( helical fundamental mode ) or produce helically twisted patterns on the jet surface ( fluting modes ) . if the jet carries a large scale electric current ( so - called poynting flux dominated jets ) , it is in addition unstable against magnetic kink instability , which could also produce observed `` wiggling '' structures @xcite .",
    "not all jets with observed bends exhibit `` wiggling '' structure , and many of the observed changes in the jet direction can be explained without invoking helical motions .",
    "proposed explanations for curving jets include ram pressure due to winds in the intracluster medium , a density gradient in a transition to the intergalactic medium and deflections by massive clouds in the interstellar medium .",
    "most likely , different mechanisms work in different sources",
    ". it would be valuable to be able to reliably identify the reason for bending in individual sources , since the observed properties of the bend ",
    "correctly interpreted  can constrain several physical parameters of the jet and the external medium ( see e.g. @xcite for the case of k - h instabilities ) .    in this paper , we present very long baseline array ( vlba ) images from a dedicated multi - frequency observation and from the vlba 2 cm survey @xcite showing that ( ) , a radio - loud quasar at moderately high redshift of 2.427 , has a parsec - scale jet , which appears to bend _ over _ 180@xmath0 on the plane of the sky , being  to our knowledge  the largest ever observed change in the position angle of an astrophysical jet ( other sources showing very pronounced changes in the jet direction include e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and ( i. agudo et al . , in preparation ) ) . in vla images ,",
    "is a compact source , showing no extended emission on arcsecond scales @xcite .",
    "both 5 ghz @xcite and 15 ghz @xcite vlba observations reveal a core - dominated source with a short , slightly bending jet .",
    "originally , @xcite identified as a candidate gigahertz - peaked spectrum source ( gps ) having a slightly inverted spectrum up to 8 - 10 ghz in the intermediate - to - quiescent state and a clearly inverted spectrum ( @xmath4 ) during outbursts . the high turnover frequency reported in @xcite",
    "even puts in the class of high frequency peakers ( hfp ) .",
    "although @xcite have recently classified the source as a flat spectrum radio source having a convex spectrum only during outbursts , the simultaneous continuum spectra from ratan-600 ( * ? ?",
    "* s. trushkin , private communication ) do show a convex shape also in the intermediate - to - quiescent state , albeit with a little lower peak frequency .",
    "the source is variable at radio frequencies showing a factor of @xmath5 variations in cm - wavelength flux curves with characteristic time scale of @xmath6 years ( see figure  [ umrao ] ) .",
    "the last strong outburst started around 1998 and peaked in late 2002 and in early 2004 at 14.5 and 8 ghz , respectively .",
    "this indicates that both , our multi - frequency observations in 2001 and 15 ghz vlba monitoring during 1995 - 2004 , caught the source during a major flare .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the multi - frequency vlba data demonstrating the 210@xmath0 bend of the jet , together with a space - vlbi observation from the halca satellite , are presented in   2 . in   3 , we present a kinematic analysis , derived from over eight years of the vlba 2 cm survey monitoring data at 15 ghz , indicating non - ballistic motion of the jet components . also , changes in @xmath7 and in the apparent half - opening angle of the jet are investigated . in   4 , possible reasons for observed bending are discussed and a helical streaming model explaining the observed structure is presented .",

    "global fringe fitting was performed , and the delay difference between right- and left - hand systems was removed ( for the purpose of future polarization studies ) .",
    "bandpass corrections were determined and applied before averaging across the channels , after which the data were imported into difmap .    in difmap the data were first phase self - calibrated using a point source model and then averaged in time .",

    "we have checked the absolute flux calibration by comparing the extrapolated zero baseline flux density of our compact calibrator source at 5 , 8.4 , and 15 ghz to the single - dish measurements made at university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) , and at 22 and 43 ghz to the fluxes from metshovi radio observatory s quasar monitoring program at 22 and 37 ghz , respectively @xcite .",
    "the flux densities agree to 5% at 8.4 , 15 , 22 and 37/43 ghz , and to 8% at 5 ghz , which is better than the expected nominal accuracy of 10% for the _ a priori _ amplitude calibration .",
    "being unable to make a flux check for the 2.3 ghz data , we conservatively estimate it to have an absolute flux calibration accurate to 10% .    in order to estimate the parameters of the emission regions in the jet , we model - fitted to the self - calibrated ( _ u , v _ ) data in difmap .",

    "its weight was increased to 10 to persuade the fitting algorithm to take better account of the long space baselines .",
    "the dynamic range of the resulting image is rather small .",
    "this is due to a component that had a strong effect only to a single baseline between arecibo and green bank . because the ( _ u , v _ ) coverage is very limited , all attempts to model this component diverged . by manually changing the model to follow the visibility amplitudes in this scan",
    ", we estimate that the position of this component is about 7 mas at a pa of 100@xmath17 .",

    "the multi - frequency images strikingly reveal a jet which gradually bends @xmath18 with its structural p.a . turning clockwise from -27@xmath0 at 43 ghz to + 123@xmath0 at 2.3 ghz .",
    "we identify the bright and the most compact model component lying in the south - east end of the jet in the 1543 ghz images as the core , and mark it with a letter `` c '' .",
    "the identification is confirmed by a self - absorbed spectrum of the component , as will be shown later . between about 0.4 - 1.0 mas from the core , the jet turns over @xmath19 , which is visible in 1543 ghz images , and in the image taken at 8.4 ghz , the jet direction continues to turn clockwise @xmath20 at about 3.5 mas from the core .",
    "there is also evident bending in the 5 and 8.4 ghz images : a curve of @xmath21 takes place at about 6 mas south of the core .",
    "it is not totally clear , whether the trajectory of the jet is composed of a few distinct bends or whether it is a continuous helix .",
    "however , the gradual clockwise turn and the apparent spiral - like appearance of the jet in the multi - frequency images are highly reminiscent of a helical trajectory .",
    "also , it seems unlikely that the jet goes through at least three consecutive deflections with all of them having the same sense of rotation in the plane of the sky .",
    "the 5 ghz space - vlbi image of from 1998 may 28 , i.e. three years before the multi - frequency vlba observations , shows a rather compact core - jet structure with an extended emission to north - west ( figure  [ halcamap ] ) .",
    "the jet takes then a sharp @xmath19 bend to south - west within about 1 mas from the core .",
    "this 5 ghz image shows a very similar curved structure near the core that can be seen in our ground - based 15 ghz image with matching resolution .",
    "hence , the observed large - angle bending between the images taken at different frequencies can not be attributed to frequency dependent opacity effects .",
    "is rather compact at all frequencies with a maximum jet extent of approximately 15 mas corresponding to @xmath22 pc at the source distance .",

    "figure  [ spectrum ] shows the 843 ghz spectra of these two components . at 2.3 and 5 ghz",
    "the angular resolution is too poor to separate the core from i5 , and hence , corresponding flux values are omitted in the figure .",
    "the core has a synchrotron peak frequency of @xmath24 ghz , while the newly ejected component i5 shows an optically thin synchrotron spectrum with a spectral index @xmath25 and a peak frequency below 8 ghz .",
    "the component i5 is brighter than the core at every frequency except at 22 ghz , where almost equal flux densities are measured .",
    "an optically thick spectrum of the core at frequencies below 22 ghz indicates that i5 is brighter than the core also at 2.3 and 5 ghz , although the spectra can not be measured at those frequencies .",

    "moreover , the components are found to be located close - by along the curved inner part of the jet , in many cases separated from each other by considerably less than one beam size .",
    "special care had to be taken to find a model of this complicated structure in a consistent way for all epochs .",
    "a crucial question raised by the apparent helical shape of the jet in figure  [ mutka ] is , whether it represents streaming motion or whether the helix is due to a precessing jet nozzle ejecting material that moves along ballistic trajectories .",

    "we restrict our analysis to a full kinematical model for the inner 2 mas of the jet , since beyond that distance a fully self - consistent model could not be established due to the lower surface brightness and high complexity in the outer region .",
    "figure  [ trajectories ] shows the trajectories of the six compact components ( i1-i6 ) which we have identified in the inner 2 mas of the jet . the components travel towards south - west and their trajectories do not extrapolate back to the core implying that the components travel along a curved path , and the jet is non - ballistic .",
    "the components fade below the detection limit within @xmath27 mas from the core , and we can not follow them further .    we present the flux density evolution of the six inner - jet components in figure  [ fluxes ] .",
    "the overall picture is that the fluxes decrease as the components move forward along their path .",
    "they reach about 515 mjy by the time they have traveled to a distance of @xmath28 mas from the core , after which they are not seen anymore .",
    "the knot i3 is the brightest component of the source at the first two epochs , and its flux density evolution matches well with the strong 1993 flare visible in the 14.5 ghz umrao flux density curve ( see figure  [ umrao ] ) .",
    "the ejections of the components i1 and i2 ( see table  [ speeds ] ) take place during the rising phase of the 1993 outburst , and the component i3 is ejected just before the outburst reaches its maximum .",
    "the core has a steadily rising flux density until 2001.20 , when the flux suddenly drops and two new components , i4 and i5 , appear . at the next two epochs ,",
    "the core flux increases again and at the last epoch ( 2004.27 ) there is a drop accompanied by an appearance of a new component , i6 .",
    "the brightening of the core during our monitoring and ejections of components i4 , i5 , and i6 correspond to a strong total flux density flare peaking in late 2002 at 14.5 ghz ( again , see the total flux density curve in figure  [ umrao ] ) .",
    "the above - mentioned flux density evolution of the components is self - consistent and it is well in accordance with the general behavior of flat - spectrum radio quasars during strong total flux density flares @xcite , i.e. a compact vlbi core is mostly responsible for the rising part of the observed flares in single - dish flux curves , and a new component appears into the jet during or after the flare peaks accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the core flux density . the fact that the overall flux density evolution of the identified components in seems to obey the common behavior identified for a number of other sources supports our kinematical model .",
    "an intriguing detail is the consecutive ejection of , not one , but three new components in connection with a single , strong total flux density flare .",

    "another approach to this problem is to try to estimate the real @xmath36 uncertainties of the component positions by applying a method described by @xcite .",
    "they estimated the uncertainties of the fitted parameters of their proper motion models by using the variance about the best - fit model , and as a by - product they obtained an upper bound estimate of the component position uncertainty .",
    "since the relative @xmath35 values divided by the degrees of freedom are significantly less than unity for components i2 and i5 ( the situation of component i4 is discussed later ) , we suspect that the real @xmath36 positional uncertainties are in fact smaller than @xmath37 of the beam size .",

    "one possible explanation is that the proper motion for i4 is faster than indicated by the best - fit line in figure  [ motion ] , and it is not actually present in the jet in 1999.55 .",
    "a second possibility is that i4 is a trailing shock released in the wake of the primary superluminal component i3 instead of being ejected from the core @xcite .",
    "this alternative is not a very plausible one , since according to @xcite trailing shocks should have a significantly slower speed than the main perturbance .",
    "a third possible explanation for the non - detection of i4 in 1999.55 is that either i4 and the core or i4 and i3 are so close to one another in 1999.55 that they do not appear as separate components in our data .    ]    as discussed above , we can not firmly establish that component i3 accelerates along the jet ridge line , although it seems probable .",
    "however , also the other components ( apart from i4 , which itself might show acceleration ) appear to be systematically faster , the farther away from the core they lie . we have averaged the velocities of the individual components over traveled distance bins of 1.0 and 0.5 mas . in averaging ,",
    "we have taken into account the standard errors given in table  [ speeds ] and the fact that for a given component in a given bin , the weight has to be decreased , if the first or the last observation of the component falls into that bin .",
    "this is because naturally we do not have any knowledge about the component speed before or after our observations . for component",
    "i3 we have used the quadratic fit instead of the linear , since it much better describes the data .",
    "the binned velocities are presented in figure  [ beta ] , which suggests that there is acceleration along the jet ridge line . when the data is divided in four bins , the first bin ( 00.5 mas )",
    "has an average component velocity of @xmath87 , while the rest of the bins ( 0.52.0 mas ) have significantly higher velocities , the maximum being @xmath88 for the bin covering 1.01.5 mas . for the division in two bins ,",
    "the change is from @xmath89 in the first bin to @xmath88 in the second .",
    "the acceleration takes place in the first strong bend of the jet , which seems very natural since the apparent velocity depends on the angle between the local direction of the jet flow and our line of sight . the acceleration in figure  [ beta ]",
    "can alternatively be explained with the component speed changing as a function of ejection epoch  a new component ( i5 ) being slower than the old ones ( i1i2 ) .",
    "this , however , does not explain the likely acceleration of i3 .",
    "thus we regard the change in @xmath7 along the jet ridge line as probable although more data is needed for conclusive evidence .",
    "@xcite parameterized the @xmath90 vlba 2 cm survey data of by fitting gaussian components to the brightest features of each epoch in the image plane and derived a speed of @xmath91 , which is much lower than our estimates .",
    "basically , their approach traces the component i3 over the time when its proper motion was slow ( see figure  [ motion ] ) , and due to the curved path of i3 , the speed measured from the changes in its radial distance from the core is also lower than its true angular velocity .",
    "a linear least - squares - fit to the radial distances of i3 in our data over the epochs @xmath90 yields @xmath92 , which agrees with the speed given in @xcite within the errors .",
    "the angle between the local jet direction and our line of sight affects also the apparent opening angle of the jet .",
    "assuming that the jet has a conical structure and a filling factor of unity , we have estimated the local value of the apparent half - opening angle for component @xmath93 as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the distance of the component @xmath93 from the core measured along the jet ridge line , and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 being the size of the elliptical component projected on the line perpendicular to the jet and @xmath98 being the normal distance of the component from the jet ridge line .     of the components as a function of projected distance along the jet .",
    "the symbols for components i1-i6 are the same as used in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "_ stars _ correspond to components of the 22 ghz data and _ asterisks _ are for the 43 ghz components .",

    "figure  [ psi ] shows the apparent half - opening angle for components i1-i6 from 15 ghz data and for unnamed components from 22 and 43 ghz data as a function of traveled distance along the ridge line .",
    "the components with zero axial ratio have been excluded from the figure .",
    "naturally , @xmath99 is very uncertain for a single component , but figure  [ psi ] clearly shows that there is a change in the average @xmath99 between the first @xmath100 mas and @xmath101 mas , and the change seems to correspond to the first large bend in the jet . within the first 0.5 mas ,",
    "the average apparent half - opening angle is @xmath102 and further down the jet it decreases to @xmath103 .",
    "a natural explanation for this effect is that the viewing angle @xmath104 increases in the first apparent bend , since @xmath105 if @xmath104 and the intrinsic half - opening angle @xmath106 are both small .",
    "there is a caveat , though .",
    "namely , the large value of @xmath99 near the core could be due to a resolution effect : if the positional uncertainties for the components near the core were @xmath15 of the beam size , @xmath107 of these components could be @xmath108 mas at 15 ghz merely due to the scatter , and this would result in @xmath109",
    ". however , there are two reasons , why we think the observed change in @xmath99 is a true effect and due to a changing @xmath104 .",
    "first , the model - fit components from 22 and 43 ghz data show similar values for @xmath99 near the core as the components from 15 ghz data , although they have a factor of 1.52 smaller positional errors .",
    "secondly , the components near the core are bright , having fluxes comparable to the core , which makes their positional uncertainties smaller than the adopted @xmath15 of the beam size ( see also the previous section for a discussion about the positional uncertainties ) . according to @xcite bright ( flux of the knot @xmath110 rms noise level ) and compact ( size @xmath111 mas ) features in the jet have positional uncertainties @xmath112 mas at 7 mm .",
    "thus we regard the observed change in @xmath99 as a genuine effect .",
    "the @xmath7 of the jet seems to increase after @xmath113 mas from the core ( see figure  [ beta ] ) while the @xmath99 decreases .",
    "this can be understood , if the angle between local jet direction and our line of sight within the first @xmath100 mas is smaller than the angle @xmath114 , which maximizes @xmath7 .",
    "after 0.5 mas @xmath104 increases towards the maximal superluminal angle increasing @xmath7 and decreasing @xmath99 . assuming that the largest velocity in figure  [ beta ] , @xmath115 , is close to the maximum apparent velocity",
    "( we do not consider the velocity of i1 , 25.1@xmath116 , very reliable since it is based on only two data points , and hence , we do not use it in our estimation of the maximum @xmath7 ) , we can estimate that the jet lorentz factor @xmath117 .",
    "now , if we assume a constant lorentz factor @xmath118 , we can fit for the values of the viewing angle and the intrinsic jet half - opening angle giving the observed superluminal speeds and half - opening angles before and after the bend . for @xmath119 , @xmath120 within the first 0.5 mas from the core and @xmath121 , @xmath122 after the bend , we obtain the following best - fit values : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . according to this result , the jet bends away from our line sight by @xmath126 after the first 0.5 mas from the core .",
    "naturally , it is possible that the components exhibit also real acceleration along the jet in addition to the apparent acceleration due to the projection effect . unfortunately , the observations do not allow us to decide between these cases .",
    "applying occam s razor , we consider a constant jet speed in the following discussion .",
    "in this section we discuss the mechanisms capable of producing the curved structure of . in principle , there are several possible scenarios for the observed bending in relativistic jets , but we can rule out some of them in this particular case on the grounds of our analyzed data .",
    "projection effects play an important role in this case making the intrinsic bending angle much less than the observed one .",
    "if the angle between the jet and our line of sight is as small as the analysis in the previous section indicates , it is possible that , for example , within 0.5 - 1.0 mas from the core where the apparent bend is @xmath127 , the intrinsic bending angle is only @xmath128 degrees .",
    "this implies that formation of internal shocks in the bend , and their possibly destructive effect to the collimation of the jet , is not of great concern here .",
    "@xcite calculate an upper limit to the bending angle of a jet in order not to create a shock wave at the end of the curvature .",
    "their result for relativistic jets is @xmath129 , which leaves our estimated intrinsic bending angle for well within the limits .",
    "therefore , we do not consider internal shocks formed by bending to restrict the possible explanations for the curvature in this source .",
    "one of the scenarios we can rule out , is a precessing jet where the components ejected at different times to different directions move ballistically , and form an apparently curved locus .",
    "such models have been used to describe oscillating nozzles observed in some bl lac sources @xcite . in the case of , we can reject the precessing ballistic jet hypothesis , since the individual components do not follow ballistic trajectories , but rather exhibit streaming motion along a curved path ( see  [ sec_traj ] ) .",
    "however , precession of the jet inlet may still be behind the observed structure if it serves as an initial perturbation driving a helical kelvin - helmholtz normal mode ( see  [ model ] ) .",
    "@xcite explained the large misalignment between the pc and kpc scale jets of with a scenario where the jet is bent after it departs the host galaxy , either by a density gradient in the transition region or by ram pressure due to the winds in the intracluster medium . in the bending",
    "starts within 0.5 mas from the core , and because @xmath130 degrees for the inner part of the jet ( the error range here refers to an uncertainty introduced by errors in @xmath131 ; see ",
    "[ velocities ] and [ angles ] ) , the corresponding deprojected distance is smaller than 0.8 kpc .",
    "the whole bending visible in figure  [ mutka ] takes place within about 15 mas from the core .",
    "given the viewing angles estimated in   [ angles ] , it is fair to say that the deprojected length of the jet is  probably significantly ",
    "less than @xmath132 kpc , and the whole observed bending takes place within that distance from the core .",
    "there are no observations of the host galaxy of , but the deprojected lengths estimated above can be compared with typical scalelengths of the elliptical hosts of radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) , which are reported by several groups . in their near - infrared study , @xcite found low - redshift @xmath133 rlq hosts to have very large half - light scalelengths @xmath134 ; from 14.0 to 106.8 kpc with an average of @xmath135 kpc .",
    "other studies have yielded smaller values : e.g. @xcite used _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 data to study hosts of 17 quasars at @xmath136 finding @xmath137 kpc for rlqs , and @xcite reported @xmath138 kpc for 12 flat spectrum radio quasars up to @xmath139 in their near - infrared study . in the framework of hierarchical models of galaxy formation",
    ", the hosts of quasars at high redshift are also expected to be more compact than their low - redshift counterparts . @xcite",
    "have recently managed to resolve a quasar host at @xmath140 and they report an effective radius of @xmath141 kpc . as the deprojected distance @xmath142 kpc indicates , the bending of the jet in starts well within the host galaxy , and the typical scalelengths listed above suggest that most of the curved jet is located within the host , although it is possible that part of it lies in the outskirts of the host galaxy being susceptible to the density gradient in the transition region .",
    "however , the bending clearly starts inside the galaxy , and thus requires some other cause .",
    "a collision inside the host galaxy , between the jet and a cloud of interstellar matter , can change the direction of the flow .",
    "for example , @xcite have found component c4 in to change its trajectory by @xmath143 in the plane of the sky , and they suggest this to be due to a collimation event resulting from an interaction of the component with the boundary between the outflow and the interstellar medium . however , the mere fact that the observed @xmath2p.a . is larger than 180@xmath0 in our case constrains the collision scenario since it excludes the situations where the jet is bent by a single deflection , e.g. from a single massive cloud . in principle , the observed structure may be due to several consecutive deflections from a number of clouds , but , as already mentioned in  [ structure ] , this would require there to be at least three successive deflections having the same sense of rotation in the plane of the sky .",
    "this is unlikely , although not impossible .",
    "future observations aimed at detecting emission from the jet beyond 20 mas will be very interesting , since they could tell whether the bending continues in the larger scale or not .",
    "if curvature with the same sense of rotation as within 15 mas is observed also in the larger scale , the scenario with multiple deflections from ism clouds seems highly unlikely .",
    "relativistic jets are known to be kelvin - helmholtz unstable , and they can naturally develop helical distortions if an initial seed perturbation is present at the jet origin .",
    "the helical k - h fundamental mode is capable of displacing the entire jet and consequently producing large scale helical structures where the plasma streams along a curved path @xcite .",
    "the initial perturbations can have a random spectrum , and be due to for example jet - cloud interaction , or they can originate from a periodic variation in the flow direction of the central engine ( precession or orbital motion ) .",
    "these perturbations can trigger pinch , helical or higher order normal modes propagating down the jet , and the appearance of this structure depends on the original wave frequency and amplitude , as well as subsequent growth or damping of the modes .",
    "since the individual components in do not follow ballistic trajectories , but rather seem to stream along a helical path , we consider a helical k - h fundamental mode to be a possible explanation for the curious appearance of this source . for simplicity , in the following discussion we limit ourselves to a purely hydrodynamical case and do not consider the effect of magnetic fields for the growth of k - h modes , nor discuss the current - driven instabilities , which can produce helical patterns in poynting - flux dominated jets @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the jet in already suggests some properties of the wave .",
    "the fact that components are observed to follow a nearly stationary helix implies that the wave frequency of the helical twist , @xmath144 , is much below the `` resonant '' ( or maximally unstable ) frequency @xmath145 , which corresponds to the frequency of the fastest growing helical wave @xcite .",
    "such a low frequency , long wavelength helical twist suggests that the wave is driven by a periodic perturbation at the jet base .",
    "if the central source induced white - noise - like perturbations , we would expect to see structures corresponding to the fastest growing frequency , i.e. @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "if isothermal jet expansion without gradients in the jet speed or in the ratio of the jet and external medium sound speeds is assumed , the wave speed , @xmath146 ( in units of @xmath116 ) , in the low frequency limit remains constant as the jet expands @xcite .",
    "since the intrinsic wavelength , @xmath147 , for a given @xmath144 varies proportional to the the wave speed , it can be also assumed to remain constant along the jet ( as long as @xmath148 ) . applying this assumption ,",
    "we have fitted a simple helical twist to the observed positions of the vlbi components .",
    "the helical twist is specified in cylindrical coordinates with @xmath149 along the axis of helix , by an amplitude @xmath150 in the radial direction , and by a phase angle @xmath151 given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the handedness of the helix ( @xmath154 for right - handed and @xmath155 for left - handed ) , and @xmath156 . with constant @xmath147 ,",

    "<S> we report the discovery of an extremely curved jet in the radio - loud quasar . </S>",
    "<S> multi - frequency very long baseline array ( vlba ) images show a bending jet making a turn - around of 210 degrees in the plane of the sky , which is , to our knowledge , the largest ever observed change in the position angle of an astrophysical jet . </S>",
    "<S> images taken at six different frequencies , from 2.3 to 43 ghz , reveal a spiral - like trajectory , which is likely a sign of an intrinsic helical geometry . </S>",
    "<S> a space - vlbi image , taken with the halca satellite at 5 ghz and having comparable resolution to our ground - based 15 ghz data , confirms that the bend is a frequency - independent structure . </S>",
    "<S> vlba monitoring data at 15 ghz , covering eight years of observations , show knots in the jet clearly deviating from ballistic motion , which suggests that the bending may be caused by a growing helical kelvin - helmholtz normal mode . </S>",
    "<S> the jet appearance suggests a helical wave at a frequency well below the `` resonant '' frequency of the jet , which indicates that the wave is driven by a periodic perturbation at the base of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the observed structure in the source with a helical twist , and we find that a simple isothermal model with a constant wave speed and wavelength gives a good fit . </S>",
    "<S> the measured apparent velocities indicate some degree of acceleration along the jet , which together with an observed change in the apparent half - opening angle of the jet allow us to estimate the changes in the angle between the local jet direction and our line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the jet in is distorted by a helical kelvin - helmholtz normal mode externally driven into the jet ( e.g. by precession ) , and that our line of sight falls within the opening angle of the helix cone . </S>"
