    "frequency - shift keying ( fsk ) is a modulation format that is well - known and well - studied in the communications literature @xcite .",
    "fsk is an attractive transmission scheme due to its high energy efficiency and suitability for noncoherent communications . in unknown channel conditions ,",
    "energy detection can be employed to detect the fsk signals .",
    "indeed , the analysis of fsk modulation dates back to 1960s ( see e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown in @xcite that unless the channel conditions are perfectly known at the receiver , signals that have very high peak - to - average power ratio is required to achieve the capacity in the low snr regime .",
    "this has initiated work on peaky signaling .",
    "luo and mdard @xcite have shown that fsk with small duty cycle can achieve rates of the order of capacity in ultrawideband systems with limits on bandwidth and peak power . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have studied the error performance of peaky fsk signaling over multipath fading channels by obtaining upper and lower bounds on the error probability . in @xcite , on - off frequency - shift keying ( oofsk ) is defined as fsk overlaid on on - off keying , and its capacity and energy efficiency is analyzed .",
    "note that oofsk can be seen as joint pulse position modulation ( ppm ) and fsk . in this",
    "signaling , peakedness is introduced in both time and frequency .",
    "the error performance of oofsk signaling when the transmitter and receiver are each equipped with a single antenna is recently studied in @xcite .",
    "one of the important techniques to improve the performance in wireless communications is to use multiple antennas to achieve diversity gain .",
    "considerable amount of work has been done on multiple reception channels . in @xcite , it is shown for binary and @xmath0-ary signaling over rician fading channels that increasing the number of reception channels can improve the error performance significantly . by finding the probability distribution function of the instantaneous snr in flat fading multi - reception channels and substituting it into the probability of error expressions of pam , psk and qam over awgn channel , the authors in @xcite obtained expressions for the average probability of error of multi - reception fading channels . in @xcite , the probability of error of bpsk over rician fading multi - reception channels is given and extensions to other modulation techniques are discussed . in @xcite , average symbol error rate of selection diversity of @xmath0-ary fsk",
    "modulated signal transmitted over fading channels is studied .    in this paper , the error performance of oofsk over multiple reception rician fading channels is studied . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , the system model is presented . in section [ sec : coherent ] , the error performance in coherent fading channels is studied . in section [ sec : noncoherent ] , we investigate the error performance in noncoherent rician fading channels .",
    "we assume that oofsk modulation is employed at the transmitter to send the information . in oofsk modulation ,",
    "the transmitted signal during the symbol interval @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the frequency in radians per second and phase , respectively , of the signal @xmath5 when @xmath6 . note that we have @xmath0 fsk signals and a zero signal denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the frequencies of the fsk signals are chosen so that the signals are orthogonal . it is assumed that an fsk signal @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is transmitted with a probability of @xmath8 while @xmath7 is transmitted with a probability of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the duty cycle of transmission . with these definitions",
    ", it is easily seen that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the average and peak powers , respectively , of the modulation technique .",
    "the receiver is equipped with @xmath13 antennas that enable the multiple reception of the transmitted signal . if , without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath14 is the transmitted signal , the received signal at the @xmath15 antenna is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fading coefficient at the @xmath15 reception channel and @xmath18 is a white gaussian noise with single - sided spectral density of @xmath19 .",
    "it is assumed that the additive gaussian noise components at different antennas are independent .",
    "furthermore , the received signal model ( [ eq : receivedsignal ] ) presumes that the fading is frequency - flat and slow enough so that the fading coefficient stays constant over one symbol duration .    following each antenna",
    ", there is a bank of @xmath0 correlators , each correlating the received signal with one of the orthogonal frequencies .",
    "the output of the @xmath20 correlator employed after the @xmath15 antenna is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with zero - mean and a variance of @xmath23 and for notational convenience , we have defined @xmath24 . since the frequencies are orthogonal and the additive gaussian noise is independent at each antenna , @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 forms an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "note also that @xmath28 gives the energy present in the @xmath20 frequency at the @xmath29 antenna .",
    "in this section , we assume that transmission takes place over coherent fading channels and hence @xmath17 for all @xmath30 is known to the receiver while the transmitter does not have such knowledge . conditioned on @xmath17 and the transmitted signal @xmath14 , @xmath31 is a proper complex gaussian random variable with mean value and variance given by @xmath32 therefore , @xmath33 is chi - square distributed with the following conditional probability density function ( pdf ) :    @xmath34    it is assumed that the receiver , using equal gain combining ( egc ) , combines the energies of the @xmath20 frequency components at each antenna , i.e. , computes the total energy @xmath35 since the noise components are independent , @xmath36 is a sum of independent chi - square random variables , and is itself also chi - square distributed with @xmath37 degrees of freedom .",
    "the conditional pdf is given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 is the @xmath42 order modified bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath43 is the gamma function .",
    "the receiver employs maximum a posteriori probability ( map ) criterion to detect the transmitted signals .",
    "let @xmath44\\ ] ] be the vector of energy values corresponding to each frequency . since the noise components @xmath22 are independent for different @xmath27 , components of @xmath45 are mutually independent .",
    "hence , the conditional pdf of @xmath45 is then , the map rule that detects @xmath46 for @xmath47 is @xmath48 where we have used the fact that the prior probabilities of the transmitted signals are @xmath49 for @xmath6 , and @xmath50 . substituting ( [ pdf_sm ] ) into to ( [ compare1 ] ) , the decision rule is simplified to : @xmath51 where @xmath52 the following lemma enables us to further simplify the detection rule .",
    "the function @xmath53 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath54 .",
    "_ proof _ : the derivative of the @xmath55 order modified bessel function is @xmath56 hence , @xmath57 where we use the fact that @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "then , the derivative of @xmath60 satisfies @xmath61 proving that @xmath62 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath63    by the above result , the detection rule ( [ com1 ] ) further simplifies to @xmath64 where @xmath65 . since @xmath60 is a monotonically increasing function , the inverse @xmath66 is well - defined .",
    "note that ( [ finalcompare1 ] ) is the rule that detects the signal @xmath14 for @xmath47 .",
    "the zero signal @xmath7 is detected if @xmath67      in this section , we analyze the error probability of oofsk modulation when map detection is used at the receiver .",
    "suppose without loss of generality that @xmath68 is the transmitted signal .",
    "let @xmath69 .",
    "then the correct detection probability is @xmath70 from @xcite , we have @xmath71 therefore , the correct detection probability can now be expressed as @xmath72^{m-1}f_{r_1| { \\mathbf{h } } , s_1}(x)dx\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the binomial theorem , @xmath73 becomes @xmath74^n\\!\\!\\!f_{r_1| { \\mathbf{h } } , s_1}(x)dx\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the multinomial theorem , we have the following expansion @xmath75^n = e^{-nx}\\sum_{i=0}^{n(l-1)}c_{in}x^i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the coefficient of @xmath77 in the expansion .",
    "@xmath76 can be evaluated from the recursive equation @xcite @xmath78}(q)\\ ] ] where @xmath79}(q)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll } 1 , \\quad a\\leq q\\leq b\\\\ 0 , \\quad \\text{otherwise } \\end{array } \\right .. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the multinomial expansion , @xmath73 becomes @xmath80}i_{l-1}(2\\sqrt{x\\xi})dx\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let @xmath81 and @xmath82 , then , @xmath73 can be written as @xmath83\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the confluent hypergeometric function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap 10 ) .",
    "the probability of correct detection when signal @xmath7 is transmitted is : @xmath85 hence , the probability of error as a function of the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath86 since the channel is assumed to be known , error probability in ( [ eq : proboferror ] ) is a function of the fading coefficients through @xmath87 .",
    "hence , the average probability of error is obtained by computing @xmath88 if @xmath17 is a complex gaussian random variable with mean value @xmath89 and variance @xmath90 and @xmath91 are mutually independent , @xmath92 is a chi - square random variable with @xmath37 degrees of freedom and has a pdf given by @xmath93 where , @xmath94 .",
    "when the fading coefficients @xmath91 are correlated , the average error probability @xmath95 can be obtained by evaluating the expected value of @xmath96 with respect to the joint distribution of @xmath97 , which involves @xmath13-fold integration . however ,",
    "if @xmath98 are nakagami-@xmath99 distributed , closed - form expressions for @xmath100 are provided in @xcite , which lead to a single integration .",
    "next , we present the simulation results .",
    "we define the rician factor as @xmath101 and correlation coefficient as @xmath102 .",
    "figures [ 2uncoco ] , [ 3uncoco ] , and [ 2coco ] plot the probability of error curves as a function of snr for 4-oofsk signaling over rician fading channels with different number of receiver antennas and different duty factors .",
    "two independent channels are considered in fig .",
    "[ 2uncoco ] .",
    "note that conventional fsk corresponds to oofsk with duty factor @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "[ 3uncoco ] , three independent channels are assumed . in both figures ,",
    "we observe an improvement in the error probability curves if the duty factor @xmath10 of oofsk signaling is less than 0.5 .",
    "when @xmath104 , we see approximately an order of magnitude improvement in the error performance .",
    "this results in substantial energy gains for fixed value of error probability , rendering oofsk signaling a very energy efficient transmission technique .",
    "it can also immediately be noted that due to increased diversity , having more antennas decreases the error rates . in fig .",
    "[ 2coco ] , the case of two correlated channels is investigated .",
    "although the performance is deteriorated due to correlation , oofsk with sufficiently small duty factor still considerably improves the error performance .",
    "it should be noted that having small duty factor means that fsk signals have high peak power but they are transmitted less frequently to satisfy the average power constraint . consequently , having high peak power signals decrease the error rates .",
    "in the noncoherent channel case , we assume that the realizations of the fading coefficients @xmath91 are unknown at both the receiver and transmitter . the receiver is only equipped with the knowledge of the statistics of @xmath91 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath91 are i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random variables with @xmath105 and @xmath106 . therefore , conditioned on @xmath14 being the transmitted signal",
    ", @xmath31 is a complex gaussian random variable with @xmath107 similarly as in the coherent case , we combine the energies of the @xmath108 frequency components across the antennas , and obtain @xmath109 . conditioned on transmitted signal @xmath14 , @xmath36 is a chi - square random variable with the following pdf : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the vector @xmath113 $ ] has the following conditional joint pdf the map decision rule that detects @xmath46 for @xmath47 is @xmath114 similarly as in section [ sec : coherent ] , it can be easily shown that @xmath115 is a monotonically increasing function . with this observation , the decision rule in ( [ compare1nc ] ) simplifies to @xmath116 where @xmath117 note that @xmath118 is the detected signal if @xmath119 for all @xmath120 .",
    "we first assume that @xmath68 is transmitted .",
    "let @xmath121 .",
    "then , the probability of correct detection is @xmath122 following an approach similar to that in section [ sec : coherent ] , we have @xmath123 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath7 is the transmitted signal , the probability of correct detection is @xmath124 finally , the average probability of error is @xmath125 figures [ 2non ] , [ 3non ] , and [ 3noncor ] provide the simulation results of error probability when 4-oofsk signals are transmitted over noncoherent rician fading channels . in figs .",
    "[ 2non ] and [ 3non ] , the channels are assumed to be independent . in these figures , it is seen that oofsk signaling with @xmath126 and @xmath127 have worse error performance when compared to that of conventional fsk ( oofsk with @xmath103 ) . as evidenced in the graph of @xmath128 ,",
    "if the duty factor is sufficiently decreased , and hence consequently the peak power is increased , we start seeing improvements .",
    "since fading is not known in the noncoherent case , the advantage of using oofsk signaling is twofold .",
    "having low duty cycle allows the fsk signals to have high peak power which is especially beneficial when channel characteristics are unknown .",
    "in addition , when the zero signal @xmath7 is sent , the received signal is composed of additive noise and is free of fading coefficients .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ 3noncor ] plots the error probabilities when 4-oofsk signals are sent over two correlated noncoherent channels .",
    "these curves are obtained when the detection rule ( [ ncfinalcompare1 ] ) derived for independent channels are employed at the receiver .",
    "we note that the performance degrades due to correlation in noncoherent channels as well .",
