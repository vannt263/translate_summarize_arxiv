    "multiple - input multiple - out ( mimo ) wireless communications have been witnessed to offer large gains in spectral efficiency and reliability @xcite .",
    "efficient designs of signal transmission schemes include space - time ( st ) codes over mimo systems have been active areas of research over the past decade @xcite .",
    "orthogonal st block code ( ostbc ) is one of the most powerful st code designs due to its simple low - complexity maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding while achieving maximum diversity gain @xcite .",
    "however , it is found that ostbc has a low code rate that can not be above @xmath2 symbols per channel use for more than two transmit antennas @xcite . to improve the code rate of the stbc ,",
    "numerous code designs have been developed including quasi - orthogonal stbc @xcite and stbc based on algebraic number theory @xcite .",
    "two typical designs of those codes are threaded algebraic st ( tast ) codes @xcite and cyclic division algebra based st codes @xcite which have been shown to obtain full rate and full diversity .",
    "the full rate means @xmath1 symbols per channel use for @xmath1 transmit antennas .",
    "note that the ostbc for two transmit antennas , also namely alamouti code @xcite , has a rate of @xmath3 symbol per channel use only , i.e. , two independent information symbols are sent through a codeword occupying two symbol intervals . since most of the high - rate stbc are designed based on the rank criterion which was derived from the pairwise error probability of the st codes with ml decoding @xcite , they have to rely on the ml decoding to collect the full diversity .",
    "considering that the ml decoding complexity grows exponentially with the number of information symbols embedded in the codeword , the high - rate stbc obtain the full diversity at a price of the large decoding complexity .",
    "recently , several fast decodable stbc have been proposed to reduce the high decoding complexity while not compromising too much performance gains @xcite .",
    "mimo systems with linear receivers have also received a lot of research attention and information - theoretic analysis has been done in @xcite .",
    "efficient designs of st codes for transmission over mimo systems with linear receivers have also been studied in @xcite .",
    "linear receiver based stbc designs are attractive because they can exploit both gains of efficiency and reliability of the signal transmission over mimo systems with a low - complexity receiver such as zero - forcing ( zf ) or minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver . similar to the ostbc , the stbc designs in @xcite can also obtain full diversity with linear receivers .",
    "however , it is found that the rate of the linear receiver based stbc is upper bounded by one @xcite , though it is larger than that of ostbc . to address the complexity and rate tradeoff , a partial interference cancelation ( pic ) group decoding for mimo systems was proposed and the design criterion of stbc with pic group decoding was also derived in @xcite . in fact , the pic group decoding can be viewed as an intermediate decoding approach between the ml receiver and the zf receiver by trading a simple single - symbol decoding complexity for a higher code rate more than one symbol per channel use .",
    "very recently , a systematic design of stbc achieving full diversity with pic group decoding was proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , the decoding complexity of the stbc design in @xcite is still equivalent to a joint ml decoding of @xmath1 symbols .    in order to further reduce the decoding complexity , in this paper",
    "we propose a new design of stbc with pic group decoding which can obtain both full diversity and low - complexity decoding , i.e. , only half complexity of the stbc in @xcite .",
    "our proposed stbc is featured as an alamouti block matrix , i.e. , every element of the @xmath4 alamouti code matrix is replaced by an elementary matrix and each elementary matrix is designed from multiple diagonal layers .",
    "it should be mentioned that in @xcite the similar alamouti block matrix was used where each entry of the alamouti matrix was replaced by a toeplitz stbc .",
    "the major difference between the stbc in @xcite and our proposed stbc lie in the construction of elementary matrix , i.e. , the toeplitz matrix used in @xcite and the multiple diagonal layers used in our codes .",
    "while the stbc in @xcite achieves the full diversity with linear receivers but the code rate is not more than @xmath3 .",
    "it will be shown that our proposed stbc can achieve full diversity under both ml and pic group decoding and the code rate can be up to @xmath5 when full diversity is obtained .",
    "our simulation results demonstrate that the codes can obtain similar good performance to the codes in @xcite but a half decoding complexity is reduced .",

    "ii , the system model is described and the pic group decoding algorithm is reviewed . in section iii ,",
    "a design of stbc achieving full diversity with a reduced - complexity pic group decoding is proposed .",

    "a few code design examples are given .",

    "we suppose that channel state information ( csi ) is known at receiver only .",
    "therefore , the signal power is allocated uniformly across the transmit antennas in the absence of transmitter csi .    in this paper",
    ", we consider that information symbols @xmath19 are coded by linear dispersion stbc as @xmath22 . to decode the transmitted sequence @xmath39 , we need to extract @xmath39 from @xmath22 . through some operations , we can get an equivalent signal model from ( [ eqn : y ] ) as @xcite@xcite@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a vector of length @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a @xmath44 noise vector , and @xmath45 is an equivalent channel matrix of size @xmath46 with @xmath47 column vectors @xmath48 for @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 $ ] .    for an ml receiver ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath51 that achieves the minimum of the squared frobenius norm is given by @xmath52 it is known that the ml decoding has prohibitively large computational complexity because it requires an exhaustive search over all candidate vectors @xmath39 .",
    "conventional linear receivers such as zf or mmse detection can reduce the decoding complexity to single symbol decoding , but it may lose some performance benefits such as diversity gain .",
    "although some linear receiver based stbc have been recently proposed in @xcite , they suffer the rate loss and the symbol rate can not be above @xmath3 symbol per channel use .",
    "very recently , in @xcite , a pic group decoding was proposed to deal with the tradeoff among rate , diversity and complexity .",
    "in fact , the pic group decoding can be viewed as a flexible decoding algorithm with adjustable receiver structure from a linear receiver to an ml receiver .",
    "next , we shall introduce the pic group decoding proposed in @xcite .",
    "define index set @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath47 is the number of information symbols in @xmath39 .",
    "we then partition @xmath53 into @xmath55 groups : @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the cardinality of the subset @xmath59 .",
    "we call @xmath60 a grouping scheme .",
    "for such a grouping scheme , we have @xmath61 and @xmath62    define @xmath63^t$ ] and @xmath64 $ ] , for @xmath65 . with these notations , ( [ eqn : y2 ] ) can be written as @xmath66 suppose that we want to decode the symbols embedded in the group @xmath67 .",
    "the pic group decoding first implements linear interference cancellation with a suitable choice of matrix @xmath68 in order to completely eliminate the interferences from other groups @xcite , i.e. , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "afterwards , the symbols in the group @xmath67 are decoded with the ml decoding algorithm as follows , @xmath76    for the pic group decoding , the following two steps are needed : the group zero - forcing to cancel the interferences coming from all the other groups as shown in ( [ eqn : gzf ] ) and the group ml decoding to jointly decode the symbols in one group as shown in ( [ eqn : pic ] ) .",
    "therefore , the decoding complexity of the pic group decoding should reside in the above two steps .",
    "note that the interference cancellation process shown in ( [ eqn : gzf ] ) mainly involves with linear matrix computations , whose computational complexity is small compared to the ml decoding for an exhaustive search of all candidate symbols .",
    "therefore , to evaluate the decoding complexity of the pic group decoding , we mainly focus on the computational complexity of the ml decoding within the pic group decoding algorithm .",
    "the ml decoding complexity can be characterized by the number of frobenius norms calculated in the decoding process @xcite . in the pic group",
    "decoding algorithm the complexity is then @xmath77 .",
    "it can be seen that the pic group decoding provides a flexible decoding complexity which can be from the zf decoding complexity @xmath78 to the ml decoding complexity @xmath79 .    in @xcite , a successive interference cancellation ( sic)-aided pic group decoding algorithm ,",
    "namely pic - sic group decoding was proposed .",
    "similar to the blast detection algorithm @xcite , the pic - sic group decoding is performed after removing the already - decoded symbol set from the received signals to reduce the interference .",
    "if each group has only one symbol , then the pic - sic group decoding will be equivalent to the blast detection .    in @xcite ,",
