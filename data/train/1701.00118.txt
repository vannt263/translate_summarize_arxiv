    "in this second contribution on the fabry - perot cavity , we propose to develop a complementary approach , called _ semi - classical physics _ , which turns out to be of broad validity and applicability @xcite .",
    "these techniques were developed in the early birth of quantum physics @xcite and were extended to almost all domains where a transition from a wave description to geometrical concepts makes sense , from nuclear physics @xcite to acoustics @xcite and hydrodynamics @xcite , and even in quantum gravity @xcite . in electromagnetism , it simply corresponds to the transition from wave optics to geometrical optics .",
    "+ in this article , we illustrate these methods on the well - known fabry - perot cavity and describe its features from an unusual perspective .",
    "the theory is compared with experiments based on microcavity lasers @xcite .",
    "these microlasers are not to be viewed simply as downscaled versions of large laser cavities , such as studied in part i @xcite , but are also permit a wealth of quasi - unlimited cavity shapes , which are defined by their external boundary .",
    "such shapes can be tailored to any geometry of interest , either in a planar two - dimensional geometry as studied in this article or in three dimensions , the latter an emerging field beyond the scope of this article @xcite .",
    "optical microcavities have been studied in great depth over the last two decades by means of a dual perspective based on ray optics and wave optics , in the same spirit as for the macroscopic cavities discussed in part i. this dual approach has led to a confrontation of the two points of view , as in part i , driven by the need to ensure compatibility and to explore the relevant connections between these two approaches . the main differences to part i are , first , that the relations between the spectrum of the cavity and periodic orbits are explored and , second , that modes beyond a paraxial description are observed experimentally .",
    "+ the toolbox for connecting ray optics with a modal picture has been developed since the seventies within the framework of semiclassical physics @xcite .",
    "initially triggered by nuclear physics where statistical regularities were shown to underpin the complexity of the spectra of nuclei @xcite , it was later applied to connect the spectra of closed microwave cavities with the periodic orbits of classical billiards @xcite , and more recently to the case of open optical cavities where radiation is only partially confined by reflections at the dielectric interfaces @xcite .",
    "the density of states , a familiar notion in classical as well as quantum physics , in optics and solid state physics alike , can be connected to the set of all periodic orbits , which are purely classical quantities , by virtue of the celebrated _ trace formula _ , which has been proposed in the seventies @xcite , and progressively extended to a broad variety of quantum- and wave - mechanical systems . +",
    "this trace formula is the cornerstone of a semiclassical approach to resonators , but its implementation is far from obvious .",
    "indeed the beauty and simplicity of its formulation must not hide the technical difficulties that are met in practice , even in the simple cases on which we will concentrate hereafter .",
    "its ingredients are on the one hand the solutions of maxwell s equations to obtain the density of electromagnetic modes , and on the other hand geometric considerations to obtain the periodic orbits , which are usually non - trivial , depending on the nature of the resonator shape .",
    "a vital role is played by the stability of the periodic orbits , which determines the expansion amplitudes and thus their weight of contribution to the trace formula . in order to put our approach on simple but solid grounds , we start with the illustrative case of the plane - parallel fabry - perot cavity , where the identification of the periodic orbits is straightforward , allowing to concentrate on the methodology and its physical significance .",
    "we then move on to plano - concave fabry - perot microcavities like those considered in part i. + one main result , which connects in an essential manner the two parts of this series , is the recognition of the role of modal degeneracy , here based on the full calculation of the stability - related amplitudes in the trace formula .",
    "the condition for such degeneracy is shown to take the same form as already established in part i [ see eq .",

    ".      in some respects , a laser can exhibit intriguing and counter - intuitive features .",

    "why these modes and not others , since there are so many modes in the passive cavity ?",
    "+ for cavities much larger than the wavelength , the wave properties are based on the periodic orbits of the passive cavity , which are closed periodic geometrical trajectories @xcite .",

    "+ the stability property does not refer to the whole cavity , but to a single periodic orbit .",
    "in general , the fabry - perot cavities are used in paraxial conditions and the gain is localized along the principal axis .",

    "+ the aim of this paper is to give precise answers to each of these questions .",
    "the trace formula was developed in the seventies @xcite and stands out due to its ability to express a spectrum , which is a notion that intrinsically belongs to wave mechanics alone , in terms of geometric entities which are pertaining to classical physics .",

    "a pedagogical derivation of the trace formula is proposed in @xcite for integrable systems (  3 ) and chaotic systems (  4 ) .",
