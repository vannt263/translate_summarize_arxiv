    "since maxwell s first paper @xcite on the kinetic theory of gases , shear viscosity as well as the other transport properties are known to find their origin in the microscopic motion of atoms and molecules composing matter .",
    "however , it is only since the fifties that exact formulas are known to calculate the transport coefficients in terms of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "these so - called green - kubo formulas give each transport coefficient as the time integral of the autocorrelation function of some specific microscopic flux associated with the transport property of interest @xcite .",
    "today , the green - kubo technique allows us to calculate numerically the transport coefficients by simulating the molecular dynamics of systems with a finite number of particles and periodic boundary conditions .    on the other hand , einstein classic work on brownian motion showed that transport properties such as diffusion can also be understood in terms of random walks .",
    "it was helfand @xcite who identified in 1960 the fluctuating quantities which , by their random walk , are associated with each transport coefficients .",
    "these fluctuating quantities are the so - called helfand moments and are the centroids of the conserved quantity which is transported . in principle , each transport coefficient can thus be obtained from the linear increase of the statistical variance of the corresponding helfand moment by the so - called generalized einstein relations .",
    "nevertheless , it is not yet known today how these helfand moments should be defined in molecular dynamics with periodic boundary conditions , which limits their use in numerical simulations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive an analytical expression of the helfand moment associated with viscosity for molecular dynamics with periodic boundary conditions , and to apply the helfand - moment method to the calculation of shear viscosity in the lennard - jones fluid near the triple point .",
    "already in the first numerical calculation of viscosity in 1970 @xcite , the algorithm of alder _ et al .",
    "_ was based on generalized einstein relations derived from the green - kubo formulas .",
    "the application of the pure green - kubo technique by equilibrium molecular dynamics to the lennard - jones fluid has been performed a short time after by levesque _",
    "et al _ @xcite and later by schoen and hoheisel @xcite .",
    "however , until the middle of the eighties and the work of schoen and hoheisel @xcite , as well as the one of erpenpeck using the monte - carlo metropolis method @xcite , nonequilibrium molecular dynamics was predominantly used for the computation of shear viscosity @xcite .    at the end of the eighties and",
    "the beginning of the nineties , the generalized einstein relations started to be used for calculating the transport coefficients .",
    "an alternative equilibrium molecular dynamics method has been proposed in which the variance of the time integral of the microscopic flux is calculated @xcite .",
    "actually it is the analog of the method of alder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for soft sphere potential systems .",
    "recently , this technique has been applied by meier _",
    "@xcite , and by hess and evans @xcite , the latter having rather considered an equilibrium ensemble of time averages of the flux . in this context",
    ", two important points were discussed .",
    "the first concerns the so - called _",
    "mcquarrie expression_. in his book @xcite , mcquarrie presented helfand s formula for the shear viscosity , but with a slightly different form .",
    "this difference implied a simplification of the expression , apparently giving an important advantage compared to the original formula @xcite .",
    "the second point concerned the validity of the generalized einstein relations in periodic systems @xcite . arguing that the periodic boundary conditions imply that the variance of the original expression of the _ helfand moment _ is bounded in time , the generalized einstein relations were considered to be impractical in periodic systems . in this paper , we will show that a generalized einstein relation is available for viscosity after the addition of two terms to the original helfand moment to take into account the periodicity of the system .",
    "the helfand - moment method presents the important advantage to define shear viscosity as a non - negative quantity , satisfying the positivity of the entropy production .",
    "we have previously applied such a method to a system of two hard disks with periodic boundary conditions @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we calculate the shear viscosity in a lennard - jones fluid near the triple point .",
    "we compare the results obtained by the helfand - moment method with our own green - kubo values and those found in the literature .",
    "in addition , the helfand - moment method plays an important role in the _ escape - rate formalism_. this formalism establishes direct relationships between the characteristic quantities of the microscopic chaos ( lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions ) and the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , such a relation has been studied for the viscosity in the two - hard - disk model @xcite . furthermore with the use of the helfand moment , it should be possible to construct at the microscopic level the hydrodynamic modes , which are the solutions of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this approach called the hydrodynamic - mode method has been successfully applied for diffusion @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ eh ] , we outline the theoretical background of the generalized einstein formula .",
    "section [ pbc ] is devoted to the presentation of our helfand - moment method used for the calculation of the shear viscosity in this paper . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the so - called mcquarrie expression and the validity of the generalized einstein formula for periodic systems .",
    "the results of the molecular dynamics simulations are given in section [ num ] .",
    "the comparison with our green - kubo results and previous researches are done .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "one century ago , einstein theoretically established a relationship between the diffusion coefficient of brownian motion and the random walk of the brownian particle due to its collisions with the molecules of the surrounding fluid @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the position of the colloidal particle and @xmath2 the time .",
    "thereafter , different studies led to the well - known green - kubo formula for the shear viscosity @xmath3 obtained by green @xcite , kubo @xcite and mori @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the microscopic flux associated with the shear viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is obtained in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath6 while the particle density @xmath7 remains constant . in the following",
    ", this condition is always assumed together with the limit @xmath6 .",
    "the simplicity of eq .",
    "( [ einstein.diffusion ] ) obtained by einstein presents a particular interest .",
    "the extension of such a relation to the other transport coefficients could be useful . in the sixties ,",
    "helfand proposed quantities associated with the different transport processes in order to establish einstein - like relations for the transport coefficients @xcite . in particular , we have for shear viscosity that @xmath8^{2}\\right \\rangle . \\label{einstein.shear.viscosity}\\ ] ] it can be shown @xcite that the einstein - helfand relation is equivalent to the green - kubo formula ( [ transp - coeff - gk ] ) by defining the helfand moment as : @xmath9 if the corresponding microscopic flux is the time derivative of the helfand moment : @xmath10 we notice that the limit @xmath11 should be related to the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 . indeed , for a fluid of particles confined in a finite box , the quantity ( [ helfand - moment - shear - viscosity ] ) is bounded so that the coefficient ( [ einstein.shear.viscosity ] ) would vanish if the limit @xmath11 was taken before the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the number @xmath12 of particles and the volume @xmath13 should be large enough in order that the variance of the helfand moment displays a linear increase over a sufficiently long time interval @xmath2 , allowing the coefficient @xmath3 to be well defined .",
    "the larger the system , the longer the time interval .",
    "it is in this sense that the limit @xmath14 should be considered in eq .",
    "( [ einstein.shear.viscosity ] ) .",
    "another remark is that , compared with the green - kubo formula ( [ transp - coeff - gk ] ) , eq . ( [ einstein.shear.viscosity ] ) presents the advantage to define the shear viscosity as a positive quantity , satisfying the conditions of non - negative entropy production .",
    "often , the molecular dynamics is simulated with periodic boundary conditions . in this case , the particles exiting at one boundary are reinjected at the opposite boundary . due to the periodicity of the system",
    ", particles in the simulation box may interact with image particles as well as the particles inside the original unit cell . as a consequence",
    ", the images of particle @xmath15 may contribute to the force @xmath16 applied by the particle @xmath15 on the particle @xmath17 : @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 the length of the simulation box and @xmath21 determines the cell translation vector @xcite .",
    "the range of the interaction potential must be smaller than @xmath22 to guarantee that the particle @xmath17 interacts only with one of the images of @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ periodic - force ] ) .",
    "the interacting pair is found by the minimum - image convention , @xmath23 . here",
    ", we define the quantity @xmath24 which is the vector to be added to @xmath25 in order to satisfy the minimum - image convention .    for a dynamics which is periodic in the box",
    ", the positions should jump to satisfy the minimum - image convention . as a consequence ,",
    "the positions and momenta used to calculate the viscosity by the green - kubo method actually obey the modified newtonian equations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the jump of the particle @xmath17 at time @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "we notice that the modified newtonian equations ( [ newton ] ) conserve energy , total momentum and preserve phase - space volumes ( liouville s theorem ) .",
    "moreover , we see that the periodic boundary conditions imply that the helfand moment of eq .",
    "( [ helfand - moment - shear - viscosity ] ) is bounded and can not be differentiated near the times @xmath30 of the jumps . in order to have a well - defined quantity , one should remove the discontinuities at the jumps , so that the helfand moment can grow without bound . in order to do that , we add a term @xmath31 to the original helfand moment ( [ helfand - moment - shear - viscosity ] ) to get @xmath32 according to eq .",
    "( [ derivativeg ] ) , the time derivative of the helfand moment must be the microscopic flux @xmath33 defined with the position @xmath34 of the minimum - image convention . in order to satisfy the equality ( [ derivativeg ] ) in periodic systems , we show in appendix [ appendixa ] that the term @xmath31 must be given by @xmath35 where both @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend on the time @xmath38 in the integral of the last term .",
    "we then obtain our general expression for the helfand moment in systems with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the momentum at the time of the jump @xmath30 and @xmath41 the heaviside step function defined as @xmath42 we notice that the quantity @xmath37 has discontinuous jumps in order to satisfy the minimum - image convention .",
    "let us point out that @xmath37 changes when the force @xmath43 vanishes , so that the last term varies continuously in time and does not present any jump .",
    "we notice thatthe last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ helfand - torus ] ) involves the particles near the boundaries of the box .",
    "the second term is due to the jumps of the particles to or from the neighboring boxes . the third term concerns the pairs of particles interacting between neighboring cells . the helfand moment of eq . ( [ helfand - torus ] )",
    "can be used to obtain the shear viscosity coefficient for systems with periodic boundaries thanks to the einstein - like relation ( [ einstein.shear.viscosity ] ) .",
    "since the beginning of the nineties , some confusions have been propagated in the literature concerning the use of the mean - squared displacement equation for shear viscosity .",
    "first , it concerns the so - called mcquarrie expression . on the other hand ,",
    "several works have been done which have prematurely concluded that the mean - square displacement equation for shear viscosity is inapplicable for systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these confusions and criticisms are reported in particular by erpenbeck in ref .",
    "since these questions are central in this paper , this section is devoted to such problems in order to avoid any misconception .      in his well - known and remarkable book _",
    "statistical mechanics _ , mcquarrie @xcite reported the work achieved by helfand @xcite .",
    "the derivation he proposed is quite different but he obtained the same intermediate relation as helfand , that is @xcite @xmath44 thereafter in his book , mcquarrie let as an exercise the derivation from eq .",
    "( [ helf - mcquarrie - comparison ] ) of the final expression which is printed in ref .",
    "@xcite as follows @xmath45^{2}\\right \\rangle , \\label{mcquarrie - viscosity}\\ ] ] while helfand obtained @xmath46^{2 } \\right \\rangle .",
    "\\label{helfand - viscosity}\\ ] ] the difference between both expressions is in the position of the sum over particles , and it seems that such a difference is due to a typing error .",
    "nevertheless , the mcquarrie expression ( [ mcquarrie - viscosity ] ) at first sight presents a certain advantage compared to helfand s one ( [ helfand - viscosity ] ) .",
    "indeed , the sum over the particles can come out of the average .",
    "consequently , one would obtain a sum of averages no longer depending on the different particles .",
    "( [ mcquarrie - viscosity ] ) would hold , eq .",
    "( [ mcquarrie - viscosity ] ) could be rewritten as @xmath47^{2 } \\right \\rangle .",
    "\\label{mcquarrie - viscosity-2}\\ ] ] in other words , the mcquarrie relation seems to present the advantage that shear viscosity would be evaluated through a _ single - particle _ expression whereas helfand expressed the viscosity by a _",
    "collective _ approach .",
    "the first time that eq .",
    "( [ mcquarrie - viscosity ] ) has been considered was in the work of chialvo and debenedetti @xcite . without giving a theoretical proof of the validity of the last equation or the equivalence with eq .",
    "( [ helfand - viscosity ] ) , they provided a numerical comparison between both methods and concluded that the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 is small .",
    "later , chialvo , cummings and evans @xcite also compared the mcquarrie and helfand expressions and speculated an equivalencefor theoretical reasons .",
    "thereafter , allen , brown and masters @xcite showed by comparison with their green - kubo results that the numerical calculations for shear viscosity obtained by chialvo and debenedetti @xcite were incorrect .",
    "moreover , allen devoted a comment in ref .",
    "@xcite , and concluded that the mcquarrie expression is not valid and is not able to give shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed later by erpenbeck @xcite , which settled the question . as aforementioned ,",
    "this is not really surprising since eq .",
    "( [ mcquarrie - viscosity ] ) seems quite clearly to be the result of a typing error .",
    "this discussion emphasizes the fact that viscosity is a collective transport property , implying the intervention of all the particles .",
    "the other point which was questioned is whether a mean - squared displacement equation for shear viscosity is useful for systems submitted to periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "first , it was pointed out that the well known alder _ et al .",
    "_ method initially developed for hard - ball systems @xcite is not based on the helfand expressions , but instead on the mean - square displacement of the time integral of the microscopic flux @xcite .",
    "the main doubt on the use of helfand moments in periodic systems comes from the fact that the original expression ( [ helfand - moment - shear - viscosity ] ) is bounded and would lead to a vanishing shear viscosity in the long - time limit . by this argument , allen concluded that the _ only _ correct way to handle @xmath50 is to write it as @xmath51 , and express @xmath52 in pairwise , minimum - image form @xcite .",
    "in other words , the alder _",
    "_ method would be the only valid method for studying viscosity , that is , through a method intermediate between the helfand and green - kubo methods .",
    "let us mention that this opinion was recently followed by hess , krger and evans @xcite as well as by meier , laesecke and kabelac @xcite having considered systems with soft - potential interactions .",
    "however , this does not preclude the possibility to modify the original expression ( [ helfand - moment - shear - viscosity ] ) of the helfand moment in order to recover the microscopic flux ( [ microflux ] ) .",
    "this is precisely what we have done here above with our helfand - moment method by adding the following two terms @xmath53 to the original one .",
    "albeit the first original term is bounded in time , the two new terms increase without bound in time because of the jumps and the interactions between the particle and the image particles ( due to the minimum - image convention ) .",
    "therefore , they can contribute to the linear growth in time of the variance of the helfand moment .",
    "the helfand - moment method we propose here is completely equivalent to the green - kubo formula and presents the advantage to express the transport coefficients by einstein - like relations , directly showing their positivity .",
    "we carried out molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the shear viscosity by the helfand - moment and the green - kubo methods .",
    "we use the standard 6 - 12 lennard - jones potential @xmath54\\ ] ] we use the reduced units defined in table [ tabredunit ] .",
    ".reduced units of the lennard - jones fluid . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we propose a new method for the computation of shear viscosity by molecular dynamics .",
    "the _ helfand - moment method _ is an adaptation of the helfand formula ( [ einstein.shear.viscosity ] ) for systems with periodic boundary conditions by adding two terms ( [ added - terms ] ) to the original expression of the helfand moment ( [ helfand - moment - shear - viscosity ] ) .",
    "the method consists in the calculation of the mean - square displacement of the helfand moment ( [ helfand - torus ] ) .",
    "the variance of this quantity gives the shear viscosity by the generalized einstein relation ( [ einstein.shear.viscosity ] ) .",
    "we have discussed its validity in the light of the discussions found in the literature of the beginning of the nineties .",
    "thanks to this new method , we have computed the shear viscosity in the lennard - jones fluid near the triple point .",
    "we showed that the helfand - moment method gives the same results as the standard green - kubo method .",
    "moreover , our extrapolated value of shear viscosity is in statistical agreement with those found in the literature .",
    "more than stating as an alternative method to the standard green - kubo in equilibrium molecular dynamics , the helfand - moment method is useful and plays a central role in the _ escape - rate formalism _ and the _ hydrodynamic - mode method_. indeed , in these theories , the helfand moment allows us to put in evidence fractal structures at the microscopic level , which are related to the transport processes @xcite .",
    "we remark that the method can be similarly extended to the bulk viscosity @xmath55 . as for the shear viscosity",
