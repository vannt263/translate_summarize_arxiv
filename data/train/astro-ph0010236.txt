    "the galactic centre provides our best opportunity to study the astrophysical processes in a galactic nucleus with high spatial resolution .",
    "these include star - formation and the molecular cloud structures in a region subjected to strong shear forces , magnetic fields , and gravitational potentials .",
    "thermal dust continuum emission traces the temperature - weighted column density of material in a less biased way than molecular line maps , which are affected by excitation , optical depth , and abundance variations .",
    "thus , we can use the continuum emission to map the mass distribution in molecular clouds with good accuracy and sensitivity .",
    "we used scuba ( holland et  al . 1999 ) on the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , between april 1998 and april 2000 , to map the galactic centre region in the submillimetre continuum at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the new images cover a region 4 times larger and @xmath10 times deeper than earlier surveys ( lis & carlstrom 1994 ) .",
    "the map size is approximately @xmath11 , or @xmath2 at an assumed distance of @xmath12 .",
    "the map covers the entire ` central molecular zone ' ( cmz ) , which extends to radii of @xmath13 and contains up to @xmath14 of the galaxy s molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "scuba ( holland et  al . 1999 ) is a submillimetre continuum bolometer camera with two arrays , one of 91 pixels optimised for @xmath8 , and one of 37 pixels optimised for @xmath9 . in use ,",
    "both arrays observe simultaneously .",
    "the resolution is @xmath15 fwhm at @xmath8 and @xmath16 at @xmath9 .",
    "scuba was used in scan - map mode , in which the array is scanned across the sky at a rate of @xmath17 per second whilst chopping the secondary mirror at @xmath18 .",
    "this chopping produces images in which the sky is convolved with the primary beam of the telescope and a dual - beam function , of positive and negative delta functions separated by the chop throw .    the majority of the map was observed six separate times , with chop throws of 20 , 30 , and @xmath19 in both r.a . and dec . , although some fields at the galactic eastern and western ends were observed with 30 , 44 , and @xmath20 chops .",
    "each dual - beam image contains no information at spatial frequencies equal to the inverse chop throw and its harmonics , and the constant power level ( zero spatial frequency ) is also lost .",
    "the data were reduced with surf , the standard scuba reduction software ( jenness & lightfoot 1999 ) , using the `` emerson 2 '' deconvolution algorithm .",
    "this algorithm combines the multiple chop - throw images of the map fields .",
    "a weighted average of these observations is formed in fourier space , and the reverse transform yields the final map ( jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) .",
    "although the combination of multiple chops improves the spatial frequency coverage , it is unavoidable that spatial scales more extended than a few times the maximum chop - throw are measured with reduced sensitivity , and the zero spatial frequency is still lost . ultimately , the survey is sensitive to spatial scales in the approximate range @xmath21 ( the beam size at @xmath8 ) to @xmath22 ( a few times the maximum chop - throw ) .",
    "calibration was performed from maps of uranus and mars , and all data were corrected for atmospheric extinction using skydips .",
    "zenith opacities were in the range 0.10.45 at @xmath9 and 0.332.5 at @xmath8 .",
    "most of the data in the central @xmath23 region was observed in extremely good weather , with @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    to calibrate fluxes of extended structures , the integrated signal in a @xmath26 diameter aperture was used to calculate a conversion factor in @xmath27v@xmath28 .",
    "calibration relative to the primary calibrators is estimated to be accurate to 5% at @xmath9 and 20% at @xmath8 , based on the dispersion of measured flux conversion factors , although absolute cloud fluxes also depend on corrections for constant map offsets as described in section [ sec : corr - artef ] .",
    "the survey has resolutions of approximately @xmath15 at @xmath8 and @xmath16 at @xmath9 , corresponding to distances of @xmath6 and @xmath29 at a distance of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31-@xmath32 sensitivities per beam are approximately @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , or @xmath37 per beam with the assumptions in section [ sec : cloud - masses ] .      making large - scale scuba scan - maps is difficult for several reasons .",
    "the total power level is not recorded , so there may be a constant offset on each field , and this offset may in general vary between fields in the mosaic . within individual fields , one must account for baseline removal on the time - series signals from the bolometers",
    ". the dual - beam chop will suppress information at certain spatial frequencies , as described above , and as there is so much extended structure in the cmz it is difficult to scan or chop onto regions of no emission .",
    "some previous scuba scan - maps have sometimes exhibited reduction artefacts , such as negative troughs around bright sources .",
    "we have found that negative troughs can be greatly reduced by careful baseline removal on a per - bolometer basis .",
    "a single @xmath38 map is contructed from typically 1015 scans of the array across the field . calculating a baseline separately for each scan will produce large spurious offsets for those scans which pass over bright structure ,",
    "so ideally it is best to determine a baseline using only those scans which contain little bright emission .",
    "this proved impossible for a region as rich in structure as the galactic centre , but we have found that using the median level over all the scans for each bolometer does produce good results without the spurious offsets .",
    "this is the largest area ever scan - mapped at 450 and @xmath9 , with more than fifty overlapping @xmath38 fields , which must be mosaiced to form the final image .",
    "the starlink ccdpack package ( draper , taylor , & allan 2000 ) was used to combine the dual - beam images and remove relative level offsets between fields of order 10 and @xmath39 at 450 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "we then applied further corrections to ensure that the pixel mean calculated along the chop throw direction was zero , for all of the mosaiced dual - beam maps .",
    "this must be true , as long as the edges of the map are essentially emission - free , and is necessary because incorrect zero levels in the mosaiced dual - beam maps will translate to slopes in the final images .",
    "we finally corrected for the constant zero offset on the entire map by measuring the typical zero levels from map areas devoid of identifiable clouds , and assigning an uncertainty based on the level variations .",
    "the final uncertainty in baseline levels is @xmath40 and @xmath41 at 450 and @xmath9 respectively , the former being higher in part due to the greater calibration uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties have been neglected , compared to the sensitivity noise levels of the maps .",
    "our maps ( figures [ fig : sho ] and [ fig : lon ] ) show good correspondence with previous surveys of the region , such as that by & carlstrom ( 1994 ) but with much higher sensitivity and resolution . at @xmath9",
    "we can clearly see the central source sgr  a * and its circum - nuclear disc ( cnd ) ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , although these features are less pronounced at @xmath8 .",
    "we also see the compact gmcs m-0.13 - 0.08 ( the @xmath3 cloud ) and m-0.02 - 0.07 ( the @xmath44 cloud ) .",
    "close to this is the high - velocity molecular cloud co 0.020.02 ( oka et  al .",
    "1999 ) . at higher galactic longitude",
    "we see the pistol region ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , other gmcs such as m0.25 + 0.01 ( lis et  al .",
    "1994 ) , sgr  b1 ( @xmath47 ) and b2 ( @xmath48 ) , and the sgr  d ( @xmath49 ) star - forming region . at more negative longitudes",
    ", the map extends to the sgr  c ( @xmath50 ) star forming region .",
    "all of the field is rich in extended structure , dominated by filamentary clouds and cavities which may be associated with supernova remnants .",
    "such structures have also been observed by ( 1998 ) in co ( @xmath51@xmath52 ) emission .      at both wavelengths we have a clear detection of the sgr  a * point - source . by taking slices through the position of sgr  a * to determine and remove the local background",
    ", we estimate the flux from sgr  a * itself , with quoted 1-@xmath32 uncertainties .",
    "the results are also subject to the overall calibration uncertainties described in section [ sec : observ - data - reduct ] .",
    "at @xmath9 we measure a flux of @xmath53 .",
    "this is consistent with the value measured from cso - jcmt interferometry ( serabyn et  al .",
    "1997 ) of @xmath54 . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the same procedure gives a flux for sgr  a * of @xmath55 .",
    "this is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath56 found by ( 1993 ) .",
    "these fluxes are somewhat lower than those measured by ( 1995 ) , which were @xmath57 at @xmath58 ( rather than @xmath9 ) and @xmath59 at @xmath8 , suggesting that there may be some variability of the sgr  a * point source . for example , , miyazaki , & tsutsumi ( 1999 ) observed a flare at 3 mm during which the flux doubled , and ( 1997 ) found a flux of @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "our fluxes indicate a spectral index for the emission from sgr  a * of @xmath62 , consistent with a non - dust component in the emission .",
    "flux values for the synchrotron component from the postulated black hole are discussed further by ( 2000 ) .",
    "although we can calculate spectral indices in the submillimetre regime from the scuba data , these data do not constrain the overall form of the dust emission , and do not allow us to estimate the temperature of the dust . to do this , we need data around the peak of the emission , which for dust at these temperatures is in the far infra - red .    we have combined our submillimetre data with @xmath63 data from the iras galaxy atlas ( cao et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and fitted a single temperature greybody spectrum of the form @xmath64 , where the optical depth @xmath65 is expressed in terms of an index @xmath66 and a critical frequency @xmath67 at which the emission becomes optically thick : @xmath68 .",
    "although the iras galaxy atlas also contains @xmath69 data , we believe that emission at this wavelength traces a higher temperature component . by fitting to the @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath63 points",
    "we calculate properties of the cold dust only .",
    "we have performed a least - squares greybody fit to the three datasets over the survey area , fitting for temperature @xmath70 and critical frequency @xmath67 .",
    "we fixed @xmath71 , the theoretical maximum for crystalline dust grains .",
    "since the resolution of the iras images was approximately @xmath72 , the scuba data were also smoothed to this resolution .",
    "the fits indicate a fairly uniform dust temperature of @xmath73 . there are no signs of strong temperature variations correlated with individual clouds , and",
    "this is further evidence that the brightness structure in the maps is dominated by column density variations .",
    "therefore , we adopt a typical temperature of @xmath74 throughout the rest of this paper .    if @xmath66 is allowed to vary , the fit is better but the derived temperature does not significantly change .",
    "best - fit values of @xmath66 are @xmath75 , higher than the canonical value of @xmath71 .",
    "there is now much evidence for @xmath76 : & menten ( 1998 ) and ( 1999 ) measured @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively in gcm0.25 + 0.01 . in other regions , ( 1998 ) measure @xmath66 values as high as @xmath79 in the orion ridge and ( 1999 ) also report pronaos observations of high @xmath66 in the polaris cirrus cloud . in laboratory work ( 1995 )",
    "report @xmath66 up to @xmath80 in carbon - based compounds at room temperature , and ( 1996 ) have shown @xmath76 in silicates between @xmath81 and @xmath74 .",
    "we have used our @xmath8 and @xmath9 maps to generate a map of spectral index @xmath82 ( defined by @xmath83 ) , which is shown in figure [ fig : alpha ] .",
    "we first smoothed the @xmath8 map to the lower resolution of the @xmath9 observations , and imposed a lower threshold on both maps of @xmath84 , since spectral indices derived from small flux values are subject to large errors .",
    "over most of the bright parts of the map @xmath82 is in the range 34 , indicating rather constant dust properties with a dust opacity index @xmath85 .",
    "the bulk spectral index for m-0.02 - 0.07 ( the @xmath4 cloud ) is @xmath86 , whereas for m-0.13 - 0.08 ( the @xmath3 cloud ) it is @xmath87 ( quoted errors are from the variation within the clouds ) . assuming greybody emission at a dust temperature of @xmath74 , these indicate dust opacity indices of @xmath88@xmath89 .",
    "although @xmath71 is the theoretical upper limit for crystalline dust grains , in section [ sec : greybody - fitting ] we discuss some evidence for higher values of @xmath66 .",
    "differences in spectral index may be due to differences in temperature .",
    "since at these temperatures , emission at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is not truly in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum , the difference between the spectral index @xmath82 and the dust opacity index @xmath66 is temperature dependent .",
    "it is therefore possible that two clouds may have the same @xmath66 but different temperatures , leading to different spectral indices .",
    "if this were the case , a lower @xmath82 would indicate a cooler cloud .",
    "this can not account for all the @xmath82 variations : for example , @xmath82 is _ low _ at only @xmath90 for co 0.02 - 0.02 , and this cloud is thought to be relatively _ hot _ at @xmath91 ( oka et  al .",
    "1999 ) . in section",
    "[ sec : greybody - fitting ] , we detect no significant temperature variations on @xmath92 scales .",
    "to estimate the total cloud masses from their integrated fluxes , we require the grain absorption cross - section per unit mass of gas and dust .",
    "we have adopted the parameters suggested by ( 1994 ) with opacity index @xmath93 , and a correction for galactic centre metallicity @xmath94 ( mezger et  al .",
    "we thus derive opacities of @xmath95 and @xmath96 . assuming a uniform dust temperature of @xmath74 we have for @xmath97 and @xmath9 , conversion factors of 63.3 and 513 @xmath98 respectively .",
    "the total mass found by the survey , measured by integrating the total @xmath9 brightness , is then @xmath99 .",
    "the largest source of error in these mass measurements is our uncertainty of the dust temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is derived in section [ sec : greybody - fitting ] , but , carlstrom , & keene ( 1991 ) adopt a mean temperature of @xmath100 .",
    "however , the iso study of gcm0.25 + 0.01 by & menten ( 1998 ) gives a mean temperature of @xmath101 for this core , suggesting that the lower dust temperatures are correct .",
    "we neglect optical depth effects as the emission is optically thin at @xmath9 except from sgr  b2 .",
    "the improved depth , resolution , and extent of the scuba survey reveal many new features in the galactic centre .",
    "not only are there the known large star - forming cloud complexes but also a wide - ranging network of dusty filaments is revealed .",
    "for example , at negative galactic longitudes close to @xmath102 there is filamentary structure which may be continuous and stretches along the galactic plane for up to @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "there are partial shells , possibly associated with the known snrs sgr  a east ( g0.0 + 0.0 ) , g0.3 + 0.0 , g0.9 + 0.1 , and g1.4 - 0.1 ( green 1998 ) .",
    "there is also a circular shell of dust clouds centred on @xmath105 which does not appear to be documented , and which we have labelled ppr  g0.80 - 0.18 .",
    "this may trace a wind - blown region or perhaps a supernova remnant . in a future paper",
    ", we will contrast these structures with star - forming regions near the solar circle , comparing masses , densities , dust grain properties and star - forming efficiency .",
    "the total mass detected by our survey is @xmath99 , in the inner @xmath7 .",
    "( 1998 ) derived a weighted best estimate of the total mass in the inner @xmath106 of the galactic centre using a combination of dust emission , gamma rays , and c@xmath107o molecular line emission .",
    "this estimate was @xmath108@xmath109 .",
    "the best optically - thin tracer in this set is the c@xmath107o survey , from which was derived a mass of @xmath110 in the central @xmath106 .",
    "although our survey covers a smaller area , the total mass detected is significantly greater .",
    "therefore , the scuba data comprise the first optically - thin map to trace essentially all the mass in the cmz at high resolution .",
