    "the concept of the parity - time @xmath0 symmetry was originally elaborated in the field theory @xcite , as a generalization of the canonical conservative systems , which are based on hermitian hamiltonians , for a special case of dissipative systems which include exactly balanced and spatially separated linear gain and loss .",
    "such systems are described by non - hermitian hamiltonians , whose hermitian and anti - hermitian parts are spatially even and odd , respectively . a distinctive feature of the non - hermitian hamiltonians , which are subject to the condition of the @xmath0 symmetry , is the fact that , up to a certain critical value of the strength of their anti - hermitian ( dissipative ) part , the spectrum of such hamiltonians may remain purely real ( physical ) . when this occurs a @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian can be eventually transformed into hermitian ones by means of similarity transformations  @xcite .    in terms of the quantum theory , @xmath0-symmetric systems are the settings of theoretical interest .",
    "for the realization of the @xmath0 symmetry in real settings , one can make use of the fact that the linear propagation equation derived for optical beams in the paraxial approximation has essentially the same form as the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics , in one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) cases alike . in other words , the evolution of the wave function of a quantum particle may be emulated by the transmission of an optical beam , as in both cases the wave propagation follows the same principles .",
    "this fact makes it possible to simulate many quantum - mechanical phenomena by means of relatively simple settings which can be realized in classical optics @xcite . in this vein ,",
    "the realization of @xmath0-symmetric settings in optical systems , which combine spatially symmetric refractive - index landscapes and mutually balanced spatially separated gain and loss , was proposed in 18 ( see also  @xcite for subsequent early development of optical applications ) and experimentally demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "typically , the models amount to the 1d or 2d linear schrdinger equations with a complex potential , whose real and imaginary parts are , respectively , spatially even and odd . another possibility of the realization of the @xmath0-symmetric settings in optics , in the form a dual - core coupler , with the mutually balanced gain and loss applied to the two cores , was recently proposed in the works  @xcite for stationary regime of light propagation and in  c : solitons1,c : solitons2,c : solitons3 for the bright optical solitons which exist when the arms of the coupler obey kerr nonlinearity . in this",
    "last setting , the solitons are available in the exact analytical form , and their stability boundary can be found analytically too  c : solitons1,c : solitons3 .    a natural extension of the analysis of the nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems is to search for stable dark solitons in them , which is subject of the present work .",
    "we notice that the dark solitons in a parabolic potential with a @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian part , where they can be considered as the nonlinear modes , bifurcating from the first excited state of the linear @xmath0-symmetric parabolic potential , have recently been addressed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "an alternative natural setting for the consideration of dark solitons in @xmath1-symmetric optical systems is provided by the above - mentioned dual - core system . as well as a broad class of other solutions , dark solitons in this system can be easily found in an exact form @xcite , the actual problem being the analysis of their stability and interactions .",
    "the model is introduced in sec .",
    "ii , and the modulational stability of the cw ( continuous - wave ) background , supporting the dark solitons , which is a necessary condition for their stability , is investigated in an analytical form in sec .",
    "the mathematical framework for the full analysis of the dark - soliton stability is introduced in sec .",
    "iv , and numerical results , which can be summarized in the form of stability diagrams for the @xmath2-symmetric dark solitons , are reported in section v. collisions between dark solitons are briefly considered in sec .",
    "the paper is concluded by sec .",
    "we start with the system of equations for scaled field variables @xmath3 :    [ eq : nls_comp_gen ] @xmath4here the linear - coupling constant is scaled to be one , positive coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 account for the gain and loss , respectively , in the two cores , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real coefficients of cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) and self - phase modulation ( spm ) .    since the subject of the work is the existence and dynamics of dark solitons , it is first necessary to address the existence and modulational stability of the carrier - wave ( cw ) background , i.e. , solutions in the form of    @xmath9    with complex amplitudes @xmath10 and real propagation constant @xmath11 . the substitution of this into eqs .",

    "the propagation constant of this solution is @xmath16note that , according to eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) , the cw amplitudes in the two components are related by @xmath17 , which implies the balance between the gain and loss in the cw state .",
    "further , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) that the background amplitudes have a singularity at @xmath18 , and this solution exists only at @xmath19 .",
    "this last condition has simple physical explanation : it requires the gain ( dissipation ) in an arm to be small enough for being compensated by the energy flow from the other arm with dissipation ( gain ) , the flow being limited by the strength of linear coupling ( responsible for the power transfer between the arms ) which in our case is normalized to one .    in what follows we concentrate on the case of the @xmath0-symmetry , with @xmath20 .",
    "then , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) that the nonzero cw background may exist only with symmetric spm coefficients , @xmath21 , and for @xmath22 , hence it is convenient to define @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , and rewrite eqs .",

    "recently , it was demonstrated that , in comparison with the well - known results for the spm - nonlinear dual - core system with the purely linear coupling c : wabnitz , the addition of the xpm terms essentially affects the symmetry - breaking transformations of bright solitons  @xcite and patterns in the form of domain walls  @xcite in the conservative nonlinear coupler , whose model amounts to eqs .",

    "this , in particular , means that the stability of the cw does not depend on its amplitude @xmath48 , being determined solely by the interplay between the spm and xpm coefficients .",

    "( i.e. , when @xmath52 ) the increase of the gain - loss coefficient , ( i.e. of @xmath55 ) , results in narrowing the modulational stability domain , which collapses at @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mi - lim](b , c ) .",
    "the limit case of @xmath58 deserves special consideration , since in this case system ( [ eq : nls_gen ] ) becomes effectively linear for equal amplitudes of components @xmath59 does not depend on @xmath60 . here",
