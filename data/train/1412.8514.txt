    "according to the renormalization group ( rg ) invariance  @xcite , a physical observable should not depend on any `` unphysical '' choices . in another words",
    ", the rg - invariance indicates that the dependence of an observable on the renormalization scheme and scale should vanish . however , for fixed - order pqcd approximations , the renormalization scheme and scale dependence from both the running coupling and the corresponding expansion coefficients at the same order do not exactly cancel . to deal with a fixed - order calculation ,",
    "one usually takes the renormalization scale as the typical momentum transfer of the process , or a value to minimize the contributions of large loop diagrams , and varies it over a certain range to ascertain its uncertainty .",
    "this conventional scale setting procedure leads to well - known renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities and assigns an arbitrary range and an arbitrary systematic error to fixed - order pqcd predictions . to solve such renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities ,",
    "it is helpful to find a general way to set the optimal scale and hence the optimal running behavior of strong coupling constant for any processes via a process - independent and systematic way , cf . a recent review on qcd scale setting  @xcite .    to compare with the conventional scale setting , it has been suggested by stevenson at 1981 that one can achieve a good prediction for an observable by requiring its pqcd approximant to be minimum sensitive to the variations of those unphysical parameters .",
    "this treatment is called as the  principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms ) \"  @xcite .",
    "the pms admits that different scheme and scale choices do lead to theoretical uncertainties , however the  true \" prediction of an observable can only be achieved by using optimal scheme and scale .",
    "the scheme dependence of the pms predictions have been analyzed in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is noted that the pms satisfies local rg - invariance  @xcite , which provides a practical approach to systematically fix the optimal scheme and scale for high - energy process .",
    "it has been noted that after applying the pms , the pqcd prediction does show a fast steady behavior over the scheme and scale changes . as an example",
    ", it has been applied to study the fixed - point behavior of the coupling constant at the low - energy region  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has also been observed that pms does not satisfy the rg - properties such as symmetry , reflexivity , and transitivity  @xcite .",
    "so the relations among different physical observables depend on the choice of intermediate renormalization scheme , leading to residual scheme dependence .",
    "moreover , the predicted pms scale for three - jet production via @xmath3-annihilation can not yield correct physical behavior at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) level , i.e. it anomalously rises without bound for small jet energy  @xcite .",
    "there are even doubts on the usefulness of pms  @xcite .",
    "all those discussions indicate the necessity of further careful studies on theoretical principles underlying the pms and on applications to more high - loop examples .",
    "great improvements on understanding the pms procedures and on applying pms scale setting to higher perturbative orders other than the nlo level have recently been achieved in ref.@xcite . in recent years",
    ", there are many progresses on studying the two - loop and higher qcd corrections . for examples ,",
    "the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been calculated up to four - loop level under the @xmath6-scheme  @xcite . with all those developments ,",
    "it is possible to make a detailed discussion on general properties of pms , and to show to what degree it can be applied . for the purpose",
    ", we shall present the pms predictions for @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 up to four - loop level .",
    "general pms properties , such as the accuracy of the pqcd prediction , the convergence of the perturbative series , the predictive power of pqcd theory and etc , shall be discussed via comparing the predictions with those under the conventional scale setting .    recently , another well - known scale setting approach , i.e. the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie approach suggested by brodsky etal . at 1983",
    "@xcite , has been developed into a fundamental one , i.e. the  principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) \"  @xcite . in different to pms scale setting , the pmc states that we should determine different optimal scales for the high - energy process under different schemes , and the final predictions are independent on the scheme choices due to commensurate scale relations  @xcite and also the scheme - independence of a conformal series .",
    "the running behavior of the coupling constant is governed by the rg - equation  @xcite .",
    "inversely , the pmc states the optimal behavior / scale of the coupling constant can be achieved by using the @xmath7-terms in perturbative series .",
    "the pmc follows standard rg - invariance and satisfies all rg - properties  @xcite .",
    "when one applies the pmc , the scales of the coupling constant are shifted at each order such that no contributions proportional to the qcd @xmath7-function remain .",
    "the resulting pqcd series is thus identical to a scheme - independent conformal series . since the resulting series is free of divergent renormalon terms  @xcite",
    ", the pqcd convergence can be naturally improved .",
    "the pms and pmc scale settings have quite different starting points and their predictions usually have quite different perturbative nature , it is thus helpful to present a detailed comparison of the pms predictions with the pmc ones .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.[sec : pms ] we first present a short review on local rg - invariance that underlies pms , then , we present the pms formulas up to high - perturbative orders . a tricky way to derive the pms rg - invariants at high - orders in the appendix . in sec.[sec : app ] we investigate the pms properties based on three quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 up to four - loop level . in sec.[sec : vs ] we present a detailed comparison of pms and pmc via the quantity @xmath0 .",

    "the calculation of the coefficients @xmath28 involves ultraviolet divergences which must be regulated and removed by a renormalization procedure . at the finite order , the pqcd predictions dependent on the choice of renormalization scheme and scale , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the scheme or scale parameter , respectively .",
    "eq.([pmsfinite ] ) shows the self - consistency of a perturbation theory , i.e. the @xmath31-lo approximate @xmath32 must agree to @xmath33 under different choices of scheme and scale .",

    ", there are renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities for the fixed - order pqcd approximant @xmath32 .",
    "the pms suggests to eliminate such scheme and scale ambiguities by finding optimal scheme and optimal scale of the process , which can be achieved by requiring @xmath32 to satisfy the following equations  @xcite , @xmath38 they can be further written as    @xmath39 ^ 2 } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial ( a_s/4 ) } \\right)\\varrho_n=0 , \\;\\;\\ ; ( m=2,3 , ... ) \\label{finite - sch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the integration in the second equations can be treated via the @xmath40-expansion ,    @xmath41 ^ 2 } = -\\frac{\\left(a_{\\rm s}/4\\right)^{j+1}}{\\beta_0 } \\left(\\frac{1}{j-1}-\\frac{\\beta_1}{\\beta_0 } \\frac{j-2}{j(j-1 ) } \\left(\\frac{a_{\\rm s}}{4}\\right)+\\dots\\right).\\ ] ]    the standard rg - invariance states that only the physical observable @xmath42 agrees with those equations .",
    "thus , using eqs.([finite - sca],[finite - sch ] ) for the fixed - order approximant is theoretically unsound , and they instead introduce a kind of local rg - invariance  @xcite .",

    "the pms , however , provides an intuitive way to set the optimal scheme and optimal scale , and its resultant tends to be steady over the scheme and scale changes around the optimal point .",

    "<S> as one of the key components of perturbative qcd theory , it is helpful to find a systematic and reliable way to set the renormalization scale for a high - energy process . the conventional treatment is to take a typical momentum as the renormalization scale , which assigns an arbitrary range and an arbitrary systematic error to pqcd predictions , leading to the well - known renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities . as a practical solution for such scale setting problem , the `` principle of minimum sensitivity '' ( pms ) , has been proposed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the pms suggests to determine an optimal scale for the pqcd approximant of an observable by requiring its slope over the scheme and scale changes to vanish . in the paper , we present a detailed discussion on general properties of pms by utilizing three quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 up to four - loop qcd corrections . after applying the pms , the accuracy of pqcd prediction , the pqcd convergence , the pqcd predictive power and etc . , have been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we compare pms with another fundamental scale setting approach , i.e. the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pmc is theoretically sound , which follows the renormalization group equation to determine the running behavior of coupling constant and satisfies the standard renormalization group invariance . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that pms does provide a practical way to set the effective scale for high - energy process , and the pms prediction agrees with the pmc one by including enough high - order qcd corrections , both of which shall be more accurate than the prediction under the conventional scale setting . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pms pqcd convergence is an accidental , which usually fails to achieve a correct prediction of unknown high - order contributions with next - to - leading order qcd correction only , i.e. it is always far from the  true \" values predicted by including more high - order contributions . </S>"
