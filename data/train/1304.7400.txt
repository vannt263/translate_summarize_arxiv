    "the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb , hereafter ) anisotropies provided by the planck satellite @xcite are in excellent agreement with expectations of the standard @xmath17cdm cosmological model and present the tightest ever constraints on its parameters .",
    "these new observations open the opportunity to further test some of the assumptions of the @xmath17cdm model and to possibly identify the presence of new physics .    following this line of investigation and previous analyses ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in this paper we test some properties of the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb , hereafter ) .",
    "it is well known that , apart from cmb photons , the standard cosmological model predicts the existence of a cnb of energy density ( when neutrinos are relativistic ) of    @xmath18 \\rho_{\\gamma}\\,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the photon energy density for @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom .    in the past years , cosmological data increasingly constrained the value of @xmath21 , ruling out the possibility of @xmath22 at high significance ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , the @xmath2 experiment @xcite reported the bound @xmath23 at @xmath24 c.l .",
    ", consistent in between two standard deviations with the standard value @xmath25 and providing evidence for the neutrino background at the level of about nine standard deviations .",
    "however , the slightly higher value for @xmath21 suggests that new physics can be present in the neutrino sector .",
    "this new physics could also be connected with the lensing amplitude of the temperature power spectrum .",
    "let us remind here that gravitational lensing acts on the cmb by deflecting the photon path by a quantity defined by the gradient of the lensing potential @xmath26 , integrated along the line of sight @xmath27 .",
    "lensing also affects the power spectrum by smoothing the acoustic peaks and this effect can be parameterized by introducing the lensing amplitude parameter @xmath7 , as defined in @xcite , which performs a rescaling of the lensing potential @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the power spectrum of the lensing field .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath2 data suggest an anomalous value for the lensing amplitude of @xmath30 at @xmath24 c.l . ,",
    "i.e. higher respect to the expected value of @xmath31 at about two standard deviations .    allowing a simultaneous variation in @xmath21 and @xmath7",
    ", we recently found @xmath32 and @xmath33 at @xmath24 c.l . in @xcite , suggesting the presence of some anomalies at higher significance .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our search for anomalies but considering a different modification to the cnb",
    ". indeed , instead of varying the neutrino effective number , which we fix at @xmath25 , we modify the cnb clustering properties as first proposed in @xcite . following @xcite",
    ", the cnb can be modelled as a generalized dark matter ( gdm ) component with a set of equations , describing the evolution of perturbations , given by ( @xcite ) :    @xmath34    where @xmath0 is the sound speed in the cnb rest frame , describing pressure fluctuations respect to density perturbations , and @xmath1 is the `` viscosity '' parameter which parameterizes the anisotropic stress . for standard neutrinos ,",
    "we have @xmath3 . constraints on these parameters have been set by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , since the observation of deviations from the standard values could hint at non - standard physics .",
    "using cosmological data previous to @xmath2 , smith @xmath35 @xmath36 @xcite found that , assuming @xmath25 , the case @xmath3 is ruled out at the level of two standard deviations .",
    "more recently , archidiacono @xmath35 @xmath36 @xcite found that current cosmological data from the south pole telescope spt @xcite exclude the standard value of @xmath37 at @xmath38 level , pointing towards a lower value .",
    "it is therefore extremely timely to bound the values of the neutrino perturbation parameters using the recent @xmath2 data .",
    "here we provide those new constraints but also considering the possible degeneracies between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the temperature power spectrum lensing amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section is devoted to the description of the analysis method ; our results are summarized in section iii ; conclusions are drawn in section iv .",

    "we show our results in tab.[tab : paramswp ] , tab.[tab : paramsex ] and tab.[tab : paramsl ] in the form of the @xmath5 confidence level , _ i_.e . ,",
    "the interval containing @xmath5 of the total posterior probability centered on the mean .    as we can see from tab.[tab : paramswp ] , fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] and fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] ( upper left panels ) , allowing both @xmath0 and @xmath1 to vary produces posterior values in disagreement with the standard model .",
    "in particular , the constraints on @xmath1 point towards a value larger than @xmath39 , being @xmath4 at @xmath5 c.l .",
    ", in tension with the standard value at about @xmath40 standard deviations .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 assumes in our analysis a value lower than the expected one : @xmath6 at @xmath5 c.l .",
    ", ruling out the standard value at more than @xmath41 c.l .. the addition of bao and hst datasets only results in an improvement of the constraining power ( tab.[tab : paramsex ] and upper right panel in fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] and fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] ) .",
    "the situation is significantly different when the lensing amplitude parameter is allowed to vary ( see tab.[tab : paramswp ] , upper right panels in fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] , fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] and fig.[fig : alens_1d ] ) . in the @xmath42 case , the standard value of the viscosity parameter is recovered ( @xmath43 ) ; similarly , in the @xmath44 case , @xmath0 is in agreement with the expected value ( @xmath45 ) . however , though the @xmath31 case is now in more agreement with the data , it is still in disagreement with the standard value at more than @xmath46 level ( respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , showing a degeneracy between @xmath7 and the clustering parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig : ceffalens_2d ] and fig.[fig : cvisalens_2d ] ) .",
    "also for these choices of parameters , the addition of bao and hst allows to get tighter constraints as well ( tab.[tab : paramsex ] and upper right panel in fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] and fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] ) .    finally , when all the three parameters are allowed to vary , their posteriors are in good agreement ( within @xmath46 c.l . ) with the standard model : we find @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", the addition of bao and hst datasets slightly affects the peak location in the posterior distributions ( see tab.[tab : paramsex ] , upper right panels in fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] , fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] and fig.[fig : alens_1d ] ) .",
    "in particular , it produces a @xmath49 displacement of the @xmath1 mean towards a smaller ( therefore more compatible with the expected ) value .",
    "conversely , it results in a @xmath50 shift of the @xmath7 mean towards a higher value ( less compatible with the expected , but more compatible with the @xmath2 collaboration finding ) .",
    "on the other hand , the magnitude of the displacement induced on the @xmath0 distribution ( towards the expected value ) is minimal ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath52 dataset are summarized in tab.[tab : paramsl ] .",
    "the addition of the lensing power spectrum alleviates the disagreement respect to the standard values for the neutrino parameters ( lower panels in fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] , fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] and fig.[fig : alens_1d ] ) .",
    "the greatest effect concerns the @xmath53 model , since we find @xmath54 and @xmath55 at 68% c.l .. as we can see from fig.[fig : ceff_1d ] and fig.[fig : cvis_1d ] , allowing the lensing amplitude to vary produces a further shift towards the expected values in the standard scenario : @xmath56 is compatible within 68% c.l .. finally , as far as the lensing amplitude is concerned , the addition of the lensing power spectrum results in a better agreement with the expected value , especially when all the three parameters vary jointly ( @xmath57 ) .      as we can see from tab.[tab : paramswp ] , tab.[tab : paramsex ] and tab.[tab : paramsl ] , varying the neutrino parameters also results in pronounced variations in other cosmologcal parameters , in particular the scalar spectral index @xmath58 and the scalar amplitude @xmath59 . a similar analysis has been performed in @xcite considering just the   viscosity  @xmath1 . here , we would like to show the degeneracies between both the clustering parameters and the inflationary parameters , updated to more recent cosmological measurements .",
    "we report the two - dimensional posterior probabilities for the @xmath60 dataset only .",
    "the conclusions are equivalent for the remaining two datasets . as we can see from fig.[fig : ns ] and fig.[fig : loga ] , there is a negative ( positive ) correlation between @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and the inflationary parameters . when the lensing amplitude varies together with one of the clustering parameters , the contours center at the standard value @xmath56 . however , while the choice of the model does not affect the direction of the degeneracy for @xmath1 , the @xmath61 model partly removes the degeneracy for @xmath0 .",
