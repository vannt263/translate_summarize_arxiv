    "in every major scenario for physics above the @xmath1 scale non - perturbative chiral gauge theory dynamics is expected to play an important role , yet our understanding of this dynamics is very limited .",
    "recently we proposed a non - perturbative formulation of chiral gauge theory on the lattice , in the hope that the important features of these theories will be calculable in future computer simulations @xcite .",
    "we briefly review it here , focussing on a lattice gauge field interpolation procedure which is the crucial feature of our construction .",
    "the fermions are taken to live on a euclidean lattice with spacing @xmath2 .",
    "fermion doublers are eliminated by the rome group method of using a gauge non - invariant wilson term @xcite .",
    "( the nielsen - ninomiya theorem tells us that we must break chiral gauge invariance to eliminate the fermions doublers . )",
    "the central problem is then to recover gauge invariance in the continuum limit . before summing over gauge fields this",
    "can be arranged in a fairly simple way for any @xmath3-@xmath4 theory @xcite . however , once gauge fields are integrated over , new divergences can lead to uncontrollable violations of gauge invariance .",
    "a solution to this problem is to cut off the gauge field momenta by a scale @xmath5 ( @xmath6 in the continuum limit . )",
    "@xcite gives detailed lattice power - counting arguments to show that this can be achieved by obtaining the @xmath2-lattice gauge fields as an interpolation of gauge fields living on a lattice of spacing @xmath7 , which are summed over using the standard wilson action .",
    "in practice it is possible that @xmath8 may not have to be too large for computing the properties of low - lying states @xcite .",
    "( for another possible way of cutting off gauge field momenta see ref . @xcite . )",
    "it is sufficient for the interpolation procedure to satisfy the following properties @xcite , most easily stated by imagining interpolating the @xmath9-lattice link variables , @xmath10 , all the way to the continuum to give gauge fields , @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "( i ) transverse continuity : the interpolation describes a differentiable continuum gauge field @xmath12 each @xmath9-lattice hypercube , whose transverse components are continuous across hypercube boundaries ( the longitudinal components can jump ) .",
    "( ii ) lattice spacetime symmetries should be respected .",
    "( iii ) gauge covariance : a @xmath9-lattice gauge transformation changes the interpolation only by a continuous gauge transformation .",
    "( iv ) locality : the gauge - invariant behavior of the interpolation should depend locally on @xmath10 , in particular it is sufficient if the trace of any continuum wilson loop depends only on the @xmath10 lying on @xmath9-hypercubes through which the wilson loop passes .",
    "we have detailed such an interpolation procedure for non - abelian gauge fields in four dimensions in ref .",
    "below , we describe the more transparent case of interpolating @xmath0 gauge fields in @xmath13 dimensions , following a procedure which readily generalizes to the non - abelian case . for simplicity",
    "we deal with the case @xmath14 ( the continuum ) and work in units where @xmath15 .",
    "in order to maintain transverse continuity it is helpful to build the interpolation from the lowest dimensional sublattices up .",
    "we therefore begin by interpolating the link variables , @xmath16 along the points of each plaquette edge .",
    "( we are neglecting the measure - zero set of lattice fields where at least one of the link variables equals exactly @xmath17 . )",
    "the simplest such interpolation is @xmath18 note that parallel transport along the links agrees between the lattice and the continuum fields .",
    "we now @xmath19 to interpolate the lattice field into a plaquette interior in such a way as to agree with the above interpolation on the plaquette edges . in order",
    "to satisfy locality we try to do this interpolation for each plaquette , using as input only its bounding link variables . in order to satisfy gauge covariance",
    "the strategy is to do a @xmath20 gauge transformation on the bounding links of the plaquette which put the link variables into a complete axial gauge .",
    "thus all gauge equivalent lattice fields on the plaquette edges are taken to the same gauge - fixed field ( ` almost ' the same in the non - abelian case ) , which we denote by @xmath21 .",
    "this lattice configuration will then be smoothly interpolated to the plaquette interior to give a continuum field @xmath22 .",
    "we will then try to find a smooth gauge transformation inside the plaquette which makes the result agree with the one - dimensional edge interpolation , eq .",
    "( 2 ) . at this last stage we will fail , but in a way which we can understand and then correct .    in detail , let us fix some plaquette and use @xmath23 coordinates @xmath24 for the vertices of the plaquette .",
    "the lattice gauge transformation , @xmath25(z ) = u_1(s)^{z_1 } u_2(s + z_1 \\hat{1})^{z_2},\\ ] ] takes @xmath26 to @xmath27 this lattice field is easily interpolated into the plaquette interior , @xmath28 where @xmath29 are local continuum coordinates for the plaquette interior .",
    "the problem is now to find a @xmath30 gauge transformation @xmath31 which takes @xmath22 to a gauge field agreeing with eq .",
    "( 2 ) , so that we can be assured of transverse continuity across plaquette boundaries .",
    "in fact it is not hard to see that this demand essentially fixes @xmath31 on the plaquette boundary to be @xmath32 thereby specifying a map from the plaquette boundary ( topologically a circle ) to @xmath0 ( topologically also a circle ) .",
    "we can therefore associate a topological winding number ( integer ) to this map for each plaquette .",
    "unless this winding is zero , @xmath31 can not be continuously extended from the plaquette boundary to the interior , and we are stuck .",
    "it is simple to show that the winding number associated to the plaquette at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , is equal to @xmath35,\\ ] ] ( @xmath36 \\equiv$ ] nearest integer to @xmath37 ) and is generically non - zero .",
    "the way out of this impasse is to generalize the edge interpolation to @xmath38 where the @xmath39 are integer - valued and do not affect agreement of parallel transport between the link variables and the interpolation .",
    "( in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath40 . )",
    "if these integers are chosen to satisfy @xmath41 it is easy to show that this new definition differs from the original by a gauge transformation defined on the plaquette boundary with winding number @xmath42 .",
    "therefore the gauge transformation which makes @xmath22 agree with eq .",
    "( 9 ) , @xmath43 , has winding number zero and can be smoothly extended to the plaquette interior , allowing us to get an interpolation @xmath44 . a simple choice for this extension of @xmath43 yields for @xmath45 , @xmath46    if @xmath47 then in fact there is no consistent solution to eq . ( 9 )",
    "the reason is that the boundary conditions for the interpolation then correspond to a continuum configuration with topological charge @xmath47 , which can not be represented by a single smooth periodic gauge field .",
    "while configurations with non - zero topological charge are physically important , we do not need them in our proposal for lattice chiral gauge theory , because their effects can be inferred from the sector with zero topological charge using cluster decompostion for the full theory . for @xmath48 eq .",
    "( 9 ) has many solutions and it is simple to pick one @xcite .    let us check the four central requirements for a successful interpolation .",
    "( i ) it is straightforward to see that eq . (",
    "10 ) defines a transversely continuous gauge field . ( ii ) even though we had to pick the axes of our complete gauge fixing somehow , the @xmath49-@xmath50 behavior of our interpolation is covariant under lattice translations and rotations , though the gauge dependent form is not . to see this in the @xmath0 case is easy , since from eqs .",
    "( 10 , 9 ) the continuum field strength is a constant in each plaquette and is just the logarithm of the plaquette field strength ( with absolute value less than @xmath51 ) .",
    "for the same reason ( iii ) and ( iv ) are also obvious , the non - locality in choosing the @xmath52 does not infect the gauge invariant part of the interpolation ( ie .",
    "the field strength for the @xmath0 case ) .      while non - abelian interpolation in four dimensions is technically more complicated , the basic steps are the same . the topological obstruction to making higher dimensional interpolations agree with lower dimensional ones now occurs in four dimensions , because the smallest non - abelian group , @xmath53 , is topologically the 3-sphere as is a hypercube boundary .",
    "the resolution of the problem generalizes the 2-d @xmath0 case .",
    "one extra complication not seen in two dimensions is that the choice of axes for the complete gauge fixing ( important for maintaining gauge covariance ) @xmath54 lead to a breaking of lattice rotational covariance in the gauge - invariant behavior of the interpolation . to repair",
    "this one needs to allow the orientation of the axes in each hypercube to be different and to determine this orientation by the gauge - invariant behavior of the link field @xmath10 itself .",
    "then if @xmath10 is rotated , so do the axes .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the interpolation in ref .",
    "@xcite differs in that the authors directly interpolate @xmath31 instead of @xmath43 , thus getting singular gauge fields whenever any @xmath34 is non - zero .",
    "such singular gauge fields are unsuitable for our formulation of chiral gauge theories .",
    "their interpolation also breaks lattice rotational covariance in the non - abelian case",
