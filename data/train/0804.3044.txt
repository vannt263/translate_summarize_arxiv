    "the c iv and mg ii quasi - stellar object ( qso ) absorption systems or absorbers appear to trace the same structure as that of galaxies on very large scales and have been shown to be effective probes of large - scale structure in the universe @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion on the connection between galaxies and qso absorbers using observations at low redshift .",
    "the clustering of such absorbers were studied in a series of investigations @xcite using an extensive catalog of absorbers drawn from the literature . specifically , they performed a second - order correlation analysis in one dimension , restricting to absorber pairs lying on the same qso lines of sight , and found clustering on very large scales , up to 50 to 100 @xmath2mpc .",
    "this superclustering has also been found in other studies , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this work on the second - order clustering of absorbers complements the analyses of second - order structure of other astronomical objects such as galaxies , quasars and the cosmic microwave background .    in astronomy ,",
    "a common measure of second - order structure is the two - point correlation function @xmath3 @xcite , and this is the function used in the above - mentioned studies .",
    "another measure of second - order clustering is the reduced second moment function , also called ripley s @xmath1 function @xcite . in three dimensions , the @xmath1 function is related to the two - point correlation function by @xmath4 \\",
    ", du.\\ ] ] @xcite applied the @xmath1 function to galaxy surveys , while @xcite used it to examine clustering of the @xcite c iv absorber catalog .",
    "@xcite extended the work of @xcite in the study of second - order clustering of the @xcite absorber catalog by considering the absorbers as a process occurring in three dimensions . by treating the absorbers as a three - dimensional process",
    ", absorber pairs that lie on different lines of sight were included in estimates of the @xmath1 function . as a result",
    ", the estimates obtained were shown to have dramatically smaller standard errors than estimates obtained by only considering the absorbers as a one - dimensional process on the lines of sight , when there is a large enough number of lines of sight .",
    "more recently , there has been interest in higher - order clustering , in particular in third - order clustering , partly because of limitations of restricting to second moments and partly because datasets are now large enough for third - order statistics to be estimated . in particular , the structure of filaments and voids that is present in galaxy surveys is more readily , though still inadequately , described by third - order statistics @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for some examples of the three - point correlation function @xcite applied to galaxy surveys .",
    "the @xcite absorber catalog , which has 276 lines of sight and 345 c iv absorbers , is too small for investigating third - order structure , but the catalog being gathered by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite will have many more absorbers and lines of sight , making a study of the third - order structure of absorbers feasible .    here , we are concerned with estimating the third - order structure of an absorber catalog . with estimates describing the third - order structure of an absorber catalog , one can compare these estimates with corresponding estimates from galaxy surveys .",
    "for example , one can study whether absorbers lie along filaments like galaxies do .",
    "in section [ sect : thirdmoment ] we will define a third - order version of the @xmath1 function and relate it to the three - point correlation function . we provide edge correction weights for its estimation for an absorber catalog .",
    "we provide mathematical details in the appendix and results of a simulation study ( section [ sect : sim ] ) to show that these weights do properly account for the edge effects .",
    "since these weights make use of the weights found in @xcite , we briefly summarize their method of finding correction weights ( section [ sect : abssecond ] ) .",
    "section [ sect : conclusion ] contains a brief summary and discussion of the application of this work for studying galaxy clustering and large - scale structure .",
    "here we briefly describe the method of @xcite for finding correction weights for estimating the @xmath1 function from an absorber catalog .",
    "figure [ fig : pair ] is a schematic diagram that shows absorbers lying on some lines of sight .",
    "the solid lines represent lines of sight , and the solid circles , absorbers at @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed circles represent a shell centered at @xmath5 with radius @xmath7 and thickness @xmath8 , which we will denote by @xmath9 to represent locations of absorbers on @xmath10 and @xmath11 to refer to general locations on @xmath10 which may or may not have absorbers present .",
    "the two shaded rectangles on this shell represent cylinders in three - dimensional space .",
    "if the center of the absorber @xmath6 lies in a cylinder , it will be observed on the line of sight that passes through the center of that cylinder .",
    "when the absorber at @xmath5 is at the center , the contribution of the absorber at @xmath6 to the estimate of @xmath1 needs to be corrected for boundary effects , i.e.  for the points in the shell @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the set of points in @xmath14 lies on , and the line joining point @xmath15 and absorber @xmath5 . in figure",
    "[ fig : pair ] , @xmath13 just consists of the points @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "the angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 are also indicated in figure [ fig : pair ] .",
    "the variable @xmath19 is the radius of an absorber in comoving units , and we assume it to be unknown , but fixed .",
    "the value of @xmath19 does not need to be specified because it gets cancelled away and does not appear in the estimator for @xmath1 . for more details , see section [ sect : thirdmoment ] where this cancellation also occurs for the estimator of the third - order statistic @xmath0 .    with weights specified by ( [ eqn:2ndorderwt ] ) , @xcite show that estimates for @xmath20",
    "are unbiased .",
    "it is well - known that second - order statistics do not completely describe the clustering properties of point processes .",
    "for example , @xcite provide an example of a non - poisson process with the @xmath1 function identical to that of a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "third- and higher - order statistics will allow a more detailed study of clustering than just second - order statistics .",
    "@xcite defined a three - point correlation function @xmath21 and applied it to the zwicky catalog . with three volume elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 that define a triangle with lengths @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xcite wrote the probability of finding an object in each of these elements as @xmath26dv_1dv_2dv_3 , \\label{eqn : threept}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the intensity or number density of the point process .",
    "subsequent studies using the three - point correlation function frequently used a different description of the configuration of triplets , employing two distance measures and one angle measure : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the angle between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "note that in the above notation the angle is subtended at the second point .",
    "we will use the parametrization of two distances and an angle in this work .    for the study of galaxy surveys , a related quantity @xmath32 , called the reduced three - point correlation function",
    "is often used , where @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{eqn : q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hierarchical form of ( [ eqn : q ] ) was proposed in @xcite based on their analyses of the lick and zwicky catalogs .",
    "it is an empirical form without theoretical support @xcite , but has been found to hold in other studies e.g.@xcite . in analyses of the 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy surveys , there appears to be variation of @xmath32 with @xmath29 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the statistics literature ,",
    "the quantity @xmath34 in ( [ eqn : threept ] ) above is more commonly expressed in terms of a function @xmath35 : @xmath36 where we have used two distances and an angle for the parameters of @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite refer to @xmath37 as the third - product density .",
    "@xcite also designed a third - order statistic to distinguish between certain classes of point process models , while @xcite used a third - order statistic to examine inner linearities in point patterns .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "these third - order statistics are integrated versions of the third - product density , and can be considered third - order versions of the second - order @xmath1 function . for our purposes , we define such a third - order function , which we denote by @xmath0 : @xmath38 , ( r_2,r_3 ] , \\omega ) & = & \\int_0^{r_1}\\!\\int_{r_2}^{r_3}\\!\\int_\\omega 4\\pi r_{12}^2 r_{23}^2 g^{(3)}(r_{12},r_{23 } , \\theta ) ( 2\\pi \\sin\\theta)d\\theta dr_{23}dr_{12 } , \\label{eqn : k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] denotes an interval that includes @xmath40 but not @xmath41 and @xmath42 , 0\\le \\alpha_1 < \\alpha_2 \\le \\pi$ ] is a range of angles .",
    "the third - order statistic of @xcite corresponds to @xmath0 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 , ( r_2,r_3 ] , \\omega)$ ] has an intuitive interpretation :  given a randomly chosen object at @xmath5 , @xmath46 , ( r_2,r_3 ] , \\omega)$ ] is the expected number of object pairs at @xmath6 and @xmath47 such that @xmath48 ,    @xmath6 and @xmath47 at @xmath5 , @xmath49 , is in @xmath50 . to relate to the notation in ( [ eqn : k ] ) , note that @xmath51 and latexmath:[$r_{23 } =     at which the angle is subtended .",
    "of particular interest is the case when @xmath29 is close to 0 or @xmath53 , since this describes the property of finding triplets of points that lie close to a line",
    ". we will also be interested in the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath50 .",
    "both the three - point and reduced three - point correlation functions can be obtained from @xmath0 .",
    "consider @xmath45 , ( 0,r_3 ] , \\omega)$ ] where @xmath50 is a small angle range , @xmath54 , say .",
    "then from ( [ eqn : k ] ) we have , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the solid angle formed by the part of the unit sphere that subtends an angle @xmath57 to the @xmath58-axis . using ( [ eqn : threept ] ) , ( [ eqn : q ] ) and ( [ eqn : g3 ] ) , @xmath21 and thus @xmath32 can be expressed in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore estimates for one quantity can be converted to estimates for the other quantities .",
    "there are different advantages to estimating @xmath0 versus @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath0 is an integral quantity , it is often smoother and thus its estimates might have better theoretical properties . it also separates the choice of bin size from the edge correction weights , so if a study of the effect of bin size or of different edge correction methods is desired , it may be more appropriate to use @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the hierarchical form of ( [ eqn : q ] ) is more simply expressed using @xmath21 and @xmath32 .",
    "having estimates of @xmath59 and @xmath32 allows for more flexibility in studying the clustering present in a dataset , so rather than advocating for one statistic over another , we recommend using all these statistics as tools for a detailed analysis .    when studying clustering of a point pattern observed in a finite region , it is important to account for the boundary of the observation region .",
    "if a point falls near a boundary , we do not get to observe all its neighboring points .",
    "this is a particularly important issue for an absorber catalog , since only a small portion of the three - dimensional space is probed by the lines of sight . in order to obtain unbiased estimates ,",
    "point pairs that are observed have to be reweighted to account for the boundary effect .",
    "there are various methods to do the edge correction",
    ". these can be numerical such as in the estimators of the two - point correlation function introduced by @xcite and @xcite , or analytical such as those introduced by @xcite and @xcite for the @xmath1 function .",
    "see @xcite for a good review in the astronomy context .",
    "@xcite found correction weights , based on the same correction procedure suggested by @xcite , for estimating the @xmath1 function for the @xcite c iv absorber catalog .",
    "@xcite found expressions of the correction weights based on ohser s and stoyan s correction methods @xcite . here , we obtain edge correction weights for estimating the third - order moment function @xmath0 using ripley s method",
    ".    note that since estimating a third - order statistic involves counting triplets of points , the more common analysis approach of treating the absorbers as a one - dimensional process on the lines of sight can not be used .",
    "the absorbers have to be treated as a three - dimensional process , and the edge effects caused by the large regions of unobserved space have to be accounted for .    for fixed values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we estimate @xmath0 by first estimating @xmath62 with @xmath63}(|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}|)1_{(r_2,r_3]}(|\\mathbf{z}-\\mathbf{x}| ) 1_\\omega(\\angle\\mathbf{yxz } ) \\omega_\\mathbf{x}(|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}|,|\\mathbf{z}-\\mathbf{x}|,\\omega ) v(|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}| , |\\mathbf{z}-\\mathbf{x}| , \\omega ) , & & \\label{eqn : estimator } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then dividing the estimate @xmath64 by an estimator of @xmath65 . here",

    "we find that with @xmath72 the estimator in ( [ eqn : estimator ] ) is unbiased for @xmath62 .",

    ", the denominator is the sum of the volumes of the cylinders associated with the intersection of @xmath75 with the set of lines of sight @xmath10 , less a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "these cylinders are shown in figure [ fig : pair ] and are shown again in the lower left portion of figure [ fig : triplet ] .    for ( [ eqn : w ] ) , we need to consider the intersections of @xmath76 with @xmath10 as well , represented by the outer shell in figure [ fig : triplet ] . like in ( [ eqn:2ndorderwt ] ) ,",
    "@xmath77 where @xmath78 is the sphere centered at @xmath5 with radius @xmath7 .",
    "the definition for @xmath79 is similar . with respect to figure [ fig : triplet ]",
    ", @xmath80 contains the locations @xmath16 and @xmath6 , while @xmath81 contains the locations @xmath82 and @xmath47 .    to get the denominator on the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : w ] ) , we consider pairs of cylinders , one on the outer shell and one on the inner shell , i.e.  a cylinder associated with a point @xmath83 in @xmath79 and another associated with a point @xmath15 in @xmath13 .",
    "each product of the volumes of these pairs of cylinders , equal to @xmath84 , is included in the sum only if the angle subtended at @xmath5 by the centers of the cylinder pair is in the range specified by @xmath50 , i.e.  if @xmath85 . in figure",
    "[ fig : triplet ] , these pairs are highlighted by rectangles that are similarly shaded .",
    "note that the @xmath86 term cancels because there is a corresponding term in the numerator of ( [ eqn : w ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the numerator of ( [ eqn : w ] ) has a form similar to the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : dk ] ) .",
    "there may be locations in @xmath10 that can not be a possible location for the absorber @xmath5 of a triplet @xmath87 of the desired configuration .",
    "which locations these are depend on the actual positions and lengths of the lines of sight in @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity @xmath88 in ( [ eqn : v ] ) accounts for this .",
    "each location @xmath89 is in the set @xmath90 if there are points @xmath91 such that @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the angle subtended by @xmath16 and @xmath82 at @xmath94 , @xmath95 , is in @xmath50 , i.e.   @xmath90 is just the set @xmath96 .",
    "so , by definition , @xmath5 of figure [ fig : triplet ] has to be in @xmath90 .    to get an estimate of @xmath0",
    ", we divide the estimator ( [ eqn : estimator ] ) by an estimate of @xmath65 , e.g.  @xmath97 .",
    "thus , although the expression for @xmath98 includes a @xmath99 term , the value of @xmath19 need not be specified when estimating @xmath0 since it gets cancelled away by the same term in the estimate of @xmath65 .",
    "the proof of unbiasedness is provided in the appendix .",
    "note that it is the estimator of @xmath62 that is unbiased .",
    "the estimate @xmath100 that is obtained by dividing by an estimate of @xmath65 may be slightly biased .",
    "such a property is called ratio - unbiasedness , and is a feature of estimators of the second - order @xmath1 function as well .",
    "we ran a simulation study to explore the performance of the estimator given in ( [ eqn : estimator ] ) , with weights given in ( [ eqn : w ] ) and ( [ eqn : v ] ) . note that distances referred to here are comoving distances .",
    "we first generated a set of 1000 lines of sight in a region similar to that to be probed by the qso lines of sight of the sdss catalog : a cone with half - angle of @xmath101 with earth at its tip , bounded by comoving distance @xmath102 mpc from earth .",
    "this range of distances corresponds to the comoving distances probed by qso lines of sight for mg ii and c iv absorbers under the einstein - de sitter cosmology .",
    "a thousand realizations of a poisson point process are then simulated on to these lines of sight , with density equal to that found in the @xcite catalog , 0.004 per @xmath2 mpc .",
    "we chose poisson processes since the theoretical value of @xmath0 is known for the poisson model : @xmath103,(r_2,r_3],\\omega ) = 4\\pi s(\\omega )   ( r_3 ^ 3-r_2 ^ 3)r_1 ^ 3/9 $ ] .",
    "for each realization , we estimate the third - order function @xmath0 .",
    "we then find the mean and variance of these estimates , and compare it with the theoretical poisson value @xmath104 .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : k3top3 ] and [ fig : k3top3byangle ] .",
    "figure [ fig : k3top3 ] shows the ratio of the mean estimates of @xmath105 , ( 250 , r ] , \\omega)$ ] to the expected poisson value , for @xmath106 ( top left ) , @xmath107 ( top right ) , @xmath108 ( bottom left ) and @xmath109 ( bottom right ) , plotted as a function of @xmath110 , for @xmath111 @xmath2 mpc ( solid lines ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the pointwise error , equal to two times the standard deviation of the 1000 estimates .",
    "notice that in each case , the true value of 1 lies within this band .",
    "furthermore the mean estimated value is very close to 1 for the smaller angle ranges , with a slight bias appearing with angles close to @xmath112 .",
    "we believe this is because the edge correction approximation becomes less accurate at angles close to @xmath112 .",
    "figure [ fig : k3top3byangle ] shows plots of the same ratio as a function of @xmath29 , the midpoint of @xmath50 , from @xmath113 to @xmath112 , for values of @xmath110 fixed at 260 , 280 , 300 and 320 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "the angular bin size used is @xmath114 .",
    "again , we find that the pointwise confidence band contains the true value 1 , with the mean value also close to 1 .",
    "these plots show the bias appearing as the angle is increased to @xmath112 , with this bias becoming slightly less as the range @xmath115 $ ] increases .",
    "we chose the distance 50 @xmath2 mpc for @xmath116 since it corresponds roughly to the scale of superclustering that has been detected @xcite . with the values of @xmath117 $ ] that we used , the ratio @xmath118 is then about 5 or 6 , close to the values considered in e.g.  @xcite , although the values of @xmath30 considered there are much smaller .",
    "we also considered values of 10 to 40 @xmath2 mpc for @xmath116 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the results for @xmath119 mpc , except with slightly larger standard errors .",
    "we also performed a simulation study using 10,000 lines of sight in the same region .",
    "the corresponding plots are similar to those of figures [ fig : k3top3 ] and [ fig : k3top3byangle ] , but with standard errors smaller by a factor of about 10 to 15 , i.e. roughly of the order of the increase in the number of lines of sight . for @xmath120 , standard errors dropped only by about a factor of 5 , however .",
    "this approximate relation between standard errors and the number of lines of sight is similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "measures of the third - order clustering of galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave background are useful for the additional information they provide over measures of second - order clustering .",
    "in particular , the filamentary structure that has been found in galaxy data is more readily described by third- and higher - order measures of clustering .",
    "recently , due to the availability of larger datasets and advances in computing , such study of higher - order clustering has been the subject of active research .",
    "it will be desirable to study the third - order clustering of absorption systems .",
    "absorbers are often detected at extreme comoving distances from the earth .",
    "since absorbers are believed to be due to gas clouds near galaxies , an analysis of the third - order clustering of absorbers can serve as a complementary analysis to that of large galaxy surveys , enabling comparison of the local filamentary structure to that of the early universe . studying the third - order structure of absorbers",
    "might also provide greater understanding of their nature .",
    "finally , absorption systems consist of non - luminous matter .",
    "understanding the clustering of absorbers can yield insight into the link between luminous and non - luminous matter in the universe .    in this paper ,",
    "we define a third - order moment function @xmath0 that is an integrated version of the three - point correlation function , much like the relation between the second - order ripley s @xmath1 function and the two - point correlation function .",
    "we provide expressions for the weights necessary to correct for the boundary effects so that this function can be estimated for an absorber catalog .",
    "our simulation study shows that the estimator gives correct results ( i.e.including correctly accounting for the boundary effects ) , at least for the theoretically simple poisson process .    studies on large - scale structure with galaxy surveys have shown the existence of structures of the order of 100 @xmath2 mpc in size @xcite . in analyses of second - order clustering of the las campanas and sdss surveys , @xcite and @xcite respectively found peaks on scales of around 100 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "@xcite also found evidence of superclustering on these scales in their analysis of c iv absorption systems .",
    "@xcite also found evidence of clustering up to 100 @xmath2 mpc and possibly beyond .",
    "studies on galaxy clustering have focused on smaller scales . @xcite and @xcite followed the example of @xcite , using @xmath30 from 1 to 10 @xmath2 mpc and @xmath118 between 1 and 4 , and studied the variation in the reduced three - point correlation function @xmath32 with angle .",
    "the choice of @xmath121 and @xmath50 for @xmath0 would thus depend on the aim of the analysis . for comparisons with the findings of e.g. @xcite",
    ", the focus will be to study the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath50 , with the distance measures close to the values used there .",
    "for studies on superclustering and large - scale structure , comoving distances of 100 @xmath2 mpc and beyond for one or both of @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be of interest .",
    "an initial study will probably use @xmath44 $ ] , studying clustering at various distances , followed by more detailed analyses with smaller angular ranges .",
    "we are not aware of any other work on estimating third - order clustering specifically for absorber catalogs .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a large enough catalog of absorbers to obtain meaningful estimates of the third - order function . with the much larger absorber catalog that is being collected by the sloan digital sky survey",
    ", a detailed study of the third - order clustering of absorbers will become feasible . from our simulation studies",
    ", we found that the standard errors of estimates of @xmath0 for an absorber catalog scale roughly on the order of the reciprocal of the number of lines of sight .",
    "this agrees with the findings of @xcite for standard errors of estimates of the @xmath1 function for absorber catalogs .",
    "thus we expect that with the sdss absorber catalog with approximately 50,000 lines of sight , the standard errors of the estimates of @xmath0 will be roughly a factor of 50 smaller than the standard errors found in our simulation study with 1000 lines of sight .",
    "the actual increase in precision for a particular absorber catalog will of course depend on factors such as the actual spatial locations of the lines of sight and the density of the observed absorbers .",

    "<S> the statistic @xmath0 can be considered a third - order version of the second - order ripley s @xmath1 function and allows one to study the abundance of various configurations of point triplets . in particular configurations consisting of point triplets that lie close to a straight line can be examined .    </S>",
    "<S> studying third - order clustering of absorbers requires consideration of the absorbers as a three - dimensional process , observed on quasi - stellar object ( qso ) lines of sight that extend radially in three - dimensional space from the earth . since most of this three - dimensional space is not probed by the lines of sight , edge corrections become important . </S>",
    "<S> we use an analytical form of edge correction weights and construct an estimator of the statistic @xmath0 for use with an absorber catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we show that with these weights , ratio - unbiased estimates of @xmath0 can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> results from a simulation study also verify unbiasedness and provide information on the decrease of standard errors with increasing number of lines of sight . </S>"
