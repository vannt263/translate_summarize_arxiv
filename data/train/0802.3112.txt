    "let @xmath0 be a standard brownian motion .",
    "it @xcite defined the multiple stochastic integral of a function @xmath1 , @xmath2 taking care to ensure that the diagonal sets , like @xmath3 , do not contribute at all .",
    "for this reason the integral has very good properties and is easy to work with .",
    "however , for a function of the form @xmath4 we have that , in general , @xmath5 that means the it multiple integral does not behave like the integral with respect to a product measure .",
    "many years later , hu and meyer @xcite introduced ( although they believed that this integral was already known @xcite , page 75 ) a multiple integral , @xmath6 , which followed the ordinary rules of multiple integration .",
    "they called it the multiple stratonovich integral .",
    "furthermore , hu and meyer stated the relationship between the it and stratonovich integrals , the celebrated hu ",
    "meyer formula , adding the contribution of the diagonals to the it integral : for a function @xmath7 symmetric with good properties , @xmath8}\\frac{n!}{(n-2j)!j!2^j } i_{n-2j } \\biggl(\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}_+^{j}}f(\\bolds\\cdot , t_1,t_1,t_2,t_2,\\ldots , t_{j},t_{j } ) \\,d t_{1}\\cdots d t_{j } \\biggr).\\ ] ] this formula is simple because the quadratic variation of the brownian motion is  @xmath9 , and the integral over coincidences of order three or superior are zero .",
    "following their ideas , sol and utzet @xcite proved a hu ",
    "meyer formula for the poisson process .",
    "again , in that case , the formula is relatively simple because the variations of any order of the process can always be written in terms of the poisson process and @xmath9 .    from another point of view , engel @xcite , working with a general process with independent increments , related the ( it ) multiple stochastic integral with the theory of vector valued measures , and masani @xcite , using also vector valued measures and starting from the wiener s original ideas , developed both the it and stratonovich integrals ( with respect to the brownian motion ) and proved many profound results .",
    "the vector measures approach is no simple matter ; engel s work covers 82 pages , and masani s covers 160 .",
    "an important and clarifying contribution was made by rota and wallstrom @xcite who used combinatorial techniques to show the features of the multiple stochastic integration .",
    "they did not really work with integrals , but with products of vector measures .",
    "however , the path towards a general theory of multiple stochastic integration had been laid .",
    "see also prez ",
    "abreu @xcite for an interesting generalization to hilbert space valued random measures .",
    "further , vershik and tsilevich @xcite , in a more algebraic context , constructed a fock factorization for a lvy process , and some important subspaces can be described through rota and wallstrom concepts .",
    "we should also mention the very complete survey by peccati and taqqu @xcite in which a unified study of multiple integrals , moments , cumulants and diagram formulas , as well as applications to some new central limit theorems , is presented .",
    "it is worth remarking that rota and walstrom s @xcite combinatorial approach to multiple integration has been extended to the context of free probability in a very interesting and fertile field of research , started by anshelevich ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "in fact , rota and walstrom s ideas fit very well with the combinatorics of free probability ( see nica and speicher @xcite ) and noncommutative lvy processes .",
    "our renewed interest in rota and walstrom s paper @xcite was motivated by anshelevich s work .    in the present paper",
    "we use the powerful rota and wallstrom s @xcite combinatorial machinery to study the stratonovich integral ( the integral with respect to the product random measure ) with respect to a lvy processes with finite moments up to a convenient order .",
    "the key point is to understand how the product of stochastic measures works on the diagonal sets , and that leads to the diagonal measures defined by rota and wallstrom @xcite . for a lvy process",
    "those measures are related to the powers of the jumps of the process , and hence to a family of martingales introduced by nualart and schoutens @xcite , called teugels martingales , which offer excellent properties . specifically , these martingales have deterministic predictable quadratic variation and this makes it possible to easily construct an it multiple stochastic integral with respect to different integrators , which can be interpreted as an integral with respect to a random measure that gives zero mass to the diagonal sets . with all these ingredients",
    "we prove a general hu  meyer formula .",
    "the paper uses arduous combinatorics because of our need to work with stochastic multiple integrals with respect to the different powers of the jumps of the process , and such integrals can be conveniently handled through the lattice of the partitions of a finite set .    as in the brownian case",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , there are alternative methods to construct a multiple stratonovich integral based on approximation procedures , and it is possible to relax the conditions on the integrator process by assuming more regularity on the integrand function .",
    "such regularity is usually expressed in terms of the existence of _ traces _ of the function in a convenient sense .",
    "the advantage of using lvy processes with finite moments lies in the fact that simple @xmath10 estimates for the multiple stochastic integral of simple functions can be obtained , and then the multiple stratonovich integral can be defined in an @xmath11 space with respect to a measure that controls the behavior of the functions on the diagonal sets . in this way",
    ", the problem of providing a manageable definition of the traces is avoided .",
    "we would like to comment that an impressive body of work on multiple stochastic integrals with respect to lvy processes has been done by kallenberg , kwapien , krakowiak , rosinski , szulga , woyczinski and many others ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , their approach is very different from ours , and assumes different settings to those used in this work .",
    "for this reason , we have only used a few results by those authors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review some combinatorics concepts and the basics of the stochastic measures as vector valued measures . in section [ random ]",
    "we introduce the random measures induced by a lvy process , and we identify the diagonal measures in such a case . in section [ measure ]",
    "we study the relationship between the product and it measures of a set , and we obtain a hu  meyer formula for measures . in section",
    "[ integral ] we define the multiple it stochastic integral and the multiple stratonovich integral and also prove the general hu ",
    "meyer formula for integrals . in section [ sec6 ] , as particular cases",
    ", we deduce the classical hu ",
    "meyer formulas for the brownian motion and for the poisson process .",
    "we also study the case where the lvy process is a subordinator , and prove that both the multiple it stochastic integral and the multiple stratonovich integral can be computed in a pathwise sense .",
    "finally , in order to make the paper lighter , some of the combinatorial results are included as an .",
    "we need some notation of the combinatorics of the partitions of a finite set ; for details we refer to stanley @xcite , chapter 3 , or rota and wallstrom @xcite .",

    "a partition of @xmath12 is a family @xmath13 of nonvoid subsets of @xmath12 , pairwise disjoint , such that @xmath14 .",

    "this relationship defines a partial order that is called the _ reversed refinement order _ , and it makes @xmath16 a lattice .",
    "we write @xmath23 , which is the minimal element , and @xmath24 the maximal one .",
    "we say that a partition @xmath25 is of type @xmath26 if @xmath22 has exactly @xmath27 blocks with 1 element , exactly @xmath28 blocks with 2 elements , and so on . in the same way , for @xmath29 and @xmath30",
