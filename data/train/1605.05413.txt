    "the combined maxima-1 @xcite , boomerang @xcite dasi @xcite and cobe / dmr cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xcite and that most of the matter in the universe is dark @xcite , i.e. exotic .",
    "these results have been confirmed and improved by the recent wmap @xcite and planck @xcite data . combining the data of these quite precise measurements one finds : @xmath0 ( the more recent planck data yield a slightly different combination @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that both the wmap and the plank observations yield essentially the same value of @xmath2 , but they differ in the value of @xmath3 , namely @xmath4 ( wmap ) and @xmath5 ( planck ) . since any  invisible \" non exotic component can not possibly exceed @xmath6 of the above @xmath7  @xcite , exotic ( non baryonic ) matter is required and there is room for cold dark matter candidates or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) . + even though there exists firm indirect evidence for a halo of dark matter in galaxies from the observed rotational curves , see e.g. the review @xcite , it is essential to directly detect such matter in order to unravel the nature of the constituents of dark matter .",
    "the possibility of such detection , however , depends on the nature of the dark matter constituents and their interactions .",
    "the wimps are expected to have a velocity distribution with an average velocity which is close to the rotational velocity @xmath8 of the sun around the galaxy , i.e. they are completely non relativistic .",
    "in fact a maxwell - boltzmann leads to a maximum energy transfer which is close to the average wimp kinetic energy @xmath9 .",
    "thus for gev wimps this average is in the kev regime , not high enough to excite the nucleus , but sufficient to measure the nuclear recoil energy .",
    "for light dark matter particles in the mev region , which we will also call wimps , the average energy that can be transferred is in the few ev region .",
    "so this light wimps can be detected by measuring the electron recoil after the collision .",
    "electrons may of course be produced by heavy wimps after they collide with a heavy target which results in a shake up of the atom yielding `` primordial '' electron production @xcite .",
    "this approach for sufficiently heavy wimps and target nuclei can produce electrons energies even in the 30 kev region , with a spectrum very different from that arising after a direct wimp - electron collision .",
    "furthermore wimp - electron collisions involving wimps with masses in the few gev region have also recently appeared @xcite-@xcite . in the present work , however , we will restrict ourselves in the case of light wimps with a mass in the region of the electron mass .",
    "we will draw from the experience involving wimps in the gev region .",
    "the event rate for such a process can be computed from the following ingredients  @xcite :    * the elementary electron cross section . in this case",
    "we will consider the case of a scalar wimp , whose mass , as far as we know has not been constrained by any experiment , but it leads to mass dependent cross section favoring light particles .",
    "this scalar wimp couples with ordinary higgs with a quartic coupling , the properties of which are being actively determined by the lhc experiments .",
    "thus the wimp interacts with electrons via higgs exchange with an amplitude proportional to the electron @xmath10 . *",
    "the knowledge of the wimp particle density in our vicinity .",
    "this is extracted from wimp density in the neighborhood of the solar system , obtained from the rotation curves measurements .",
    "the number density of these mev wimps , however , is expected to be six orders of magnitude bigger than that of the standard wimps due to the smaller wimp mass involved . * the wimp velocity distribution . in the present work we will consider a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution .    in the electron recoil experiments , like the nuclear measurements first proposed more than 30 years ago @xcite ,",
    "one has to face the problem that the process of interest does not have a characteristic feature to distinguish it from the background .",
    "so since low counting rates are expected the background is a formidable problem .",
    "some special features of the wimp- interaction can be exploited to reduce the background problems , such as the modulation effect : this yields a periodic signal due to the motion of the earth around the sun . unfortunately this effect , also proposed a long time ago  @xcite and subsequently studied by many authors  @xcite , is small in the case of nuclear recoils , but we expect to be a bit larger in the case of the electron recoils .",
    "there has always been an interest in light wimps , see e.g. the recent work @xcite .",
    "in fact the first direct detection limits on sub - gev dark matter from xenon10 have recently been obtained @xcite .",
    "this is encouraging , but based on our experience with standard nuclear recoil experiments to excited states @xcite , one has to make sure that the proper kinematics has to be used in dealing with bound electrons .",
    "clearly the binding electron energy plays a similar role as the excitation energy of the nucleus , in determining the small fraction of the wimp s energy to be transferred to the recoiling system .",
    "it is therefore clear that light wimps are quite different in energy , mass , interacting particle , and flux .",
    "accordingly one needs detectors capable of detecting low energy light wimps in the midst of formidable backgrounds , i.e. detectors which are completely different from current wimp detectors employed for heavy wimp searches .    in the present paper",
    "we will address the implications of light scalar wimps on the expected event rates scattered off electrons .",
    "the interest in such a wimp has recently been revived due to a new scenario of dark matter production in bounce cosmology  @xcite in which the authors point out the possibility of using dark matter as a probe of a big bounce at the early stage of cosmic evolution .",
    "a model independent study of dark matter production in the contraction and expansion phases of the big bounce reveals a new venue for achieving the observed relic abundance in which dark matter was produced completely out of chemical equilibrium@xcite . in this way",
    ", this alternative route of dark matter production in bounce cosmology can be used to test the bounce cosmos hypothesis @xcite .    in any case",
    ", regardless of the validity of the big bounce universe scenario , the scalar wimps have the characteristic feature that the elementary cross section in their scattering off ordinary quarks or electrons is increasing as the wimps get lighter , which leads to an interesting experimental feature , namely it is expected to enhance the event rates at low wimp mass . in the present calculation we will adopt this view and study its implications in direct dark matter searches compared to other types of wimps , such as the neutralinos , which we will call standard wimps .",
    "scalar wimp s can occur in particle models .",
    "examples are i ) in kaluza - klein theories for models involving universal extra dimensions ( for applications to direct dark matter detection see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in such models",
    "the scalar wimps are characterized by ordinary couplings , but they are expected to be quite massive , ii ) extremely light particles  @xcite , which are not relevant to the ongoing wimp searches , iii ) scalar wimps such as those considered previously in various extensions of the standard model  @xcite , which can be quite light and long lived protected by a discrete symmetry .",
    "thus they are viable cold dark matter candidates .",
    "the wimp is assumed to be a scalar particle @xmath11 interacting with another scalar @xmath12 via a quartic coupling as discussed , e.g. in refs @xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "in fact the quartic coupling + + involving the scalar wimp @xmath11 and the higgs @xmath12 leads to a feynman diagram shown in fig . [",
    "fig : xxphiphiqe](a ) and results to a mass dependent nucleon cross section @xcite of the form : _",
    "p=_0(p ) , where @xmath13 depends on the quartic coupling @xmath14 and the quark structure of the nucleon . we will assume in this work that @xmath12 is the higgs scalar discovered at lhc and the quartic coupling entering our model is the same with that involving the higgs as has been determined by the lhc experiments .",
    "+     + @xmath15    in the case of light wimps with mass less than 100 mev one can not produce a detectable recoiling nucleus , but electrons  @xcite could be produced with energies in the ev region , which , in principle , could be detected with current mixed phase detectors  @xcite . if the wimp is a scalar particle , it can interact with electrons via the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xxphiphiqe](b ) . for wimps with mass in the range of the electron mass , both the wimp and the electron",
    "are not relativistic .",
    "so the expression for elementary electron cross section is similar to that of hadrons , i.e. it is now given by : _",
    "e= ( ) ^2=_0(e ) [ eq : sigmae ] with @xmath16 determined by the higgs particle discovered at lhc , namely @xmath17 , @xmath18 gev .",
    "one finds : _ 0(e)=8.0 10 ^ -9 , [ eq : sigmae0 ] this is a respectable size cross section , which depends on the ratio @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively one could fix @xmath20 by using the nucleon cross limit  @xcite extracted from experiments , e.g. @xmath21 pb from xenon100  @xcite , which leads to @xmath22 pb .",
    "we thus find _",
    "0(e)=_0(p ) 1.310 ^ -11 , which , if true , would imply a much smaller value for @xmath14 .",
    "anyway we will treat the value of @xmath23 as a parameter , which may be fixed if and when the experimental data become available .",
    "the obtained cross section is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmape ] .",
    "we note that this mass dependence of the cross section of scalar wimps results in a suppression of the cross section in the high wimp mass regime . in",
    "what follows we will write @xmath24 but it is understood that we mean @xmath23 .    before proceeding further with evaluation of the event rates in the case of light wimps it is instructive to review the experimental hurdles that must overcome to make their detection feasible .",
    "so far , we have discussed mainly some theoretical aspects of light wimps in the mev region and have presented theoretical calculations of the expected light wimp signals . here",
    "we briefly discuss experimental aspects of light wimp searches , which are very different compared with those of heavy wimp searches .",
    "light wimps are quite different in energy , mass , interacting particle , and flux .",
    "accordingly one needs detectors which are completely different from current wimp detectors for heavy wimps .",
    "detectors are required to observe low - energy light wimp signals beyond / among bg signals to identify the light wimps .",
    "experimental aspects to be considered for light wimp detectors are : i ) the particle to be detected , ii ) the event rate , iii ) the signal pulse height , iv ) the background rate and v ) the detector threshold energy",
    ". we will now examine each of these items .    * particle to be detected .",
    "+ light wimps are detected by observing a recoil / scattered electron in the continuum region . in case that the wimp interaction produces an ion - electron pair , one can detect the ion and/or the electron , and/or photons associated with the ion - electron pair .",
    "if the recoil electron or the ion - electron pair energy is absorbed by the detector , one may measure the temperature change .",
    "these are similar to those from heavy wimps except that their energies are very different .",
    "it is noted that atomic bound electrons are not excited by the light wimps with @xmath25 a few ev",
    ". * event rate .",
    "+ the cross section of @xmath26 pb is an order of magnitude larger than the present xenon limit of @xmath27 10@xmath28 pb for heavy wimps",
    "the flux rate is around @xmath29@xmath30s@xmath31 , which is larger by a factor of 50 gev/0.5 mev@xmath32 .",
    "then the event rate for xe detector is around @xmath33 /(t.y ) , which is an order of magnitude larger than the present limit for 50 gev heavy wimps @xcite .",
    "* signal pulse height .",
    "+ the electron signal energy for light wimps is around 0.5 - 1 ev .",
    "this energy is 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the xe nuclear recoil energy of around 25 kev for the 50 gev wimp .",
    "the nuclear recoil signal is quenched by a factor 2 - 20 , depending on the atomic number , in most heavy wimp detectors .",
    "thus the actual signal height for the light wimp is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that for the heavy wimp .",
    "* background rate + there are three types of background origins for wimp detectors , radioactive ( ri ) impurities , neutrons associated with cosmic rays , and electric noises . @xmath34 rays from ri impurities produce bg electron signals , which are similar to electron signals from light wimps as well as as those encountered in the case of double @xmath35 decay detectors , which measure @xmath36 rays . bg rate for a typical future dbd ( double @xmath35 decay ) detectors is around 1/(t y kev ) = 10@xmath37/(t y ev ) at a few mev region @xcite .",
    "then one may expect a similar bg rate in the ev region .",
    "this is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the signal rate .",
    "neutrons do not contribute to bgs in light wimp detectors , although nuclear recoils from neutron nuclear reactions are most serious bgs for heavy wimp detectors .",
    "+ electric noises are most serious for light wimp detectors because of the very low energy signals .",
    "the nuclear recoil energy from heavy wimps is typically a few 10 kev , and the signal pulse height is around a few kev if they are quenched , depending on the detector .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as electric noise levels .",
    "thus one can search for heavy wimps by measuring the higher velocity component above the electric noises on the other hand , the signal height for light wimp is far below that of typical electric noises for current heavy wimp detector .",
    "* energy threshold + the energy threshold @xmath38 for wimp detectors is set necessarily below the wimp signal , but just above the electric noise to be free from the noise .",
    "then a very low energy threshold of an order of sub ev is required for light wimp searches .",
    "this is 3 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the level around 1 - 3 kev for most heavy wimp detectors @xcite and @xcite .",
    "germanium semiconductor detectors are widely used to study low energy neutrinos and wimps .",
    "the ionization energy is 0.67 ev .",
    "thus it can be used in principle for energetic light wimps . in practice , their threshold of around 200 ev @xcite or more is still far above the light wimp signals .",
    "bolometers are , in principle , low energy threshold and high energy resolution detectors , but the energy threshold of practical 10 kg - scale bolometers are orders of magnitude higher than the light wimp signal .",
    "thus light wimp detectors are necessarily different types from the present heavy wimp detectors .",
    "+ it is indeed a challenge to develop light wimp detectors with low - threshold energy of the order of ev .",
    "since the event rate is as large as 2 10@xmath39/t y , one can use a small volume detector of the order of 10 kgr at low temperature .",
    "in general , electric noises are random in time . then , coincidence measurements of two signals are quite effective to reduce electric noise signals in case that one light wimp produces 2 or more signals",
    ". one possible detector would be an ionization- scintillation detector , where one light wimp interaction produces one ionized ion and one electron . in case that the ionized ion traps an electron nearby and emits a scintillation photon",
    ", one may measure the primary electron in coincidence with the scintillation photon .",
    "nuclear emulsion may be of potential interest for low energy electrons .",
    "we briefly discuss possible new detection methods in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the evaluation of the rate proceeds as in the case of the standard wimp - nucleon scattering , but we will give the essential ingredients here to establish notation .",
    "we will begin by examining the case of a free electron .",
    "since both the wimp and the electron are not relativistic one finds that the momentum transferred to the electron @xmath40 has a magnitude is given by @xmath41 the differential cross section is now given by : d=_02d,01 [ eq.difsigma ] from this , after integrating over @xmath42 , we obtain the total cross as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmae ] .",

    "away from this value it becomes smaller .",
    "the effect is more crucial for very light wimps , since their average energy is much smaller .",
    "we also find from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttransf ] ) that the average energy of the electron is given by = m_e c^2 , = ( ) ^2=0.8 10 ^ -6 [ eq : ttransev ] thus for mev wimps the average energy transfer is in the ev region , which is reminiscent of the standard wimps where gev mass leads to an energy transfer in the kev region .",
    "the maximum energy transfer corresponds to the escape velocity which is @xmath46 , which leads to a value four times higher .",
    "the exact expression of the maximum electron energy will be given below .",
    "it is preferable to rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq.difsigma ] in terms of the energy of the recoiling electron t and the wimp velocity using the relation given by eq .",

    "we thus find d=_0 dt [ eq.difsigma1 ] we also find that = _",
    "min= in other words the minimum velocity consistent with the energy transfer @xmath47 and the wimp mass is constrained as above .",
    "the maximum velocity allowed is determined by the velocity distribution and it will be indicated by @xmath48 . from this",
    "we can obtain the differential rate per electron in a given velocity volume @xmath49 as follows : dr=_0 dt f ( ) dd where @xmath50 is the velocity distribution of wimps in the laboratory frame . integrating over the allowed velocity distributions we obtain :",

    "+ before proceeding further we find it convenient to express the velocities in units of the sun s velocity .",
    "we should also take note of the fact the velocity distribution is given with respect to the center of the galaxy . for a m - b distribution",
    "this takes the form : e^- y^2,y^=,_0=220 we must transform it to the local coordinate system : ^+_s+ ( -+_s ) , = [ eq : vlocal ] with @xmath52 , @xmath53 a unit vector in the sun s direction of motion , @xmath54 a unit vector radially out of the galaxy in our position and @xmath55 . the last term in parenthesis in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vlocal ] ) corresponds to the motion of the earth around the sun with @xmath56 km / s being the modulus of the earth s velocity around the sun and @xmath57 the phase of the earth ( @xmath58 around june 3rd ) .",
    "the above formula assumes that the motion of both the sun around the galaxy and of the earth around the sun are uniformly circular .",
    "since @xmath59 is small , we can expand the distribution in powers of @xmath59 keeping terms up to linear in @xmath59 .",
    "then eq . [ eq : elrate1 ] can be cast in the form dr=()_0 1.910 ^ 6 dt ( _ 0(y_min)+ _ 1(y_min ) ) , [ eq : elrate2 ] where , in the above equation , the first term in parenthesis represents the average flux of wimps , the second provides the scale of the elementary cross section ( in the present model the elementary cross section contains an additional mass dependence ) , the third term gives the number of electrons available for the scattering in a target of mass @xmath60 containing atoms with mass number @xmath61 and active electrons @xmath62 and the fourth is essentially the inverse of the square of the sun s velocity in units of @xmath63 ( its origin has its root in eq .",

    "thus for @xmath156 one can conservatively @xmath70 to be @xmath157 , which leads to about 1 event per kg - y compared to the 3 per kg - y we got above for lighter wimps without the electron binding .",
    "the fermi function is incorporated into the results .",
    "we have seen that the use of electron detectors may be a good way to directly detect light wimps in the mev region .",
    "the electron density in our vicinity is very high , the elementary wimp - electron cross section section may be quite large and the event rate may be further enhanced by the behavior of the fermi function at low energies . with bound atomic electrons , however , there seems to be a problem , because a small fraction of electrons , @xmath158 , can be exploited , with @xmath62 being those electrons with binding energies below the 15 ev range .",
    "this is reminiscent of the difficulty encountered in the inelastic wimp nucleus scattering , whereby only very low excited states can be reached .",
    "we have seen that the expected rates for low energy electron recoils due to light wimps are sensitive to the fermi function corrections .",
    "in fact the inclusion of such corrections may increase the rate by factors of 8 for low energy electrons .",
    "so event rates of about 1 to 3 events per kg - y are possible .",
    "it has recently been suggested that it is possible to detect even very light wimps , much lighter than the electron , utilizing fermi - degenerate materials like superconductors@xcite . in this case",
    "the energy required is essentially the gap energy of about @xmath159 , which is in the mev region , i.e the electrons are essentially free .",
    "the authors are perhaps aware of the fact that not all the kinetic energy of the wimp can be transferred to the system . as we have seen",
    "the maximum fraction is approximately 1/3 and occurs if the mass of the wimp is equal to @xmath160 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttransfratio ] ) for @xmath45 .",
    "these authors probably have a way to circumvent the fact that a small amount of energy will be deposited , partly because a small fraction of energy of the wimp will be transferred to their system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : txtometransf ] ) and also because the average energy of the wimp is smaller .",
    "anyway , if they manage to accumulate a large number of electrons in their targets , the obtained rates maybe sufficient .",

    "the expected event rates and the total energy deposited in such essentially bolometer type detectors are currently being estimated more precisely and they will appear elsewhere .",
    "it thus appears that light wimps in the mev region can , in principle , be detected .",
