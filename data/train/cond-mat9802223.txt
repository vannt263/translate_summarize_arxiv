    "an interesting situation emerges when a system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition where the temporal correlation length diverges .",
    "this raises the question whether it is possible construct initial states that affect the _ entire _ temporal evolution of such systems .    to address this question , we consider the example of directed percolation ( dp ) which is the canonical universality class for nonequilibrium phase transitions from an active phase into an absorbing state  @xcite .",
    "dp is used as a model describing the spreading of some non - conserved agent and may be interpreted as a time - dependent stochastic process in which particles produce offspring and self - annihilate . depending on the rates for offspring production and self - annihilation such models display a continuous phase transition from a fluctuating active phase into an absorbing state without particles from where the system can not escape .",

    "these two cases seem to represent extremal situations where the average particle number either decreases or increases .",
    "a _ crossover _ between these two extremal cases takes place in a critical dp process that starts from a random initial condition at very low density . here",
