    "due to the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry in a lattice theory with wilson quarks a finite renormalization constant @xmath1 for the isovector axial current is needed so that ward identities take their canonical form up to small lattice corrections .",
    "otherwise a safe extrapolation to the continuum can not be achieved for physical quantities involving this current .",
    "the function @xmath2 @xcite currently used by the alpha collaboration was obtained by requiring that certain chiral ward identities are satisfied in the @xmath3 on  shell improved lattice theory up to @xmath4 cutoff effects .",
    "this normalization condition is evaluated at zero quark mass and hence the mass term in the pcac relation was dropped .",
    "however , even in the framework of the schrdinger functional simulations at vanishing quark mass are not possible if the physical volume , or equivalently the renormalized coupling , is too large . for the large couplings one",
    "therefore evaluates the normalization condition at finite quark mass and extrapolates to the chiral point .",
    "since the mass term was ignored in the derivation of the normalization condition this introduces an error of @xmath5 in @xmath1 .",
    "the sommer scale @xmath6  @xcite is used as a typical hadronic scale .    here",
    "we present a normalization condition for the axial current , which is derived using the full pcac relation .",
    "this reduces the @xmath5 errors in @xmath1 to @xmath7 and therefore results in a much flatter chiral extrapolation .",
    "by performing local infinitesimal symmetry transformations of the quark and anti ",
    "quark fields in the euclidean functional integral one derives the ward identities associated with the chiral symmetry of the continuum action . an axial transformation of the isospin doublet quark fields gives the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the variation of some operator @xmath10 .",

    "time region where the chiral transformation is applied .",
    "the axial current @xmath14 is inserted as an internal operator ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "if @xmath16 denotes a polynomial in the basic fields outside this region the integrated form of the axial current ward identity is @xmath17 the right  hand side of ( [ wi ] ) originates from the variation of the internal operator @xmath14 since under chiral transformation the axial current rotates into the vector current @xmath18 .",
    "a normalization condition for the axial current on the lattice is derived by demanding that eq .",
    "( [ wi ] ) in terms of the renormalized currents is still valid up to lattice artifacts for a given choice of @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "we use schrdinger functional boundary conditions in @xmath3-improved lattice qcd @xcite , i.e. we have an @xmath19 space  time cylinder with periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions and fixed ( dirichlet ) boundary condition in the temporal direction .",

    "we employ @xcite the normalization condition now gives a relation between a set of ( improved ) correlation functions on the lattice and the renormalization factor @xmath21 .",
    "if the mass is set to zero in ( [ wi ] ) with our choice for @xmath16 the lattice version of equation ( [ wi ] ) becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the correlator connecting the pseudo - scalar boundary states and @xmath24 is the correlation function corresponding to the surface integral in ( [ wi ] ) in terms of the improved lattice currents .",
    "if the mass term in the pcac relation ( [ pcac ] ) is not neglected one has to evaluate an additional correlation function @xmath25 corresponding to the second term in ( [ wi ] ) . for this correlator on ",
    "shell @xmath3 improvement breaks down due to contact terms .",
    "the normalization condition thus obtained is @xmath26 in the improved theory the normalization conditions ( [ normcon1 ] ) and ( [ normcon2 ] ) result in an intrinsic uncertainty of @xmath4 in @xmath1 .",
    "condition ( [ normcon1 ] ) will lead to an additional error of @xmath5 when evaluated at finite quark mass whereas ( [ normcon2 ] ) will lead to @xmath7 errors from the contact terms in the correlator multiplying the quark mass and also from @xmath27 , which we only know perturbatively .",
    "we choose the schrdinger functional setup with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and vanishing background field @xmath30 and evaluate the normalization conditions on @xmath31 quenched lattices with several different values of the hopping parameter .",
    "figure [ fig : beta8 ] shows the results from both normalization conditions as a function of the pcac mass for @xmath32 on the same set of lattices . in this case a simulation at the chiral point is possible in the schrdinger functional . as expected the quark mass dependence is strongly reduced when the new normalization condition is used .",

    "on closer inspection the reason for this larger error can be found by looking at the possible wick contractions for the correlation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the structure of the external operator used leads to disconnected quark diagrams where the two current insertions each couple to one temporal end of the lattice only .    those cause large statistical fluctuations especially in the volume correlator @xmath25 , which make the extraction of @xmath1 from the new normalization condition statistically more difficult .",
    "these diagrams can be suppressed by using a different external operator in the derivation of the normalization conditions .",
    "this operator requires the existence of a third quark species ( spectator ) and can therefore be used only as an approximation in a theory with @xmath35 .",

    "this work is also a preparation for an unquenched determination of @xmath1 . due to algorithmic problems at large values of the bare gauge coupling and small quark masses",
