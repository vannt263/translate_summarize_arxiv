    "in quenched lattice gauge theory , hadronic states are created by acting with light quark ( or anti - quark ) creation operators on the vacuum .",
    "the propagation of such a state in ( euclidean ) time then allows its mass to be determined .",
    "provided sufficiently large euclidean time @xmath0 is taken , the mass determination is independent of the particular hadronic creation operator used , since the ground state always dominates . in practice ,",
    "a limited range of @xmath0 is available , so methods are needed to create the hadronic ground state efficiently . for a study of hadronic matrix elements ,",
    "the requirements for an efficient hadronic operator are even stronger since off - diagonal terms involving excited states have to be removed .",
    "this has been a topic of much study  smearing the quark propagators has been used for example  @xcite .",
    "the main contamination of the ground state signal at larger @xmath0 values comes from the first excited state .",
    "so , effectively , one requires a hadronic creation operator which maximises the ground state relative to this first excited state .",
    "we study this explicitly by making simultaneous two - exponential fits to various hadron operators .",
    "this relative amplitude is usually called the bethe saltpeter ( or bs ) wave function of the hadron .",
    "it is the overlap between a quark and antiquark at distance @xmath1 apart and the hadronic state which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( transfer matrix on a lattice ) .",
    "we use a fuzzed gluon flux prescription  @xcite to join the quarks in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "this corresponds to the adiabatic wave function as defined by  @xcite .",
    "some previous work has used quark and antiquarks in the ( spatial ) coulomb gauge instead  @xcite .",
    "this is less efficient ( in our sense ) and also leads to problems with image sources in the spatial periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we construct non - local gauge - invariant operators using fuzzed links . in sec .",
    "3 we apply these ideas to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons and to baryons .",
    "we explicitly fit the correlation between hadronic operators at time separation @xmath0 using both ground state and excited states .",
    "details about the lattices and couplings are also given . in sec .",
    "4 we investigate the bs wave function obtained from the fit analysis .",
    "we show that the wave function has a node as a function of flux tube length , which points to the value of @xmath1 to be used for an efficient operator to create the ground state .",
    "the idea of applying gauge - invariant smearing techniques to the propagator at the source and/or sink to enhance the overlap with the ground state has been used extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "these methods rely on a smearing derived from a scalar massive particle propagating in the spatial dimensions only .",
    "there is no direct physical motivation for such an assumption , although it does work in practice .",
    "one clear motivation for a trial hadronic operator comes from consideration of the well - understood case of heavy - quark hadrons . for mesons ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states are approximately non - relativistic .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is also well justified , so that they can be modelled as heavy point particles ( quarks ) bound by a central potential @xmath6 between static colour sources ( in the fundamental colour representation ) . on a lattice ,",
    "efficient gluonic operators which create such a colour flux between static sources are known .",
    "these operators are constructed using a fuzzing algorithm , which can be implemented recursively  @xcite .",
    "this iterative fuzzing prescription creates gluonic fluxes with a dominant ground state and only a small admixture of excited states .",
    "this is the standard way to measure the potential energy @xmath6 accurately in lattice qcd . to extend this approach to lighter quarks",
    ", we then use such a lattice construction of a colour flux tube of length @xmath1 to join two light quarks in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "then we may vary @xmath1 and explore the relative amplitude of ground state and excited state hadron created .",
    "this method has already been explored  @xcite . here",
    "we construct fuzzed gluon flux tubes following exactly the successful methods used for studying the potential  @xcite .",
    "an iterative fuzzing is used , summing over spatial u - bends with three links : @xmath7 where a projection of a matrix @xmath8 to the su(3 ) matrix @xmath9 is carried out iteratively by maximising @xmath10 using a cabibbo - marinari approach . the best overlap with the ground state potential",
    "@xmath6 comes from large @xmath11 and large number of iterative steps  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present study , varying the parameters of the fuzzing prescription gave relatively little change .",
    "hence we select a smaller fuzzing level ( 5 ) and coarser fuzzing ( @xmath12 ) to minimise computer resources .",
    "the motivation of the method we are using is to join the quark and antiquark by a colour flux string .",
    "it is possible to arrange this scheme so that one can define modified _ propagators _ rather than modified _ operators_. this will have considerable computational advantages :",
    "once the appropriate fuzzed propagator is defined , the construction of hadronic correlations is as fast as for local propagators .",
    "we can define a fuzzed quark propagator to a site @xmath13 as the average of the propagators to the sites given by the six spatial displacements of distance @xmath14 from @xmath15 along the lattice axes together with the appropriate fuzzed links .",
    "the sum over all six orientations ( three forward and three backward spatial directions ) results in an isotropic spatial dependence ( in the spatial cubic group ) and so does not affect @xmath16 assignments .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fuzz](a ) , where the fuzzed links of length @xmath1 originating from the site @xmath13 along the six orientations are shown schematically . then if such a fuzzed propagator is contracted using an appropriate @xmath17 matrix with a purely local propagator to the site @xmath15 , a mesonic operator is constructed with the required properties .",
    "we refer to this combination as the lf operator .",
    "note that contracting two such fuzzed propagators ( i.e.  ff ) with the same value of @xmath1 is not likely to be useful since the fuzzed links will partly cancel to the identity , giving a component which is like a purely local hadronic operator ( i.e.  ll ) . for baryons ,",
    "three propagators need to be combined .",
    "we find that both llf and lff combinations are useful .",
    "they are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fuzz](b ) .    since we have access to light quark propagators from a single source ( * 0*,0 ) , we use the local operator at the source . at the sink at time @xmath0 ,",
    "we use the spatially - extended fuzzed operator of length @xmath1 described above . for notation",
    "we specify the source operator and then the sink operator used . for the mesons we thus form local - fuzzed ( ll , lf ) correlations by replacing one local propagator in the usual ( ll , ll ) formalism by the propagator fuzzed at the sink .    for baryons we consider two different non - local operator correlations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fuzz](b ) , these involve a di - quark separated from a quark ( single fuzzed - ( lll , llf ) ) and an arrangement of three quarks all separated ( double fuzzed  ( lll , lff ) ) .",
    "a triple fuzzed configuration could also be studied but , by the same reasoning as for the mesons , it has a component which is unfuzzed and so gives poor results .",
    "we also explored nucleon operators made of two fuzzed links at fixed angles ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "these operators are very computationally intensive to evaluate and gave no significant improvement in ground state extraction .    as remarked upon in sec .  1",
    ", the method for constructing effective operators described here has a direct physical interpretation only for heavy - quark mesons .",
    "however , it will be shown below that it can also be successfully used for hadrons consisting of light quarks .",
    "we use light - quark propagators in the @xmath20 configurations at @xmath21 obtained by ukqcd  @xcite using the clover improved fermion action . here",
    "we use values for the hopping parameter @xmath22 equal to 0.14144 and 0.14262 , which are the smallest / largest values respectively considered in  @xcite . for the detailed investigation we use @xmath23 ( which corresponds to the largest quark mass ) , while @xmath24 is primarily used to investigate the quark mass dependence of the results for the wave function . for both @xmath22 values",
    "the most comprehensive wave function results come from an analysis of 12 configurations .",
    "we are able to supplement these detailed wave function measurements with correlation data at fixed separation from a larger sample of 60 configurations  @xcite .",
    "this lattice study corresponds to lattice spacing @xmath25gev ( determined from the string tension ) , while the ratio @xmath26 0.77 and 0.52 for the two values of the hopping parameter respectively . also , at the smaller hopping parameter , @xmath27 gev , which is close to the value of the physical state ( @xmath28 meson ) built from strange quarks .    using the effective operators described in the previous section",
    ", we can now define the gauge - invariant correlation function ( ll , lf ) for mesons by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the product of fuzzed links of length @xmath1 originating from site @xmath31 in direction @xmath32 for a given time slice @xmath0 .",
    "the sum over spatial sites is needed to have momentum zero , while the sum over the six directions is for the correct @xmath16 . for baryons",
    "the expression is similar to the one above , with the @xmath33 component suitably replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 depends on the hadronic observable , e.g.  @xmath36 for the @xmath2 and @xmath37 for the @xmath3 .",
    "the explicit definitions of the hadronic interpolating fields used here can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the vector meson ( @xmath38 is obtained by averaging over the three polarisation states , while for the nucleon we average the @xmath39 and @xmath40 spinor indices of the correlator in the forwards time direction ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 ) and the @xmath43 and @xmath44 indices in the backwards time direction ( @xmath45 . for the @xmath46 one has additionally to project out the spin 3/2 component .",
    "let us focus on accurate determinations of the ground state mass .",
    "the data are usually presented by computing an effective mass .",
    "the ground state contribution dominates @xmath47 at large @xmath0 since @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . in practice , extracting the ground state mass @xmath50 from data with statistical errors which increase with @xmath0 is subtle .",
    "a good procedure is :    \\(i ) a multi - exponential fit to the widest acceptable @xmath0-range with    \\(ii ) several hadronic operators ( e.g.  @xmath1-values ) to stabilise the fit .",
    "one way to understand this guide is that the ground state is only determined accurately when an estimate of the first excited state is available .",
    "this is necessary since the energy difference controls the rate of approach of @xmath51 to the expression given by the ground state component alone .",
    "however , fitting two ( or more ) exponentials to just one function @xmath52 is not very stable : it is better to have several such functions ( provided that they do indeed have different relative amounts of ground state and excited state ) .",
    "thus we consider fits to a two - exponential function @xmath53 where periodicity in the time direction is understood in the case of mesons where appropriate .",
    "we use a simultaneous fit to data at all @xmath1 values and @xmath0 values by making use of correlated @xmath54 fits . when dealing with a limited number of data samples , conventional correlated fits are known to give biased results  @xcite .",
    "this is because the method for determining correlated @xmath54 is unreliable if the number of data samples is insufficient ( compared to the number of fit parameters ) .",
    "various methods have been suggested to deal with this .",
    "here we use the method proposed in  @xcite , which models the correlation matrix by treating its inverse as 5-diagonal .",
    "the 2-exponential fits are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : pimass][fig : nuclmass ] .    in the following , we use @xmath55 and 12 , which provide a broad enough spatial range for the hadrons considered here , as will be shown below .",
    "the purely local operators ( i.e.  those containing only ll and lll propagators ) then correspond to @xmath56 .",
    "statistical errors are determined by means of a bootstrap analysis .",
    "since we have only a small data set at our disposal , the bootstrap samples tend to have even stronger correlations among the data .",
    "this can give anomalous error estimates .",
    "we have , therefore , checked the statistical errors using a jackknife method .",
    "even though this procedure is limited by the small data size ( the largest number of single - elimination jackknife blocks being equal to the number of configurations , namely 12 ) , we found the errors to be of similar magnitude to those obtained from the bootstrap analysis .",
    "the effective mass @xmath57 at @xmath23 for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pimass ] and [ fig : rhomass ] , and for the nucleon in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclmass ] . for the baryon , where there are nine observables , the results for the effective mass are shown spread out on the vertical axis to aid legibility .",
    "the lines included in the figures are the results of the two - exponential fit eq.([fitf ] ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath46 are very similar to those illustrated for the nucleon .    for both the mesons and baryons",
    "the results clearly show that , by using fuzzed non - local operators , the plateau in the effective mass as a function of the time extent @xmath0 sets in at smaller values of @xmath0 than is the case for the purely local observables .",
    "furthermore , the plateau at the largest @xmath1 values tends to be approached from below as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the fuzzed data have larger errors at lower @xmath0 ( compared to the unfuzzed ones ) , but for larger @xmath0 the errors are comparable . the local ( unfuzzed )",
    "measurement thus appears to have an accurate but irrelevant component .",
    "although we have emphasized the advantages of making a simultaneous fit to several hadronic correlations , it is worth while to make a direct comparison of fits to either local operator data alone or to fuzzed operator data alone .",
    "this will enable a comparison to be made of the effectiveness of each method for extracting the ground state mass .",
    "thus we make single exponential fits in each case  looking for a plateau in @xmath58 . in table  1",
    "we list the results for the @xmath3 meson of such fits to the purely local ( ll , ll ) and to the fuzzed ( ll , lf ) correlation function with @xmath59 . at a given value of @xmath60",
    "the errors for the ground state mass are smaller for the local operator . however , if one chooses @xmath60 as small as possible consistent with the @xmath54 per degree of freedom being acceptable ( i.e.  @xmath61 ) , the errors on @xmath50 obtained from the fuzzed operators are smaller .",
    "furthermore , the local operator fit shows that the value of @xmath50 increases rapidly as @xmath60 is reduced below 11 .",
    "this implies that the results are very sensitive to an accurate estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "the fuzzed operator fit remains stable to such a reduction of @xmath60 .",
    "since , with highly correlated data , the estimate of goodness of fit can be unreliable , the sensitivity of the local operator fit to @xmath60 is an additional systematic error in that case .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to study the hadronic ( bethe - salpeter ) wave function determined from the non - local gauge - invariant operators discussed in the previous section . since we are limited by small statistics for the fuzzed operator measurements , we choose to supplement our analysis by using all available data to fix the energy difference between the ground state and first excited state masses . in particular , we make use of the full ukqcd data set of 60 configurations  @xcite for the local operators ( ll , ll ) as well as recent smeared results  @xcite . these consist of hadronic correlations with quark propagators smeared at the source and sink ( ss , ss ) and at the source only ( ss , ll ) by applying the jacobi smearing method at @xmath23 . for the @xmath2 we have data with @xmath62 as well as @xmath63 at each end , so that we effectively have twelve observables .",
    "a big advantage of having smeared and local operators for the same hadronic interpolating field is that it allows a factorising fit  @xcite .",
    "these in turn provide tight constraints on the ground and excited state masses .",
    "we make 2-exponential fits to the widest @xmath0-range that gives an acceptable @xmath54 .",
    "correlations among data at different @xmath0-values are taken into account in the fit using several stable models  @xcite .",
    "these mass differences between the first excited state and the ground state are then used in our wave function extraction fit . for each hadronic channel",
    ", we then fit simultaneously all the local and non - local hadron measurements calculated from the subset of 12 configurations to the fit function eq .",
    "( [ fitf ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 are then the required wave function .",
    "the values obtained from the fit are normalised so that @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "the wave function for the ground and first excited states obtained from the local operators and those involving only the fuzzed link of length @xmath1 , normalised as outlined above , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfpirho ] for the mesons and in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfbaryons ] for the baryons at @xmath23 .",
    "the behaviour of the ground state wave function for mesons in quenched qcd has recently been discussed in detail ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with those obtained in the literature using similar gauge - invariant definitions of the wave function  @xcite .    as far as we are aware , the excited state wave function has not been studied either for mesons or baryons .",
    "the interesting feature that can clearly be seen for all the hadronic observables considered here is the presence of a node in the excited state wave function as a function of the length of fuzzed links connecting the quark and antiquark at the sink . at this @xmath1-value ,",
    "the ratio of ground state wave function to excited state wave function becomes zero .",
    "this particular spatial extent ( @xmath68 ) , which is more or less the same for all the observables , thus seems to be an optimal choice for determining e.g.  the ground state mass , since the contamination of the ground state by higher excited states has been minimised . at larger @xmath1-values ,",
    "the effective mass plateau is seen to be reached from below as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is explained by the change in sign of the excited state wave function .",
    "to investigate what happens if the quark mass decreases , we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfbaryons](a ) the results for the nucleon wave function at @xmath24 .",
    "although we only consider @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the results are in agreement with those at the smaller @xmath22 value at the same distance .",
    "this is consistent with earlier conclusions regarding the independence of the ground state wave function on the value of the quark mass  @xcite .",
    "although the interpretation of the wave function as an indication of the physical size of the ( heavy ) hadron loses its meaning if the quark mass is decreased and our physical motivation is no longer strictly applicable , the operators described above are still effective in producing a clean ground state .",
    "this gives us confidence that these operators can be used regardless of the value of the hopping parameter ( quark mass ) .",
    "for the nucleon and @xmath46 , where we have two different non - local operators at our disposal , the ground state wave function for the llf operator is broader than that for the lff one .",
    "this can be understood since , for a given @xmath1 value , the quarks are on average farther apart in the lff case than the llf case , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fuzz](b ) . thus , if in the lff case we replace @xmath71 , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : wfnuclgs ] that the results for the llf and lff operators lie on a single curve .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with what one would naively expect : the colour charges at the end points of the lff baryon operator at the sink are effectively @xmath72 apart and so should be compared with the llf wave function at @xmath72 .",
    "further investigation of the angular dependence of the baryon wave function is possible using operators with two fuzzed links at fixed angles to each other . because these operators are not obtainable from our fuzzed propagator construction , they involve two orders of magnitude more computation than the lff operator which is a sum over a specific combination of them .",
    "the relative sizes of the hadronic wave function , normalised to one at zero distance , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : wfmesbar](a ) and [ fig : wfmesbar](b ) as functions of the physical distance for the ground states and excited states respectively . for the baryons we use the llf operators . to obtain the distance scale in physical units we use the value of the inverse lattice spacing determined by ukqcd from the static potential [ @xmath73 gev ] .",
    "the behaviour for the ground state wave function is as expected , with the @xmath3 meson and @xmath46 the largest , while the @xmath2 meson and nucleon show similar sizes  @xcite .",
    "the results for the excited state wave function for the different hadrons seem to be in agreement , even though the error bars are too large to make a definite claim . in each case",
    "the results are consistent with a node at @xmath74 gev@xmath75 .    in our investigation above",
    "we have used a fixed fuzzing level and corresponding value of @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) ) .",
    "we have , however , checked that the effective mass remains essentially unchanged if a higher fuzzing level is used .",
    "it is known from earlier studies of the wave function that fuzzing of the gauge links is vital to obtain a good overlap with the hadronic state one is studying .",
    "it was found in  @xcite , where a slightly different fuzzing algorithm was used , that the result for the wave function as a function of the fuzzing level converges rapidly as the level approaches 6 ( in their method ) .",
    "this would roughly correspond to the level used here .",
    "hence we do not expect the results presented above to change in any significant way if the fuzzing level were to be increased .",
    "the computational overhead needed to construct the fuzzed propagator at the sink from a local propagator is quite small . with fuzzing level @xmath76 ( we used @xmath77 ) ,",
    "then approximately @xmath78 matrix multiplications are needed per site ( @xmath79 complex matrix multiplications ) to create the fuzzed propagators . for the jacobi smearing method with @xmath80 iterations ( where @xmath81 is typical ) , approximately @xmath82 matrix multiplications per site are needed .",
    "thus the computational overhead is considerably smaller in the fuzzed prescription .",
    "in essence this comes from treating the sink / source as a sum of just 6 points for the fuzzing method . at the source",
    ", there is essentially an equal computational overhead in either case since smearing / fuzzing is only needed around one site .",
    "one drawback of the fuzzed propagator approach is that ff hadronic operators are not useful so one needs to combine local propagators to construct ll and lf combinations . for the jacobi smearing , on the other hand , ss operators are useful",
    ". in general , however , it helps to have at least two operator constructs in use so that multi - exponential fits can be stabilised .",
    "this implies that jacobi smearing should also make use of sl operators if possible .",
    "thus each method is improved if both local and smeared / fuzzed propagators are available .",
    "we have shown how to define a fuzzed quark propagator in an efficient way . combined with the usual local propagator , this then enables hadronic propagation to be studied with a wave function motivated by the heavy quark picture .",
    "this hadronic operator of length @xmath1 can be tuned to have no contribution from the first excited state by varying @xmath1 .",
    "this gives a plateau in the effective mass which extends to lower @xmath0-values .",
    "equivalently , the measured greens function will be dominated by the ground state at smaller @xmath0  and so will make calculations of ground state matrix elements more reliable .",
    "our prescription for creating extended hadronic operators seems to work equally well for all hadrons with the same fuzzed quark propagators as ingredients .",
    "this makes it computationally efficient .",
    "we have supported the view that 2-exponential fits to the @xmath0-dependence of hadronic correlations are needed to extract reliable ground state masses .",
    "such fits need several hadronic operators to make them stable . choosing fuzzed operators with different separations @xmath1 is an attractive and efficient way to do this",
