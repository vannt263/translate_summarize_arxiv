    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) posits that gravitational instability of the disc leads to formation of self - gravitating gas fragments that later contract into present day planets .",
    "this view has been strongly challenged in the last decade since it was shown that protoplanetary discs do not cool rapidly enough to fragment onto gas clumps inside several tens to a hundred au @xcite .",
    "this would preclude the model from explaining most of the giant planets , since most are detected at separations much smaller than this , all the way down to @xmath4  au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite argued that giant planets could be born far out but then migrate inward arbitrarily close to the parent star due to gravitational torques of the disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "crucially , gi planets are born as fluffy ( gas density @xmath5  g/@xmath6 ) and cold ( t@xmath7  k ) molecular gas fragments . in order to become dense jupiter - like giant planets , they must first contract to @xmath8  k at which point a rapid dynamical collapse occurs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "tantalisingly , if the planets migrate inward more rapidly than they contract , then they may be tidally disrupted .",
    "the disruption leaves behind a rocky / icy core if grains inside the planet managed to grow and sediment down into a core rapidly enough @xcite .",
    "this scheme , named `` tidal downsizing '' by @xcite , may _ potentially _ explain any mass planets at arbitrary separation from the host star within a single framework @xcite .",
    "here we focus on giant gas planets within the gi / td framework specifically .",
    "while the rapid ( migration time @xmath9 years , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) inward migration and tidal disruption process of gas fragments is crucial to td as a way of accounting for terrestrial - like planets , this processes challenges the formation of the gas giants themselves @xcite .",
    "firstly , since radiative contraction time of even the solar metallicity clouds is quite long ( @xmath10 years , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disruption process appears to be too efficient ( see  [ sec : under ] ) , so it is hard to explain how _ any _ close - in giant planets survive .",
    "secondly , radiative contraction of planets is slowed down at higher grain opacities @xcite .",
    "thus , tidal disruption in metal - rich environments should be even more efficient .",
    "this would seem to contradict the well known fact that giant planets are more abundant at higher metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is true then close - in giant planets must form via core accretion rather than gi ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    there may appear to exist a simple solution to the conundrum of too long a radiative cooling time for gi clumps : a strongly decreased grain opacity due to grain growth .",
    "@xcite find that in models that include grain growth , opacity decrease cuts the planet contraction time scale to as short as @xmath11 years .",
    "we do not favour this solution for two reasons .",
    "firstly , this would predict that protoplanetary discs of low metallicity stars would be ideal sites for gas giant planet formation .",
    "instead , @xcite shows that low metallicity stars are the least likely to host a giant planet .",
    "secondly , models of @xcite do not include collisional fragmentation of dust grain aggregates which are found to occur at relatively modest velocities in laboratory experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite consider grain growth and opacity in protoplanetary discs of t tauri stars .",
    "they find that models that neglect grain growth deplete the small grain population by a factor of a million in a few thousand years ( see their figure 3 ) , reducing the dust opacity significantly .",
    "however , the spectra of t tauri sources clearly require a copious presence of small dust grains even at ages of a few million years . to explain this ,",
    "@xcite argue that high speed dust aggregate fragmenting collision must be also taken into account .",
    "this then results in a quasi steady - state for dust distribution in which the smallest grain abundance is suppressed only mildly even after about a million years of grain growth ( see their fig .",
    "for these two ( observationally backed up ) reasons , we discount the possibility that grain opacity in gi fragments is much lower than the interstellar one , although we do explore some grain opacity reduction below .    the solution to the too - slow - cooling conundrum that is proposed here is based on another unexpected effect that grains have on gi clumps .",
    "@xcite investigated the structure of the gas `` atmosphere '' around the massive solid core built within the td gas fragments by grain settling .",
    "similar to ca theory , it was found that there exists a critical core mass , @xmath12 , beyond which the atmosphere may become self - gravitating and too massive to be in hydrostatic balance @xcite . following ca arguments",
    ", the authors argued that the atmosphere collapse sets off a phase of a rapid gas accretion onto the dense core .",
    "this may initiate a hydrodynamical collapse ( termed core - assisted gas capture instability ; cags hereafter ) of the whole gas fragment _ before _ a core - less fragment of same configuration would have collapsed , thus providing a second and an unexplored way for the formation of giant planets in the td picture .",
    "the original goal of this project was to follow up the work of @xcite with a hydrodynamical rather than hydrostatic code , and to model the whole gas clump rather than only its centre .",
    "in addition , we included external large grain deposition onto the planet , the so - called `` pebble accretion '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) of grains on massive bodies embedded in protoplanetary discs .",
    "in doing so we discovered that planets accreting grains can collapse more rapidly than those of fixed metallicity .",
    "it turned out that this effect has nothing to do with formation of the core directly , and instead originates in the fact that grain accretion on a planet in itself is a form of cooling .",
    "pending detailed analysis below , this last statement can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "consider the total energy of the pre - collapse planet of mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "it evolves in time according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radiative luminosity of the planet , and the last term on the right is the change in the gravitational potential energy of the planet , @xmath18 , due to grain accretion on it at the rate @xmath19 . in the constant metallicity case ( no pebble accretion )",
    "that was so far studied in literature @xcite , the second term on the right is absent , so that radiation is the only way for the planet to loose excess energy and contract towards h@xmath20 collapse .",
    "increasing metallicity of the planet increases dust opacity and decreases @xmath17 , hence slowing down its contraction .",
    "however , if @xmath21 , then the planet `` cools '' due to addition of metals , since @xmath22 becomes more negative . deposition of pebbles into a planet from outside may hence speed up rather than delay giant planet formation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the contraction of pre - collapse giant planets due to grain accretion in detail .",
    "to not over - complicate this first study by having to also study gagc , we turn off grain growth in the planet , with the result that grain sedimentation is negligible , and no core forms in the planet s centre .",
    "the more general case is to be studied in a near future paper .",
    "we use a 1d spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics code as well as analytic arguments to understand the planet s response to pebble deposition .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , the cooling challenge of gi - born fragments is described , and the rate of pebble accretion from the surrounding protoplanetary disc is estimated . in  [ sec : methods ] and in appendix [ appendix1 ] , numerical methods employed here are presented . ",
    "[ sec : intro_runs ] compares the evolution of planets enriched by metals either at birth or by pebble accretion , and  [",
    "sec : theory ] outlines an analytical toy model that helps to understand why metal accretion accelerates planet contraction .",
    "the analytical model is compared with grain - dominated contraction of numerically integrated polytropic clouds with fixed specific heats ratios ( @xmath23 ) , as well as a more realistic molecular planet in ",
    "[ sec : real ] .",
    "the conditions under which pebble accretion dominates planet contraction are delineated in ",
    "[ sec : grain_dom ] .",
    "a discussion is given in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the properties of the first gas condensations in a self - gravitating disc should be similar @xcite to that of the `` first cores '' @xcite in star formation , see also @xcite .",
    "the central temperature of these may be as low as @xmath24  k , hydrogen is molecular , and the mass of the fragment is of the order of a jupiter mass to perhaps @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "if the fragments cool sufficiently rapidly , reaching the central temperature of @xmath26  k _ before _ they are tidally disrupted , then dissociation of molecular hydrogen occurs . since post - collapse fragments are @xmath27 orders of magnitude denser than pre - collapse ones , post - collapse fragments are much more likely to survive as giant planets .",
    "h@xmath20 collapse is hence a necessary step to formation of a gas giant planet .",
    "however , radiative cooling times of isolated jupiter - mass pre - collapse fragments are @xmath28 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , far longer than the disc migration times , @xmath9 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : tcool ] shows the radiative cooling time of the pre - collapse planets , defined as @xmath29 where @xmath22 is the total energy of the fragment , and @xmath30 is the luminosity of the planet .",
    "the factor @xmath31 in the denominator is introduced empirically to better match the numerical calculations of planet contraction ( all the way to h@xmath20 dissociation ) reported below .    in accord with previous results @xcite , figure",
    "[ fig : tcool ] shows that more massive planets cool more rapidly . also note that , for all planetary masses , the initial cooling phase at @xmath32 of a few hundred k is much more rapid when the one at @xmath33  k. this is because the modulus of the total energy of the planet , @xmath34 , increases , whereas the luminosity @xmath35 usually drops with increasing @xmath32 since the planet contracts and opacity in the atmosphere rises .",
    "this implies that the cooling `` bottle neck '' for planets of any mass is always at @xmath36  k , that is , the planets are expected to spend more time contracting from @xmath37  k to h@xmath20 dissociation ( @xmath38  k or so , for most of our runs below ) than they spend contracting from their initial state towards @xmath39  k.    based on figure [ fig : tcool ] , the expected outcome of gi fragment contraction , while it also migrates inward rapidly , is that the fragment is tidally disrupted before it collapses @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 , it takes more than @xmath41 years for this collapse to take place .",
    "furthermore , calculations by @xcite show that irradiation from the parent star and the surrounding disc slows the contraction of the fragments further , and may in fact even reverse the heat flow from the planet . in this case the planet puffs up rather than contracts with time . in the presence of tidal shear from the parent star ,",
    "this is clearly a receipt for destruction rather than formation of a giant planet - to - be .",
    "giant planets are observed to be over - abundant in metals by a factor of a few to ten in the solar system and beyond @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that contraction of pre - collapse giant planets is slowed down further at high metallicites if dust opacity is proportional to the metallicity of the gas .    in the context of gi / td models ,",
    "we see two principal modes of metal enrichment of pre - collapse fragments .",
    "firstly , fragments can be enriched by solids at birth by efficient aerodynamic capturing of grains into spiral arms of the gravitationally unstable disc before it collapses onto fragments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model , therefore , pre - collapse planets are born more metal rich than the surrounding disc . for simplicity",
    ", we then assume that the metallicity of such planets remain constant with time .",
    "secondly , metals can be gained by accretion from the disc , as we explain now .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that `` pebbles '' , that is small solid bodies of @xmath42  cm - size can accrete efficiently on planetesimals and rocky protoplanets embedded in a disc .",
    "this can potentially speed up assembly of massive solid cores at tens of au distances from the host star , where core accretion via planetesimal capture is inefficient , and solve the problem of too long core assembly time scale of ca theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for planets such as neptune and uranus .    in this picture , the accretor follows a keplerian circular orbit of radius @xmath43 around the star of mass @xmath44 , whereas the gas in the disc moves at a velocity slightly smaller than the local keplerian , and there is also the local keplerian shear , so that there is always gas streaming past the accretor",
    ". the gas itself does not accrete onto the accretor since the gravity of the latter is insufficient to overcome the pressure gradient force of the gas .",
    "the small grains , on the other hand , are not supported against accretion onto the protoplanet by a pressure gradient .",
    "a similar situation may hold around a much more massive molecular gas fragment .",
    "@xcite show that radiative pre - heating of the surrounding disc material by the radiation from a young embedded protoplanet is important in deterring gas accretion onto relatively low mass proto - planets , @xmath45 .",
    "such planets are found to build a hydrostatic - like atmosphere around themselves .",
    "the gas pressure gradient around them is large enough to prevent accretion of gas from the disc",
    ". fragments with initial masses @xmath45 are found to migrate inward rapidly at more or less constant fragment mass until they are tidally challenged and eventually destroyed at @xmath46  au .",
    "more massive protoplanets instead accrete gas rapidly , becoming proto brown dwarfs and stalling at about their initial locations ( @xmath47  au ) .",
    "these results imply that , as far as planet formation is concerned , we need to limit our attention to relatively low mass gas fragments of a few jupiter masses as more massive fragments may form low mass stars , and eventually turn the system into a stellar binary , a situation that is well outside the scope of this paper .",
    "@xcite recently presented analytical estimates and numerical simulations of pebble accretion on large planetesimals and solid cores .",
    "we rescale their results to the case of a pre - collapse giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disc . due to the substantial mass of the planet (",
    "compared to planetesimals or solid cores ) , the accretion of pebbles on it is always in the `` hill s regime '' , when pebbles are accreted from the whole of the hill s radius , @xmath48 , where @xmath43 is the planet - star separation , and @xmath44 is the mass of the host star .",
    "the maximum rate , @xmath49 , at which the grain particles can be accreted by the planet in the this regime is ( see eq . 38 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pebbles surface density in the protoplanetary disc , hill s velocity is @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the keplerian angular speed at the location of the planet . in reality only grains intermediately strongly coupled to the gas , such that dimensionless stopping time , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are accreted as efficiently as equation [ mdot_hill ] suggests .",
    "the physical size of the particles in the strongly coupled regime , that is `` pebbles '' in our definition , depends on the protostellar disc properties and the radial distance from the star , @xmath56 . for the minimum mass solar nebula disc , @xcite",
    "show that particles of size @xmath57 are in the pebble regime , where @xmath58  au ) .",
    "thus , at the outer disc regions , @xmath59  au , pebble regime grains are actually about 1 mm or so .",
    "let us define the planet metallicity doubling time scale @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the initial mass of metals in the planet .",
    "let the fraction of mass in the pebble regime , that is , in the maximum efficiency accretion regime ( compared to the total mass in grains in the disc at radius @xmath43 ) be @xmath63 .",
    "further , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the total ( dust plus gas ) surface density of the disc , @xmath66 is the disc mass at radius @xmath43 , and we assumed that the disc metallicity is equal to the initial metallicity of the planet , @xmath67 .",
    "the end result is , @xmath68 now , in the early massive protoplanetary disc stage that is of interest here , the disc can be as massive as @xmath69 or more . picking this value for @xmath66 and @xmath70",
    ", we then have @xmath71 this shows that if the population of large grains is significant , e.g. , @xmath72 , then the time scale to double the initial metal content of the gas fragment is comparable or shorter than the typical migration time , @xmath73  years @xcite .",
    "tidal downsizing planets may then be non - trivially over - abundant in metals by the time they migrate into the inner few au of the protoplanetary disc region .",
    "clearly , @xmath49 and @xmath60 are functions of the disc properties , of the planet s location within the disc .",
    "further , the disc itself may be influenced by the interaction with the planet .",
    "for now we explore the case of a fixed @xmath60 , in which the planet is loaded by pebbles ( metals ) from outside at a constant rate as given by equation [ tz0 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is varied in a broad range to study the parameter space .",
    "the code used here is a spherically symmetric lagrangian hydrodynamics code first described in @xcite , expanded and updated since then as detailed in @xcite . here",
    "we actually simplify the dust - gas interactions module of the code to expose the metal - loading effect most clearly .",
    "the simplified set of equations permits a comparison with analytical solutions , which serves as a check of both the code and our physical intuition . in the papers cited just above",
    ", the focus was on formation of dense metal cores inside the fragment , and hence the relative dynamics of gas and pebbles within the fragment was important and modelled by two - fluid equations with aerodynamical gas force coupling the two species . in this paper , we turn off grain growth and vaporisation physics , assuming that grains are always `` small '' , setting @xmath74 m . in practice",
    "this means that there is no relative motion of gas and grains and hence our equations reduce to the standard one - fluid gas - dynamical equations .",
    "physically , this limit corresponds to the case when grains deposited into the outer reaches of the planet either do not grow sufficiently rapidly or get vaporised quickly if the fragment is too hot ( e.g. , water ice is vaporised already at @xmath75  k ) .",
    "the grains can however be mixed in with the gas throughout the cloud quickly by convection and turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the metallicity of the planet ( related to the grain to gas mass ratio ) is set to be uniform inside the planet at all times .",
    "the more complicated situation , where a relative gas - grain motion does occur , is of course of a significant interest as well , but , due to a considerably expanded parameter space in that case ( e.g. , has the core formed or not , and what is the chemical composition of that core ? )",
    "it is to be presented in the near future elsewhere .",
    "we emphasise that the `` metal loading '' effect presented here exists when the grains are allowed to sediment as well ; it is however not possible to study that analytically since grains are redistributed within the planet in a complicated way .",
    "following @xcite , we make a reasonable assumption that dust opacity in the fragment is directly proportional to the metallicity of the gas , @xmath76 .",
    "the opacity @xmath77 is then given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the interstellar gas plus dust opacities from @xcite which assume solar metallicity , @xmath80 , and @xmath81  const  @xmath82 is a positive constant , set to 0.1 everywhere in this paper , to account for possible opacity reduction due to grain growth .",
    "the main conclusions of our paper are unchanged irrespectively of the value of @xmath83 , except that the parameter space where metal loading dominates as a cooling process of course does depend on @xmath84 , as described below in  7 .    the full set of equations being solved for numerical experiments in this paper is presented in the appendix .",
    "the initial conditions are polytropic spheres of a given central temperature @xmath32 , metallicity ( usually solar metallicity ) , and total mass @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : exp1 ] shows contraction calculations for a planet of @xmath85 masses , with grain opacity reduced by a factor of @xmath86 , performed under two different assumptions about the planet s grain content .",
    "the left hand panels show the cases of constant planet metallicity ( enrichment at birth model ) , where @xmath87 and 2 times the solar metallicity .",
    "the right hand panels show the same calculation but for the planets all starting with the solar grain abundance at @xmath88 and then metal - loaded by pebble deposition at five different ( constant ) rates as labelled on the figure .",
    "in particular , the curves are computed for metal loading times ranging from @xmath89  years to @xmath90  years , in steps of a factor of 2 .",
    "note that the shortest @xmath91 values are unlikely to be reached even in the inner disc regions ( unless radial drift of pebbles , see * ? ? ?",
    "* significantly increases the local pebble abundance ) .",
    "however , such cases expose the metal loading effects clearly . in a follow up paper ( nayakshin 2014 ,",
    "submitted ) , the pebble accretion rate is calculated self - consistently from the surrounding disc properties , which is modelled in some detail similarly to @xcite .",
    "the constant metallicity cases , panels ( a ) and ( b ) , are in a qualitative agreement with results of @xcite .",
    "the time taken by the planet to contract to the point of collapse increases with increasing @xmath76 , somewhat less rapidly than a linear proportion .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show a completely different evolution , however .",
    "the more rapidly the metals are added to the planet , the more rapidly it contracts and eventually collapses via h@xmath20 dissociation . in the most rapid metal - loading case , @xmath89  years",
    ", the collapse time scale is shortened by a factor of almost four compared with the solar metallicity case . for this particular case , the metallicity at collapse is @xmath92 , eight times larger than the starting value , @xmath93 .",
    "based on the left hand side panels , one would expect that collapse time scale for such a high metallicity fragment would be a factor of @xmath3 longer than the solar metallicity case , not shorter .",
    "there is thus over an order of magnitude difference in the collapse time scale for this particular case between the enrichment at birth and a gradual metal deposition models .",
    "figure [ fig : exp2 ] shows another numerical experiment that helps to shed more light on the situation .",
    "the planets here are started exactly as the ones presented in figures 2c and 2d , with the same choices for the metal doubling time , but grain accretion is termined when the central temperature reaches @xmath94  k. the exact numerical value of the termination temperature is not important .",
    "figure [ fig : exp2 ] shows that once grain accretion stops , contraction of the cloud continues _ at a slower _ rate than that for a non - metal - polluted planet ,",
    "i.e. , one recovers the main result of the fixed metallicity cases shown in figure [ fig : exp1]a and [ fig : exp1]b .",
    "for example , for the case of the most rapid metal loading , @xmath89  years , the fragment collapsed at less than 2,000 years in figure [ fig : exp1](a ) , but collapses only at @xmath95  years when grain accretion is discontinued .",
    "these results indicate that pebble deposition into a pre - collapse planet produces two opposing effects , one delaying contraction of the planet , and the other speeding it up .",
    "the former effect is due to the increase in the dust opacity which slows down radiative contraction of the fragment . in our opacity model ,",
    "this effect depends on the instantaneous amount of dust in the planet , that is , its metallicity .",
    "the latter effect however depends not on the amount of dust in the planet but on the rate of grain deposition into the planet , as hinted in the introduction .",
    "to understand how grain accretion can accelerate collapse of a planet we turn to a simple analytical model in which the planet is modelled as a polytropic sphere of adiabatic index @xmath96 .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of the gas in the sphere is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 and the total ( gas plus metals ) pressure and density , respectively , and @xmath100 is a constant throughout all of the planet .",
    "constancy of @xmath100 is assumed to be maintained by convection that is known to be the main energy transfer mechanism within h@xmath20 dominated planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xmath23 varies from @xmath101 at @xmath102  k to @xmath103 in a relatively broad temperature range , @xmath104  k , and finally drops to @xmath105 at @xmath106  k ( see figure [ fig : h2_planets]a below , and * ? ? ?",

    "however , qualitatively , h@xmath20 dominated gas fragments behave as polytropes with @xmath23 varying from @xmath108 at low @xmath32 to @xmath109 at @xmath110  k.    the total energy of a polytrope of mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "since @xmath100 is related to entropy per unit mass of the planet , this provides another interpretation of the metal loading effect : adding metals decreases entropy of the cloud , just as radiative cooling does , so metal accretion is effectively a cooling mechanism .",

    "clearly , each pre - collapse planet configuration spans a range of densities and temperatures , from the maximum in the centre to the minimum in the atmosphere . to relate to the analytical theory derived in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we define effective @xmath23 and @xmath137 for a planet by computing the gravitational potential energy of that planet and then comparing it with that of a polytropic planet of the same mass and radius , e.g. , @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "the values of the @xmath171 versus planet s central temperature are plotted in figure [ fig : h2_planets]a for two planetary masses , @xmath70 and @xmath172 .",
    "these are very similar all the way to @xmath173  k. as can be expected , @xmath171 for a planet bears a strong resemblance to the @xmath174 function ( the solid curve ) , except smoothed out somewhat due to the presence of a range of temperatures inside a planet , and also shifted to higher temperatures since @xmath32 represents the maximum temperature in a given planet , whereas @xmath171 is probably related more closely to a mean temperature in the planet .",
    "now , the analytical theory developed in  [ sec : theory ] predicts how the central temperature of a polytropic planet varies with its metallicity when grains are added to the planet , e.g. , @xmath175 ( equation [ tc1 ] ) , where we defined `` metallicity exponent '' @xmath176 the dependence of @xmath177 on central temperature is plotted in figure [ fig : h2_planets]b for the two planetary masses , and also for the solid curve from figure [ fig : h2_planets]a ( corresponding to fixed gas density of @xmath178 g/@xmath6 ) .",
    "the dash - dotted curve passing through red triangles in the panel shows @xmath179 $ ] actually measured in simulations of planets of mass @xmath172 loaded with metals . these ( short ) runs are started with the planets initialised as polytropic spheres of solar metal abundance following the ideal eos with @xmath32 shown on the horizontal axis .",
    "the metals are added to the planets in the same way as described in ",
    "[ sec : intro_runs ] , with @xmath180  years ( the choice of @xmath91 is unimportant for this plot ) .",
    "we then measure @xmath181 when @xmath76 varies by a small increment . to make sure",
    "that radiative cooling of the planet , which also drives evolution of @xmath32 in realistic planets , does not corrupt our measurement of @xmath181 , we set the opacity multiplier to a very large number ( @xmath182 ) to turn off radiative cooling of the planet for figure [ fig : h2_planets ] .    the dash - dotted curve ( measured @xmath181 )",
    "should be compared with the dashed one ( predicted ) .",
    "these two are relatively close but do not coincide exactly , which probably reflects the fact that our definition of @xmath183 in equation [ egrav ] is somewhat arbitrary , and is only one possible way to define an effective @xmath23 for a planet . using the total energy of the planet to define @xmath23 , for example , gives slightly different values for @xmath171 .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement appears reasonable and hence the analytical theory has some utility in explaining contraction of metal - loaded pre - collapse planets .",
    "we also define the central temperature doubling metallicity , @xmath184 , as metallicity at which @xmath32 is twice its initial value , @xmath185 .",
    "given the definition of @xmath181 and equation [ tc1 ] , @xmath186 where @xmath67 is the initial planet s metallicity .",
    "the doubling metallicity in units of solar metallicity , and assuming @xmath187 , is plotted in figure [ fig : h2_planets]c for the same models as in the two panels above it .",
    "we can see that metal over - abundance of a factor of a few to ten in solar metallicity units is required to cause the planet to shrink by a factor of two in radius ( planet s radius is nearly exactly inversely proportional to @xmath188 ) .",
    "the required metal over - abundance is smaller at higher temperatures because the planet is closer to the unstable value of @xmath189 at higher @xmath32 .",
    "having studied the contraction rates of planets loaded by metals , we can now ask the question of when such a contraction is faster than that due to radiative cooling .",
    "this happens when the rate of central temperature increase due to radiative cooling rate is equal to the that due to metal loading .",
    "the latter can be found via @xmath190 now , using equation [ sigmaz ] and definition @xmath191 , where @xmath192 and @xmath193 and the total mass of gas and metals in the planet , we write @xmath194 the condition of the two contraction rates being equal to each other reads @xmath195 where we set @xmath162 .",
    "this defines the critical metal loading time scale , @xmath196 , such that if metals are supplied to the planet on a time scale shorter than @xmath196 then the planet contracts mainly due to the increasing metal content rather than radiative cooling . according to equation [ eq_rates ] , the critical time is @xmath197 figure [ fig : tz_crit ] plots the critical metal loading time versus planet s central temperature for the same range of planetary masses as in figure [ fig : tcool ] .",
    "the curves showing @xmath196 are qualitatively similar to those showing @xmath198 for obvious reasons save for the absolute values , and the factor @xmath181 that is a function of @xmath32 .",
    "this figure shows that loading the planet by metals at a typical @xmath60 of a few thousand years , as estimated in ",
    "[ sec : mdot_grain ] , is not likely to affect relatively massive planets , @xmath199 , at the beginning of their evolution , but may affect them when they contract towards @xmath200  k. this finding is consistent with the right panels of figure [ fig : exp1 ] , in which the central temperature evolution of metal - loaded planets fed by metals at different rates was shown .",
    "the figure showed that early evolution of planets , when @xmath201  k , is indistinguishable for different @xmath60 , at least in a rather broad range of @xmath60 , from 250 years all the way to @xmath202 .",
    "this can now be understood in terms of the radiation - dominated phase of the planet s contraction : early on the planet contracts radiatively more rapidly than it does due to metal loading , even at the shortest @xmath60 explored in the figure . at later times , however , depending on @xmath60 , the planets go off the fixed metallicity ( solid curve in figure [ fig : exp1]c ) track and accelerate onto the metal - dominated part of their evolution .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : tz_crit ] predicts that evolution of lower mass gas fragments may be much more sensitive to deposition of metals .",
    "for example , for @xmath203 , even @xmath204 years is short enough to dominate fragment s contraction .",
    "one preliminary conclusion from this , which clearly needs to be explored more rigorously in a realistic evolving protoplanetary disc setting , is that lower mass giant planets formed by gi / td may be more metal rich .",
    "physically , it takes far longer for these planets to contract ( because their radiative cooling times are much longer , see figure [ fig : tcool ] ) . for this reason",
    ", they are likely to have a lower central temperature for longer than their massive cousins . based on the theory developed above and",
    "figure [ fig : h2_planets ] , their contraction due to metal loading is therefore slower , and hence they may be able to absorb more metals before they collapse .",
    "while a full scale investigation of this prediction is outside the scope of our paper , figure [ fig : m1m4 ] compares the evolution of two planets , @xmath205 , which was already shown in figures [ fig : exp1]c , d with the long dash curves , while the other planet has a lower mass , @xmath206 .",
    "the solid lines in figures [ fig : m1m4]a , b show the evolution of the central temperature and metallicity , @xmath76 , respectively , for @xmath206 . the dashed curve in figure [ fig : m1m4]b show the ratio of the critical metal loading time scale to the actual value of @xmath60 ( @xmath207  years for both runs ) . except for the earliest times , that ratio is always greater than unity , suggesting that evolution of this planet is nearly always metal dominated .",
    "this planet collapses at @xmath208  myr almost entirely due to metal loading rather than radiation . by the time the planet collapses , its metallicity is very high , @xmath209 , e.g. , some 20 times higher than @xmath80 .",
    "the evolution of the more massive planet is distinctly different . since such planets are cooling much more rapidly ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , metal loading is a relatively minor effect in this case , with @xmath210 everywhere ( see figure [ fig : m1m4]d ) . the evolution of a massive planet is hence radiation - dominated .",
    "the critical loading time @xmath196 is calculated using equation [ tcrit1 ] , where the radiative time is found at each time step using the definition from equation [ trad ] , the metallicity exponent @xmath177 is computed using equation [ sigmaz ] and definition of @xmath137 given by equation [ egrav ] .",
    "in this paper we have shown that accretion of pebbles from the surrounding protoplanetary disc is a surprisingly efficient way for pre - collapse h@xmath20 dominated planets to contract and eventually collapse in high opacity regime .",
    "the simplest way to understand this result is to ( 1 ) realise that a gentle sedimentation of grains onto a planet brings in additional gravitational potential energy but not thermal or kinetic energy , so that the total energy of the cloud becomes more negative . ( 2 ) the reason for a surprising sensitivity of molecular pre - collapse planets to metals is the fact that the total energy of a polytropic cloud with index @xmath137 ( equation [ etot1 ] ) with @xmath127 is very small compared to @xmath211 ( e.g. , @xmath212 for @xmath138 ) , so it takes only a little extra weight in metals to topple the planet over into the unstable h@xmath20 dissociation regime .",
    "the implications of our results for td hypothesis and gi - born planets are potentially significant .",
    "first of all , metal loading makes it much more likely that these planets are able to contract and collapse despite a rapid inward migration .",
    "this may help to resolve the challenges to forming gi planets at short separations by migration of fragments born at separations @xmath7  au emphasised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "secondly , metal loading process may explain why giant planets are over - abundant in metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , td / gi planet survival may be enhanced at high metallicities since the rates of pebble accretion are higher , making the planets collapse sooner , while planet migration rates are unlikely to depend on disc metallicity strongly .",
    "this may produce a positive giant planet frequency ",
    "host star metallicity correlation as needed to explain observations @xcite .",
    "these issues will be addressed in a separate forthcoming publication where the disc - planet interaction is modelled in detail .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , low opacity in pre - collapse gi clumps may be another way to speed up the collapse @xcite , but it is not clear if opacity in the clumps is indeed much smaller than the interstellar one .",
    "@xcite argued that grain aggregate fragmentation in higher speed collisions is required by observations of t tauri stars to maintain a high abundance of small grains despite the simultaneous presence of grains as large as @xmath213  cm in size .",
    "furthermore , the low dust opacity picture would predict a very efficient formation of giant planets at low metallicities , which contradicts observations @xcite .",
    "we also found that the response of giant planets to metal loading is a strong function of their mass .",
    "more massive planets are less likely to be influenced by metal accretion since they cool much more rapidly than their lower mass cousins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m1m4 ] ) .",
    "this gives us hope that there may be strong trends in predictions of the td model with fragment s mass that could hopefully be used to contrast it with observations of exoplanets .",
    "the main shortcomings of our numerical approach here are ( i ) the simplification in the eos that neglects metals contribution to the internal energy and pressure of the mix ( see appendix ) , and ( ii ) assuming a homogenous spreading of the grains inside the planet .",
    "both of these are made in order to keep our treatment as transparent as possible and to enable a comparison to the analytical model developed in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "furthermore , preliminary results of simulations with a more complete eos show that this only strengthens the tendency of the fragments to collapse due to metal loading because grain vaporisation must occur before the fragment collapses ( as @xmath214  k at that point ) , and this process takes extra energy from the gas due to the latent heat of vaporisation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cooling the fragment yet more . the assumption that grains are well mixed with gas is reasonable if convection stirs the grains up quickly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mixing newly accreted grains throughout the planet efficiently .",
