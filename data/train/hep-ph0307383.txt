    "in exploring the microscopic structure of matter , there are two frequently - used approaches .",
    "first , the spatial distribution of matter ( or charge ) in a system can be probed through elastic scattering of electrons , or photons , or neutrons , etc . the physical quantity that one measures is the elastic form ( structure ) factors which depend on three - momentum transfer to the system .",
    "the fourier transformation of the form factors provides direct information on the spatial distributions .",
    "the well - known examples include the study of charge distribution in an atom and the atomic structure of a crystal .",
    "the second approach is designed to measure the population of the constituents as a function of momentum , or the momentum distribution , through knock - out scattering . here",
    "the well - known examples include the nucleon distributions in nuclei measured through quasi - elastic electron scattering , and the distribution of atoms in a quantum liquid probed through neutron scattering .",
    "the scattering cross section sometimes depends on the reaction dynamics which must be understood before the momentum distribution can be extracted .",
    "both approaches are complementary , but bear similar drawbacks .",
    "the form factor measurements do not yield any information about the underlying dynamics of the system such as the speed of the constituents , whereas the momentum distribution does not give any information on the spatial location of the constituents .",
    "more complete information about the microscopic structure lies in the correlation between the momentum and coordinate spaces , i.e. , to know where a particle is located and , at the same time , with what velocity it travels .",
    "this information is certainly attainable for a classical system for which one can define and study the phase - space distribution of the constituents . for a quantum mechanical particle",
    ", however , the notion of a phase - space distribution seems less useful because of the uncertainty principle .",
    "nonetheless , the first phase - space distribution in quantum mechanics was introduced by wigner in 1932 @xcite , and many similar distributions have been studied thereafter .",
    "these distributions have been used for various purposes in very diverse areas such heavy - ion collisions , quantum molecular dynamics , signal analysis , quantum information , optics , image processing , non - linear dynamics , etc.@xcite in certain cases , the wigner distributions can even be measured directly in experiments @xcite , providing much information about the dynamics of a system .",
    "the main interest of this paper is about the internal structure of the proton ( or neutron ) , for which the underlying fundamental theory is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . with some changes to accommodate the relativistic nature of the problem",
    ", both experimental approaches alluded to above have been successfully used to unravel its quark and gluon structure : the elastic form factors of the proton have been measured since the 1950s and , at low - momentum transfer ( @xmath0 nucleon mass @xmath1 ) where the nucleon recoil effects are small , the three - dimensional ( 3d ) fourier transformation of these form factors can be interpreted as spatial charge and current distributions of quarks @xcite .",
    "feynman parton distributions , measurable in high - energy inelastic scattering such as deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan process , have a simple interpretation as the momentum distributions of the quarks and gluons in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) @xcite .",
    "however , the notion of correlated position and momentum distributions of quarks and gluons has not been systematically investigated in the field , although it is clear that the physics of a phase - space distribution must be very rich .    in this paper , we explore to what extent one can construct physically - interesting and experimentally - measurable phase - space distributions in qcd , and what information it contains about the qcd parton dynamics .",
    "[ a brief account of some of the results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite . ] to facilitate the construction , we examine the uncertainty in the traditional interpretation of electromagnetic form factors due to relativity , and analyze the physical content of the feynman parton distributions in the rest frame of the proton .",
    "we then introduce the phase - space wigner distributions for the quarks and gluons in the proton , which contain most general one - body information of partons , corresponding to the full one - body density matrix in technical terms . after integrating over the spatial coordinates",
    ", one recovers the familiar transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some reduced version of the distributions is related , through a specific fourier transformation , to the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) which have been studied extensively in the literature in recent years @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "a gpd is a one - body matrix element which combines the kinematics of both elastic form factors and feynman parton distributions , and is measurable in hard exclusive processes .",
    "therefore , the notion of phase - space distribution provides a new 3d interpretation of the gpds in the rest frame of the proton .",
    "there are other interpretations of the gpd in the literature which are made in imf and impact parameter space @xcite .",
    "the presentation of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we examine the constraints on the physical interpretation of the form factors and parton distributions from relativistic effects , anticipating their extension to a full phase - space distribution . in section iii , we first briefly summarize the main features of a quantum mechanical wigner distribution , then introduce the quantum phase - space distributions for the quarks and gluons in a rest - frame proton . in section iv , we exhibit the spatial 3d images of quarks generated from slicing the quantum phase - space ( wigner ) distributions at different feynman momentum and comment on their general features .",
    "section v contains the summary and conclusion .",
    "in the literature , the quantum phase - space distributions have been mostly applied to non - relativistic systems . for the proton",
    ", however , relativity is essential . in measuring the elastic form factors of the proton",
    ", the momentum transfer to the system can easily exceed the rest mass , resulting a large recoil and lorentz contraction .",
    "the quarks and gluons inside the proton follow relativistic dynamics .",
    "moreover , when a quark is struck in a dis experiment , it travels along the light - cone : the trajectory of an extreme - relativistic particle .",
    "therefore , to develop a phase - space distribution of the proton , we must examine to what extent the notion actually makes sense for relativistic systems .    in the first subsection",
    ", we examine the textbook interpretation of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton , reminding the reader that there are intrinsic ambiguities in the interpretation .",
    "we emphasize , however , that different ways of the interpreting the form factors can be regarded as different choices of schemes .",
    "when used consistently , one scheme is in principle as good as any other .",
    "the degree of scheme dependence depends on @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass and @xmath4 is some kind of radius , which is @xmath51/4 for the proton .    in the second subsection",
    ", we consider the feynman parton distributions , most - commonly interpreted as the momentum densities in imf .",
    "since the notion of a phase - space distribution is meant for a proton in its _ rest frame _ , and since the distribution should be reduced to the feynman distribution after integrating out the spatial coordinates , we are compelled to examine the physics of latter in the static system of coordinates . in particular , we need to understand the meaning of feynman momentum @xmath6 in that context .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing the so - called _",
    "spectral function_the correlated momentum and energy distribution of the constituents  familiar in non - relativistic many - body physics . in the process",
    ", we find that the separation between particle and antiparticle , familiar in the imf , disappears : one can only keep track of the creation and annihilation of fermion quantum numbers , such as the electric charge .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors are among the first measured and mostly studied observables of the nucleon .",
    "they are defined as the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current between the nucleon states of different four - momenta . because the nucleon is a spin one - half particle , the matrix element defines two form factors , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the well - known dirac and pauli form factors , respectively , depending on the momentum transfer @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is nucleon spinor normalized as @xmath12 .",
    "since the beginning , it has been known that the physical interpretation of the nucleon form factors is complicated by relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "consider a system of size @xmath4 and mass @xmath3 .",
    "in relativistic quantum theory , the system can not be localized to a precision better than its compton wavelength @xmath13 .",
    "any attempt to do this with an external potential will result in creation of particle - antiparticle pairs . as a consequence , the static size of the system",
    "can not be defined to a precision better than @xmath13 . if @xmath14 , which is the case for all non - relativistic systems , the above is not a significant constraint .",
    "one can probe the internal structure of the system with a wavelength ( @xmath15 ) comparable to or even much smaller than @xmath4 , but still large enough compared to @xmath13 so that the probe does not induce an appreciable recoil .",
    "a familiar example is the hydrogen atom for which @xmath16 , and the form factor can be measured through electron scattering with momentum transfer @xmath17 .",
    "when the probing wavelength is comparable to @xmath13 , the form factors are no longer determined by the internal structure alone .",
    "they contain also the dynamical effects of lorentz boosts because the initial and final protons have different momenta .",
    "in relativistic quantum theory , the boost operators involve nontrivial dynamical effects which result in the nucleon wave function being different in different frame ( in the usual instant form of quantization ) .",
    "therefore in the region @xmath18 , the physical interpretation of the form factors is complicated because of the entanglement of the internal and the center - of - mass motions in relativistic dynamics . in the limit @xmath19",
    ", the former factors depend almost entirely on the physical mechanism producing the overall change of the proton momentum .",
    "the structural effect involved is a very small part of the nucleon wave function ( usually the minimal fock component only ) .    for the nucleon , @xmath20 .",
    "although much less certain than in the case of the hydrogen atom , it seems still sensible to have a rest - frame picture in terms of the electromagnetic form factors , so long as one keeps in mind that equally justified definitions of the nucleon sizes can differ by @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the traditional definition of the proton charge radius in terms of the slope of the sachs form factor @xmath22 is 0.86 fm . on the other hand , if one uses the slope of the dirac form factor @xmath8 to define the charge radius , one gets 0.79 fm , about 10% smaller .",
    "the form factors at @xmath23 gev can not be interpreted as information about the internal structure alone .    to further clarify the uncertainty involved in the interpretation of the electromagnetic form factors ,",
    "let us review the textbook explanation offered originally by sachs @xcite .    to establish the notion of a static ( charge ) distribution",
    ", one needs to create a wave - packet representing a proton localized at @xmath24 @xmath25 where the plane - wave state @xmath26 is normalized in a relativistic - covariant manner @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the momentum space profile normalized as @xmath29 .",
    "the wave - packet is not an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , as time progresses , the wave packet will spread .",
    "the characteristic spreading time is proportional to @xmath30 which is long for a non - relativistic system .",
    "but for a relativistic particle , the spread could happen much faster compared to the characteristic time - scale of a weakly - interacting probe .",
    "having localized the wave - packet at @xmath31 , we can calculate , for example , the charge distribution in the wave - packet @xmath32 where @xmath33 measures the relative distance to the center @xmath31 . taking its fourier transform ,",
    "one gets @xmath34 where we have changed the momentum integration variables , with @xmath35 representing the average momentum of the initial and final protons .",
    "it is important to point out that the resolution momentum @xmath36 is now linked to the difference in the initial and final state momenta . in non - relativistic quantum systems , because of the large masses , the momentum transfer causes little change in velocity , and hence the initial and final states have practically the same intrinsic wave functions . in relativistic systems",
    ", this is the origin of the difficulty in interpreting the form - factor : we do not have a matrix element involving the same intrinsic proton state .    to remove the effects of the wave packet ,",
    "the necessary condition on @xmath28 is that the coordinate - space size of the wave - packet must be much smaller than the system size @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the probing wave length , or resolution scale , must also be large compared with the size of the wave - packet @xmath38",
    ". then one can ignore @xmath36-dependence in @xmath39 , so that @xmath40 @xmath41 on the other hand , to be insensitive to the anti - particle degrees of freedom , the size of the wave packet must be larger than the proton compton wave length @xmath42 . in the momentum space",
    "this corresponds to restrictions on momenta allowed in the wave packet @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the combined constraint on the wave packet profile is @xmath44 which gives @xmath45 this is the matrix element of the charge density in the breit frame , and is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the sachs electric form factor ( @xmath48 ) and the weyl spinors involved are normalized conventionally by @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we arrive at the textbook interpretation of @xmath50 as a fourier transformation of the proton charge distribution .    likewise , the sachs magnetic form factor @xmath51 is obtained from the breit frame matrix element of the electric current @xmath52 g_m ( t ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the three - vector of spin is @xmath53 .",
    "it must be pointed out that the charge and magnetization distributions thus defined contains the lorentz contraction effects along the photon direction @xmath36 when @xmath54 , which make the proton look like a pancake .",
    "various prescriptions exist in the literature which have been proposed to remove the relativity effects and extract the  intrinsic \" charge / magnetization distributions from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to accomplish it in a model - independent way .    since relativity makes the interpretation of the electromagnetic form factors non - unique , the best one can do is to choose one particular interpretation and work consistently .",
    "for example , when extracting the proton charge radius from the lamb shift measurements , one shall use the same definition as from the electric form factor .",
    "the most frequently - used definition is that of sachs , but other schemes are equally good and the scheme dependence disappears in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "this is very much like the renormalization scheme dependence of parton densities due to radiative corrections at finite strong coupling constant @xmath56 : although the @xmath57 scheme is the most popular in the literature , one can use the parton densities in any other scheme to correlate physical observables . in this paper , we adopt the sachs interpretation of the form factors .",
    "relativistic corrections and lorentz contraction effects in the transverse dimensions are found to disappear in an imf @xcite . there",
    "the proton has an infinitely large effective mass , and hence for physics in the transverse dimensions , we are back to the non - relativistic case",
    ". in particular , one can localize the proton in the transverse coordinate space with no recoil corrections .",
    "the dirac form factor @xmath8 is found to be related to the charge distribution in transverse plane , with information along the @xmath58-axis integrated .",
    "the price one pays for eliminating the relativistic effects is the loss of a spatial dimension .",
    "parton distributions were introduced by feynman to describe deep - inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "they have the simplest interpretation in the imf as the densities of partons in the longitudinal momentum @xmath6 . in qcd , the quark distribution is defined through the following matrix element , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is a vector along the direction of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is a quark field with an associated gauge link extending from the position of the quark to infinity along the light cone , and hence is gauge - invariant in non - singular gauges .",
    "the renormalization scale dependence is implicit . in light - cone quantization @xcite",
    ", it is easy to get @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are creation operators of a quark and an anti - quark , respectively , with longitudinal momentum @xmath67 and transverse momentum @xmath68 .",
    "the interpretation as parton densities is then obvious .    to construct the quantum phase - space distributions for the quarks , we need an interpretation of the feynman densities in the rest frame",
    "this is because the imf involves a lorentz boost along the @xmath58-direction which destroys the rotational symmetry of the 3d space .",
    "however , if one works in the rest frame of the proton , the two quark fields in eq .",
    "( [ qcdpd ] ) are not at the same time .",
    "if one fourier - expands one of the fields in terms of quark creation and annihilation operators , the other must be determined from heisenberg equation of motion .",
    "the result is that the bi - linear quark operator takes a very complicated expression in terms of the creation and annihilation operators in the equal - time quantization .",
    "the physics of the feynman quark distribution in the rest frame is made more clear through the notion of the _ spectral function _",
    "@xmath69 which is the dispersive part of the single - quark green s function in the proton .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath70 can be seen from its spectral representation , @xmath71 is a fourier transformation of @xmath72 : it is the probability of annihilating a quark ( or creating an antiquark ) of _ four_-momentum @xmath73 ( three - momentum @xmath74 and the off - shell energy @xmath75 ) in the nucleon , leading to an  on - shell \" state of energy - momentum @xmath76 .",
    "the quark here is off - shell because if @xmath77 and @xmath78 are both  on - shell \" , @xmath79 in general . [ that the partons are off - shell are in fact also true in the imf calculations .",
    "] of course , in qcd @xmath80 is not in the hilbert space , but the spectral function itself is still a meaningful quantity .",
    "since the quarks are ultra - relativistic , @xmath81 contains both quark and antiquark fock operators .",
    "one can not in general separate quark and anti - quark contributions , unlike in the non - relativistic systems in which only the particle or antiparticle contribute .",
    "in fact , if one expands the above expression , one finds pair creations and annihilation terms .",
    "however , this is also true for the charge density discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "therefore we can speak of @xmath70 as a distribution of vector charges and currents , but not a particle density . in nuclear physics where the non - relativistic dynamics dominates ,",
    "the nucleon spectral function in the nucleus is positive definite and can be regarded as a particle density .",
    "the nuclear spectral function is directly measurable through pick - up and knock - out experiments , in which @xmath82 and @xmath74 are called the missing energy and missing momentum , respectively ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is now easy to see that in the rest frame of the proton , the feynman quark distribution is @xmath83 the @xmath6 variable is simply a special combination of the off - shell energy @xmath84 and momentum @xmath85 .",
    "the parton distribution is the spectral function of quarks projected along a special direction in the four - dimensional energy - momentum space .",
    "the quarks with different @xmath84 and @xmath85 can have the same @xmath6 , and moreover , the both @xmath86 and @xmath87 distributions contain contributions from quarks and anti - quarks .    to summarize , in the proton rest frame , the quarks are naturally off - shell , and hence have a distribution in the four - dimensional energy - momentum space .",
    "the feynman distribution comes from a reduction of the full distribution along a special direction .",
    "in classical physics , a state of a particle is specified by its position @xmath33 and momentum @xmath35 . in a gas of classical particles ,",
    "the single - particle properties are described by a phase - space distribution @xmath88 representing the density of particles at a phase - space point @xmath89 .",
    "time evolution of the distribution is governed by the boltzmann equation , or liouville equation if the particles are not interacting .    in quantum mechanics , position and momentum operators do not commute and hence , in principle , one can not talk about a joint momentum and position distribution of particles .",
    "indeed the quantum mechanical wave functions depend on either spatial coordinates or momentum , but never both .",
    "nonetheless , wigner introduced the first quantum phase - space distribution just a few years after quantum mechanics was formulated @xcite .",
    "it is not positive definite and hence can not be regarded as a probability distribution .",
    "however , it reduces to the positive - definite classical phase - space distribution in @xmath90 limit .",
    "the sign oscillation in the phase - space is necessary to reproduce quantum interference .",
    "the wigner distribution contains the complete single - particle information about a quantum system ( equivalent to the full single - particle density matrix ) , and can be used to calculate any single - particle observable through classical - type phase - space averages .    in this section ,",
    "we first remind the reader some basic features of the quantum phase - space ( wigner ) functions .",
    "we then generalize the concept to the relativistic quarks and gluons in the proton . with the preparation in section",
    "ii , the construction is straightforward .",
    "however , the most general phase - space distribution we define is not measurable at present , and hence we proceed to make reductions by integrating out some dependent variables . after integrating out the spatial coordinates",
    ", we recover the transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions@xcite . upon integrating over the parton transverse momentum",
    ", we have the reduced wigner distributions depending on 3-space coordinates and feynman momentum @xmath6 , which are related to the gpds by a simple fourier transformation .",
    "therefore , the reduced quantum phase - space distributions are physical observables .",
    "there is a vast literature on the quantum phase - space distributions , and the wigner distributions in particular . in this subsection",
    ", we would like to summarize some of the salient features .",
    "suppose we have a one - dimensional quantum mechanical system with wave function @xmath91 , the wigner distribution is defined as @xmath92 where we have set @xmath93 .",
    "when integrating out the coordinate @xmath6 , one gets the momentum density @xmath94 , which is positive definite .",
    "when integrating out @xmath78 , the positive - definite coordinate space density @xmath95 follows . for arbitrary @xmath78 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the wigner distribution is not positive definite and does not have a probability interpretation . nonetheless , for calculating the physical observables",
    ", one can just take averages over the phase - space as if it is a classical distribution @xmath96 where the operators are ordered according to the weyl association rule . for a single - particle system ,",
    "the wigner distribution contains everything there is in the quantum wave function . for a many - body system",
    ", the wigner distribution can be used to calculate the averages of all one - body operators .",
    "sign changes in the phase - space are a hint that it carries non - trivial quantum phase information .    in the classical limit",
    ", the wigner distribution is expected to become classical phase - space distribution . for systems which are statistical ensembles ,",
    "the limit @xmath97 is often well - behaved . for example",
    ", for an ensemble of harmonic oscillators at finite temperature , the wigner distribution becomes the classical boltzmann distribution as @xmath98 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the wigner distribution for the @xmath99th excited state of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator of energy @xmath100 is @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 stands for the hamiltonian @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the @xmath99th laguerre polynomial . in the quasi - classical limit  vanishing planck constant and large quantum numbers  the oscillator wigner distribution turns into the generalized distribution resided on the classical trajectories @xmath105 , @xmath106 phase - space averaging with this kernel is equivalent to calculating observables using classical equations of motion .",
    "this can be easily understood from the semi - classical form of the wave function @xmath107 substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ qmwigner ] ) and expanding @xmath108 to the first order in @xmath109 , one gets the quasi - classical wigner distribution @xmath110 where the argument of the delta - function describes a family of classical paths .",
    "the quantum - mechanical wigner distribution is measurable .",
    "the actual measurement has been performed for a simplest quantum system  the quantum state of a light mode ( a pulse of laser light of given frequency)employing ideas of vogel and risken @xcite .",
    "it was extracted via the method of homodyne tomograhy @xcite by measurement of a marginal observable and subsequent reconstruction by the inverse radon transformation .",
    "recently this wigner distribution has been measured directly by means of the photon counting techniques based on a mach - zender interferometric scheme @xcite .",
    "other versions of the phase - space distributions are possible .",
    "they are all members of the so - called cohen class @xcite , with husimi and kirkwood distributions @xcite being its well - known representatives .",
    "the husimi distribution is a smeared version of the wigner distribution defined by projection of the wave function on the coherent state ( gaussian wave packet ) @xmath111 which is real and positive - definite . on the other hand ,",
    "the kirkwood function is complex .",
    "all these distributions are expected to reduce to the same phase - space distribution in the @xmath112 limit .      in this subsection",
    ", we generalize the concept of phase - space distributions to relativistic quarks and gluons in the proton . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the single - particle wave function must be replaced by quantum fields , and hence it is natural to introduce the _ wigner operator _ , @xmath113 where @xmath33 is the quark phase - space position and @xmath73 the phase - space four - momentum conjugated to the spacetime separation @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath115 is a dirac matrix defining the types of quark densities because the quarks are spin-1/2 relativistic particles .",
    "depending on the choice of @xmath115 , we can have vector , axial vector , or tensor density .    since qcd is a gauge theory , the two quark fields at different spacetime points are not automatically gauge - invariant .",
    "one can define a gauge - invariant quark field by adding a gauge link to the spacetime infinity along a constant four - vector @xmath60 , @xmath116 where we assume the non - singular gauges in which the gauge potential vanish at the spacetime infinity @xcite .",
    "clearly , the wigner operator depends on the choice of @xmath60 . while theoretically any @xmath60 is possible , experimentally @xmath60 is constrained by the probes .",
    "we have extended the wigner distribution to including the time variable .",
    "therefore , beside the dependence on the 3-momentum , there is also a dependence on the energy . for the bound states in a simple system such as those in a simple harmonic oscillator ,",
    "the energy dependence is a @xmath117-function at the binding energies . for many - body systems ,",
    "however , the energy - dependence is more complicated , as it reflects the distribution of the states after one particle is removed from the system .    for non - relativistic systems for which the center - of - mass is well - defined and fixed , one can define the phase - space distributions by taking the expectation value of the above wigner operators in the @xmath118 state . for the proton for which the recoil effect can not be neglected ,",
    "the rest - frame state can not be uniquely defined , as discussed in section ii . here",
    "we follow sachs , defining a rest - frame matrix element as that in the breit frame , averaging over all possible 3-momentum transfers .",
    "therefore , we construct the quantum phase - space quark distribution in the proton as , @xmath119 where the plane - wave states are normalized relativistically .",
    "the most general phase - space distribution depends on _ seven _ independent variables .",
    "the only way we know how to probe the single - particle distributions is through high - energy processes , in which the light - cone energy @xmath120 is difficult to measure , where the @xmath58-axis refers to the momentum direction of a probe .",
    "moreover , the leading observables in these processes are associated with the  good \" components of the quark ( gluon ) fields in the sense of light - cone quantization @xcite , which can be selected by @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the direction of the gauge link , @xmath60 , is then determined by the trajectories of high - energy partons traveling along the light - cone @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "therefore , from now on , we restrict ourselves to the reduced wigner distributions by integrating out @xmath125 , @xmath126 with a light - cone gauge link is now implied .",
    "unfortunately , there is no known experiment at present capable of measuring this 6-dimensional distribution which may be called the _ master _ or _ mother _ distribution .",
    "further phase - space reductions lead to measurable quantities . integrating out the transverse momentum of partons , we obtain a 4-dimensional quantum distribution @xmath127",
    "the matrix element under the integrals is what defines the gpds .",
    "more precisely , if one replaces @xmath128 by feynman variable @xmath129 ( @xmath130 , proton energy @xmath131  ) and @xmath132 by @xmath133 , the reduced wigner distribution becomes the fourier transformation of the gpd @xmath134 @xmath135 in the present context , the relation between kinematic variables are @xmath136 and @xmath137 . taking @xmath138 , the corresponding gpd has the expansion @xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the shorthand for the light - cone gauge link .",
    "the phase - space function @xmath141 can be used to construct 3d images of the quarks for every selected feynman momentum @xmath6 in the rest frame of the proton .",

    "they also may be regarded as the result of a quantum phase - space tomography of the proton .",

    "the quark wave function is ultra - relativistic and can be solved from the free dirac equation with spherical boundary conditions .",

    "the model can also be used to describe the excitation spectrum of hadrons @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where the boosted bag wave function has been constructed using a simple prescription . in principle , one can perform a fourier transformation of the gpds to calculate the bag - model wigner distribution .    however , we choose a simpler way to calculate the wigner distribution because the static bag has a fixed center .",
    "in fact , we can calculate directly from the wave function of quarks in the static nucleon just like in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the rational for this is that assuming the gpds are known , one can  correct \" the relativistic effects associated with the boosted nucleon to obtain a wigner distribution corresponding to the static structure , just like applying the relativistic corrections to extracting the static charge distributions .",
    "the wigner distributions calculated from a static bag correspond to the ones with some relativistic corrections applied .    as we have discussed in the last section ,",
    "we define the wigner distributions by the matrix elements of the wigner operators @xmath204 in the hadron states .",
    "in general , because of translational invariance , only the off - diagonal matrix elements between nucleon states with finite momentum differences provide the 3d @xmath33 dependence .",
    "however , in the static models such as the mit bag , the quark wave functions are solved in the rest frame of the nucleon which has no translational invariance from start . with them",
    ", the wigner distributions can be calculated as the diagonal matrix elements of the wigner operator for the model nucleon fixed at the origin of the coordinates .",

    "[ bagmodel ] , we have shown a sequence of densities at @xmath231 and @xmath232 . as the parton density indicates , the charge density is peaked around @xmath233 where the distribution is roughly spherical - symmetric .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that the bag model gpds have a small @xmath160 dependence . for smaller and larger @xmath6",
    ", the charge density can be negative .",
    "as @xmath6 increases , the distribution at the center of the bag becomes smaller .",
    "as @xmath6 further increases , the density there becomes negative .",
    "similar phenomena happens as @xmath6 decreases .",
    "because the bag boundary limits the distance of the spatial correlation , the small-@xmath6 distribution does not grow significantly as seen in experimental data .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced the concept of the quantum phase - space distributions for the quarks and gluons in the nucleon .",
    "these distributions contain much more information than conventional observables .",
    "in particular , various reductions of the distribution lead to transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions and generalized parton distributions .    any knowledge on the gpds can be immediately translated into the correlated coordinate and momentum distributions of partons . in particular , the gpds can now be used to visualize the phase - space motion of the quarks , and hence allow studying the contribution of the quark orbital angular momentum to the spin of the nucleon .",
