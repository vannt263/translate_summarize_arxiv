    "small oscillations about the stable equilibrium of a many - body ground state are quantized as bosonic quasi - particles or bosons . in various physical contexts",
    "the linearized equations of motion for such excitations are known as the random phase approximation , or rpa equations for short @xcite .",
    "concrete examples are furnished by the vibrational excitations of a solid , the spin waves of a magnet , the electromagnetic modes of an optical medium , or the density oscillations of a bose - einstein condensate .    constrained by the requirement of dynamical stability ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath2 of any vibrational or quasi - boson system of the mentioned kind must lie in a positive cone , @xmath3 , of so - called elliptic symplectic generators .",
    "it should be stressed that although @xmath2 is hermitian as an operator in fock space , the quantum - to - classical mapping sends @xmath2 to an rpa generator @xmath4 which is in general neither hermitian nor anti - hermitian as a linear operator on the classical phase space . in view of this , a distinctive feature of the set of elliptic generators @xmath5 is that they can be brought to diagonal form ( with real frequencies , corresponding to stable oscillatory motion ) by real bogoliubov transformations , i.e. , by conjugating with elements of the real symplectic group @xmath6 .    in this general",
    "setting , our goal is to investigate what happens with observables such as the spectral statistics and the transport properties when the bosonic system is strongly disordered . in particular , we wish to understand whether there exists some low - energy universality , possibly of an unusual type , due to the interplay between disorder and the geometry of the cone @xmath3 .",
    "( for example , a high degree of low - temperature universality is known to be observed @xcite in strongly disordered solids as well as amorphous or glassy systems . ) motivated by this question , in the present paper we initiate the study of a class of semi - realistic random matrix models for disordered bosons .    by construction ,",
    "the probability measures of the models we propose are supported on @xmath3 .",
    "thus , unlike @xcite , the unphysical behavior of runaway motion associated with complex frequencies is excluded .",
    "our rpa generators @xmath7 have the particular feature of being sums of a deterministic and a random part .",
    "for simplicity we focus here on models without time - reversal symmetry , although tr - invariant models of a similar kind can be treated with little extra effort . by using a variant of the efetov - wegner supersymmetry method",
    ", we will derive an approximation for the density of states of mean - field or self - consistent type , reminiscent of the so - called ` coherent potential approximation ' ( cpa ) @xcite .    in the longer term ,",
    "the goal is to develop a description of our disordered boson models by field theories of the non - linear sigma model type .",
    "( as is well known @xcite , such a description has proven very useful for the case of disordered fermions ) . in that formulation , universality ( if any ) is expected to emerge whenever the renormalization group flow gets attracted to a few - parameter manifold of renormalizable field theories .",
    "the plan of the paper is this . in section [ sect:2 ]",
    "we outline the basic setting and in particular , we review the notion of positive cone of elliptic symplectic generators . we also introduce the random models to be considered and give a summary of the analytical results obtained .",
    "section [ sect:3 ] is concerned with the derivation of the coherent potential approximation for our models . for pedagogical reasons ,",
    "we first discuss the zero - dimensional case in some detail .",
    "the extension to @xmath1 dimensions is given in section [ sect:4 ] .",
    "there we also show some results for the numerical solution of the cpa equation .",
    "in this section , we start with some background on mathematical formulation and describe a class of random models which are tractable by the superbosonization variant of the efetov - wegner supersymmetry method .",
    "we then give a summary of our analytical results , relegating the presentation of numerical results to the end of the paper .",
    "let @xmath8 be a set of creation and annihilation operators for bosonic quasi - particles with quantum numbers @xmath9 .",
    "( for example , @xmath10 might be a discrete set of momenta selected by periodic boundary conditions in a finite box . )",

    "this may be interpreted either as a linear hamiltonian flow on @xmath14 viewed as a classical phase space , or as a quantum time evolution on @xmath14 viewed as a subspace of the associative algebra of polynomials in @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( the so - called weyl algebra ) . in either case ,",
    "the dynamical equations are @xmath17 ( the bar means complex conjugation . ) in order for the canonical commutation relations to be invariant under the dynamics , we require that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 are the matrix elements of an anti - hermitian matrix @xmath21 , while @xmath22 are those of a complex symmetric matrix @xmath23 .",
    "altogether , these conditions mean that @xmath24 is the generator of a symplectic transformation .",
    "more precisely , defining the lie algebra , @xmath25 , of the complex symplectic group by the linear condition @xmath26 @xmath4 lies in a non - compact real form @xmath27 determined by @xmath28 it should be mentioned that this description is appropriate in the absence of time - reversal invariance . if time reversal is a symmetry of the physical system , then the time - evolution generator @xmath4 is subject to additional complex anti - linear conditions .",

    "alternatively , one may imagine that they arise as an approximation to the collective motion of an interacting many - particle system ; as a particular example we mention density oscillations of a fluid .",
    "in the latter case , equations ( [ eq : rpa ] ) go under the name of random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the characteristic frequencies of the dynamical system ( [ eq : rpa ] ) or equivalently , the single - boson energies of the hamiltonian @xmath2 , can be computed as the eigenvalues of @xmath4 . owing to the symplectic condition @xmath31 the characteristic polynomial satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath4 therefore come as pairs @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath4 lies at some random position in the real symplectic lie algebra @xmath34 , then its eigenvalues will typically be complex , since @xmath35 is neither hermitian nor anti - hermitian . in the present context ,",
    "however , complex eigenvalues are forbidden , as they correspond to the unphysical situation of unstable motion .",
    "in fact , the physical requirement of stability of the rpa dynamics dictates that the spectrum of @xmath4 must lie on the imaginary axis , so that the normal modes of the bosonic system are vectors in @xmath14 with periodic time dependence ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "moreover , the second - quantized hamiltonian @xmath2 in ( [ eq:2ndq ] ) must have a ground state in fock space . by standard considerations of linear algebra ,",
    "all these stability conditions are met if and only if @xmath4 lies in the set @xmath37 we refer to @xmath3 as the _ positive cone of elliptic generators _ in @xmath34 .",
    "it is a fact that every @xmath5 can be brought to diagonal form by a real bogoliubov transformation , i.e.  an element @xmath38 of the real symplectic group @xmath6 , which is defined by the condition @xmath39      in the present paper we consider rpa generators @xmath4 , or equivalently hamiltonians @xmath2 , which are a sum of two parts : @xmath40 the term @xmath41 is the deterministic ( i.e. , non - random ) part of @xmath4 . while the formalism developed below can in principle handle any choice of @xmath41 , the explicit calculations presented in section [ sect : apply ] will be carried out for a simple concrete model of @xmath41 with unit mass matrix and elastic constants given by a discrete laplacian .",
    "a precise description of the concrete model for @xmath41 is as follows .",
    "let @xmath42 be a cubic lattice in @xmath1 space dimensions and associate with each site @xmath43 the operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 for boson creation and annihilation , respectively .",
    "we then take the second - quantized hamiltonian to be @xmath46 where the sum for the second term on the right - hand side is over nearest neighbor pairs of sites @xmath47 of @xmath48 .",
    "such a hamiltonian is easily diagonalized by fourier transforming to momentum space .",
    "the spectrum of single - boson energies @xmath49 as a function of the wave vector @xmath50 comes out to be @xmath51 note that @xmath52 for small @xmath53 , which tells us that the speed of sound in units of the lattice spacing is @xmath54 .    by computing the rpa generator from the dynamical equation",
    "@xmath55 $ ] for @xmath56 and @xmath57 we obtain the expression @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the scaled lattice laplacian ( with diagonal part removed ) which has eigenvalue spectrum @xmath60 .",
    "next , we tensor up the model by introducing @xmath0 identical bands . mathematically speaking , we pass from the symplectic vector space ( for each @xmath43 ) @xmath61 to the tensor product @xmath62 and take the generator @xmath41 to be @xmath63 this means that creation operators @xmath64 and annihilation operators @xmath65 get an extra band index @xmath66 .",

    "the parameter @xmath90 is a measure of the disorder strength .",
    "we mention in passing that the model for @xmath91 with probability measure ( [ eq : meas ] ) ( and @xmath92 ) is equivalent to the random matrix model studied in @xcite by different methods .",
    "finally , we describe the generalization to an arbitrary lattice or graph @xmath48 . with each lattice site",
    "@xmath43 we associate one copy @xmath93 of the hermitian symplectic vector space @xmath94 .",
    "the total physical space then is the orthogonal sum @xmath95 .",

    "the full generator of the dynamics is @xmath7 where the deterministic part @xmath41 may in principle be any element of the positive cone @xmath98 . for concreteness",
    "we let @xmath42 and take @xmath41 to be the generator described in section [ sect:2.2.1 ] .",

    "the distribution for @xmath68 is given by the product distribution @xmath102      while our interest will ultimately be in correlation functions and transport properties , we here take a first step by studying the average resolvent of the time - evolution generator @xmath103 @xmath104 where the symbol @xmath105 means the expectation value with respect to the probability measure ( [ eq : meas - lambda ] ) . notice that by the symplectic property @xmath106 the resolvent satisfies @xmath107 , so @xmath108 is an odd function of the frequency parameter @xmath109 .",
    "because the support of our probability measure is contained in the positive cone of elliptic elements , @xmath3 , the eigenvalue spectrum of the random operator @xmath4 is always imaginary and @xmath110 is analytic in the right and left halves of the complex @xmath111-plane . in the following we assume @xmath112 .",
    "it is a standard fact that the local density function @xmath113 of the characteristic boson frequencies @xmath114 can be computed from @xmath115    we now come to our main result .",
    "fixing the ratio @xmath116 we take the large-@xmath0 limit of the model with dynamical generator @xmath7 on @xmath42 as described above .",

    "we briefly discuss some features of the solution in two extreme cases .",
    "there is only one relevant parameter , @xmath120 . in the limit of weak disorder ( @xmath121 ) one",
    "infers that @xmath122 and @xmath123^d } \\frac{d^d k }       { z^2 + \\nu^2 ( 1-\\delta_k)}\\ ] ] is simply the cauchy transform of the local density of frequencies of the deterministic generator @xmath41 . on the other hand , for strong disorder ( @xmath124 )",
    "the coherent potential @xmath125 becomes large and the system ( [ eq : g(z ) ] , [ eq : cpa ] ) simplifies to @xmath126 a special situation arises for @xmath127 . in this case",
    "it follows by a short computation from ( [ eq : rmt - limit ] ) that the scaled function @xmath128 satisfies an equation , @xmath129 which was derived and solved by lueck , sommers , and one of the authors @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite shows that the density of states behaves as @xmath130 near @xmath131 in this case .",
    "numerical results for @xmath132 and for the more general situation of intermediate disorder strengths will be presented in sections [ sect : rmt - limit ] and [ sect : apply ] .",
    "in the sequel we explain how to arrive at our main equations ( [ eq : g(z ) ] ) and ( [ eq : cpa ] ) . for pedagogical reasons",
    "we describe the method first for the simple situation of a single site ( the zero - dimensional case ) . throughout this section",
    "we let @xmath69 and @xmath133 .",
    "our plan is to compute the average trace of resolvent ( [ eq : resolvent ] ) by a variant of the efetov - wegner supersymmetry method .",
    "the first step of this method is to express @xmath134 as a gaussian berezin ( super-)integral . to get started , we use the elementary identity @xmath135 and then write each of the two determinants as a gaussian integral  using ordinary integration variables for the determinant in the denominator and anti - commuting variables for that in the numerator .    in the case of the ordinary gaussian",
    "integral , there exists a convergence issue because the elements @xmath35 have indefinite real and imaginary parts in general .",
    "it is therefore crucial that all our generators @xmath4 , constrained to lie in the positive cone @xmath3 , satisfy the inequality @xmath136 . to take advantage of this positivity property",
    ", we express the determinant as follows : @xmath137 note that owing to @xmath112 and @xmath138 , the @xmath139 matrix of operators in ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) has positive real part .",
    "next , we introduce symmetric complex bilinear inner products @xmath140 for each of the two vector spaces @xmath74 and @xmath14 .",
    "these inner products are consistent with the hermitian structures of @xmath74 and @xmath14 in the sense that , e.g.  for @xmath74 , the sesqui - bilinear form @xmath141 agrees with the hermitian scalar product of @xmath74 .",
    "we then express the reciprocal determinant @xmath142 as an integral over two complex vectors @xmath143 and @xmath144 @xmath145 where it is understood that we are integrating with the product of lebesgue measures for @xmath74 and @xmath14 .",
    "the normalization is chosen in such a way that @xmath146 .",
    "we emphasize that the integral ( [ eq : boson - det ] ) converges absolutely due to @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    in the case of the determinant itself",
    "we integrate in the sense of berezin ( i.e. , we actually differentiate ) with respect to two independent vectors @xmath149 and @xmath150 whose components are grassmann variables : @xmath151 again , it is understood that we are integrating with the flat berezin form , i.e. , the product of all partial derivatives w.r.t .  the grassmann variables .",
    "the bar in the present instance means nothing but independence , e.g. , of @xmath152 from @xmath149 .",
    "we now multiply the two gaussian integral formulas ( [ eq : boson - det ] ) and ( [ eq : fermion - det ] ) and take the disorder average inside the absolutely convergent integral to obtain @xmath153 this integral representation is a suitable starting point for further analysis .      next , we compute the disorder expectation value in ( [ eq : mz-3.6 ] ) . for that we introduce the quadratic quantities @xmath154 where @xmath155 is meant as a linear transformation from @xmath14 to @xmath74 with coefficients in the even part of a grassmann algebra , and similar for @xmath156 with the roles of @xmath14 and @xmath74 reversed .",
    "we then have @xmath157 by completing the square and shifting variables .    at this point",
    "we make the observation that @xmath158 depends on @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath149 , @xmath152 only through scalar products such as @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "these share the feature of invariance under the group @xmath164 of real orthogonal transformations of @xmath133",
    ". it will be useful to organize all these @xmath164-scalars into a supermatrix : @xmath165 two of the matrix entries vanish since @xmath166 and , similarly , @xmath167 . we also have @xmath168 .",
    "we further note the expression @xmath169 for the supertrace of @xmath170 .",
    "there exist certain linear dependencies amongst the matrix elements of @xmath170 . to describe them we need the operation @xmath171 of taking the supertranspose : @xmath172 with its help we can formulate the symmetries of @xmath170 as follows : @xmath173    we now arrange the remaining integration variables @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath150 , and @xmath176 in the form of rectangular supermatrices : @xmath177 more",
    "precisely , @xmath178 is to be viewed as a linear mapping from @xmath14 into the superspace @xmath179 with grassmann - even resp .",
    "grassmann - odd matrix coefficients on the even resp .",
    "odd positions of @xmath180 .",
    "it is easy to check the identity @xmath181 which lets us re - express our disorder average as @xmath182      the next step is to carry out the integral over @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath150 , and @xmath176 , thereby eliminating @xmath178 and @xmath184 from the calculation",
    ". this will be straightforward to do because the dependence on these variables is gaussian .    as a preparatory step ,",
    "we verify from @xmath185 the relation @xmath186 where @xmath187 by using the results ( [ eq : mz-3.10],[eq : mz-3.11 ] ) in equation ( [ eq : mz-3.6 ] ) we then arrive at our next formula : @xmath188 the integral on the right - hand side is still over the original variables @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath149 , @xmath152 in @xmath170 and @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath150 , @xmath176 in @xmath178 , @xmath184 .",
    "finally , by using a standard formula for gaussian berezin superintegrals we perform the integral over @xmath178 and @xmath184 .",
    "this results in @xmath189 the superdeterminant here is over the tensor product space @xmath190 .",

    "these are the components of the vector variables @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath149 , @xmath152 and the matrix elements of the supermatrix @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "such a reduction of the number of integration variables does not come for free but requires the integrand to be invariant under one of the lie groups @xmath195 , @xmath196 , or @xmath197 .",
    "there exists a version of superbosonization for each of these classical lie symmetries .",
    "as we have seen , our integrand is expressed in terms of quadratic invariants of the orthogonal group @xmath198 .",
    "therefore we now recall from @xcite the superbosonization identity for the case of @xmath164-symmetry .",
    "the @xmath164-superbosonization identity reads @xmath199 where on the left - hand side we integrate with the flat berezin form @xmath200 and on the right - hand side the berezin integration form is @xmath201 where @xmath202 is still the flat berezin form ( i.e. , the product of differentials for the even variables and partial derivatives for the odd variables ) .",
    "the domain of integration for the so - called boson - boson block @xmath203 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - p ] ) ] is the space of positive hermitian @xmath204 matrices @xmath205 subject to @xmath206 . in the fermion - fermion sector , the integration domain is the space of unitary @xmath204 matrices @xmath207 subject to the symmetry relation @xmath208 .",

    "a plot of the density of states for @xmath232 is shown in figure [ fig : rmt ] .",
    "we see that there is a gap at low frequencies .",
    "this feature can be understood in the same way as the marcenko - pastur law @xcite for rectangular wishart matrices .",
    "indeed , recall that our random generator is @xmath78 where @xmath233 is rectangular of size @xmath234 .",
    "the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath68 coincide with those of the operator @xmath235 but the latter has @xmath236 additional eigenvalues at zero by rank - nullity . in the large-@xmath0 limit the level repulsion due to this macroscopic number of zero modes produces a spectral gap of size proportional to @xmath237 .",
    "the gap closes as @xmath238 approaches unity , leading at @xmath127 to the situation investigated in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath239 it is the operator @xmath83 which by rank - nullity has @xmath240 zero modes , and the same goes for @xmath241 .",
    "therefore the density of states contains a dirac mass @xmath242 at zero in this case .",
    "a plot of the density of states for @xmath239 is shown in figure [ fig : rmt ] , where see that the dos approaches a finite value at zero frequency . (",
    "the argument of macroscopic level repulsion does not apply here , as the operator @xmath68 is neither hermitian nor anti - hermitian . )",
    "the discussion above is concerned with the so - called bulk scaling limit .",
    "another limit of interest is the edge - scaling limit at @xmath243 where one sends @xmath224 while keeping @xmath244 fixed . for @xmath127",
    "this limit was thoroughly investigated in @xcite , while for @xmath231 the situation is trivial because of the absence of states at @xmath243 .    for @xmath239 the edge - scaling limit",
    "was studied in @xcite .",
    "the hessian of the function @xmath245 at the saddle point @xmath246 has eigenvalues of order @xmath109 . therefore ,",
    "in edge scaling @xmath247 this saddle point is not isolated and one has to work with a whole supermanifold of saddle points .",
    "( technically speaking , the saddle - point supermanifold is a riemannian symmetric superspace @xmath248 of type @xmath249 . )",
    "the law for the density of states in the limit @xmath250 turns out @xcite to be the universal law for systems of class @xmath251 in the symmetry classification of @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath1-dimensional model described in section [ sect:2.2 ] .",
    "the procedure of deriving the coherent potential approximation ( [ eq : g(z ) ] , [ eq : cpa ] ) for this model remains essentially the same as before .",
    "again , our first step is to express the determinants in ( [ eq : mz-3.1 ] ) as gaussian integrals over vector variables @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath149 , @xmath152 for @xmath252 and @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath150 , @xmath176 for @xmath253 .",
    "the gaussian integral representation has the effect of factorizing the independent random variables associated with different sites of the lattice .",
    "the disorder average can therefore be carried out for each site separately . by the local @xmath164 gauge symmetry of the model ,",
    "the integrand after disorder averaging depends only on @xmath164 gauge invariant combinations of the fundamental variables @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath149 , @xmath152 . these organize into supermatrices @xmath170 as before .",
    "thus we introduce such a supermatrix @xmath254 for each site @xmath43 and switch to integrating over @xmath254 by the superbosonization formula ( [ bosonize1 ] ) . because the dependence on the variables @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath150 , @xmath176 is still gaussian , they can again be integrated out to produce a superdeterminant . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath255 where @xmath256 denotes the orthogonal projector from @xmath257 onto @xmath258",
    ". the only difference of any essence from our earlier result ( [ eq : final ] ) is that the integral now is over a field of supermatrices @xmath259 instead of a single supermatrix @xmath170 .",
    "the operator @xmath260 is diagonal on @xmath14 but ( for generic @xmath254 ) non - diagonal on @xmath179 . on the other hand ,",
    "the operator @xmath261 is trivial on superspace but couples the sites of the graph @xmath48 .",
    "the inverse square root of @xmath262 is raised to the @xmath263 power because each of the @xmath0 bands of the deterministic limit contribute the same factor .",
    "we now face the task of analyzing the model ( [ eq : final ] ) by the field - theoretic methods of gradient expansion and renormalization .",
    "( note that a closely related problem has already been tackled in @xcite . ) hoping to make progress with this in a future publication , we here take a first step by computing the local density of states .",
    "let us finally work out the mean - field solution of the model ( [ eq : final ] ) with deterministic generator @xmath264 as defined in ( [ eq : mz6 ] ) .",
    "writing the integrand as @xmath265 ( for @xmath266 ) we take the general variation of @xmath267 : @xmath268 for large @xmath0 we expect the field integral to be essentially given by a spatially homogeneous saddle point @xmath269 ( independent of @xmath43 ) and small fluctuations around it .",
    "therefore , after setting @xmath270 we look for solutions of @xmath271 of this very form .",
    "the variational equation @xmath271 then reduces to an equation of self - consistent mean - field type : @xmath272 where we have used the property that the laplacian @xmath59 is diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath273 in momentum space . by evaluating the trace of the matrix inverse",
    "we immediately arrive at equation ( [ eq : cpa ] ) . within this mean - field ( or coherent potential ) approximation scheme , we obtain the expression ( [ eq : g(z ) ] ) for the average resolvent trace @xmath110 .",
    "let us finish by showing some numerical results for the model in dimension @xmath274 . in this case",
    "the density of states from ( [ eq : mz-2.21 ] ) for the pure system ( @xmath275 ) is @xmath276 as is seen in figure [ fig : cpa ] , the van hove singularity at @xmath277 is still visible for @xmath278 ( and @xmath279 . as the disorder strength @xmath90",
    "is increased , the bulk of the spectrum is pushed to higher frequencies and a peak begins to develop at small frequencies ( see the plot for @xmath280 ) . at values of @xmath90",
    "much larger than the sound velocity @xmath281 we recover the random - matrix limit shown in figure [ fig : rmt ] .",
