    "<S> the resulting rate matrix can be derived microscopically within the born - markov approximation @xcite ( see supplemental material for details of the ohmic baths used here and a plot of the rate matrix @xcite ) . in order to achieve bose selection with @xmath87 we consider two baths , as sketched in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : chain]c is an example where , in contrast to the random - rate model , the number of selected states remains of order one ( while still being larger than one ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a fragmented condensate with a macroscopic occupation of each selected state .    as a striking signature for the selection of more than a single state , at the transition from @xmath75 to @xmath93 a significant steady - state heat flow @xmath91 from bath 2 to bath 1 </S>",

    "<S> the heat flow from bath @xmath111 into the system reads @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> this explains an increase by orders of magnitude from @xmath64 to @xmath113 when the transition from one to three selected states occurs [ since @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) for selected ( non - selected ) states ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the mechanism of bose selection might be used to design quantum devices working far from equilibrium that allow to switch the heat conductivity via the number of selected states .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider time - periodically driven quantum systems ( floquet systems ) with hamiltonian @xmath116 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when coupled weakly to a thermal bath , these systems can be described within floquet - born - markov theory @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the rate differences @xmath117 are independent of the bath - temperature @xcite . according to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : selected ] ) and ( [ eq : nonselected ] ) this implies that the selected states and their relative occupations are temperature independent , whereas the occupations of the non - selected states ( and thus also the crossover density @xmath34 ) are temperature dependent .    replacing the energy - inverted bath coupled to one end of the tight binding chain by a coherent periodic driving term @xmath118 with @xmath119 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we observe again both bose condensation into a single state  </S>",
    "<S> which one is controlled by the parameters  and bose selection of @xmath93 states .    </S>",
    "<S> two more examples that emphasize that bose selection is a generic and robust effect in open time - periodically driven systems are given in the supplemental material @xcite : the @xmath0-boson generalizations of the open kicked rotor and the open driven quartic oscillator of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chain]a and [ fig : chain]d , we can study the evolution of the occupations with respect to a parameter controlling the rate matrix . within the asymptotic theory ( [ eq : selected ] ) and ( [ eq : nonselected ] ) transitions of states between the groups of selected and non - selected states are triggered either by the occupation of a selected state approaching zero or by the occupation of a non - selected state diverging . </S>",
    "<S> both requires the fine - tuning of a single parameter . </S>",
    "<S> while at the transition point an even number of states is selected , after the transition again the generic situation with an odd number of states has to be recovered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a second state has to make a transition at the transition point , too . </S>",
    "<S> when approaching the transition point from the other side , this second state plays the role of the triggering one . </S>",
    "<S> one finds three types of two - state processes , examples of which are labeled by i , ii , and iii in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chain]a and [ fig : chain]d : the transition is triggered from one side by a selected and from the other one by a non - selected state ( i , @xmath30 changes by 2 ) , or the transition is triggered on both sides either by selected ( ii ) or non - selected ( iii ) states ( @xmath30 does not change ) .    in future work </S>",
    "<S> , it will be interesting to study the impact of , e.g. , dimensionality , particle reservoirs , disorder , and interactions on the effect of bose selection in non - equilibrium steady states . </S>",
    "<S> a concrete application of bose selection in a physical system is the quantum switch for heat conductivity proposed here .    </S>",
