    "supersymmetry ( susy ) remains one of the most attractive possibilities for new physics at the weak scale .",
    "it addresses the unnatural higgs boson mass , provides a viable dark matter candidate , and leads to the apparent unification of couplings at an energy scale not too far from the planck scale .    in its simplest incarnation , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "contains a puzzle .",
    "the superpotential contains a dimensionful parameter , @xmath1 : @xmath4 to achieve natural electroweak symmetry breaking , this parameter must be of order the weak scale , which is set by the scale of the susy breaking soft masses .",
    "there is no a priori reason to expect a relationship between supersymmetric and susy breaking parameters .",
    "this is the `` mu problem '' of the mssm , see @xcite for a review .",
    "one attractive solution is to forbid the @xmath1 parameter of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mudef ] ) , and to generate an effective @xmath1-term dynamically .",
    "the trick is to then arrange for the dynamics ( presumably connected to susy breaking ) to produce a @xmath1-term of the right size .",
    "one approach is to add operators suppressed by a high scale , i.e. the giudice - masiero mechanism @xcite .",
    "a second is to modify the low energy effective theory , adding an additional light standard model ( sm ) singlet state , @xmath5 .",
    "this is the approach of the next - to - minimal supersymmetry standard model ( nmssm)@xcite , where the @xmath1-term is generated via the superpotential term : @xmath6 when @xmath5 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , this yields @xmath7 .",
    "but what is the symmetry that forbids the bare @xmath1-term of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mudef ] ) ?",
    "one can appeal to a global symmetry ( e.g. , a @xmath8 , but such symmetries often lead to cosmological difficulties , whose solutions tend to destabilize the hierarchy@xcite .",
    "another possibility is to charge @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 under a new @xmath11 gauge symmetry . by taking the charges of the higgs supermultiplets such that @xmath12 gauge invariance can simultaneously forbid the bare @xmath1-term of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mudef ] ) while allowing the desired term of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mueff ] ) .",
    "this simple observation is perhaps one of the best motivations for building models with a @xmath11 gauge boson at the weak scale .",
    "suppose that the large hadron collider ( lhc ) discovers a @xmath0 gauge boson , presumably through the process @xmath13 .",
    "such a discovery would lead to a reprise of i.i .",
    "rabi s famous comment regarding the muon : `` who ordered that ? '' . for",
    "while @xmath0 gauge bosons are motivated by many extensions to the standard model , e.g. grand unified theories ( guts ) and string constructions ( see @xcite for references and a recent review of these and other motivations ) , it is difficult to motivate why the @xmath0 should appear at the tev scale .",
    "if , however , the gauge symmetry associated with the @xmath11 is what forbids the @xmath1-term , then the coincidence of the weak scale and the @xmath0 mass is explained . because @xmath1-term must be at the electroweak scale to explain natural electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath14 is of order the weak scale .",
    "assuming this vev dominates the @xmath0 mass , the @xmath11 is unbroken down to this scale as well . in this case , the @xmath1-term ordered the new @xmath0 .",
    "many studies discussing the measurement of @xmath0 properties exist in the literature ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "most focus on the detailed examination of leptonic final states or rare decays to gauge bosons . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possibility of observing the direct decay of a tev scale @xmath0 to higgsinos .",
    "such decays indicate that the higgsinos ( and hence the higgs supermultiplets ) are charged under the new gauge symmetry as necessitated by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : forbidcharges ] ) .",
    "these decays represent a smoking gun , perhaps the most direct way to show that the @xmath11 symmetry is related to forbidding the @xmath1-term .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review some model building considerations related to attempting to forbid the @xmath1-term via a gauge symmetry .",
    "we also introduce the benchmark @xmath11 model that will be used in the collider studies that follow . in section",
    "[ sec : collider ] , we discuss the possibility of observing the decays @xmath15 at the lhc .",
    "we rely heavily on decays of the type @xmath16 , a nearly background free channel . in section [ sec : implications ] , we discuss what can be learned from studying these decays , and whether we will be able to say definitively that the @xmath1-term is forbidden by the new gauge symmetry . finally , we conclude .",
    "while adding a @xmath11 symmetry to the mssm is a well - motivated method for initially forbidding and subsequently generating the @xmath1-term dynamically , it does introduce many model - building difficulties . charging the higgs bosons under the @xmath11 while simultaneously allowing yukawa couplings ,",
    "forces the sm matter fields to also be charged under the @xmath11 .",
    "this induces new conditions to avoid mixed - anomalies between the @xmath11 and the sm symmetry groups .",
    "it is challenging to satisfy these conditions while simultaneously maintaining gauge coupling unification and avoiding introducing new  @xmath1-like \" terms for exotic matter @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss this tension , along with other model building challenges before settling on a choice for the charges of our @xmath11 .",
    "to avoid disrupting gauge coupling unification one can restrict new particles to come in complete gut multiplets or to be singlets under the sm . canceling mixed anomalies",
    "indicates the presence of particles with non - trivial @xmath17 and @xmath18 charges .",
    "for example , the @xmath19 anomaly requires a pair of exotic quarks ( @xmath20 ) while the @xmath21 anomaly requires a pair of exotic leptons ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "one economical way to implement this new matter is by introducing new @xmath23 representations where the @xmath20s can have different @xmath11 charges from the @xmath22s .",
    "however , having @xmath20 and @xmath22 fields with different @xmath11 charges calls the simplest gut interpretations into question .",
    "if one chooses to introduce only one set of @xmath24s , the four @xmath25 anomaly conditions fix their @xmath11 charges .",
    "these new fields require a mass , via the vacuum expectation value of a new singlet(s ) . in turn , these singlets need a mass .",
    "also , the @xmath26 and the @xmath11-gravitational anomalies must be cancelled . almost without fail",
    ", this leads to additional sm singlets ( often with irrational @xmath11 charges ) @xcite .",
    "the model building can rapidly become baroque.s and @xmath22s must decay fast enough to satisfy cosmological constraints without introducing baryon number violation that would lead to a too  short proton lifetime .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for some discussions of these points within the setting of a particular model . ]",
    "the full implementation of the singlet / exotic sector can affect the collider phenomenology .",
    "after all , the singlet vevs all contribute to the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "if `` too many '' sm singlets get large vevs , the @xmath0 can be pushed to a mass that makes detailed observations difficult .",
    "also , these sm singlet  superfields , if light , can modify the neutralino sector .",
    "so , while there might well be interesting phenomenology associated with the implementation of a particular @xmath0 model , we choose instead to consider a decoupling limit of sorts where the singlets do not affect the details of the neutralino sector , nor are they present in the decays of the @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we assume all colored / charged exotics are sufficiently heavy , so that they are not produced in @xmath0 decays",
    ". it would be interesting to relax these assumptions . if light , the new exotics will present exciting phenomenological opportunities @xcite , including the possibility of long lived heavy colored particles , reminiscent of split supersymmetry or hidden valley models .",
    "one could potentially investigate @xmath0 decays directly to these states .",
    "we leave a detailed study of this possibility to future work .    here",
    "we recognize the challenges of embedding a @xmath11 symmetry in a consistent model , but will choose to be agnostic about the specifics of how these problems are solved . to readily achieve our decoupling limit , we will follow an approach loosely motivated by @xmath27 guts , taken , e.g. in the recent work of @xcite .",
    "for this model the charges of nmssm fields under the @xmath11 are given in table [ tab : zprimech ] .",
    "changing the charges of the fields under the gauge symmetry will affect the details of the phenomenology we discuss here , but will not affect the gross features  nor the basic fact that one should look for decays of the type @xmath2 higgsinos .",
    ".the benchmark @xmath0 charges used throughout .",
    "this choice corresponds to the @xmath28 charges where the right handed neutrino is neutral under the @xmath11 . [",

    "the susy parameter choices are those taken in sec .",
    "[ sec : onshellslepton ] .",
    "we have plotted 4 lepton events with a pair of os electrons and os muons from @xmath0 resonance neutralino decays .",
    "the x - axis and y - axis correspond to the invariant mass of the electron pair and the muon pair respectively .",
    "the charges can be found in table [ tab : zprimech ] .",
    "we have plotted 500 points for illustration .",
    "the solid lines ( labeled @xmath29 ) correspond to the expected kinematic edges for the masses given in table [ tab : mchionshellslepton ] .",
    "note the density of points in the lower left corner corresponding to large @xmath30 production .",
    "this is an example of a  box . \"",
    "]    -term is allowed by the @xmath11 symmetry , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "see figure [ fig : wedge - forbidden ] for a detailed explanation .",
    "the density of the points is relatively uniform out to the @xmath32 line , excluding the region where both invariant masses are beyond the @xmath33 line .",
    "this indicates sizable off - diagonal ( @xmath34 ) production .",
    "this is what makes a wedge a wedge . ]",
    "the applicability of this method depends on the details of the susy spectrum .",
    "the most pressing issue is that the wedge - box plot is created from the daughter leptons , not the neutralinos themselves .",
    "therefore , there is a danger that a box or wedge shape could be a reflection of differences in the branching ratio to leptons , rather than the production cross section from the @xmath0 decays .",
    "typically , however , the cancellation of the diagonal production is very effective in the case where the @xmath1-term is allowed .",
    "thus , the branching ratio to sleptons must be different by large factors to turn wedge - like plot into a box . for neutralino parameters similar to those considered in section [ sec : onshellslepton ] ( but for @xmath1-allowed ) , the branching ratio of the relevant neutralinos to leptons would have to differ by roughly two orders of magnitude in order to become a box .",
    "so , we can view the presence of a box as strong evidence that the @xmath1-term is forbidden in spite of this complication .",
    "in addition , it is not unreasonable to expect that one could learn about neutralino branching ratios from other samples of events , e.g. , cascade decays , and thereby illuminating this issue",
    ".    we now comment on the robustness of the conclusions that one can draw from these plots .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to get a wedge even if the @xmath1-term is forbidden . as a trivial example , note @xmath35 with @xmath36 small forbids the @xmath1-term but the @xmath0 dominantly decays to off - diagonal neutralino pairs .",
    "so , while the observation of a wedge - like plot does not say anything definitive about the status of the @xmath1-term , a `` box''-like plot is a strong indicator that the @xmath1-term is forbidden the gauge symmetry .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief discussion of two other observables that seem difficult to measure , particularly at the lhc , but potentially provide insight .",
    "for example , one might attempt to measure decays of the type @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "the relative branching ratios encode information about the @xmath11 charges of the higgs multiplets .",
    "however , while the observation of @xmath38 seems feasible , ( at least for the lightest higgs this was recently studied in the context of little higgs models @xcite ) , the other channels seem more difficult .",
    "furthermore , the extraction of information also depends on how close the higgs sector is to the decoupling limit .",
    "there is also the potential that mixing with the singlets of the @xmath0 sector could complicate the phenomenology .",
    "another potential observable is the angular dependence of the charginos in @xmath0 decays .",
    "the @xmath39 vertex is proportional to @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "an @xmath43 measurement could be used to determine @xmath44 and @xmath45 . when coupled with information about the chargino mixing matrices",
    ", this would give the charges of @xmath46 and @xmath47 under the @xmath11 .",
    "of course this would require isolating a sample of chargino decays , determining which specific charginos were being observed and then doing detailed measurements of their angular distributions . while this would be a difficult task , in principle",
    "this measurement could also tell us about the @xmath1-term , providing a consistency check with the higgsino and/or higgs measurements .",
    "if a gauge symmetry is responsible for forbidding the @xmath1-term , it is possible that one might be able to observe decays of the type @xmath2 higgsinos , via leptonic decays of the neutralinos .",
    "the ease with which this signal will be seen depends sensitively on the superparticle spectrum .",
    "if the signal is observed , kinematic information in the decays might be sufficient to determine definitively whether the @xmath11 forbids the @xmath1-term .",
    "other complementary approaches , involving measurement of the quark charges , or examining @xmath0 decays to higgs bosons and/or charginos might strengthen these conclusions .",
    "while in this paper we were primarily concerned with probing the higgsino charges under the new gauge symmetry , the @xmath0 potentially has another use .",
    "it presents a new source of higgsinos at the lhc , beyond those available in direct production and cascade decays .",
    "for example , in table [ tab : resultonshellslepton ] , we can see that the production of the higgsinos via the @xmath0 can far exceed direct production .",
    "( a similar point was made for sleptons in @xcite . )",
    "the @xmath0 can help us study parts of the susy spectrum that might not otherwise be readily accessible .",
