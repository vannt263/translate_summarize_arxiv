    "we will briefly discuss this example in sect .",
    "[ sect : lv ] . some further applications of this discretization have been explored in @xcite .",
    "the next , even more intriguing appearance of this discretization was in the two papers by r. hirota and k. kimura who ( being apparently unaware of the work by kahan ) applied it to two famous _",
    "integrable _ system of classical mechanics , the euler top and the lagrange top @xcite . for the purposes of the present text , integrability of a dynamical system",
    "is synonymous with the existence of a sufficient number of functionally independent conserved quantities , or integrals of motion , that is , functions constant along the orbits .",

    "discovered_. the `` derivation '' of integrals of motion for the discrete time lagrange top in @xcite is rather cryptic and almost uncomprehensible .",
    "the present paper aims at clarifying the hirota - kimura integrability mechanism and at its application to further integrable systems .",
    "we use the term `` hirota - kimura type discretization '' for the kahan s discretization in the context of integrable systems . in sect .",
    "[ sect : hk mechanism ] we propose a formalization of the hirota - kimura mechanism from @xcite , which will hopefully unveil its main idea and contribute towards demystifying at least some of its aspects .",

    "such a basis @xmath24 is a set of simple ( often monomial ) functions , @xmath25 , such that for every orbit @xmath26 of the map @xmath23 there is a certain linear combination @xmath27 of functions from @xmath24 vanishing on this orbit . as explained in sect .",
    "[ sect : hk mechanism ] , this is a _ new _ mathematical notion , not reducible to that of integrals of motion , although closely related to the latter . in sect .",
    "[ sect : finding ] we lay a theoretical fundament for the search for hirota - kimura bases for a given discrete time system , and give a number of practical recipes and tricks for doing this .",
    "we dare to claim that the results of @xcite concerning the discrete time euler top were originally discovered using the mechanism of hirota - kimura bases , and we present in sect .",
    "[ sect : det ] an attempt to reconstruct the way this discovery has been made .",
    "[ sect : clebsch1 ] contains the main results of this paper , namely the proof of integrability of the hirota - kimura type discretization for a further famous integrable system of the classical mechanics , namely for the clebsch case of the motion of a rigid body in an ideal fluid .",
    "our investigations are based mainly on computer experiments , which are used both for _ discovery _ of new results and for their rigorous _",
    "proof_. a search for hirota - kimura bases can be done with the help of _ numerical experiments _ based on the recipe ( n ) formulated in sect .",

    "if the search has been successful and a certain set of functions @xmath24 has been identified as a hirota - kimura basis for a given map @xmath23 , then numerical experiments can provide a very convincing evidence in favor of such a statement .",
    "a rigorous proof of such a statement turns out to be much more demanding . at present , we are not in possession of any theoretical proof strategies and are forced to verify the corresponding statements by means of _ symbolic computations_. however , direct and simple - minded symbolic computations turn out to be non - feasible due to complexity issues . as detailed in sect .",
    "[ sect : clebsch1 ] , the sheer size of explicit expressions for the second iterate @xmath28 of the discrete time clebsch system precludes symbolic manipulations , like solution of linear systems , as soon as those involve @xmath28 .",
    "therefore our main effort has been put into finding the strategy of a complete and rigorous symbolical proof which would avoid using @xmath28 and would stay within the memory and performance restrictions of the available software and hardware .",
    "the resulting proofs are _ computer assisted _ and are based on symbolic computations with maple @xcite , singular @xcite and form @xcite .",
    "our work was stimulated by a talk by t.  ratiu at the oberwolfach workshop `` geometric integration '' @xcite , where an extension of the hirota - kimura approach to the clebsch system and to the kovalevski top has been proposed .",
    "however , no valid derivation of integrals was presented in t.  ratiu s talk , so that the question on the integrability of these discretizations remained open .",
    "our work answers this question in the affirmative for the clebsch system ( actually , even for a whole family of hamiltonian flows generated by commuting integrals of the clebsch system ) . in the concluding sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] , we discuss further perspectives of this approach and formulate a general conjecture about the integrability of the hirota - kimura type discretizations ..",
    "as already mentioned in sect . [ sect : intro ] , w.  kahan applied his general discretization scheme to the famous lotka - volterra system modelling the interaction of the predator and the prey populations : @xmath29 solutions of this system lie on closed curves in ( the first quadrant of ) the phase plane @xmath30 , because of the presence of the integral ( conserved quantity ) @xmath31 actually , system ( [ eq : lv ] ) is hamiltonian with respect to the poisson bracket @xmath32 with the hamilton function @xmath33 : @xmath34 the majority of the conventional discretization schemes produce , when applied to ( [ eq : lv ] ) , spiralling solutions . compared with solutions of the original system , this is a qualitatively different behavior , cf .",

    "[ fig : lv ] ( right ) . a ( partial ) explanation of this behavior was given in @xcite , where it was shown that the map @xmath23 is poisson with respect to the invariant poisson bracket ( [ eq : lv pb ] ) of the system ( [ eq : lv ] ) .",
    "it is unknown whether the map [ eq : kahan lv explicit ] possesses an integral of motion , thus forcing all orbits to lie on smooth closed curves , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : lv ] ( right ) . some numerical experiments , via a deep zoom - in into certain domains of the phase plane , indicate that the map might be non - integrable , but a rigorous proof of a non - existence statement seems to be rather difficult .",
    "it might be possible with the use of technology described in @xcite .",

    "right : three orbits of the kahan s discretization with @xmath40.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in this section a general formulation of a remarkable mechanism will be given , which seems to be responsible for the integrability of the hirota - kimura type ( or kahan type ) discretizations of algebraically completely integrable systems .",
    "this mechanism is so far not well understood , in fact at the moment we do not know what mathematical structures make it actually work .    throughout this section",
    "@xmath41 is a birational map , while @xmath42 stand for rational , usually polynomial functions on the phase space .",
    "we start with recalling a well known definition .",
    "[ def : integral ] a function @xmath43 is called an * integral * , or a * conserved quantity * , of the map @xmath23 , if for every @xmath44 there holds @xmath45 so that @xmath46    * convention . * in the last formula and everywhere in the sequel , we use the expression @xmath47 for the evaluation of the function @xmath48 at the point @xmath10 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath49 and is used to spare some parentheses .",
    "thus , each orbit of the map @xmath23 lies on a certain level set of its integral @xmath50 . as a consequence ,",
    "if one knows @xmath51 functionally independent integrals @xmath52 of @xmath23 , one can claim that each orbit of @xmath23 is confined to an @xmath53-dimensional invariant set , which is a common level set of the functions @xmath52 .",
    "[ def : hirota mech ] a set of functions @xmath54 , linearly independent over @xmath55 , is called a * hirota - kimura basis ( hk - basis ) * , if for every @xmath44 there exists a vector @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for a given @xmath58 , the set of all vectors @xmath59 with this property will be denoted by @xmath60 and called the null - space of the basis @xmath24 ( at the point @xmath10 ) .",
    "this set clearly is a vector space .",
    "thus , for a hk - basis @xmath24 and for @xmath61 the function @xmath62 vanishes along the @xmath23-orbit of @xmath10 .",
    "let us stress that we can not claim that @xmath63 is an integral of motion , since vectors @xmath64 do not have to belong to @xmath65 for initial points @xmath66 not lying on the orbit of @xmath10 .",
    "however , for any @xmath10 the orbit @xmath26 is confined to the common zero level set of @xmath51 functions @xmath67 where the vectors @xmath68 form a basis of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , knowledge of a hk - basis with the null - space of dimension @xmath51 leads to a similar conclusion as knowledge of @xmath51 independent integrals of @xmath23 , namely to the conclusion that the orbits lie on @xmath53-dimensional invariant sets .",
    "note , however , that a hk - basis gives no immediate information on how these invariant sets foliate the phase space @xmath69 , since the vectors @xmath70 , and therefore the functions @xmath71 , change from one initial point @xmath10 to another .",
    "although the notions of integrals and of hk - bases can not be immediately translated into one another , they turn out to be closely related .",
    "the simplest situation for a hk - basis corresponds to @xmath72 , @xmath73 . in this case",
    "we immediately see that @xmath74 is an integral of motion of the map @xmath23 .",
    "conversely , for any rational integral of motion @xmath74 its numerator and denominator @xmath75 , @xmath76 satisfy @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and thus build a hk - basis with @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the notion of a hk - basis _ generalizes _ ( for @xmath80 ) the notion of integrals of motion .    on the other hand , knowing a hk - basis @xmath24 with @xmath81 allows one to find integrals of motion for the map @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , from definition [ def : hirota mech ] there follows immediately :    [ th : k_integral ] if @xmath24 is a hk - basis for a map @xmath23 , then @xmath82    thus ,",

    "this yields a simultaneous multiplication of all @xmath97 by the common factor @xmath100 . this operation does not change the quotients @xmath96 .",
