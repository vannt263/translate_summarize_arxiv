    "atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides semiconductors ( tmdcs ) @xcite are recognized as a material system which , due to its finite band gap , may have a complementary functionality to graphene , the best known member of the family of atomically thin materials .",
    "the experimental evidence that tmdcs become direct band gap materials in the monolayer limit @xcite and that the valley degree of freedom @xcite can be directly addressed by optical means @xcite have spurred a feverish research activity into the optical properties of these materials @xcite .",
    "equally influential has proved to be the fabrication of transistors based on monolayer mos@xmath2 @xcite which motivated a lot of subsequent research to understand the transport properties of these materials . achieving good ohmic contact to monolayer tmdcs is still challenging and this complicates the investigation of intrinsic properties through transport measurements .",
    "nevertheless , significant progress has been made recently in reducing the contact resistance by e.g. , using local gating techniques @xcite , phase engineering @xcite , making use of monolayer graphene as electrical contact @xcite , or selective etching procedure @xcite .",
    "our main interest here is to study magnetotransport properties of monolayer tmdcs .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively strong disorder in monolayer tmdc samples have to - date hindered the observation of the quantum hall effect .",
    "nevertheless , the classical hall conductance has been measured in a number of experiments @xcite and was used to determine the charge density @xmath3 and to extract the hall mobility @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , three recent works have reported very promising progress in the efforts to uncover magnetic field induced quantum effects in monolayer tmdcs .",
    "firstly , in reference  @xcite the weak - localization effect was observed in monolayer mos@xmath1 .",
    "secondly , it was shown that in boron - nitride encapsulated mono- and few layer mos@xmath1 @xcite and in few layer wse@xmath1 @xcite it was possible to measure the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations of the longitudinal resistance .",
    "both of these developments are very significant and can provide complementary informations : the weak localization corrections about the coherence length and spin relaxation processes @xcite , whereas sdh oscillations about the cross - sectional area of the fermi surface and the effective mass of the carriers .    here we first briefly review the most important steps to calculate the ll spectrum in monolayer semiconductor tmdcs in perpendicular magnetic field using a multi - band @xmath0 model@xcite .",
    "we show that for magnetic fields of @xmath5 t a simple approximation can be applied to capture all the salient features of the ll spectrum .",
    "motivated by recent experiments in mos@xmath1 @xcite and wse@xmath1 @xcite , we use the ll spectrum and the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) to calculate the sdh oscillations of the longitudinal conductance @xmath6 .",
    "we discuss how the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling and the valley degeneracy breaking ( vdb ) of the magnetic field affect the magnetoconductance oscillations .",
    "we also point out the different scenarios that can occur depending on the doping level .",
    "electronic states in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 valleys are related by time reversal symmetry in monolayer tmdcs and hence in the presence of a magnetic field their degeneracy should be lifted .",
    "( note that in the case of graphene the inversion symmetry , which is present there but not in monolayer tmdcs , ensures that in the non - interacting limit the lls remain degenerate in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 valleys . )",
    "recently several works have calculated the landau level ( ll ) spectrum of monolayer tmdcs using the tight - binding ( tb ) method @xcite and found that the magnetic field can indeed lift the degeneracy of the lls in different valleys . however , due to the relatively large number of atomic orbitals that is needed to capture the zero magnetic field band structure , for certain problems , such as the sdh oscillations of longitudinal conductance , the tb methodology does not offer a convenient starting point . on the other hand ,",
    "a simplified two - band @xmath0 model was used to predict unconventional quantum hall effect @xcite and to discuss valley polarization @xcite and magneto - optical properties @xcite .",
    "this model , however , did not capture the valley degeneracy breaking and was therefore in contradiction with the tb results and the considerations based on symmetry arguments .",
    "we first show that the vdb in perpendicular magnetic field can be described by starting from a more general , seven - bands @xmath0 model @xcite . to this end",
    "we introduce an extended two - band continuum model which can be easily compared to previous works @xcite .",
    "we then show a relatively simple approximation for the ll energies which will prove to be useful for the calculation of the sdh oscillations in section [ sec : sdh - osc ] .",
    "our starting point to discuss the magnetic field effects in monolayer tmdcs is a seven - band @xmath0 model ( fourteen - band , if the spin degree is also taken into account ) , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details . in order to take into account the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", one may use the kohn - luttinger prescription , i.e. , we replace the wavenumbers @xmath9 appearing in the seven - band model with operators : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the vector potential in landau gauge and @xmath12 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "note that due to this replacement @xmath13 and @xmath14 become non - commuting operators : @xmath15 = \\frac{2 e b_z } { \\hbar } , $ ] where @xmath16 is the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath17 $ ] denotes the commutator . working with a seven - band model is not very convenient and therefore one may want to obtain an effective model that involves fewer bands .",
    "this can be done using lwdin - partitioning to project out those degrees of freedom from the seven - band hamiltonian that are far from the fermi energy .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are non - commuting operators , it is important to keep their order when one performs the lwdin - partitioning . to illustrate this point we first consider a two - band model ( four - band including spin ) which involves the valence and the conduction bands ( vb and cb ) .",
    "we will follow the notation used in reference @xcite .",
    "one finds that the low - energy effective hamiltonian in a perpendicular magnetic field is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) denotes spin @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is the free electron term ( @xmath26 is the g - factor and @xmath27 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 describes the spin - orbit coupling in vb and cb ( @xmath29 is a spin pauli matrix ) and @xmath30 for the @xmath31 valleys .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath32 reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 here the operator @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 .",
    "the material specific properties are encoded in the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( band - edge energies in the absence of soc ) , @xmath39 ( coupling between the vb and the cb ) and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which describe the effects of virtual transitions between the vb ( cb ) and the other bands in the seven - band model . in general ,",
    "the off - diagonal material parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 are complex numbers such that for the @xmath8 valley ( @xmath49 ) they are the complex conjugates of the @xmath7 valley case ( @xmath50 ) . in the absence of a magnetic field , the material parameters appearing in eqs .   -",
    "can be obtained by , e.g. , fitting the eigenvalues of @xmath51 to the band structure obtained from density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we refer to reference  @xcite for the details of this fitting procedure and for tables containing the extracted parameters for monolayer semiconductor tmdcs . here",
    "we only mention that such a fitting procedure yields real numbers which depend on the spin index @xmath52 but do not depend explicitly on the valley index @xmath53 .",
    "( the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 can not be obtained separately from fitting the dft band structure , only their sum , @xmath54 can be extracted .",
    "fortunately , as we will see below , the effect of @xmath55 is very small in the magnetic field range we are primarily interested in . )    we note that a @xmath0 model , similar to ours , was recently used in references  @xcite to calculate the ll spectrum .",
    "there are two differences between our @xmath0 hamiltonian eqs .   and the model in references  @xcite .",
    "the first one is that higher order terms that would correspond to our @xmath56 and @xmath55 were not considered in references  @xcite .",
    "we keep these terms in order to see more clearly the magnetic field range where the approximation discussed in section [ subsec : ll - approx ] is valid . the second difference can be found in our @xmath57 and the corresponding hamiltonian used in @xcite .",
    "this difference can be traced back to the way the magnetic field is taken into account in the effective models that are obtained from multi - band hamiltonians . in references @xcite first an effective zero field two - band model was derived and then in a second step the luttinger - prescription was performed in this effective model . therefore the terms which are @xmath58 in the zero field case become @xmath59 after the luttinger - prescription . in contrast , as mentioned above , we perform the luttinger prescription in the multi - band hamiltonian and obtain the effective two - band model @xmath51 in the second step .",
    "the two approaches may lead to different results because the operators @xmath60 , @xmath19 do not commute and this should be taken into account in the lwdin - partitioning which yields the effective two - band model .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath51 can be calculated numerically using harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions as basis states .",
    "taking @xmath61 for concreteness , one can see that the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , satisfy the bosonic commutation relation @xmath67=1 $ ] .",
    "( for @xmath68 one has to define @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) . therefore one can calculate the matrix elements of @xmath51 in a large , but finite harmonic oscillator basis and diagonalize the resulting matrix .",
    "for a large enough number of basis states the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath51 will not depend on the exact number of the basis states .",
    "such a ll calculation is shown in figure  [ fig : lls - mos2-exact ] for mos@xmath1 and in figure  [ fig : lls - wse2-exact ] for wse@xmath1 ( we have used the material parameters given in reference @xcite ) .",
    "one can see that the lls in different valleys are not degenerate and that the magnitude of the valley degeneracy breaking is different in the vb and cb and for the lower and higher - in - energy spin - split bands .",
    "while the results in the vb are qualitatively similar for mos@xmath1 and wse@xmath1 , considering the cb , for mos@xmath1 the valley splitting of the lls is smaller in the higher spin - split band , whereas the opposite is true for wse@xmath1 .",
    "this is a consequence of the interplay of the zeeman term in eq .   and",
    "other , band - structure related terms which lead to vdb .",
    "( for mos@xmath1 the valley splitting in the higher spin - split cb ( purple and cyan lines ) is very small for the material parameter set used in these calculations and can only be noticed for large magnetic fields . ) one can also observe that in the cb the lowest ll is in valley @xmath7 , whereas in the vb it is in valley @xmath8 .    .",

    "we point out that these results qualitatively agree with the tb calculations of reference @xcite , i.e. , the continuum approach can reproduce all important features of multi - band tb calculations . a more quantitative comparison between our results and the tb results @xcite is difficult , partly because the details may depend on the way how",
    "the material parameters are extracted from the dft band structure and also because in the tb calculations the zeeman effect was often neglected .",
    "the ll energies can also be obtained analytically in the approximation where @xmath56 and @xmath55 are neglected .",
    "we will not show these analytical results here because it turns out that an even simpler approximation yields a good agreement with the numerical calculations shown in figures [ fig : lls - mos2-exact ] and [ fig : lls - wse2-exact ] ( see section [ subsec : ll - approx ] ) and offers a suitable starting point to develop a theory for the sdh oscillations of the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "in zero magnetic field , the trigonal warping term eq .   and the third order term eq .",
    "are important in order to understand the results of recent angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and in order to obtain a good fit to the dft band structure , respectively @xcite . however , as we will show for the calculation of lls the terms @xmath56 and @xmath55 are less important . to see this one can perform another lwdin - partitioning on @xmath71 to obtain effective singe - band hamiltonians for the vb and the cb separately . keeping only lowest order terms in @xmath72",
    "one finds that these single - band hamiltonians correspond to a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian ( with different effective masses in the vb and cb and for the spin - split bands ) and a term which describes a linear - in-@xmath72 splitting of the energies of the lls in the two valleys .",
    "therefore the ll spectrum can be approximated by @xmath73 here , the following notations are introduced : @xmath74 is an integer denoting the ll index , @xmath75 are the band edge energies in the vb ( cb ) for a given spin - split band @xmath52 and @xmath76 are cyclotron frequencies . in terms of the parameters appearing in eqs .  - , for @xmath50 the effective masses @xmath77 that enter the expression of the cyclotron frequencies are given by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath49 can be easily found from the requirement electronic states that are connected by time reversal symmetry have the same effective mass .",

    "the magnitude of these matrix elements is spin - dependent  @xcite .",

    "this is in agreement with numerical calculations based on multi - band tight - binding models @xcite . for the cb",
    ", the details of the derivation that leads to can be found in @xcite , for the vb the derivation of is analogous and therefore it will not be detailed here .",
    "we note that in variance to reference @xcite , we do not define separately an out - of - plane spin g - factor and a spin independent valley g - factor , these two g - factors are merged in @xmath82 .",
    "the response to magnetic field also depends on the free electron zeeman term .",
    "the spin - index @xmath52 to be used in the evaluation of the zeeman term in eqs .  - follows the spin - polarization of the given spin - split band . for mos@xmath1 ,",
    "the spin polarizations @xmath52 of each band are shown in figure [ fig : doping ] , other mox@xmath1 ( x=\\{s , se , te } ) monolayer tmdcs have the same polarization .",
    "for monolayer wx@xmath1 tmdcs the spin polarization in the vb is the same as for the mox@xmath1 , but in the cb the polarization of the lower ( higher ) spin - split band is the opposite @xcite .",
    "we are mainly interested in how the magnetic field breaks the degeneracy of those electronic states which are connected by time reversal in the absence of the magnetic field . using eqs .  -",
    ", the valley splitting @xmath87 of these states can be characterized by an effective g - factor @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the higher - in - energy ( lower - in - energy ) spin - split band . in the vb",
    "the upper index @xmath90 [ @xmath91 is equivalent to @xmath24 ( @xmath23 ) , but in the cb the relation depends on the specific material being considered because the polarisation is different for mox@xmath1 and wx@xmath1 materials .",
    "taking first the mox@xmath1 monolayers one finds that ( see also figure  [ fig : doping ] ) @xmath92 for wx@xmath1 monolayers @xmath93 can also be calculated by , whereas in the cb @xmath94 as an example the numerical values of the various g - factors defined above are given in table [ tbl : g - factors - mos2 ] for mos@xmath1 and in table [ tbl : g - factors - wse2 ] for wse@xmath1 .",
    "one can see that @xmath95 can be comparable in magnitude to @xmath96 .",
    "this explains why the valley splitting is very small for mos@xmath1 in the case of the upper spin - split band in the cb ( see figure [ fig : lls - mos2-exact ] ) , whereas the opposite is true for wse@xmath1 ( figure [ fig : lls - wse2-exact ] ) .    as one can see from eqs . and , @xmath82 depends explicitly on the band - gap @xmath97 of a given spin @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the parameters @xmath85 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 implicitly also depend on @xmath97 due to the fitting procedure that is used to obtain them from dft band structure calculations@xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath97 is underestimated in dft calculations and its exact value at the moment is not known for most monolayer tmdcs .",
    "therefore in reference @xcite we have obtained two sets of the @xmath0 band structure parameters , the first one using @xmath97 from dft and the second one using @xmath97 extracted from gw calculations .",
    "the calculations shown in figures [ fig : lls - mos2-exact ] and [ fig : lls - wse2-exact ] were obtained with the former parameter set .",
    "as shown in table [ tbl : g - factors - mos2 ] , the calculated g - factors depend quite significantly on the choice of the parameter set .",
    "while there is an uncertainty regarding the magnitude of @xmath82 , we expect that the g - factors obtained by using the dft and the gw parameter sets will bracket the actual experimental values . on the other hand ,",

    "the most likely scenarios in the vb and the cb are shown in figure  [ fig : doping ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "considering first the cb , for electron densities @xmath173 measured in reference @xcite both the upper and lower spin - split bands would be occupied .",
    "in contrast , due to the much larger spin - splitting , for hole doped samples @xmath170 would typically intersect only the upper spin - split vb .",
    "such a situation may also occur for n - doped samples in those monolayer tmdcs where the spin - splitting in the cb is much larger than in mos@xmath1 , e.g. , in mote@xmath1 or wse@xmath1 .",
    "for strong doping other extrema in the vb and cb , such as the @xmath174 and @xmath175 points may also play a role , this will be briefly discussed at the end of this section .",
    "we will have two main assumptions in the following .",
    "the first one is that one can neglect inter - valley scattering and also intra - valley scattering between the spin - split bands .",
    "clearly , this is a simplified model whose validity needs to be checked against experiments .",
    "one can argue that in the vb ( see figure [ fig : doping](a ) ) in the absence of magnetic impurities the inter - valley scattering should be strongly suppressed because it would also require a simultaneous spin - flip .",
    "a recent scanning - tunneling experiment in monolayer wse@xmath1 @xcite indeed seems to show a strong supression of inter - valley scattering . in the cb , for the case shown in figure [ fig : doping](b ) , the inter - valley scattering is not forbidden by spin selection rules .",
    "even if @xmath170 was smaller , such that only one of the spin - split bands is populated in a given valley , the inter - valley scattering would not be completely suppressed because the bands are broadened by disorder which can be comparable to the spin - splitting @xmath176 ( @xmath177mev for mos@xmath1 and @xmath178mev for other monolayer tmdcs . ) on the other hand , the intra - valley scattering between the spin - split bands in the cb should be absent due to the specific form of the intrinsic soc , see eq .  .",
    "we note that strictly speaking any type of perturbation which breaks the mirror symmetry of the lattice , such as a substrate or certain type of point defects ( e.g. , sulphur vacancies ) would ( locally ) lead to a rashba type soc and hence induce intra - valley coupling between the spin - split bands .",
    "it is not known how effective is this mechanism , in the present study we neglect it .",
    "the second assumption is that we only consider the effect of short range scatterers .",
    "this assumption is widely used in the interpretation of sdh oscillations as it facilitates to obtain analytical results @xcite .",
    "we note that according to references  @xcite , some evidence for the presence of short range scatterers in monolayer mos@xmath1 has indeed been recently found . while short - range scatterers can , in general , cause inter - valley scattering , on the merit of its simplicity as a minimal model we only take into account intra - valley intra - band scattering .    using these assumptions",
    "it is straightforward to extend the theory of ando  @xcite to the sdh oscillations of monolayer tmdcs .",
    "namely , as it has been shown in section [ subsec : ll - approx ] , for not too large magnetic fields the lls in a given band can be described by a formula which is the same as for a simple parabolic band except that it contains a term which describes a linear - in - magnetic field valley - splitting .",
    "then , because of the assumption that one can neglect inter - valley and intra - valley inter - band scattering , the total conductance will be the sum of the conductances of individual bands with valley and spin indices @xmath179 .",
    "this simple model allows us to focus on the effects of intrinsic soc and valley splitting on the sdh oscillations , which is our main interest here .",
    "following reference @xcite , we treat impurity scattering in the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) and use the kubo - formalism to calculate the longitudinal conductivity @xmath6 ( for a recent discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) . assuming a random disorder potential @xmath180 with short range correlations @xmath181 , the self - energy @xmath182 in a given band ( @xmath179 ) does not depend on the ll index @xmath183 .",

    "here we only give the final form of @xmath6 and compare it to the results of numerical calculations .",
    "as mentioned above , the situation depicted in figure  [ fig : doping](a ) , i.e. , when there is only one occupied subband in each of the valleys is probably most relevant for p - doped samples .",

    ". nevertheless , they can be important for the level broadening of the sates at @xmath31 because scattering from @xmath31 to @xmath174 does not require a spin - flip @xcite . in the case of other monolayer tmdcs",

    "the situation can be more complicated for n - doped samples , especially for ws@xmath1 and wse@xmath1 .",
    "for these two materials the states in the six @xmath175 valleys are likely to be nearly degenerate with the states in the @xmath31 valleys .",
    "therefore the @xmath175 valleys might be relatively easily populated for finite n - doping and , in contrast to the @xmath174 point , the effective mass is comparable to that in the @xmath31 @xcite valleys .",
    "therefore they may contribute to the sdh oscillations .",
    "they would also affect the level broadening of the @xmath31 valley states because scattering from @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) to three of the six @xmath175 valleys is not forbidden by spin selection rules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that in the absence of a magnetic field the six @xmath175 valleys are pairwise connected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore , taking into account only the lowest - in - energy spin - split band in the @xmath175 valleys , the lls belonging to the @xmath175 valleys will be three - fold degenerate : the magnetic field , similarly to the case of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 points , would lift the six - fold valley - degeneracy .",
    "the effective valley g - factors , however , might be rather different from the ones in the @xmath31 valleys . for n - doped monolayer mox@xmath1 materials",
    "the situation is probably less complicated because the @xmath175 valleys are higher in energy and are not as easily populated as for the wx@xmath1 monolayers . for mos@xmath1 monolayers , therefore , one can neglect the @xmath175 valleys in first approximation .",
    "in summary , we have studied the ll spectrum of monolayer tmdcs in a @xmath0 theory framework .",
    "we have shown that in a wide magnetic field range the effects of the trigonal warping in the band structure are not very important for the ll spectrum . therefore the ll spectrum can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator spectrum and a linear - in - magntic field term which describes the vdb .",
    "this approximation and the assumption that only intra - valley intra - band scattering is relevant allowed us to extend previous theoretical work on sdh oscillations to the case of monolayer tmdcs . in the semiclassical limit , where analytical calculations are possible",

    "<S> the effect of the non - parabolicity of the band - dispersion on the landau level spectrum is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent magnetotransport experiments , we use the self - consistent born approximation and the kubo formalism to calculate the shubnikov de - haas oscillations of the longitudinal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the doping level , the spin - splitting of the bands and the broken valley degeneracy of the landau levels affect the magnetoconductance oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider monolayer mos@xmath1 and wse@xmath1 as concrete examples and compare the results of numerical calculations and an analytical formula which is valid in the semiclassical regime . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly analyze the recent experimental results ( reference @xcite ) using the theoretical approach we have developed . </S>"
