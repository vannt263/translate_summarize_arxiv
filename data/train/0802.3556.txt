    "recent results from numerical relativity suggest that the merger of two rapidly spinning black holes ( bhs ) can result in a large recoil from the anisotropic emission of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this recoil , or `` kick , '' may lead to a number of interesting astronomically observable signatures , many of them much longer lived than the gravitational wave signal itself .",
    "some of these signatures are indirect , and depend on galactic dynamics effects involving the merged black hole .",
    "for example , low - density cores in the central regions of galaxies may indicate a kicked black hole that ejected stars as it relaxed back to the center via dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the merged bh is ejected from the galaxy , it may also leave behind a bulge without changing its mass or velocity dispersion , thus breaking the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation for a number of systems @xcite .",
    "the overall population fraction of central black holes may give a way of indirectly measuring the distribution of bh recoil velocities @xcite .",
    "another class of recoil observations depends on the direct electromagnetic ( em ) signature from gas accreting onto the kicked bh .",
    "the quasar that results may be spatially displaced from the galactic center @xcite , and its line spectrum may be doppler shifted relative to the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the em signal that would appear following a bh merger within a circumbinary gas disk , in which a central gap of gas was cleared out by the inspiraling bhs , but then is refilled on an inflow time after the merger .",
    "this scenario , independent of any recoil kick , could provide a soft x - ray counterpart to a lisa event on a timescale of a few months to years after the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the emission from shocks in a disrupted disk in a similar configuration to that of @xcite , but including a kick for the final bh . @xcite",
    "estimated the ( small ) luminosity generated by viscous dissipation associated with the passage of the gravitational wave pulse itself through a surrounding accretion disk . within this class of direct em emission models ,",
    "new speculation predicts the possibility of trails of gamma - ray emission from dark matter annihilation in the wake of the recoiling bh @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we also consider a circumbinary disk around an inspiraling binary bh system , but focus on the long - term afterglow emission from the perturbed disk . at the time of merger , the gas in the surrounding disk is instantaneously placed on eccentric orbits due both to the change in gravitational potential from gw energy loss and the recoil of the central bh .",
    "these perturbed orbits relax back to circular trajectories while conserving angular momentum but dissipating energy over a few orbital periods .",
    "because these disks are very optically thick , the dissipated energy will be radiated with a thermal spectrum , giving a warm yet relatively short - lived signal from the inner edge of the disk , followed by prolonged infrared ( ir ) emission from the outer regions of the disk .",
    "this signature differs from that predicted by @xcite and @xcite , who argued that there would be prompt emission in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray bands , based on calculations that do not include the disk opacity .",
    "our work also contrasts with previous efforts in that both @xcite and @xcite focused on em counterparts to lisa sources , and thus limited the total mass in the merger to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we relax this limit because observations suggest that the smbh mass function @xmath5 peaks closer to @xmath6 for redshifts @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , we also consider the lower mass range so that we can estimate the character of the afterglows produced by the smaller mass mergers that may produce gravitational waves detectable by lisa .",
    "for black hole masses of @xmath6 , the ir afterglow signature could last for hundreds of thousands of years and provide evidence of smbh mergers even without lisa signals . for reasonable pre - merger accretion rates ,",
    "the central gap cleared out by the inspiraling binary does not close for @xmath8 years , giving a unique signature with infrared luminosity comparable to that of a quasar , and virtually no uv or x - ray emission .",
    "similarly , unlike classical agn , we expect no compact radio jets or photoionized emission lines . using the anti - hierarchical bh mass function of @xcite and an estimate of the smbh merger rate @xcite",
    ", we expect a total merger rate of @xmath9 per year out to @xmath10 for total mass @xmath11 . due to the long lifetimes of such afterglows , as many as @xmath1 may be observable in the entire sky at any one time . within the fields and flux sensitivities of existing multi - wavelength surveys such as swire and cosmos",
    ", we expect that @xmath12 may be discernable today , but any candidates would require follow - up optical spectroscopy for positive identification .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ merger_model ] we describe a simple model for a binary merger including gw energy and momentum losses and the subsequent behavior of the perturbed circumbinary disk , with predictions of light curves and spectra . in section [ cosmological_model ]",
    "we combine these results with a cosmological merger model and calculate expected merger rates and distribution of afterglow spectra . in section [ observations ]",
    "we discuss the feasibility of observing such systems , and present our conclusions in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we begin with a circumbinary disk described by an inner radius @xmath13 , total bh mass @xmath14 , mass ratio @xmath15 , accretion rate @xmath16 , and an efficiency @xmath17 such that , if the disk extended all the way in to a single central black hole , the luminosity would be @xmath18 . for this efficiency",
    ", we can define a normalized accretion rate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "outside of @xmath13 , we describe the disk by a steady - state alpha model , with nominal efficiency @xmath21 and viscosity parameter @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to these assumptions is discussed in section [ discussion ] .    for a pair of bhs on a circular orbit with binary separation @xmath23",
    ", the inner edge of the circumbinary disk is located at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a function only of the mass ratio and exhibits a relatively small range around @xmath26 for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "interior to this point , gas either accretes directly onto one of the two bhs or , more likely , is ejected from the system , giving a gap of very low density inside of @xmath28 @xcite . when the binary separation is sufficiently small , its evolution becomes dominated by gravitational wave losses and inspirals on a timescale given by the leading - order quadrupole formula @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the reduced mass of the binary .    as the binary orbit shrinks",
    ", the inner edge of the disk follows closely behind , maintaining the relation @xmath24 as long as the inflow time is less than the inspiral time . for a standard alpha disk , the gas inflow time is given by [ e.g.  @xcite ] @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the orbital angular velocity",
    ", @xmath33 is the sound speed , and @xmath34 is the disk thickness . in the inner regions of the disk , where the pressure is radiation - dominated and the opacity is dominated by electron scattering , we have @xcite @xmath35 while in the outer , gas - pressure and scattering - dominated region , we have @xmath36 here we have employed scaled parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the radius in geometric units .",
    "the point where the disk transitions from radiation- to gas - pressure dominated can be estimated by setting @xmath42 , or @xmath43 scaled in terms of @xmath44 , the inspiral time is @xmath45    when the inspiral time becomes shorter than the gas inflow time at the inner edge , the binary separation decreases faster than the gas can move in , effectively decoupling the bhs from the disk , and the merger occurs soon after @xcite . for our nominal model parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath21 , and @xmath48 , the central gap in the disk",
    "is quite large : @xmath49 .",
    "however , we also find that for some system parameters , namely when @xmath50 is small ( thus a long inspiral time ) and the accretion rate is large ( thus a short inflow time ) , the inner edge of the disk is able to keep up with the gravitational inspiral up to the final plunge and no appreciable gap is formed .",
    "furthermore , we find that whenever a gap _ is _ formed , the inner edge is almost always within the gas - pressure dominated region of the disk , so we can solve for @xmath13 with equations ( [ t_inflow3 ] , [ t_inspiral2 ] ) : @xmath51^{5/13}.\\ ] ] ( note that in @xcite , the inflow time is taken to scale as @xmath52 , and they consequently find smaller values of @xmath13 , typically within the radiation - dominated region of the disk . )      at the time of merger , @xmath2 is reduced nearly instantaneously by a fraction @xmath53 due to gw energy flux , with @xmath53 typically a few percent .",
    "this mass loss is scaled to the symmetric mass ratio @xmath54 , normalized to numerical simulations of non - spinning bh mergers @xcite : @xmath55 this mass loss could be as high as @xmath56 for aligned , rapidly spinning bhs @xcite , but averaging over an ensemble of uniformly distributed spin orientations , we think the non - spinning estimate is reasonable .    for generic systems without special symmetries ,",
    "the resulting black hole also receives a linear momentum recoil with velocity @xmath57 .",
    "this recoil leaves the outer regions of the disk ( where @xmath58 ) unbound and significantly disrupts the inner regions . for the bound regions ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "an annulus of mass @xmath60 on an originally circular orbit at radius @xmath61 receives an instantaneous boost in energy relative to the merged black hole of @xmath62 in the unbound outer regions , the change in energy is simply the original binding energy @xmath63 : @xmath64    in the inner - most regions , where the mass - loss contribution to the energy gain is significant , it is possible that not all this added energy will be available for dissipation .",
    "this is because ( as pointed out to us by cole miller ) , in the perfect ( i.e. dissipationless ) fluid limit , fluid elements retain their initial angular momentum . with the new , smaller central mass , that angular momentum is too large for any bound orbit at their initial radius .",
    "if fluid dynamics enforces circular orbits in the long - run , individual fluid elements expend most of the energy they gained by the mass - loss on moving out to their new orbital radius , leaving only @xmath65 available for dissipation .",
    "however , the actual mechanics of this response may well involve numerous shocks in which considerable angular momentum mixing between different fluid streams can occur .",
    "the effectiveness of this mixing will depend on numerous considerations including the radial surface mass density profile , the rapidity of cooling , and the role of radiation pressure ( see below for further estimates relevant to the latter two ) , and its evaluation is therefore best left to future work .",
    "given this uncertainty , we have opted for the more optimistic scaling ( heating from mass - loss @xmath66 times the binding energy ) in the results shown here . however , we have checked that whether one adopts a mass - loss heating scaling @xmath66 or @xmath67 makes very little difference to our conclusions because it alters the afterglow at an interesting level only during the first @xmath68@xmath69  yr after merger , while nearly all the detectable objects will be seen at much later times .    for the systems we have considered ,",
    "the vast majority of the afterglow energy is released in the regions of the disk that are dominated by gas pressure ( typically @xmath70 ) , where the surface density is given by @xcite @xmath71 and the gas density is @xmath72 from here on , we use a fiducial radial distance of @xmath73 gravitational radii , corresponding to the marginally bound region of the disk for the largest expected kicks .",
    "strictly speaking , equations ( [ sig_r ] , [ rho_r ] ) assume that the opacity is dominated by electron scattering , but they are actually quite similar to the expressions corresponding to free - free / bound - free scattering . in practice , both opacity effects tend to be important ( and also dust and molecular opacities at lower temperatures in the outer - most regions of the disk ) and we find our pre - merger disks are extremely optically thick out to radii of at least @xmath74 . since the total energy released at each point in the disk is proportional to the surface density ( eqn . [ de ] ) , only optically thick disks will actually have enough mass to produce a significant amount of luminosity .",
    "moreover , because @xmath75 depends on @xmath76 only to the @xmath77 power and on @xmath2 only to the @xmath78 power , our conclusion that these disks have large optical depths should be valid over a wide range of possible conditions . as we will show below , even the abrupt heating that takes place after the black hole merger does not alter this conclusion .",
    "the change in energy given in equation ( [ de ] ) leads to a perturbed disk with eccentric , intersecting orbits .",
    "conserving angular momentum in each annulus , the gas relaxes back to a collection of circular orbits on a timescale of order @xmath79 as shocks due to intersecting orbits dissipate energy in the disk .",
    "we define the heating time as the time it takes for nearby eccentric orbits to cross . in the epicyclic approximation for small eccentricity @xmath80 ,",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath61 of a perturbed orbit is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the radius of the guiding center orbit and @xmath83 is the epicyclic phase .",
    "density caustics form when orbits with different @xmath82 overlap at the same @xmath61 : @xmath84 in the limit of small @xmath80 , we get a heating time of @xmath85 in the simplest case where the kick velocity is zero , the instantaneous gw mass - loss will excite the entire disk with a constant eccentricity @xmath86 , independent of radius . in the opposite regime where the mass - loss contribution to the eccentricity is much smaller than that of the recoil , the post - kick magnitude of the total specific angular momentum @xmath87 of a single fluid element relative to the merged black hole will be @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the component of the kick parallel to the fluid velocity vector , @xmath90 is the component of the kick perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "the semi - major axis of such a fluid element can be determined from its specific energy @xmath91 : @xmath92 combining equations ( [ l_fin],[a_fin ] ) , we find the perturbed fluid element will have a post - kick eccentricity of @xmath93^{1/2}.\\ ] ] this is an exact result for bound , keplerian orbits . for @xmath94 , we find the typical eccentricity scales like @xmath95 for planar kicks with @xmath96 and @xmath97 for kicks directed out of the orbital plane with @xmath98 and @xmath99 . while the final kick direction is not independent of its magnitude , the relationship is not well - known at this point @xcite , so for these simple estimates , we typically average over angles to get @xmath100 .    in practice ,",
    "when estimating the heating rate in equation ( [ t_heat1 ] ) , we use a combination of the mass - loss and kick eccentricities : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the average of equation ( [ e_kick ] ) over an isotropic distribution of kick directions .",
    "we further impose the constraint that @xmath103 everywhere in the disk , with @xmath104 indicating the unbound regions .    to calculate the light curves produced by the merger",
    ", we must first estimate the temperature , density , and optical depth of the perturbed disk . during the heating phase , shocks with characteristic speed @xmath105",
    "will be driven through the gas at each annulus in the disk .",
    "in much of the bound region , the shock speed will be roughly limited by the kick speed , a result confirmed by @xcite , who calculated the relative velocity of colliding geodesic particles on perturbed orbits , finding @xmath106 at early times and @xmath107 at later times . in the innermost regions of the disk , the gw mass loss ( neglected by @xcite ) will dominate the orbital dynamics , giving @xmath108.\\ ] ] in the unbound regions , the shock speed is limited by the orbital velocity , so @xmath109\\ ] ] everywhere in those regions . it should be noted that even if the shock speeds in the bound regions are much smaller than the kick speed , as suggested by @xcite , the total kick energy must still be dissipated eventually , and only the initial temperatures will be different .",
    "however , as we will see below , the post - shock disk should be quite optically thick to thermalization , giving robust spectral and light curve predictions independent of the specific heating details .",
    "assuming the pre - merger disk is relatively cold , the initial shocks heat the gas to a temperature @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mean molecular mass of the gas and @xmath112 is the shock velocity in thousands of km / s @xcite .",
    "this energy in turn will be transformed to radiation on the bremsstrahlung radiation timescale : @xmath113 where we have used the free - free volume emissivity given in @xcite .",
    "this timescale is much shorter than any dynamical time in the system , so we assume all the shock energy is converted instantly into radiation .    at the high temperatures prevailing immediately post - shock",
    ", the disk may no longer be optically thick to free - free absorption , but will still be highly opaque to electron scattering .",
    "where , as here , @xmath114 , the optical depth to thermalization is given by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the electron scattering and free - free optical depths , respectively :    [ tau_therm ] @xmath118    here @xmath119 is the mean free - free opacity calculated by averaging over a bremsstrahlung emission spectrum at temperature @xmath120 k. thus , for typical parameters , we expect the disk immediately post - shock to be marginally optically thick in terms of thermalization .",
    "when the parameters are such that the initial burst of free - free radiation is well - thermalized , the spectrum quickly evolves through absorption and reradiation to planck form . as it does so , the matter and the radiation reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature defined by matching the thermal energy density created by the shock to the total heat content of gas and photons : @xmath121 for any shocks with @xmath122 km / s , the thermodynamic equilibrium pressure will be completely dominated by the radiation .",
    "the equilibrium temperature is then @xmath123    the fact that the thermodynamic equilibrium is strongly dominated by radiation pressure has the consequence that only a small portion of the initially - radiated free - free emission need be immediately thermalized in order for the gas quickly to reach thermodynamic equilibrium . because free - free opacity at frequencies @xmath124 well below @xmath125 is @xmath126 ,",
    "even when the blackbody peak is at first not thermalized , sufficiently low frequencies are .",
    "thus , for those regions with @xmath127 , we can define a cutoff frequency @xmath128 below which the spectrum will be thermalized : @xmath129 if @xmath130 , the thermalized band will always be in the rayleigh - jeans portion of the planck spectrum .",
    "the total energy content in this low - frequency thermalized portion of the spectrum is given by @xmath131 when this is comparable to the energy in the post - shock gas , @xmath132 , the temperature of the matter must be reduced by a factor of order unity in order to supply the energy in the radiation , in turn raising @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) and therefore @xmath135 .",
    "further depression of the gas temperature follows , leading to a still wider bandwidth of thermalization .",
    "rapid approach to thermodynamic equilibrium is thus the end - result whenever the initial energy in thermalized photons is comparable to the gas energy .",
    "this condition of @xmath136 will be satisfied for all shock temperatures with @xmath137 for our fiducial parameters , the corresponding shock speed is so high  nearly @xmath138  km / s , roughly ten times the largest possible kick speed  that highly unusual conditions are required for this condition to be violated .",
    "furthermore , since the shock speed is limited by the orbital speed , and @xmath139 , only systems with extremely low accretion rates ( @xmath140 ) have any chance of avoiding rapid thermalization .",
    "but as we mentioned above , since the luminosity is proportional to the disk surface density ( and @xmath141 ) , we expect to observe only those systems with moderate - to - large @xmath76 in the first place !",
    "even if free - free absorption were not enough to thermalize the radiation , compton scattering could also do the job on a timescale roughly comparable to @xmath142 .",
    "this is because the characteristic compton-@xmath143 parameter at the post - shock temperature is @xmath144 in this case , the thermal energy of the gas is drained as the electrons scatter into a wien spectrum the large number of low - energy photons they have created by free - free emission .",
    "the timescale for this process is almost as fast as the free - free radiation cooling time itself because each low - energy photon receives on average an additional energy @xmath145 by subsequent inverse compton scattering .",
    "thus , by any of several processes , the very large column densities found in these disks ensure that thermalization is inevitable . after the disk is shock - heated and",
    "reaches a radiation - dominated thermal state , it will expand adiabatically to a post - shock scale height determined by hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath146 with the pressure and density given by @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "since the initial orbital energy of the annulus is @xmath149 , we can write the post - shock scale height as @xmath150 the internal energy of the perturbed disk is then radiated over a cooling time at each radius , which for optically thick , radiation - pressure dominated disks is given by @xmath151    the evolution of internal energy @xmath152 due to intersecting orbits of the perturbed disk is thus governed by @xmath153 which gives a radiated luminosity of @xmath154 thus , the luminosity grows linearly at early times , which is reasonable for crossing eccentric orbits , and decays exponentially at late times , appropriate for a diffusion process .    on top of this luminosity from the internal heating of the perturbed disk",
    ", we also assume that outside of @xmath13 , the disk continues to behave as in a steady - state accretion disk , removing energy and angular momentum from the gas , giving the classical accretion luminosity at each point in the disk : @xmath155 while the shock - heating and subsequent expansion of the perturbed disk may change the local accretion rate , we generally find the cooling time to be much shorter than the inflow time , so we continue to assume an overall steady - state disk model with constant @xmath16 at all radii .",
    "we anticipate that more detailed numerical simulations should be able to model the dynamic behavior of these perturbed disks in the near future .",
    "the local emission spectrum is taken to be a thermal blackbody with @xmath156 with @xmath3 the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "after the merger , the inner edge of the disk continues to migrate inwards on an inflow timescale , eventually closing the gap and forming a `` standard '' accretion flow in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "figure [ light_curves ] shows light curves for several events with @xmath157 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , but varying @xmath50 , @xmath57 , and @xmath76 . in all cases , we see an initial linear rise in luminosity as the gas near @xmath13 is first excited and then radiates its heat on a timescale of a few years . the peak luminosity is typically reached after @xmath158  yr , and the afterglow remains roughly this bright for @xmath159  yr . in the solid ,",
    "dashed , and dot - dashed curves , the binary mass ratio is unity , giving an inner edge of @xmath160 . in these cases , the inner gap is not closed until nearly @xmath161 years after merger . at that point ,",
    "the luminosity increases sharply .",
    "the reason for this abrupt behavior is that the inner edge of the disk moves in very slowly at large @xmath61 , then accelerates its inward motion as the gap closes , leading to a nearly instantaneous increase in total luminosity .",
    "the solid and dashed curves have @xmath48 , while the dot - dashed curve has @xmath162 . for a higher accretion rate , @xmath13 moves in slightly , and from equation ( [ sig_r ] )",
    ", we see that overall mass  and thus luminosity  of the perturbed disk also increase with @xmath76 .",
    "the solid and dot - dashed curves in figure [ light_curves ] correspond to a recoil of @xmath163 km / s , and the dashed and dotted curves have @xmath164 km / s . from equation ( [ de ] )",
    "we see that for the inner regions of the disk , where @xmath165 , the perturbations due to mass loss are greater than those due to the kick , while in the outer regions , the kick term dominates .",
    "the dotted curve has @xmath166 , which causes the inner edge of the disk to be closer in at the time of decoupling , so the delay before gap filling is also shorter . from equation ( [ e_gw ] ) , we expect a smaller gw mass loss , and so the initial heating rate is smaller . as can be seen from equation ( [ dl_rt ] ) , the inner disk lights up on roughly the same timescale as the @xmath47 cases despite having a smaller value of @xmath13",
    ". note that all cases eventually settle down to nearly the same luminosity after the gap closes because the luminosity in the normal agn phase is determined only by @xmath76 and @xmath2 .    in figure [ spec_time ] we show a time sequence of spectra from a merger with @xmath46 , @xmath48 , @xmath47 , and @xmath167 km / s ( the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ light_curves ] ) . over the first hundred years or so",
    ", the disk brightens as the perturbed orbits near the inner edge begin to intersect and dissipate energy .",
    "then , as the region of maximum dissipation propagates outward , the disk slowly dims and reddens , its radiation moving from the optical / uv to ir over thousands of years . as in figure",
    "[ light_curves ] , at around @xmath161 years after the merger , the inner gap closes , forming a `` typical '' agn with thermal emission peaking in the uv band .    at even later times , the situation becomes highly uncertain , as the system s behavior depends largely on the existence and state of gas in the outermost regions of the disk ( @xmath168 ) . even within this radius , it is not clear whether the gas can be described by a simple thin disk model as in @xcite . beyond @xmath169 ,",
    "the disk may become gravitationally unstable , but there appears to be significant observational evidence that complete fragmentation and collapse is avoided by some auxiliary heating mechanism [ @xcite and references therein ] . in our simple model , if there is in fact appreciable gas and thus emission beyond @xmath170 , it should appear as a steadily reddening peak in the far infrared , as might be extrapolated from the curves in figure [ spec_time ] .",
    "however , even if there is a significant amount of gas in these outermost regions , it will almost certainly be unbound after any appreciable kick ( orbital speeds at @xmath171 are a few hundred km / s ) , and thus inherently limited in its total available energy content .    to estimate the light curves and spectra we might expect to see from lisa counterparts with @xmath172 , recall that the total energy released in the afterglow scales like @xmath173 and the typical timescales vary as @xmath2 .",
    "thus the peak luminosity should be a factor of @xmath174 smaller than those plotted in figure [ light_curves ] and evolve on a timescale 100 times shorter .",
    "the surface brightness , however , which scales like @xmath175 , has only weak dependence on the total mass , so we expect lisa afterglows to have similar spectra , peaking in the near- to mid - ir over a period of a few years after the merger .",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath176cdm cosmology with @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and normalized hubble constant @xmath179 @xcite . at each redshift , we approximate the bh mass function by the anti - hierarchical distributions given by @xcite , extrapolated to redshift @xmath180 .",
    "we assume that each bh experiences an average of @xmath181 major mergers between @xmath180 and the present and that over this range , the merger rate per comoving volume is weakly dependent on redshift @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure [ nmerge ] shows the expected number of mergers with @xmath182 throughout the universe per observer year per unit redshift for @xmath183 ( in rough agreement with the lower - right panel of fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "all rates quoted below should simply scale linearly with this parameter @xmath181 .",
    "note that these merger rates are significantly lower than those typically quoted for lisa sources , which include a large number of smaller black holes ( @xmath184 ) at high redshift ( @xmath185 ) @xcite .    while the mass functions given by @xcite likely underestimate the number of low - mass agns due to observational selection effects , these systems are also much less likely to produce long - lived , bright afterglow signals .",
    "therefore , in estimating number counts , it is reasonable to use the observations of @xcite to normalize the high - mass portion of the distribution function , even though they may be interpreted in terms of anti - hierarchical evolution , and use the hierarchical simulations of @xcite to estimate the merger rates of these high - mass systems as a function of redshift . as mentioned above in section [ lcurves_spectra ]",
    ", even if the number of low - mass ( @xmath186 ) binaries is greater by an order of magnitude , their luminosities and lifetimes will also be much smaller than those systems with mass around @xmath187 , so the observable ir luminosity function should be rather insensitive to mergers involving low - mass black holes .    for a given merger ,",
    "we determine the masses by selecting two black holes randomly from the distribution @xmath188 given in @xcite .",
    "the kick magnitude is determined from the formulae given by @xcite , which agree with earlier estimates of @xcite for small to moderate kicks , but predict a larger number of extreme kicks above 1000 km / s .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution of bh spin orientations and set @xmath189 for all systems .",
    "recoil velocities generally scale linearly with the spin parameter , so should not be too sensitive to small uncertainties in this typical value . with regard to the spin orientation , @xcite recently argued that bhs embedded in a circumbinary accretion disk should rapidly align their spins with the overall angular momentum of the disk , which would in turn lead to much smaller recoil values . on the other hand , if the disk forms outside of the binary , we expect very little gas to actually accrete directly onto either black hole , and the bhs could very well maintain their original random orientations @xcite .",
    "while the vast majority of isolated smbhs are not active at any given time , the accretion rates for merging bhs may on average be much higher due to the inflow of gas after galactic mergers @xcite . furthermore , many models rely on the dynamical friction of gas disks to bring the bhs close enough for gravitational radiation to take over and merge within a hubble time  the `` final parsec problem '' @xcite .",
    "thus , we assume every merging system has a significant circumbinary disk , with accretion rates uniformly distributed in logarithmic space between @xmath190 and @xmath191 .    for each merger",
    ", we define the afterglow phase as the time during which the total luminosity in equation ( [ dl_tot ] ) is dominated by the shock heating due to the perturbed orbits and where the inner gap has not yet closed . in the bottom panel of figure [ nmerge ]",
    "we show the expected number of objects in the afterglow phase observable at the present time as a function of redshift .",
    "note that while the merger rate ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ nmerge ] ) decreases with @xmath192 , the redshifted time makes those events appear to last longer to us , and thus there should be more in the afterglow phase at any given time .",
    "additionally , due to the anti - hierarchical growth of smbhs , mergers at higher redshifts typically involve larger masses and longer afterglows .    in figure [ phi_l ]",
    "we show the luminosity function @xmath193 ( in units of number per comoving volume per log luminosity ) for systems in the afterglow phase in a number of different redshift bins .",
    "the distribution is remarkably narrow and constant in time .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this behavior .",
    "first , the bh mass distribution we use is peaked around @xmath187 and falls off sharply above @xmath194 @xcite . in the downsizing paradigm of cosmic evolution ,",
    "the number of smaller - mass bhs ( @xmath195 ) increases at low redshift , in turn giving a slightly larger number of low - luminosity afterglows , as shown by the black and blue curves in figure [ phi_l ] .",
    "however , these low - mass systems are also much shorter - lived in their afterglow phase , giving a strong selection effect against seeing them at any one time .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath76 is also limited by a selection effect : we consider only @xmath196 in our model because if @xmath76 is too low ( thus giving a low - luminosity , low - mass disk ) , the bh binary does not evolve quickly enough via dynamical friction with the disk to merge within a hubble time @xcite . if , however , @xmath76 is too large ( high - luminosity ) , the inflow time at the inner edge of the disk [ eqns .",
    "( [ t_inflow2 ] , [ t_inflow3 ] ) ] will be small enough such that no appreciable gap is formed and the afterglow is not readily identifiable . additionally , we see from equations ( [ de ] ) and ( [ sig_r ] ) that the total energy released is a relatively weak function of @xmath76 , further narrowing the range of luminosities .",
    "lastly , the mass ratio @xmath50 is likely to be close to unity for a similar reason : if it is too small , the gw inspiral time is longer than the gas inflow time and the gap is small and short - lived .",
    "this selection for large @xmath50 also favors higher kick velocities , which for spinning bhs are maximized when @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "because any single merger event spends the vast majority of its lifetime in the late , ir - dominated phase corresponding to the outer disk relaxation , the average system seen today should be characterized by the double - hump spectra shown as the orange and yellow curves in figure [ spec_time ] . using the cosmological model parameters from the previous section , in figure [ fnu_all ] we show a randomly selected sample of rest - frame spectra within @xmath8 years after merger .",
    "the solid curves correspond to those systems formally in the afterglow phase , when the luminosity is dominated by the dissipation from the kicked disk . for reference ,",
    "the dashed curve is from a system that has already closed its central gap and radiates as a normal agn in the inner regions .",
    "we find that , for the model parameters used above , the numbers of closed - gap and open - gap systems are roughly equal , with somewhat more closed - gap systems at low redshift , where the typical bh masses  and thus timescales  are smaller .",
    "closed - gap systems are essentially identical to `` normal '' agn , dominated by a thermal peak in the uv from the inner disk , along with a strong ir peak due to reprocessing of the uv by a surrounding dusty torus at large distance , which could easily be confused with the ir afterglow emission from the perturbed outer disk .",
    "thus , for identification purposes , we will focus on kicked disks where the central gap has not yet closed , so the emission is almost entirely in the ir . due to the lack of a central engine ,",
    "these systems are not likely to produce significant uv / x - ray flux or compact radio jets .",
    "furthermore , we expect their time variability to be quite low , since most of the emission is coming from the outer regions of the disk , where the dynamical time is hundreds of years .",
    "restricting ourselves to this sample of open - gap disks , in figure [ contn_snu ] we show the source counts in the sky over a range of observed wavelengths , plotting contours of @xmath197 .",
    "also shown in figure [ contn_snu ] are the @xmath198 flux limits from the wide - field , multi - band swire and cosmos surveys .",
    "swire has a total coverage of nearly 50 deg@xmath199 , so on the basis of figure [ contn_snu ] we might expect to find @xmath200 afterglowing sources in the swire field .",
    "the cosmos survey covers a somewhat smaller area , 2 deg@xmath199 , with sensitivity comparable to swire at 24 @xmath201 m , but significantly better at 3.6 and 8 @xmath201 m , so there may again be @xmath12 afterglow sources detectable in its field .",
    "the goods survey goes considerably fainter , to 40 @xmath202 at 24 @xmath201 m , but covers an area of just @xmath203 arcmin@xmath199 , giving an expected number of sources of only @xmath204 .    in order to distinguish these afterglow signals from other ultra - luminous ir sources ,",
    "we require very low flux limits from optical , uv , and x - ray observations . as an initial estimate",
    ", we might require an x - ray flux no greater than 10% of the total ir flux , corresponding to roughly @xmath205 ergs / cm@xmath199/sec for the typical afterglowing source within @xmath207 .",
    "this is well within the limits of the _ xmm - newton _ large scale structure and the _ chandra _ xbootes surveys , which together cover roughly 18 deg@xmath199 of the swire field .",
    "cosmos has somewhat deeper coverage with _",
    "xmm _ , as well as full _",
    "coverage with acs , so may be the preferable approach at this point .    as we can see from figure [ contn_snu ] , in the mid - ir ,",
    "the @xmath208 curves scale roughly as @xmath209 , giving a larger number of high - flux sources than a uniform distribution with no cosmic evolution ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "thus the number of potentially confusing sources should decrease with increasing flux , yet detection will require covering an observed solid angle that increases linearly with flux . in light of these trade - offs",
    ", we believe the best discrimination potential may ultimately come from an extremely wide - field survey , even if shallow . to estimate the distance and brightness of the high - flux end of the distribution , in figure [ contn_sz ] we show source - count contours as a function of redshift , finding that the majority of bright sources are indeed nearby , with @xmath211 .",
    "many ir / x - ray selected candidates are likely to be obscured agn with a high compton depth , which may be ruled out as afterglow sources by the detection of hard x - rays or compact radio jets .",
    "in addition to demonstrating a low level of x - ray flux , we may need optical spectroscopy to rule out the existence of line emission from uv excitation of the region around the agn .",
    "this may require targeted spectroscopic observations , focusing on candidates selected with the other criteria described above .",
    "we have proposed the existence of a new class of electromagnetic sources produced by the merger of two supermassive black holes and thus corresponding to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals in the observable universe .",
    "these objects are potentially observable today , long before any planned gw experiment might detect them .",
    "when surrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk , the two bhs can be driven towards merger via dynamical friction .",
    "eventually the gravitational wave losses dominate the evolution of the binary , shrinking the orbit faster than the gas inflow time , at which point the disk decouples from the binary , leaving an open gap of extremely low - density gas and negligible direct accretion onto the bhs .",
    "this decoupling is followed soon after by the merger of the two bhs , disrupting the gas disk by the energy and momentum losses in the gravitational waves .",
    "the perturbed , eccentric orbits then intersect , forming shocks and heating the disk , which then radiates its internal energy over a cooling time .",
    "the large optical depth in the disk ensures that however the heat is released initially , it will rapidly reach thermal equilibrium and should therefore emit primarily in the infrared over most of the afterglow s lifetime .",
    "furthermore , _ only _ systems with high optical depth will also have sufficient mass in the disk to produce significant luminosities from internal shocks .",
    "due in part to the large optical depths of the disks , these ir afterglow signatures could last hundreds of thousands of years for typical bh masses of @xmath212 . at some point long after the merger , the inner edge of the disk will migrate in towards the central bh , forming a normal agn and marking the end of the afterglow phase .    folding this perturbed disk model with a cosmological merger scenario ,",
    "we predict the expected event rate ( @xmath9/yr ) and total number counts ( @xmath213 ) for afterglowing disks observable in the universe today . considering only existing survey data from _",
    ", _ xmm _ , and _",
    "chandra _ , roughly @xmath214 open - gap afterglow systems may be detectable today .",
    "however , these sources would need to be discriminated from a much larger population of deeply obscured agn , either with hard x - ray observations or optical spectra that might rule out the existence of narrow - line regions characteristic of normal agn . with a large fraction of their luminosity coming from the outer regions of the disk , where the dynamical time is hundreds of years",
    ", we also expect to see relatively low levels of variability in their light curves .",
    "in addition to the observational challenges in successfully detecting and identifying these systems , there are also a number of theoretical uncertainties in the underlying afterglow model .",
    "most critically , the properties of the gas disk ( if it even exists ! ) at large radii will strongly affect the predicted light curves and spectra described in section [ lcurves_spectra ] .",
    "at this point , we have relatively little understanding of agn disks beyond @xmath215 , where much of the afterglow emission originates . even if the disk reliably extends out to @xmath216 , the gas accretion rate as well as the surface density and temperature in these regions may very well not be described by a simple @xmath217-disk model .",
    "although we have used a nominal accretion efficiency of @xmath21 and a stress coefficient @xmath22 throughout this paper , these parameters are also uncertain , although by no more than a factor of a few .",
    "they influence our predictions in only two ways : the total energy deposited in the disk and also the radiative cooling time are proportional to @xmath218 , so the total luminosity is independent of either parameter .",
    "the inflow time  and thus the lifetime of the afterglow phase  is proportional to @xmath219 , so uncertainty in @xmath217 of order unity could vary the total number of observable sources by a similar factor .",
    "as discussed above at the end of section [ cosmological_model ] , the uncertainty in @xmath76 may not be too great , since strong selection effects limit the likelihood of observing either very small or very large @xmath76 .",
    "however , if the loss cone of scattering stars in the galactic center can be continuously replenished , it may be possible to shrink the bh binary sufficiently through three - body interactions alone to trigger a gw merger without a circumbinary disk .",
    "if so , there may be additional black hole mergers without enough surrounding gas to be as bright as the ones described here . at the other extreme",
    ", there may always be such a large amount of gas driving the merger that no appreciable gap is ever formed in the disk , making the afterglow very difficult to distinguish from a normal agn .",
    "the simple model we use for merger rates is also uncertain by at least a factor of a few , but this should only affect the overall number counts of sources , and not directly change their appearance . however ,",
    "if the bh masses in any given merger are not really selected at random from the overall mass distribution function ( e.g.  comparable mass mergers are favored due to the shorter time from galaxy merger to bh merger ) , the number of afterglows will increase , since systems with large @xmath50 tend to fill in their gaps more slowly .",
    "finally , the distribution of bh spin orientations is still quite uncertain , and there may be significant evolution effects that favor aligned spins with relatively small kicks , in turn reducing the average luminosity of the afterglow population .    of course , wherever there are theoretical uncertainties , there are great observational opportunities .",
    "if numerous ir afterglows are successfully detected and positively identified as open - gap accretion disks , we can begin to use them as observational tools to probe smbh binary systems .",
    "some of the important questions that may be answered are : what is the distribution of bh spins and orientations ?",
    "what is the range of astrophysically relevant kick velocities ?",
    "what are the merger rates , total masses , and expected mass ratios for smbh binaries at various redshifts ?",
    "how far out do accretion disks extend and what are their properties at large radii ?",
