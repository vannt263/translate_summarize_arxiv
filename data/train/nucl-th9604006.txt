    "<S> , it is expected that a physical meaning be attached to the deformation parameter , but this is still a very challenging question . for an extensive review article on the subject , </S>",
    "<S> refer to @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are concerned with possible improvements that quantum algebras may add to boson expansions ( or boson mappings ) .    in the literature </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to find situations in which fermion pairs can be replaced by bosons . </S>",
    "<S> this is normally performed with the help of boson mappings , that link the fermionic hilbert space to another hilbert space constructed with bosons . </S>",
    "<S> of course boson mapping techniques are only useful when the pauli principle effects are somehow minimized . </S>",
    "<S> historically boson expansion theories were introduced from two different points of view . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the beliaev - zelevinsky - marshalek ( bzm ) method @xcite , which focuses on the mapping of operators by requiring that the boson images satisfy the same commutation relations as the fermion operators . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , all important operators can be constructed from a set of basic operators whose commutation relations form an algebra . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping is achieved by preserving this algebra and mapping these basic operators . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is the marumori method @xcite , which focuses on the mapping of state vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this method defines the operator in such a way that the matrix elements are conserved by the mapping and the importance of the commutation rules is left as a consequence of the requirement that matrix elements coincide in both spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the bzm and the marumori expansions are equivalent at infinite order , which means that just with the proper mathematics one can go from one expansion to the other .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on this second boson mapping method . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we briefly outline the main aspects of the mapping from a fermionic space to a quantum deformed bosonic space . once the deformation parameter is set equal to one , the usual boson expansion is recovered </S>",
    "<S> . then the simple pairing interaction model is used as an example for our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing hamiltonian is exactly diagonalized and the results are compared with the ones obtained from the traditional boson and from the q- deformed boson expansions . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the results for the second and fourth order hamiltonians .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we show a marumori type deformed boson mapping . </S>",
    "<S> we start from an arbitrary operator @xmath4 acting on a finite fermionic space . </S>",
    "<S> this fermionic hilbert space with dimension @xmath5 is spanned by a basis formed by the states @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> note that the usual brackets @xmath11 stand for fermionic states and the round brackets @xmath12 stand for bosonic states . from the above considerations , it is straightforward to check that = ( m|o_b|m ) . therefore , we notice that the mapping is achieved by the equality between the matrix elements in the fermionic space and their counterparts in the bosonic space . as examples , </S>",

    "<S> one can see that the fourth order curve lies closer to the exact result than the second order curve , as expected , once the full expansion converges to the exact result .    </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the exact result with the deformed second and fourth order expansions and the results are plotted in figure 2 . setting @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the second order expansion converges to the exact result and for @xmath45 the fourth order expansion also converges . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the deformation parameter is playing the same rle as all the rest of the truncated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> one does not have to go beyond the deformed second order boson expansion to obtain the exact result while the fourth order non- deformed expansion gives still very poor results , as seen in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the use of quantum algebras in boson expansion theories can be a very useful method in providing the same result as the complete series . at this respect , we believe that further investigations , like the consideration of the bzm method and also of other model hamiltonians , deserve some effort in the future .    0.45 in    this work has been partially supported by cnpq . </S>"
