    "there is growing interest in molecules formed by one alkali - metal atom and one alkaline - earth or rare - earth atom @xcite .",
    "in contrast to group i or group ii di - atomic molecules , these molecules have an unpaired electron that allows for manipulation of the x@xmath0 ground - state molecule with both electric and magnetic external fields .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that @xmath0 molecules are good candidates in which to explore controlled chemical reactions at ultracold temperatures @xcite .",
    "the unpaired spin in the ground state of these molecules should provide a new handle for the control of the reaction dynamics based on the interplay between intramolecular spin - rotation couplings .",
    "in addition , when placed in an optical lattice , these polar molecules can interact with each other via both electric dipole - dipole and magnetic spin - spin forces .",
    "it is therefore possible to engineer unusual forms of interactions for quantum simulation of lattice - spin models and topological quantum computing @xcite , controlled preparation of many - body entangled states @xcite , and high - precision measurements of fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "another interest in li - group ii molecules stems from prospects to achieve optical feshbach tuning of scattering properties in ultracold gases of the individual atoms without substantial loss of atoms from a trap .",
    "this photoassociative tuning , pioneered for homonuclear molecules @xcite , becomes possible due to the existence of long - lived excited molecular states near narrow intercombination lines of the alkaline - earth or rare - earth atoms . in turn",
    ", this might enable efficient ways to form gases of polar molecules without substantial loss by photoassociation .",
    "in essence , a two - photon optical feshbach resonance can be used to couple two colliding atoms to a vibrational level of the molecular ground state .",
    "the suppressed effect of excited - state spontaneous decay makes efficient coherent molecular formation possible .",
    "knowledge of the electronic and ro - vibrational properties of the molecules will help to find optimal pathways .",
    "characteristics such as the permanent dipole moments of the ground state will determine the anisotropic interactions between these molecules in an optical trap .",
    "some key theoretical predictions of the electronic structure and dipole moment of the ground and low - lying excited states of liyb @xcite and for the ground state of lisr @xcite have recently been obtained . other work has studied rbyb @xcite and rbsr @xcite . however , the physical origin of the chemical bond of these mixed species is not yet fully understood",
    ". continued theoretical advances are necessary to unravel the properties of these molecular systems .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , only the limg and lica ground states were experimentally investigated @xcite , which allows us to compare our predictions with experimentally obtained molecular parameters @xcite .",
    "there are several experimental groups working to achieve the formation of the liyb molecules at ultracold temperatures @xcite .",
    "an understanding and quantitative description of these molecules might help to define conditions under which these ultracold molecular systems can be created .",
    "our theoretical study is devoted to a systematic investigation of the x@xmath0 ground state properties of the polar li - alkaline - earth dimers such as libe , limg , lica , lisr , and the rare - earth dimer liyb .",
    "these are interesting and challenging systems as the valence electrons of the atoms form a relatively weak covalent bond @xcite .",
    "the alkaline - earth atom has a closed outer electron shell and a hartree - fock interaction energy results in a purely repulsive potential curve .",
    "we use the unrestricted ( u ) or partially spin - restricted ( r ) coupled cluster ( cc ) method with either single and double excitations augmented with pertubatively calculated triples ( ccsd(t ) ) or with single , double , and triple excitations ( ccsdt ) to treat the correlations of core and valence electrons .",
    "all approaches are used in conjunction with correlation - consistent basis sets .",
    "the dipole moment is calculated using a finite field approach with a four - point numerical differentiation formula .",
    "the calculations are performed with cfour @xcite and molpro @xcite suites of programs .",
    "presumably , the ccsdt method is more accurate in the description of the potential energy surface than the ccsd(t ) method , where triple excitations are treated perturbatively .",
    "the results of the unrestricted ( u ) method are more accurate than that of a restricted ( r ) calculation .",
    "the cc method is based on a single - reference configuration and is not suitable for molecules where multiple - configurations are relevant .",
    "a practical indicator of how well the cc method performs is based on t1 diagnostics @xcite .",
    "our calculation shows that t1 is small and varies from 0.015 to 0.035 .",
    "this indicates that a single - reference method is valid for these dimers .",
    "in fact , a small t1 for all interatomic separations implies that the long - range interaction potentials as well as the dissociation energies can be accurately described .",
    "our results include the ground - state potential curve , bond distance , harmonic frequency , dissociation energy , and permanent dipole moment for libe , limg , lica , lisr , and liyb . for completeness , we calculate vibrational energies of the ground - state potentials .",
    "due to limitations in computational resources we were not able to obtain results for all methods , basis sets , and li - x diatoms .",
    "the most accurate potential energy curves and dipole moments are presented in the figures and tables with the exception of tab .",
    "[ all_const ] , which compares molecular constants obtained with the various methods and basis sets .",
    "all potentials are corrected for basis set superposition errors ( bsse ) using the counterpoise procedure of boys and bernardi @xcite .",
    "the sign of the dipole moment depends on the position of the origin .",
    "we apply the following convention throughout the paper : the alkaline - earth / rare - earth atom is positioned at the origin and the li atom moves along the positive @xmath1-axis .",
    "a positive sign of the dipole moment corresponds to the charge transfer from the li atom towards the alkaline - earth / rare - earth atom .      there",
    "exist several theoretical calculations of the x@xmath2 electronic ground state of the libe molecule .",
    "jones @xcite used a density functional formalism based on a local density approximation to predict molecular constants of the libe , limg , and lica molecules .",
    "their dissociation energy is @xmath3 = 3705.9 @xmath4 , while the equilibrium bond length @xmath5 is @xmath6 and the vibrational constant @xmath7 = 340 @xmath4 .",
    "such strong bonding of the libe molecule was explained by substantial electron - charge transfer between s and p orbitals .",
    "more advanced mrci calculations of the low - lying doublet and quartet states of libe was performed by fischer _",
    "_ @xcite . in this calculation",
    "the ground state is bound by 2497.5 @xmath4 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7 = 302 @xmath4 .",
    "the permanent dipole moment is @xmath9 = 0.95 a.u . at @xmath5 .",
    "another mrci calculation @xcite using all single and double excitations obtained @xmath3 = 2336.35 @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and @xmath7 = 300 @xmath4 , which are close to those of ref .",
    "however , the dipole moment @xmath11 a.u . of ref .",
    "@xcite differs significantly from that of ref .",
    "the effect of inner - shell correlations on the molecular electronic structure was investigated .",
    "later an _ ab  initio _ configuration - interaction study was reported by marino and ermler @xcite .",
    "their value of the dissociation energy @xmath3=2014 @xmath4 is smaller than that in previous studies . in summary ,",
    "the previous theoretical calculations disagree on dissociation energy and dipole moment values but have much better agreement on the value of the bond length .",
    "our goal is to test results of the previous predictions by performing a coupled cluster calculation accounting for high - order correlation effects .",
    "ground - state potential of libe ; bottom panel : permanent dipole moment function of the ground state of libe .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the equilibrium separation of the ground state potential , at which the dipole moment equals 1.41 a.u .",
    "the vibrationally - averaged dipole moment of the @xmath12 level is equal to a slightly smaller value of 1.372 a.u . ]    in our calculation the uccsd(t ) method is used to obtain the ground state potential and dipole moment of libe as a function of interatomic separation @xmath13 .",
    "these characteristics are calculated with the large basis set ( aug - cc - pv5z - dk ) of prascher _ et al _",
    "@xcite , which includes scalar relativistic effects accounted for by the douglass - kroll hamiltonian .",
    "atomic basis sets include ( 15s8p5d4f3g2h ) primitive gaussian and [ 7s6p5d4f3g2h ] constructed functions for li and ( 15s9p5d4f3g2h)/[7s6p5d4f3g2h ] for be .",
    "results of our calculation are shown in figure  [ li_be ] .",
    "comparing our data with results available from other theories and experiment we conclude that @xmath14 is close to the experimental measurement of @xmath15 @xcite , while the well depth @xmath3 = 2406.89 @xmath4 is in best agreement with the prediction of @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite no value of @xmath16 is given .",
    "the dipole moment value @xmath9 = 1.41 a.u .",
    "at the equilibrium separation is even larger than that of @xcite .",
    "the permanent dipole moment averaged over the ground state vibrational wave function is equal to 1.37 a.u .",
    "it is slightly lower than the value of the dipole moment function at @xmath17 .",
    "the libe molecule has the largest dipole moment of the molecular systems considered in this work .",

    "comparison of our most accurate ( either uccsd(t ) or uccsdt ) calculations with existing experimental measurements of the molecular constants shows that we are able to reproduce the bond length ( @xmath5 ) , harmonic frequency ( @xmath24 ) , and dissociation energy ( @xmath16 ) within 5% , 8% , and 6% , respectively .",
    "the dipole moment as a function @xmath13 is calculated in terms of a charge transfer and induced charge transfer .",
    "these two contributions have opposite signs over a large range of internuclear separations .",
    "we conclude from our calculations that charge transfer from the li - atom to the alkaline - earth atom prevails at all separations .",
    "this trend is reversed for liyb at @xmath25 .",
    "we also highlight the importance of the correlation effects in calculations of the alkali - alkaline - earth molecules .",
    "we have gathered numerical evidence to show that molecular constants of these molecules , such as dissociation energy and permanent dipole moment of the ground state , are extremely sensitive to high order correlations .",
    "we believe that the best values of these characteristics are obtained by using the uccsdt method , where correlation effects are taken into account at all orders .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that libe and limg are not likely candidates for ultracold studies because of the difficulty of cooling be or mg .",
    "however , lica looks quite promising , since a ca bec @xcite has been made , and its dipole moment is comparable to the known rbcs case @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 ground state gives an extra spin degree of freedom relative to the @xmath26 rbcs species , thus more quantum control possibilities .",
    "while ultracold li + sr and li + yb mixtures are possible for making the molecules , the dipole moments of the ground state molecules are rather modest . it remains to be determined how best to make the molecules from the trapped atoms .",
    "one possibility is to make `` preformed pairs '' in a dual species optical lattice @xcite , and then use intercombination line photoassociation followed by stirap @xcite .",
    "although all of these molecular species are expected to be highly chemical reactive in their ground states since the formation of the dimers is exotermic lica might have a large enough dipole moment to allow it to be protected against destructive collisions by aligning it with an electric field in a 1d optical lattice @xcite .",
