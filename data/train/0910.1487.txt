    "0.5 in    although sparsely studied so far , radio - intermediate quasars ( riqs ) can serve as an important tool for probing the relationship between the radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) , blazars and radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs , also termed as radio weak quasars ) .",
    "ever since the discovery of quasars , the dichotomy in their radio loudness has been debated as an outstanding issue , since about @xmath7 of optically selected quasars are found to be stronger emitters in the radio band compared to the remaining population ( sandage 1965 ; strittmatter et al .",
    "1980 ; kellermann et al .",
    "1989 , 1994 ; stocke et al .",
    "following kellermann et al .",
    "( 1989 ) who made vla observations of optically selected palomar - green bright quasar survey ( bqs ) objects , radio loudness is usually quantified in terms of a parameter ` @xmath8 ' , the ratio of continuum flux density at radio ( 5 ghz ) and optical ( 4400  ) wavelengths .",
    "the histogram of @xmath8 found in their study shows a large peak at @xmath9 and a second , weaker peak at @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , quasars falling in the range @xmath11 can be termed as `` radio intermediate quasars ( riqs ) '' ( e.g. , miller , rawlings & saunders 1993 ; see also , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "although it has been argued that rlqs are merely the tail of a broad distribution of quasar radio strengths and not a separate population ( e.g. , cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003 ) careful analysis of the largest available samples strongly indicates that there is indeed a bimodal distribution in @xmath8 ( ivezi et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) and that the radio loud fraction increases with rising optical luminosity but decreases with increasing redshift ( e.g. , jiang et al . 2007 ; rafter , crenshaw & wiita 2009 ) .",
    "the observed radio luminosity of a riq is typically well above the value dividing the fanaroff - riley type i ( fri ) and type ii ( frii ) radio galaxies [ log@xmath12 ( w / hz ) @xmath13 ( falcke , gopal - krishna & biermann 1995b ) , but probably not so once the possibility of relativistic flux boosting is taken into account ( e.g. , wang et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it has been long been suggested that riqs are doppler boosted counterparts of rqqs , such that the relativistic jet is closely aligned to the line of sight .",
    "this was mainly inferred from the radio versus [ o iii ] line intensity diagram for optically selected quasars and also from the high brightness temperature of the radio emission from riqs , as well as their usually flat or inverted radio spectra and substantial radio flux variability ( miller , rawlings & saunders 1993 ; falcke , gopal - krishna & biermann 1995b ; falcke , patnaik & sherwood 1996a ; xu et al . 1999",
    "barvainis et al .",
    "2005 ; falcke et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "implicit in this paradigm is the presence of relativistic jets in rqqs .",
    "this premise has received considerable support from deep radio imaging , which has revealed faint kpc - scale radio structures in several rqqs ( e.g. , kellermann et al .",
    "1994 ; blundell & rawlings 2001 ; leipski et al .",
    "in addition , blundell , beasly & bicknell ( 2003 ) have reported evidence for a highly relativistic parsec scale radio jet in the rqq pg1407 + 263 .",
    "independent support for the possibility of rqqs possessing relativistic jets has come from the observations of intranight optical micro - variability in rqqs ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ; gupta and joshi 2005 ; czerny et al .",
    "2008 ) and in their weaker cousins , seyfert 1 galaxies ( jang & miller 1995 , 1997 ; carini , noble & miller 2003 ) .",
    "at least a modest amount of relativistic beaming in the jets of radio weak quasars has also been inferred from the detection of compact cores on vlbi scales and radio variability on month - like to year - like timescales , indicating minimum brightness temperatures in a broad range from @xmath14@xmath15 k ( e.g. , ulvestad , antonucci & barvainis 2005 ; barvainis et al . 2005 ; wang et al .",
    ". however , there is at present little clarity about the nature of jets in rqqs _ vis -  - vis _ those in rlqs and blazars whose jets are widely attributed to spinning super massive black holes ( smbhs ) ( blandford 1990 and references therein ; wilson & colbert 1995 ) , or more massive smbhs accreting at smaller fraction of the eddington rate ( e.g. , boroson 2002 ) . a number of authors have drawn an analogy between the radio emission of quasars and x - ray binaries and have attributed the main difference between rlqs and rqqs to different accretion modes changing the nature of their jets ( e.g. , krding , jester & fender 2006 ) .",
    "stellar mass black holes are known to slide into a state where radio emission is strongly suppressed or quenched ( e.g. , corbel et al .",
    "2001 ; maccarone , gallo & fender 2003 ) . in this general picture riqs could well be relativistically beamed counterparts of the rqq jets . in alternative schemes ,",
    "the radio weakness of rqqs is attributed to a rapid deceleration of the jet on subparsec scale , caused perhaps by : strong interaction with the torus material ( e.g. , falcke , malkan & biermann 1995a ; falcke , gopal - krishna & biermann 1995b ) ; mass loading with the debris of stars tidally disrupted by the smbh ( gopal - krishna , mangalam & wiita 2008 ) ; ejection velocities less than the escape velocity ( ghisellini , haardt & matt 2004 ) ; or a high photon density environment produced by the quasar ( barvainis et al .",
    "2005 ) .    if indeed , riqs are relativistically boosted counterparts of rqqs , observing the former provides an opportunity to better detect rqq jets and compare their properties with the better studied , more powerful radio jets of rlqs .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to enquire if the postulated relativistic beaming of rqq jets manifests itself as blazar - like behaviour in riqs .",
    "indeed , this seems to be the case for the most prominent example of the riq class , namely iii zw 2 ( see below ) .",
    "however , essentially no such information is currently available for riqs as a class even though they , despite being numerically rare , are a potentially very important link between the major agn classes powered by nuclear activity , namely rqqs , rlqs and blazars .",
    "the present study is a first attempt to bridge this gap in a statistically significant manner .    in terms of radio properties ,",
    "riqs form a distinct subclass . their dominant feature is a radio core ( compact on arcsecond scale ) of a flat , variable radio spectrum ( falcke , patnaik & sherwood 1996a ; kukula et al .",
    "1998 ; also , kellermann et al . 1994 ; ulvestad et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the aforementioned view that they are relativistically boosted rqq jets has found strong support from the discoveries of long - term , large amplitude ( * up to a factor of 20 * ) radio variability of the riq iii zw 2 ( b0007@xmath16106 ; tersranta et al .",
    "1998 ) and of superluminal motion in its radio core ( brunthaler et al .  2000 , 2005 ) , both being canonical attributes of blazars .",
    "unfortunately , equivalent observational data are severely lacking for other known riqs .",
    "it may further be emphasized that iii zw 2 ( @xmath17 ) has in fact been classified as seyfert 1 ( arp 1968 ; osterbrock 1977 ) hosted by a spiral galaxy ( hutchings & campbell 1983 ; taylor et al .",
    "thus , an interesting question is which , if any , blazar - like characteristics are associated with riqs of high optical luminosity ( @xmath18 ) , which are bona - fide qsos and hence more likely to be associated with massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "promising indications come from the recent finding that for the radio spectra of the riqs found in the sdss are typically flat or inverted ( consistent with the postulated relativistic beaming of their jets ) and , moreover , radio flux variability ( near 1 ghz ) on year - like time scales is actually comparably common for riqs and rlqs ( wang et al .",
    "for both these reasons , riqs appear to be promising candidates for inov , albeit it is unclear if the mechanism responsible for long - term variations is also responsible for inov .    in recent years",
    ", inov has been increasingly recognized as a signature of blazar - like jets .",
    "extensive observations have shown that inov with large amplitude ( with variations , @xmath19 , exceeding 3% ) occurs almost exclusively in blazars and , furthermore , the duty cycle ( dc ) of inov in blazars is very high ( @xmath20 ) , provided the monitoring duration exceeds about 4 hours ( e.g. , carini 1990 ; gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ; stalin et al . 2004a , 2005 ) .",
    "to exploit this clue we have carried out an inov survey of a fairly large and representative sample of 8 riqs , further augmented by the inov data available in the literature for another 2 riqs that meet the selection criteria adopted for our sample of 8 riqs .",
    "thus , the enlarged sample consists of 10 optically bright and intrinsically luminous , core - dominated riqs .",
    "* cosnsiderable evidence exisits for relativistic beaming in these riqs .",
    "falcke , mathew & biermann ( 1995a ) find j1336 + 1725 to be radio variable , but not j1701 + 5149 . for j1259 + 3423 multi - epoch flux measurements are not known to us , hence its variablity status is unknown at present .",
    "the remaining 7 riqs in our sample are all found to be radio variable ( wang et al .",
    "2006 , falcke , sharwood & patnaik 1996 ) .",
    "thus , at least 8 of the 10 riqs are known to shown radio variability .",
    "furthermore , spectral information is available in the literature for 8 out of the 10 riqs and each case the radio spectrum is found to be either flat or inverted ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all this suggests that the radio jets in essentially all there riqs are at least modestly doppler boosted . * .",
    "since detection of any blazar - like jet characteristics in riqs is our main objective here , we have focused on the riqs for which credible evidence for relativistically boosted jet emission exists ( at least in the radio band ) .",
    "this leads us to largely excluding the steep - spectrum riqs , which also exist ( e.g. , martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "thus , our sample contains only riqs having flat or inverted radio spectra ( at least a flat - spectrum radio core ) , in addition to satisfying the usual criterion , namely , _",
    "k_-corrected ratio @xmath21 of 5 ghz to 2500   fluxes , falling in the range 3 @xmath22 _",
    "r_@xmath23 @xmath22100 ( section 1 ; miller , rawlings & saunders 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , in order to attain an inov detection threshold of @xmath012% using a 12 metre class telescope equipped with a ccd detector , we have confined ourselves to optically bright riqs ( @xmath24 @xmath22 18.0 mag ) .",
    "finally , in order to minimize contamination from the host galaxy ( cellone , romero & combi 2000 ) , our sample was restricted to intrinsically luminous agns with @xmath25 @xmath22 @xmath2623.5 mag ( see also stalin et al .",
    "2004a ) . based on these well defined basic criteria ,",
    "our sample ( table 1 ) was assembled in the following manner :    \\(a ) seven riqs with adequate brightnesses and good nearby comparison stars originally were selected from the list of 89 riqs prepared by wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on the detection of radio flux variability among sdss quasars ; they are thus presumed to have a flat / inverted radio spectrum . out of these ,",
    "three riqs ( j140730.43@xmath16545601.6 , j162548.79@xmath16264658.7 and j210757.67@xmath26062010.6 ) could not be monitored due to observing time constraints , leaving the remaining 4 riqs in our sample .",
    "\\(b ) four riqs were chosen from table 1 of falcke , sherwood & patnaik ( 1996b ) on the criterion of having a flat / inverted radio spectrum , based on their quasi - simultaneous measurements at 2.7 and 10 ghz ( @xmath27 @xmath280.5 ; @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 ) .",
    "\\(c ) one riq ( j1259 + 3423 ) was contributed by the sample observed by carini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "\\(d ) one riq ( j1701@xmath165149 ) was included in our sample , despite its being reported a as steep - spectrum type ( falcke , sherwood & patnaik 1996b ) , because it was later resolved and found to possess a core with a flat spectrum , with @xmath32 @xmath33 ( kukula et al .",
    "1998 ; see also , hutchings , neff & gower 1992 ) .",
    "lastly , we note that the riq j0832@xmath163707 is included in the our sample inspite of its being nearly 1-mag fainter than the adopted threshold ( @xmath25 @xmath22 @xmath2623.5 mag ) , since it is found to be stellar in the fbqs survey ( white et al .  2000 ) .",
    "however , its exclusion from the sample would have no significant impact on our conclusions .",

    "the field positioning was adjusted so as to also have within the ccd frame 2 - 3 comparison stars within about a magnitude of the rqq , in order to minimize the possibility of getting spurious variability detection ( e.g. , cellone , romero & araudo 2007 ) .",

    "jang & miller ( 1995 ) monitored this riq on two nights during 1994 , for durations of 3.3 and 3.8 hours .",
    "they report confirmed inov on the former night ( table 2 ) .",
    "even though their monitoring durations fall marginally short of our criterion , we have included their data in the present study ( table 2 ) .",
    "+ for the two riqs not covered in our monitoring programme , the summary of inov and ltov results , taken from the literature , is as follows : + * riq j1312 + 3515 : * this riq was monitored by carini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for three nights but no inov was detected ( table 2 ) .",
    "they do not comment on any longer - term fluctuations over the four - days time span covered by their observations .",
    "although inov remained undetected also in the three nights monitoring of this riq by sagar et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( table 2 ) , a 0.10 mag fading was found between the first two epochs of their monitoring programme , separated by two years .",
    "* riq j1701 + 5149 : * this riq was monitored on four nights by carini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , but no inov was seen ( table 2 ) . also , significant fluctuations were found to be absent both on inter - night or longer timescales .",
    "this riq was also monitored by jang ( 2005 ) who detected a confirmed inov ( @xmath85 , table 2 ) .",
    "the results reported here for a well defined , representative sample of * flat / inverted spectrum * riqs provide a large increase over the existing information , both in terms of sample size and observing time .",
    "thus , they permit the first good estimate of the inov characteristics of riqs and allow their comparison with those of the major agn classes that are widely separated in the degree of radio loudness .",
    "the inov mechanism for the major agn classes continues to be debated ( section 1 ) .",
    "for the ( jet - dominated ) blazars , inov is believed to be associated with irregularities in the non - thermal doppler boosted jet flow , impacted by shocks ( e.g. , blandford & knigl 1979 ; miller , carini & goodrich 1989 ; marscher 1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , the instabilities or perturbations within the accretion disc might contribute very significantly to the inov in the case of rqqs ( e.g. , wiita et al .",
    "1991 ; mangalam & wiita 1993 ) , particularly since any contribution from the jet must be weak .    to put the question of inov of riqs in perspective",
    "one may recall the known inov characteristics of blazars ( e.g. , heidt & wagner 1996 ; dai et al .",
    "2001 ; romero et al . 2002 ; xie et al . 2002 ; sagar et al . 2004 ; stalin et al . 2005 ) and rqqs ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al . 1993 , 2003 ; jang & miller 1995 , 1997 ; stalin et al . 2005 ; carini et al .",
    "the major findings of these studies are that blazars tend to vary more frequently and more strongly ( @xmath86 ) on intranight timescales , in stark contrast to rqqs and even to non - blazar rlqs , which show only mild inov ( i.e. , @xmath87 ; stalin et al .",
    "moreover , for monitoring durations in excess of @xmath1 hours , the inov duty cycle is @xmath88 for bl lacs ( carini 1990 ; miller & noble 1996 ; romero et al .",
    "2002 ; gopal - krishna et al . 2003 ; stalin et al .",
    "2005 ) , mostly with large inov amplitudes ( @xmath86 ; gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ) but the duty cycle is only @xmath89 for rqqs ( jang & miller 1995 , 1997 ; de diego et al . 1998 ; romero et al . 1999 ; gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ; stalin et al .",
    "2004b ) , or even core dominated rlqs ( stalin et al . 2004b",
    "; ramrez et al . 2009 ) .",
    "thus , the key result from the present study is that the inov duty cycle for riqs is small ( @xmath0 10% ) , and clearly not greater than that known for rqqs and non - blazar type rlqs .",
    "although exact values of computed dcs will depend upon the sample and analysis technique , the key difference in inov frequency is between blazars and both radio loud and radio quiet non - blazar classes ( stalin et al . 2004b , 2005 ) as also confirmed recently by ramrez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . moreover , on no occasion ( among the 42 nights ) do we have the evidence for an inov amplitude exceeding @xmath90 level , even though each of the 10 riqs was monitored for at least @xmath0 4 hours in every session ( sect .  1 ; table 2 ) .",
    "specifically , the monitoring durations in our programme ranged between 3.9 hours to 7.6 hours , with an average of 5.2 hours .",
    "as emphasized by carini ( 1990 ) , the duration of monitoring in a given session can play a substantial role in determining the inov status of an agn , such that the probability of confirmed inov detection in bl lacs is found to increase from @xmath91 to @xmath92 if the duration of monitoring is raised from @xmath0 3 hours to @xmath0 8 hours .",
    "a similar dependence on monitoring duration has been noticed for rqqs , where the chances of inov detection increases to @xmath93 if the monitoring is done for @xmath06 - 7 hours ( de diego et al .",
    "1998 ; carini et al .",
    "it is conceivable that the inov duty cycle of @xmath94 estimated here for riqs may go up marginally when longer monitoring sessions become possible , but this is unlikely to alter our main conclusions .",
    "the simplest explanation for the difference in variability is to assume that all quasars do possess nuclear radio jets , with the differences in both observed inov dcs and amplitudes explained by different doppler boosting arising from both different viewing angles and different shock velocities ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "another possible explanation for the low inov dc would involve dilution of jet s optical emission by the expected accretion disc emission ; however , this is unlikely to be important here , since all the riqs in our sample lie at small redshifts ( @xmath95 ; table 1 ) whereas the bulk of the continuum emission of the disk would be expected to arise in the far - uv and would only move in the r - band for @xmath96 ( e.g. , bachev et al .",
    "2005 ; carini et al .",
    "2007 ) . furthermore , since all but one of these riqs have @xmath97 , the chance of the host galaxies stellar continua diluting the inov when compared to the other classes of qsos is also very small .    were the inov properties of agns to depend primarily on the beamed radio emission , one would expect stronger and more frequent inov for our sample of riqs , as compared to that found for rqqs",
    ". such an expectation would be in tune with the widely held notion that riqs are doppler boosted counterparts of rqqs , as inferred from their high brightness temperature ( @xmath98 ) , prominent radio cores and low extended fluxes at radio wavelengths , measured using milli - arcsecond resolution radio images available for a few riqs ( section 1 ) .",
    "the inov data reported here do not accord well these broad expectations , since we have found the inov of riqs to be as mild as that known for rqqs .",
    "thus , the riq pg0007 + 106 ( iii zw 2 ) remains the only well established case for which a blazar - like , large and rapid flux variability has been detected ( both at radio and optical wavelengths , sect .  1 ) .",
    "in particular , the source was found by jang @xmath99 miller ( 1997 ) to vary by up to 0.1 mag on each the two nights they monitored it for 4-hour duration .",
    "interestingly , the observed high level of activity would not have been anticipated , given that this object was found to show a very low optical polarization : @xmath100 , ( berriman et al .",
    "the riq iii zw 2 underwent a slow fading by @xmath00.8 mag between 1978 to 1981 , after which it displayed rapid flares of increasing amplitude , brightening by 0.92 magnitude in 27 days during november 1985 and then fading by 0.95 mag in the following week ( pica et al .",
    "1988 ) . such large variability , along with the observed inov ( see above ) is clearly characteristic of ovv type blazars . in the longer term",
    ", its optical light curve has shown a four - fold variation in 25 years ( salvi et al .",
    "2002 ) and , likewise , a 20-fold brightening within 4 years has been recorded at radio wavelengths ( aller et al . 1985 ) .",
    "all these variability properties firmly place this object in the blazar category ( kukula et al .",
    "1998 ; aller et al . 1999 ; tersranta et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , none of the 10 riqs in our representative sample qualify for the blazar classification , on the basis of the currently available data summarized above .",
    "the present observations are also useful for measuring any long - term optical variability ( ltov ) occurring on month - like or longer timescales . for the vast majority of riqs , which are represented by the present sample and which are hosted by luminous ( very likely elliptical ) galaxies , we find the optical variability to be very common on month / year - like time scales , with typical amplitude approaching 0.1-mag level in r - band .",
    "this riq specific result is in accord with the findings reported by webb & malkan ( 2000 ) for more common agn types . for roughly half",
    "the agns they found optical variability amplitudes of 0.1  0.2 mag ( rms ) on month - like time scale .",
    "a similar pattern is reported by barvainis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , based on their 10-epoch vla radio variability survey of a large sample consisting of rqqs , riqs and rlqs .",
    "they found no statistical difference between the degrees of radio variability displayed by these three major subclasses of quasars .",
    "thus , both intranight and long - term optical variability properties , together with the other afore - cited evidence from the literature , demonstrate that as a class riqs display much lower activity levels than do blazars , which would be rather surprising if they are a strongly relativistically beamed subset of rqqs , a possibility widely discussed in the literature .",
    "the possibility that these riq sources possess intrinsically moderate radio jets and are not strongly doppler boosted ( in either radio or optical band ) therefore must be considered . in that case",
    "either roughly comparable amounts of jet fluctuations , or even disc dominated variability , could explain the similar inov and ltov properties of riqs and rqqs .",
    "the low optical polarizations seen for riqs in our sample ( table 1 ) also seem consistent with a lack of strong relativistic beaming , though the case of iii zw 2 discussed above calls for caution in reaching this inference .",
    "a key observational difference between these riqs and the rqqs is the predominance of flat or inverted radio spectra for the former group , which is generally not the case for rqqs ( e.g. , kukula et al . 1998 ) and which was argued to imply ( at least somewhat ) boosted jets in the riqs .    one conceivable explanation then for the relative lack of inov in riqs would be that , because of bending of their jets on the innermost scales , their optically emitting inner portions are misdirected and hence concealed from us ( despite the beaming ) and only the more extended radio emitting outer parts of the jets happen to be pointed towards us . verifying this alternative would require sensitive vlbi observations .",
    "however , an implication of this scenario is that one would expect to find some cases of blazar - like optical variability in radio - quiet agn whose radio emitting ( but not optical emitting ) sections of the jet are misaligned from us .",
    "the few searches made so far for radio - quiet bl lacs have either been negative ( e.g. , stocke et al .",
    "1990 ; londish et al . 2007 ) or have produced a only a small fraction of candidate bl lacs that have low , but not extremely low , upper limits to their radio fluxes ( collinge et al .",
    "finally , it may be noted that despite the vast increase in the intranight monitoring data , as reported here , the total number of nights used for their monitoring is still modest ( 42 nights ) when compared with those devoted to blazars and even rqqs . since a few convincing cases of riqs showing modest intranight or internight variability",
    "have nonetheless been found , it would be worthwhile to continue such observations in the search for examples of blazar - like strong inov activity among riqs , similar to that detected so far only for the nearest known riq , iii zw 2 .",

    "<S> r-_band on 25 nights during 2005 - 09 . on each night </S>",
    "<S> only one riq was monitored for a minimum duration of @xmath0 4 hours ( the average being 5.2 hours per night ) . </S>",
    "<S> using the ccd as an n - star photometer , an intranight optical variability ( inov ) detection threshold of @xmath0 12% was achieved for the densely sampled differential light curves ( dlcs ) derived from our data . </S>",
    "<S> these observations amount to a large increase over those reported hitherto for this rare and sparsely studied class of quasars which can , however , play an important role in understanding the link between the dominant varieties of powerful agn , namely the radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and blazars . despite the probable presence of relativistically boosted nuclear jets , inferred from their flat / inverted radio spectra , clear evidence for inov in our extensive observations was detected only on one night . </S>",
    "<S> also , flux variation between two consecutive nights was clearly seen for one of the riqs . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that as a class , riqs are much less extreme in nuclear activity compared to blazars . </S>",
    "<S> the availability in the literature of inov data for another 2 riqs conforming to our selection criteria allowed us to enlarge the sample to 10 riqs ( monitored on a total of 42 nights for a minimum duration of @xmath1 hours per night ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of large amplitude inov @xmath2 persists in this enlarged sample . </S>",
    "<S> this extensive database has enabled us to arrive at the first estimate for the inov duty cycle ( dc ) of riqs . </S>",
    "<S> the dc is found to be small ( @xmath0 9% ) , increasing to @xmath0 14% if the two cases of ` probable ' inov are included . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding value is known to be @xmath3 for bl lacs and @xmath4 for both rlqs and rqqs , if they too are monitored for @xmath5 hours in each session . </S>",
    "<S> our observations also provide information about the long - term optical variability ( ltov ) of riqs , which is found to be fairly common and reaches typical amplitudes of @xmath6 0.1-mag . </S>",
    "<S> the light curves of these riqs are briefly discussed in the context of a theoretical framework proposed earlier for linking this rare kind of quasars to the much better studied dominant classes of quasars .    </S>",
