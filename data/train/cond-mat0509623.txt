    "the proximity effect between a ferromagnet and a superconductor has attracted much attention recently due to its potential applications in such areas of technology as magnetoelectronics @xcite or quantum computing @xcite . the proximity effect in ferromagnet - superconductor (",
    "f - s ) structures is also important from the point of view of the scientific interest as it allows the study of the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "due to time reversal symmetry breaking the proximity effect in f - s structures leads to new phenomena , not observed in usual normal metal - superconductor ( n - s ) proximity systems .",
    "those are : oscillations of the superconducting transition temperature @xcite , density of states @xcite and superconducting pairing amplitude in f - s multilayers , josephson @xmath0-junction behavior in s - f - s heterostructures @xcite , a giant mutual proximity effect in s - f systems @xcite , spin valve @xcite or spontaneous currents in f - s bilayers @xcite . for review of the literature on those and related effects see @xcite .",
    "we have recently examined f - s proximity system and found that a spontaneously generated current flows on both sides of the interface @xcite .",
    "such a current , which flows in the ground state of the system is a hallmark of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) like state , originally predicted for a bulk superconductor in a magnetic exchange field acting on spins only @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to see what the effect on the fflo state will have a normal metal sandwiched between ferromagnet and superconductor ( f - n - s structure ) .",
    "will the spontaneous current still be generated ?",
    "if so , how will it be modified ? in the rest of the paper",
    "we show that the presence of the normal metal has nontrivial consequences on the generation of the spontaneous currents and on the fflo state in general .",
    "our model system is schematically shown in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of a ferromagnet ( layers @xmath1 ) , a normal ( paramagnetic ) region ( layers @xmath2 ) and a semi - infinite superconductor ( layers @xmath3 ) .",
    "the model hamiltonian is given by single orbital hubbard model @xmath4 c^+_{i\\sigma } c_{j\\sigma } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i\\sigma } u_i \\hat n_{i\\sigma } \\hat n_{i -\\sigma } , \\label{hamilt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in the presence of a vector potential , the nearest neighbor hopping integral is @xmath5 .",
    "the site energy levels @xmath6 are equal to @xmath7 in the ferromagnet and @xmath8 in the normal and superconducting region , and @xmath9 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath10 is the on - site electron - electron interaction , which is assumed to be negative on superconducting side and zero elsewhere , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the usual electron creation ( annihilation ) operators and @xmath13 is the electron number operator .",
    "we study the above model in the spin - polarized hartree - fock - gorkov ( sphfg ) approximation , assuming the landau gauge for the magnetic field @xmath14 , thus @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the following we assume periodicity of our model in the direction parallel to the interface and",
    "therefore we work in @xmath16 space in the @xmath17 direction but in real space in the @xmath18 direction .    as usual , self - consistency",
    "is assured by the relations determining sc order parameter @xmath19 , current @xmath20 and the vector potential @xmath21 on each layer @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 nambu green function and @xmath28 the fermi distribution",
    ". equation ( [ vec_pot ] ) is a lattice version of the ampere s law @xmath29 .",
    "the above equations have to be solved self - consistently , using the method described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the spatial dependence of the normalized superconducting pairing amplitude @xmath30 ( left panel ) and spontaneous current @xmath31 ( right panel ) for a number of normal metal @xmath32 layers ( @xmath33 ) .    as in our previous work on f - s structures @xcite",
    ", the superconducting pairing amplitude shows clear oscillations in the ferromagnet .",
    "the period of the oscillations is related to the ferromagnetic coherence length @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 . no such effect is observed in the n region .",
    "one could expect that the inclusion of the normal metal suppresses the oscillations of @xmath36 in the f region .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the @xmath36 oscillations on the ferromagnetic side remains almost unchanged .",
    "only the phase of the oscillations can change . moreover , as for f - s bilayer @xcite , the vanishing of the pairing amplitude at @xmath37 is related to the crossing of the andreev bound states ( abs ) through the fermi energy of the system .",
    "furthermore , in such a situation , spontaneous current is generated @xcite .",
    "the current flowing produces a magnetic field , which splits this zero energy abs , thus lowering the total energy of the system .",
    "the energy of this splitting is given in our model by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the layer averaged vector potential .",
    "as we already mentioned , the zero energy abs is responsible for the generation of the spontaneous current .",
    "the typical distribution of such current , flowing parallel to the interface , is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the current flows in the negative @xmath17 direction on the superconducting side and in the positive direction in the whole @xmath40 region , giving a total current equal to zero , as should be in the true ground state .",
    "interestingly , the current in the ferromagnet shows also oscillatory behavior , however , with a different period than the pairing amplitude does .",
    "the oscillations of the current are related to the oscillations of the density of states at the fermi energy @xcite . on the other hand , in the n region ,",
    "the distribution of the current is rather smooth , similarly to the pairing amplitude ( compare the solid and thin dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the state with spontaneous current is a true ground state , as it has lower energy than the state with no current .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which shows the change in total energy of the system @xmath41 between the solution with spontaneous current and the one where the current is constrained to be zero is shown .",
    "another important finding is that the system can be periodically switched between the states with and without spontaneous current by increasing of the thickness of the normal metal region . for @xmath42 layers and",
    "@xmath43 the period is equal to six ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "all above the results show that inclusion of the normal metal slab between the ferromagnet and superconductor has non - trivial effects on the physics of the proximity induced fflo state .",
    "it can not be argued that the normal metal simply acts as interface transparency , as in our case the n slab is in the clean ( ballistic ) regime , and thus does not suppress the proximity effect .",
    "however , it leads to the suppression of the oscillatory behavior of the pairing amplitude , spontaneous current and the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "moreover , it strongly modifies the positions of the abs , which leads to the periodical switching between the states with and without current .",
    "interface transparency also leads to such periodical switching of the current @xcite , however , at the same time it also kills the proximity effect , suppressing the current and changing the period of the pairing amplitude oscillations .",
    "no such effects are caused by the inclusion of the normal metal slab .",
    "perhaps the effect of the n slab would be more similar to the effect of reduced interface transparency if the normal metal was in the dirty regime .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the ground state properties of f - n - s proximity system . we have observed oscillatory behavior of the superconducting pairing amplitude in ferromagnet , but not in the normal region .",
    "similarly to f - s structures , we have found spontaneously generated currents flowing in the whole f and n regions and within a distance of a few @xmath44 on superconducting side .",
    "interestingly , the system can be switched periodically ( changing @xmath32 ) between the states with and without the spontaneous current .",
    "all this suggests possible realization of the proximity induced fflo state in f - n - s heterostructure .",
