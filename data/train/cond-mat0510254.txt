    "the random fluctuations of the conductance from sample to sample of non - interacting systems are universal .",
    "the universality  @xcite means that the conductance statistics can be described by universal functions , which are independent from the shape of the dot or the details of the disordered potential . particularly , the variance of the conductance @xmath0 is of the order @xmath1 and is nearly independent from the sample geometry ( @xmath2 is the quantum of conductance for spin degenerate electrons ) .",
    "the other universal quantity is the weak localization correction to the conductance , defined as the difference of average values of the conductance over orthogonal ( zero magnetic field ) and unitary ( strong magnetic field ) ensembles .",
    "the weak localization correction to the conductance is also of the order of @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "one approach is based on a diagram technique developed for disordered bulk metals  @xcite , when the scattering amplitudes are represented in terms of electron green functions  @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches are based on the description of the system by random matrices , when either an exact scattering matrix is replaced by a random unitary matrix , or an exact hamiltonian is replaced by a random hermitian matrix . in the first case , the unitary matrix is taken from dyson s circular ensemble of uniformly distributed random matrices  @xcite . in the hamiltonian approach , the hermitian matrix belongs to an ensemble of random matrices  @xcite with the gaussian distribution of its matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence for statistical description of electron transport by both random matrix approaches was shown in  @xcite .",
    "although the random matrix approach is not based on microscopic description of electron system , their correspondence to microscopic problem has been proven for disordered metal grains  @xcite .",

    "changing magnetic field or shape of the dot one can obtain different realizations of the quantum dot and experimentally study statistics of the quantum corrections to the conductance .",

    "the suppression of the quantum corrections to the conductance by microwave radiation was observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "time - dependent perturbation of quantum dots not only suppresses quantum corrections to the conductance , but also produces electric current through the system even at zero bias .",

    "it turns out  @xcite that the photovoltaic current is sensitive to the actual electron distribution function in the dot .",
    "time - dependent perturbations may broaden the distribution function , resulting in heating .",
    "this broadening of the electron distribution occurs as a result the electron diffusion in the energy space .",
    "the effect of time - dependent perturbations on electron distribution function becomes even more interesting in closed systems , when the energy diffusion acquires quantum interference corrections .",
