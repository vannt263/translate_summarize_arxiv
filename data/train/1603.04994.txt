    "the formation of massive stars remains an unsolved problem in astrophysics .",
    "this is especially challenging since very massive stars ( vms , @xmath7 ) are usually located within young massive star clusters ( @xmath8 ) with small core radii ( @xmath9 0.10.2 pc , portegies zwart et al .",
    "2010 ) . the short lifetime of such stars ( 23 myr , yusof et al .",
    "2013 ) restricts suitable milky way star clusters to only a handful , including the arches ( martins et al .",
    "2008 ) and ngc  3603 ( schnurr et al . 2008 ) , both of which are highly reddened .",
    "therefore , observations of young star clusters at ultraviolet wavelengths  corresponding to the peak output of hot , luminous stars  are largely restricted to extragalactic cases .",
    "r136 was included in the census of optically bright magellanic cloud stars by feast et al .",
    "( 1960 ) , and subsequently resolved into three components , a , b and c ( feitzinger et al .",
    "1980 ) , with component a subsequently shown to be multiple ( weigelt & baier 1985 ) .",
    "r136a is the closest example of an extragalactic young massive star cluster ( hunter et al . 1995 ) .",
    "it is the central cluster of the ngc  2070 complex within the 30 doradus star forming region in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , massey & hunter 1998 ; doran et al .",
    "2013 ) , and is relatively lightly reddened , facilitating study at ultraviolet wavelengths ( de marchi et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , the 0.1pc core radius of r136a ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2010 ; selman & melnick 2013 ) subtends only 0.41@xmath10 at the 50kpc distance to the lmc ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2013 ) , which led to the cluster at one time being mistaken for a @xmath111000 @xmath6 star ( cassinelli et al .",
    "1981 , feitzinger et al .",
    "1983 ) , although walborn ( 1973 ) had earlier predicted that r136a would have a structure analogous to the core of ngc  3603 .",
    "consequently , observations at high spatial resolution are required to resolve individual stars within the core of r136a , requiring either hubble space telescope or large ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics ( vlt / mad : campbell et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the star - formation history of ngc  2070 has recently been investigated by cignoni et al .",
    "( 2015 ) using hubble tarantula treasury project ( http ) imaging , revealing an upturn in star formation @xmath127 myr ago , peaking 23 myr ago , and a total stellar mass of 9@xmath13 assembled within 20 pc of r136 .",
    "the mass function for intermediate- and low - mass stars in r136 have been obtained from hst imaging ( hunter et al .",
    "1995 ; de marchi et al . 2011 ) .",
    "however , the colour / reddening degeneracy of hot massive stars at ultraviolet and optical wavelenths necessitates spectroscopy for robust physical properties , and in turn , masses , measuring present - day mass functions ( though see maz apellniz et al .",
    "2014 ) . to date ,",
    "koornneef & mathis ( 1981 ) and vacca et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have presented uv scans across ngc  2070 with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) , while uv spectroscopy of individual stars of r136a has been limited to the brightest members with hst / ghrs ( de koter et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "meanwhile , massey & hunter ( 1998 ) have obtained optical spectroscopy for dozens of stars within ngc  2070 using hst / fos , which revealed large numbers of very early o stars , indicating a young cluster age ( @xmath1412 myr ) .",
    "more recently schnurr et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used vlt / sinfoni to obtain spatially resolved k - band spectroscopy of the brightest sources , namely r136a1 , a2 , a3 and c , which are wn - type emission - line stars .",
    "analysis of the vlt and hst spectroscopy plus vlt / mad imaging led crowther et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to conclude that such stars possess very high ( initial ) stellar masses of 160320 @xmath6 , results largely supported by bestenlehner et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and hainich et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .      the existence of such high - mass stars in r136 challenges the previously accepted @xmath15 upper stellar mass limit ( figer 2005 ) , unless they are products of stellar mergers ( banerjee et al .",
    "2012 ; schneider et al .",
    "if such stars are indeed merger remnants one would expect younger apparent ages for this with respect to lower mass stars , and differences in the present day mass function with respect to a salpeter slope ( schneider et al . 2014a ; schneider et al .",
    "massey & hunter ( 1998 ) suggested that the mass function of r136 is normal , although their study only included a subset of the brightest stars in the vicinity of r136a ."
