    "over the last three decades the orbital physics of @xmath6 systems and its interplay with spin has focused primarily on transition metal oxides , especially 3@xmath7 transition metals ( tms ) .",
    "while the magnetic @xmath6 configuration has been studied mostly in @xmath8 systems , it can also occur in mid- to late-5@xmath7 tm ionic systems .",
    "for these heavy ions spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) becomes a competing factor , mixing the various spin , orbital , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the interplay of strong electron correlation and large soc is relatively less explored , and certainly not well understood at all , because the behavior involves so many comparable energy scales .",
    "this situation arises in a broad family of magnetic mott insulating systems in which three - fold degenerate @xmath9 orbitals are partially filled.@xcite in such systems orbital degeneracy is protected only by cubic lattice symmetry , and typically the crystal field splitting is large enough that @xmath10 orbitals are out of the picture .    in @xmath11 @xmath9",
    "subshells where soc remains unquenched ( cubic symmetry ) , the six one - electron levels split into an upper @xmath12=1/2 doublet and a lower @xmath12=3/2 quartet . in this category",
    "ir - based based magnets have been studied actively.@xcite a prominent class of such systems is the ordered double perovskites , with chemical formula a@xmath0bb@xmath13o@xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in the case where b is a closed shell cation and b@xmath13 is a magnetic ion ; in such cases unusually high formal valence states can arise .",
    "a few examples attracting recent interest are b@xmath13=ru@xmath14 and os@xmath14 in a@xmath0nab@xmath13o@xmath1 ( a = la and nd),@xcite mo@xmath14 in ba@xmath0ymoo@xmath1 , os@xmath15 in ba@xmath0caoso@xmath16@xcite and heptavalent os in ba@xmath0boso@xmath1 ( b = li , na ) .",
    "if we narrow our focus to @xmath6 b@xmath13 ions only , the possibilities are practically confined to mo@xmath14 , re@xmath15 and os@xmath17 ) .",
    "et al . _ have reported a theoretical study@xcite of koso@xmath18 with heptavalent os , where large soc , strong correlations , and structural symmetry breaking conspire to produce an unexpectedly large orbital moment in the @xmath19 shell that nominally supports no orbital moment .",
    "the recently studied compounds@xcite ba@xmath0boso@xmath1 ( b = li , na ) show many features to make them of current interest .",
    "besides the double - perovskite structure , and being a rare example of a heptavalent osmium compound , ba@xmath4naoso@xmath5 ( bnoo ) is exotic in being a _ ferromagnetic mott insulator_,@xcite with order appearing at t@xmath20 = 6.8k with curie - weiss temperature @xmath21 -10k . although its single @xmath9 electron orders magnetically , it shows no evidence of the anticipated orbital order that causes jahn - teller distortion and should destroys its cubic symmetry .",
    "the sister compound la@xmath0naoso@xmath1 , on the other hand , with high - spin @xmath22 os configuration and a nominally cubic symmetry , is observed to be highly distorted.@xcite this distortion is ascribed to geometrical misfit arising from incompatible ionic radii .",
    "there is a recent example of an os - based based @xmath23 perovskite compound baoso@xmath24 that remains cubic;@xcite on the other hand a related perovskite @xmath25 naoso@xmath24 does distort.@xcite the question of origin of the magnetic ordering in bnoo is surely a delicate one , since isostructural , isovalent , and also mott insulating ba@xmath0lioso@xmath1 ( bloo ) orders _ antiferromagnetically _ in spite of a very similar curie - weiss susceptibility@xcite and similar volume .",
    "lee and pickett demonstrated@xcite that , before considering magnetism and on - site interaction effects , soc splits the @xmath9 bands into a lower @xmath12=@xmath26 quartet and an upper @xmath12=@xmath27 doublet , as expected .",
    "since bnoo is observed to be insulating and effects of spin - orbit coupling drive the behavior , it provides the first `` j@xmath28=@xmath26 '' mott insulator at quarter - filling , analogous to the `` j@xmath28=@xmath27 '' mott insulators at half - filling that are being studied in @xmath25 systems.@xcite    including spin polarization and on - site hubbard u repulsion beyond the semilocal density approximation ( dft+u+soc ) with both the wien2k and fplo codes gave essentially full spin polarization but was not able to open a gap@xcite with a reasonable value of u. the complication is that the occupied orbital is a oso@xmath5 cluster orbital with half of the charge on os and the other half spread over the neighboring o ions .",
    "u should be a value appropriate to this cluster orbital and should be applied to that orbital , however the codes applied u only to the os @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "xiang and whangbo@xcite neglected the hund s rule @xmath29 in the dft+u method , and did obtain a gap .",
    "however , neglecting @xmath29 omits both the hund s rule exchange energy and the anisotropy ( orbital dependence ) of the hubbard interaction @xmath30 , whereas one of our intentions is to include all orbital dependencies to understand the anisotropy on the os site .    in this paper",
    "we first establish how to model this system faithfully including all anisotropy , then address the interplay of soc coupling with correlation effects and crystal field splitting . the density functional extension to include some fraction of hartree - fock exchange  the hybrid functional  open the gap , but only when soc is included .",
    "the inclusion of nonlocal exchange and soc provides an understanding of the mott insulating ground state and a [ 110 ] easy axis , both in agreement with experimental data.@xcite we conclude that bnoo provides an example of a @xmath31 , quarter - filled mott insulator .",
    "some comparison is made to isovalent bloo , which had 6% smaller volume and aligns antiferromagnetically rather than ferromagnetically .",
    "two density functional theory based studies , mentioned briefly above , have been reported for bnoo .",
    "one was performed within a fully anisotropic implementation of the dft+u method@xcite while the other was dft+u@xcite ( gga+u ) , but neglecting anisotropy of the interaction .",
    "an overriding feature of this system is a strong hybridization of os 5@xmath32 orbitals with o 2@xmath33 states , with the result that the `` @xmath9 '' bands have half of their density on the four neighboring oxygen ions in the plane of the orbital . in keeping with this strong hybridization ,",
    "the `` o @xmath34 '' bands have considerable os @xmath11 charge , such that the @xmath11 occupation of the nominally @xmath2 ion is actually 4 - 5 electrons , still leaving a highly charged ion but less than half of the formal 7 + designation .",
    "lee and pickett reported@xcite that fully anisotropic dft+u could not reproduce a mott insulating state because u is applied on the os ion whereas half of the occupied local orbital ( cluster orbital ) density lies on neighboring oxygen ions . a model treatment",
    "in which u is applied to the cluster orbital did produce the mott insulating state.@xcite whangbo s results indicate that part of the complication in this system involves the anisotropy of the repulsion within the os ion .    the study reported by whangbo _ et .",
    "al._@xcite addressed three spin directions ( [ 001 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] ) . within their treatment ,",
    "the [ 111 ] spin direction led to the minimum energy , indicated a calculated band gap of 0.3 ev for u=0.21 ry = 2.85 ev ( j@xmath35=0 ) . using dft+u+soc and the same code but including anisotropy of the interaction @xmath30",
    ", we have not reproduced this gap , indicating their gap is due to the neglect of hund s rule coupling and anisotropy of the interaction . because of the need to include all interactions and all anisotropy , we have adopted a different approach based on the hybrid exchange - correlation functional , described in the next section .",
    "this approach seems to be more robust , allowing us to probe the interplay of soc and strong correlation of bnoo , and also obtain results of the effect of pressure on the ground state of bnoo .",
    "our first challenge was to obtain a mott insulating state in bnoo when all interactions ( correlation and soc ) are accounted for . with large soc",
    "the result depends on the assigned direction of the moment .",
    "the hybrid functional approach plus soc leads directly to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) mott insulating ground state , as observed.@xcite in our studies we observed a strong preference for fm alignment , versus the commonplace antiferromagnetic ( afm ) alignment that often arises on the simple cubic lattice of perovskite oxides .",
    "ba@xmath4lioso@xmath5 however orders antiferromagnetically , which for nearest neighbor antialignment exchange coupling leads to frustration of ordering .",
    "all calculations reported here for either compound are for fm orientation .",
    "we study specifically the effects of spin orientation on the electronic structure , and initiate a study of the pressure dependence of bnoo considering the zero pressure lattice constant and at 1% , 2% , and 5% reduced lattice constants .",
    "the present first - principles dft - based electronic structure calculations were performed using the full - potential augmented plane wave plus local orbital method as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite the structural parameters of bnoo with full cubic symmetry of the double perovskite structure were taken from experimental x - ray crystallographic data:@xcite @xmath36=8.28   , @xmath37=0.2256 . non - overlapping atomic sphere radii of 2.50 , 2.00 , 1.80 , and 1.58 a.u . are used for the ba , na , os , and o atoms , respectively .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled with a minimum of 400 k points during self - consistency , coarser meshes were sometimes found to be insufficient .    for the exchange - correlation energy functional for treating strongly correlated insulators , a variety of approaches in addition to dft+u exist and have been tested and compared for a few selected systems.@xcite as mentioned above , for technical reasons ",
    "the relevant orbital is an octahedron cluster orbital rather than the standard localized , atomic - like orbital encountered in @xmath8 oxides ",
    "the lda+u method is problematic .",
    "we have chosen to apply the onsite exact exchange for correlated electrons ( eece ) functional introduced and evaluated by novak and collaborators.@xcite , implemented similarly to common use in hybrid ( mixture of hartree - fock and local density exchange ) .",
    "this oeehyb functional is an extension of the dft+u method to parameter - free form : exact exchange with full anisotropy is evaluated for correlated orbitals ( os @xmath11 orbitals here ) without explicit reference to any ( screened or unscreened ) hubbard u repulsion or hund s exchange interaction j@xmath35 .",
    "the double counting term is evaluated directly from the density of the occupied correlated orbitals , again without any input parameters .",
    "the exact exchange is calculated within the atomic sphere in atomic - like fashion ( hence `` onsite '' ) .",
    "the onsite exact exchange replaces 25% of the local density exchange .",
    "this functional is implemented in the wien2k code,@xcite and we refer to it here as oeehyb . for the semilocal exchange - correlation functional , the parametrization of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof@xcite ( generalized gradient approximation ) is used .",
    "soc was included fully in core states and for valence states was included in a second - variational method using scalar relativistic wave functions,@xcite a procedure that is non - perturbative and quite accurate for @xmath32 orbitals even with large soc .",
    "this oeehyb method has some kinship with hybrid exchange - correlation functionals ( see tran _",
    "et al._@xcite for a comparison of several hybrids ) .",
    "hybrids replace some fraction @xmath38 , typically 25% , of local density exchange with hartree - fock exchange , which then is approximated in various ways to reduce the expense to a reasonable level .",
    "the oeehyb approach deals with exact exchange only for correlated orbitals , however , making it appropriate for correlated materials but it will not increase bandgaps of ionic or covalent semiconductors .",
    "we note that as an alternative to the commonly used dft+u approach , the more conventional hybrid exchange - correlation functional as implemented in the vasp code@xcite has been applied to the iridate na@xmath4iro@xmath39 by kim _",
    "et al._@xcite to obtain the magnetic insulating ground state .",
    "projected densities of states ( pdoss ) are presented in fig . [ dos_fig1 ] for bnoo at the experimental volume using oeehyb , initially without soc and with full cubic symmetry .",
    "the fermi level ( taken as the zero of energy ) lies in a deep pseudogap , due to small band overlap .",
    "all @xmath9 orbitals participate equally at this level , evident from the observation that the pdos is distributed almost equally over the os @xmath9 orbitals and the @xmath34 orbitals of the six neighboring o ions , a very strong hybridization effect that has been emphasized before.@xcite    the conventional picture of a mott insulating state in a @xmath40 shell is that a single orbital , say @xmath41 , is occupied , and the crystal symmetry is broken ( and must be broken in the calculation ) to sustain , indeed to allow , occupation of a single orbital . however , due to the large soc which is expected to produce a substantial orbital moment which requires occupation of a complex ( _ viz . _",
    "@xmath42 ) orbital , we have foregone this intermediate step of obtaining orbital - ordering broken symmetry , which would typically be the final result for a @xmath8 ion with negligible soc .",
    "adding soc to oeehyb , the result mentioned above , which necessarily lowers the symmetry , leads to a soc - driven mott insulating state with a 0.2 - 0.3 ev gap , depending on the direction assumed for the magnetization .",
    "it is for this reason that we use the oeehyb functional to model bnoo , as we have previously reported that the lda+u approach was unable to open a gap.@xcite the gga+u method is more promising , but it requires an unphysically large value of @xmath43 = 6 ev to open a gap for [ 001 ] orientation .",
    "one can obtain a band gap along for [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] orientations in gga+u with u values of 3.2 ev and 2.0 ev , respectively.@xcite    our calculated band gaps , provided in table [ table1 ] , depend on direction of the magnetization , which experimentally can be manipulated with an applied field .",
    "it should be kept in mind that symmetry is lowered by including soc , and the resulting symmetry depends on the direction of magnetization . for spin along [ 001 ]",
    "the band gap is lower by 70 mev than for [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] .",
    ".calculated spin , orbital , and total ( @xmath44=@xmath45+@xmath46 ) moments of os , and band gap of ba@xmath4naoso@xmath5 , for four values of lattice parameter and for the three high symmetry directions of the magnetization .",
    "note : the total moment per f.u .",
    "will include an @xmath470.5@xmath3 spin moment not included within the os sphere , thus primarily on the oxygen ions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the hybrid density functional has been used for the modeling of ba@xmath4naoso@xmath5 with considerable success . unlike our attempts with gga+u+soc , when soc is included , and only then , it provides a robust fm mott insulating ground state for the moment aligned along any of the three symmetry directions .",
    "thus bnoo ( and bloo ) is a @xmath48=@xmath26 mott insulator at quarter filling , driven by the combination of strong exchange - correlation and large soc .",
    "though the spin magnetization remains completely spin - up when soc is included , the large changes in the composition of the occupied orbital are driven by soc .",
    "on the scale of 0.1 - 0.2 ev which is important considering the small gap , the band structure is strongly dependent of the orientation of the magnetization .",
    "in addition , our approach predicts the [ 110 ] direction as the easy axis , as observed , though [ 111 ] is close in energy .",
    "the character of the net moment is unexpected . on the one hand , the spin and orbital moments on os",
    "are 0.5 and -0.4@xmath3 , respectively , leaving a net moment on os of 0.1@xmath3 , similar to earlier indications.@xcite however this value leaves most of the total moment of 0.6@xmath3 arising from the oxygen ions in the oso@xmath5 cluster .",
    "the observed ordered moment is  @xmath470.2@xmath3 thus indicates somewhat larger compensation , or small spin contribution , than our results provide .",
    "another unusual feature found here is that for spin along [ 001 ] , there is a 0.1@xmath3 orbital moment on the apical oxygen ion .",
    "this surprisingly large value can not arise from the very small soc on oxygen ; rather it is the hybridization of the os @xmath49 combination with the @xmath50 orbital that transfers orbital angular momentum to o. this effect does not operate for other spin orientations .",
    "we acknowledge many useful conversations with k .- w .",
