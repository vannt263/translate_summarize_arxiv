    "the free magnetic energy is the maximum amount of energy that can be released in an active region of the solar corona , such as during a solar flare , a filament eruption , or a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) .",
    "thus , it is important to design reliable methods and tools that can calculate the amount of free energy in order to quantify the energy budget in a catastrophic energy release event , as well as for estimating upper limits in forecasting individual events in real - time . traditionally , the free energy is calculated by computing the nonpotential field @xmath7 with a numerical nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) code and a potential field @xmath8 for the same photospheric boundary data @xmath9 , so that the difference of the magnetic field energy density integrated over a volume @xmath10 encompassing the active region of interest can be quantified as @xmath11 this standard method may not necessarily reflect the correct amount of maximum free energy released during a solar flare , since the magnetic field in the photospheric boundary @xmath9 may change during a flare ( see measurements by wang 1994 , 2002 , 2004 , 2013 ; wang , 1997 , 2006 ; wang and liu , 2010 ) .",
    "another problem with nlfff codes using the photospheric vector field is the non - force - freeness of the lower chromosphere ( metcalf 1995 ; derosa 2009 ) , which however , can be ameliorated by preprocessing the magnetic boundary data , using chromospheric field measurements ( metcalf 2005 ; jing 2010 ) , or by a multigrid optimization that minimizes a joint measure of the normalized lorentz force and the divergence of the magnetic field , as proposed by wiegelmann ( 2004 ) and applied by jing ( 2009 ) . a quantitative comparison of nlfff computation methods , however , revealed a substantial scatter of free energies in the order of @xmath5 ( of the potential energy ) , depending on the numeric code , the boundary specifications , and the spatial resolution ( schrijver 2006 ; derosa 2009 ) .",
    "alternatively , some studies show that the free energy is better estimated by the minimum - energy state above the linear force - free field with the same magnetic helicity ( woltjer , 1958 ; rgnier and priest , 2007 ) .",
    "since nlfff calculations are rather computing - intensive for forward - fitting tasks to coronal constraints , which requires many iterations ( for an overview and discussion of different numerical methods see recent reviews by aschwanden ( 2004 ) or wiegelmann and sakurai ( 2012 ) ) or faster non - numerical methods are desirable . some proxy of the active region s",
    "free magnetic energy has been defined based on the twist and magnetic field orientation near the neutral line ( falconer 2006 , 2011 ) .",
    "free magnetic energies have been calculated for a variety of solar phenomena , for instance for the evolution of the free magnetic energy during flux emergence and cancellation , using nlfff codes ( fang 2012 ) , for the evolution of active regions ( kusano 2002 ) , for helmet - shaped streamer configurations ( choe and cheng , 2002 ) , or for breakout cmes , using mhd simulations ( devore and antiochos , 2005 ) .",
    "theoretical studies quantify the evolution of free magnetic energy for dipolar ( rgnier , 2009 ) and quadrupolar magnetic configurations with a null - point , using different force - free models ( rgnier , 2012 ) .",
    "an analytical approximation of a nonlinear force - free magnetic field ( nlfff ) solution was developed in paper i ( aschwanden , 2012 ) , while a numerical code that performs fast forward - fitting of this nlfff approximation to coronal 3d loops and a line - of - sight magnetogram has been described and tested in paper ii ( aschwanden and malanushenko , 2012 ) . in this paper iii of the series we are concerned with the calculation of the free energy , generally defined by the difference of the magnetic energies between the nonpotential field and the potential field ( equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "we calculate free energies from simulated data ( from paper ii ) , from the analytical nlfff solution of low and lou ( 1990 ) , from active region noaa 10930 during an x3.4 flare modeled by schrijver ( 2008 ) and malanushenko ( 2012 ) , and from stereoscopically triangulated loops observed with stereo ( aschwanden 2012 ) .",
    "section 2 describes the analytical treatment , section 3 the application to simulated datasets and observations , section 4 contains a discussion , and section 5 the conclusions .",
    "in paper i ( aschwanden , 2012 ) we derived an analytical approximation of a nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) solution , which fulfills maxwell s divergence - free equation ( @xmath12 ) and the force - free equation @xmath13 with second - order accuracy ( of the force - free parameter @xmath14 ) . the analytical approximation can be specified by a radial field @xmath15 and an azimuthal field component @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where ( @xmath21 ) are the spherical coordinates of a single magnetic field component ( @xmath22 with a unipolar magnetic charge @xmath23 that is buried at position ( @xmath24 , has a depth @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] , a vertical twist @xmath26 , and @xmath27^{1/2}$ ] is the distance of an arbitrary coronal position @xmath28 to the subphotospheric location @xmath29 of the buried magnetic charge .",
    "the force - free parameter @xmath14 is expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath30 , which quantifies the number @xmath31 of full twist turns over a ( loop ) length @xmath32 , @xmath33 this analytical approximation is divergence - free and force - free to second - order accuracy in the parameter @xmath34 , which is approximately proportional to the force - free parameter @xmath14 as defined by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "a general magnetic field configuration can be composed by a superposition of @xmath35 twisted magnetic field components , @xmath36 which also fulfils the divergence - free and force - free condition with second - order accuracy in @xmath14 ( or @xmath30 ) .",

    "the nonpotential energy corresponds to the sum of the potential energy and the free energy @xmath53 according to equation ( 1 ) and figure 1 . since the energies scale with the square of the magnetic field components , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , the pythagoras theorem can be applied and it follows that @xmath15 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 form a rectangular triangle , with @xmath39 perpendicular to the potential field component @xmath57 .",
    "3 .    the free energy quantifies an excess of nonpotential magnetic field energy compared with the potential field energy , and thus should have a positive scaling with the force - free parameter @xmath14 .",
    "since the free energy scales proportional to the square of the azimuthal magnetic field component ( equation ( 10 ) ) , we have a positive scaling , which is approximately @xmath58 ( equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) ) .",
    "4 .    the free energy vanishes asymptotically ( @xmath59 ) with vanishing force - free parameter @xmath60 or @xmath61 , with the potential field being the limit , @xmath62 .",
    "5 .    the total nonpotential magnetic energy integrated over an arbitrary large height @xmath63 converges to a finite value , @xmath64 .",
    "we can prove the finiteness of the potential energy for a single magnetic charge , which has a square - dependence of the magnetic field , @xmath65 , yielding a 4th - power dependence of the magnetic energy @xmath66 , and thus a 3th - power dependence for the integrated magnetic energy , @xmath67 .",
    "for a finite amount of twist and a finite number of magnetic sources , it can be shown that the integral of the resulting nonpotential energy is also finite .",
    "while the foregoing definition of the free energy is calculated for a single twisted ( buried ) magnetic charge , how can it be generalized for a superposition of an arbitrary number of magnetic charges , as defined in equation ( 7 ) ?",
    "the sum of the magnetic field contributions from each buried magnetic charge component @xmath68 add up to the nonpotential field vector @xmath7 , which can be decomposed into two orthogonal components @xmath69 and @xmath70 in every point of space @xmath38 , @xmath71 where the parallel component is aligned with the potential field direction , @xmath72 , and the perpendicular component is orthogonal to the potential field direction , @xmath73 .",

    "both methods are fitting the same line - of - sight component of the photospheric boundary @xmath83 given by the magnetogram , while the non - potential magnetic field affects the transverse field components @xmath84 and @xmath85 that are not used as a boundary condition in our forward - fitting method .",
    "an alternative method is to estimate the free energy in an active region from the misalignment angle @xmath86 between the potential field and the observed coronal loops , or the best - fit nonpotential field . using the coronal loops as a proxy for the nonpotential field",
    ", this would provide a very fast method that requires only the computation of a potential field , supposed we have the 3d coordinates of coronal loops , from stereoscopic triangulation . since the mean azimuthal field component is @xmath87 and the mean radial ( potential ) field component is @xmath88 , the nonpotential energy ratio @xmath89 follows then directly , using the definition of equation ( 11 ) , for the free energy , @xmath90 where the relative misalignment angle @xmath91 is defined as the difference between the ( median ) potential @xmath92 and ( median ) nonpotential field directions @xmath93 , @xmath94 ideally , if the nlfff forward - fitting code matches the coronal loops perfectly ( with @xmath95 ) , and thus the relative misalignment angle of the potential field to the loops can be used , @xmath96 . however , in reality there is always a significant difference between the best - fit nlfff solution and the observed loop data , either due to stereoscopic measurement errors or due to an additional field misalignment that can not be described with the particular parameterization of our nlfff approximation .",
    "we perform now tests of the calculation of the free magnetic energy using the definitions given in equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) for four different datasets , using ( 1 ) simulated data produced by our analytical nlfff approximation , ( 2 ) the nlfff solution of low and lou ( 1990 ) with a known exact analytical solution , ( 3 ) active region noaa 10930 during an x3.4 flare modeled by schrijver ( 2008 ) and malanushenko ( 2012 ) , and ( 4 ) stereoscopic data from four observed active regions .",

    "first , the misalignment angle between the forward - fitted nonpotential field and the simulated loops is in all 12 cases ( p1, ... ,n12 ) significantly smaller ( @xmath116 ) than the initial potential field misalignment angle @xmath117 , which confirms a satisfactory convergence of the forward - fit to the simulated target loops .",
    "second , all ratios of nonpotential to potential energies @xmath118 are larger than one , which means that the free energy @xmath0 is always positive with our definition given in equation ( 12 ) .",
    "third , all 12 simulated cases agree in the nonpotential energy ratio with the simulated input model , @xmath119 with an accuracy of less than @xmath120 , which also confirms the perfect convergence of the forward - fit algorithm .",

    "the misalignment angle is reduced from @xmath144 to @xmath145 for case l1 , and from @xmath146 to @xmath147 for case l2 , so the forward - fitting reduces the misalignment by about a factor of 3 .",

    ", the median misalignment angle of @xmath154 for the potential field was reduced by about a factor of 2.6 to @xmath155 for the best - fit nonpotential nlfff solution ( case s1 in table 1 ) .",
    "we measure a potential - field energy of @xmath156 erg before the flare ( s1 ) , and @xmath157 erg after the flare ( s2 ) , so a small difference of @xmath158 . for the nonpotential magnetic energy ratio we measure @xmath159 before the flare and @xmath160 after the flare , and similar values with the misalignment method , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",

    "the free energy ratio was measured with 14 different nlfff codes in schrijver ( 2008 ; table 1 therein ) , which yield energy ratios of @xmath167 before the flare , and @xmath168 after the flare , if we average all methods with equal weight .",
    "however , the most reliable nlfff method among them , according to a quality assessment by visual inspection of five magnetic features seems to be the @xmath169 nlfff code , which yields an energy ratio of @xmath170 before the flare and @xmath171 after the flare , so a decrease of 13% in the free energy , corresponding to a drop of @xmath172 erg in free energy , similar to our measurement with the misalignment method ( @xmath173 erg or 13% ) .",
    "similarly , malanushenko ( 2012 ; cases with 3d fits labeled as ii.b in table 1 therein ) calculates energy ratios of @xmath174 before the flare and @xmath175 after the flare , corresponding to a drop of 13% in the free energy .",
    "thus all three studies agree with a drop in free energy , by an amount of @xmath176 according to our two methods , versus @xmath166 for the most reliable nlfff codes , while lower free energy values and larger misalignment angles result for the other nlfff codes ( table 1 in schrijver 2008 ) .",

    "this result implies that the magnitude of the flare ( measured here with the goes soft x - ray flux ) is directly related to the free magnetic energy stored in the active region before the flare .",
    "if we include the x3.4 goes flare of ar 10930 ( figure 8 , case s1 ) , we see that the observed free energy ratio @xmath198 lies along the same trend of the extrapolated exponential function .",
    "also the free energy @xmath190 , an absolute measure of the nonpotential energy , shows a correlation with the observed goes flux , approximately following a powerlaw ( figure 8 , bottom ) , @xmath199 with the constants @xmath196 ( w m@xmath197 and @xmath200 erg .",
    "only the active region ( b ) with the lowest free energy is an outlier to this powerlaw relationship .",
    "compared with the other ( numerical ) nlfff codes , our analytical nlfff code has the following advantages : ( 1 ) computational speed that allows fast forward - fitting to observed coronal data ; ( 2 ) simplicity of explicit analytical formulation ; ( 3 ) spherical geometry of solar surface is fully implemented ; and ( 4 ) the free energy meets the five criteria of positivity , additivity of energy ( or orthogonality of magnetic field components ) , positive scaling with force - free parameter @xmath14 , potential field limit for small @xmath14 s , and finiteness of nonpotential energy . in this study",
    "we calculated the free magnetic energy for four different test datasets and aim to validate the accuracy .",
    "the first test dataset consists of simulated loops , which are analytically defined by the same parameterization as the magnetic field lines that are forward - fitted to the simulated data .",
    "we find that the total nonpotential magnetic energies @xmath98 are retrieved with an accuracy of @xmath201 for these cases , and the free energy ratios @xmath118 are retrieved with an accuracy of @xmath202 .",
    "the high accuracy just confirms the convergence behavior of our code in the case of a unique solution , as it is the case when the forward - fitting model has the same parameterization as the fitted simulation dataset .",
    "the second test dataset consists of an analytical nlfff solution , which has a completely different parameterization in terms of the green s function applied to constant-@xmath14 point sources ( chiu and hilton , 1977 ; low and lou , 1990 ; lothian and browning , 1995 ; malanushenko 2009 , 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "the particular case described in low and lou ( 1990 ) consists of three smooth elliptical magnetic field concentrations and contains an amount of 13% free energy , while we recovered only 2% with the forward - fit .",
    "the poor performance is possibly due to the particular topology of the low and lou ( 1990 ) model , which has extended ( elliptical ) magnetic field regions parameterized with smooth legendre polynomials , which can not be fitted uniquely with spherical point sources .",
    "however , because this case is untypical for solar observations , which appear to consist of many small - scale flux concentrations that can be easier fitted with point sources , the accuracy of free energies may be much better for real solar data .",
    "the third data set consists of an observed flaring active region with a large x3.4 flare , for which a nlfff solution was calculated . for the free energy we obtain a value of order 11%-18% before the flare , which approximately agrees with the most reliable nlfff solution ( 16%-32% ) computed in schrijver ( 2008 ) and malanushenko ( 2012 ) .",
    "also for the sign of the change in nonpotential magnetic energy during this x3.4 flare we obtain the same sign and a similar value for the decrease of free energy ( @xmath176 ) as the values computed in schrijver ( 2008 ) and malanushenko ( 2012 ) , @xmath203 .",
    "the fourth test dataset consists of four solar active regions , for which the 3d coordinates of coronal loops could be stereoscopically triangulated .",
    "for these four cases we obtained free energies of 0.6% , 2.3% , 4.4% , and 8.5% . only for the first case ( active region a , 2007 april 30 ) we have comparisons with other nlfff codes .",
    "the most reliable nlfff code that exhibits the smallest misalignment angle with stereoscopic loops , yield 3% free energy , which is close to our result of @xmath204 . the free energy obtained from all 11 nlfff solutions yields a much larger scatter , @xmath205 ( table 1 in derosa 2009 ) .",
    "we found a correlation between the free magnetic energy and the goes flux of the largest flare that occurred during the observing period ( equation 16 ) .",
    "since our nonpotential field solution is parameterized by a vertical twist of magnetic charges , the free energy is directly proportional to the magnetic energy associated with the azimuthal field component @xmath39 , and thus approximately proportional to the squared force - free @xmath14 parameter or the number @xmath31 of twists per length unit , ( equations ( 10 ) and ( 6 ) ) , @xmath206 on the other side , the stress - induced heating rate @xmath207 by ohmic dissipation ( or joule dissipation ) is proportional to the square of the currents , ( van ballegooijen , 1986 ) , which is also proportional to the square of @xmath14 ( with @xmath208 ) , and thus to the free energy , @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the classical conductivity .",
    "thus we can express equation ( 16 ) in terms of twists , currents , or heating rates , @xmath211 our empirical finding suggests that the energy radiated from the heated plamsa is not just proportional to the heating energy , but `` exponentiated '' by the current density @xmath212 , the force - free parameter @xmath14 , the number of twists @xmath31 , or the heating rate @xmath207 of joule dissipation .",
    "this implies a highly nonlinear mechanism that converts vertical twist into thermal radiation via dissipated currents , as envisioned in stress - induced reconnection ( sturrock and uchida , 1981 ; parker , 1983 ) .",
    "our linear regression fit of the free energy versus the goes flux yields a lower limit of @xmath213 , which corresponds to a goes - class z4-event , about the magnitude of the smallest detectable nanoflare .",
    "the largest flare among our analyzed cases is an x3.4 goes - class flare .",
    "apparently , the exponential relationship between soft x - ray flux and free energy discovered here holds even approximately for large goes x - class flares ( figure 8) .",
    "the nonlinearity is also reflected by the fact that the thermal energy of the soft x - ray flux is not just proportional to the free magnetic energy , but rather exhibits a highly nonlinear powerlaw function with a powerlaw index of @xmath214 ( equation ( 17 ) ) .",
    "we calculated the total free magnetic energy contained in a coronal volume encompassing an active region for four different kinds of datasets : ( 1 ) simulated data , ( 2 ) data created from an analytical nlfff solution by low and lou ( 1990 ) , ( 3 ) a flaring active region , and ( 4 ) four active regions observed with stereo and soho / mdi .",
    "the free magnetic energy @xmath0 is defined by the difference of the nonpotential ( @xmath98 ) and the potential magnetic field energy ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the nonpotential magnetic field @xmath7 is defined by an analytical approximation of a nlfff solution that is parameterized by buried magnetic charges with vertical twists ( derived in paper i ) .",
    "the numerical code that performs fast forward - fitting of magnetic field lines to coronal 3d constraints , such as stereoscopically triangulated loops , is described in paper ii , along with the simulated data .",
    "our findings are as follows :    1 .   a first method to calculate the free energy results from forward - fitting of our analytical nlfff approximation by associating the perpendicular magnetic field component @xmath215 with the free energy , @xmath216 , while the parallel component @xmath217 is associated with the potential field energy @xmath218 .",
    "this definition of the free energy fulfills the conditions of ( i ) positivity of free energy , ( ii ) additivity of energies , @xmath219 and orthogonality @xmath220 , ( iii ) a positive scaling with the force - free parameter , @xmath221 , ( iv ) the potential - field limit , @xmath222 , and ( v ) the finiteness of the nonpotential energy with height @xmath223 , @xmath224 .",
    "a second method to estimate the free energy can be obtained from the mean misalignment angle @xmath225 between a potential and a nonpotential field ( or stereoscopically triangulated coronal loops ) .",
    "the free energy ratio is then @xmath226 .",
    "we find that the uncertainty of this method amounts to @xmath227 for the nonpotential magnetic energy .",
    "3 .   calculating the free energies for the simulated data we find a high fidelity of order @xmath120 in retrieving the free energy , which is due to the fact that the simulated data have the same parameterization as the forward - fitting method , constraining a single best - fit solution .",
    "4 .   calculating the free energy for the low and lou ( 1990 ) analytical case ,",
    "our nlfff code finds a significantly lower value than theoretically calculated , probably because of the special morphopology ( parameterized with smooth legendre functions ) , which can not adequately be fitted with our nlfff code that is designed for spherical magnetic point sources , as found in solar magnetograms .",
    "5 .   calculating the free energy for observed active regions constrained by the 3d coordinates of stereoscopically triangulated coronal loops",
    ", we find free energy ratios of @xmath228 .",
    "the uncertainty of the free energy determined with our forward - fitted nlfff approximation appears to be at least as good as the uncertainty among other ( standard nlfff extrapolation ) codes .",
    "we find also a correlation between the free magnetic energy @xmath190 and the goes flux of the largest flare that occurred during the observing period , which can be quantified by an exponential relationship , @xmath229 , implying an exponentiation of the dissipated currents .    in summary",
    ", this study demonstrates that the free energy in active regions can be calculated and predicted with our analytical nlfff approximation with an accuracy that is commensurable with other standard nlfff codes .",
    "our code has the additional advantages of computational speed for forward - fitting of coronal data , correct treatment of the curved solar surface , positivity , and finiteness of free energy .",
    "in addition , forward - fitting of our nlfff approximation achieves a significantly smaller misalignment angle with respect to the observed coronal loops ( @xmath230 ) , compared with the results of other nlfff codes ( @xmath231 ; derosa 2009 ) .",
    "the most limiting drawback of our method is the availability of stereoscopic data with suitable spacecraft separation angle ( which was most favorable in 2007 , the first year of the stereo mission ) . in future work",
    "we attempt to circumvent the 3d geometry of coronal loops by using only the 2d projections of coronal loops , which can ( manually or automatically ) be traced from loop - rich euv or soft x - ray images and do not require stereoscopic data at all .",
    "the author appreciates the provided data and helpful discussions with anna malanushenko and marc l. derosa .",
    "part of the work was supported by nasa contract nng 04ea00c of the sdo / aia instrument and the nasa stereo mission under nrl contract n00173 - 02-c-2035 .",
