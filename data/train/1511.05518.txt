    "since its discovery , the cherenkov radiation@xcite became a very useful tool for particle registration and investigation of their properties .",
    "given the fact that particles emit light only moving above some speed threshold , it became possible to distinguish between them experimentally .",
    "nowadays , there exist a variety of the so called cherenkov counters which are based on the effect .",
    "in the very beginning of the cherenkov radiation research , several papers@xcite were published concerning its quantum and polarization properties . and even at the present moment a strong interest to the effect still exists , resulting in the considerable amount of articles@xcite either devoted to this problem or concerning it from some point of view .",
    "at the present moment , several quantum approaches to this phenomenon are known , although they all rely on the evaluation of the s - matrix element .",
    "some of calculations are performed very explicitly and , therefore , the results have rather cumbersome form . in this paper ,",
    "the calculations are made with use of the invariant amplitude technique , where the polarization density matrix@xcite approach is applied in the case of the spin-1/2 particles .",
    "this approach allows to obtain the intermediate and final expressions in a very compact form .",
    "the calculation results for the scalar field could be applied to the cherenkov radiation of the @xmath0 mesons , while the results for the spinor field case could be applied to the cherenkov radiation of any charged spin-1/2 particle .",
    "a natural system of units is used , i.e. , @xmath1 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "in the frame of classical electrodynamics , the cherenkov radiation problem is solved by the calculation of the energy losses due to the medium polarization by a charged particle . in the most cases ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    ", the analysis starts from the maxwell equations in the medium treating a particle as a point - like source of electromagnetic field .",
    "further steps require obtaining the expression for the effective force that causes energy losses due to the radiation .",
    "these techniques could be learned from the above mentioned references .",
    "there exist several ways to represent the final result : in terms of the effective force , in terms of the energy losses spectrum per unit time ( or length ) , etc .",
    "the transition from one representation to another is trivial . in this article",
    ", it is found convenient to write the classical formula as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of photons emitted by the charged particle in the time interval @xmath4 and in the angular frequency interval @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the particle s velocity , @xmath7 is its charge , and @xmath8 is the refractive index of the medium .",
    "this result is bounded by the condition : @xmath9    also the angle @xmath10 between the initial particle s momentum @xmath11 and the photon s wave - vector @xmath12 must satisfy the following relation : @xmath13    omitting the detailed derivation that could be found in classical papers or textbooks , it is worth mentioning the intuition that stays behind the expressions ( [ bound_speed ] ) and ( [ classical_angle ] ) .",
    "when a particle moves at a velocity below the speed of light in the medium , the resulting field undergoes a destructive interference . in the superluminal case , the particle outstrips its wavefront that results the latter having a conic surface due to the constructive interference which we treat as an outgoing particle , i.e. a photon .",
    "for this to be valid , the relation ( [ bound_speed ] ) should be satisfied .",
    "as for the expression ( [ classical_angle ] ) , it could be verified by the geometrical considerations .",
    "according to the quantum field theory , it is necessary to consider the @xmath14 process where @xmath15 is a charged particle , scalar or spinor . due to the energy - momentum conservation law",
    ", this process is forbidden in vacuum .",
    "another way of looking onto this limitation is the zero value of the reaction s phase volume : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the 4-momenta of the photon , initial and final electrons , respectively .",
    "as opposed to the vacuum case ( @xmath20 ) , in the medium ( @xmath21 ) one has : @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the polarization operator s eigenvalue ] .    in this case , @xmath24 is not zero and the reaction becomes possible . from the energy - momentum conservation law",
    ", it follows : @xmath25 thus leading to a slight decrease of the angle if compared with ( [ classical_angle ] ) .    in order to calculate the number of the cherenkov photons emitted per second , the conventional method is applied .",
    "it relies on the notion of the s - matrix element : @xmath26 extracting by the standard procedure the invariant amplitude @xmath27 , one arrives to the differential ( per unit time ) probability of the process by the integration over the reaction s phase volume : @xmath28 it can be treated as the amount of photons emitted per second by a charged particle through the cherenkov mechanism .",
    "having @xmath29 represented in the form @xmath30 the spectrum for @xmath29 , @xmath31 , i.e. the number of emitted photons per unit time per interval of the angular frequency @xmath32 , could be extracted from ( [ width1 ] ) .    in the original expression ( [ width1 ] ) , the integration is made over @xmath33 , and therefore @xmath34 appears in the final answer . the desirable form ( [ width2 ] )",
    "could be obtained by the next procedure .    in the medium , there arises a charge shielding , so it is necessary to account for radiative corrections .",
    "this leads to the following substitution : @xmath35 where the renormalization factor has the form : @xmath36    having @xmath37 and making the substitution ( [ renormalization ] ) , one arrives to the following rule : @xmath38 ) hence takes the form : @xmath39    it might look like the radiative correction would complicate the analytical evaluation of the integral , but in fact it leads to the simple transition from @xmath34 to @xmath32 : @xmath40",
    "let s consider the cases of scalar and spinor fields .",
    "the explicit forms of the respective field operators , scalar ( @xmath41 ) , spinor ( @xmath42 ) and electromagnetic ( @xmath43 ) are : @xmath44 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath47 are the bispinors corresponding to the possible particle s polarizations ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 are the electromagnetic polarization vectors . the respective creation and annihilation operators of the fields are denoted as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this paper , the following gauge is chosen for @xmath43 : @xmath53    in this gauge , only two polarizations are present with their vectors being orthogonal to each other and to the photon s wave - vector .",
    "they are also taken to be real , i.e. : @xmath54 for further integration purposes , the _",
    "z_-axis is chosen to be along @xmath55 , _ x _ and _ y _ axes could be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "this leads to the following expressions : @xmath56 where @xmath10 and @xmath41 are the corresponding spherical angles .",
    "to analyse the final results for the partial amplitudes it is convenient to choose the polarization vectors as follows : @xmath57    throughout the calculations the following notations are used : @xmath58 , `` hatted '' vector @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    for the spinor case the notion of the polarization density matrix is used , both , partial : @xmath61 and summed over the possible fermion s polarizations : @xmath62    here , @xmath63 is the 4-dimensional polarization vector which characterizes the fermion s spin properties . in the rest frame",
    "it has the following form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is twice the mean spin vector in the fermion s rest frame . under the lorentz boost it transforms to : @xmath66    using these formulas",
    ", one could perform calculations of the corresponding matrix elements for the cases of the scalar and spinor particles .",
    "the lagrangian of the electromagnetic interaction for the scalar field has the form : @xmath67 for a partial invariant amplitude of the process @xmath14 one obtains : @xmath68 @xmath69      in the case of the spinor dirac field , the interaction lagrangian could be written as : @xmath70 the corresponding partial invariant amplitude would look as follows : @xmath71    first , let s sum the square of ( [ spinor_amplitude ] ) over the final fermion s polarizations and average over the initial ones : @xmath72 ) over the photon polarizations results in : @xmath73 integration over the phase space leads to final formula for the spectrum : @xmath74    for further analysis , it is also interesting to estimate the spin flip probability by the consideration of the corresponding partial amplitudes . starting with the square of ( [ spinor_amplitude ] ) and the explicit form ( [ density_matrix_partial ] ) of the partial polarization density matrix ,",
    "one arrives to : @xmath75 summing ( [ spinor_amplitude2_partial3 ] ) over the photon polarizations , one gets : @xmath76 ratio is taken to be a small parameter , as it will be discussed later , and therefore @xmath77 denotes the expression of order @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "let s analyze the obtained results . expressions ( [ scalar_spectrum ] ) and ( [ spinor_spectrum ] ) coincide up to the @xmath80 linear term .",
    "they differ in quadratic terms due to the spinor nature of the fermion field . for the typical values of the parameters ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) these terms",
    "are negligible if compared with the linear one , and therefore one could conclude that _ irrespective of the field type , scalar or spinor , the quantum correction is the same . _",
    "the resulting formula @xmath84 is in a good accordance with the existing results and , as expected , turns into the classical one , eq .",
    "( [ classical_formula ] ) , in the limit of low frequencies .    a relative correction to the number of emitted photons predicted by the classical formula ( [ classical_formula ] ) is given by @xmath85 thus being dependent on the medium through the refractive index @xmath8 .",
    "but in the very special case when @xmath6 tends to @xmath86 , the expression ( [ final_formula ] ) turns into @xmath87 therefore leading to the simplification of ( [ correction1 ] ) : @xmath88 obviously , _ in the case when @xmath6 tends to @xmath86 the relative quantum correction is independent of the medium .",
    "_ this fact could have some use in the precise measurements of quantum corrections to the cherenkov radiation if the corresponding techniques would be improved . at the present moment it is less likely to measure such a small divergence .",
    "next , one would like to consider the polarization properties of the emitted light .",
    "let s call the plane where @xmath55 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 vectors lie as the plane of propagation . from ( [ scalar_amplitude2 ] )",
    ", it follows that for the scalar field all radiation would have the polarization vector lying in that plane because of the partial amplitude for @xmath91 which is equal to zero",
    ". that would nt be so for the spinor field . in ( [ spinor_amplitude2_summed_ss ] )",
    "there is a small correction term @xmath92 , hence resulting in additional radiation with the polarization vector having a component perpendicular to the plane of propagation .",
    "but as far as the order of magnitudes in this problem ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) is such as it s been previously mentioned , this term could be neglected .",
    "therefore , _ for both cases , scalar and spinor , the emitted radiation is polarized in the plane of propagation_.    another interesting feature follows from the spin flip consideration . in the final formula for the partial amplitudes summed over the photons polarizations ( [ spinor_amplitude2_partial4 ] ) there are terms of order @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "they are negligible if compared with the @xmath93 term , and therefore could be omitted . because of the relatively low value of the photon s energy and momentum the initial and final values of the electrons energy and momentum could be taken as equal . from this",
    ", one could notice that it is possible to write @xmath63 and @xmath94 as follows : @xmath95    as long as @xmath96 , expression ( [ spinor_amplitude2_partial4 ] ) simplifies to @xmath97 ) spin orientations is highly suppressed , while the conservation of spin projection to the @xmath65-axis is promoted_.",
    "to the best knowledge of the author , the statement about the coincidence of the quantum corrections for the scalar and spinor fields hasnt been previously mentioned in the papers concerning the quantum properties of the cherenkov radiation .",
    "the medium independence of the relative quantum correction in the case when @xmath6 tends to @xmath86 , despite its evidence , also hasnt been explicitly pointed out in the literature .",
    "polarization properties of the radiation were established experimentally by p.cherenkov himself and were presented in the original paper@xcite , their theoretical treatment in the frame of classical electrodynamics also exists . in this paper",
    ", it was found convenient to write the polarization conditions ( [ scalar_amplitude2 ] ) and ( [ spinor_amplitude2_summed_ss ] ) in the explicitly covariant form in terms of the partial amplitudes of the considered process , also showing that they apply both for the scalar and spinor cases . speaking about the spin flip , it is worth saying that this fact was first theoretically established by ginzburg@xcite who studied the change in what we now call as helicity . in this paper",
    ", the `` spin flip '' condition is investigated by the means of the polarization density matrix , therefore not limiting the spin axis to the direction of propagation .",
    "being a very powerful tool for the particle registration and investigation of their properties , the cherenkov radiation effect is still open for new ideas .",
    "the purpose of this work was to fill the gaps concerning scalar fields and relative quantum corrections , at the same time providing the convenient framework for the polarization and spin flip considerations based on the notion of the polarization density matrix .",
    "the results obtained in this paper , being purely theoretical at the moment , might have practical use in the future in case of the measurement technique improvement .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of nikolay vladimirovich mikheev who originally proposed the idea to study the cherenkov radiation of the scalar particles and quantum corrections to it .",
    "also , the author would like to thank a.v.kuznetsov for his valuable comments and corrections .",
