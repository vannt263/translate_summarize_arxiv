    "we study super - alfvnic outflows in the relativistic limit , taking into account thermal - pressure effects and allowing for the presence of a finite poloidal field component ( which is required for angular - momentum transport by the flow ) .    as in paper",
    "i and in @xcite , we consider a debris disk around a black hole with a massive - star progenitor as a specific example of a long - duration grb source .",
    "if the outflow emanates from a region of characteristic cylindrical radius @xmath4 and radial width @xmath5 ( where the subscript @xmath6 denotes quantities evaluated at the disk surface ) , and if the disk injects energy into the flow mostly in the form of a poynting flux over a time interval @xmath7 , then the total injected energy ( from the two surfaces of the disk ) is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electric field amplitude . in the trans - alfvnic case @xmath10 , and one infers @xmath11^{1/2}\\ g\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath12 on the right - hand side is typically @xmath13 for trans - alfvnic flows",
    ".    a massive star could give rise to a black - hole / debris - disk system in at least three ways : ( 1 ) a prompt ( within @xmath14 of core collapse ) formation in which no supernova shock is produced ( the `` type i collapsar '' scenario ; e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) a delayed ( within @xmath15 of core collapse ) formation resulting from fallback in a failed supernova explosion ( the `` type ii collapsar '' scenario ; e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( 3 ) a strongly delayed ( by a period of weeks to years ) formation resulting from the collapse ( following the loss of rotational support through a pulsar wind ) of a rapidly rotating , massive neutron star created in a successful supernova explosion ( the `` supranova '' scenario ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in the latter scenario , the initial magnitude of @xmath16 in the debris disk would not exceed typical radio - pulsar values ( @xmath17 ) , and in the type i collapsar picture the magnitude of an inward - advected large - scale poloidal field would likely be even lower . in the type ii collapsar scenario it is in principle possible for a strong poloidal field to develop on the scale of the stalled supernova shock on account of either convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a hydromagnetic instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the ability of these mechanisms to produce ordered disk poloidal fields of the required magnitude remains questionable . in any case , most of the long - duration grbs observed to date are interpreted in the collapsar picture as being of the type i variety @xcite .",
    "the most promising mechanism of creating strong fields in debris disks is through shear amplification of the seed poloidal field by the strong ( keplerian ) differential rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this process generates azimuthal fields that can greatly exceed the poloidal field component inside the disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , who considered this mechanism in the contexts of both a debris disk and a newly formed neutron star , suggested that the wound - up field would rise buoyantly but not necessarily axisymmetrically and could emerge from the disk ( or stellar ) surface as a flux rope with @xmath18 of order the amplified @xmath19 .",
    "a similar scenario has been proposed for the formation of active regions in the sun and has been tested by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite also suggested that repeated episodes of field windup and escape could be the origin of the observed intrinsic grb variability ( see   i.4.1.1 ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that an alternative outcome of the field winding process might be the escape of disconnected ( through magnetic reconnection ) toroidal flux loops .",
    "in this case @xmath20 could be @xmath21 .",
    "this is similar to the `` plasma gun '' scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued , on the basis of numerical simulations , that this behavior is likely to occur explosively and could be manifested by disks in which the pressure of the amplified field increases above the thermal pressure ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the field windup and reconnection cycle underlying these models was also at the basis of early models of disk magnetic viscosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recent disk - viscosity models have been based on mhd turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the debris disks invoked in grb source models are envisioned to be initially threaded by a subthermal poloidal magnetic field , which could make them susceptible to this instability .",
    "one might then wonder whether most of the energy liberated in the disk would be viscously dissipated into heat , with little left to power poynting flux - dominated outflows .",
    "although a definitive answer to this question would entail a fully global numerical investigation of the nonlinear development of the mri , existing ( radially localized ) simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that disks threaded initially by a weak poloidal field with a nonvanishing mean evolve into configurations that are magnetically dominated throughout ( and thus no longer mri - unstable ) .    in this paper",

    "@xcite examined a pure-@xmath77 , strictly radial flow without considering the transfield force - balance equation .",
    "they showed that magnetic energy dissipation ( modeled in a parameterized manner ) results in efficient acceleration @xmath262 and a final poynting - to - kinetic energy conversion efficiency @xmath263 .",
    "our fiducial solution exhibits a faster acceleration @xmath264 and a higher efficiency @xmath265 .",
    "these results indicate that both dissipation and the fieldline shape may play an important role in the flow acceleration .",
    "using the radially self - similar relativistic mhd model presented in paper i , we constructed representative `` hot '' and `` cold '' fast - rotator solutions of super - alfvnic flows .",
    "we argued that super - alfvnic outflows in which @xmath0 already at the source could plausibly arise in grb source models that invoke differential rotation in a disk or a star to account for the large magnetic field amplitudes that are required for consistency with the observations .",
    "we demonstrated that our `` frozen pulse '' formulation , despite being quasi steady , can still capture the expected time - variability of the azimuthal field component at the source .",
    "we showed that for typical source parameters the flows convert poynting flux to kinetic - energy flux with high efficiency ( @xmath266 for our fiducial solution ) and collimate to cylindrical structures on scales @xmath267 .",
    "our solutions confirm ( some previous statements in the literature notwithstanding ) that significant magnetic acceleration and collimation can take place at large distances from the source ( well beyond the light cylinder ) , although most of the collimation is achieved before the flow becomes extremely relativistic .",
    "the super - alfvnic solutions derived in this paper are distinguished from the trans - alfvnic ones obtained in paper i in two main respects : ( 1 ) during the initial thermal - acceleration phase of the `` hot '' solution , some of the internal energy is transformed into electromagnetic energy even as another part is used to increase the poloidal velocity .",
    "( the same behavior is exhibited by the `` cold '' solution , except that in that case the energy reservoir is the bulk initial rotation rather than the thermal energy . )",
    "( 2 ) during the subsequent magnetic - acceleration phase , the rate of increase of the lorentz factor with distance from the source can be significantly lower than in the trans - alfvnic case ; the rate of increase of the jet radius with distance is correspondingly higher .",
    "overall , however , , the two types of solution are quite similar , and we derived analytic scaling relations that describe them both ( see also @xcite ) . we conclude that source configurations with either @xmath268 or @xmath269 could in principle produce viable grb outflows .",
    "another potentially important aspect of such outflows , namely , the possibility that their initial composition is highly neutron - rich , can also be modeled within the theoretical framework that we have constructed .",
