    "quantum cryptography is a matured application of quantum informational theory which exploits quantum mechanical principle . in its core",
    ", there is a process called quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite generating secure key between two distant parties , alice and bob , against a possible eavesdropper called eve .",
    "there were many researches for proving security of qkd based on quantum mechanical effects @xcite and experiments for demonstrating qkd system @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the early qkd protocols use two dimensional quantum state , called qubit @xcite . due to its extensible structure , it is expected that high dimensional quantum state is able to carry more information per single quanta compared with qubit .",
    "till now , high dimensional quantum systems on photon were studied for quantum communication in a various context .",
    "there were theoretical ideas to exploit high dimensional quantum states in quantum information processing , for example , nonlocality test @xcite , entanglement measurement @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "experimentally , high dimensional quantum states are demonstrated in various quantum systems , energy - time entangled states @xcite , position and momentum entangled states @xcite , multi path - entangled states @xcite , and orbital angular momentum(oam ) mode @xcite .",
    "high dimensional quantum states are applied in qkd protocol as well .",
    "there were researches for proving security of qkd using @xmath0-dimensional quantum system which is generalized version of original qkd protocol @xcite .",
    "these results show that qkd using high dimensional quantum states has higher upper bound on the error rate that ensures unconditional security of the channel .",
    "qkd protocols using high dimensional quantum states are demonstrated by using time - energy states @xcite , spatial modes @xcite , and oam modes @xcite , so far .    in the other side of qkd investigation , security of practical qkd system",
    "has also been scrutinized in detail .",
    "many theoretical security proofs have been made under the assumptions that all devices are trusted or well characterized for perfect security .",
    "however , in a real situation , it becomes necessary to inspect the case that untrusted devices are used seriously because they may be produced by eavesdropper or they just can not be operated as expected . on the other hand ,",
    "attack models which exploit imperfect devices , called side channel attack , are proposed and demonstrated recently .",
    "they were photon number splitting ( pns ) attack @xcite , faked - state attack @xcite , detector efficiency mismatch attack @xcite , detector blinding attack @xcite , time - shift attack @xcite , and laser damage attack @xcite . from the study of hacking qkd system",
    ", it is known that imperfection of devices in the system brings serious security problems .",
    "there are security patches for each of the attacks , for example using decoy states for preventing pns attack @xcite , but we need to defend all attacks even including undiscovered one for ensuring perfect security of qkd .    in order to extend the notion of ultimate security , device - independent qkd ( di - qkd ) protocol is proposed in 2007 @xcite . in the di - qkd study , they proposed a secure qkd scheme that is independent of the device imperfection while the security is guaranteed by nonlocal correlation identified by clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) type inequality @xcite .",
    "however , it has been turned out that di - qkd is not easy to be implemented in practice because it requires high quality entanglement source , low - loss against noisy channel and highly efficient detectors . compensating the practicality , measurement - device - independent qkd ( mdi - qkd ) protocol is proposed in 2012 @xcite . in mdi - qkd scheme , all types of possible side channel attack exploiting imperfection of detectors",
    "are overcome by separating detectors from alice and bob . for the separation , potentially untrusted third party ,",
    "called charlie , is introduced for their qkd .",
    "alice and bob send their encoded photon to charlie , then charlie performs a special type of composite measurement on his incoming photon pair , called bell state measurement ( bsm ) . after the bsm",
    ", charlie announces the measurement result to alice and bob through the classical channel , then the two party establish the correlation between their photon when their encoding bases are same . from the fact that charlie only act as a referee for the correlation between alice and bob , he can not access to the encoded message as like eavesdropper and it guarantees the unbounded security between alice and bob .",
    "thus , by using mdi - qkd , we can overcome the most of side channel attacks when the major security issues are attributed to the imperfections of detectors @xcite .",
    "the other advantage of mdi - qkd is that no entanglement is needed like bb84 protocol .",
    "there were several experiments to demonstrates mdi - qkd using different physical systems , _",
    "e.g. _ with time - bin states @xcite and polarization states @xcite . especially , the latter realized the long distance mdi - qkd over 200 km @xcite .    in the mean",
    "while , the practical mdi - qkd still suffers from its low key rate compared with bb84 protocol together with high quality requirement that the communication source should satisfy .",
    "mdi - qkd needs bsm setup that has only 50% success probability using linear optical elements @xcite .",
    "such the success probability of bsm is mainly responsible for a low key generation rate of mdi - qkd .    in this work",
    ", we propose mdi - qkd protocol using 3-dimensional quantum state ( 3@xmath0-mdi - qkd ) which allows the improvement of the secret key rate compared with the original protocol using qubits .",
    "in the security analysis , we focus on asymptotic key rates .",
    "we analyze the security of 3@xmath0-mdi - qkd under the assumption that the states generated from communication sources are not ideally prepared , which is called the uncharacterized sources assumption .",
    "we use the mismatched - basis statistics in security analysis for 3@xmath0-mdi - qkd with uncharacterized sources as it is proposed for qubit mdi - qkd in @xcite . here , we show that there is the improvement of the security in 3@xmath0-mdi - qkd compared with qubit mdi - qkd in theoretical model , even if the communication sources are uncharacterized .",
    "we simulate the secret key rate of 3@xmath0-mdi - qkd with the change of the realistic experimental factors and identify the regime where 3@xmath0-mdi - qkd is more secure than qubit mdi - qkd .",
