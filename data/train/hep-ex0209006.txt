    "the measurement of magnetic moments has been important in advancing our knowledge of sub - atomic physics since the famous 1921 paper of stern,@xcite which laid out the principles of what we now call the `` stern - gerlach experiment '' .",
    "the experimental and theoretical developments in the study of the electron s magnetic moment represent one of the great success stories of modern physics , with the experiment reaching a relative accuracy of @xmath3 parts in @xmath4 ( parts per billion)@xcite and the theory being constrained by our knowledge of the fine - structure constant @xmath5 , rather than by the eight - order and tenth - order qed calculations.@xcite    the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spin angular momentum , and @xmath9 is the magnetic moment resulting from this angular momentum .",
    "the dirac equation predicts that @xmath10 , but radiative corrections increase the value at the part per mil level .",
    "the particle data tables define the magnetic moment as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the anomalous magnetic moment ( or simply the anomaly ) .",
    "when e821 began in the early 1980s , @xmath13 was known to 7.3 parts per million ( ppm).@xcite the e821 collaboration has reported three new measurements with relative accuracies of 13 , 5 and 1.3 ppm respectively.@xcite    to the level of the experimental accuracy , the electron anomaly can be described by the qed of @xmath14 and photons , with the contribution of heavier virtual particles entering at a level below 4 ppb .",
    "the larger mass of the muon permits heavier virtual particles to contribute , and the enhancement factor is @xmath15 .",
    "the cern measurement observed the effect on @xmath13 of virtual hadrons at the 10 standard deviation level.@xcite the standard model value of @xmath13 consists of qed , strong interaction and weak radiative corrections , and a significant deviation from the calculated standard model value would represent a signal for non - standard model physics .",
    "the method used in the third cern experiment and the bnl experiment are very similar , save the use of direct muon injection into the storage ring which was developed by the e821 collaboration .",
    "they are based on the fact that for @xmath16 ( or more precisely @xmath17 ) the spin gets ahead of the momentum vector when a muon travels transversely to a magnetic field .",
    "the larmor and thomas spin - precession and the momentum precession frequencies are @xmath18 and the difference frequency gives the frequency with which the spin precesses relative to the momentum , @xmath19 which is proportional to the anomaly , rather than to the full magnetic moment .",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath13 requires precision measurements of the precession frequency @xmath20 and the magnetic field .",
    "the muon frequency can be measured as accurately as the counting statistics and detector apparatus permit . the design goal for the nmr magnetometer and",
    "calibration system was a field accuracy of about 0.1 ppm .",
    "the @xmath21 which enters in eq .",
    "[ eq : omeganoe ] is the average field seen by the ensemble of muons in the storage ring , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the azimuthal angle around the ring , @xmath24 are the coordinates at a single slice of azimuth centered at the middle of the 90 mm diameter muon storage region .",
    "@xmath25 is the moment ( multipole ) distribution of the muon distribution , and couples multipole by multipole with the magnetic field .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain adequate information on the higher moments of the muon distribution in the storage ring , so the presence of higher multipoles in the magnetic field is undesirable .",
    "the need for vertical focusing implies that a gradient field is needed , but the usual magnetic gradient used in storage rings is ruled out in our case .",
    "a sufficient magnetic gradient for vertical focusing would spoil the ability to use nmr to measure the magnetic field to the necessary accuracy , and would also require detailed knowledge of the muon distribution .",
    "an electric quadrupole is used instead , taking advantage of the `` magic ''  @xmath26 at which an electric field does not contribute to the spin motion relative to the momentum .",
    "this can be understood from the famous thomas - bmt equation @xmath27 , \\label{eq : tbmt}\\ ] ] which reduces to eq .",
    "[ eq : omeganoe ] in the absence of an electric field .",
    "note that for muons with @xmath28 in an electric field alone , the spin would follow the momentum vector .",
    "the arrangement of a magnetic dipole field combined with an electric quadrupole field is called a penning trap in atomic physics . however with a 14 m diameter and @xmath29 t weight ,",
    "the scale of our trap is quite different from the usual one.@xcite    in order to meet the conditions discussed above , a goal of @xmath30 ppm uniformity of the @xmath31-field over the storage region was set and met .",
    "a round beam profile was chosen , since sharp corners would imply large higher moments for @xmath25 .",
    "given the projected knowledge of the muon distribution , the allowable strength of the quadrupole and higher magnetic multipoles was also determined .",
    "the quadrupoles are arranged in a four - fold symmetry covering 43% of the ring .",
    "this geometry has the advantage that @xmath32 to about 5% so the beam does not breathe very much , making the average field calculation easier .    in our optimal running conditions ,",
    "the 24 gev / c proton beam in the ags is accelerated in 12 proton bunches , each with an intensity of about @xmath33 protons .",
    "the bunches are extracted one at a time at 33 ms intervals , and brought down a transport line to a ni production target .",
    "the time distribution of the proton beam has @xmath34 ns . the ags cycle time is about 2.8 s.    pions at @xmath35 are momentum analyzed and then brought into a 72 m straight fodo decay channel where muons are born . a second momentum slit permits one to choose forward muons about 1.6% below the pion momentum .",
    "these forward muons have @xmath36% longitudinal polarization , and are injected into the ring where their spin precesses .",
    "we store on the order of @xmath37 muons per fill of the ring .    unlike the conventional storage ring made of lumped elements , the requirement of a field uniform at the ppm level precluded breaks in the storage ring magnet .",
    "thus the beam must be brought in through the fringe field of the storage ring to a point close the the central orbit .",
    "this is achieved by the use of a 1.7 m superconducting inflector magnet@xcite which nulls the field where the beam enters , but does not leak flux into the storage region , spoiling the precision field .",
    "an elevation view of the inflector exit , and the magnet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : infgeo2 ] .",
    "this unconventional set of conditions means that there is no phase - space matching between the incoming beam and the storage ring .",
    "this mismatch reduces the calculated injection efficiency to @xmath38% .     56  mm@xmath39 ( ignoring the chamfer on the outer radius corners ) .",
    "[ fg : infgeo2],width=283 ]    a kick of about 0.1 tm is needed to bring the beam onto a stable orbit .",
    "this is achieved with three 1.7 m long ferrite - free kickers,@xcite which can be thought of as single - loop pulsed magnets carrying a current of 4,200 a. the minimum inductance achievable of 1.6 @xmath40h limited the peak current to 4200a , and resulted in a current - pulse width @xmath41 times greater than the cyclotron period .",
    "this less than optimal kicker pulse reduces the injection efficiency to about 7.3% .",
    "nevertheless the number of stored muons per fill is almost a factor of 100 over that available in the final cern experiment,@xcite and the injection - related background seen by the detectors is down by a factor of 50.@xcite    the precision magnetic field is at the heart of the experiment.@xcite a profile of the storage ring magnet is given in fig .",
    "[ fg : magcross ] .",
    "the air - gap dominates the reluctance of the magnetic circuit , and the pole - pieces are made of very low carbon , high quality magnet steel .",
    "the angle of the iron wedge in the air gap is used to eliminate the quadrupole inherent in a `` c '' magnet , and the wedge can be moved radially to adjust the dipole locally .",
    "the pole bumps were ground individually to minimize the sextupole component , and the pole face windings ( programmable current sheet ) permit one to minimize the higher multipoles ( on average ) , which do not vary much around the ring .",
    "the success in shimming the magnet can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fg : field1 ] and [ fg : field2 ] , which show the average field from 1999 and 2000 .",
    "the poorer field quality in 99 came from a damaged passive superconducting shield around the inflector , which permitted flux leakage into the storage ring . in 2000",
    "the damaged inflector was replaced , and we met the goal of @xmath30 ppm uniformity .",
    "several important parameters of the storage ring are given in table [ tb : ring ] .",
    "the experimental signal is the @xmath14 from @xmath42 decay .",
    "muon decay is a three - body decay , so the 3.1 gev muons produce a continuum of positrons ( electrons ) from the endpoint energy down .",
    "since the highest energy @xmath14 are correlated with the muon spin , if one counts high energy @xmath14 as a function of time , one gets an exponential from muon decay modulated by the @xmath0 precession .",
    "the expected form for the positron time spectrum is @xmath43   \\label{eq:5pm}\\ ] ]    however , a fourier analysis of the residuals from this five parameter fit shows a number of frequency components which can only be understood after a discussion of the beam dynamics in the ring ( see fig .",

    ".parameters of the storage ring . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : freq ]    the tune plane is shown in fig.[fg : tunepl ] which shows resonance lines up to fifth order .",
    "of the three @xmath44-values used for data collection , the @xmath45 tune had a cbo frequency uncomfortably close to the second harmonic of @xmath0 ( see table [ tb : freq ] putting an am sideband just by the @xmath0 frequency .",
    "this nearby sideband and has forced us to to work very hard to understand the cbo and how its related phenomena affect the value of @xmath20 from the fits to the data .",
    "the 2001 data set was taken with the other two tunes , which substantially reduced our sensitivity to the cbo .",

    "three tools were available to us to monitor the muon distribution . by studying the beam debunching after injection",
    ", one can gain information on the distribution of equilibrium radii in the storage ring . a wire chamber system",
    "located at one position around the ring permitted us to measure the trajectories of the @xmath14 and by tracing the trajectory back to the point where it is tangent to the ring , reproduces the decay position to within a few mm .",
    "the ring was equipped with two sets of scintillating fiber beam monitors which could be plunged into the storage region .",
    "each set consisted of an @xmath46 and @xmath47 plane of seven 0.5 mm diameter scintillating fibers which covered the beam region .    in fig .",

    "however , a sign mistake in a small piece of the theoretical hadronic contribution improved the agreement to 1.6 @xmath48 .",
    "we have an additional data set with @xmath49 which will have a total error of around 0.8 ppm , and also a @xmath50 data set which should also have a similar error , although the distribution between statistical and systematic errors is different for the two data sets .",
