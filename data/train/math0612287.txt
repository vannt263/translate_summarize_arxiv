    "in this research announcement , we point out that the @xmath0tv functional , introduced and studied in the continuous setting in @xcite and earlier in the discrete setting in @xcite , provides a convenient way of computing both the value of , and the optimal decomposition required by , the _ flat norm _ from geometric measure theory .    the @xmath0tv functional",
    "was introduced as an improvement to the now classic rudin - osher - fatemi total variation based denoising  @xcite . among its many nice properties",
    "are the way it handles binary images , making it useful for shape processing . theoretically speaking",
    ", the clean geometric structure of the functional and its minimizers is very attractive .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "joan glauns was , as far as we know , the first to suggest and use the _ flat norm _ from geometric measure theory as a distance in shape space . in his dissertation",
    "@xcite and a couple of application papers  @xcite with collaborators , the dual formulation of the flat norm is used to compute distances between shapes .    * acknowledgements * : it is a pleasure to acknowledge bill allard and bob hardt for useful discussions and joan glauns and sarang joshi for inspiring this work .",
    "additionally , the second author acknowledges useful discussions with selim esedoglu .",
    "the @xmath0tv functional introduced and studied in  @xcite is given by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions from @xmath4 to @xmath5 with @xmath3 being the input function . in image analysis applications",
    ", @xmath6 is usually 2 and @xmath3 is the measured image intensity function .",
    "the optimal @xmath2 minimizing  ( [ eq : l1tv ] ) can be thought of as a _ denoised _ version of @xmath3 .",
    "typically , one chooses the parameter @xmath7 based on noise levels since this choice selects the scale below which features or oscillations are ignored . in the case that the input function is binary , chan and esedoglu observe that the functional reduces to : @xmath8 where the binary minimizer is @xmath9 , the binary input is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the perimeter of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 denotes the symmetric difference .",
    "of course @xmath14 denotes the characteristic function on @xmath15 , with a value of 1 on @xmath15 and 0 on the complement of @xmath15 .",
    "now , let @xmath16 be a binary minimizer of  ( [ eq : set - l1tv ] ) .",
    "i.e. @xmath17 for our convenience , we record the optimal decomposition of @xmath18 into @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the pair @xmath21 .    in",
    "what follows , we use the notions of _ current _ , _ mass _ and _ @xmath22 _ and supporting ideas from geometric measure theory .",
    "we introduce and explain these in some detail in the appendix .",
    "informally , one can gain much by thinking of the _ n - current _ @xmath23 as an orientable n - submanifold or n - rectifiable set @xmath24 with an orientation , of the _ mass _ @xmath25 as the @xmath6-dimensional volume of @xmath15 , and of @xmath26 , the boundary of @xmath27 , as the oriented boundary of @xmath15 with orientation imposed by the orientation of @xmath15 .",
    "we sometimes omit the subscript indicating the support of the current , referring to currents @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "for those without experience with currents , we suggest focusing the examples in the the appendix .",
    "the _ flat norm _ of an @xmath6-current @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath28 varies over @xmath31-currents and @xmath32 is the _ mass _ of the indicated currents .",
    "we refer to @xmath33 as the flat norm induced , optimal decomposition . now for results .    for the current @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "is the optimal decomposition required by the flat norm .",
    "[ thm : litvfn ]    theorem  [ thm : litvfn ] says that l1tv computes the flat norm .",
    "this relation between the flat norm and the l1tv functional immediately suggests a very useful generalization of the flat norm .",
    "@xmath37    theorem  [ thm : litvfn ] is then simply a special case of the next theorem .    for the current @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "is the optimal decomposition that the flat norm with scale requires .",
    "[ thm : litvfn - ws ]    the proof is really simply checking that the picture one can draw holds after the definitions of _ mass _ ( @xmath32 ) and _ perimeter _ ( @xmath40 ) are used to translate the picture into analytic terms .",
    "very briefly , we have : @xmath41 figure  [ fig : symmetric - diff - picture ] illustrates this pictorially .",
    "our final observation is that the _ flat norm with scale _ gives us the same decomposition as we would get if we first scaled @xmath27 , computed the _",
    "flat norm _ decomposition and then reversed the scaling .",
    "more precisely    denote the optimal @xmath42 decomposition by @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the @xmath7-dilation of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the minimizing decomposition @xmath43 which minimizes @xmath48 also minimizes @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , to get the minimizer for @xmath42 run the optimization required by @xmath50 using @xmath51 as input , and then contract with @xmath52 .",
    "we now discuss applications and examples with pictures which should clarify things for those with less exposure to geometric measure theory .",
    "the value of the above results is fully realized by exploring their use in applications to images and shapes . as observed by glauns and others ,",
    "the flat norm is a very natural candidate for distances between shapes .",
    "we now very briefly explore and illustrate applications of the above observations .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : l1tv - flat ] , by letting the @xmath53 , one has a natural way to vary the intrinsic scale in the flat norm .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 represents @xmath56 .",
    "the main point here is that this is easy to compute , given the connection to the @xmath0tv functional .",
    "varying @xmath7 gives us the ability to choose what scale is big and worth keeping .",
    "see figure  [ fig : scale - dependence - picture ] .",
    "we can use the @xmath0tv functional to very easily calculate _ both _ the flat norm of differences between surfaces which are boundaries _ and _ the optimal decomposition of that difference into surface and area parts . in figure",
    "[ fig : l1-through - flat - decomp ] , the decomposition of a boundary current @xmath57 into the diminished boundary @xmath58 and the symmetric difference current @xmath59 is illustrated .",
    "the dual formulation of the flat norm can be used to compute @xmath0tv minimizers . in what follows ,",
    "we define @xmath60 to be the support of @xmath27 .",
    "the following results establish that maximizing forms , or in some cases , maximizing sequences of forms , contain the decomposition into @xmath28 and @xmath61 .",
    "suppose that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a smooth , compactly supported @xmath6-form satisfying @xmath64 and @xmath27 is an @xmath6-rectifiable current with density @xmath65 @xmath66 almost everywhere on @xmath67 , then on the support of @xmath68 @xmath69 and on the support of @xmath61 , @xmath70 [ prop : maxform ]    for a minimizing choice of s , we have that @xmath71 and @xmath72 so that @xmath73    we know @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 on @xmath78 . similarly for @xmath79 .",
    "we immediately get that @xmath80 , @xmath81 almost everywhere and @xmath82 , @xmath83 almost everywhere .",
    "see figure  [ fig : square - form - example ] for an example maximizing form .",
    "note that when @xmath28 is not unique , this proposition implies that @xmath82 on the union of supports of all possible minimizing @xmath28 s .    if we do not have a maximizing form",
    ", we have the following modified proposition together with the fact that there will be sequence of forms @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "this easily yields    suppose that @xmath86 .",
    "then there is a subsequence of @xmath84 , @xmath87 such that @xmath88 @xmath89 almost everywhere and @xmath90 @xmath83 almost everywhere .",
    "[ prop : maxseq ]    this modified proposition is necessary since there are easily constructed examples having no smooth maximizing form .",
    "in fact , the example shown in figure  [ fig : square - form - example ] is not actually smooth .",
    "the optimizing @xmath91 we show is actually lipschitz , so it can be arbitrarily well approximated by smooth forms even though it is not itself smooth .",
    "the non - smoothness originates at the points of @xmath61 where the circular arcs join the sides of the square tangentially . at these points ,",
    "the boundary is merely @xmath92 .",
    "note that propositions  [ prop : maxform ] and  [ prop : maxseq ] are true if @xmath63 and @xmath91 are merely measurable wrt the measures @xmath93 and @xmath83 .",
    "we now state an outline of a reasonable set of steps that would be very useful for computations using the dual formulation of the flat norm .",
    "suppose that @xmath27 is integer density rectifiable with rectifiable boundary @xmath26 and that both @xmath27 and @xmath26 have finite mass .",
    "define @xmath94 to be the collection of all lipschitz forms @xmath63 maximizing @xmath95 and satisfying @xmath96 and @xmath77 . define @xmath97 to be the closure of the set on which @xmath98 for every @xmath99 . finally , define @xmath100 to be the collection of all optimizing currents @xmath28 such that @xmath101",
    ". then    1 .",
    "there is an @xmath102 such that both @xmath28 and @xmath103 are integer density rectifiable .",
    "2 .   @xmath104 3 .",
    "@xmath105 4 .",
    "@xmath80 on @xmath106 .",
    "part ( a ) says that although we are not constraining the minimizing currents to be rectifiable , there is at least one in the set of minimizers that is .",
    "part ( b ) says that there are always maximizing forms if we permit them to be merely lipschitz instead of smooth .",
    "part ( c ) enables us to see where the possible locations for an @xmath28 might be and finally , part ( d ) gives us @xmath61 .",
    "we do not expect the refinement and proof of the conjecture to be simple .",
    "the few previous works in this direction , for example federer s 1974 paper  @xcite `` real flat chains , cochains and variational problems '' , are rather technical in nature .",
    "notice also that this conjecture is only necessary for a rigorous foundation to the use of the dual formulation in the computation of the flat norm decomposition .",
    "direct optimization over rectifiable currents needs nothing from this conjecture for its justification .",
    "a very simple example where lipschitz forms are necessary and sufficient for optimality is the case in which the current is three equally spaced circles on a torus .",
    "see figure  [ fig:3-lines - example ] .",
    "note that the metric on the torus is chosen such that the circles are parallel .",
    "figure  [ fig:3-lines - example - function ] shows the @xmath107 of a lipschitz maximizing form @xmath108 . in the case shown of equal spacing between circles ,",
    "we ca nt maximize with a smooth form and a maximizing sequence must approach the form plotted in figure  [ fig:3-lines - example - function ] . in this case , the region between the @xmath109 and @xmath110 circles or the region between the @xmath110 and @xmath111 circles is the optimal @xmath28 .",
    "this non - uniqueness is taken into account in the above conjecture .    finally , the above propositions , example and conjecture have obvious analogs for @xmath42 , the flat norm with scale .      computing the flat norm decomposition for arbitrary currents permits us to extend the @xmath0tv denoising to sets which are not boundaries or have co - dimension greater than 1 .",
    "one approach is to use the dual formulation of the flat norm .",
    "this depends on extracting the optimal decomposition from the optimizing form , as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "another approach is to directly optimize over currents .",
    "we are currently developing both approaches .",
    "figure  [ fig : co - dimension-2 ] schematically illustrates the decomposition of a 1-current in 3d that results when the flat norm is computed .",
    "this example actually illustrates both of the useful generalizations possessed by the flat norm decomposition : regularization or denoising of higher co - dimension and non - boundary subsets .",
    "notice that the use of the flat norm with scale permits us to choose what scale is small and therefore greatly diminished , and what scales are large and therefore preserved . in the case of sets which are co - dimension 1 boundaries , we know that in a very precise sense , the regularized surface given by @xmath106 is the best @xmath7-curvature approximation to @xmath27 .",
    "see  @xcite for details .      as noted above",
    ", the flat norm was previously suggested for shape comparisons in  @xcite and then used in  @xcite for the purpose of computing shape statistics .",
    "our observation permits us to use @xmath0tv algorithms to compute the flat norm distance for many shapes in shape space and the flat norm decomposition that gives this distance .",
    "the decomposition that we get as a result shows us where the difference is big with respect to @xmath7 and where it is small .",
    "see figure  [ fig : shape - diff ] .",
    "the innovations introduced in this paper simultaneously expand the methods available for computing @xmath0tv minimizers , generalizes @xmath0tv to non - boundary and higher codimensional subsets , opens up a new method for multiscale shape decompositions , and supports the previous suggestion of glauns et al . that the flat norm is useful as a distance in shape space .",
    "difficulties include the fact that non - boundary 0-currents i.e. sets of signed points in @xmath4 not arising as the endpoints of a family of curves , seem rather clumsy to handle . for some applications",
    "the global curvature bound enforced by the method might be too limiting .",
    "one can imagine a situation in which the curvature of the approximation should be allowed to vary from place to place on the input current or set .",
    "one might in fact desire something that returns a denoised set whose use as a local mean generates a local variance inversely proportional to the locally allowed curvature .",
    "it is not as easy to handle noise in @xmath27 in the form of gaps or missing pieces of @xmath27 . of course",
    ", missing pieces means that @xmath27 is not a boundary .",
    "one approach is to first denoise @xmath26 and then add the resulting @xmath28 to @xmath27 to fill in many or all of the gaps .",
    "then @xmath113 can be denoised to remove oscillations by computing the optimal @xmath42 decomposition .",
    "but then the denoising process requires two steps , each involving a choice of @xmath7 and this seems a bit clumsy . on the other hand",
    "this might make sense scientifically since the process by which holes and oscillations are generated may be quite different with different associated length scales",
    ".    in conclusion the program suggested by the relatively simple observation of the relation between @xmath0tv and the flat norm promises many new benefits .",
    "many of these benefits are immediately accessible while others depend on the some further developments outlined above .",
    "these , as well as the general expansion of the above announcement is the subject of several papers that are in preparation or in planning with collaborators .",
    "if you know something about currents and have a clear picture of the flat norm , this section can be skipped .",
    "the reference for this section is frank morgan s nice introduction  @xcite .",
    "the definitive , though formidable , treatise for a fair bit of geometric measure theory is still federer s 1969 tome  @xcite .",

    "we are    often interested in the case where    @xmath118 .",

    "we    will usually suppress the @xmath116 and refer simply    to @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we    restrict ourselves to integer multiplicity rectifiable currents    @xmath27 , which have the following representation :    @xmath124 where @xmath115 is an    @xmath6-rectifiable set in @xmath119 ,    @xmath125 is an integer multiplicity density function ,    always @xmath126 in this paper , @xmath63 is the    form @xmath27 is operating on , and @xmath127 is the    unit , simple @xmath6-vector defining the orientation on    @xmath115 . recall that a simple @xmath6-vector is the    wedge product of @xmath6 vectors . in our case ,    @xmath127 can be thought of as an oriented representation    of the tangent plane to @xmath115 at @xmath128 .",
