    "the average persistent current @xcite of a large number of mesoscopic metallic rings can be used to deduce the sign and the magnitude of electron - electron interactions in the metal forming the rings .",
    "the size of the average current is expected to increase with the strength of the interactions , and its sign reflects the nature of the interactions : the magnetic response at low flux is paramagnetic ( diamagnetic ) when the electronic interactions are repulsive ( attractive).@xcite for a large ensemble of rings , the current is expected to be periodic in the magnetic flux , with the period corresponding to one half of the flux quantum , @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical analysis of refs . and was motivated in part by early measurements of the average persistent current in an array of @xmath1 copper rings , @xcite whose sign and magnitude could not be accounted for by noninteracting electrons alone and therefore should be affected by electronic interactions .",
    "these experiments confirmed the above periodicity , also suggesting that the average magnetic response is induced by interactions .",
    "@xcite similar results were later observed on an array of @xmath2 gaas rings @xcite and on an array of @xmath2 silver rings .",
    "@xcite in contrast , measurements on single rings@xcite showed the @xmath3 periodicity . in an array of 30 gold rings@xcite both the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 harmonics",
    "were observed . in this paper",
    "the authors were unable to say whether the @xmath0 signal was the second harmonic of the typical contribution or the first harmonic of an average contribution .",
    "overall , the sign of the @xmath0 harmonic measured on metallic rings seems to indicate that the low - flux response is diamagnetic , @xcite implying attractive interactions .",
    "recently , bleszynski - jayich _",
    "et al._@xcite found that the average current in aluminum rings , subject to high magnetic fields , is negligible , but typical mesoscopic fluctuations remain almost unaffected .",
    "it seems that these latter experiments can be explained within the framework of noninteracting electrons .",
    "@xcite    interestingly enough , it turned out that the _ bona fide _ values of the attractive interactions required to explain the persistent - current data of the copper @xcite ensemble for example , would have implied that this metal is superconducting at measurable temperatures , of the order of 1mk .",
    "in fact , early experiments on the magnetic response @xcite and on the thermal conductivity@xcite of proximity - effect systems , whose normal parts were copper and silver , also indicated a minute attractive interaction in these metals.@xcite however , these early measurements allowed a broad range for the magnitude of this interaction , and therefore did not open a discussion of the reasons for the absence of superconductivity in experiments on these metals .",
    "the latter puzzle became obvious only after the measurements of the persistent current on copper , which requires a transition temperature of 1mk .",
    "superconductivity has not been detected also in gold and silver , and this fact has remained unexplained for many years . a possible explanation for this apparent puzzle @xcite was offered in refs .   and  , which argued ( for the first time ) that the existence of ( seemingly unavoidable@xcite ) tiny amounts of magnetic impurities may detrimentally affect superconductivity in such metals , reducing their transition temperatures to undetectable , even zero , values , while leaving the persistent current almost unharmed .",
    "this stems from the disparity of the energy scales determining the renormalized electronic interaction pertaining to each phenomenon .",
    "the interaction - induced persistent current is proportional to the renormalized interaction on the scale of the thouless energy , @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath6 is the circumference of the ring ) .",
    "superconductivity is lost , however , when the spin - flip rate of the magnetic impurities , @xmath7 ( in units of energy ) , becomes comparable to the _ bare _ transition temperature of the material ( in the absence of any pair - breaking or pair - weakening agents ) , @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , the actual superconducting transition temperature @xmath9 is determined by the",
    "_ renormalized _ interaction , on the scale of @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "it follows that a concentration of magnetic impurities such that @xmath11 will hardly affect the magnitude of the persistent current , concomitantly suppressing the superconducting transition temperature ( below we often use units in which @xmath12 ) . indeed , detailed analysis @xcite of the persistent current data reported in refs . and led to the conclusion that @xmath8 of copper ( gold ) is in the mk ( a fraction of mk ) range .",

    "width=188 ]    this theoretical picture can be tested , for instance , by investigating rings made of known low - superconducting - transition - temperature materials , in which a controlled concentration of pair breakers have been added.@xcite it has also been noted that the magnetic flux itself acts as a pair breaker , causing a periodic decrease of the transition temperature but a lesser decrease in the persistent current .",
    "@xcite it is interesting to check whether there exist other situations where the superconducting transition temperature is lowered by some pair - breaking or pair - weakening mechanism , but the ( superconducting fluctuation - induced ) persistent current remains large far above this transition temperature . in the present paper",
    "we consider this question for superconducting - normal ( @xmath15 ) bilayers , e.g. made of al and cu.@xcite bilayers made of al and ag might even be better , as they avoid magnetic impurities .",
    "the ` normal ' metal could also be a weaker superconductor , with a lower transition temperature .",
    "the proximity effect is known to cause a decrease of the transition temperature of the bilayer with the relative thickness of the @xmath16 layer,@xcite and it is interesting to find out what happens to the persistent current , which is induced by superconducting fluctuations .",
    "this possibility is in particular intriguing : unlike the magnetic impurities , the proximity effect is not a _ bona fide _ pair - breaker , since time - reversal invariance is not broken by it .",
    "the proximity effect just leads to pair - weakening , by ` diluting ' the superconducting fraction .",
