    "interplay between superconductivity and the onset of electronic spin and charge modulations in cuprate superconductors remains one of the intriguing and unresolved issues in the field of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "manifestations of electronic modulations are reported in a broad doping range for several families of cuprates  most noticeably around the doping level of 1/8@xcite .    for 1/8-doped lanthanum cuprates ,",
    "the modulated structure is widely believed to exhibit one - dimensional pattern often referred to as  stripes \" @xcite . yet the principal aspects of the same experimental evidence are also consistent with the possibility of two - dimensional modulations called  checkerboards \" @xcite .    the experiment - based arguments discriminating between stripes and checkerboards in 1/8-doped lanthanum cuprates are at present rather indirect . at the same time",
    ", the issue can not be resolved on purely theoretical grounds , because it requires accuracy of the calculations of the ground state energy not achievable by first - principles theories .",
    "the checkerboard was , initially , less popular as an interpretation of experiments , in part , because of the perception that it inhibits the electronic transport in all lattice directions and hence prevents the onset of superconductivity as well .",
    "the latter point , however , was challenged by a model of superconductivity in the background of a checkerboard modulation @xcite .",
    "that model was based on a particular version of a checkerboard called  grid \" .",
    "later , the grid checkerboard was shown to be inconsistent with the results of spin - polarized neutron scattering experiment of ref.@xcite .",
    "this experiment , however , did not rule out another version of a checkerboard representing a two - dimensional arrangement of spin vortices@xcite shown in fig.[fig : checkers ] .",
    "somewhat similar noncollinear spin textures were also considered in refs .",
    "the general properties of spin - vortex checkerboard were analyzed in refs.@xcite .",
    "so far , however , the superconductivity model developed for grid@xcite has not been generalized to the spin - vortex checkerboard . in the present article",
    ", we introduce such a generalized model , find its mean - field solution and compare it with experiments .",
    "it should be remarked here that , experimentally , the onset of static spin modulations in 1/8-doped lanthanum cuprates  spin vortices or stripes  largely suppresses three - dimensional superconductivity but appears to coexist with two - dimensional superconductivity @xcite . for both spin vortices and stripes ,",
    "the suppression of the three dimensional superconductivity can be explained by the displacement of the modulation patterns in the adjacent cuo@xmath1 planes . beyond 1/8-doped lanthanum cuprates ,",
    "the generic situation possibly involves the fluctuating counterpart of the static spin - vortex texture used in the present work .",
    "these fluctuations are likely caused by system s proximity to the threshold of electronic phase separation @xcite .",
    "they are expected to couple spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom  see e.g.@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the spin - vortex checkerboard just suggests us the coupling connectivity between low - energy fermionic states .",
    "as it stands , the model illustrates the potential of the general two - component scenarios@xcite in the limit of initially localized components for describing the superconductivity in cuprates .",

    "the model to be considered has two different kinds of fermionic states physically located in magnetic and non - magnetic parts of the underlying spin texture .",
    "the general reasoning for constructing the model is the same as in ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , the entire texture is divided into plaquets having different kind of spin background , and then , for each plaquet , only one - particle fermionic states closest to the chemical potential are retained for the model description .",
    "given that plaquets are rather small , it can be estimated@xcite that the spacing of one - particle energies within each plaquet is of the order of 40  mev , which implies that , for temperatures much smaller than 400k , it is appropriate to retain only the levels closest to the chemical potential .",
    "we expect that the lowest one - particle states in spin - polarized plaquets are non - spin - degenerate , and hence we include exactly one state per plaquet . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : checkers ] , the texture has four kinds of spin - polarized plaquets .",
    "we refer to two of the resulting states as  a - states \" and to the remaining two as  c - states \" .",
    "two different kinds a - states are distinguished by index @xmath13 , and c - states  by index @xmath14 .",
    "two a - states or two c - states with different values of @xmath3 or @xmath4 respectively are expected to have orthogonal spin wave functions that can be obtained from each other by spin inversion .",
    "the lowest - energy states of spin - unpolarized plaquets around the cores of spin vortices are expected to be spin - degenerate .",
    "we , therefore , place two fermionic states on each such plaquet with spins  up \" or  down \" along any chosen direction .",
    "we call them  b - states \" . since the spin texture contains four nonequivalent kinds of spin - vortex cores , we distinguish the corresponding b - states by index @xmath15 and by spin index @xmath16 or @xmath17",
    " see fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] .",
    "we now construct the low - energy hamiltonian following the same reasoning as in ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , we assume that the direct one - fermion hopping between different plaquets is suppressed due to the differences of spin textures and due to the expected texture fluctuations . at the same time",
    ", we assume that fast fluctuations of the texture around the average pattern shown in fig . [",
    "fig : checkers ] induce pair transitions that do not change the center - of - mass position of the two fermions involved .",
    "this leaves us only with terms representing on - site energies @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) and with the following two - kinds of effective interaction terms , namely : two a - states or two c - states adjacent to a given spin vortex core making transitions to the two b - states inside the core or vice versa . the resulting hamiltonian is : @xmath22 } } a_{k \\text{o}_{[i,\\alpha]}}+h.c\\right)\\right.\\\\ \\left .",

    "double - subscripts notations such as @xmath30}}$ ] imply that a - states labeled as @xmath31 must be adjacent to the b - states labeled as @xmath32 .    if all terms containing c - states are removed from hamiltonian ( [ eq : originalhamlt ] ) , the result would be exactly equivalent to the hamiltonian considered in ref @xcite . since c - states do not directly couple to a - states , and",
    "since c - states have the same connectivity with the b - states as a - states ( but shifted ) , the mean - field solutions of the two models are very similar with the only difference being that b - states now experience mean field from both a - states and c - states , which , in turn , makes that mean field two times larger , and , as a result , the value of the superconducting transition temperature becomes modified .",
    "since the entire derivation has nearly the same structure and logic as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , below we only include the formal structure of the derivation and the results , leaving the justification mostly to ref . @xcite .",
    "in the model considered , each of the fermionic states couples to relatively few other states , which makes a mean - field solution only very approximate .",
    "we nevertheless proceed with finding a mean - field solution , assuming that gives at least the right qualitative picture of model s behavior .",
    "the first step of this solution is to introduce the bogoliubov transformation for @xmath33-states within the same plaquet : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are positive real numbers satisfying a constraint arising from canonical fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the transformation phases , which are to be determined later by minimizing system s energy .    substituting bogoliubov transformation for @xmath33-states ( [ eq : bgvtransb ] ) in ( [ eq : originalhamlt ] ) and keeping only the thermal averages of terms that do not change the occupations of b - states , we obtain partially averaged hamiltonian , @xmath39\\\\+ \\epsilon_{a } \\sum_{i,\\eta } a^{\\dagger}_{i\\eta } a_{i\\eta}+ \\epsilon_{c } \\sum_{i,\\eta } c^{\\dagger}_{i\\zeta } c_{i\\zeta}\\\\+gsw ( 1- 2n_{b } ) \\mathlarger{\\mathlarger{\\sum}}_{\\alpha }     \\bigg [ ( e^{-i \\varphi_{\\alpha } } \\sum_{ij } a_{j \\text{e}_{[i,\\alpha ] } } a_{k \\text{o}_{[i,\\alpha ] } } + h.c ) \\\\ + ( e^{-i \\varphi_{\\alpha } } \\sum_{ij } c_{m \\text{e}_{[i,\\alpha ] } } c_{n \\text{o}_{[i,\\alpha ] } } + h.c ) \\bigg ] , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the energy of b - quasiparticles and @xmath41 is their occupation number . + as explained in ref.@xcite , in order to assure proper fermionic anticommutation relations for the bogoliubov counterparts of a- and c - states , the bogoliubov transformation for these states should be made in the quasimomentum space .",
    "therefore , we need to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the real - space fourier transforms for a- and c- operators . to do",

    "we need to define the following vectors ( all in units of underlying crystal lattice ) : @xmath47 which connects an even a - state with an adjacent even c - state , and also vectors @xmath48 which connect an even a - state with four adjacent odd a - states .",
    "the subscript @xmath2 in @xmath49 is chosen such that @xmath2-th b - states are located between the pairs a - states connected by vector @xmath49 originated from an even a - state .",
