    "most investigations of fermionic condensed matter are based on a type of mean - field approximation popularized by bogoliubov @xcite .",
    "one recent and conspicuous example is the ten - fold way , a topological classification of fermionic systems based on three discrete  time reversal , charge conjugation , and chiral  symmetries and k - homology @xcite .",
    "the main reasons for the prevalence of the mean - field approximation are clear .",
    "first , it leads to a very intuitive and natural picture of fermionic systems thanks to landau s theory of fermi liquids and their quasi - particles .",
    "second , it leads to a mathematically simple lie - algebraic formalism by which the problem of diagonalizing the hamiltonian in fock space becomes of polynomial complexity in the total number of degrees of freedom . and",
    "last but not least , topological invariants such as ( full or partial ) chern numbers , berry phases @xcite , bott and hopf indexes , and others are easily associated to mean - field theories and evaluated for concrete instances .",
    "the thermodynamic state of a fermionic superfluid ( or superconductor ) is characterized by the _",
    "spontaneous _ breaking of the global continuous @xmath0 ) symmetry related to particle - number conservation .",
    "the positive features of the mean - field approximation for fermions come at a surprising cost in the context of superfluidity ( electrically neutral fermions ) or superconductivity ( charged fermions ) : the _ explicit _ breaking of the symmetry of particle - number conservation .",
    "however , electronic matter is composed of interacting electrons whose number is locally conserved . whether this mismatch between models and systems being modeled matters or not is bound to depend on the physical quantities to be computed .",
    "many calculations of thermodynamic and transport properties of fermionic superfluids have firmly established the phenomenological success of particle - number non - conserving mean - field theories .",
    "but these successes do not imply that every experimentally accessible feature of the fermionic superfluid state is well described by breaking particle - number conservation , see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will set up the ground for a systematic investigation of the interplay between the mean - field topological classification of superfluid systems of fermions and more realistic models where , for closed systems , the number of fermions is conserved .",
    "our discussion will be organized around three fundamental and interrelated questions .    * what makes a particle - number conserving fermionic superfluid / superconductor topologically trivial or non - trivial ? * what are the experimental signatures of fermionic topological superfluidity ? * what is the fate of majorana zero - energy modes beyond the mean - field approximation ? and even more basically , what is their very meaning ?",
    "concern with the role of particle ( non-)conservation in the mean - field theory of superconductivity is as old as the theory itself @xcite .",
    "we feel prompted to revisit this issue by the recent _ experimental _ efforts to detect and control majorana zero - energy modes .",
    "the presence of majorana modes has been typically considered a key mean - field manifestation of topological fermion superfluidity since the work of ref.@xcite .",
    "these quasi - particles emerge from the interplay between the existence of a topologically non - trivial vacuum and a , typically , symmetry - protected physical boundary ( or defect ) . in recent literature",
    ", this connection goes under the name of bulk - boundary correspondence . because of the expected resilience against decoherence and non - abelian braiding properties , majorana modes , or simply majorana fermions for short , are key components of many blueprints of quantum - information processing devices .",
    "given that either electrons or fermionic atoms are in fact locally conserved , it is imperative to investigate the conditions for the emergence of majorana fermions and procedures for their experimental detection beyond mean field .",
    "our work here suggests the idea that a majorana fermion may be quantum controlled is so deeply rooted in the mean - field picture that it might not have a natural counterpart in more realistic particle - number conserving frameworks .",
    "briefly stated , if a zero - energy mode of a superfluid system creates a superposition of states that differ in particle number / electric charge , it may not be possible to manipulate this mode without exchanging particles with an environment , as opposed to exchanging , say , energy only .",
    "then the question becomes whether it is possible in practice to exchange _ coherently _ ( charged ) particles with a reservoir big enough to grant the mean - field picture of the ( sub)system of interest .",
    "this claim is ultimately rooted in the venerable @xcite , but still much investigated and debated @xcite , subject of superselection rules .",
    "our last statement requires some clarification , since it takes for granted the existence of majorana modes for closed , hence necessarily particle - number conserving , systems . here",
    "we will investigate whether this assumption is reasonable based on our work published in ref.@xcite . by exploiting the algebraic bethe ansatz , we succeeded in establishing and characterizing topological superconductivity for prototypical particle number - conserving , and thus necessarily interacting , superconducting chains beyond mean - field theory . before this work",
    ", it was not known how to test for topological fermion superfluidity in number - conserving systems .",
    "the fact that a witness based on fermionic parity switches works in spite of the conservation of particle number can be firmly established thanks to the realization of an exactly - solvable topological fermion superfluid , the richardson - gaudin - kitaev ( rgk ) wire . moreover ,",
    "the rgk wire allows derivation of an exact topological invariant .",

    "we focus on the meaning and nature of majorana zero - energy modes in gapped , interacting many - electron systems .",
    "( one may compare to recent work based on a quasi - exactly solvable , particle - number conserving , two - leg ladder model of spinless fermions with open boundary conditions and a gapless excitation spectrum @xcite .",

    "we conclude in section [ outlook ] with an outlook .",
    "we now present a model , dubbed the rgk chain , introduced and solved in ref .",
    "the rgk chain is the first example of an interacting , particle - conserving , fermionic superfluid in one spatial dimension shown to display a topologically non - trivial superfluid phase .",
    "it was designed to benchmark possible criteria of topological superfluidity in number conserving systems .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rgk chain , in the momentum representation , is given by @xmath7 in terms of spinless ( or fully spin - polarized ) fermion creation operators @xmath8 , with momentum @xmath9-dependent single - particle spectrum @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes , and @xmath12 the attractive interaction strength .",

    "as we shall see in a moment , the long - range coupling allows as well for a topologically non - trivial phase .",
    "it may also be physically relevant for chains of magnetic nanoparticles on a superconducting substrate @xcite , which have recently been shown to support topologically protected majorana zero - modes in the presence of a long - range coupling @xcite .",
    "before we present the exact solution of the rgk chain , we would like to establish whether it displays a non - trivial topological phase in the mean - field approximation .",

    "the natural basis of this subspace would consist of the state with no bogoliubov quasi - particles ( the vacuum of the system ) and a second state obtained by applying a ( generalized ) majorana mode localized on either end of the chain to this vacuum .",
    "since these states differ in their fermionic parity , a symmetry that can not be explicitly broken , at least the degeneracy of this subspace is expected to be resilient to decoherence by the environment .",

    "hence , the setup seems good and ripe for quantum manipulation and control .",
    "what is it to be learned from incorporating particle - number conservation into the picture ?",
    "models like the rgk chain demonstrate the consistency between the requirements of topological non - triviality and a ground - state subspace with a basis that has a definite fermionic number ( as opposed to just definite fermionic parity ) : the vacuum has some fixed number of fermions , and the  topologically degenerate \" state has one more or less fermion .",
    "this result is encouraging since it shows that fermionic parity switches , as a criterion for topological fermion superfluidity , survive beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "but it also shows this :    there are however good reasons , and even mathematical proofs sometimes , for believing such coherent superpositions do not in fact represent physical states .",

    "let us rephrase these arguments in the context of the majorana modes of the rgk chain .",
    "two consecutive applications of the time - reversal operation @xmath219 should leave any physical ray unchanged . consider the coherent superpositions @xmath220 it implies that @xmath221 therefore , not leaving the ray @xmath222 invariant .",
    "consequently , the wick - wightman - wigner boson / fermion superselection rule @xcite , applied to the coherent superposition @xmath222 indicates that there is no physical observable that can measure the relative phase @xmath223 between the even ( bosonic ) and odd ( fermionic ) sectors .",
    "then , hermitian operators connecting those sectors , such as @xmath196 , are not measurable .",
    "since parity @xmath224 does not connect the even and odd sectors it could , in principle , be measurable .",
    "however , notice from eq . that parity @xmath224 requires preparation of the coherent superposition @xmath201 , eq . .",
    "in this paper we presented a criterion for characterizing interacting , particle - number conserving fermionic superfluids as topologically trivial or non - trivial @xcite .",
    "our criterion combines the many - body ground - state energies of systems with @xmath88 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 fermions , computed for both periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions , into an observable with the interpretation of an inverse compressibility that keeps track of switches in fermionic parity as the phase @xmath22 specifying twisted boundary conditions evolves from @xmath24 ( periodic boundary conditions ) to @xmath227 , passing through @xmath26 ( antiperiodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the behavior of this inverse compressibility in the thermodynamic limit dictates the topologically trivial or non - trivial character of the superfluid phase in question . the experimental signature , directly related to this test of topological non - triviality beyond mean - field ,",
    "is the @xmath1-periodic josephson effect.@xcite    realizing an exactly - solvable , particle - number conserving , minimal generalization of the majorana chain of kitaev has helped enormously to clarifying what is entailed by the notion of a topological superfluid beyond the mean - field approximation . in particular , because of its bethe ansatz solution , we were able to investigate our criterion for topological non - triviality very explicitly in the richardson - gaudin - kitaev ( rgk ) wire .",
    "notice that  minimal generalization \" implies that the number - conserving wire should be gapped inside the various superfluid phases .",
    "this explains why the pairing interaction in the rgk chain must be long - range , while the complete integrability condition merely tweaks the particular shape of this interaction . by the mermin - wagner ( or coleman in field theory ) theorem , compact ,",
    "continuous symmetries can not be spontaneously broken in one dimension , for systems with finite - range interactions .",
    "our rgk wire escapes this general result by violating this last condition , and so manages to display a true gap in the thermodynamic limit associated to the spontaneous , but not explicit as in mean - field approaches , breaking of particle - number conservation and the presence of long - range order .    on general grounds , one expects that fermionic parity switches should be affected by zero - energy modes of majorana character .",
    "stimulated by our findings we introduced in section [ ncmajoranas ] , and provided a physical meaning to , the concept of many - body majorana zero - energy modes .",
    "we believe we have managed to reasonably show that our zero - energy modes , beyond mean - field , should indeed be thought of as majorana modes .",
    "three are the reasons behind our claim .",
    "first , even though they emerge in a particle - number conserving system , our many - body majorana modes do not conserve particle number .",
    "second , they satisfy the majorana algebra and , perhaps even more importantly , they precisely anticommute with fermionic parity . and third , it is possible to argue , partly because they anticommute with fermionic parity , that our many - body majorana modes should evolve into the corresponding mean - field modes of section[mf ] .",
    "let us now discuss the issue of quantum manipulation and control of majorana modes .",
    "it is convenient to recall briefly the importance of the majorana chain from the viewpoint of quantum information processing .",
    "one could , in principle , encode a single qubit since the ground - state energy level is two - fold degenerate .",
    "however , this is not sufficient .",
    "what is important is that this subspace is resilient to errors characterized by quasi - local operators quadratic in fermions , and those errors preserve fermionic parity . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground - state degeneracy of the majorana chain with open boundaries is associated to the spontaneous breaking of fermionic parity . in general , knowing which symmetry is responsible for the degeneracy makes it simple to lift : just break the responsible symmetry explicitly . however",
    ", this is not simple for fermionic parity .",
    "quasi - local fermionic operators that fail to commute with fermionic parity , must also necessarily fail to commute with each other at long distances ( think for example of the creation and annihilation operators in real space , and products of three creation and annihilation operators , etc . ) .",
    "hence , because of the interplay between locality and fermionic statistics , it is not possible to break fermonic parity explicitly for a closed system .    as explained in section[ssr ] we believe that the traditional theory of superselection rules enforces restrictive constrains to the idea that zero - energy modes of fermion superfluids anticommuting with fermionic parity may be quantum manipulated .",
    "the problem in short is that fermionic parity is a superselected symmetry , for at least two reasons .",
    "first , there is the relations between fermionic parity and the square of the physical time - reversal operation .",
    "second , there is the relation between fermionic parity and electric charge , a quantity that is superselected due to gauss law @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the fact the fermionic parity is superselected in a closed system explains from a different point of view why it can not be explicitly broken .",
    "the traditional view on superselection rules has , however , been challenged from time to time .",
    "aharonov and susskind @xcite were the first to emphatically assert that there are no superselection rules in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "their argument , adapted to our particle - conserving topological fermion superfluid , requires the introduction of a _ suitable designed environment _ that couples to our system and acts as a reference system . in that way",
    ", they would claim that it is possible to measure the phase @xmath223 relative to that environment represented by a reference state .",
    "in other words , by suitably coupling our rgk wire to a reservoir that allows for interchange of fermions , simultaneously violating the conservation of fermionic parity , one could potentially generate a many - body majorana zero - energy mode .",
    "regardless , we would like to point out that it will be , _ at least _",
    ", extremely hard to achieve such a level of coherence experimentally in , for instance , solid state nanowires .",
    "the computational power of majorana braiding is rooted in its non - abelian , dynamically generated , properties that follow simply from its algebra and the existence of an excitation energy gap .",
    "we acknowledge illuminating discussions with tony leggett , manny knill , and babak seradjeh .",
    "9                        similar caution , focused on the uncritical use of the mean - field approximation , has been raised by tony leggett .",
    "see for instance : a. j. leggett in _ doing physics : a festschrift for thomas erber _ , pp .",
    "173 - 183 , ( iit press , chicago , 2011 ) ; see also a recent talk in http://people.physics.illinois.edu/leggett/mzm.pdf .",
    "the existence of an edge / boundary state or mode relies on the concept of localization .",
    "the latter depends on the algebraic language with respect to which the many - body state is assumed to be localized . in our particular case , majoranas should be localized with respect to the position label @xmath228 defining the edge . while in the case of non - interacting systems it is straightforward to define a _ single - particle _ edge / boundary state , it is not obvious how to define a _ many - body _ one .",
    "we next propose two totally equivalent ways to establishing the presence of a localized many - body edge / boundary state .    to realize a many - body ( zero - energy ) edge state it is necessary to have degenerate ( in energy ) states .",
    "suppose that we have two degenerate ground states @xmath229 and @xmath230 . the degeneracy may be exact in a finite system or it may become exact only in the thermodynamic limit . in the latter case ,",
    "it is necessary that the energy of the two states involved converges in some appropriate way with the system size @xmath21 .",
    "compute the reduced density matrices ( @xmath231 ) @xmath232=\\rho_\\alpha(j ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath233 is the partial trace over the complement of the set of position - localized subsystems @xmath234 .",
    "if @xmath235 where the equivalence refers to ( exponential or power - law ) convergence in @xmath228 , with maximum absolute value at the boundaries and decaying towards zero in the bulk , then there exists a localized state in each boundary in that particular , i.e. , position , language .",
    "an equivalent statement is that there exists a unitary operator @xmath236 acting only on sites @xmath237 and @xmath21 that connects the two degenerate ground states @xmath238"
