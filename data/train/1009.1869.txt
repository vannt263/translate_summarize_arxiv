    "extending the standard model  ( sm ) higgs sector to two higgs doublets , @xmath0 gives the two - higgs - doublet model  ( thdm ) .",
    "there , the potential may contain many more terms than in the sm ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the most general thdm higgs potential can be written  @xcite @xmath1 + [ \\lambda_6 ( \\varphi_1^\\dagger \\varphi_2 ) + \\lambda_6^ * ( \\varphi_2^\\dagger \\varphi_1 ) ] ( \\varphi_1^\\dagger \\varphi_1 ) + [ \\lambda_7 ( \\varphi_1^\\dagger \\varphi_2 ) + \\lambda_7^ * ( \\varphi_2^\\dagger \\varphi_1 ) ] ( \\varphi_2^\\dagger \\varphi_2)\\;,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 real and @xmath5 , @xmath6 complex .",
    "many properties of thdms turn out to have a simple geometric meaning if we introduce gauge invariant bilinears  @xcite , @xmath7 in terms of these bilinears @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the higgs potential   reads @xmath10 with parameters  @xmath11 , @xmath12 , 3-component vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 and a @xmath15 matrix @xmath16 , all real .",
    "the standard cp transformation of the higgs - doublet fields is defined by @xmath17 in terms of the bilinears , this standard cp  transformation is  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , corresponding in @xmath20  space to a reflection on the 13 plane . generalised cp transformations  ( gcps ) are by @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 an arbitrary unitary @xmath23 matrix . in terms of the bilinears",
    "this reads  @xcite @xmath24 with an improper rotation matrix  @xmath25 .    requiring @xmath26 leads to two types of gcps . in @xmath20",
    "space : @xmath27    while the cp transformations of type @xmath28 are equivalent to the standard cp transformation  , respectively  , the point reflection transformation of type @xmath29 is quite different and turns out to have very interesting properties . motivated by this geometric picture of generalised cp transformations , the most general thdm invariant under the point reflection  ( @xmath30 ) has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding potential has to obey the conditions @xmath31 , @xmath32 this model is , besides the point reflection symmetry of type @xmath29 , invariant under three gcps of type @xmath28 .",
    "we call this model therefore maximally cp symmetric model , mcpm . requiring also maximally cp symmetric yukawa couplings",
    "we find that at least two fermion families are necessary in order to have non - vanishing fermion masses .",
    "that is , we find a reason for family replication in the mcpm .",
    "furthermore , requiring absence of large flavor changing neutral currents it was shown that the yukawa couplings are completely fixed .",
    "for instance for the lepton sector we get the yukawa couplings @xmath33 in the unitary gauge electroweak symmetry breaking gives @xmath34 with the standard vacuum - expectation value .",
    "the physical higgs - boson fields are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "let us briefly summarize the essential properties of the mcpm :    * there are 5 physical higgs particles , two cp even ones @xmath35 , @xmath36 , one cp odd one @xmath37 , and a charged higgs - boson pair  @xmath38 . * the @xmath35 boson couples exclusively to the third @xmath39  family , @xmath35 behaves like the sm higgs boson . * the higgs bosons @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 couple exclusively to the second @xmath40  family with strengths proportional to the masses of the third generation fermions .",
    "* the first @xmath41  family is uncoupled to the higgs bosons .    for further details we refer to  @xcite .",
    "since the yukawa couplings of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 higgs bosons to the second fermion family are proportional to the third - fermion - family masses we have large cross sections for drell  yan type higgs - boson production . for the same reason we have large decay rates of these higgs bosons to the second generation fermions . in figure  [ fig - diag ]",
    "we show the diagrams for these production and decay reactions in @xmath42  collisions .            in  @xcite",
    "the cross sections were computed for drell - yan higgs - boson production at the tevatron and the lhc for center - of - mass energies of 1.96  tev and 14  tev , respectively . in  @xcite radiative effects were considered . here",
    "we add the cross sections for a center - of - mass energy of  7  tev at lhc , which is currently available .",
    "the corresponding total cross sections for the drell  yan production of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 bosons are shown in figure  [ figs ] . in this figure",
    "we also recall the branching ratios of the @xmath37 boson decays .",
    "left : total cross section of drell  yan type higgs boson production at tevatron and lhc .",
    "right : branching ratios of the cp odd @xmath37 higgs boson , where a mass of @xmath44  gev is assumed.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   left : total cross section of drell  yan type higgs boson production at tevatron and lhc .",
    "right : branching ratios of the cp odd @xmath37 higgs boson , where a mass of @xmath44  gev is assumed.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as an example consider higgs - boson masses @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 of 200  gev where we get very large total production cross sections , around 850  pb , for lhc7 . these higgs bosons decay mainly into light @xmath45 and @xmath46 quarks .",
    "however , tagging of @xmath45 and @xmath46-quarks in the detectors is at least challenging .",
    "channels involving muons should be more easily accessible experimentally . with the branching ratio of @xmath47 into @xmath48-pairs , we predict about 25 @xmath48 events from a 200  gev @xmath36  ( @xmath37 ) at lhc7  for  1  fb@xmath49 integrated luminosity . for further details of the calculations we refer to  @xcite .",
