    "the problem of structure formation in the universe has probably been one of the foremost and most studied question in cosmology .",
    "perhaps the greatest achievement of cosmology was the prediction and following discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation ",
    "the cmbr ( penzias & wilson , 1965 ) and its anisotropy ( smoot et al . 1992 ) .",
    "not only did it provide support for the big bang theory , it proved that structure is a result of small fluctuations growing into large inhomogeneities and not vice versa .",
    "the fact that the observed fluctuations in the cmbr are small ( @xmath0 ) , naively implies that one can treat the fluctuation within the linear approximation when modeling the evolution of structure before the time of last photon scattering , i.e. , one can assume that fluctuation modes of different wavelengths are completely decoupled from each other before radiation - matter decoupling .",
    "the first to develop a linear theory for the perturbed fridmann - robertson - walker metric was lifshitz ( 1946 ) , and it can be found in various text books such as weinberg ( 1972 ) , peebles ( 1980 ) and kolb & turner ( 1990 ) .",
    "the theory has since then been applied to describe cosmologies with various components and various initial parameters .",
    "baryonic matter , radiation and other massless particles , cold ( massive ) or hot ( light ) dark matter are some of the ingredients that enter the primordial soup . while other parameters such as the hubble constant @xmath1 , the vacuum energy through the cosmological constant @xmath2 , and the initial spectrum affect the evolution . a review of various current cosmological models",
    ", their evolution and implication can for example be found in white et al .",
    "( 1994 ) with emphasis on the microwave background radiation and in primack ( 1997 ) .",
    "less current reviews that cover the basic principles of structure formation are found in the aforementioned textbooks .",
    "one of the major parameters that affect the qualitative behaviour of our universe and is highly relevant to the present paper , is the type and form of the primordial spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations are generally classified into curvature ( or adiabatic ) and isocurvature ( or isothermal ) fluctuations .",
    "the first arise naturally in inflationary scenarios ( e.g. , liddle and lyth , 1993 , and ref . therein ) .",
    "they are fluctuations of both the baryonic fluid and the radiation and they propagate at the adiabatic speed of sound that is equal to @xmath3 if the radiation energy density dominates .",
    "these waves are found to decay on scales smaller than the silk scale , namely , scales comparable to galaxy sized objects ( silk , 1967 ) .",
    "therefore , a top - down structure formation is a natural consequence of adiabatic perturbations .",
    "small scale objects can form after recombination ( and initiate a bottom - up scenario ) only if one adds the undamped perturbation of a cold component as is the case in the standard cdm model ( peebles 1982 , blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 and davis et al . 1985 ) and its variants .",
    "isocurvature ( or isothermal ) fluctuations on the other hand , are a natural consequence of topological defects formed in phase transitions ( e.g , strings , monopoles and textures ) or if more than one field contributes significantly to the energy density during inflation .",
    "they correspond to fluctuations that alter the entropy density but not the energy density .",
    "unlike the first type of fluctuations , these do not suffer from silk damping .",
    "consequently , objects with a mass as small the post - recombination jeans scale , namely the size of globular clusters , can form after decoupling .",
    "it is interesting and important to note that even if the primordial spectrum was purely adiabatic , isothermal perturbations of a given wavelength are formed as the second order effect of purcell clustering from adiabatic waves of similar wavelengths ( press & vishniac , 1979 ) . through this effect ,",
    "noninteracting particles ( baryons ) that are viscously coupled to a stochastically oscillating background gas ( radiation fluid ) undergo secular clustering .",
    "originally , it was thought that the effect can produce a bottom - up scenario even from a pure baryon model with an adiabatic spectrum .",
    "however , the typical post - recombination jeans scale amplitude of the isothermal waves will only be @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the typical adiabatic fluctuations at horizon crossing .",
    "namely , if the primordial spectrum is flat and adiabatic , the typical isothermal fluctuation at recombination is roughly @xmath6 . for a flat isothermal primordial spectrum , one should expect typical amplitudes of @xmath7 .",
    "the smallness of nonlinear effects such as the purcell clustering ( or shock waves which are of an even higher order ) led to the consensus that the evolution of the fluctuations can be treated linearly and modes of different wavelengths are decoupled from each other .",
    "this delays the nonlinear treatment to the time when radiation does not play any dynamic role anymore . at face value",
    ", it certainly appears to be the case as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are all much smaller than unity .",
    "one should nevertheless be extremely careful when assuming linearity , especially in view of the fact that not all of the dimensionless parameters are actually smaller than unity .",
    "one of the dimensionless numbers that appears in the solution of the nonlinear fluctuations equations of motion and that is not small at all is the root of the radiation to gas pressure ratio .",
    "just before recombination one finds that @xmath11 !",
    "consequently , we expect that the interaction between the radiation and matter at this period will have profound impact on the evolution of the fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we examine the linear hypothesis and its validity by adding the force large scale perturbations exert on short wavelength waves .",
    "we begin in  2 by overviewing the problem of solving the nonlinear equations of motion and estimating the effect with a very simple analysis .",
    "we proceed in  3 to write the newtonian equations describing the evolution of short wavelength isothermal modes . in ",
    "4 we analyse the simplified solution , while in  5 we proceed to estimate the effect in a few cosmological scenarios . in  6 &  7 , we study the possible ramifications to structure formation and study the possibility of measuring and using this effect in the study of cosmological parameters . in  8",
    "we show that the effect can influence large scale structure as well .",
    "at the lowest order of approximation , waves of different wavelengths are decoupled from each other .",
    "this suggests that a small scale isothermal wave will , at this order , witness an isotropic and homogeneous medium around it .",
    "however , at the next order of approximation , one has to include the small perturbations ( of order @xmath12 ) of all the other scales in the vicinity of the isothermal wave .",
    "one can simplify the problem by assuming that the isothermal wave is localised to a region of size @xmath13 that is at least several times the wave s wavelength ( such that the wave parameters are well defined ) .",
    "the scale @xmath13 separates between two types of perturbations : those with a wavelength @xmath14 and those with @xmath15 .",
    "the contribution for example to the radiative force of the former group vanishes in the lowest order as the spatial correlation between the wave and perturbation yields a net vanishing result .",
    "the latter group can contribute a net effect only if the temporal correlation between the perturbation and the isothermal wave does not vanish as well ; namely , it will do so only if the perturbation does not have enough time to oscillate rapidly inside the region under consideration .",
    "this implies that for a given period @xmath16 , the contribution of waves with @xmath17 averages out leaving no net contribution .",
    "the only waves that have a net contribution are those for which @xmath18 ; that is , if @xmath13 is chosen smaller than the wavelengths of waves with @xmath19 , its exact value is unimportant .",
    "hence , we solve for short wavelength isothermal waves in a region where the long wavelength perturbations can be considered constant and homogeneous . we can not however , assume that the local environment is isotropic .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the large scale perturbations are optically thick adiabatic waves of the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the perturbation of the matter density .",
    "it is proportional to the temperature perturbations : @xmath22 namely , the fluctuations in the radiation field and in the matter are synchronised .",
    "the sole force responsible for accelerating the matter is the radiative force .",
    "if observed from the baryon rest frame , the force is due to a net radiative flux originating from an anisotropy in the radiation field .",
    "this anisotropy or shear between the radiation and matter fluids can be found through the baryon acceleration .    using the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath23 to relate @xmath24 with @xmath25 and the continuity equation to relate @xmath26 with @xmath27 ,",
    "the velocity of the baryonic fluid in the adiabatic wave is found to be : @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a unit bector in @xmath30 s direction .",
    "the acceleration or the force per unit mass is simply @xmath31 , consequently , if the opacity per unit mass is @xmath32 , the net radiative flux @xmath33 is given by : @xmath34    the form for an isothermal wave travelling in a small region perturbed by the wave above is : @xmath35 with @xmath36 as it is isothermal .",
    "it will witness a constant radiative flux @xmath37 given by eq .",
    "[ eq_4 ] as it is optically thin .",
    "however , if @xmath32 is a function of density , the opacity and therefore the force per unit mass , become a function of the wave s phase . the predominant source of opacity before and during recombination",
    "is thomson scattering off the free electrons .",
    "consequently , the only period during which isothermal waves vary the opacity is during recombination , when the number of free electrons is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the total acceleration is : @xmath39 the first term results with the large scale acceleration already accounted for in the large scale fluctuation .",
    "the second term however , incites a force that varies synchronously with the small scale isothermal waves .",
    "it leads to an instability .",
    "the total power input per unit mass by the latter term into the wave is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a unit vector in @xmath42 s direction and @xmath43 is the angle between @xmath41 and @xmath29 .",
    "again , we related @xmath44 to @xmath45 through the continuity equation and the isothermal speed of sound @xmath46 .",
    "when averaging the force over time one has to recall that the large scale perturbations are assumed not to vary over the relevant period - the duration of recombination .",
    "now we see why .",
    "oscillating large scale perturbations will average to a zero net contribution .",
    "those that oscillate on a longer time scale can be assumed constant : @xmath47 using @xmath48 to average the isothermal oscillations , we find : @xmath49 the total energy per unit mass in the acoustic wave is @xmath50 the @xmath51-fold growth rate of the wave s amplitude is therefore : @xmath52 let the duration of recombination be @xmath16 .",
    "the growth factor g , or the number of @xmath51-folds the wave will grow if traveling in the direction of the large scale shear ( i.e. , if @xmath53 ) , is : @xmath54 where we have inserted the ratio of the speeds of sound at recombination assuming radiation dominance over baryonic matter .",
    "we have also taken @xmath55 , as waves with a larger @xmath56 average out .",
    "@xmath57 is a constant of order unity which can not be found in this approximate estimate .",
    "@xmath58 at recombination will have a distribution of values .",
    "if however , the typical value is of order @xmath59 , then the typical growth rate is @xmath57 @xmath51-folds .",
    "namely , we expect that the nonlinear effect is at least as important as the linear evolution of the isothermal wave .",
    "it is now also evident why isothermal waves are unstable while adiabatic are mostly stable .",
    "one only has to replace @xmath46 by @xmath23 to find that the adiabatic waves are unstable only for @xmath60 of order unity and not much less .",
    "[ g_simp ] is useful as an estimate , but a more general expression for the growth parameter @xmath61 should not include an assumption on the type , speed , or optical depth of the large scale waves , but instead use directly the radiation flux observed in the baryon rest frame . by using eq .",
    "[ h_k_eq ] and letting @xmath62 vary during recombination , we have : @xmath63 note that @xmath33 is the flux observed in the baryon rest frame .",
    "the general nonlinear relativistic equations describing the evolution of the perturbations are extremely difficult , if not impossible , to be solved analytically .",
    "we therefore simplify the problem until it becomes amenable to an analytical treatment without losing the basic physical ingredients .",
    "it is generally not possible to decouple the system into different wavelengths and solve each one separately . nonetheless ,",
    "if the nonlinearity is small , namely , the interaction between modes of different wavelengths is small , we can write the equations describing each mode as decoupled equations to which a coupling correction is added . moreover , we have seen in  2 that the coupling is essentially an effect large modes ( adiabatic or isothermal ) have on small isothermal waves .",
    "that is , the large horizon sized modes are largely unaffected and can be integrated as uncoupled modes , whereas the small modes are mostly affected only by the large modes and not by themselves .",
    "consequently , the short wavelengths modes can be solved independently as the equation for each one is the basic uncoupled linear equation to which a linear source term is added .",
    "this term depends only on the history of the long wavelengths modes .",
    "actually , this statement is true only as long as the amount of energy transferred into the short wavelengths is negligible when compared to the energy in the larger scale .",
    "this will be further discussed in  8 .",
    "to summarise , the assumptions made in order to simplify the equations are :    * the short wavelength fluctuations are pure isothermal waves - i.e. , there are no perturbations to the radiation field .",
    "* the fluctuations are of a wavelength much smaller than the horizon size and are therefore solved under the newtonian approximation . *",
    "the short wavelength fluctuations are affected only by large wavelength modes . *",
    "the evolution of the large wavelength modes is decoupled and is assumed to have been solved a priori . *",
    "the short wavelength modes are solved in localised regions where the effect of the large scales can be considered as homogeneous .    the system solved is described in figure [ system_figure ] .",
    "we start by writing the equations of motion describing newtonian _",
    "isothermal _ fluctuations .",
    "the simplest equations describing matter fluctuations of scales much smaller than the horizon size and velocities much smaller than the speed of light are the newtonian equations of motion , corrected to include the expansion of the universe .",
    "these are ( see for example kolb & turner 1990 ) : @xmath64 where the various quantities have their usual meaning . here",
    "@xmath65 is the isothermal speed of sound .",
    "the last term in the second equation is the force per unit mass acting on the baryonic fluid .",
    "it can be expressed with the help of the flux @xmath37 observed in the baryonic rest frame and the opacity per unit mass @xmath32 .",
    "it can also be expressed with the radiation `` velocity '' @xmath66  the velocity with which the baryons need to move in order for them not to observe a net radiation flow , and a characteristic time @xmath67 for the transfer of momentum between the electron - proton fluid and the photons . if the angular dependence of the photon energy density distribution @xmath68 is expanded into legendre polynomials",
    ": @xmath69 then the radiation `` velocity '' is given by @xmath70 and the flux observed in the baryon rest frame is @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the material velocity .",
    "either way , the total radiative force per unit mass @xmath73 can be written as : @xmath74 we will work with the latter expression that uses the effective velocity of the radiation fluid @xmath75 as it is easier to work with when coupling the baryons to the radiation .",
    "for nonrelativistic velocities and thomson scattering , the term can be written as : @xmath76 @xmath77 is the number of free electrons , @xmath78 denotes the radiation density constant , and @xmath79 is the thomson cross section .",
    "normally when linearised and fourier transformed , this term which describes the radiation drag has a contribution only from the wave for which the linearized equations of motion are written .",
    "however , the contribution of waves of all scales should be taken into account if through the nonlinear interaction they produce a correction synchronised with the waves . when linearising , we find the following terms : @xmath80 the first term is responsible for the radiation drag due to the difference between the wave s material velocity and the radiation `` velocity '' .",
    "the second term is due to the nonlinear effect that all other waves induce on this particular one through the change in the medium s opacity _ and _ the shear between the material velocity and the effective radiation velocity of all other waves .",
    "the value of the large scale shear @xmath81 is the value at the region in which the small scale wave is solved for .",
    "the latter contribution is synchronised with the wave through the changes in the opacity .",
    "it is of second order and it should be integrated over time .",
    "clearly , the contribution of waves oscillating at frequencies different than the particular wave averages to zero , thus , the only net contribution arise from waves that do not oscillate over the relevant integration time ; that is to say , only the shear of the large scale waves contributes . if a wave oscillates @xmath82-times during the period , its net contribution will on average fall as @xmath83 .",
    "when integrated numerically in  5 , the contribution of smaller scales is taken into account automatically and their contribution indeed falls with @xmath56 .",
    "the radiation field is not perturbed for optically thin , isothermal fluctuations .",
    "consequently , @xmath84 vanishes .",
    "if we define the large scale shear as : @xmath85 and write @xmath86 then the radiation term is : @xmath87 the second term does not vanish if the opacity is perturbed by the isothermal waves . by definition , the temperature is nt perturbed and @xmath88 .",
    "if however the opacity is a function of the density , then @xmath89 and a new term is added to the newtonian equations of motion .",
    "the opacity is predominantly thomson scattering , consequently , @xmath90 is proportional to the number of free electrons .",
    "the number of free electrons varies only during recombination . at this time @xmath77",
    "is inversely proportional to the root of the density . to be more exact , the fraction of ionised protons at equilibrium @xmath91 is given by saha s equation : @xmath92 with the baryon to photon ratio @xmath93 being proportional to the density and @xmath94 the ionisation energy of hydrogen .",
    "through differentiation we find : @xmath95 that is , before recombination commences , @xmath91 is approximately unity and the parameter @xmath96 vanishes .",
    "afterwards it will grow in size and reach the asymptotic value of @xmath97 .",
    "note that for the above equation to be valid , we need to assume that the time scale for ionisation equilibrium ( @xmath98 ) is shorter than the dynamic time scale .",
    "this implies that among other assumptions , the equations are valid only before freeze - in which takes place not too long after the advent of recombination .",
    "we have also neglected helium ionisation and its influence on the density dependence of the opacity .",
    "however , the low abundance of helium results with a much smaller effective @xmath96 , and together with the larger speed of sound , they both reduce the effect during the period of helium recombination .    define @xmath99 and spatially expand @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 in fourier integrals proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "the result is : @xmath104 the new phenomena discussed here arise from the introduction of the last term in the second equation .",
    "the term is proportional to the density perturbations ( through opacity changes ) and to the integrated large scale shear @xmath105 which varies in space .",
    "even with the additional radiation term , the irrotational flow is still decoupled from the rotational part . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotational part is affected from the irrotational one .",
    "this interesting effect can introduce a seed magnetic field from any isothermal fluctuation present , as is described in shaviv & levin ( 1998 ) .    by taking the irrotational part of the second equation ( through the dot product with @xmath106 ) , and using the first and last equations , we find that @xmath107 obeys the equation :    @xmath108 @xmath109    this equation ( and its derivation )",
    "should be compared with the standard derivation of the equations describing isothermal waves when all nonlinear interactions are neglected ( e.g. , coles and lucchin , 1995 ) .",
    "the solution of the linear equation consists of two modes .",
    "one describes a highly damped wave with a damping time scale of @xmath110 . the other describes a frozen mode .",
    "although the latter is formally unstable , the large radiation drag effectively reduces the growth rate to a value much smaller than the universe expansion rate .",
    "the general solution to eq .",
    "[ simpeq ] depends on the exact time dependence of @xmath78 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath105 & @xmath67 .",
    "we are however , interested in the evolution over the short period of decoupling , a period that is much smaller than the age of the universe at the time .",
    "moreover , we are particularly interested in circumstances were the growth rates are large , in fact , larger than the rate in which the various parameters change during recombination .",
    "this will allow us to assume that the above variables are quasi - static .",
    "the system described by eq .",
    "[ simpeq ] has five different time scales of which some depend on the wave number .",
    "the first two are the expansion age of the universe and the related jeans timescale . for a flat matter dominated universe ,",
    "the first is : @xmath113 while the second is : @xmath114 the last equivalence assumed a flat matter dominated universe .",
    "the third timescale is the isothermal oscillation time : @xmath115 the fourth is the electron - photon relaxation time @xmath67 that describes how fast baryon and radiation exchange energy .",
    "the newly introduced timescale is the time associated with the radiation inhomogeneity : @xmath116    we will assume here that the electron - photon relaxation time is much smaller than the universe s expansion time scale .",
    "the reason being that when the timescale surpasses the expansion scale , the solution is in any case invalid because the timescale for establishing ionisation equilibrium becomes very long .",
    "the @xmath117 term can therefore be neglected .",
    "the time scales themselves depend on the cosmic time as well , however , since we are interested in timescales shorter than both the expansion of the universe and the timescale for recombination of hydrogen , we can for simplicity assume them to be constant or quasi - stationary .",
    "in such a case , the equation s solution is exponential with the roots : @xmath118 the waves growth rate is given by the real part of @xmath119 , namely @xmath120 .",
    "it will be governed by the largest rate ( or smallest time scale ) in the system .",
    "the oscillatory behaviour is given by the imaginary part  @xmath121 .",
    "for an optically thick universe with @xmath122 , we find two general cases .",
    "the two cases and their various regions of @xmath123 in which the rates behave differently , are summarised in table [ cases_table ] and exemplified in figure [ rer_figure ] where a few sample graphs of @xmath124 are shown .     &",

    "[ roots ] , one finds that it admits two general forms of behaviour depending on whether @xmath105 is smaller or larger than @xmath125 .",
    "the main difference between the two cases is that large @xmath123 waves in the former case are damped while in the latter they are unstable and amplify .",
    "more specifically , one has :    * case a : @xmath126 * + when the shear velocity between the radiation and baryon fluid is smaller than the critical value , the shear can not overcome the radiation drag .",
    "even though the quantitative analysis may change , the general behaviour is the one found when the shear velocity is altogether neglected . that is to say , long wavelengths for which @xmath127 are frozen in the plasma . although they do have a positive growth rate , it is small when compared with the growth rate of the horizon",
    ". waves with smaller wavelengths for which @xmath128 are damped , and when @xmath129 , the damping rate is saturated at its asymptotic value of @xmath130 .",
    "* case b : @xmath131 * + the behaviour of the system is radically different when the large scale shear velocity is larger than the critical value . at large wavelengths , the waves are still frozen in and the behaviour is the same as in the previous case .",
    "on the other hand , at shorter wavelengths the waves growth rate is dominated by @xmath132 .",
    "instead of being damped or frozen - in , the waves can in this case be unstable .",
    "the growth rate of waves propagating in the direction of the shear increases with @xmath123 and it saturates at small wavelengths when acoustic oscillations become important .",
    "the maximum or asymptotic growth rate is obtained for values of @xmath123 larger than : @xmath133 i.e. , for scales smaller than the jeans scale by a factor of order @xmath134 .",
    "the typical values of @xmath135 when the rate is large are of order 10 , implying that the typical scales would be 10 times smaller than the jeans scale . the maximum growth rate is then given by : @xmath136 it is now evident why isothermal waves are crucial .",
    "the speed of sound @xmath137 in isothermal waves is much smaller than the speed of light , therefore , the typical shears that cause nonlinear interactions are of order @xmath138 and not @xmath139 ! an appreciable nonlinear effect can take place already at a dimensionless amplitude of @xmath140 or @xmath59 !",
    "we are interested in the integrated effect of the growth rate in the time interval between a given @xmath141 and a given later time @xmath142 .",
    "hence , we define the following growth parameter : @xmath143 if the rate given by eq .  [ max_growth ] is larger than all other inverse timescales of the system on which the value of the rate can change ( i.e. , both the expansion and the recombination timescales ) then the growth factor of the isothermal waves",
    "is approximately given by : @xmath144 the recombination time @xmath145 is the shortest timescale on which the growth rate changes . as a consequence , the condition for the approximation to hold can be written as @xmath146 , and it can be translated through eq .",
    "[ growthint ] to @xmath147 .",
    "we proceed to investigate the rate of growth in two ways :    * the nonlinear growth rate equation ( eq .  [ growth_eq ] ) is averaged over the distribution of perturbation amplitudes and direction of motion in order to get the average growth of the amplitude of the waves .",
    "* we explore systems that reach nonlinear amplitudes by examining the volume fraction that does develop nonlinearities and the possible effects triggered by these nonlinear regions .",
    "we now proceed to estimate the _ average _ growth of amplitude of small scale waves for which @xmath148 .",
    "although the physical scale is small enough not to be _ directly _ detectable in the near future , these modes have the fastest growth rate and are therefore most interesting .    the averaging procedure of the amplification described by equation [ growth_eq ]",
    "should be divided into two separate averages over two distributions .",
    "first , the expression should be averaged over the various possible propagation directions since unlike the nonlinear case , the dispersion relation is now a function of the direction of @xmath106 ( with respect to the direction of the large scale shear ) and not only its absolute value .",
    "second , the growth function is found for a given local value of the shear , however , it is certainly not linear in its amplitude and one should therefore average over the distribution of large scale shears .",
    "we first average expression [ growth_eq ] over the @xmath149 possible directions of @xmath150 ( the direction of @xmath106 ) while keeping in mind that @xmath61 is linearly proportional @xmath151 .",
    "we get : @xmath152 @xmath153 with @xmath154 , i.e. , its maximum value .",
    "next , we proceed to average over the distribution of shears @xmath155 .",
    "this distribution will clearly depend on the form of the density distribution .",
    "the natural choice for the latter is a gaussian distribution .",
    "although it does not necessarily have to be the case , it is the theoretically most reasonable distribution expected for the density fluctuations .",
    "the distribution of the absolute value of the shears is similar in form to the distribution of the absolute velocities calculated from density perturbations in large scale structure ( e.g. coles and lucchin  18.3 ) , that is , if the distribution for the density fluctuations is gaussian then it will be guassian for the components of the shear vector in each axis , and the distribution for the absolute value will be given by a maxwellian distribution . if the root mean square of @xmath156 is @xmath157 , the distribution itself is : @xmath158 .",

    "moreover , the numerical values obtained , such as a 10% increase for @xmath163 , are only approximate since the required condition @xmath147 for the validity of eq .",
    "[ growth_eq ] is not fulfilled .",
    "nonetheless , already at @xmath164 , small scale isothermal fluctuations will amplify by almost 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "they will grow by 5 orders of magnitude for @xmath165 and for @xmath166 the growth will be a staggering 10 orders of magnitude . note that if the growth is saturated when the amplitude reaches nonlinearity then the average growth is meaningful only if the amplified amplitude is less than unity .",
    "moreover , unlike the case when @xmath167 , the solution here is much more accurate because regions that contribute the most to the growth are those in the high @xmath168 tail , where the approximate solution is valid .",
    "for example , the average growth when @xmath165 is of 5 orders of magnitude and the main contribution originates from @xmath169 .    also worth mentioning",
    "is that in the averaging procedure over the fluctuation distribution , we are essentially averaging an exponential function @xmath170 ; thus , if the distribution for the amplitudes does not fall fast enough for large values of @xmath168 ( which is proportional to @xmath171 ) , the averaging integral diverges .",
    "such a divergence occurs if the high @xmath171 tail is for example a power law .",
    "the implication is that there will always be a finite volume ( i.e. , volumes that are not exponentially small ) where nonlinearity can be reached if the distribution has a wide tail .",
    "a wide tail can in this case be any distribution with a power law tail or even a distribution with an exponential tail , provided the tail of the distribution is in the form @xmath172 with @xmath173 .",
    "the large exponential growth associated with small regions where the shear is large , is of high importance . in these regions that are small for a modest value for @xmath157",
    ", the growth may be large enough as to amplify waves out of the linear regime and let the nonlinear evolution of these wave commence .",
    "consequently , it is interesting to estimate what fraction of space will actually be filled with nonlinear waves by the end of recombination .",
    "the largest growth factor in a given region is given by @xmath174 .",
    "thus , if the typical small scale fluctuation amplitude before amplification is initially @xmath175 , then only if @xmath176 will there be waves that grow out of linearity , i.e. , only if @xmath177 .",
    "if the density fluctuations are gaussian , the distribution of growth factors @xmath168 is maxwellian and given by eq .",

    "the function @xmath180 is plotted in figure [ saturfunc ] . as an example , for @xmath181 , @xmath175 should be roughly @xmath59 to have 1% _ of the volume _ reach nonlinearity .",
    "if we could observationally detect all the regions in the background microwave sky that reach nonlinearity ( see e.g.  5 ) then the absolute number of regions showing nonlinearity will be given by the fraction that does develop it multiplied by the total number of statistically independent regions .",
    "the latter number is roughly @xmath182 with @xmath183 the multipole order corresponding to the typical shear producing wavelengths . by taking a co - moving @xmath184 as the typical correlation length for the shear producing zones",
    "( see e.g.  5 or fig .",

    "if the primordial spectrum of fluctuations is isothermal and flat , and the expectation for @xmath175 is @xmath189 then for any @xmath190 one should in future be able to detect the effect . for @xmath191",
    "more than 50% of the universe reaches nonlinearity at @xmath192 . in the case where the isothermal wave amplitude has the smallest plausible value , namely when the primordial spectrum is flat and adiabatic and the press - vishniac ( 1979 ) effect produces isothermal waves with an amplitude @xmath193 , the effect will be detectable for any @xmath194",
    "the largest attainable growth parameter is roughly : @xmath195 where @xmath16 is the approximate duration of decoupling .",
    "@xmath137 is the isothermal sound speed which at recombination is about 4.8 orders of magnitude less than the speed of light .",
    "therefore , when recombination commences and @xmath196 ( for an approximate duration of @xmath197 ) , the shear velocity should be about @xmath198 to get a 2 order of magnitude increase and @xmath199 to get as much as a 10 orders of magnitude increase .",
    "as recombination continues , the shear increases while @xmath200 and the optical depth decrease roughly by the same factor , such that the rate of growth is effectively unchanged during this period , even though the opacity changes by more than two orders of magnitude .    the interesting question that will ultimately determine the fate of the small scale fluctuations is therefore a quantitative one  what is the exact value ( i.e. the exact r.m.s . ) of the shear exerted by large scales and what is the integrated rate equal to ?    to answer the quantitative question , a numerical simulation for the behaviour of the large scale modes was carried out .",
    "the numerical code is a modification of the cosmics code developed by bertschinger and ma .",

    "if this process did in fact take place early in our universe , could it have left a mark on the cmbr that is detectable today ? and third , could the process have had other implications on structure formation in the early universe ?",
    "it is difficult to precisely estimate when the growth saturates .",
    "the simplest estimate to when the growth process ceases is as the wave reaches the nonlinear regime , a point at which our linear treatment breaks down anyway .",
    "clearly , when @xmath223 is of order unity , the different speeds of sound at different parts of the wave can create shocks that will dissipate the waves acoustic energy into thermal energy .",
    "when @xmath224 , the acoustic energy of isothermal waves is of order the thermal energy of the gas alone ( in adiabatic waves the energy is of order the thermal energy of the gas and radiation ) . at the time of recombination ,",
    "the heat capacity is very large because a large amount of energy is needed to reionise the hydrogen .",
    "thus , after recombination , when the temperature is of order but less than the recombination temperature @xmath225 , injecting an amount of order the thermal energy of the plasma will ionise at most only @xmath226 of the hydrogen atoms .",

    "if indeed this is the case , it will be proven as the origin for small scale structure , and it could be used for setting strict limits on cosmological parameters .",
    "more exotic possibilities for the fate of the nonlinear regions rely on the fact that the sub - jeans sized objects formed through the radiative instability during recombination can later on gravitationally collapse .",
    "the typical wave numbers that experience the large amplification are those with a wavelength larger than the jeans scale by at least an order of magnitude .",

    "compact objects of order of the jeans scale can therefore form and collapse at very high redshifts @xmath242 .",
    "what will the fate of these objects be ?",
    "they might collapse into massive black holes , they can also burn and release a few@xmath243 of their energy while doing so ( bond et al .",
    "these nonlinearities may perhaps form globular cluster like clusters or maybe even seeds for agn engines .",
    "another possibility is that the nonlinear objects form structure on larger scales through the large energy they release and a chain reaction of explosions that they ignite ( ostriker & cowie , 1981 ) , they can then prompt the collapse of galaxies in the expanding shells and form voids .",
    "although the peculiar velocity and the @xmath227-distortion prediced for the simplest of these models are both too high ( levin , freese & spergel , 1992 ) , the inclusion of continuous or multi - cycled detonation waves in the explosion model can lead to large voids with a diameter larger than 10 mpc , a peculiar velocity of roughly @xmath244 and a @xmath227-distortion less than the limit set by cobe ( miranda & opher , 1997 ) . if these explosions can indeed be ignited , only a very small fraction of the universe needs to reach the nonlinear regime by the end of recombination in order to have dramatic effects on the formation of large scale structure .",
    "the next question to address is whether the effect can also affect the large scales .",
    "since energy is conserved , large scales will be affected if the energy transferred to the smaller scales is comparable to the original energy in the large scales .",
    "the energy per unit mass in the large scale waves is roughly given by @xmath245 while the energy per unit mass in the small scale isothermal waves is roughly @xmath246 .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "[ eq_14 ] reveals that when the small isothermal waves have a dimensionless amplitude of order unity over a large fraction of the universe and @xmath247 , the energy content in both types of waves is comparable .",
    "a significant fraction of the energy in the large scales can therefore be transferred to the small scales .",
    "apparently , an exact treatment is beyond the scope of the linear analysis developed here and the unknown nonlinear physics can at most be phenomenalised using few parameters and a simple demonstrative model .    using the terminology and approximations of  2",
    ", one can express the original energy per unit mass in the large scales as @xmath248 . under the approximation of  2",
    ", we have @xmath249 , however , for optically thin large scale waves the energy in the waves is different and @xmath250 can change .",
    "the energy in the isothermal waves is @xmath251 and the energy growth rate is @xmath252 .",
    "next , we assume the energy damping rate of the small scale waves to be of the form : @xmath253 @xmath16 is the duration of recombination . @xmath254 and @xmath255 are parameters that represent the unknown physics .",
    "both parameters can depend on the wavelength of the unstable isothermal waves .",
    "@xmath254 should be of order unity for waves with a period of @xmath256 , but otherwise unknown .",
    "the power @xmath255 with which the damping depends on the amplitude of the isothermal wave is also unknown but should satisfy @xmath257 if it is characterised with only one power index and if it is to be more important on the nonlinear scales than on the linear ones .",
    "if the value of @xmath157 before the instability commences is large enough then a large fraction of the volume leaves the nonlinear regime .",
    "the critical value for this to take place is @xmath258 the simplest simplifying assumption is that the isothermal waves will saturate at a level where the energy growth rate is equal to the dissipation rate . the small scale amplitude @xmath259",
    "will then be given by @xmath260 compare now the energy in the large scales with the total energy that can be dissipated . when the latter energy is larger , all the energy in the large scales can be dissipated .",
    "the condition for it to take place is : @xmath261 when @xmath262 , an initial value of @xmath157 that satisfies the above condition will imply that the amplitude of the large scale fluctuation can be reduced until @xmath157 does not comply with the above condition . for other values of @xmath255 , the initial value of @xmath157",
    "must be smaller than a critical value in order to satisfy the above condition , in which case , the large scale amplitude will apparently be reduced arbitrarily .",
    "in fact , @xmath157 continues to decrease until the shear drops below the critical value separating between the two cases , at which moment the instability turns off .",
    "since @xmath263 at the end of recombination ( see e.g. figure [ runput4_figure ] ) , the switching off will take place at @xmath247 .",
    "to summarise , two possibilities for the damping of large scale waves seem to exist depending on the power @xmath255 relating the dependance of the damping rate with the amplitude of the isothermal wave . in the first case , any @xmath157 larger than roughly the critical value given by eq .

    ", one can numerically solve a simplified toy model for the process .",

    "[ dissipate_figure]a & [ dissipate_figure]b describe the numerical results for the integration of the two differential equations when @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath249 , for initial fluctuations of @xmath267 and different initial values of @xmath157 . by comparing to the numerical results to eq .",
    "[ damping_cases ] , it is clear that the analytical estimate is an over simplification of the differential equations , which too are a simplification of the real physics .",
    "nevertheless , the main conclusion is that for a large range of an initial large - scale amplitudes , it is possible to have almost all the energy dissipated into smaller scales and subsequently have it dissipated through nonlinear processes .",
    "the large scales then reach their natural lower limit  the value for which the large scale shear switches off the instability .",
    "-10pt    the implications are very interesting .",
    "the measured fluctuations in the microwave background radiation reflect the large scale structure after the fluctuations were reprocessed by the instability during recombination . in other words",
    ", the value oberved does not necessarily reflect the pre - recombination value of the fluctuations .",
    "it is possible to have an initially large large - scale amplitude , induce nonlinear small scale structure and eventually reduce the large scale amplitude .",
    "we have analysed the nonlinear growth of small scale isothermal fluctuation through the induced effect that large - scale perturbations have .",
    "the equations are solved through the separation of the large scale inhomogeneities into smaller regions where they can be considered uniform , and the shear @xmath105 exerted by the large scales is constant in space .",
    "this can be performed because the waves that interest us are waves with very small wavelengths and a very small propagation speed , such that over the integration time , the waves practically remain in the same region of space .",
    "small scale isothermal waves are found to be unstable if the large scale shear velocity between the `` photon fluid '' and the baryon fluid is larger than roughly twice the isothermal speed of sound at the time of recombination .",
    "a period when the logarithmic derivative of the opacity with respect to the density does not vanish but is @xmath97 instead . when the shear is smaller than the critical value , the solution found is qualitatively the same as the solution for the completely decoupled equations .",
    "the shear in this case may induce some quantitative corrections but the behaviour of the system does not change .",
    "the behaviour of the system is however radically different if the shear is larger than a critical value . for wavelength shorter than the roughly the jeans scale , the growth rate increases with @xmath123 and it saturates when @xmath268 , i.e. , at a scale which is a few times smaller than the jeans scale . the maximal growth rate attained is : @xmath269 if @xmath270 is much larger than all other rates in the system , it can be easily integrated over the duration of decoupling @xmath16 .",
    "the growth factor obtained is then : @xmath271 with the brackets denoting a temporal average .",
    "the isothermal waves are unstable because their sound speed is very small .",
    "consequently , the acoustic energy in a wave with a given amplitude is very small and the amount of work needed to increase its amplitude is nt large , in fact , it is so small that nonlinear effects start to take place already at @xmath272 !    even more surprising is the fact the the typical shears found in typical cosmological scenarios is _ exactly _ at the verge of having nonlinear effects take place !",
    "if the amplitude of the large scale fluctuations would have been an order of magnitude larger , then any isothermal perturbations , however small , could have been amplified right into the nonlinear regime . on the other hand ,",
    "if the typical amplitude would have been a few times smaller , the effect would have been completely meaningless .    for typical cosmological scenarios normalized to cobe",
    ", the growth parameter is roughly @xmath273 , e.g. , for an @xmath274 cdm model one finds @xmath275 , if the spectral index is tilted to @xmath276 , one finds @xmath277 , if a hot component is added at a 20% level to the untilted model , it falls to @xmath167 .",
    "the fate of the regions that do reach nonlinearity is still an open question",
    ". do these regions collapse and form black holes ?",
    "do they form an early generation of massive stars ?",
    "do they release enough energy to the environment and affect it , or perhaps , even form structure on much larger scales ?",
    "although some speculations of what might occur do exist in the context of early small scale structure formation , it is not entirely clear . moreover , nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations is probably unavoidable if we are to really solve the problem .",
    "the only relatively certain consequence is that the dissipation taking place after recombination heats the matter and it is likely to ionise it , raise its temperature to the ionisation temperature and leave an imprint on the cmbr in the form of a deviation from a planckian spectrum . in scenarios where @xmath278 , isothermal perturbations with an amplitude of as low as @xmath279 will be in fact theoretically detectable in the future .",
    "an amplitude of @xmath280 will leave 1% of the background sky with a detectable deviation . this fraction can change considerably if the density perturbations are not gaussian .    the detection of deviations from a planckian spectrum or the placing of an upper limit for them can result with interesting implications .",
    "any deviations found will first of all directly prove the existence of primordial isothermal fluctuations .",
    "second , such a detection will place stringent limits on cosmological parameters , as only those scenarios that produce a large enough @xmath157 are capable of producing nonlinear structure , and because the amount of nonlinearity is extremely sensitive to @xmath157 , it is also sensitive to the exact cosmological parameters . third , if the cosmological parameters are known with an large accuracy ( for example , through the fitting of the cmbr spectrum ) then the primordial isothermal perturbation spectrum at very large @xmath123 s can be estimated .",
    "even if no detection of a deviation from a planckian spectrum is found , one can place limits on cosmological parameters .",
    "moreover , if in the future it will be found that the cosmological parameters actually correspond to a high @xmath157 model , one will be able through the lack of detection of a @xmath227-parameter to place extremely powerful limits on the amplitude of the isothermal component of the primordial spectrum . through the press & vishniac effect",
    ", limits can also be placed on the adiabatic spectrum .",
    "another interesting implication is the possibility of transferring enough energy from the large to the small scales and considerably change the amplitude of the large - scales .",
    "this possibility relies on whether a significant volume fraction can be amplified out of the linear regime and on the maximum dissipation rate of nonlinear isothermal waves . under favourable circumstances ,",
    "the large scale amplitude can be significantly reduced such that @xmath157 calculated from the observed large scale fluctuations would only be of order unity .",
    "the fact that the observed fluctuations in the cmbr correspond to values of this order raises a very interesting question .",
    "why do the values of @xmath157 corresponding to the observed fluctuations happen to fall in a small region around unity ?",
    "is it because the universe was created with a fluctuation spectrum corresponding to this region , or , is it because @xmath157 that evolved from the initial cosmological parameters was actually larger but it was naturally reduced to the oberved value ?",
    "one can summarise the several plausible scenarios according to both the value of @xmath157 predicted by the cosmological model and the amplitude @xmath281 of the sub jeans scale isothermal fluctuations before the advent of recombination , these possibilities are :    1 .",
    "if @xmath157 is of order unity or less , the typical growth of isothermal waves is at most a few @xmath51-folds .",
    "the effect will be insignificant as the predicted micro degree size fluctuations are neither fluctuations of the temperature nor on a scale measurable in the near future . moreover , there are no implications at all to structure formation .",
    "2 .   for a value of @xmath282 , the effect will be measurable as patches in the cmbr with a distorted planckian spectrum . as long as @xmath283 , only a small fraction of the universe",
    "would have reached nonlinearity and formed small scale structure by the end of recombination . under certain circumstances",
    "however , it can lead to large scale structure formation through explosive amplification .",
    "3 .   for a value of @xmath157 such that @xmath284 , a large fraction of the universe reaches nonlinearity by the end of recombination and small scale structure is subsequently formed in most of the universe soon after recombination .",
    "the large scale spectrum is damped by transferring a significant amount of energy to the small scales , thus , the @xmath157 measured from the damped spectrum is smaller than the @xmath157 calculated when neglecting this process .",
    "in some cases , @xmath157 will be reduced to a values of order unity and it will mimic values on the boundary between the first and second scenarios . note that it will not affect fluctuations in components that decouple from the matter - radiation fluid before recombination ( e.g. dark matter fluctuation ) .",
    "the analysis presented here is the first step in the investigation of the radiation - matter interaction instability .",
    "more accurate integration is needed to improve the actual transfer function for isothermal waves .",
    "the analysis here was restricted to the evaluation of @xmath157 and it does not include the actual rates which are @xmath123 dependent .",
    "this approximation overestimates the rate of growth of finite sized @xmath123 s . in the present paper",
    "we have simulated the freezing of the instability due the freezing of recombination by stopping the integration abruptly at a given @xmath285 .",
    "however , the equilibrium conditions and therefore the switching off of the effect depend on the isothermal wavelength as well . by assuming this assumption , we have actually underestimated the contribution from waves of order the jeans size .    many of the possible implications depend on the quantitative behaviour of of the nonlinearities once they are reached .",
