    "in these lectures i discuss how to study some solutions to the einstein equations in a coordinate independent manner .",
    "the main ideas were presented lecture style in reference @xcite where the schwarzschild solution was studied in detail . here",
    "i will develop some background material on the frame bundles that was implicit in @xcite and present some unpublished studies about the black hole discovered by baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite that was of great interest at this institute .",
    "these lectures should be viewed as an addendum to the written up schwarzschild discussion .",
    "in general there is no global coordinate system or global frame you can impose on a manifold .",
    "if a manifold admits a global framing then it is called parallelizable and the list of such manifolds is small . for us",
    "the important fact is that every manifold @xmath0 has an associated parallelizable manifold called the bundle of frames .",
    "e.  cartan showed how to reconstruct the geometry of the manifold by studying the geometry of the frame bundle .",
    "we are are interested in semi - riemannian geometry where there is a metric on the manifold .",
    "the discussion that follows is the same in the strictly riemannian or the lorentzian case and we give it using the language of the former .",
    "assume we have an @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath0 with metric , _",
    "i.e. _ , for any pair of tangent vectors on @xmath0 we know how take their inner product",
    ". we can always locally find an orthonormal frame of tangent vector fields but in general this can not be extended globally .",
    "we can construct a fiber bundle whose local section are orthonormal frames .",
    "this bundle is called the orthonormal frame bundle @xmath2 of the manifold .",
    "it is a remarkable mathematical fact that this bundle is parallelizable , _",
    "i.e. _ , it admits a global framing .",
    "we discuss the construction of this bundle .",
    "let @xmath3 be an open cover of @xmath0 such that on each @xmath4 we can choose a fiducial orthonormal frame @xmath5 that we write as a row vector . on the overlap @xmath6 , the fiducial frames are related by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "this is just the statement that we have a metric . for simplicity",
    "we assume our manifold is orientable ( and also time orientable in the lorentzian case ) and this means that the `` transition functions '' @xmath9 may be restricted to orthogonal matrices with determinant one ( and also preserve the time orientation ) .",
    "we have that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 is another orthonormal frame at @xmath13 then there exists a unique orthogonal matrix @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the set of all orthonormal frames over @xmath4 is isomorphic to @xmath16 .",
    "the idea is to put all the @xmath16 together to make a bundle . to do this",
    "we require that if @xmath17 then we identify @xmath18 with @xmath19 via @xmath20 .",
    "this constructs a bundle @xmath21 with fiber isomorphic to @xmath22 called the bundle of orthonormal frames .",
    "we have that @xmath23 .",
    "we now show this bundle has a global framing .",
    "it is simpler to construct a coframing and we do this . on @xmath24 ,",
    "let @xmath25 be the frame dual to @xmath26 .",
    "the coframe @xmath25 is taken to be a row vector of @xmath27-forms on @xmath0 .",
    "the levi - civita connection @xmath28 is an anti - symmetric matrix of @xmath27-forms on @xmath4 that satisfy @xmath29 . on @xmath30",
    "define @xmath27-forms by using the pullback @xmath31 : @xmath32 note that the matrix of forms @xmath33 is antisymmetric .",
    "this is a coframing of @xmath34 because the @xmath35 tells you about `` horizontal '' motion and @xmath36 measures vertical motion .",
    "the @xmath35 and the @xmath33 are linearly independent @xmath27-forms on @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath37 is a local section then @xmath38 .",
    "this section gives a local framing @xmath39 with dual framing @xmath40 and levi - civita connection @xmath41 .",
    "using we see that we can obtain the same results by noting that the dual frame is @xmath42 and the local levi - civita connection is @xmath43 . to show this we need that a section satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "note that the @xmath27-forms @xmath42 and @xmath43 are linearly dependent @xmath27-forms on @xmath4 .",
    "it is not clear why this is useful until you observe that on overlaps @xmath45 we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 and therefore these define global @xmath27-forms @xmath48 , @xmath49 on @xmath2 .",
    "this is the global coframing of the frame bundle .",
    "this was discovered by e.  cartan .",
    "he pointed out that this coframe satisfies the structural equations @xmath50 the curvature functions @xmath51 are ordinary functions on the frame bundle that transforms nicely as you move up and down a fiber , _",
    "i.e. _ , under the action of @xmath22 .",
    "these are globally defined functions on the frame bundle . if we consider a local section @xmath52 of the frame bundle then the pullback functions @xmath53 on @xmath4 are the components of the curvature tensor with respect to the coframe @xmath54 .",
    "the main idea is to use the global coframing on the frame bundle to study the global geometry of black holes . in this way",
    "we will avoid the introduction of coordinate singularities or other confusions .    at this point",
    "the reader can read @xcite and see how these ideas can be applied to the study of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "he we will adapt the ideas presented and the notation used in that paper to study the btz black hole .",
    "the btz black hole is a black hole solution in @xmath55-dimensional gravity on a lorentzian manifold @xmath56 with a cosmological constant .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations with cosmological constant are @xmath57 taking the trace we see that @xmath58 and therefore we can write the above as @xmath59 since @xmath60 , the ricci tensor determines the full curvature tensor and therefore we see that we have a constant curvature manifold with @xmath61 this is a general result special to @xmath60 .",
    "this is the source of the big conundrum posed by the btz black hole .",
    "since the curvature is fully determined there is no room for gravitational waves ( degrees of freedom ) but the btz black hole has a temperature and thus an entropy .",
    "there should be degrees of freedom .",
    "what is going on ?",
    "this was discussed by others in this institute .",
    "we conclude with the following observations about the local geometry of @xmath56 .    1 .   ( @xmath62 )",

    "this can not be a black hole because of the homogeneity .",
    "if @xmath69 is a group of discrete isometries acting on @xmath68 then @xmath70 may be an interesting lorentz manifold .",
    "in general this manifold will not admit a transitive group of isometries and thus different parts of the manifold will have distinct properties .",
    "in fact , this is how the btz solution arises @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the btz solution is discussed in great detail in this article .",
    "we are very familiar with an analogous example .",
    "riemann surfaces with genus greater than one are the quotient of the upper half plane by a discrete subgroup of @xmath71 .",
    "the upper half plane with the poincar metric admits @xmath71 as a transitive group of isometries . after identifying points using the discrete subgroup we get a torus with at least two holes . such a manifold does not admit killing vectors and may only have discrete isometries .",
    "it is very different from the upper half plane even though locally they look alike because they have the same local curvature .",
    "a brief description of @xmath72 manifolds is given in appendix  [ sec : ads3-basics ] .",
    "assume @xmath56 is a @xmath73-dimensional lorentzian manifold that is both orientable and time orientable .",
    "this means that the structure group of of the orthonormal lorentz frame bundle is @xmath74 , the connected component of the lorentz group .",
    "we assume the spacetime is a semi - riemannian submersion @xmath75 with the fiber being a space - like @xmath27-dimensional manifold .",
    "the existence of the vertical distribution of vector fields means that the structure group of the reduced frame bundle @xmath76 is reduced to @xmath77 .",
    "a consequence is that there are no @xmath78 and only one @xmath79 .",

    "this action leads to a foliation of @xmath56 by the @xmath27-dimensional orbits . under some assumptions of a constant dimensionality of the orbits",
    "we can assume that this foliation is actually a fibration .",
    "our hypothesis tells us that @xmath99 . if @xmath100 is the isotropy group at @xmath101 then @xmath102 , _",

    "at @xmath98 we can write @xmath109 and the @xmath96 action tells us that both the riemannian metric on @xmath110 and the lorentzian metric on @xmath111 are invariant under the @xmath96 action . at @xmath98 , all geometrical structures must be invariant under the isotropy group action @xmath112 .",
    "the action of @xmath100 on @xmath113 is trivial . to see this let parametrize the points of @xmath97 as @xmath114",
    "then the action of @xmath96 is of the form @xmath115 . from this",
    "we see that @xmath116 and this implies that the isotropy group action is trivial on @xmath110 .",

    "subsequently we use the fourth equation to construct the full reduced frame bundle @xmath76 . studying the geometrical properties of @xmath0",

    "note that @xmath299 and this one way of concluding that @xmath300 .",
    "now we make a side excursion to locate a critical point of @xmath137 . since @xmath296 is constant along our geodesic",
    "we conclude that @xmath301 where we are . chose a null geodesic with @xmath302 and start moving ( sw direction ) .",
    "note that @xmath137 is constant and @xmath298 along this geodesic .",
    "equation tells us that @xmath303 along this sw directed geodesic .",
    "we stop when @xmath304 and we have found our nondegenerate critical point .",
    "note that if our side excursion had chosen @xmath305 ( ne direction ) then @xmath306 and we will not hit a critical point . since the critical point is nondegenerate we know the there must be a @xmath304 level set emanating from it ( see ) .",
    "we now go back to where we began the side excursion and continue along the the nw arrow .",
    "we note that @xmath301 remains constant along this trajectory .",
    "the key observation is that @xmath297 begins to decrease and goes negative while we are near @xmath186 but equation tells us that once we cross @xmath307 the sign of the right hand side of the @xmath308 equation changes sign .",
    "this means that @xmath309 begins to increase and reaches @xmath298 when @xmath187 .",
    "now we are ready for our second side excursion .",
    "you can verify that if you go along the null geodesic in the ne direction then @xmath296 increases and you will eventually get to @xmath304 and you have found another nondegenerate critical point .",
    "there is no critical point in the sw direction because @xmath296 would be decreasing .",
    "now we go back to the original geodesic and continue into a region of type i that contains @xmath156 .",
    "in finite affine parameter we hit @xmath156 .",
    "note that it is possible to escape to infinity by stopping and getting onto a null geodesic in the ne direction and getting away .",
    "notice that you will eventually wind up in a different type i region containing @xmath263 that is not the original one .    using this procedure and going forwards and backwards in time",
    "you can construct the penrose diagram for the btz spacetime .",
    "i would like to thank laurent baulieu , eliezer rabinovici , jan de boer , michael douglas , pierre vanhove and paul windey for giving me the opportunity to present these lectures .",
    "i would also like to thank elena gianolio for her assistance .",
    "three dimensional anti - desitter space is the coset manifold @xmath311 .",
    "this can be regarded as the `` hyperboloid '' surface @xmath312 in @xmath313 .",
    "note that this surface contains timelike circles .",
    "in fact if we define @xmath314 and @xmath315 then @xmath316 . note that we can choose @xmath317 and @xmath318 where @xmath319 . roughly , @xmath320 is the radius of the timelike circle and @xmath137 is the radius of the spacelike circle .",
    "this leads to a simple parametric description of the surface @xmath321 where @xmath322 , @xmath323 $ ] and @xmath324 $ ] . note that the timelike circles associated with @xmath160 are not contractible because the radius is bounded from below by @xmath325 .",
    "the circles associated with @xmath48 are contractible .",
    "this means that the topology of @xmath67 is that of @xmath326 .",
