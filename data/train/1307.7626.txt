    "astronomy has a long tradition of searching for the proverbial needle in the proverbial haystack , made all the more prominent in the current era of large systematic surveys of the night sky .",
    "the search for local group dwarf galaxies  groupings of stars tracking specific loci in luminosity and color  is a notable such example . as the number of dwarf galaxies has increased in parallel to the discovery of systems with ever fainter apparent luminosities , so have the intricacies of search techniques .",
    "putting aside the magellanic clouds whose proximity and luminosity renders them visible with the naked eye , initial discoveries of local group dwarf galaxies were made possible mid-20th century by the systematic observation of the night sky with photographic plates , such as the palomar observatory sky survey @xcite , or specific observations targeting the surroundings of the andromeda galaxy @xcite .",
    "although they were carried out for another 50 years , searches in these photographic surveys led to the discovery of a limited number of new dwarf galaxies at the expense of an excruciating search , followed up by epic campaigns of photometric observations to derive the color - magnitude diagram of dwarf - galaxy candidates ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "studies targeting the m31 surroundings were more tractable , yet still limited by the systematics of photographic plates ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of large ccd surveys and the homogeneity they entail significantly bolstered our knowledge of local group members .",
    "two particular surveys have been key to the significant increase in the number of known dwarf galaxies within a sphere of @xmath0-mpc radius : the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , mainly for the discovery of milky way companions , and the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ) for the discovery of companions to the m31/m33 couple .",
    "in addition , the interest of the ongoing panoramic telescope and rapid response system  1 ( pan - starrs1 ) survey for the search for local group dwarf galaxies has recently been made evident by the discovery of two new andromeda dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "algorithms developed to trawl these surveys for local group satellites have been more and more involved with the necessity to dig deeper and deeper into the noise , as well as with the requirement to determine the surveys completeness limits , a mandatory step to yield meaningful comparisons between observations of dwarf galaxy systems and their model counterparts .",
    "most of the techniques developed for searches through the sdss stellar catalog have relied on more or less complex color(-color)-magnitude cuts so as to inspect only the distribution of stars with the broad properties of dwarf - galaxy members @xcite , or that of stars which more closely follow fiducial tracks in color - magnitude space @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting catalog is then either binned , or convolved with a search - kernel , to enable the location of significant stellar overdensities .",
    "care nevertheless needs to be given to misidentified red background galaxies whose clustering can easily create false - positives .",
    "the comparison of the algorithmic significance from stellar catalogs with their application to the catalog of galaxies from the same survey , or the application of a detection - area criterion have both been used in the past to limit the number of these false - positives @xcite .    despite the improved efficiency of these more involved search algorithms compared to the mere inspection of photographic plates ,",
    "they are still limited by at least two factors : the use of sharp color - magnitude cuts which effectively give a probability of 0 or 1 for an object to be a potential dwarf - galaxy - member star , and not directly accounting for contaminants through forward - modeling of local catalog objects . in theory",
    ", it would seem that the maximum - likelihood - based matched - filter ( mf ) technique ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , applied without binning the data , could bypass both these limitations .",
    "however , it is too often forgotten that a mandatory requirement for the mf technique is the assumption of a _ uniform _ contamination ; this requirement is seldom validated for dwarf galaxy searches that span large fractions of the mw sky and , therefore , suffer from varying contamination . as a consequence , even though its straight application can lead to some discoveries ( e.g. @xcite ) , their true significance is difficult to quantify .    in this paper",
    ", we embark on a systematic search for dwarf galaxies in the pandas survey .",
    "so far , all dwarf galaxies discovered in pandas have been unveiled as high - significance detections through the use of techniques similar to those described above : as clear overdensities in the distribution of stellar sources compatible with m31 red - giant - branch stars @xcite , or through the application of a mf technique for the faintest ones @xcite . these new dwarf galaxies have already revealed significant clues about the m31 satellite system ( e.g. @xcite ) . yet",
    ", fainter dwarf galaxies , essential to constrain the faint end of galaxy formation , must remain to be discovered given the low luminosity systems observed around the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) and hints seen in the m31 outer halo @xcite .",
    "moreover , a systematic search will enable us to determine the search completeness limits , a necessary tool to reliably compare observations with predictions from models of galaxy formation in a cosmological context .",
    "the search technique developed here aims at modeling all sources of contamination ( background compact galaxies , foreground milky way stars , and m31 stellar halo stars ) and we place ourselves in a bayesian framework to forward - model , at once , the distribution of pandas stellar sources in _ both _ spatial and color - magnitude spaces .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows :  2 is devoted to a quick description of the pandas survey and data , and the data preparation for the particular problem at hand ;  3 presents the dwarf galaxy search algorithm and focusses on the ingredients of our family of models , our priors , and the application to the pandas data ; the findings of the algorithm are detailed and discussed in  4 before we conclude in  5 .",
    "although presented as a dwarf - galaxy - search algorithm , it should be noted that the basics of the algorithm detailed here can be applied to other searches through any catalog with only minimal modifications .",
    "as long as one has a family of reliable models in the parameter space of the catalog for the targets of the search , the principles laid out below remain applicable .",
    "the pandas survey is a large programme of the canada - france - hawaii telescope conducted with the megaprime / megacam wide - field camera over the period 20082011 ( @xcite , mcconnachie et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "it builds on a pilot survey of the andromeda surroundings observed with the same instrument and set - up from 2003 until 2008 @xcite . at its completion ,",
    "the survey encompasses most of the region within a projected radius of @xmath1 from m31 , and @xmath2 from m33 . in total",
    ", it has a coverage of @xmath3deg@xmath4 .",
    "each pointing of the 1-deg@xmath4 megacam camera was observed in two bands ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) for @xmath7minutes under good to excellent conditions ( seeing @xmath8 and median seeing values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the @xmath5- and @xmath6-band , respectively ) .",
    "the details of the data reduction will be presented in an upcoming publication coinciding with the public release of the survey ( mcconnachie et al .",
    ", in preparation ; see also ibata et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in short",
    ", the data are preprocessed by cfht through their elixir system ( this includes de - biasing , flat - fielding , and fringe - correcting the data as well as determining the photometric zero points ) before they are further processed using a version of the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) photometry pipeline @xcite which was specially tailored to cfht / megacam observations . here , the astrometry of individual frames is refined and this information is used to register and then stack component images to create the final image products from which the survey catalogs are generated",
    ". finally , the astrometry is further refined , and objects from the catalogs are morphologically classified ( stellar , non - stellar , noise - like ) before creating the final band - merged @xmath5 and @xmath6 products .",
    "the catalogs provide additional quality control information , and the classification step also computes the aperture corrections required to place the photometry on an absolute scale . the band - merged catalogs for each field are then combined to form an overall single entry @xmath5 , @xmath6 catalog for each detected object . in regions of overlapping fields , only the data from the best - seeing field is kept.the photometric calibration is performed from a combination of staggered short megcam exposures and ps1 photometry @xcite kindly shared by the ps1 science consortium .",
    "the work presented in this paper relies entirely on the catalog from objects reliably classified as stars in both bands .",
    "all objects are de - reddened using the @xcite @xmath11 maps , scaled with coefficients derived from the sdss extinction coefficient and the sdss to megacam color equations :    @xmath12    here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to observed , calibrated magnitudes , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 to their de - reddened equivalent which will be used throughout this paper . to avoid unnecessary clutter ,",
    "the @xmath15 subscript will henceforth often be dropped but the reader should remember that we only refer to de - reddened magnitudes .    despite the systematic coverage of the pandas survey , there are holes in the data , stemming from chip gaps , the presence of saturated bright stars , or a few ccd failures .",
    "it would be possible to model these holes out in our analysis , but it was deemed easier to fill the holes by duplicating all the information from neighboring regions ( see ibata et al .",
    ", in preparation , for more details ) .",
    "these artificial areas are nevertheless tagged so they do not lead to spurious detections in our search for dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , regions of high stellar density around m31 , m33 , ngc  147 &  185 are removed from the catalog as they correspond to regions in which crowding becomes an issue , or regions for which the hope of finding a new dwarf galaxy is very slim given the overwhelming presence of contamination from these galaxies .",

    "the m31 rgb selection box is made wide enough so it accounts for increasing photometric uncertainties towards fainter magnitudes , but stops at bright enough magnitudes in both bands to be highly complete for all pandas fields .",
    "although a dwarf galaxy located closer to us than m31 would have a fraction of its stars , near the trgb , that would be brighter than the selection box bright limit , the fraction of these stars is negligible compared to the increasingly numerous stars at fainter magnitudes that will fall in the box .",
    "we therefore decide to tailor the selection box to the trgb at the distance of m31 in order not to add many non - m31 stars to our sample .",
    "finally , the equatorial coordinates of any star , @xmath23 , are projected on the plane tangential to the celestial sphere at the location of m31 .",

    "although this is not the case for faint dwarf galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , the target systems will contain so few stars in pandas that any constraint on the ellipticity will be loose at best .",
    "thus , the cost of the added two parameters ( the ellipticity and the position angle of the galaxy s major axis ) is judged prohibitive for the little added benefit to the final significance of a detection .    _",
    "* the dwarf galaxy cm models . *",
    "_ in cm space , there is no analytic expression for the pdf of a dwarf galaxy s stars and we therefore rely on the use of theoretical isochrones and luminosity functions .",

    "these have a standard deviation of @xmath61 in the @xmath6-magnitude direction and @xmath62 in the color direction , yielding    @xmath63    with @xmath64 and @xmath65 a normalizing constant calculated such that the integral of @xmath58 over the considered region of cm space is unity .    at this point",
    ", the dwarf galaxy cm - space models are defined by an age , a metallicity , and a distance modulus",
    ". however , the well - known age / metallicity / distance degeneracy at the rgb level makes it unnecessary to keep all three parameters in the analysis as the data are mainly incapable of discriminating between metallicity , age , or distance shifts .",
    "given the consistently old stellar populations present in all the faint dwarf galaxies previously discovered within the pandas survey , we consider only a single age of @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the faint dwarf galaxies so far discovered have severely undersampled rgbs and any constraint on their distance modulus is loose at best .",
    "@xcite determined that the typical distance uncertainty for such a system , although dependent on the amount of contamination from other stellar populations , can reach 100200kpc for the faintest dwarf galaxies .",
    "since this is a sizable fraction of the m31 virial radius and an inadequate model distance modulus will be mainly compensated for by a simple shift in the model metallicity , we fix the distance modulus of the dwarf galaxy models to that of the andromeda galaxy , @xmath17 .",

    "would significantly slow it down , we artificially inflate the photometric uncertainties with an additional photometric scatter term , @xmath68 , chosen so that the resulting pdf looks similar to the distribution of rgb stars in known pandas dwarf galaxies , this scatter in color corresponds to a scatter in metallicity of @xmath69  dex , which would of course increase / decrease for lower / higher metallicities . ] . in other words ,",
    "we substitute @xmath70 and @xmath61 in the previous equation with    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the observed photometric uncertainties of the data we are modelling . for their expressions",

    "one should in theory further account for the incompleteness of the data in equation  ( [ eqn : rho_dw_cm ] ) , a field - dependent property , but we circumvent this difficulty by limiting ourselves to the pandas magnitude range we know to be homogeneously complete over the survey ( @xmath74 ) .    for the isochrones and luminosity functions , we use the models of @xcite , but note that any reasonable set of isochrones and luminosity functions produce similar significance results for the search , as the algorithm mainly builds on the broad properties of the models . this was tested on a small region with a set of dartmouth models @xcite .",
    "_ * the full dwarf galaxy models . *",
    "_ under the final assumption that there are no stellar population radial gradients in the dwarf galaxy models , the sky - projected - color - magnitude joint pdf of a star belonging to the dwarf galaxy model is simply the product of the sky - projected pdf with the cm pdf . for a dwarf galaxy containing @xmath75 member stars , we therefore have    @xmath76    and @xmath77 .",
    "the main difficulty in finding faint dwarf galaxies in the pandas footprint comes from the presence of numerous foreground or background contamination sources ( foreground faint milky way dwarf stars , m31 halo giant stars , unresolved background compact galaxies that appear as point sources ) , which swamp the minute stellar overdensities that betray the presence of a low luminosity dwarf galaxy .",
    "it is therefore essential to have a good contamination model both on the sky and in cm space .",
    "_ * the contamination spatial models . * _ in the plane of the sky , we assume that the density of contaminating sources , @xmath78 , is locally well approximated by a uniform distribution around any location @xmath50 in the pandas footprint .",
    "although this is clearly not true on large scales given the very structured nature of the m31 stellar halo , this is a good approximation on the scale of dwarf galaxies that subtend sizes of only a few arcminutes . in order to determine the local density of stars around @xmath50 , the density of sources in the m31 rgb cm - box is calculated for the 36 azimuthally - divided wedges of an annulus centered on @xmath50 , of inner radius @xmath79 and outer radius @xmath80 .",
    "the median of the densities thus measured is taken as the value of @xmath78 .",
    "doing so , we are less sensitive to the presence of localized overdensities ( e.g. a neighboring dwarf galaxy , globular cluster , or the presence of a nearby stellar stream ) than if we were to take the density of the whole annulus .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the annulus have been chosen to be large enough that the annulus is unlikely to contain stars from a faint dwarf galaxy centered on @xmath50 , but to still provide a good representation of the contamination at @xmath50 .",
    "_ * the contamination cm models . *",
    "_ determining the pdf of these contaminating sources in cm - space , @xmath81 , is a more trying task as it depends strongly on both the type of contaminants , and the location in the survey footprint : foreground galactic disk stars are much more numerous in the red part of the cm - space than in the blue part , dominated by milky way halo stars , whereas m31 stellar halo contaminants are more prominent at faint magnitudes . at the same time , milky way ( mw ) contaminants are more important toward the northern edge of the pandas footprint which is closer to the galactic plane , whereas m31 stellar halo stars are crowding the regions close to m31 , and background compact galaxies are present throughout the survey s footprint .",
    "we therefore model the pdf of contaminants at any location in cm - space as the sum of a ( mainly ) mw contamination , @xmath82 , and an m31-related contamination , @xmath83 .",
    "region @xmath84 used to build the mw contamination model .",
    "the hashed regions are masked out and not used to fit the contamination model .",
    "they correspond to clear stellar overdensities in the pandas footprint . ]",
    "_ the milky way cm contamination models . _",
    "the mw contamination pdf is empirically modelled from the data themselves and allowed to vary with the location in the survey .",
    "the density map of figure  [ contamination_mask ] shows the density of stellar objects in the pandas survey which have a color and magnitude compatible with an m31 rgb star .",
    "it reveals the exponential increase of sources to the north ( that also happens to mainly correspond to the direction towards the galactic plane ) , which is a consequence of the proximity with the mw disk , but this contamination varies differently and is less significant when selecting only very blue stars .",
    "the foreground contaminants are expected to either follow an exponential density increase towards the galactic plane ( i.e along the @xmath85 axis ) for disk stars , as well as a slight increase towards the direction of decreasing @xmath86 ( i.e. mainly decreasing galactic longitude ) , or to be reasonably flat over the survey for halo stars and background compact galaxies masquerading as stars .",
    "consequently , we model the density of contaminants at location @xmath50 , at a given color and magnitude @xmath87 , as an exponential increase in both the @xmath86 and @xmath85 directions :    @xmath88    the functions @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are determined from a field region , @xmath84 , of the pandas survey which is outside of @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 at the distance of m31 ) from andromeda s center and further excise any obvious stellar stream or dwarf galaxy , as well as the region around the m33 galaxy ( the hashed region in figure  [ contamination_mask ] ) .",
    "although the m31 stellar halo is still present at the edge of the pandas survey ( ibata et al . in preparation ) , such contamination is minimal in these regions .",
    "for the center @xmath87 of each pixel on a fine grid in cm - space , with separations 0.02 in color and magnitude , we proceed to construct a binned spatial map of stellar objects from all stars within a @xmath94 magnitude box in cm - space , centered on @xmath87 .",
    "a weight map is also built from the map counts by assuming poisson uncertainties . using only the map pixels which fall in region @xmath84 ,",

    "although surprising at first , this is confirmed by a detailed study of the complex and structured mw stellar halo over the pandas footprint , as will be detailed in another contribution .",

    "before moving to the results of the algorithmic search applied over the whole pandas survey , let us first focus on the region around three known dwarf galaxies , and  xi , xii , and  xiii , and study the detailed output of the algorithm for and around these faint systems .",
    "the first two panels in the top row of figure  [ results_andxi - xiii ] compare the original smoothed stellar density with the significance of detections for every pixel in the region considered .",
    "it is readily evident that the significance map is a huge improvement over a blind search for overdensities in the smoothed density map of all rgb stars .",
    "the three known dwarf galaxies in the region , as well as a bright globular cluster ( mgc1 ; @xcite ) , produce four very significant detections .",
    "even and  xii , one of the faintest known m31 satellites with a total magnitude of @xmath163 , corresponds to a detection with @xmath164 .",
    "moreover , supposedly empty m31 halo regions around the four prominent detections invariably have low significance with at most a few isolated detections with @xmath165 .",
    "this is a very promising output , emphasizing the efficiency of the algorithm as well as the usefulness of using both the spatial and cmd information when searching for dwarf galaxies .",
    "one could wonder why mgc1 is also found with high significance by the algorithm as it is a compact globular cluster .",
    "despite the core of the cluster being unresolved , the high luminosity of this specific cluster , as well as its very extended halo @xcite , lead to tens of outer cluster stars being resolved in the pandas survey and forming a reasonably large overdensity of rgb stars , not unlike the dwarf galaxies the algorithm is tailored to find .",
    "this is a rather exceptional case as the megacam pixel size ( @xmath166 ) and the seeing are usually too large to allow for resolved m31 globular clusters but we will see in the next section that there is a handful of globular and extended clusters ( gcs and ecs ) that are found with compelling significances .",
    "the other maps of figure  [ results_andxi - xiii ] present the parameters of the most probable model for each pixel .",
    "the fraction of the mw contribution to the overall contamination model , @xmath116 , remains consistently high , as expected for an outer halo region with a low density of m31 rgb stars ( see figure  [ m31_pandas ] and ibata et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . as a consequence , most of the panel showing the favored halo metallicity , @xmath114 , is not well constrained , or simply noise",
    "however , it shows some interesting variations where the fraction of the m31 contamination is non - zero .",
    "in particular , one can see variations in the m31 stellar halo metallicity for potential stellar structures , likely hosting different stellar populations ( ibata et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the lack of significance of most of the region s pixels means that the favored dwarf metallicity , @xmath56 , varies a lot over the region since it is meaningless for models with low @xmath160 .",
    "there are , however , noticeable regions of contiguous pixels at the location of the three dwarf galaxies and mgc1 for which @xmath56 becomes well defined at the preferred value for this dwarf galaxy ( and the assumption of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the last two panels show the maps for the two parameters which are directly impacted by the priors we chose .",
    "the number of stars in the dwarf galaxy part of the model is dominated by small numbers , as expected from the prior if there is no significant overdensity of stars that would follow our dwarf galaxy model .",
    "one can also notice that the few detections with the largest significance also have a non - negligible number of stars in their preferred model .",
    "the algorithm favors models with @xmath167 , or about 30 stars , although one should remember that @xmath132 is sampled with steps of 0.5 , meaning that the numbers of stars within the rgb box in these dwarf galaxies is likely to be in the 2065 range , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "finally , the map for the favored @xmath146 behaves similarly to that for @xmath132 in that regions with no significant detection have a preferred size driven by the peak of our prior , around @xmath125 . close to significant detections",
    ", the size of the preferred model tends to increase at the same time as the significance rises .",
    "this is an edge effect as the algorithm starts to feel that there is a significant number of m31 rgb - like stars close to the considered pixel but , since this pixel is not at the center of the dwarf galaxy , it finds them at odds with the assumed , peaked radial distribution .",
    "the situation is mitigated by favoring an extended model , as flat as possible .",
    "one can also notice a similar effect in the map for @xmath116 and @xmath114 , for which the algorithm mitigates for the close presence of an overdensity of likely m31 rgb stars by including them in the m31 halo contamination .",
    "overall , the impact of these effects is negligible in our study since all pixels near a significant detection are bundled together and considered as parts of the same detection .     significance distribution for the region around and  xi - xiii .",
    "the black line represents the histogram of pixel significance values for the final algorithm whereas the gray histogram corresponds to the significance values when the priors on @xmath132 and @xmath146 are substituted with a flat prior . in the latter case ,",
    "the tail of high significance values becomes evident at larger @xmath160 values .",
    "the threshold signal value , @xmath168 , chosen for this region is shown by the red arrow . ]",
    "if the model were a perfect representation of the data , the distribution of pixel significances would be gaussian - like for non - negligible significance values , and a tail at high - significance values should be produced by the presence of dwarf - galaxy - like systems in the data .",
    "it is this tail of high - significance pixels we wish to identify .",
    "the distribution of pixel significances for the region around and xi - xiii is displayed in figure  [ significance_hist_andxi - xiii ] as the black histogram and , except for low significance values for which our significance criterion breaks down , the distribution indeed has a gaussian behavior until it reaches an almost flat level at the high - significance end .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is well marked and guides us in the choice of a detection threshold over which pixels are considered to be worthwhile .",
    "although the exact location of the threshold is not very important , a threshold that is too low will secure more potential discoveries , but also yield many detections that are mere noise fluctuations in the data .",
    "conversely , a threshold that is too high will only yield secured dwarf galaxy detections but will be of little use in our search for fainter dwarf galaxies than the ones we already know . for this region ,",
    "the high - significance tail starts to deviate from the exponential decline of the distribution for values larger than @xmath169 , a value we use as the detection threshold , @xmath168 , for this region ( red arrow ) .",
    "figure  [ significance_hist_andxi - xiii ] also shows the impact of the priors on the significance , with the gray histogram being produced if we substitute the priors on @xmath132 and @xmath146 with flat priors . in an effort to compensate for the not - quite locally flat m31 stellar halo contamination , the algorithm then finds many mildly significant detections that are as flat as allowed by the considered dwarf galaxy models , i.e. a preferred @xmath146 as large as possible and a non - zero preferred @xmath75",
    ". these artificial detections ( which are not favored when the priors of sub - section  [ section : priors ] are applied ) stretch the significance distribution to larger values , and consequently swarm parts of the real detections .",
    "once the detection threshold is selected , the production of a list of detections is only one step away , namely after dealing with the fact that , as can be seen in the second , top - most panel of figure  [ results_andxi - xiii ] , more than a single pixel has a high significance value near a detection . in order to bundle together pixels belonging to the same detection",
    ", we order the pixels by significance and , starting with the most significant pixel , we recursively include in a detection all the pixels that are within a radius of 20 pixels ( or @xmath170 ) of this current most significant pixel .",

    "looking at this figure , one should keep in mind that the data become increasingly incomplete below @xmath187 , which plays to counteract the natural increase of the lf at fainter magnitudes .",
    "one can nevertheless notice significant non - zero counts for the lf below this limit for the top third most significant isolated detections , confirming the present of stars that are nt accounted for in the field .",
    "these stars were not used by the search algorithm , thereby yielding an independent detections of the reality of at least some of these detections .",
    "the absence of a clear bump in the lf that would correspond to the presence of a well - defined horizontal branch could easily be explained by the likely different distances to all these detections , blurring out any signal from a faint horizontal branch .",
    "the lf of the least significant isolated detections listed in table  [ table : detection_list ] ( bottom panel of figure  [ combined_lfs ] ) shows a very marginal detection of extra stars fainter than @xmath187 , making the reality of these detection less likely , although , if they are real , these would likely be very faint dwarf galaxies , and correspondingly much more difficult to find without deep and complete data .    as a final note",
    ", it is worth mentioning that our detection  124 overlaps with one of the hi clouds discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their detection 4 ) .",
    "we have presented a generic algorithm to search for stellar overdensities in a photometric catalog and applied this algorithm to trawl the pandas data set of the surroundings of the andromeda galaxy for dwarf galaxies .",
    "all known dwarf galaxies have been found at high significance ( @xmath188 ) in the list of 143 most significant detections returned by the algorithm .",
    "some gcs are also detected , and a new ec was discovered ( pandas-31 ) . at least some of the algorithm s unknown detections share the properties of dwarf galaxies fainter than those currently known around m31 .",
    "they should be followed up by the community with deep photometry , with the hope of confirming the first very faint m31 satellite dwarf galaxies , likely with properties similar to leo  iv , or uma  ii around the mw , but without the strong distance bias in the search for such systems within the sdss or the pan - starrs1 survey @xcite .",
    "the development of an efficient dwarf - galaxy - search algorithm is not only necessary to potentially unveil even fainter dwarf galaxies than those currently known ( the goal of this paper ) , but also it is mandatory to derive the dwarf galaxy completeness limits of the pandas survey .",
    "these are cardinal in understanding the global properties of the satellite system ( structure of the satellite system , ( an)isotropy , luminosity function , etc ) as they enable a reliable correction from the survey s observational effects , as well as the strong variation of the mw and m31 stellar halo contamination throughout the survey s footprint .",
    "they will be derived in an upcoming contribution .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that the search algorithm presented here is applicable to the search of any source distribution in a photometric catalog and , even more generically , to _ any _ source distribution in _ any _ catalog , inasmuch as reliable models of the signal and contamination can be computed .",

    "<S> accounting for the significant contamination from the milky way foreground and from the structured stellar halo of the andromeda galaxy , we recover all known dwarf galaxies in the pandas footprint with high significance , even for the least luminous ones . some andromeda globular clusters are also recovered and , in one case , discovered . </S>",
    "<S> we publish a list of the 143 most significant detections yielded by the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the combined properties of the 39 most significant isolated detections show hints that at least some of these trace genuine dwarf galaxies , too faint to be individually detected . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up observations by the community are mandatory to establish which are real members of the andromeda satellite system . </S>",
    "<S> the search technique presented here will be used in an upcoming contribution to determine the pandas completeness limits for dwarf galaxies . </S>",
