    "observations of magnetic fields in star forming regions ( e.g. crutcher 1991 ) tell us that the plasma @xmath0 is of order @xmath1 and that the velocity dispersion is of the order of the alfvn speed . for this reason , many of the simulations of the early stages of star formation ( e.g. fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ; ballesteros - paredes & mac - low 2002 ; falle & hartquist 2002 ; padoan & nordlund 2002 ; gammie et al .",
    "2003 ) have assumed that the initial value of @xmath0 is low .",
    "these papers show that dense structures can be formed under these conditions , but they do not consider how @xmath0 came to be so low in the first place .    on scales large compared to the separation between clouds ,",
    "the thermal and magnetic pressures in the interstellar medium are comparable .",
    "locally @xmath0 may be about @xmath2 , while in the midplane at a distance of 5 kpc from the galactic centre , it may be about @xmath3 ( ferriere 1998 ) .",
    "the production of a star forming region must therefore also reduce @xmath0 by a considerable factor . here",
    "we examine a mechanism for this which relies upon pressure driven compression and radiative cooling .",
    "this process produces a transient structure , but this is not in conflict with estimates of only a few million years for the ages of the stars in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ( ballesteros - paredes , et al .",
    "1999 ; hartman 2003 ) .",
    "this is also not very different from the time that a clump moving at the observed velocities of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 takes to travel a significant fraction of the size of a gmc ( @xmath6 pc ) .",
    "we shall therefore assume that gmcs are transient and that their formation is triggered by external disturbances .",
    "we make no attempt to follow the entire evolution of a gmc ; instead we describe an idealised numerical calculation that illustrates how a cloud might make the transition from a state with moderate @xmath0 to one with low @xmath0 .",
    "a significant fraction of interstellar space is filled by @xmath7 k gas , which is composed of overlapping supernova remnants ( cox & smith 1974 ; mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "this gas is continually being reheated by shocks from supernova explosions .",
    "one estimate ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) indicates that , on average , this causes the pressure at any given point to fluctuate significantly on timescales of the order of a million years or less .",
    "such pressure fluctuations also appear in simulations of the structure of the interstellar medium ( e.g. gazol - patio & passot 1999 ; korpi et al .",
    "1999 ; de avillez & breitschwerdt 2004 , 2005 ; mac - low et al . 2005 ) . de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) and mac - low et al .",
    "( 2005 ) do , indeed , find low @xmath0 regions in their simulations .",
    "however , these are global simulations containing a number of ingredients , so that it is not entirely clear how these regions are produced .",
    "our idealised calculation not only has the advantage that the mechanism is clear , but also makes it possible to use higher resolution than is possible in a global simulation .",
    "as we shall see later , even this higher resolution is not sufficient to follow the entire evolution accurately .",
    "for the heating and cooling rates appropriate for diffuse atomic gas , there are two thermally stable phases which can be in pressure equilibrium with each other for a range of thermal pressures .",
    "the low density warm phase is at @xmath8 k , while the high density cold phase is at @xmath9 k. if molecules form , as they do in the clumps within gmcs , then the temperature of the cold stable phase decreases .",
    "the thermal pressure in the warm phase has a maximum above which only the cold phase can be in thermal equilibrium .    as a simple model of the thermal behaviour of the material in the cloud",
    "we adopt the following form for the net heating rate per unit volume    @xmath10 \\mbox{~~erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$}\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath11    ( snchez - salcedo et .",
    "al 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is of the same form as that appropriate for the diffuse atomic gas ( wolfire et al .",
    "if we ignore the dependence of the ionization fraction on temperature , then the pressure is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 gm is the mean particle mass . for this model ,",
    "the maximum density and pressure of the warm phase in thermal equilibium are @xmath2 @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . here",
    "@xmath17 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "it is well known that a transition from the warm to the cold phase can be triggered by a relatively small pressure increase caused either by flow convergence ( hennebelle & prault 1999 , 2000 ) or a weak shock ( koyama & inutsuka 2000 , 2002 , 2004 ) . if @xmath0 is initially of order unity , then this transition can produce a small value of @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore consider a cloud which is initially in the warm phase and in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding hotter material .",
    "the hot gas can be assumed to be adiabatic , but both heating and radiative cooling are important within the cloud .",
    "we then suppose that the cloud is subjected to an increase in the pressure of the surrounding hot material from a value at which the warm phase exists to one at which it does not .",
    "the pressure increase is assumed to take place on a timescale that is short compared to the time required for the cloud to adjust .    in all the calculations , the cloud is initially in thermal equilibrium in the warm phase with a number density of @xmath18 @xmath15 , corresponding to a temperature of @xmath19 k and a pressure of @xmath20 .",
    "the external pressure is imposed by embedding the cloud in uniform hot material with density @xmath21 @xmath15 with the appropriate pressure .",
    "this material is not in thermal equilibrium , but its cooling time is so long that it can be assumed to behave adiabatically .",
    "the initial magnetic field is in the axial direction and is uniform everywhere with a pressure equal to the thermal pressure in the cloud i.e. @xmath22 in the cloud .",
    "since the cloud is initially spherical , the flow remains axisymmetric .",
    "table 1 lists the external pressure and size of the cloud for the five cases considered . changing the cloud radius only affects the ratio of cloud radius to the cooling length behind the fast mode shock that propagates into the cloud .",
    "this ratio is @xmath23 for a cloud radius of @xmath24 pc .",
    "note that the external thermal pressures are well within the range found in global simulations .",
    "lcc & external gas pressure & cloud radius + model a & @xmath25 & @xmath24 pc + model b & @xmath26 & @xmath24 pc + model c & @xmath27 & @xmath28 pc + model d & @xmath29 & @xmath24 pc +   + model e & @xmath26 & @xmath24 pc    model e explores the effect of an external thermal pressure , @xmath30 , that decreases with time according to    @xmath31    here @xmath32 is the initial external thermal pressure and @xmath33 yrs , which is approximately twice the time it takes the fast shock to return to the edge of the cloud ( see section [ results ] ) .      all the calculations were done in axisymmetry using the unstructured hierarchical adaptive grid code described in falle & giddings 1993 .",
    "this uses a hierarchy of grids @xmath34 such that the mesh spacing on grid @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "grids @xmath37 and @xmath38 cover the whole domain , but the finer grids only exist where they are needed .",
    "the solution at each position is calculated on all grids that exist there and the difference between these solutions is used to control refinement . in order to ensure courant number matching at the boundaries between coarse and fine grids , the timestep on grid @xmath35 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the timestep on @xmath37 .",
    "such a grid structure is very efficient for flows that contain very thin dense regions since it confines the fine grids to where they are needed .",
    "the basic algorithm is an mhd version of the second order godunov scheme described in falle ( 1991 ) .",
    "this uses a linear riemann solver and the divergence cleaning algorithm described in dedner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the cloud radius .",
    "the boundary conditions are symmetry on the @xmath44 plane and the axis and free flow conditions elsewhere .",
    "the low density in the external gas ensures that the boundaries at @xmath45 and @xmath46 have a neglible effect on the solution .",
    "there were @xmath47 grid levels with the finest being @xmath48 .",
    "this gives a mesh spacing of @xmath49 pc for models a , c , d , e and @xmath50 pc for model b. even though this is significantly higher resolution than that attained by de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) and mac - low et al .",
    "( 2005 ) it is not sufficient to follow the complete evolution of the cloud .",
    "it is , however , enough to show the formation of the fragments that we identify with the translucent clumps and to give some insight into their initial evolution .",
    "figure 1 shows grey - scale maps of the number density , magnetic field lines and @xmath0 for model a at the times shown .",
    "a fast mode shock is driven into the cloud , which reflects off the symmetry axis and returns to the edge of the cloud at the last time shown in figure 1 ( @xmath51 yrs ) . at this point",
    "most of the cloud has @xmath52 and is in the thermally unstable temperature range .",
    "note that self - gravity can only have a minor effect upon the dynamics up to this point since even at the latest time shown in the figure , the free - fall time is @xmath53 yrs , whereas the crossing time at the thermal sound speed is @xmath54 yrs and that at the fast mode speed is @xmath55 yrs .    at this point",
    "the mean density of the cloud is @xmath56 @xmath15 , which is typical of that in a gmc .",
    "furthermore , the low value of @xmath0 provides the ideal conditions for the generation of density inhomogeneities by magnetohydrodynamic waves ( falle & hartquist 2002 ) , particularly since most of the gas is in the thermally unstable temperature range .",
    "the end result must be the formation of dense regions that are in the cold phase embedded in diffuse warm phase .",
    "indeed , figure 1 shows that such dense regions have already begun to form at the latest time shown .",
    "unfortunately , we can not follow the evolution of these dense regions much beyond this because not only does the numerical resolution become inadequate , but self - gravity begins to influence the large scale dynamics of the cloud",
    ". however , it is clear that these regions will eventually come into approximate pressure equilibrium with the rest of the cloud , in which case their densities must be in the range @xmath57 @xmath15 .",
    "this is typical of the densities in the translucent clumps in gmcs ( e.g. williams , et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "there is also a slow mode shock which moves much slowly than the fast mode shock because the reduction in the magnetic pressure across it means there is nothing to stop the gas being compressed as it cools , so that it comes into thermal equilibrium in the cold phase .",
    "this shock therefore produces a thin dense shell near the boundary of the cloud in which @xmath58 . since the post - shock gas is in the thermally unstable regime , this process is unstable and we would expect the thin shell to fragment .",
    "our calculations show that this does indeed occur at later times .",
    "as one would expect , the increase in magnetic field inhibits collapse perpendicular to the field so that the cloud becomes flattened along the field lines .",
    "the slow shock must eventually eliminate the difference between the thermal pressures in the surroundings and the cloud so that it ends up as a thin disc in which @xmath0 is of the same order as that in the surroundings .",
    "however , this process is not complete until @xmath59 yrs .",
    "the behaviour of the other simulations is similar , except that larger external pressures lead to faster evolution and smaller values of @xmath0 . in order to quantify this , in figure 2",
    "we show the fraction of the volume of the cloud for which @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear that in all cases there is an extended period during which @xmath60 in much of the volume of the cloud .",
    "figure 3 shows that for models a and b , there is also a significant fraction of each cloud for which @xmath61 .",
    "the results for model e show that there is still a reasonable volume of low @xmath0 material even when the external thermal pressure decreases with time , although the timescale for this decrease must not be much smaller than that in model e. for example , there is little low @xmath0 material when @xmath62 is reduced to half this value .",
    "although a significant fraction of the volume of each cloud is occupied by material with low @xmath0 , the corresponding mass fraction is somewhat lower .",
    "this is because , once the fast shock has returned to the cloud boundary , the cloud consists of three regions : the region interior to the slow shock , in which @xmath0 is low and the gas is in the thermally unstable phase ; the thin shell behind the slow shock in which @xmath63 and the gas is in the cold phase ; a thin annulus on the symmetry plane in which the conditions are similar to those in the thin shell .",
    "although the thin shell and the annulus contain a significant fraction of the mass , they only occupy a small fraction of the volume .",
    "the annulus is not very significant since it is an artifact of the symmetry of the calculation and would not be present in a more realistic calculation without this symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , a thin shell must appear in any such calculation .",
    "this is interesting since it is likely to break up into dense fragments ( koyama & inutsuka 2000 ) and is therefore a possible site of star formation . in a more realistic simulation which is asymmetric due to an external flow , it would not be as regular as in our simulation and so one might expect star formation to occur on one side of the cloud .",
    "there is a good deal of observational evidence that suggests that high - mass stars tend to form at the surfaces of gmcs ( ( e .",
    "g. israel 1987 ; gatley et al .",
    "1979 : fich et al .",
    "1982 ) . in the case of the galaxy ,",
    "this evidence is not conclusive , but observations of other galaxies may provide clearer results .",
    "for example , there is some tentative evidence from m33 that young high - mass stars are slightly off - set from the molecular material ( pattison & hoare 2005 ) .",
    "the above simulations show the formation of highly magnetically dominated regions in thermally unstable material behind fast - mode shocks propagating through a cloud that is initially in a warm , thermally stable state .",
    "the external pressure variation required to generate such regions is well within the range expected in the mid - plane of the galaxy .",
    "a slow - mode shock follows the fast - mode shock leading to the production of dense regions in which the thermal and magnetic pressures are comparable",
    ". these dense regions may be the sites of high - mass star formation .",
