    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) describes the scale dependence of a wide number of hard processes , up to next to leading order ( nlo ) , and in a few cases up to next to next to leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite .",
    "however , direct comparisons of calculations with experimental cross sections are often affected by the uncertainty coming from non - perturbative contributions , that are less well understood , although exceptional cases exist where the non - perturbative corrections can be deduced from the large distance behavior of the perturbative series @xcite . to this date ,",
    "the mechanisms by which a pqcd description of deep inelastic observables starts failing , giving way to non - perturbative ( np ) behavior , are still largely undetermined .",
    "new studies of kinematic regions , and possible observables expected to be most sensitive to this transition , are currently being pursued .",
    "this paper is dedicated to interpreting a somewhat surprising behavior of the nucleon structure function @xmath1 in the nucleon resonance region , as recently measured at jefferson lab and reported in @xcite , for four - momentum transfers squared 0.45 @xmath4 3.3 ( gev / c)@xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with older , lower precision , slac data , down to @xmath0 = 0.07 ( gev / c)@xmath2 @xcite . at the lower values of @xmath0 , the resonance region ,",
    "typically defined to comprise the region in invariant mass @xmath5 (= @xmath6 + @xmath0(1/@xmath7 - 1 ) ) @xmath8 4 gev@xmath2 , with @xmath9 the proton mass and @xmath7 the bjorken scaling variable , is at low values of @xmath7 , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the resonances do not characterize the large @xmath7 behavior that was extensively studied before , in e.g. refs .",
    "it was , however , found that the resonance region seems to average to a single curve even at these very low values of @xmath0 .",
    "this scaling curve mimics a valence - like quark distribution , the new data of @xcite adding new information for @xmath11 0.25 .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present a low-@xmath0 moment analysis of the inclusive electron - proton scattering @xmath1 structure function data , based upon the new precise resonance region and existing deep inelastic region data , and to interpret these moments in the context of the surprising resonance region behavior of @xcite .",
    "such an analysis would extend previous pqcd analyses of the type performed in @xcite , to the lowest values of @xmath0 and @xmath7 of @xcite .",
    "in particular , as @xmath0 decreases , we expect np effects to dominate the cross section , reducing the agreement with pqcd predictions .",
    "such an analysis may be complementary to the ones addressing another set of low-@xmath0 measurements of @xmath1 obtained recently at hera @xcite , which however belong to a completely different kinematical region , characterized by very low @xmath7 ( down to @xmath12 ) and , accordingly , to very large @xmath13 .",
    "in @xcite it has been found that the structure function @xmath1 can be described by pqcd down to @xmath14 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , provided a gluon distribution vanishing at low @xmath7 ( also referred to in the literature as `` valence - like '' @xcite ) and a non vanishing but small sea distribution , are adopted .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite it was also found that , at even lower values of @xmath0 , @xmath15 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , and in the same very low @xmath7 region , the pqcd description breaks down giving way to different types ( _ e.g. _ regge type ) of descriptions .",
    "the fact that pqcd can be extended to very low @xmath0 ( @xmath16 1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ) was unexpected and supports the idea that the qcd coupling constant might have a smoother behavior at low @xmath0 than predicted by asymptotic freedom expressions . or , in other words , the confinement mechanism might manifest itself in a softer way @xcite .",
    "it is also unexpected from the point of view of a pqcd based analysis that the resonance data , lying on the low side of the invariant mass spectrum , would follow a curve that is not too far from the dis valence quark curve down to very low @xmath0 .",
    "is this still a signature of pqcd ?    in section ii",
    "we remind the reader of the bloom - gilman duality phenomenon . in section",
    "iii we review the world inclusive ( e , e@xmath17 ) data at low @xmath0 , both in the low and in the large @xmath13 regions . in section iv",
    ", we evaluate the moments of the proton structure function in the low @xmath0 region , including the elastic contribution , and we extend the pqcd based analysis of @xcite to this region . in section",
    "v , we discuss the role played by the elastic contribution in rendering the @xmath0 dependence of the moments . in section",
    "vi , we draw our conclusions .",
    "three decades ago , bloom and gilman observed a fascinating correspondence between the resonance electroproduction and deep inelastic kinematic regimes of inclusive electron - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was observed that the resonance strength could be related to the deep inelastic strength via a scaling variable which allowed for a comparison of the lower @xmath13 and @xmath0 resonance region data to the higher @xmath13 and @xmath0 deep inelastic data .",
    "it was observed that the deep inelastic data are apparently equivalent to an average of the resonance region data .",
    "furthermore , this behavior was observed over a range in @xmath0 and @xmath13 , and it was found that , with changing @xmath0 , the resonances move along , but always average to , the smooth scaling curve typically associated with deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "this behavior clearly hinted at a common origin for resonance ( hadron ) electroproduction and deep inelastic ( partonic ) scattering , termed parton - hadron , or bloom - gilman , duality .    a global kind of parton - hadron duality is well established : low - energy resonance production can be shown to be related to the high - energy behavior of hadron - hadron scattering @xcite ; the familiar ratio of @xmath18 hadrons over @xmath18 muons uses duality to relate the hadron production to the sum of the squared charges of the quarks : here duality is guaranteed by unitarity ( in this , one could argue that the @xmath19 production channel exhibits local duality , in that its area averages to about the same global value ) @xcite ; in pqcd the high - momentum transfer behavior of nucleon resonances can be related to the high - energy transfer behavior of dis @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear why duality should also work in a localized region , and even at relatively low momentum transfers .",
    "inclusive deep inelastic scattering on nucleons is a firmly - established tool for the investigation of the quark - parton model . at large enough values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 , with @xmath20 , a precise description of the @xmath0 behavior of the nucleon structure function @xmath21",
    "can be given in terms of a perturbative series in @xmath22 , up to nlo @xcite .",
    "such @xmath0 behavior becomes especially transparent in comparing the high @xmath0 ( @xmath23 10 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ) moments of @xmath1 with pqcd predictions @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the resonance region at smaller @xmath13 and @xmath0 in terms of qcd was first presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , where bloom and gilman s duality was re - interpreted : the integrals of the structure function , performed in @xcite over the energy transfer @xmath24 , were translated into integrals over the variable @xmath7 ( or nachtmann @xmath25 @xcite , in order to account for finite target mass effects ) .",
    "bloom - gilman duality was translated into a correspondence between the @xmath262 moment of the @xmath1 structure function in the low @xmath0 region , characterized by resonances , and in the high @xmath0 scaling region , respectively .",
    "the fall of the resonances along a smooth scaling curve with increasing @xmath0 was to be attributed @xcite to the fact that there exist only small changes in the low @xmath27 moments of the @xmath1 structure function due to power corrections in addition to the predicted perturbative ones .",
    "the appearence of power corrections is interpreted as a signal of deviations of the inclusive cross section from perturbative predictions , which one can envisage as due to the increasing importance of interactions between the quark struck in the electron - nucleon hard scattering process and the other quarks in the nucleon . in inclusive dis",
    ", the operator product expansion applies and power corrections are determined by the matrix elements of operators of higher twist ( dimension - spin ) , which are related to multiparton configurations .",
    "such effects are inversely proportional to @xmath0 , and can therefore be large at small @xmath0 . if they are not , averages of the @xmath1 structure function over a sufficient range in @xmath7 at moderate @xmath0 are approximately the same as at high @xmath0 .",
    "notwithstanding , the dynamical origin of local duality , and thus the reason why the higher - twist contributions , undoubtedly required to construct the coherent nucleon resonances , tend to largely cancel on average , _ even _ at momentum transfers below 5 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , is still not understood @xcite .",
    "in fig . 1 we show an overview of recent high - precision proton resonance @xmath1 data at low @xmath0 @xcite . we also include data from slac at @xmath28 0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath2 @xcite . for the former ,",
    "the systematic uncertainty is estimated to be 3.5% @xcite .",
    "for the latter , due to uncertainties in absolute normalization and radiative corrections , we estimate the systematic uncertainty to be better than 10% .",
    "the solid curves represent , for the different kinematics , the single scaling curve defined by averaging _ all _ nucleon resonance @xmath1 data , regardless of @xmath29 , as a function of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "as one can see the individual spectra , at various @xmath0 , oscillate around this single - curve parameterization .",
    "we emphasize that this is * not * by construction , as the parameterization , at any given value of @xmath30 , is obtained from a range of nucleon resonance data at variant values of @xmath0 and @xmath13 ( e.g. , the second resonance bump could have always been below the scaling curve , while the first above , etc . ) .",
    "our main observation is that apparently nature forces the oscillatory behavior of the various resonance bumps around a scaling curve , which has a valence - like behavior .",
    "this has been studied quantitatively in @xcite where it was observed that the behavior of averaged nucleon resonance data at @xmath31 0.3 , corresponding to @xmath32 0.5 ( gev / c)@xmath2 in the nucleon resonance region , is indistinguishable from the @xmath1 dis behavior , consistent with the findings of bloom and gilman @xcite .",
    "the behavior of averaged nucleon resonance data for @xmath33 0.3 , corresponding to @xmath28 0.5 ( gev / c)@xmath2 in the nucleon resonance region , mimics @xcite @xmath34 data obtained from averaging neutrino and antineutrino dis data @xcite .",
    "the latter , to leading order in qcd , selects the difference of quark and antiquark distribution functions , and is predominantly sensitive to a valence quark only distribution .    increasing from @xmath3 0.07 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1a ) to @xmath3 3 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ( figs .",
    "1h,1i ) the @xmath1 spectra change shape drastically . the low @xmath0 spectrum shows a predominant @xmath35 transition ( we do not show the elastic peak , huge at this @xmath0 ) , and relatively minor strength at larger energy transfers .",
    "this is not surprising , as at these relatively small energy and four - momentum transfers one would expect to predominantly excite the valence quarks . at @xmath0 = 3.0 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ,",
    "on the other hand , one sees that the prominent nucleon resonances are largely reduced , and the inelastic background enhanced .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 in the higher resonance regions is larger than @xmath1 in the @xmath35 transition region .",
    "apparently , a swap of strength has occurred between the various channels as a function of @xmath0 .    to further illustrate how the nucleon resonances seem to follow a valence - like curve",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2 the behavior of the @xmath35 transition region ( here defined as 1.2 @xmath36 1.9 gev@xmath2 ) and the second resonance region ( defined as 1.9 @xmath36 2.5 gev@xmath2 ) for various @xmath0 as a function of @xmath30 , in comparison with the global scaling curve defined in @xcite , and used in fig .",
    "1 . as concluded in refs .",
    "@xcite , it seems that the nucleon resonances slide along one global scaling curve ( note that the apparent difference in scaling curve between figs .",
    "1 and 2 reflects only the conversion from @xmath13 to @xmath30 , for fixed @xmath0 ) .",
    "one can see that , if nature forces the oscillatory behavior around a global scaling curve even at low @xmath0 , the resonance excitation strengths will necessarily grow in the region below @xmath37 0.25 where the maximum of the global scaling curve occurs , and subsequently decrease once the maximum of the global scaling curve has been crossed .",
    "compare , for instance , the behavior of the @xmath35 transition region with that of the larger - mass resonance regions : at @xmath0 = 0.45 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ( solid circles in fig .",
    "2 ( top ) , and fig .",
    "1c ) the @xmath35 transition region strength is large being at about the maximum of the scaling curve .",
    "its strength , as for all @xmath28 0.45 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , is also larger than the higher - mass resonance regions which lie at lower @xmath30 for the same @xmath0 . on the other hand , for @xmath3 3.0 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ( open circles in fig .",
    "2(top ) , and fig .",
    "1h ) the @xmath35 transition region strength is small because it is positioned at large @xmath30 , and smaller than the higher - mass resonance regions that lie at lower values of @xmath30 , but have crossed the maximum of the scaling curve . the smooth curve , to which the nucleon resonance regions tend , determines the momentum transfer dependence of the various nucleon resonance regions , forcing the nucleon elastic and transition form factors to scale like @xmath38 @xcite at relatively small @xmath0 , resembling the @xmath38 scaling as predicted by qcd counting rules .",
    "we now ask the question : can the observed behavior of the averaged nucleon resonance spectra be explained within pqcd ?    in fig .",
    "3 , we show a compilation of the world s electron - proton scattering data for the @xmath1 structure function at low @xmath0 .",
    "the deep inelastic ( @xmath39 4 gev@xmath2 ) data originate from slac @xcite , cern ( nmc ) @xcite , fnal ( e665 ) @xcite , and desy ( h1,zeus ) @xcite . as before we include data in the proton resonance region from slac @xcite and jlab @xcite .",
    "the solid curves indicate the next - to - leading order parameterizations of glck , reya , and vogt ( grv ) @xcite , which use input parton distributions starting from very low @xmath0 values . in the third panel down of fig .",
    "3 , the grv calculation is the grv input distribution at @xmath0 = 0.4 ( gev / c)@xmath2 @xcite , without any evolution , _ neglecting sea and gluon contributions_. as one can see , the proton resonance region data for @xmath0 = 3.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 and @xmath0 = 0.9 ( gev / c)@xmath2 smoothly join the deep inelastic data , and agree well with the grv next - to - leading order calculations , exhibiting the local duality witnessed by bloom and gilman @xcite .    turning our attention to the bottom two panels of fig .",
    "3 , the low @xmath0 @xmath1 data , we are only left with the recent desy data @xcite , some sparse fnal data @xcite , and the nucleon resonance data @xcite .",
    "the desy data exhibit the well - known collapse of the proton structure functions at ( very ) small @xmath7 . one interpretation of this effect is that , at these small @xmath0 , one sees a smooth transition from dis to the real photon point at @xmath0 = 0 @xcite .",
    "gauge invariance requires that , for consistency near @xmath0 = 0 , the structure function @xmath1 for inelastic channels must vanish like @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here the difference in reaching the low @xmath0 region for the various values of @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "4 we distinguish among three different limits ( indicated by the three arrows in the figure ) . for the desy experiments ,",
    "low @xmath0 is established at small @xmath7 by having a large ( @xmath41 constant ) amount of energy transfer @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason , it is expected that this region exhibits similar characteristics as the parton model . for the jlab / slac experiments at @xmath42 0.1 , one reaches low @xmath0 at relatively small energy transfers . if the limit is taken at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath42 0.1 , the resonance data do not exhibit such a drastic collapse with @xmath0 as observed at hera , and they stay fairly constant . in fact , they still seem to oscillate around one @xmath0-independent global curve @xcite , informing us that the @xmath0 dependence of the larger @xmath7 nucleon resonance data is rather shallow .",
    "it is this behavior that makes the scaling curve of figs .",
    "[ 1,2 ] , defined by the world s nucleon resonance @xmath1 data , look  valence - like \" @xcite .",
    "if , instead , one takes the limit at a fixed @xmath13 , by restricting oneself always to the nucleon resonance region ( @xmath43 4 gev@xmath2 ) , then one can see that the nucleon resonances  slide \" down the @xmath7 scale to lower @xmath7 for lower @xmath0 ( _ e.g. _ see the constant @xmath44 = 2 gev arrow in fig .",
    "4 ) , where their strength dies out as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we construct the experimental moments of the structure function , @xmath1 , for the @xmath0 range up to 10 ( gev / c)@xmath2 .",
    "the cornwall - norton moments are defined as @xmath46 and the nachtmann moments as @xmath47 \\nu w_2(x , q^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 = ( 1 + 4@xmath6@xmath49/@xmath0)@xmath50 , and @xmath51 is bjorken @xmath7 for pion threshold .",
    "we add to these integrals the elastic contribution , at @xmath7 = 1 , where @xmath52 @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the proton electric ( magnetic ) form factor . for the proton form factors ,",
    "we use a fit to the world s data by bosted @xcite .    to obtain the inelastic contributions ,",
    "we integrate data like those shown in figs . 1 and 3 . apart from the data shown in fig . 1",
    ", we have added @xmath0 points where additional data were available . for @xmath28 0.6 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ,",
    "we have constrained our search to elastic and nucleon resonance data . for 0.6 @xmath55 4 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ,",
    "we have used nucleon resonance data in combination with deep inelastic data , whereas for @xmath56 4 ( gev / c)@xmath2 we have constructed the moments utilizing both deep inelastic and nucleon resonance models , similar as in ref . @xcite . for the smallest values of @xmath0 ( @xmath8 0.6 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ) , we assume a constant value of @xmath1 below @xmath7 for @xmath13 = 4.0 gev@xmath2 , as only sparse data exists .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "3 , this may not be a bad approximation for @xmath28 0.6 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , especially since the nucleon resonance region data extend down to @xmath57 0.1 , and the integration area below @xmath7 = 0.1 is expected to be small only . to judge the uncertainty in this procedure , we have also integrated the @xmath3 0.2 ( gev / c)@xmath2 data starting at @xmath13 = 9.0 gev@xmath2 ( rather than @xmath13 = 4.0 gev@xmath2 ) .",
    "this changes the second moment by less than 3% .",
    "lastly , in some cases , we used a model to construct data at fixed @xmath0 , rather than allowing for the small range of @xmath0 in the data .",
    "this effect on the second moments was found to be small , @xmath8 3% , and far smaller for the higher moments .",
    "thus , we believe the total uncertainty in the moments we calculate to be less than 5% . we show the values for the second , fourth , sixth , and eigth cornwall - norton ( top ) and nachtmann ( bottom ) moments of the proton , extracted from the world s data , including deep inelastic , nucleon resonance , and elastic data , as described above , in fig .",
    "5 . similarly , tables i and ii list the numerical values of the moments , with the elastic contribution to each separately given .",
    "as expected , the elastic contribution dominates the moments at the lowest @xmath0 .",
    "note that the cornwall - norton moments will become unity , i.e. the proton charge squared , at @xmath0 = 0 , whereas the nachtmann moments will vanish at @xmath0 = 0 , as can readily be seen from eqn .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , with respect to bjorken @xmath7 , the nachtmann scaling variable @xmath30 correctly takes into account the finite proton mass scale @xcite , but does not account for any other significant mass scale ( like the quark masses ) . as the interpretation of the cornwall - norton moments in the @xmath28 1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 region seems more intuitive , and we are interested here in the low-@xmath0 behavior of the moments , we will concentrate on these moments in the remainder of the discussions in this work . to emphasize that there is indeed not much difference between the cornwall - norton and nachtmann moments if one concentrates on the low-@xmath0 region where the elastic contribution turns dominant , fig .",
    "6 graphically displays the relative contribution of the elastic channel to the total moment for both cornwall - norton ( top ) and nachtmann ( bottom ) moments , for @xmath27 = 2 ( solid circles ) , @xmath27 = 4 ( squares ) , @xmath27 = 6 ( triangles ) and @xmath27 = 8 ( stars ) , from tables i and ii .",
    "nonetheless , as the benefit of the nachtmann moments is to push an analysis in terms of an operator - product expansion to lower values of @xmath0 , taking correctly target - mass effects into account , we show everywhere similar figures , for comparison , for the nachtmann moments .",
    "note that one can argue that the relative contribution of the elastic grows slower for @xmath58 0 if one uses the nachtmann moments .",
    "first , let us revisit the large @xmath0 , @xmath59 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , behavior of the moments . at asymptotically large @xmath0 , one can write the non - singlet moments @xmath60(@xmath0 ) at leading order ( lo ) in the perturbative expansion , as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the qcd scale parameter and @xmath63 where @xmath64 = 11 - ( 2/3)@xmath65 , with @xmath65 the number of flavors , and @xmath66 the leading - order non - singlet anomalous dimensions numerically specified in @xcite .",
    "to circumvent the requirement of non - singlet moments we highlight in fig .",
    "7 the @xmath27 = 4 moment : although we use the same @xmath1 structure function data for all moments , the weighting with @xmath67 in these moments will emphasize the large-@xmath7 region , at higher @xmath27 , and thus approximate a non - singlet moment . on the top of fig .",
    "7 we show the cornwall - norton moment , on the bottom the nachtmann moment ( each to the power @xmath68 ) . we show the data in a log - log plot , in order to encompass also the low-@xmath0 region .",
    "the moments are shown both with ( stars ) and without ( open circles ) the elastic contribution included .",
    "the dashed curves exhibit a fit to the data , from @xcite , limited to @xmath56 20 ( gev / c)@xmath2 to minimize the effect of higher order corrections , in the form @xmath69^{(-1/d_n^{ns } ) } \\approx p_1 ln(q^2/\\lambda^2)$ ] . in @xcite ,",
    "this fit gives @xmath70 = 27.46 ( 27.05 ) @xmath71 0.25 ( 0.24 ) and @xmath62 = 250 mev , for the cornwall - norton ( nachtmann ) moment , rendering the expected logarithmic scaling behavior in qcd at asymptotic @xmath0 .",
    "the dot - dashed ( dotted ) curves exhibit a similar fit in the form @xmath72 down to @xmath0 = 2.0 ( gev / c)@xmath2 from the same reference @xcite , thus taking into account power corrections of order 1/@xmath0 and 1/@xmath73 ( 1/@xmath0 only ) .",
    "numerical values for the @xmath74 and @xmath75 coefficients are @xmath76 = 0.33 @xmath71 0.04 ( 0.33 @xmath71 0.04 ) and @xmath77 = 4.69 @xmath71 0.19 ( 1.61 @xmath71 0.15 ) for the cornwall - norton ( nachtmann ) moment ( see also the caption of fig . 7 ) .",
    "one can easily verify from fig . 7",
    "that the magnitude of the @xmath77 coefficient is in this case dominated by the inclusion of the elastic contribution .",
    "similarly , the nachtmann ( @xmath78 ) moment analysis gives a drastically different value for @xmath77 from the cornwall - norton ( @xmath79 ) moment analysis mainly due to the different contribution from the elastic .    in order to illustrate the relative strength of the elastic contribution compared to other @xmath13 regions , we show in fig .",
    "8 the second ( fig .",
    "8a ) , fourth ( 8b ) , sixth ( 8c ) and eigth ( 8d ) cornwall - norton moments for @xmath28 5 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , separated in the elastic contribution ( squares , due to our choice of vertical scale sometimes only visible at the higher @xmath0 ) , the contribution of the @xmath35 transition region ( triangles , 1.2 @xmath36 1.9 gev@xmath2 ) , of the second resonance region ( open circles , 1.9 @xmath36 2.5 gev@xmath2 ) and of the  deep inelastic \" region ( stars , @xmath39 4 gev@xmath2 ) .",
    "the total moment is given by the solid circles , and the curves connect the various data to guide the eye .",
    "the chosen finite @xmath13 regions will start contributing to the moments at low @xmath0 , recovering part of the loss of strength due to the fall - off of the elastic contribution , and then also die off , as the resonances move to the larger @xmath30 side of the scaling curve . the contribution of the @xmath39 4 gev@xmath2 region does not die off , as this is not a finite @xmath13 region , so higher-@xmath13 resonances and/or higher-@xmath13 inelastic background start becoming important with increasing @xmath0 , eventually yielding the logarithmic behavior of the moments prescribed by qcd . as evidenced by the difference between the @xmath39 4 gev@xmath2 contribution and the total moment , the contribution of the region of @xmath80 4 gev@xmath2 is non - negligible up to @xmath3 5 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , even for the second moment .",
    "similar remarks hold for the various nachtmann moments , shown in fig .",
    "we note here also that the behavior of the second cornwall - norton @xmath1 moment we extract is very similar to the behavior in the second moment of the spin - dependent @xmath81 structure function @xcite .",
    "presently we only have sparse @xmath81 data in the nucleon resonance region , for 0.1 @xmath55 5 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , such that we can not verify precisely whether the spin - dependent nucleon resonance data tend to oscillate around a similar smooth curve .",
    "however , the limited data are not inconsistent with such a behavior @xcite .",
    "also , we presently do not have enough data for the longitudinal structure function @xmath82 to verify a similar onset of duality @xcite , although sparse hints do exist in the present world s data @xcite .",
    "our findings , that the moments of @xmath1 show a smooth transition from dis down to @xmath3 0 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , and that the nucleon resonances tend to oscillate around one smooth curve , support the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite that higher - twist effects are small if one looks at the low-@xmath0 behavior of @xmath1 for @xmath83 1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical process of local duality dictates minimal @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 at small @xmath0 ; in terms of pqcd this can be explained if the higher - twist effects are reduced _ on average _ in the nucleon resonance region @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , higher - twist effects must be responsible for the nucleon resonances themselves .",
    "the results for the lower moments of @xmath1 , presented here , show a forced transition from the elastic point to the large @xmath0 limit , supported by the oscillations of the nucleon resonance region around one smooth curve at low @xmath0 .",
    "this smooth curve resembles the deep inelastic data at @xmath83 1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , and higher - twist effects continue to be small from there on .",
    "the extension of a pqcd analysis to very low values of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath84 , is of doubtful predictivity . here",
    "even the low @xmath27 moments are mainly sensitive to the inclusion of the elastic contribution ( as this contributes already close to 10% to the @xmath85 moment at @xmath0 = 2 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ) : a picture in terms of non - interacting quark and gluon degrees of freedom is clearly no longer tenable .",
    "similarly the most plausible interpretation of the behavior observed for the dynamical power corrections , which should represent the initial signature of np effects overshadowing the perturbative expansion , would in fact be that their contribution in the 1/@xmath0 expansion is enhanced at decreasing values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , this contribution can be damped on average if coefficients of different powers are large but with opposite signs , thus causing the cancellation required to make the moment a slowly varying function of @xmath0 only .",
    "these cancellations are evidently of np origin and are at low @xmath0 not easily associated to partonic degrees of freedom in the multiparton correlations .",
    "one has to be careful making further concrete statements .",
    "e.g. , it is often remarked that duality obviously does not work universally , as the @xmath27 = 2 cornwall - norton moment at @xmath86 equals the coherent sum of the quark charges squared , which can not equal the parton model expectation in the bjorken limit .",
    "first of all , @xmath1 is not purely transverse , which casts doubt on drawing too definite a conclusion at low values of @xmath0 .",
    "results of an experiment to measure @xmath87 in the nucleon resonance region are needed and forthcoming @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the moment analysis will at lower and lower @xmath0 be sensitive to a smaller and smaller region in @xmath30 , as the inelastic region and nucleon resonances move to lower @xmath30 and their absolute contribution to the moments diminishes . even in a world without elastic electron - proton scattering , one would , at the lowest @xmath0 , be mainly sensitive to a single resonance transition region , in this case the @xmath35 transition region .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , where we repeat fig . 5 for a world without elastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "it can easily be seen ( figs . 1 , 3 , 8 , and 9 ) that the @xmath35 transition contribution , defined by the region 1.2 @xmath88 gev@xmath2 , becomes more and more dominant at low @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in this world a moment analysis at low @xmath0 would become dominated by the coherent @xmath35 process .",
    "still , _ on average _ the @xmath35 transition region seems to obey duality , in that it oscillates around a similar smooth scaling curve .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the findings of @xcite , the discrete resonance transitions are reminiscent of large higher - twist effects , but on average still seem to cancel to large extent ( although quantitatively perhaps not as well as at higher @xmath0 ) .",
    "the above example is not dissimilar to stating that duality will not work on top of any given resonance peak .",
    "a region over which to average is always required .",
    "furthermore , if one neglects the elastic channel , one will at low @xmath0 be mainly sensitive to the imposed constraint by gauge invariance that the structure function @xmath1 must behave like @xmath40 @xcite . at the values of @xmath7 where the nucleon resonances are visible at low @xmath0 in fig .",
    "3 ( e.g. @xmath42 0.1 ) , the @xmath1 structure function does * not * linearly vanish with @xmath0 yet , as shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , although the @xmath1 strength in the nucleon resonance region has to disappear linearly with @xmath0 below some @xmath89 , one can argue that the behavior of the data is not reflecting this @xmath90 expectation yet .",
    "this indicates that the oscillations the nucleon resonances exhibit around a smooth curve , even down to @xmath3 0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , is non - trivial . as the low-@xmath0 @xmath1 data below @xmath13 = 4 gev@xmath2 predominantly consists of excited nucleon resonances and hardly contributions from inelastic non - resonant processes",
    ", one can argue that such a smooth curve must be close to a curve consisting of valence strength only .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 dependence of the integrated valence quark strength in the grv model @xcite is close to the @xmath0 dependence of the second cornwall - norton moment of @xmath1 .",
    "however , this @xmath0 dependence is predominantly due to the inclusion of the elastic channel .",
    "thus , for a picture such as the grv model to be valid , there must be a separate @xmath0 dependence for the vanishing of the large-@xmath7 strength at small @xmath0 ( governed by the nucleon resonances ) and the growth of the small-@xmath7 sea .",
    "such ideas are very similar as to what has been observed in hadron - hadron scattering @xcite . here , a generalization of the duality picture was introduced , in which resonances were dual to non - diffractive regge pole exchanges , with the non - resonant contributions dual to pomeron exchange . within qcd",
    ", this corresponds to a picture where resonances are dual to valence quarks , while the non - resonant background is dual to sea quarks .",
    "this supports the importance of additional detailed studies of electron scattering in the nucleon resonance region , in a wide range of @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the world s data on @xmath1 , down to @xmath83 1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , are reasonably well described within pqcd .",
    "this includes the nucleon resonance data , which average to an approximate scaling curve , due to local duality . down to @xmath83 0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2",
    ", the nucleon resonance data still tend to average to such a curve . the contribution of the nucleon resonances to the lower moments of @xmath1 dies out at very small @xmath0 as they have moved to smaller bjorken @xmath7 . instead , the moments below @xmath3 1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 are dominated by the elastic contribution at large @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , a pqcd - based analysis of the low-@xmath0 moments of @xmath1 will render coefficients of the higher - twist terms which are predominantly due to the elastic contribution .",
    "local duality seems to hold down to at least @xmath91 ( gev / c)@xmath2 and to prescribe the transition from the kinematic region dominated by the elastic contribution to the region dominated by deep inelastic scattering .",
