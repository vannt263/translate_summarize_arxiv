    "projector - valued ( also called von - neumann ) measurements on a @xmath3-dimensional quantum system are contextual if there is no way of assigning definite outcomes to yes - no tests that might be performed on a set of @xmath4 mutually compatible projection operators .",
    "compatible measurements may have been realized in the past or may be realized in the future ; that is , quantum contextuality is counterfactual by flouting the causality constraint @xcite .",
    "contextuality also encompasses non - locality which requires not only compatible , but also space - like separated tests .",
    "a landmark statement for contextuality is the bell - kochen - specker ( bks ) theorem @xcite , which may be formulated as follows . in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath5",
    ", it is always possible to find a finite set of rays / vectors that can not each be assigned the value @xmath6 ( for true ) or @xmath7 ( for false ) such that , first , no two orthogonal rays are both assigned the value @xmath6 and , second , in any complete basis not all the rays are assigned the value @xmath7 @xcite ; these constraints are sometimes referred to as a non - coloring property of a bks set .",
    "the bks theorem is closely related to bell s theorem which is the statement that local realistic theories are in conflict with quantum mechanics .",
    "it was found that both theorems , viz .",
    "the bks theorem about contextuality and bell s theorem about non - locality , can be given a simultaneous proof provided that the selected uncolorable set of rays is complete ( in the sense made explicit in @xcite ) .",
    "for multiple qubits , the completeness argument means that each ray ( usually represented by a column vector ) is paired with a partner ray ( obtained by inverting the column and flipping the signs ) .",
    "many proofs of the bks theorem rely on magic geometrical configurations involving only operators and parity rules @xcite . along this line of action , the well - known mermin square ( for two qubits , @xmath8 ) and mermin pentagram ( for three qubits , @xmath9 ) were among the first to serve as an operator proof of the bks theorem and bell s theorem as well .",
    "this stems from the fact that the @xmath10 rays originating from the @xmath11 commuting sets in the mermin square , as well as the @xmath12 operators originating from the @xmath13 commuting sets of the mermin pentagram , contain both a ray and its partner , having thus the required completeness . in the same vein of research ,",
    "a four - qubit magic rectangle found by harvey and chryssanthacopoulos @xcite may be used for both an operator and a state proof of the bks theorem , as well as for a proof of bell s theorem . moreover ,",
    "the found magic rectangle is similar to the pentagram ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 15 ) ) , with four operator bases of size five and one of size four ; there are @xmath14 real states shared by these bases and one can find a non - parity bks proof with only @xmath15 selected maximal bases .    in this paper , we extend a recent series of small proofs of the bks theorem @xcite , which were based on real rays / vectors associated with specific sets of two- , three- and four - qubit operators within the corresponding generalized pauli group , to a five - qubit system . the magic configuration that motivated",
    "our study is a particular one from a sequence proposed by aravind for odd hilbert space dimensions @xcite ; see also @xcite . among the novelties we find ( a ) a non - parity proof of the bks theorem with @xmath16 rays on @xmath15 maximal bases , ( b ) a noise - like distribution of the ` hilbert - schmidt ' distances between the bases and ( c ) a remarkable finite geometry underlaid by a hyperbolic quadric @xmath17 of the symplectic polar space @xmath2 .",
    "the magic configuration we start with is a modification of that proposed by aravind @xcite and divincenzo and peres @xcite , namely : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ,  ,",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , similarly for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ,  ,",
    "@xmath26 , and @xmath27 the operators preceding the semicolon in each set of pairwise commuting operators of ( [ bksoperator ] ) multiply to the last one _ except for _ the first set where the first five operators multiply to @xmath28 .",
    "there are altogether @xmath29 operators and each of them occurs in exactly two commuting sets .",
    "since each operator has the eigenvalues @xmath30 , there is no way of assigning multiplicative properties to all the eigenvalues while keeping the same multiplicative properties for the operators ; hence , these five sets furnish an operator / observable proof of the bks theorem .",
    "there are @xmath31 eigenstates associated with the five operator bases in ( [ bksoperator ] ) .",
    "the states / rays in question form @xmath32 maximal bases that exhibit a bicoloring and , hence , do not lead to a state proof of the bks theorem .",
    "for such a proof , we have to pass to a slightly different set ( which , however , is no longer  magic \" ) . in particular , in each of the first four sets of ( [ bksoperator ] ) we drop the observable following the semicolon and in the last set we replace the last observable by a couple of new ones , namely @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 the @xmath36 eigenstates / rays form @xmath37 maximal bases that do not have a bicoloring .",
    "the simplest bks proof we found contains , however , only @xmath15 maximal bases .",
    "we looked at the graph whose vertices are theses 21 bases and edges join two bases whenever they overlap ( in one or several rays ) and found that its automorphism group is isomorphic to @xmath38 .",

    "each of the five aggregates of rays contains a partner aggregate ( not made explicit ) , which means that our bks state proof is also bell s proof .",
    "to arrive at the @xmath1 proof , we randomly selected a small set @xmath42 of bases among the @xmath37 ones such that ( a ) there is at least one subset of @xmath42 containing @xmath13 bases partitioning the @xmath43 rays ( this criterion was simply adopted to reach the desired result with only @xmath44 checks ) , ( b ) the set @xmath42 itself satisfies the bks ` non - coloring ' constraints given in the introduction . applying this methodology in a recursive way , we arrived at the @xmath15 maximal bases which contain a single subset @xmath45 partitioning the rays .",
    "apart from the use of standard graph theoretical tools for characterizing the ray / base symmetries , we can also analyze our sets in terms of the ` hilbert - schmidt ' distance @xmath46 between two orthonormal bases @xmath47 and @xmath48 , defined as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 2))-@xcite @xmath49 this distance vanishes when the bases are the same and is maximal ( and equal to unity ) when the two bases @xmath47 and @xmath48 are mutually unbiased , @xmath50 , and only then .",
    "it has already been found @xcite that the bases yielding a bks proof prefer a particular set / pattern of distances , which we suspect to be a universal feature of such a proof .",
    "for the present proof(s ) , we again observe a good wealth of distances between the maximal bases that exhibit a remarkable noise - like pattern , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "+         in this section we shall provide the reader with a finite - geometrical insight into the structure of the five sets ( [ bksstate ] ) . to this end in view , it is instructive to represent mutual relations between these sets in a diagrammatical form as depicted in fig.2 , _",
    "left_. one first notes that the observables @xmath51 and @xmath52 belong to three different sets , whilst the observable @xmath53 sits in just one set ; all the remaining elements are in exactly two sets .",
    "we shall , however , be more interested in geometry of each set as a whole . in this respect",
    "it is fairly obvious that we have two pairs of sets , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and that set @xmath56 stands on a different footing with respect to each of the two pairs .    to find a finite - geometrical underpinning of this relation , we shall invoke some of the theory of factor - group - generated finite polar spaces expounded thoroughly in @xcite , where the interested reader is referred to look for all the necessary background information and more details ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "all our observables represent elements from the real five - qubit pauli group , whose geometry is that of the symplectic polar space @xmath2 .",
    "this space , roughly speaking , is a collection of all totally isotropic subspaces of the ambient nine - dimensional binary projective space , pg@xmath57 , equipped with a non - degenerate alternating bilinear form .",
    "the elements of the group are in a bijective correspondence with the points of @xmath2 in such a way that two commuting elements correspond to two points joined by a totally isotropic line ; a maximum set of mutually commuting elements of the group having its counterpart in a maximal totally isotropic subspace ( also called a generator ) , which is pg@xmath58 .",
    ".the points / observables of the five pg@xmath58s .",
    "here , for example , ` 123 ' stands for the product of observables ` 1 ' , ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that @xmath59-space and @xmath60-space are in the same system , as are @xmath61- and @xmath62-spaces , the two systems being different ; this accounts for the pairing property mentioned above ( see fig .",
    "we further see that although @xmath56-space lies in the same system as @xmath61- and @xmath62-ones , it has different intersection with each of the latter ; this explains why set @xmath56 has a different footing as well .",
    "one also observes that the three distinguished observables ( see fig .",
    "2 ) are all accommodated by the unique fano plane @xmath63 \\cap [ c]$ ] .",
    "we proposed particular @xmath1 and @xmath0 five - qubit state proofs of the bks theorem , each of which also furnishes a proof of bell s theorem , and studied their essential features .",
    "the ` hilbert - schmidt ' distances between the corresponding maximal bases show a noise - like distribution ; this is quite remarkable especially in the second case , where the graph whose vertices are the 21 bases and edges join two bases whenever they overlap exhibits a relatively high degree of symmetry , @xmath64 .",
    "we also came across a rather counter - intuitive feature that our starting  magic \" configuration of observables ( eq.(1 ) ) does not yield a state proof , and we had to pass to a slightly different one ( eq.(2 ) ) to do the job .",
    "the geometric nature of the latter latter configuration was clarified in terms of symplectic geometry @xmath2 and its refinement , the hyperbolic quadric @xmath17 that is the locus of symmetric elements of the real five - qubit pauli group .",
    "we expect this approach to state proofs of the bks theorem , which combines group - theoretical tools with finite - geometrical reasoning , to be very promising especially for @xmath65-qubits with growing values of @xmath65 , where we surmise the noise - like behavior to be more pronounced and the corresponding finite - geometric underpinning more complex / intricate .",
