    "the quantum theory of fields suggests that an infinite number of degrees of freedom live in the bounded space - time regions . to obtain",
    "a finite dimensional hilbert space one should consider energies bounded above by some value in addition to a finite volume  .    however , there are reasons to suspect that the description in terms of a quantum field theory ( qft ) should break down below some distance scale .",
    "if there is a fundamental cutoff the number of degrees of freedom could turn out to be finite .",
    "finite hilbert spaces are also a consequence of the picture coming from the physics of black holes .",
    "these have an associated entropy equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the horizon area and @xmath2 the newton constant .",
    "if this number can be included in the second law of thermodynamics @xcite , the black hole entropy would represent the maximum entropy of any system capable of collapsing to form the black hole ( assuming this later is stable @xcite ) . thought experiments of this kind have lead to the idea of the holographic entropy bound @xcite .",
    "this means that the entropy of a system enclosed in a given approximately spherical surface of area @xmath1 is less than @xmath0 .",
    "an appropriate generalized version of this bound to arbitrary space - like surfaces and general space - times was proposed by bousso in @xcite , where it was called the covariant entropy bound .",
    "this is as follows .",
    "given a spatial codimension two surface @xmath3 it is possible to construct four congruences of null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath3 , two past and two future directed .",
    "suppose that one of these null congruences orthogonal to @xmath4 has non positive expansion @xmath5 at @xmath3 . then , call @xmath6 the subset of the hypersurface generated by the congruence that has non positive expansion .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath6 is called a light - sheet of @xmath3 .",
    "the covariant entropy bound states that the entropy in @xmath6 is less than @xmath7 .",
    "the covariant bound should be regarded as tentative . however , there are no known reasonable counterexamples .",
    "indeed , the bound can be shown to be true in the classical regime under certain conditions equivalent to a local cutoff in energy , and when the metric satisfies the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this includes a vast set of physical situations .",
    "thus the entropy bounds would lead to a finite number of degrees of freedom proportional to the bounding area .",
    "this is in apparent conflict with the intuitive picture coming from a cutoff in space - time .",
    "if the dataset on a cauchy surface is arbitrary , this later roughly suggests that an independent degree of freedom should be assigned to sets of the order of the cutoff scale on these surfaces , leading to a number of degrees of freedom that increases with the volume rather than the bounding area .    in this work",
    "we explore the consequences of assuming that a finite number of degrees of freedom @xmath8 can be assigned to bounded sets @xmath1 in space - time .",
    "the function @xmath8 can not be defined in qft .",
    "we define it here through a set of very general and physically motivated conditions .",
    "we often use the term number of degrees of freedom in the sense of some logarithm of the hilbert space dimension @xmath9 , what is proportional to the statistical entropy @xmath10 . for a system of independent spins @xmath11",
    "coincides with the number of spins   ( and @xmath12 ) need not be discrete if we accept more general structures than hilbert spaces .",
    "continuous dimension functions can be given to some lattices of projectors of von newman algebras .",
    "these would be type type ii factors in contrast with the type i factors corresponding to hilbert spaces and the type iii factors that form the algebras of operators of bounded regions in algebraic quantum field theory @xcite . ] .",
    "the naive interpretation of the dimension @xmath13 is that it represents the number of independent states that can be localized inside some cauchy surface for @xmath1 .",
    "the function @xmath8 is a real function of space - time subsets .",
    "we will assume that this function is an intrinsic property of the space .",
    "evidently if a set @xmath1 includes a set @xmath14 , then it also contains all degrees of freedom that under some reasonable definition can be said to belong to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , an imperative condition for the function @xmath15 is that it preserves the inclusion order between sets , that is    @xmath16    for any @xmath1 and @xmath14 .",
    "the causal structure imposes that the physics inside the whole causal development @xmath17 of a set @xmath1 must be described in terms of the same degrees of freedom .",
    "the causal development of a set @xmath1 in space - time is the set of points through which any inextendible time - like curve intersects @xmath1 .",
    "a typical @xmath17 set has the shape of a diamond ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "thus , the data on the set @xmath1 for wave like equations determines the variables in the whole set @xmath17 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath18 , but taking into account that @xmath19 and ( [ order ] ) we have @xmath20 .    from now on we will take a more conservative domain for the function @xmath8 , and focus attention on a special class of sets .",
    "these are the ones that have a cauchy surface   is sometimes defined only for sets having a cauchy surface @xcite . ] .",
    "we call a cauchy surface for a set @xmath1 to an achronal set @xmath21 included in @xmath1 such that @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we will not consider the sets like two time - like displaced diamonds @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is because it is possible that the function @xmath15 can not be defined at all for these type of sets since the cauchy problem is not well defined on them .",
    "evidently the data on the cauchy surfaces for @xmath23 and @xmath24 is necessary in order to solve a wave equation , but they are not independent .",
    "the argument we have given for the validity of a causal law for @xmath15 is in terms of degrees of freedom .",
    "the same reasoning can be made for the number of states .",
    "if a state can be localized inside @xmath17 , meaning in a cauchy surface for @xmath25 , then its future or past will pass through @xmath1 , and the converse is also true .",
    "this assumes that states can not be created or destroyed along their evolution and orthogonal states remain orthogonal .",
    "thus , underlying our second assumption is not only causality but unitarity .",
    "the total number of independent states that can be localized on the cauchy surfaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the diamond shaped set in fig.1 is the same .",
    "then the second postulate reads    @xmath28    for an achronal set @xmath21 .",
    "the sets of the form @xmath29 are called causally complete .    with the interpretation of @xmath15 as the statistical entropy @xmath30 it may look strange to assign this number to space - time subsets rather than to subsets of the phase space . however , in theories for wave equations the causally complete sets uniquely determine subsets of the phase space through the initial data on their cauchy surfaces .",
    "this is not the case for sets without a cauchy surface .    at least for globally hyperbolic space - times the bounded causally complete sets coincide with the bounded causally closed sets @xcite ( see section v ) .",
    "surprisingly , these form an orthomodular lattice , sharing this property with the lattice of physical propositions in quantum mechanics @xcite .    thus , up to now we have only asked @xmath15 to be an order preserving function on the sets of the form @xmath29 for some achronal set @xmath21 .",
    "this is not very restrictive .",
    "degrees of freedom located in space - like separated regions would be independent since two operators based in them commute with each other . if we think in a kind of lattice of spins on a cauchy surface , the number of independent spin degrees of freedom simply add for non intersecting subsets of the surface .",
    "states for a union of spatially separated regions can be formed by tensorial product , the dimension @xmath9 then increasing as the product of dimensions .",
    "based on this heuristic idea we can propose the following additivity postulate @xmath31    equation ( [ tres ] ) makes the function @xmath15 additive over subsets of a cauchy surface @xmath21 of a given causal diamond @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 can be written as the integral of a volume form @xmath33 on the surface @xmath21 .",
    "we will focus on strictly space - like cauchy surfaces .",
    "the form @xmath33 at a point @xmath34 on @xmath21 depends on the cauchy surface @xmath21 only locally , that is , it is independent of how the cauchy surface is extended out a neighborhood of @xmath35 on @xmath21 .",
    "thus , a better nomenclature for the forms giving place to the function @xmath15 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is the normalized future directed time - like vector orthogonal to @xmath21 at @xmath35 . to be explicit",
    ", we can represent @xmath15 as @xmath39 where @xmath21 is any space - like cauchy surface for @xmath29 .",
    "the combination of causality and additivity imposes severe restrictions to the function @xmath40 . to see this",
    "let us think in a diamond set @xmath32 of a differential size , so at zero order we can use the flat metric , and assume the function @xmath41 is continue .",
    "let us draw a cauchy surface for @xmath32 using pieces @xmath42 of spatial planes passing through the diamond base faces , and let @xmath43 be the corresponding normal vector to @xmath42 .",
    "the number @xmath44 must not depend on the chosen planes . therefore , at zero order it is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the volume of the piece of spatial plane @xmath42 we used for constructing the cauchy surface . thus , this equation constrains the function @xmath47 for fixed @xmath35 and different @xmath48 .",
    "the result is that the function @xmath47 must be of the form @xmath49 for a vector field @xmath50 .",
    "then the integral in equation ( [ equ ] ) is the flux of a current over the cauchy surface . as the number @xmath51 is independent of @xmath21",
    "the current @xmath52 must be conserved .",
    "resuming , we have that @xmath53 for a conserved @xmath50  ) makes the function @xmath15 a state on the lattice of causally closed sets @xcite . a full demonstration that a conserved current defines a state on the lattice of causally closed sets though the formula ( [ for ] )",
    "can be consulted in @xcite . ] .",
    "thus , it follows that the number of degrees of freedom comes from a conserved current .",
    "this can not be obtained in a general space - time from the metric alone .",
    "in particular it breaks the lorentz symmetry of minkowski space .    assuming finite dimensions , we have that either additivity or unitarity is wrong , or lorentz symmetry is broken .",
    "this seems to correlate with some possibilities to regularize quantum field theories . for finite regularization parameter",
    "the pauli - villars and the higher derivatives regularizations give non unitary theories , and a theory on the lattice is not lorentz covariant .    the reason why additivity fails can be seen more easily looking at fig.1 .",
    "suppose we have a covariant way of assigning degrees of freedom to the cauchy surfaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for example taking the independent spin degrees of freedom to be separated by some spatial distance . then moving @xmath26 to approach the null boundary of the causal diamond its volume goes to zero reducing the number of independent spins .",
    "as @xmath26 and @xmath27 must have the same number of degrees of freedom since they describe the same physics , most of the spins on @xmath27 must not be independent , and the prescription of separating the independent spins by a fixed distance is wrong .",
    "however , the degrees of freedom on the spatial corner may well turn out to be independent when restricting attention to a particular diamond ( a related version of these ideas is in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore if we want to keep the postulates of section ii , and not to break lorentz invariance , we have to give up additivity .    given two pieces @xmath26 and @xmath27 of a cauchy surface @xmath21 such that @xmath54 covers @xmath21 , it is possible that some degrees of freedom are shared between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and then the number @xmath55 will be less than the sum @xmath56 , while the opposite would be more difficult to justify if the knowledge of the physics in @xmath26 and @xmath27 must determine the physics in @xmath21 . similarly , the entanglement of states for adjacent regions in a cauchy surface can lead to double counting the same states @xcite .",
    "the states on the boundary is counted by one or by both , the states restricted to @xmath26 and the ones restricted to @xmath27 .",
    "otherwise some states would escape from @xmath21 . if @xmath57 then @xmath56 @xmath58 would hold for the entropies . what would be surprising is that such entanglement entropy could turn out to be relevant .",
    "let us give place to the entanglement and assume that a subadditive law is valid . if two sets @xmath23 and @xmath24 cover a cauchy surface for @xmath32 then @xmath59    all requirements for the function @xmath15 up to now are conformal invariant .",
    "in fact , they only depend on the causal structure rather than the conformal one @xcite .",
    "for example postulate ( [ dos ] ) makes @xmath15 trivial for some spaces without achronal sets .",
    "let us see more closely the implications of i , ii and iii(b ) for the case of minkowski space .",
    "the poincare symmetry is not shared by conformal transformations of the flat metric .",
    "thus , imposing it will select the minkowski metric .",
    "this symmetry has very strong implications for our function @xmath15 . to see this",
    "let us take a small reference diamond @xmath32 with a cubic base on the surface @xmath60 in a given reference frame and with faces of area @xmath61 . with a boost it is possible to stretch the diamond along a null direction as in fig.2 .",
    "this stretched diamond must then have the same number of degrees of freedom as the original one .",
    "the boosts do not change the size of the transversal dimensions , and the area of the diamond base spatial faces is of course unchanged .",
    "the null line that goes from the diamond tip to the central point in the cubic face is orthogonal to that face .",
    "consider now a space - like surface @xmath3 of codimension @xmath62 and such that its orthogonal null congruence has negative expansion at @xmath3 .",
    "with many copies of boosted reference diamonds , using now rotations and translations to align their spatial faces along the spatial surface @xmath3 , we can cover the whole light sheet of @xmath3 ( see fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "the number of reference diamonds needed is the area of @xmath3 in units of @xmath63 .",
    "each stretched diamond has the same number of degrees of freedom , @xmath64 .",
    "then , using the subadditive property we have @xmath65 where @xmath6 is the light sheet of @xmath3 , and @xmath66 is the area of the @xmath67 dimensional spatial surface @xmath3 .",
    "note that the fraction on the right hand side is independent of @xmath3 as long as this surface is big enough . as shown in fig.3(b ) , the same construction does not work for expanding light sheets because the stretched diamonds separate each other along the null congruence , and their transversal size can not increase since boosts leave the transversal dimensions unchanged .",
    "therefore , we recover all the elements of the bousso entropy bound from these simple assumptions .",
    "the constant relating area to entropy is not determined at this point .",
    "de sitter space is conformally flat and it is also maximally symmetric with symmetry group @xmath68 . then we can use this symmetry group to emulate what we have done for minkowski space . to keep explicit the symmetry",
    "we can represent de sitter space as the hypersurface @xmath69 @xmath70 in 4 + 1 dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the lorentz group @xmath68 manifestly lives this surface invariant .",
    "let us consider the spatial surface @xmath71 , and the sphere @xmath72 given by @xmath73 @xmath74 , or equivalently @xmath75 , on it .",
    "among all the null congruences orthogonal to the 2-sphere @xmath3 in @xmath76 dimensions there are @xmath77 included in de sitter space .",
    "these are also the @xmath77 null congruences orthogonal to @xmath3 in de sitter space .",
    "then , we can use the lorentz boosts in @xmath76 dimensions as we did before to stretch a small @xmath77 dimensional diamond covering a piece of @xmath72 along the null congruence orthogonal to it .",
    "these boosts must be in a direction orthogonal to @xmath3 but parallel to the hyperboloid at the point where the small reference diamond is seated .",
    "using rotations we can transport diamonds along the spatial surface @xmath71 . to transport the reference diamond along the @xmath78 direction we have to use the boosts in direction orthogonal to the hyperboloid at the point where the diamond is located .",
    "the areas are unchanged by symmetry transformations and we obtain again the bound ( [ cota ] ) .",
    "as happens in the case of minkowski space , this procedure can work to obtain a bound as long as the surface is contracting . for positive @xmath79",
    "there is one future directed and one past directed light sheet of @xmath80 for @xmath81 , while for @xmath82 there are two past directed light - sheets .    for spaces with less number of symmetries",
    "it would not be possible to obtain the covariant bound using a single reference diamond as we have done here . in the general case , given a causal structure we have to study the possible solutions to the set of constraints i , ii and iii(b ) .",
    "we remark that this system of inequalities is linear , thus linear combinations with positive coefficients form also solutions .",
    "we will not develop further in this sense here .",
    "instead we go back to the case of minkowski space .",
    "the equation ( [ cota ] ) compared with the covariant entropy bound suggests the interpretation of @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath85 must be used only for the light - sheets @xmath6 with @xmath66 greater than @xmath61 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath86 for the reference diamonds @xmath32 adequated to a given @xmath6 is what should be used to have the strongest bound .",
    "the construction of the preceding section can be generalized to investigate the scaling properties of @xmath64 in a way similar to the renormalization group , but where we have inequalities instead of equations .",
    "the order and subadditivity play opposite rolls in the inequalities , and the poincare symmetry is the tool to use for comparing different sets .",
    "the equation ( [ cota ] ) is obtained by measuring a set using another one and is a special case of these inequalities .",
    "many other configurations could be used to provide different inequalities of this kind .    for example consider diamonds with spatial rectangular base at @xmath60 in a given reference frame .",
    "let us call them @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the side lengths . here",
    "@xmath89 is the space - time dimension .",
    "the diamond @xmath87 can be measured by two copies of the diamonds @xmath90 , .. , @xmath91 , .. , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is smaller than all the other sides .",
    "it is enough to cover with the big faces of the @xmath94 the corresponding faces of @xmath87 and make the boosts in the small direction ( the @xmath95 direction ) .",
    "the subadditive and order properties give @xmath96 there we see that @xmath97 is roughly given by the function @xmath15 of its facial diamonds @xmath98 .",
    "let us choose @xmath99 smaller than all the other sides , which makes the face perpendicular to this side the biggest one .",
    "then we see from ( [ capa ] ) that the function @xmath100 as @xmath93 goes to zero is bounded below by @xmath101 . it also decreases with @xmath93 and thus must converge .",
    "we call to this limit for facial sets @xmath102 we have only rotations and translations as symmetries for the facial sets , since we have run out of boosts",
    ". the function @xmath103 is ordered by inclusion .",
    "the subadditive law implies subadditivity for faces , that is , the sum of the function @xmath103 of the faces that cover a given face must be greater than the function @xmath103 for this face .    covering with copies of a face @xmath104 another face @xmath105 with multiple side lengths , @xmath106 , @xmath107 integer",
    ", we obtain @xmath108 thus , the @xmath67 dimensional function @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the surface area , is a decreasing function in the sense of the inclusion order , while @xmath111 is an increasing function . as a result",
    "the behavior of @xmath112 is bounded between a constant and a constant times @xmath113 .",
    "the area law for entropy appears here as a possibility unrelated a priori to gravity .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath114 as proportional to the newton constant is supported by the work @xcite . there",
    "the entropy was taken proportional to the area and the stress tensor was interpreted in terms of a heat flux across null surfaces . using the second law of thermodynamics as seen from accelerated observers to relate the changes of area with the heat flux",
    "it was shown that the einstein equations for the metric can be obtained .",
    "it also follows the proportionality factor @xmath115 between @xmath116 and entropy .",
    "we think that a rewriting of that work in terms of the function @xmath15 and where the stress tensor provides additional information to the inequalities could clarify the roll of gravity in the present context .",
    "we note two things .",
    "the first is that according to ( [ capa ] ) the ratio @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the surface forming the spatial corner of @xmath32 , is of the order of @xmath112 for an area of the same size .",
    "the second is that @xmath112 can depend on the size and form of the surface .",
    "gravity could be stronger at larger size according to ( [ esta ] ) .",
    "we will leave a more complete analysis of the possible solutions of the system of inequalities for a future work .",
    "but we note that there are two solutions for @xmath15 that are extremal in the sense explained before .",
    "these are @xmath119 for a constant @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in this later case we have to consider only the sets @xmath32 whose null border has positive expansion at @xmath118 ( see the next section ) . a linear combination of solutions with positive coefficients is also a solution , so @xmath122 is a solution . in this case",
    "we have @xmath123 the case of @xmath124 corresponds to a number of degrees of freedom that saturates and does not increase any more with the size .",
    "all sets share the same degrees of freedom and the entanglement is total .",
    "the case @xmath125 is when the newton constant is really constant and the area law for the entropy is valid .    in general both types of solutions",
    "can contribute , and then the picture that emerges is that as we go to greater sizes the term corresponding to a number of degrees of freedom proportional to the area dominates and @xmath114 is constant .",
    "this is a standard gravity with constant @xmath2 . at lower sizes the constant number of degrees of freedom could dominate and",
    "the newton constant would vanish .",
    "the plank scale would increase as we go to smaller scales making impossible to surpass it and leading to a regularization for all other fields @xcite .",
    "this limit is conformally invariant since the number of degrees of freedom is constant .    in a general space - time @xmath15",
    "has to be assigned to diamonds @xmath32 , and being subadditive it is less than the sum of a number proportional to the spatial corner area of small stretched diamonds that cover the null border of @xmath32 . thus we see a reason why @xmath15 would be an additive function on the spatial border of @xmath32 for big sets .",
    "this is because it is the most relevant term in the language of the renormalization group since all other terms have to be subadditive .",
    "the area is the less suppressed of the additive terms on the spatial corner when the curvature is small .",
    "thus , it is possible to imagine that given a causal structure the solution of the inequalities would give an area law , from which to extract the metric .",
    "this later would result composed by two parts , a net of causal diamonds corresponding to some lattice of projectors , and the function @xmath15 , corresponding to the logarithm of a dimension function for the projectors .",
    "the metric would have no sense for smaller diamonds with entropies that are non additive over the spatial corner .",
    "however , as the basic element is the causal structure and not the metric , it seems that a different interpretation for the conformal case @xmath126 is possible .",
    "this implies that the symmetry under scaling of the causal structure of minkowski space is realized .",
    "thus , it is possible that a different metric could realize this symmetry in the sizes where @xmath15 is constant .",
    "a sector of de sitter space with the metric @xmath127 is invariant under scaling @xmath128 .",
    "time translation symmetry is however broken .",
    "according to the causal postulate ii the domain of @xmath15 can be taken as the bounded causally complete sets . as we have mentioned these sets",
    "coincide with the bounded causally closed sets @xcite .",
    "these are the sets @xmath129 satisfying @xmath130 where the spatial opposite of @xmath129 , @xmath131 , is the set of points that can not be connected by a time - like curve with any point in @xmath129 .",
    "the non expanding condition for the null border of the causally closed sets @xmath32 would imply a new restriction to the domain of @xmath15 , since causally closed sets where some piece of the null border is expanding at the spatial corner could not have a well defined @xmath15 .",
    "surprisingly , it seems that this new restriction can be implemented by imposing that @xmath129 is not only closed under the double spatial opposite but also under twice the time - like opposite operation .",
    "that is we would have to consider sets @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the set of all points in space - time that can be connected by a time - like curve with all the points in @xmath129 .",
    "we will call to these sets the observable sets .",
    "the reason for this name is that if an observer can see the whole set @xmath129 then it must see also all @xmath134 .",
    "the set @xmath134 is the intersection of the sets that can be seen from the observers that can see @xmath129 . in this sense",
    "an observer that see two points spatially separated in minkowski must also see the geodesic path joining them , so the points can not be separated from the joining path .",
    "observers here are taken in a time symmetric sense .",
    "the restriction to the observable sets , @xmath132 , is a generalization of the ideas in @xcite .",
    "there it was argued that the sets formed by the intersection of the past of a point in an observer world - line and the future of another point in the same world - line ( causal diamonds ) are the actual sets accessible to observation .",
    "we see that our definition for the observable sets allow also to information exchange between observers .    if a set is observable or not is calculable with the only knowledge of the causal structure . however , the non expanding condition is non conformally invariant",
    ". then these conditions are not equivalent in any space - time .",
    "it is possible that the einstein equations with some energy condition would lead to the equivalence of being observable and having non expanding null border at the spatial corner .",
    "in fact for a spherical surface @xmath135 greater than the horizon in a robertson walker model the corresponding diamond set @xmath32 with spatial corner @xmath135 does not have positive expansion at @xmath135 .",
    "however , the presence of the singularity makes @xmath136 a set without spatial corner .",
