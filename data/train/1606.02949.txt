    "the _ s - matrix _ program is a non - perturbative analytic approach to the scattering problem in quantum field theory ( qft ) , whose origins date back to works by wheeler @xcite and heisenberg @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the program was to overcome the problems of qft related on one hand to the divergences emerging from standard perturbative methods , and on the other to the discovery , in the 1950s and 60s , of many hadronic resonances with high spin .",
    "the idea , further developed by chew @xcite , mandelstam @xcite and many others , was to compute scattering amplitudes and mass spectra without the use of a lagrangian formulation , by imposing analytic constraints on the s - matrix , that is the operator relating initial and final states in a scattering process , and by giving a physical interpretation of all its singularities .",
    "moreover , higher spin particles were treated on the same footing as the fundamental ones .",
    "this latter aspect will be illustrated in these notes when the so - called _ bootstrap principle _ is discussed .",
    "unfortunately , after the initial successes , not many quantitative results were obtained in real - world particle physics . moreover ,",
    "the search for exact s - matrix models was finally discouraged by the coleman - mandula theorem @xcite , stating that qft models in @xmath2 space - time dimensions , with higher - order conserved charges , can only have trivial s - matrices . however , between the 1970s and 80s the program was given a new boost in the context of @xmath3 _ integrable _ theories , whose s - matrices are non trivial and can be uniquely fixed . furthermore , as we will see , knowing the amplitudes for the scattering between two - particle states is sufficient , at least in principle , to reconstruct the correlation functions of the theory , through the _ form factor _ program .",
    "the s - matrix plays an essential role also in calculating the spectrum of integrable theories . both in the large volume approximation , through the derivation of the asymptotic bethe ansatz , reviewed in @xcite , and at finite volume , being the key ingredient of techniques like the lscher formulas @xcite and the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) , reviewed in @xcite .",
    "we believe that this is one of the strongest reasons to study the integrable s - matrix theory , which is the subject of these lectures .",
    "in particular , we will try to describe in a pedagogical way some of the fundamental concepts developed in this research field , assuming that the reader is familiar with the basics of quantum mechanics and special relativity . in order to give a deeper understanding of a few technical aspects , calculations will be described in full detail in some simple cases only .",
    "these tools and ideas can be then adapted to the study of much more complicated systems and the interested reader may find more complete and advanced discussions on the many important applications of such techniques in the quoted references . since we could not cover the enormous literature on the subject , we selected a few reviews and original papers concerning the models discussed in these notes .    in particular , the lectures focused mostly on _ relativistic _ cases and were built mainly on the book by mussardo @xcite , the lectures by dorey @xcite and the paper by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov @xcite . for the important non - relativistic case of @xmath4 , the reading of @xcite , especially chapter 3 ,",
    "is suggested , as well as the reviews @xcite and the seminal papers @xcite , and @xcite for an overview of many other recent developments in the context of gauge / gravity dualities .",
    "the outline of the lectures is the following : after the introduction of the necessary definitions , with a brief description of the s - matrix physical properties , the main ideas underlying the demonstration of the factorization property for integrable s - matrices will be explained .",
    "then we will focus on two - particle s - matrices , including those for the processes involving bound states , and on their analytic and algebraic properties .",
    "a few examples , regarding two - particle s - matrices of the sine - gordon and chiral gross - neveu models , will be given .",
    "the latter theories will be used also to explain the links between s - matrices and correlation functions , through a very introductory discussion on the _ form factor _ program in integrable models .",
    "this part is built mainly on the paper @xcite and the review @xcite ( see also @xcite , the book @xcite and the recent review @xcite , that includes a discussion of the s - matrix in @xmath3 theories and applications to critical phenomena ) .",
    "finally , we conclude with a short guide to the literature about recent developments on s - matrices in @xmath5 correspondences .",
    "it is well known that in quantum mechanics the time evolution of a system can be defined through an unitary operator @xmath6 , which generates the state @xmath7 by acting on a state @xmath8 : @xmath9 in order to study a scattering process , actually , it is not necessary to know @xmath6 at any values of @xmath10 , but it is enough to know it at @xmath11 and @xmath12 . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that interactions among particles occur in a very small region of the space - time , then , very far away from the interaction region , we can treat them as free particles .",
    "thus we need to define in a formal way these quantum states of free excitations introducing the so - called _ asymptotic states _",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of particles , @xmath15 are their momenta and indices @xmath16 label their flavors .",
    "essentially , the asymptotic states describe wave packets with approximate positions at given times : in particular , @xmath14 free particles at time @xmath17 for the _ in _ states and at @xmath18 for the _ out _ ones .",
    "we choose the order of momenta to be @xmath19 .",
    "any intermediate state can equivalently be expanded on the @xmath20 or @xmath21 bases .",
    "the s - matrix is defined as the linear operator that maps final asymptotic states into initial asymptotic states ( or vice versa , depending on the convention adopted , related to the inversion of such operator ) : @xmath22 written in components , this reads @xmath23 where the second line actually involves integrals in @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath25 is the time evolution operator from @xmath26 to @xmath27 : @xmath28 if the system has an hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hamiltonian of the free system and @xmath31 is the interaction part in the interaction ( dirac ) picture , where @xmath32 is the corresponding state in the schrdinger picture .",
    "then a generic operator in interaction picture is given in terms of the operator in schrdinger representation by @xmath33 .",
    "] , then @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath34\\ , ,   \\label{linop}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes the time - ordering for the series expansion of the exponential in ( [ linop ] ) .      in this section",
    "we discuss some general assumptions motivated by physical properties fulfilled by usual qfts .",
    "as previously mentioned , _ interactions _ among particles are assumed to occur only at _",
    "short range_. another obvious assumption is the validity of the _ qm superposition principle _ , meaning that asymptotic states form a complete basis for initial and final states and any _ in _ state can be expanded in the basis of _ out _ states and vice versa , through the time evolution linear operator @xmath25 , as expressed by ( [ eq : sdef ] ) .",
    "moreover , _ probability conservation _ implies that @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are orthogonal , complete basis vectors generating the hilbert space of the asymptotic states .",
    "then one can show that @xmath40 meaning that the s - matrix has to be _ unitary _ : @xmath41 .",
    "we will refer to this property also as _",
    "physical unitarity_. working mainly with relativistic theories , we will be interested in the consequences of _ lorentz invariance_. in particular , given a generic lorentz transformation denoted by @xmath42 , requiring invariance under such transformation at the level of the s - matrix is equivalent to @xmath43 in order to explain the consequences of this assumption , let us consider a two - to - two - particle scattering process , where the incoming ( outgoing ) particles have momenta @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . in a relativistic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theory ,",
    "energies and momenta of the particles involved in such scattering process can be conveniently encoded in a set of relativistic invariants , called mandelstam variables @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 . because of the conservation law @xmath48 and the on - shell condition @xmath49 , then @xmath50 .",
    "hence the amplitude depends only on these lorentz - invariant combinations of momenta , and in particular , since they are not independent , on two mandelstam variables only .",
    "now , momenta and energies can be parametrized respectively as @xmath51 and @xmath52 in terms of the rapidity variable @xmath53 , while mandelstam variables can be written as @xmath54 where we introduced the notation @xmath55 .",
    "then lorentz invariance implies that the scattering phases depend only on the difference of the rapidities .",
    "another fundamental assumption is the so - called _ macrocausality _ , that play a fundamental role in the factorization property discussed in the next section . roughly speaking",
    ", macrocausality tells us that outgoing particles can propagate only once the interaction among the incoming ones has happened , where `` macro '' means that this property can be violated on microscopic time scales .",
    "finally , we will assume the _ analyticity _ of the s - matrices , namely they will be assumed to be analytic functions in the @xmath53-plane with a minimal number of singularities dictated by specific physical processes .",
    "in a qft , the notion of integrability is related to the existence of an infinite number of independent , conserved and mutually commuting charges @xmath56 .",
    "then they can be diagonalized simultaneously : @xmath57 if they are local , _",
    "i.e. _ they can be expressed as integrals of local densities , then they are additive : @xmath58 integrability has dramatic consequences on the form of the s - matrix : in @xmath2 dimensions the coleman - mandula theorem @xcite states that , even with a single charge being a second ( or higher ) order tensor , the theory has a trivial s - matrix : @xmath59 .    in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , instead",
    ", s - matrices do not trivialize . however , integrability is still very constraining and in particular we show that it implies    1 .   _",
    "no particle production _ ; 2 .",
    "_ final set of momenta = initial set of momenta _ ; 3 .   _",
    "factorization_.    points 1 . and 2 .",
    "can be understood as follows .",
    "if a charge @xmath56 is conserved , then an initial eigenstate of @xmath56 with a given eigenvalue must evolve into a superposition of states sharing the same eigenvalue : @xmath60 since we have an infinite sequence of such constraints , these imply that @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , namely the number of particles is the same before and after scattering and the initial and final sets of momenta are equal : in a word , the scattering is _",
    "elastic_.      in order to show point 3 . , that is the factorization of @xmath14-particle scattering into a product of two - particle events @xmath64 we begin by an heuristic argument due to zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "let us consider an @xmath14-particle configuration space ( @xmath65 ) , with particles interacting at short range @xmath66 .",
    "then it is possible to consider @xmath67 disconnected domains where the particles , with a permutation @xmath68 of ordered coordinates @xmath69 and momenta @xmath70 , are very far apart ( @xmath71 ) , so that they can be considered free .    because of points 1 . and 2 .",
    ", the wave function describing the particles in any single domain is a superposition of a finite number of @xmath14-particle plane waves : @xmath72\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath73 being permutations of @xmath74 allowed by the conditions of no particle production and conservation of momenta : basically , the set of momenta can only be reshuffled by scattering .",
    "since we assumed the existence of an asymptotic region ( of free motion ) for any permutation of particles , then the scattering process can be thought as a plane wave propagating from one of these asymptotic regions to another by passing through boundary interaction regions .",
    "thus the propagation path can always be chosen in a way such that it goes through interaction regions where only two particles are so close to interact .",
    "for example , let us take those two particles as particle 1 and 2 , then such region is identified by @xmath75 in this way only one particle at a time can overtake another , until all the particles starting from the configuration @xmath76 have overtaken each other , to reach the configuration @xmath77 .",
    "all the other possible choices of paths connecting the same initial and final configurations , passing also through boundary regions with more than two interacting particles , have to give the same final result for the total scattering amplitude .",
    "not completely satisfied by this heuristic proof , we want to discuss a more rigorous argument , that dates back to @xcite and @xcite . for the reader interested in the details of the demonstration",
    "we refer to those papers and to @xcite , while what follows is mainly inspired by the review @xcite .",
    "demonstrations based on different approaches are given in @xcite and , using non - local charges , in @xcite .",
    "let us start by considering a wave packet @xmath78\\exp[\\mathrm{i}p(x - x_{0})]\\,,\\ ] ] with position and momentum centered around @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "we act on @xmath81 with an operator @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath56 is a conserved tensor of order @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting wave function is given by @xmath85\\exp[\\mathrm{i}p(x - x_{0})]e^{\\mathrm{i}cp^{s}}\\,,\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ @xmath86 , since under a lorentz transformation @xmath56 transforms as @xmath84 copies of the total momentum @xmath87 .",
    "now , the wave packet is localized at a new position @xmath88 , that is where the new phase is stationary ( @xmath89 with @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus the charge with @xmath91 , the total momentum , translates all the particles by the same amount @xmath83 . in the case",
    "@xmath92 , instead , particles with different momenta are displaced by different amounts . in",
    "what follows , actually , we actually only need a couple of conserved charges @xmath56 , @xmath93 , with @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "let us then consider a scattering process with two incoming and @xmath94 outgoing particles : the related scattering amplitude is @xmath95 where the momenta are ordered as @xmath96 . now , the assumption of _ macrocausality _ for the s - matrix essentially tells us that the scattering amplitude is nonzero only if the outgoing particles are created after the incoming ones . in other words ,",
    "the time @xmath97 when the incoming particle 1 collides with particle 2 has to be smaller than the time @xmath98 when the slowest incoming particle ( particle 2 ) interacts with the fastest outgoing particle ( particle 3 ) : @xmath99 .",
    "since the charge @xmath56 commutes with the s - matrix , we can use it to rearrange initial and final configurations without changing the amplitude : @xmath100 this means that , with a suitable choice of @xmath83 , @xmath98 can be made smaller than @xmath97 , and , if any of the outgoing particles is different from the incoming ones , then the amplitude vanishes , following the macrocausality principle .",
    "therefore the only possibility is that one has just two outgoing particles with the same momenta @xmath101 as the incoming ones . with this",
    "we have shown that the scattering has to be _",
    "elastic_.        in order to prove the _ factorization _",
    ", we have to consider processes with more than two particles . in this case , we know now that , acting with a charge like in ( [ fact ] ) , we can separate the trajectories of the particles as much as we want without changing the resulting amplitude , and then also the points of interaction between couples of particles ( which we know now can produce only couples of particles with momenta equal to the incoming ones ) : then the total scattering can happen as a sequence of two - particle interactions .    in other words",
    ", considering the three - particle example , the three types of possible collision shown in figure [ fig : ybe ] can be obtained by suitable actions of @xmath102 with different values of @xmath83 . as all of these commute with the hamiltonian and the s - matrix",
    ", then they have to give physically equivalent processes .",
    "this equivalence is formalized in the famous _ yang - baxter equation _ ( ybe ) @xcite : @xmath103 where for simplicity we labeled the s - matrices just by the labels of the particles of kind @xmath104 involved in a three - particle process .",
    "we can write ( [ ybe ] ) in components in order to show the matrix elements involved in a generic non - diagonal process , where exchanges of flavors among particles are possible , in the following way ( see also figure [ fig : ybed ] ) : @xmath105 the generalization to @xmath14-particle is straightforward .",
    "a four - particle process can be always separated in a three - particle one , for which the ybe ( [ ybed ] ) is already shown , and three two - particle processes , by displacing a particle . then the ybe is proven for four - particle processes . in the same way one decomposes a five - particle scattering in processes involving at most four particles , and so on .",
    "now we can understand better why in @xmath2 the s - matrix of an integrable theory must be trivial : essentially , in @xmath2 it is always possible to move the trajectories of the particles to create equivalent scattering processes where particles are not crossing each other .",
    "from the discussion of the previous section , it turns out that any @xmath14-particle scattering process in integrable theories is completely determined by the knowledge of the two - particle s - matrix .",
    "therefore , in this section , we will focus on general physical properties and the analytic structure of two - particle s - matrices .",
    "following the general definition ( [ sdef2 ] ) , in the case of a two - particle _ elastic scattering _ with incoming ( outgoing ) rapidities @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 . a two - particle elastic relativistic s - matrix is then given by @xmath112 with @xmath113 , and represented graphically in figure [ sdef ] . in terms of mandelstam variables , @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    ", then the s - matrix depends only on one variable , say @xmath116 .",
    "now , we want to answer the question of how to determine the two - particle s - matrix elements .",
    "let us begin from the constraints given by _",
    "discrete symmetries _ usually respected by physical qfts .",
    "if the theory is invariant under reflection of space coordinates , @xmath117 under _ parity _ , it means that looking at figure [ sdef ] from left to right or from right to left has to be equivalent .",
    "namely , the particles @xmath118 and @xmath119 can be exchanged with @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively , leaving the amplitudes unchanged : @xmath122 analogously , the symmetry under _ time reversal _ implies that the amplitude represented in figure [ sdef ] is the same if we look at it from bottom to top or vice versa , then by exchanging particles @xmath118 and @xmath121 , @xmath120 and @xmath119 : @xmath123 if a theory is invariant under _ charge conjugation _",
    ", then we require that the s - matrix does not change under conjugation of the particles involved in the scattering process : @xmath124 where we denoted the charge - conjugated particles by barred indices .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    now , in order to study the _ analytic properties _ of the s - matrix , we recall the definitions ( [ mandel ] ) of the mandelstam variables . from their definitions ( [ mandel ] ) , it is easy to understand that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the square of the center - of - mass energies in the channels defined by the process @xmath127 ( @xmath84-channel ) , @xmath128 ( @xmath129-channel ) and @xmath130 ( @xmath126-channel ) respectively , as depicted in figure [ sdef ] . in a physical process",
    ", @xmath131 has to be real , then @xmath84 has to be in the so - called _ physical region _ , defined by @xmath132 and @xmath133 , _",

    "we begin by imposing _ unitarity _ in the physical region : @xmath137 according to the _ analyticity _ assumption , the s - matrix in the physical region is the boundary value of a function that is analytic in the whole @xmath84-plane , then the unitarity property ( [ physuni ] ) can be extended to the so - called _ hermitian analyticity _ :",
    "@xmath138 adding to this property the time reversal symmetry , we get a stronger condition , that is the _ _ real analyticity _ _ : @xmath139 _ i.e. _ the s - matrix is real for real values of @xmath84 and @xmath140 .",
    "this means , in general , that real s - matrices do not describe physical processes .",
    "another fundamental property constraining relativistic s - matrices is the _ crossing symmetry _ , meaning that the process in figure [ sdef ] has to be read equivalently along the @xmath84- and @xmath129-channels : @xmath141 where , as in ( [ cc ] ) , barred indices denote charge - conjugated particles or anti - particles , that can be considered also as particles propagating backwards in time . in terms of the rapidity , since @xmath142 , crossing symmetry can be written as @xmath143 in particular , denoting by @xmath144 the charge - conjugation operator , crossing symmetry can be written also as @xmath145 note that relation ( [ crossym ] ) involves a dynamical transformation - in contrast to unitarity or discrete symmetries , where only the matrix form is involved - on the rapidity . as we will see in section [ gensol ] and in the examples of section [ examples ]",
    ", crossing symmetry plays a fundamental role in fixing the scalar factors of the s - matrices .",
    "it is a property that profoundly reflects the relativistic invariance of the theory , since it uses the invariance of physical processes under exchange of space and time , _",
    "i.e. _ under rotation of the @xmath84-channel to the @xmath129-channel",
    ".    however , it is possible to generalize crossing symmetry to non - relativistic theories like @xmath5 thanks to its formulation in completely algebraic ways @xcite , that will be discussed in sections [ zf ] and [ hopf ] .    turning back to the relativistic case , we notice that real analyticity ( [ realan ] ) entails @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "equation ( [ rean ] ) means that the s - matrix . ]",
    "has a branch cut between the regions where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are respectively defined , namely there is a branch point in @xmath150 .",
    "this is expected also since that point corresponds to the two - particle threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ it is a discontinuity point of the amplitude imaginary part ( see more details on this aspect in @xcite ) .",
    "because of crossing symmetry , another branch cut starting from @xmath151 towards @xmath152 must exist , as depicted in figure [ anprop ] ( a ) are branch points too . ] .",
    "these are the only two branch cuts if the s - matrix is factorized , since particle production thresholds for more than two particles can not appear .    moreover ,",
    "it is possible to show that the branch cut is of square root type , since unitarity gives @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the s - matrix analytically continued below the cut around the branch point @xmath155 , and then @xmath156 where we used the real analyticity ( [ rean ] ) .",
    "the last relation means basically that a double continuation around the branch point gives back the original s - matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ the branch cut is of square root type .    in order to show in a more concise way the analytic properties of the s - matrix ,",
    "it is convenient to switch from the variable @xmath84 to the difference of rapidities , by inverting the relation ( [ stheta ] ) : @xmath157 then the _ physical sheet _",
    "maps to the strip @xmath158 , the second sheet corresponds to @xmath159 and so on , with periodicity @xmath160 . essentially , the branch cuts of the @xmath84-plane open up in such a way that all the riemann sheets are mapped into strips @xmath161 and @xmath162 is analytic at the images @xmath163 of the branch points . in conclusion",
    ", @xmath162 is a meromorphic function of @xmath53 and its real analyticity implies that it is real on the imaginary axis of @xmath53 .",
    "the main analytic properties of the two - particle relativistic s - matrix can be represented in the @xmath53-plane as in figure [ anprop ] ( b ) .",
    "having discussed the analytic properties of the two - particle integrable s - matrix , let us move to its algebraic features . to do this ,",
    "we introduce a purely algebraic setup , which is fully consistent with the properties studied in the previous section and will be also useful to extend some properties to the non - relativistic case , as explained in section [ sec : nonrel ] .",
    "let us start by defining the creation and annihilation operators of excitations out of the vacuum state @xmath164 , that is left invariant by the symmetry algebra of the particular integrable quantum model under study : @xmath165 in particular , the particles created by @xmath166 have momenta @xmath167 and transform in a linear irreducible representation of the symmetry algebra .",
    "then the asymptotic states ( [ asymst ] ) can be written as @xmath168 .",
    "on the other hand , the conjugated operators @xmath169 generate the dual states @xmath170 the operators @xmath171 are elements of an associative non - commutative algebra , the so - called zamolodchikov - faddeev ( zf ) algebra @xcite . in a relativistic case , ( [ zfasnonrel])-([zfasnonreldual ] )",
    "can be conveniently parametrized by the particles rapidities : @xmath172 for simplicity of notation , all the following equations involving zf operators will be understood as acting on @xmath164 .",
    "defining the asymptotic states in this way allows to interpret the scattering processes as simple reordering of zf operators in the rapidity space .",
    "indeed , writing explicitly the asymptotic states of equation ( [ insout ] ) in terms of zf generators as in ( [ zfas1 ] ) , ( [ zfas2 ] ) and dropping the vacuum states , it becomes @xmath173 that is the commutation relation between the zf algebra elements , and it can be interpreted as definition of the two - particle s - matrix .",
    "the zf algebra is completed by the commutation relations involving the annihilation operators ( [ anndef ] ) : @xmath174 that generalize the usual bosonic and fermionic canonical commutation relations , corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath175 respectively .",

    "the s - matrix does not depend on the difference of rapidities , but separately on the momenta of the particles .",
    "therefore , the zf algebra generalizes to @xmath191 analogously , the ybe ( [ ybed ] ) becomes @xmath192 and the physical properties discussed in section [ proprel ] can be derived using the properties of the zf algebra .",
    "for example , relations similar to ( [ zfcrkl ] ) and ( [ unishow ] ) lead to the braiding unitarity condition @xmath193 together with relations analogous to ( [ zfhcr2 ] ) and ( [ zfhcrperm ] ) , ( [ nonrelbu ] ) gives the physical unitarity condition @xmath194 furthermore , the properties of the asymptotic states under transformations of parity and time reversal , respectively denoted by @xmath195 and @xmath35 , @xmath196 written in terms of zf operators as @xmath197 allow us to generalize the discrete symmetries listed in section [ proprel ] for the relativistic case in the following way ( see chapter 3 of @xcite for further details on the derivation ) :    * _ parity _ : @xmath198 , * _ time reversal _ : @xmath199 ,    while the symmetry under _ charge conjugation _ translates trivially to the condition @xmath200 or , using the charge - conjugation operator @xmath144 , @xmath201 where @xmath202 .",
    "although _ crossing symmetry _ is a property that emerges naturally in the context of relativistic scattering theories and at a first approach its generalization to systems where time and space can not be exchanged might seem impossible , it can be recovered , as all the other properties discussed above , from an additional requirement on the zf algebra @xcite .",
    "basically , we recall that in the relativistic case the crossing transformation entails an exchanging of a particle with an anti - particle and a kinematic map @xmath203 on the rapidity of the conjugated particle .",
    "this translates to the maps @xmath204 and @xmath205 on the momentum and energy of a non - relativistic particle .",
    "then the zf generators must transform as @xmath206 requiring that the commutation relations ( [ zfcrnonrel1])-([zfcrnonrel3 ] ) are invariant under this transformation implies @xmath207 which are the crossing symmetry relations for a non - relativistic two - particle s - matrix .      turning back to relativistic s - matrices ,",
    "we want to show here how they can be completely determined using their analytic properties and symmetries .",
    "first of all , the ybe can determine the ratios between s - matrix elements that belong to the same mass multiplet .",
    "thus , a general solution of the ybe can be written as @xmath208 where @xmath66 is the matrix of the ratios between amplitudes fixed by the ybe , @xmath209 and @xmath210 are meromorphic functions of @xmath53 .",

    "show that @xmath66 satisfies @xmath211 ( from the commutation relation of the zf algebra ) .",
    "2 .   using the previous relation and the ybe ( [ ybed ] ) ,",
    "show that @xmath212 and that the braiding unitarity reduces to @xmath213    rescaling the rapidity by an arbitrary constant @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) , @xmath66 is still solution of the ybe and , for a suitable choice of @xmath214 , in all the known cases it satisfies @xmath216 then the crossing symmetry reduces to @xmath217    therefore @xmath218 is fixed by ( [ unif ] ) and ( [ crossf ] ) up to a function @xmath219 , called the cdd factor after castillejo - dalitz - dyson @xcite , satisfying @xmath220 this ambiguity corresponds to the freedom to add zeros and poles with period @xmath160 to @xmath218 , due to the infinite discrete set of solutions for @xmath221 , in general .",
    "so , if we denote as @xmath222 the solution of ( [ unif ] ) and ( [ crossf ] ) with minimal number of poles and zeros , then the general solution for @xmath209 is @xmath223 .",
    "another fundamental restriction for generic s - matrix elements is the invariance under the symmetry algebra of the model under study .",
    "the corresponding constraints can be derived by acting with the symmetry generators @xmath224 , where @xmath225 runs from 1 to the dimension of the symmetry algebra , on the zf relations ( [ zfcr ] ) : @xmath226 the action of @xmath224 on the two - particle states is given by @xmath227 where @xmath228 are the matrix elements of the two - particle generator @xmath229 , that acts on the two - particle spaces as @xmath230 .",
    "thus , the s - matrix invariance can be written in matrix form as @xmath231 summarizing , the steps necessary to compute the s - matrix in an integrable theory are the following :    * determine the structure of the s - matrix by imposing invariance under the symmetry generators ( by solving the equations given by the condition ( [ syminv ] ) ) ; * find the ratios between the remaining undetermined s - matrix elements by imposing the ybe ( [ ybe ] ) ; * fix the remaining ( minimal ) overall scalar factor , up to cdd factors , by imposing unitarity and crossing symmetry .",
    "we will see some detailed application of this algorithm in few particular cases ( sine - gordon , @xmath0 and @xmath1 chiral gross - neveu models ) , which are discussed in section [ examples ] .    in the non - relativistic example of @xmath232 , for instance",
    ", the s - matrix for the fundamental excitations was determined in @xcite , up to a scalar factor , imposing invariance under two copies of centrally extended @xmath233 symmetry algebras .",
    "such s - matrix turned out to satisfy identically the ybe , while the crossing symmetry condition , implemented in @xcite and @xcite through the algebraic frameworks illustrated respectively in the previous section and in section [ hopf ] , led to an equation for the scalar factor , that was solved in @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .      while elastic scattering essentially means that the set of outgoing particles is identical to the incoming one ,",
    "_ purely elastic scattering _ is further constrained by not having reflection between particles .",
    "so , particles can be just transmitted and the s - matrix is _ diagonal _ : @xmath234 the ybe is identically satisfied and the system of equations of unitarity and crossing symmetry is solved by a function @xmath162 with period @xmath235 , given by @xcite @xmath236 with @xmath237 belonging to a subset @xmath238 of @xmath239 invariant under complex conjugation . indeed one can easily verify that @xmath240 for any complex @xmath237 .",

    "anyway , unitarity and crossing are not sufficient to fix the sets of poles / zeros @xmath238 of @xmath249 or @xmath250 .",
    "we will see in the next section how it is actually possible to fix them .",

    "thus , at the value @xmath275 , with @xmath257 , ( [ schrsol ] ) gives a physically admissible solution , @xmath117 decreasing to zero at large distances , with just outgoing waves and not incoming ones : it corresponds to a bound state .    - and @xmath277-plane.,width=566 ]    moreover , considering the time evolution of ( [ schrsol ] ) @xmath278 we see that no solutions can exist with @xmath279 ( @xmath280 ) , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , since ( [ timev ] ) would increase exponentially with time in some channel .",
    "this would contradict the conservation of probability , then there are no poles of the s - matrix with non - vanishing real part in the upper half plane of @xmath119 .",
    "poles of the s - matrix with negative imaginary part lead still to unphysical states , since the corresponding amplitude increase exponentially in a given channel , but such divergences at large distances are compensated by exponential decreasing amplitudes in another channel , giving an overall conservation of probability .",
