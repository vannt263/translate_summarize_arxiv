    "the time - evolution operator for n - periods is the nth power of the time - evolution operator for one period : u(n t ) = ( -i _ 0 ^tdt  h(t)/ ) = u(t)^n it is therefore natural to define an effective hamiltonian , @xmath18 , such that u(t)= ( -i h_efft/ )    in analogy to describing the labeling of bloch states as  quasi - momentum \" , the eigenvalues of @xmath18 are  quasi - energies \" .",
