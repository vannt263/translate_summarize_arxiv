    "however , cooper pair with finite center - of - mass momentum may also exist in the presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "this consideration led to an exotic superconductor with inhomogeneous order parameter in real space , known as fulde - ferrell @xcite and larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phases @xcite .",
    "there are two types of fflo phases : phase modulated ff state and spatial modulated lo state . in the past two decades ,",

    "each one of these signs of pfaffians changes with the energy gap closing and reopening at the corresponding point .",
    "we calculate the chiral edge states , whose wave functions are spatially localized at the edges in open boundary situation , which can help us to confirm that the bulk is in a topologically nontrivial state .",
