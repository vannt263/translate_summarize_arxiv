    "the collider facilities such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and astrophysical experiments are two main tools for exploring new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . recently , the plank collaboration , designed to detect the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy and polarization , has reported the latest value of tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 at @xmath7 cl @xcite .",
    "this data excludes a few well known inflation models such as quadratic inflation , but still allows some simple examples such as starobinsky - like inflation @xcite , @xmath8-attractor inflation @xcite and higgs inflation @xcite .    among these survivors ,",
    "higgs inflation is rather special due to two considerations .",
    "firstly , there is only one new parameter @xmath0 in this model in the lagrangian in this model , which reads as in the jordan frame , @xmath9 here , @xmath0 measures the non - minimal coupling between higgs scalar @xmath10 and gravity .",
    "it was found that the higgs scalar potential @xmath11 in the einstein frame rapidly approaches to a plateau potential in the large field region @xmath12 , and the model predicts that for e - foldings number @xmath13 , @xmath14 which is in perfect agreement with the plank 2015 data @xcite . in terms of the present cosmological data",
    "@xmath15 in eq.([lagrangian ] ) approximates to the reduced plank mass @xmath16 gev for our present universe .",
    "moreover , unlike starobinsky - like inflation or @xmath8-attractor inflation , it is obvious that higgs inflation is of special interest from the viewpoint of particle physics .",
    "unfortunately , there are two subjects against the higgs inflation .",
    "the first subject shows that the sm is not valid above scale @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it implies that the plateau potential @xmath17 at large field value @xmath12 may be significantly modified by the ultra - violet completion so that realistic inflation driven by the higgs field can not occur at all .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite that a scale symmetry in the ultra - violet completion may be the prescription to this problem .",
    "the second subject arises since the discovery of the higgs mass @xmath18 gev @xcite , which implies that the sm higgs quartic coupling @xmath19 at the weak scale is not large enough so that @xmath20 above the high - energy scale @xmath21 gev .",
    "the uncertainty about this critical scale mainly arises from the the uncertainty of top quark mass , as the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for @xmath19 is very sensitive to the top yukawa coupling .",
    "obviously , positive @xmath19 is required during inflationary epoch .",
    "this problem can be solved through introducing some new fields into the sm , which give rise to either correct threshold correction to @xmath19 or slowing down the rg evaluation for @xmath19 along high energy scale , see , .e.g .",
    ", @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we consider saving the higgs inflation with high - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "high - scale susy can provide the observed higgs mass at the lhc and stable dm candidate @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of such models at colliders is unpromising . in this sense",
    "the astrophysical probe is an important direction .",
    "fortunately , they can be probed directly or indirectly in the light of the cosmological observations on the early universe @xcite .",
    "we identify the cut - off scale @xmath22 as the typical mass scale @xmath23 in the susy mass spectrum . above the scale @xmath24 supergravity",
    "is the natural ultra - violet ( uv ) completion , and for the matter content same as the next - to - minimal susy model ( nmssm ) it may maintain the plateau potential @xcite . for earlier discussions , see @xcite . on the other hand , the susy dark matter ( dm ) , whose mass is around the weak scale , is the natural choice on the new fields added to the sm below the cut - off scale @xmath23 . in this paper",
    ", we consider two possibilities @xcite , where wino @xmath25 and higgsino / singlino mixing state serves as the dm , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the rge for @xmath19 in two classes of high - scale susy below scale @xmath23 . in section iii , we discuss embedding the higgs inflation to supergravity , where we uncover the constraint on parameters @xmath19 and @xmath0 at the end of inflation @xmath26 arising from the present cosmological data . in section iv , we discuss the constraint on the susy mass spectrum in terms of the constraint on the threshold correction to @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section v.",
    "below the scale @xmath23 , the effective theory is described by the sm together with either wino - like or higgsino / singlino - like dm . in this section",
    "we use the 2-loop rges for relevant couplings for our analysis .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix in our previous work @xcite , where the 2-loop rges for sm gauge and yukawa couplings , and higgs quartic coupling in models of sm@xmath27 and sm@xmath28 are explicitly shown .",
    "we ignore other sm yukawa couplings in the following discussion . for the calculation of beta functions ,",
    "see the references therein .     in the sm ( black )",
    ", sm@xmath27 ( blue ) and sm@xmath28 ( green ) , respectively .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the central value @xmath29 gev , @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 .",
    "the dotted lines show the uncertainty due to the top quark mass with 1@xmath32 deviation . in the model of sm@xmath28",
    ", we have chosen small value @xmath33 .",
    "see the text for the reason for this choice.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    fig.[lambda1 ] shows the rg running for @xmath19 in high - scale susy discussed in this letter , which is modified by the susy dm ( wino or higgisno - singlino mixing state ) with mass of weak scale in compared with the sm . in this figure ,",
    "black , blue and green curves corresponds to the sm , sm@xmath27 , and sm@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the solid lines refer to the central value @xmath29 gev , @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 , while the dotted lines show the uncertainty due to the top quark mass with 1@xmath32 deviation . from fig.[lambda1 ] we observe that more positive @xmath19 is obtained in high - scale susy with wino dm for smaller top quark pole mass @xmath34 gev along rg running to scale @xmath2 .",
    "this is mainly due to the correction to the sm beta function @xmath35 induced by the wino dm .",
    "unlike the case with wino dm , the sign of the correction induced by higgsino / singlino dm is only positive when model parameter @xmath36 is small .",
    "otherwise , for large @xmath37 the sign of the correction will reverse and @xmath19 will be negative more rapidly along rg running to scale @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the correction in this case is upper bounded .",
    "but with @xmath29 gev and @xmath18 gev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    fig.[lambda2 ] shows the sensitivity of the rg running for @xmath19 to the higgs mass .",
    "one finds that for about @xmath38 gev deviation to the central value @xmath30 gev the correction in each case is tiny . among the three models",
    ", @xmath19 approaches to zero mostly in the case with wino dm , similarly to what fig.[lambda1 ] indicates .    in summary , for about @xmath39 deviation to the central value of top quark mass ,",
    "@xmath19 is tuned to be more positive in high - scale susy with the low - energy theory below scale @xmath2 described by either sm@xmath27 or sm@xmath40higgsino / singlino dm in compared with the sm . as we will see in the next section , more positive @xmath19 at scale @xmath2",
    "is favored by the higgs inflation . because the threshold correction at scale @xmath2 , may be unable to tune @xmath19 into a positive parameter above this scale as required by higgs inflation .",
    "we proceed to discuss the constraint arising from the condition of plateau potential for higgs scalar in the context of supergravity , which is automatically the ultra - violet completion . for this purpose , we focus on the scalar - gravity part of supergravity lagrangian , which is defined by the frame function @xmath41 , kahler potential @xmath42 and superpotential @xmath43 .",
    "we use @xmath44 to label the chiral superfields including the two higgs doublets @xmath45 .",
    "we follow the notation and conventions in @xcite , where the kahler potential and frame function are given by in unit of plank mass , @xmath46 given the explicit form of these functions , the scalar potential in the einstein frame is directly derived from the well - known formula , . ]",
    "@xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 represents the d - term contribution .    the first attempt to embedding higgs inflation into supergravity",
    "was shown in @xcite . in the light of @xcite",
    "there are two important observations .",
    "@xmath50 , the supergravity version of eq.([lagrangian ] ) requires a holomorphic function @xmath51 in order to reproduce the @xmath0-term .",
    "@xmath52 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "@xmath53 , the matter content of mssm is not viable for the higgs inflation . by following this line ,",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed that the matter context of nmssm is a realistic choice , in which the potential in the nmssm depends on three complex superfields , @xmath54 , as long as the scalar @xmath55 in the singlet superfiled @xmath56 can be stabilized at @xmath57 and @xmath58-flat condition @xmath59 is satisfied .",
    "this idea was firstly considered in @xcite , but a new @xmath60-term should be added to the frame function @xcite for stabilizing the @xmath55 scalar .    in summary ,",
    "the frame function and superpotential for the purpose of higgs inflation are given by , respectively , @xmath61 substituting eq.([frame2 ] ) into eq.([potential ] ) gives rise to the potential , @xmath62 for @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",
    "here we have used @xmath63 . for more details about the stabilization of @xmath55 and angles in eq.([z ] ) , see @xcite . in the region",
    "@xmath64 , eq.([potential2 ] ) approaches to @xmath65 ( in unit of plank mass ) , which verifies our statements above .",
    "moreover , in terms of eq.([potential2 ] ) one can also verify eq.([nr ] ) .",
    "parameters @xmath0 and @xmath19 in eq.([lagrangian ] ) are related to parameters @xmath52 and @xmath66 in eq.([frame2 ] ) as , @xmath67 here @xmath68 denotes the rg scale corresponding to inflation .",
    "they are constrained by the present cosmological data as follows .",
    "recall that @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the amplitude of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation and @xmath71 in the context of single field inflation . for @xmath72",
    "as reported by plank collaboration @xcite one obtains , @xmath73",
    "until now , we have obtained the value of @xmath19 below the rg scale @xmath74 ( as shown in fig.[lambda1 ] and fig .",
    "[ lambda2 ] ) and above the rg scale @xmath75 ( as shown in eq.([constraint ] ) ) given a choice on @xmath0 .",
    "the effective theory at the intermediate scale between scale @xmath2 and @xmath75 is described by the sm together with gauginos and squarks .",
    "other susy particles such as higgsinos and charged higgs have masses of order @xmath75 @xcite , so they should be integrated out at this intermediate energy scale @xcite , especially for the discussion about rge for @xmath19 .",
    "the threshold correction @xmath76 at scale @xmath77 arising from integrating out gauginos and squarks can be determined in terms of the differences between the values of @xmath19 below and above scale @xmath77 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 refers to the gluino mass , bino mass and squark masses , respectively .",
    "as we will see below , the threshold correction @xmath83 can be measured in high precision , so it is a new and useful factor to constrain the gut - scale susy mass spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath84 in eq.([threshold1 ] ) is determined by the rge for @xmath35 in the effective theory at the intermediate scale , with the boundary value at the end of inflation    @xmath85    here , we have ignored the effects due to higgsino - induced operators with mass dimension higher than four , which are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the threshold correction in our case . with mass dimension six ,",
    "as induced by heavy susy particles with mass @xmath15 , contribute to the leading corrections to the rges for sm ew gauge coupling @xcite . as a result",
    ", they modify the rge for @xmath86 indirectly , the significance of which is determined by the ratio @xmath87 , as seen from the modified beta function to sm gauge coupling , @xmath88 . for the three stages we set in this paper ,",
    "the modification to the rge for @xmath86 during inflation is the maximal , with heavy susy particle identified as @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , the modification after inflation is only mild . in our case , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which implies that this modification is smaller than the threshold correction @xmath92 . ]    the threshold corretion @xmath93 in eq.([bound ] ) arises from the heavy higgsinos and singlet @xmath55 , which are given by , respectively @xcite , @xmath94 where we have assumed that the a - term @xmath95 is smaller than @xmath96 . substituting the stabilized value @xmath59 into eq.([values ] )",
    "we find that @xmath97 .",
    "as long as the mass scale @xmath98 , which is of order @xmath75 , is far larger than the hubble parameter @xmath99 and the reheating temperature after inflation @xcite , @xmath100 rapidly approaches to the stabilized value during and after inflation .",
    "the matter content of the effective theory at the intermediate scale is composed of sm fermions , squarks , gauginos and electrically neutral scalars in the higgs sector .",
    "the beta function coefficients @xmath101 for the sm gauge coupling in this effective theory are given by , respectively , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the number of sm fermion generations . in terms of eq.([rges ] ) and one - loop rges for @xmath19 and sm top yukawa coupling we show in fig.[threshold ] the constraint on the magnitude of @xmath83 for the range @xmath104 .",
    "it is shown that the value for @xmath83 as required by higgs inflation is very sensitive to parameter @xmath0 .    in the light of fig.[threshold ]",
    "we conclude that for small non - minimal coupling @xmath1 , the threshold correction at scale @xmath2 induced by higgs inflation is about @xmath105 and @xmath106 in wino and higgsino / singlino dm , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties mainly arise from the uncertainty of top quark pole mass . in the large @xmath0 region with @xmath107 , the required threshold correction is @xmath108 , which is too large to exclude such models .     in the wino dm model .",
    "we have chosen @xmath34 gev , @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 .",
    "similar plot can be obtained for the case with higgsino / singlino dm.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "so far we have only discussed the constraint on the threshold correction @xmath109 at scale @xmath2 in the case for wino dm . in the case for higgsino / singlino dm",
    "the one - loop rges for relevant couplings at the intermediate scale are the same as in section iv .",
    "so the conclusion there is also applied to the model of higgsino / singlino dm .",
    "actually , given the same @xmath0 it is expected that the threshold correction for the case with higgsino / singlino dm is larger than what is shown in fig.[threshold ] .    one may wonder whether adopting larger @xmath110 than @xmath111 gev can reduce the threshold correction in fig.[threshold ] @xmath112 fig.[lambda1 ] and fig.[lambda2 ] have shown that @xmath113 becomes more negative when one chooses larger @xmath110 , and the value of @xmath114 , which is positive , will be smaller simultaneously .",
    "therefore the deviation to the threshold correction is not too obvious to violate our conclusions .    in summary",
    ", the answer to the question whether higgs inflation can be saved by high - scale susy critically depends on the magnitude of @xmath0 . for small non - minimal coupling @xmath1",
    ", the threshold correction at scale @xmath2 required by higgs inflation is constrained in high precision , the magnitude of which is about @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the wino and higgsino / singlino dm , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties mainly arise from the uncertainty of top quark pole mass .",
    "this amount of threshold correction can be explained , for example , for universal squark masses @xmath115 with vanishing @xmath116 terms . for large @xmath117 ,",
    "the required threshold correction is smaller than @xmath118 , which excludes such high - scale susy .",
    "finally , we believe our analysis can be applied to split susy , although this model is more complicated in compared with what have been discussed here .",
