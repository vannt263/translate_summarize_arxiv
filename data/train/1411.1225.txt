    "during the last few years there has been considerable interest in the search for majorana bound states ( mbs),@xcite partly because they have a unique capability for so - called topological quantum computation.@xcite some systems believed to host mbs include the @xmath0 fractional quantum hall state,@xcite p - wave superconductors,@xcite topological insulators coupled to s - wave superconductors,@xcite and two - dimensional electron gases with strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , coupled to s - wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field.@xcite a slight twist to the two - dimensional electron gas proposal is to realize mbs in one - dimensional semiconductor nanowires with strong soi and large g - factors , which can be coupled to a superconductor simply by fully or partially covering the wire with a superconducting material.@xcite we will focus here on the nanowire system .",
    "this research was originally driven by theoretical efforts , but has very recently also attracted the attention of several experimental groups . in order to detect the mbs which are possibly realized in such experiments ,",
    "several types of hybrid devices have been fabricated , such as superconductor - normal metal ( s - n ) structures,@xcite superconductor - quantum dot - normal metal ( s - qd - n ) structures,@xcite and superconductor - quantum dot - superconductor ( s - qd - s ) structures@xcite ( where the s electrode(s ) are made from a nanowire covered with a superconductor and ( possibly ) hosts the mbs ) .",
    "mbs can then be detected by driving a current from one side to the other ( tunnel spectroscopy ) , where the presence of a mbs gives rise to a zero bias peak ( zbp ) in the conductance .",
    "such zbps have indeed been experimentally observed.@xcite however , zbps can also appear for many other reasons@xcite and more evidence of mbs is needed . in devices with two superconducting leads the @xmath1 periodic dc josephson effect has been theoretically predicted to serve as a signature of mbs@xcite and although this has not yet been observed experimentally , there has been reports of unusual current - phase relations@xcite and fractional ac josephson effect@xcite which might also indicate the presence of mbs .",
    "calculations have shown that in a topological weak link between two trivial superconductors the existence of mbs changes the subgap features related to multiple andreev reflection ( mar)@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown theoretically that mar in a weak link between two superconductors in the topological phase ( i.e. , hosting mbs ) could cause novel subgap structures different from the trivial case,@xcite which can also be regarded as signatures of mbs .    in this paper , we investigate a s - qd - s setup .",
    "nanowires as links between two superconducting leads were experimentally realized almost a decade ago  @xcite ( although these studies did not aim to realize mbs ) and it was shown that the supercurrent can be controlled by a gate voltage .",
    "we investigate instead a voltage - biased junction and , assuming that the qd level can be controlled by a gate voltage , we calculate the full stability diagram , i.e. , the nonlinear differential conductance as a function of gate and bias voltage . to this end , we calculate the time - averaged ac josephson current and differential conductance ( @xmath2 ) using the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method .",
    "we show that the stability diagram looks completely different when the superconducting electrodes host mbs compared to the case without mbs .",
    "this allows detection of mbs through the qualitative appearance of the entire stability diagram , rather than just from a zero - bias peak which is more likely to arise for other reasons . to complement the calculations ,",
    "we develop a simple pictorial view of multiple andreev reflection ( mar ) in s - qd - s junctions and analyze and explain how this changes when mbs are present .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our setup and model .",
    "the leads can be driven into a topological phase with mbs appearing at the edges next to the qd , giving rise to novel majorana - related signals in the conductance .",
    "the details of the calculation can be found in the appendix .",
    "the main results are presented in sec .",
