    "* background . * in view of applications like quantum ram or charge - coupled devices , burgarth and giovannetti @xcite introduced a protocol for arbitrarily control networks of coupled spin 1/2 quantum particles ( for example , an array of trapped ions ) .",
    "an important feature of the protocol lies on the ability of transforming the physical state of the entire network , by acting sequentially with the same local operation on a specific subset of particles .",
    "this is valuable , since physical operations on quantum objects are generally difficult to implement .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a network can be prepared in an arbitrary state by acting on the particles of a subset , only if that subset satisfies certain conditions related to the eigensystem of the hamiltonian .",
    "such conditions can be lifted from the physical scenario and analyzed in a purely combinatorial setting .",
    "this can be described in what follows as a discrete - time dynamical process on graphs .",
    "* definition .",
    "* let @xmath5 be a simple undirected graph with @xmath6 .",
    "given a set @xmath7 , let @xmath8=\\{w\\in v(g)\\backslash s:\\exists v\\in s:\\{v , w\\}\\in e(g)\\}$ ] be the ( closed ) neighborhood of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10\\longrightarrow v(g)$ ] be a map associating a subset of @xmath11 to each _ time _",
    ",n-1\\}$ ] .",
    "we consider the following process :    * we select a set @xmath13 and fix @xmath14 .",
    "* for each @xmath15\\backslash\\{0\\}$ ] , we have @xmath16 , where @xmath17 $ ] . moreover , if @xmath18 then there is @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21\\backslash\\{w\\}=\\mathcal{p}_{s}(t-1)$ ] .    in words , at time @xmath22 , we select a subset of vertices @xmath23 . at time @xmath24",
    ", we may insert some vertices into @xmath23 and obtain @xmath25 . the _ propagation _",
    "will go on until eventually @xmath26 , for some @xmath3 . clearly , @xmath27 .",
    "however , the propagation is not free , but it obeys some rules .",
    "specifically , a vertex @xmath1 can be inserted at time @xmath28 in @xmath29 , only if it is adjacent to @xmath19 and all other neighbors of @xmath0 ( except @xmath1 itself ) are already in @xmath30 .",
    "if there is @xmath3 such that @xmath26 , we say that @xmath9 _ propagates _ to @xmath31 .",
    "we denote this fact by @xmath32 . notice that @xmath33 .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the cardinality of a generic set @xmath35 .",
    "the figure below represents the steps of the described dynamical process taking place on a small graph .",
    "the square vertices are the elements of @xmath23 .",
    "the grey vertices are the elements of @xmath36 . in the first row of the figure ,",
    "@xmath23 is on the left and @xmath25 on the right ; in the second row , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    fig1f.eps    * interpretation .",
    "* we may depict the above scenario in a more concrete language : each vertex of an initially selected set has a packet of information ( the same for every vertex in the set ) , which has to be diffused among the vertices of the graph ; a vertex @xmath0 can pass its packet to an adjacent vertex @xmath1 only if @xmath1 is its only neighbour still without the information . in this way , @xmath0 does not need to _ discriminate _ among its neighbours , even if it is permitted to pass the information to only one of those .",
    "equivalently , this can be interpreted as a procedure for coloring ( with the same color ) the vertices of a graph , in such a way that a vertex can be colored at a certain time step , only if it is the unique uncolored neighbour of an already colored vertex .",
    "notice that the propagation is not _ synchronized _ , that is , we do not require that at a certain time @xmath3 , a vertex is necessarily included in @xmath39 if it is the unique uncolored neighbor of a colored vertex .",
    "* a quantitative question .",
    "* here is a precise mathematical problem : given a simple undirected graph @xmath31 , find a set of minimum cardinality that does propagate in @xmath31 .",
    "the cardinality of such a set will be denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "obviously @xmath40 is invariant under isomorphism , since it does not depend on the labeling of the vertices .",
    "notice that in this problem we do not take into consideration the _ propagation time_. the problem can be in fact modified by imposing time constraints . finding @xmath40 is of practical importance , when trying to optimize the number of local operations required to initialize , and then control , a networks of spin @xmath41 particles .",
    "the computational complexity aspects of the question , a formulation as an orientation problem , and approximation algorithms are studied in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , it looks like that @xmath40 depends on the expansion properties of @xmath31 .",
    "intuitively higher is the number of ways out  from each subset of vertices of a certain size and higher is @xmath40 .",
    "* structure of the paper .",
    "* we will focus mainly on trees .",
    "apart from the introduction , the paper contains two sections . in section 2 , we underline some general properties of propagation , by taking as example paths , combs and stars .",
    "we focus on homeomorphism and the maximum possible number of edges that a graph can have , given the cardinality of the initial set @xmath23 .",
    "we finally make a comment about hamiltonicity and propagation in digraphs . in section 3",
    ", we will focus on balanced trees .",
    "the main technical tool is a simple proof that the minimum cardinality of @xmath23 , such that @xmath9 propagates in a balanced binary tree , realizes the jacobsthal sequence .",
    "our reference on the theory of graphs is the book by diestel @xcite .",
    "* homeomorphism . *",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that @xmath40 is invariant under homeomorphism .",
    "it is then more appropriate to think about @xmath40 not as a quantity associated to a single graph @xmath31 , but rather to a family of graphs , whose members are all the graphs homeomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "recall that graphs @xmath31 and @xmath42 are _ homeomorphic _ if @xmath42 ( @xmath31 ) can be obtained by subdivision and smoothing on @xmath31 ( @xmath42 ) : a _ subdivision _ of an edge @xmath43 consists of deleting @xmath43 , adding a vertex @xmath1 , plus the edges @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; a _ smoothing _ is the reverse operation , and it is then performed only on vertices of degree two .",
    "a _ tree _ is a graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path .",
    "this property , plus the homeomorphism remark , make propagation on trees particularly amenable to quick observations .",
    "* let @xmath46 be the path of length @xmath47 .",
    "the path @xmath46 models the classic spin chain with equal nearest neighbor couplings , or more complex networks via the notion of graph covering and equitable partitions ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this is probably the graph for which is simplest to determine @xmath40 .",
    "indeed @xmath48 , for every @xmath47 .",
    "this fact is self - evident and it does not need a proof . if @xmath49 and @xmath50 only if @xmath51 , then it is sufficient to take @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a graph in which @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 satisfies a property @xmath58 for all @xmath59 be a family of graphs .",
    "we can look at the number @xmath60 as a function @xmath61 , defined as @xmath62 , for all @xmath63 .",
    "we have seen that @xmath64 independently of @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests the following structural graph theory problem : characterize classes of graphs @xmath65 , for which @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a constant , for all @xmath63 .",
    "paths have this behaviour , since @xmath48 , for all @xmath47 .",
    "the same can be said for @xmath47-cycles , since @xmath68 . for complete graphs",
    "this is a linear function : @xmath69 .",
    "the next figure illustrates how @xmath70 ( in the obvious way ) :    fig2f.eps    * adding edges ( i ) . * since @xmath48 and the minimum degree of @xmath46 is @xmath71 , it is also natural to ask about graphs for which @xmath40 is exactly the minimum degree , that is , the trivial lower bound .",
    "paths suggest also another question : given a graph @xmath31 on @xmath47 vertices and @xmath7 , what is the maximum number of edge that @xmath31 can have such that @xmath32 .",
    "one can obtain a cycle @xmath72 from a path @xmath46 by adding an extra edge to @xmath46 . for covering @xmath72 by propagation , we need @xmath73 . specifically , if @xmath9 contains just two adjacent vertices then @xmath74 .",
    "can we augment @xmath72 by extra edges and keep @xmath75 ?",
    "let @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 .",
    "still @xmath78 .",
    "more generally , @xmath79 .",
    "it is plausible to conjecture that when @xmath75 and @xmath80 , then @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the maximum possible number of edges that @xmath31 can have if @xmath32 .",
    "the graph @xmath83 attains the bound .",
    "the graph @xmath84 is drawn below .    fig3f.eps    * combs . * a _ comb _ @xmath85 is a path @xmath46 having a copy of @xmath86 attached to each vertex .",
    "usually the plane embedding of this tree is such that the copies of @xmath86 are all drawn in the upper region of the plane determined by @xmath46 .",
    "this justifies the term comb ; the path @xmath46 is then called _ bone _ and the paths @xmath86 are called _",
    "fingers_. so , @xmath87 .",
    "the comb @xmath85 has @xmath88 vertices of degree @xmath88 , @xmath89 vertices of degree @xmath90 , and @xmath91 vertices and @xmath3 vertices of degree @xmath71 .",
    "given the invariance under homeomorphism , it is sufficient to deal with @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , longer fingers attached to the vertices of the bone @xmath46 would not modify @xmath93 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath94 for every @xmath3",
    ". we have @xmath95 if @xmath47 is even and @xmath96 if @xmath47 is odd .",
    "the figure shows how a @xmath90-element set propagates in @xmath97 .",
    "fig4f.eps    * adding edges ( ii ) . *",
    "as we have already seen in the previous paragraphs , in some situations one can add edges , and a pre - selected set will still propagate in the graph .",
    "certainly , one can always add edges connecting only the pre - selected vertices and create a clique of size @xmath98 .",
    "in combs , differently from the case of @xmath72 , we can construct a clique of size @xmath99 , containing then @xmath100 edges .",
    "this implies that the total number of edges is going to increase with a faster peace than in @xmath72 augmented by _",
    "redundant _ edges . in a generic graph , we can always add redundant edges connecting vertices in @xmath9 and then complete the subgraph induced by @xmath9 to a clique , without altering the dynamics .",
    "other edges can be added provided that these satisfy some conditions .",
    "given @xmath101 , if we can add @xmath50 then :    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath102 .",
    "then there is a vertex @xmath103 such that @xmath104 at time @xmath105 .",
    "2 .   suppose @xmath106 .",
    "if @xmath21\\subseteq\\mathcal{p}_{s}(t)$ ] then we can simply proceed to include @xmath1 in @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath21\\nsubseteq\\mathcal{p}_{s}(t)$ ] then there is a vertex @xmath103 such that @xmath104 at time @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the time step at which @xmath110 , for some vertex @xmath111 .",
    "we ask : what is the maximum number of edges in @xmath112 so that @xmath113 ?",
    "what about graphs in general ?",
    "the answer is not immediate and we leave it as an open problem .",
    "fig5f.eps    the figure shows propagation on the comb @xmath114 , _ saturated _ with an additional number of edges .",
    "the extra edges are represented by dotted lines .",
    "note that adding a single vertex to a graph , in which we have already fixed the initially selected vertices , may be sufficient to stop the propagation .",
    "* stars . * the complete bipartite graph @xmath115 is also said to be a _ star _ on @xmath47 vertices .",
    "contextually to quantum networks , properties of free bosons hopping on star networks where investigated in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath116 then @xmath117 , by taking @xmath89 leaves ( _ i.e. _ , the vertices of degree 1 ) . among all graphs on @xmath47 vertices ,",
    "the complete graph @xmath118 is the only graph for which the ratio @xmath119 is smaller .",
    "if we include the root in @xmath9 ( _ i.e. _ , the vertex of degree @xmath120 ) , then @xmath121 .",
    "this implies that we can add @xmath122 redundant edges to @xmath115 and obtain @xmath118 such that @xmath116 and @xmath123 , for exactly the same set @xmath9 .",
    "if a graph @xmath31 has @xmath115 as a spanning subgraph then @xmath124 , for @xmath31 . recall that a _ spanning subgraph _ is a subgraph that contains all the vertices of the original graph .",
    "valuable remarking that if a set propagates in a graph then it will propagates in all of its spanning subgraphs .",
    "equally , the minimum cardinality of such a set is nonincreasing when restricting ourselves to spanning subgraphs .",
    "* digraphs and hamiltonicity . * an _ orientation _ of a graph @xmath31 is a directed graph @xmath125 obtained by giving a direction to the edges of @xmath31 and in this way substituting @xmath126 with a set of directed _ arcs_. the propagation dynamics induces a partial ordering on the vertices of @xmath31 and therefore an orientation .",
    "observe that the definition given in the introduction of this paper can be extended to digraphs in a straightforward way .",
    "we ask : given a graph @xmath31 , can we always find an orientation @xmath125 and a set @xmath9 such that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "if @xmath31 has a hamilton path then the answer is in the affirmative , because we can just orient _ forward _ the edges of the hamilton path and _ backwards _ the remaining edges .",
    "notice that the grid considered in @xcite is hamiltonian .",
    "we can then always take a single vertex to propagate in an arbitrary large grid , as far as we give a proper orientation to the edges .",
