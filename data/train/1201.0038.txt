    "this problem has important connections to the structure of viral capsids , which are closed - shell assemblies of proteins  @xcite , and more recently has been the subject of experimental interest in the context of particle - stabilized emulsion droplets  @xcite . a clear physical picture of the coupling between surface curvature and the presence of topological defects has emerged based on the continuum elasticity theory of crystalline membranes  @xcite . in this theory , disclinations carrying a discrete topological charge act as point sources for in - plane stress that can be screened by a more homogeneous distribution of  topological charge \" generated by the appropriate gaussian curvature of the membrane . from this viewpoint , the net topological charge of disclinations in the lowest energy states of curved membranes",
    "is rationally expected to increase with the integrated gaussian curvature of a membrane , a prediction which has recently been tested experimentally for 2d crystals on surfaces of both positive and negative curvature  @xcite .",

    ", we find the mean - spacing between dislocations , @xmath163 integrating the linear density of dislocations along the length of grain boundaries ( @xmath164 ) we find the mean number of dislocations per arm , @xmath165 multiplying @xmath148 by the number of grain boundaries in the cross section , we argue that for large twist , @xmath166 . to capture both limiting cases of large twist and the critical twist at which @xmath17 vanishes , we construct the following scaling form for total disclination number , @xmath167 .\\ ] ] hence , not only do larger bundles become unstable to dislocations at smaller values of bundle twist , the growth of the optimal number of dislocations with  excess \" twist in large bundles is also more rapid than in smaller bundles .    in fig . [",
    "fig : scaling ] we compare the total dislocation number of the numerically - determined ground states to the scaling prediction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "we find that the scaling prediction agrees well with numerical results over the range of @xmath17 and the large range of bundle sizes explored here , @xmath168 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that geometric frustration arising from helical twist in two - dimensionally ordered filament bundles restructures the ground - state packing at intermediate twist by favoring the presence of appropriately oriented , edge dislocations .",
    "based on the continuum theory of disclinations and dislocations in filament bundles , we show that _ dislocations _ become favorable in the cross section at twist smaller than the critical twist needed to stabilize _",
    "5-fold disclinations_. unlike the case of stable 5-fold disclinations studied previously  @xcite , here we find that the threshold for stable dislocations in bundles is highly dependent on the size of the bundle compared to the microscopic inter - filament spacing . above the threshold single dislocations in twisted bundles ,",
    "we predict a rich spectrum of low - symmetry ground - state order .",
    "twist - induced stresses in filament bundles lead to a natural tendency to  polygonalize \" the cross - sectional packing , giving rise to low - energy structures where multiple crystalline domains are separated by radially - extending grain boundaries that terminate in the bundle bulk , not unlike the finite - length grain - boundary scars of spherical crystals .",
    "this study is significant in the context of frustrated order because it demonstrates that  neutral \" configurations of topological defects may effectively screen  charged \" , geometrically - induced stresses , like the stresses generated by filament twist in bundles .",
    "previous studies of defects on curved , crystalline membranes , have predicted extended chains dislocations , or scars , only in the presence of excess disclinations that are themselves either forced in by topology  @xcite or , in the case of a membranes with a free boundary , as the result of energetic coupling to curvature - induced stresses  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the dislocation arrays function to screen the disclination stress more efficiently than the stresses induced by gaussian curvature . here",
    ", we show that neutral arrays of 5 - 7 disclination pairs flood the ground - state packing of crystalline bundles well before twist favors the incorporation of excess 5-fold defects .",
    "that is , dislocations arrays are also driven into the packing of frustrated materials by the tendency to screen geometrically - induced stresses alone .",
    "due to the formal relationship between the non - linear elasticity of twisted bundles and curved , crystalline membranes , we expect that the novel grain - boundary geometries predicted here may also occur as ground states of the latter system .    in the context of filamentous materials ,",
    "the present study is significant for two reasons .",
    "first , it identifies @xmath49 and @xmath12 as the two geometric parameters that govern the ground state packing of helically - twisted bundles .",
    "importantly , we show that the critical degree of twist at which the bundle cross section becomes unstable to topological defects is crucially sensitive to bundle size , @xmath12 .",
    "we may relate the reduced twist of the bundle to the tilt angle , @xmath169 of the outermost filament with respect the pitch axis of the helical bundle by , @xmath170 . for small bundles , less than a few radial filament layers , the critical twist for stability of _",
    "any _ defect type in the cross section corresponds to a degree of tilt greater than @xmath171 .",
    "because the critical twist decreases with bundle size as @xmath172 , for bundles that are macroscopically large compared to filament size , say @xmath149 , the critical degree of filament tilt is markedly reduced to nearly @xmath173 . for comparison",
    ", we note the helical twist of certain collagen fibrils is in the range @xmath174 of helical tilt  @xcite .    the case of collagen points to the second important result regarding the structure of optimally - packed twisted fibers . in many tissue types , collagen fibrils form with lateral dimensions hundreds of times larger than the roughly 1 nm scale of constituent filaments , making multiple dislocations",
    "energetically favorable even in fibrils of relatively modest twist .",
    "notably the precise nature of the cross - sectional ordering of collagen molecules in fibrils is a long - standing and open question , in part , due to small - angle scattering data that suggest cross sections are composed of unknown superpositions of crystalline inter - molecular order and disordered inter - molecular packing of some type .",
    "numerous models have been proposed to infer the real - space packing  @xcite , many of which mix aspects of crystalline and non - crystalline order in novel ways  @xcite . to date , the model most consistent with observed features of x - ray scattering data was proposed by hulmes , wess , prockop and fratzl  @xcite . in this model , multiple crystalline domains in a cylindrical bundles are separated by grain boundaries extending radially from a central , low - density region to the surface of the fibril .",
    "remarkably , this model is very similar in gross structure to the ground states of twisted bundles predicted for large bundles of intermediate twist ( for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : r100 ] ) .",
    "though this model of collagen fibril packing did not take into account the effects of twist explicitly , we believe many of the key features of the  disordered \" packing of these materials may be understood as crucial elements of energy - minimizing packings of twisted bundles .",
    "future work will explore the form factor of ideal packings of twisted bundles and critically test the intriguing and putative connection between defects in the ground states of twisted bundles and the disorder in the collagen fibril .",
