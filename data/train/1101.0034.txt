    "top quark pair production in @xmath2 collisions is a sensitive probe of quantum chromodynamics at high energy . at lowest order in the standard model ( sm ) , quark pair production is symmetric under charge conjugation . at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "the interference of processes that differ under charge conjugation leads to a small forward - backward asymmetry of order @xmath11 in the @xmath0 rest frame  @xcite .",
    "an analogous effect is predicted at order @xmath12 in qed and is confirmed in measurements of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "study of the nlo qcd asymmetry in inclusive jet events is hampered by the difficulty of measuring the jet charge . in pair produced top quarks with one semi - leptonic decay , the top can be tagged according to the well - measured lepton charge , enabling a probe of the nlo qcd effect and a test of charge conjugation symmetry in strong interactions at high energy .",
    "the cdf and d0 experiments have made initial measurements of the @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 tev at the fermilab tevatron @xcite . in the @xmath14-invariant @xmath2 system",
    ", the nlo qcd effect appears as a charge dependent forward - backward asymmetry of the top quark direction with respect to the proton direction . using data samples corresponding to @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , cdf and d0 report positive asymmetries that are consistent with the qcd prediction within large experimental uncertainties .",
    "a number of theoretical papers suggest interesting new physics mechanisms including axigluons , diquarks , new weak bosons , and extra - dimensions that can all produce forward - backward @xmath0 asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the model building must accommodate the observed consistency of the @xmath0 cross - section and total invariant mass distribution with the sm qcd prediction @xcite .",
    "we report here on a new study of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 tev , using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath17 recorded with the cdf ii detector .",
    "we study events with the lepton+jets topology , where either the @xmath4 or @xmath5 has decayed semileptonically .",
    "the asymmetries are measured in two variables : @xmath18 , the rapidity of the hadronically decaying top quark , corresponding to the top rapidity in the laboratory ( lab ) frame , and @xmath6 , the difference of the rapidities of the leptonic and hadronic top systems , which measures the top quark rapidity in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "we show that @xmath4 and @xmath5 asymmetries are consistent with @xmath14 conservation , and combine them to measure the total asymmetry in the sample .",
    "we measure the inclusive asymmetries , and the functional dependence of the @xmath0 frame asymmetry on @xmath6 and on the total invariant mass of the @xmath0 system , @xmath7 .",
    "we apply corrections for backgrounds , acceptance , and resolution to calculate parton level measures of the inclusive asymmetry in both the lab and @xmath0 rest frames , and in two regions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the @xmath0 frame .",
    "cdf ii is a general purpose , azimuthally and forward - backward symmetric magnetic spectrometer with calorimetry and muon detectors @xcite .",
    "charged particle trajectories are measured with a silicon - microstrip detector backed by a large open - cell drift chamber in a 1.4 t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters located outside the solenoid provide jet and missing energy reconstruction . outside the calorimeter are multilayer proportional chambers and plastic scintillator hodoscopes that provide muon identification in the pseudorapidity region @xmath19 .",
    "we use a cylindrical coordinate system with origin at the detector center and z - axis along the proton direction @xcite .",
    "this measurement uses @xmath20 candidate events in the `` lepton+jets '' topology , where one top quark decays semileptonically ( @xmath21 ) and the other hadronically ( @xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "we detect the lepton and four jets from top quark decays and quark hadronization , and an inferred neutrino based on the presence of missing energy .",
    "the detector is triggered by a high transverse momentum electron(muon ) in the central portion of the detector with @xmath23 gev(gev / c ) and @xmath24 .",
    "we require four or more hadronic jets with @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 , and a large amount of missing transverse energy , @xmath27 gev , consistent with the presence of an undetected neutrino .",
    "the jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm with @xmath28 , and calorimeter signals are corrected for detector inefficiencies and for the energy scale factor .",
    "the secvtx algorithm @xcite is used to find displaced @xmath29-decay vertices using the tracks within the jet cones , and at least one jet must contain such a `` @xmath29-tag '' .",
    "jets with @xmath29-tags are restricted to @xmath24 .",
    "a total of 1260 events pass this selection .",
    "the size of the non-@xmath0 background processes in the lepton+jets+@xmath29-tag selection is derived in precision measurements of the @xmath0 production cross - section @xcite . the estimated background in our sample @xmath30 events .",
    "the predominant backgrounds are from qcd - induced w+multi - parton events containing either @xmath29-tagged heavy - flavor jets or errantly tagged light - flavor jets .",
    "these are modeled using a simulation sample derived from the alpgen generator @xcite and a data driven technique that derives tagging efficiencies , mis - tagging rates and sample normalizations from direct measurement . a background component from qcd multi - jet events with fake leptons and mis - measured @xmath31",
    "is modeled using multi - jet events with lepton candidates that are rejected by our cuts .",
    "other small backgrounds from electroweak processes ( @xmath32 , single - top ) are reliably estimated using monte carlo generators .",
    "further details on the sample selection and background modeling can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reconstruction ( reco ) of the @xmath0 kinematics uses the measured momenta of the lepton , the @xmath31 , and the four leading jets in the event .",
    "the jet - parton assignment and calculation of the @xmath0 four - vectors uses a simple @xmath33-based fit of the lepton and jet kinematics to the @xmath0 hypothesis , allowing the jet energies to float within their expected uncertainties , and applying the constraints that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath29-tagged jets are associated with b - partons .",
    "this algorithm is well understood in the context of precision top mass measurements , where the fit is performed without the top mass constraint  @xcite , and other top physics studies that use the top mass constraint  @xcite .",
    "we study the reconstructed top quark rapidity and the difference in the reconstructed top and anti - top rapidities , from which we derive the forward - backward asymmetries in the @xmath2 ( laboratory ) rest frame and in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "the validity of the analysis is checked at all steps by comparison to a standard prediction made using the pythia  @xcite @xmath0 model , the cdf lepton+jets+@xmath29-tag background model , and a full simulation of the cdf - ii detector .",
    "we use pythia 6.2.16 with cteq5l parton distribution functions  @xcite and @xmath36 .",
    "the background model developed in concert with the precision cross - section studies provides good measures of both the normalizations and shapes of the non-@xmath0 processes @xcite .",
    "the veracity of the combined pythia plus background model , and in particular , its reliability for the estimation of systematic uncertainties , is well verified in many other top - physics studies at cdf  @xcite .    note",
    "that because pythia does not include the nlo qcd charge asymmetry , the standard pythia prediction is not the sm prediction for the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "studies with the mc@nlo generator @xcite ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : mcnlo ] ) predict that the magnitude of reconstructed qcd asymmetry in our sample is smaller than the current experimental resolution .",
    "symmetric pythia is thus a good approximation for sm @xmath0 and provides an unbiased control sample for many of our studies .",
    "we will compare our measurements to the sm predictions of mc@nlo when appropriate .",
    "in the lepton+jets decay topology of the @xmath0 pair , there is a leptonic decay , @xmath37 , and a hadronic decay @xmath38 . the complications of the central lepton acceptance and the reconstruction of the neutrino from the @xmath31 create a difference in the reconstruction resolution for the two different kinds of decay . in order to control effects of this kind",
    ", our treatment of top rapidity variables maintains the distinction between the leptonic and hadronic decay systems , with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 assignments following in accordance with the lepton charge .",
    "the most direct measurement of the top direction with respect to the beamline is the rapidity of the hadronic top system in the lab frame , @xmath18 , which has acceptance out to @xmath39 and good directional precision . in events with a negative ( positive ) lepton",
    ", @xmath18 is the lab rapidity of the @xmath4 quark , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 quark , @xmath42 ) .",
    "if @xmath14 is a good symmetry , the distributions of @xmath42 and @xmath40 are reflections of each other , and we can combine both samples , weighting with the lepton charge , to use @xmath43 as the rapidity of the @xmath4 quark in the lab frame , @xmath40 .",
    "a frame independent measurement is available in the rapidity difference of the leptonic and hadronic systems @xmath44 .",
    "after multiplication by the lepton charge @xmath45 , this variable measures the difference between the top and antitop rapidities : @xmath46 . the rapidity difference",
    "@xmath6 is independent of the @xmath0 system longitudinal motion and is simply related to the top quark rapidity in the @xmath0 rest frame : @xmath47 . since the rapidity preserves the sign of the production angle , an asymmetry in @xmath6 is identical to the asymmetry in the top quark production angle in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath50 are identified with either a @xmath4 or an @xmath5 by the sign of the lepton in the event , they are the primary variables for defining the charge dependence of the asymmetries and testing for @xmath14 invariance .",
    "we define the forward - backward charge asymmetry in the @xmath0 rest frame to be :                since these models have relatively low - lying octet masses near 2 tev/@xmath54 we expect a significant @xmath7-dependent asymmetry over our experimental range . the @xmath55 behavior for the two color - octet samples is shown in fig .  [ fig : dadm_axig ] .",
    "both show a smooth and significant rise of the asymmetry with increasing mass .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : hilowmass ] we discussed a simple representation of @xmath56 with two regions of low and high @xmath7 .",
    "the question for that representation is how to choose the boundary mass between high and low .",
    "table  [ tab : avm_high_axi ] shows the asymmetry , uncertainty , and significance @xmath57 at high mass as a function of the mass threshold for both octet models .",
    "the uncertainties are calculated assuming the data sample size of @xmath17 . for both samples , the significance of the asymmetry at high mass is maximum at reconstructed @xmath58 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : mttb ] , we see that this is reasonable : @xmath59 cuts off the bulk of the low mass peak while retaining good statistics on the tail .",
    "[ fig : avm2bins_octet ] compares the @xmath6 distributions in the octeta sample and pythia when the events are divided into samples below and above @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution is much broader at high mass , as expected , and shows a marked asymmetry .",
    "the reconstructed asymmetries at high and low mass in the color octet samples are given in table  [ tab : ahilowcharges_axig ] .",
    "the uncertainties here reflect the monte carlo statistics . at high mass",
    "the color octet samples have large asymmetries as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : avm2bins_octet ] . at low mass ,",
    "the models have small but significant asymmetries , especially in octetb .",
    "we have checked that these asymmetries are charge asymmetries , reversing sign under interchange of lepton charge .",
