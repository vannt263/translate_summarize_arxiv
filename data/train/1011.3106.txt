    "the high - density phase with an infinite aggregate disappears , although its imprint in the form of a large aggregate is observed in finite systems .",
    "further , the steady - state probability distribution @xmath1 decays exponentially with @xmath7 for all @xmath9 and @xmath46 .    before concluding this discussion , a few words regarding the condensation transition are in order .",
    "the condensation observed in the model in eqs .",
    "( [ snm1])-([snm0 ] ) occurs due to the dynamical rules of evolution and not due to an `` attraction '' between the masses .",
    "though it shares analogies with _ bose - einstein condensation _ ( bec ) , an important difference is that these condensates are formed in real space rather than momentum space as is the case in bec . as a matter of fact",
    ", condensation occurs in a variety of seemingly diverse systems which are governed by nonequilibrium dynamics @xcite .",
    "we now discuss some physical applications of mass - transport models .",
    "the aim here is to stress the general nature of the questions addressed in a variety of physical situations involving mass transport .",
    "recently , there has been much research interest in suspensions of single - domain _ magnetic nanoparticles _ ( mnp ) , which have a wide range of technological applications , e.g. , memory devices , magnetic resonance imaging , targeted drug delivery , bio - markers and bio - sensors @xcite . a major reason for the utility of mnps",
    "is the ease with which they can be detected and manipulated by an external magnetic field .",
    "their response times are strongly size - dependent , thus introducing the possibility of controlling particle sizes to obtain desired response times .",
    "an inherent property of mnp suspensions is cluster formation , due to the presence of attractive interactions of varying strengths between the constituent particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , mass - transport models with fragmentation and aggregation have been traditionally employed to study clustering dynamics in these systems .",
    "the steady - state cluster - size distributions and the average cluster size are determined by the interplay between aggregation ( due to attractive interactions ) and fragmentation ( due to repulsive interactions and thermal noise ) @xcite .",
    "assuming that the number of particles is @xmath47 , and denoting the number of clusters containing @xmath0 particles at time @xmath8 by @xmath48 , the rate equations in the mf approximation are as follows @xcite : @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ reqn ] ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the aggregation and fragmentation kernels , respectively .",
    "the aggregation kernel describes the coalescence of two clusters containing @xmath11 and @xmath52 particles to yield a larger cluster with @xmath0 @xmath4 @xmath53 particles . in many models",
    ", it is assumed to have a mass - dependent form , @xmath50 @xmath4 @xmath54 .",
    "this accounts for the reduced mobility of large clusters .",
    "the fragmentation kernel @xmath51 describes the loss of one particle from a cluster with @xmath0 particles , and has also been assumed to have a mass - dependent form , @xmath55 .",
    "equation  ( [ reqn ] ) can be rewritten in terms of probability distributions [ cf .",
    "( [ rate1])-([rate10 ] ) ] by introducing a normalization factor , @xmath56 .",
    "our second example is in the context of traffic models . in this context",
    ", we discuss the so - called _ bus route model _",
    "( brm ) @xcite . here",
    ", one is interested in the initial conditions or parameters which result in a clustering of buses or a traffic jam .",
    "the model is defined on a 1-dimensional lattice of size @xmath57 .",
    "each site @xmath11 has two associated variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 : ( i ) if a site @xmath11 is occupied by a bus , @xmath58 @xmath4 1 ; otherwise @xmath58 @xmath4 0 .",
    "( ii ) if a site @xmath11 has passengers , then @xmath59 @xmath4 1 ; otherwise @xmath59 @xmath4 0 .",
    "a site can not have both @xmath58 @xmath4 @xmath59 @xmath4 1 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "if there are @xmath61 buses , the bus density @xmath9 @xmath4 @xmath62 is a conserved quantity .",
    "however , the total number of sites with passengers is not conserved .",
    "the update rules are as follows : ( i ) pick a site @xmath11 at random .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath58 @xmath4 @xmath63 0 , then set @xmath59 @xmath4 1 with rate @xmath64 , i.e. , a passenger arrives at an empty site with rate @xmath64 .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath58 @xmath4 1 and @xmath65 @xmath4 0 , a bus hops onto a site with no passengers ( @xmath66 0 ) with rate @xmath42 , and to a site with passengers ( @xmath67 @xmath4 1 ) with rate @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the variables @xmath69 0 and @xmath70 1 and @xmath71 0 with rate @xmath42 or @xmath68 , as the case may be . usually , @xmath72 as the buses slow down when passengers are being picked up .",
    "a jam in the system is a gap between buses of size @xmath73 , which is stable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the mf approximation of this model considers the distribution of gaps @xmath74 , ignoring the time - correlations in the hopping of buses .",
    "it should be noted here that , unlike the mass - transport models described in sec .",
    "[ s2a ] , the brm is asymmetric .",
    "thus , the movement of the buses is unidirectional although the hop rate is proportional to the size of the gap .",
    "these features put the brm in a class of models which are referred to as _ zero - range processes _ ( zrp ) @xcite .",
    "the important property of a zrp is that it yields a steady - state as a product of marginals calculated using well - defined procedures @xcite .",
    "further , mf calculations are exact for this class of models .    from simulations of the discrete model , heuristic arguments and mf",
    "theory , oloan et al .",
    "obtain evidence of a jamming transition as a function of the density of buses @xmath9 . in terms of buses and passengers ,",
    "the jam may be interpreted as follows .",
    "an ideal situation is one where the buses are evenly distributed along the route so that each bus picks up approximately the same number of passengers .",
    "jamming or clustering of buses may occur if one of the buses gets delayed due to some fluctuation at a pick - up point .",
    "subsequently , the buses which follow catch up with the delayed bus resulting in a jam !",
    "an important observation here is that the jamming is a consequence of a local , stochastic dynamics which couples the conserved variable ( buses ) and the nonconserved variable ( passengers ) .",
    "the transition is reminiscent of the condensation transition described earlier @xcite , and has also been useful in describing _ clogging _ in the transport of sticky particles down a pipe @xcite .      as a final example , we consider the packing of granular materials , which is important in many technological processes .",
    "the crucial issue in these problems is understanding the complex network of forces which is responsible for the static structure and properties of granular materials .",
    "one such system which has been subjected to experiments , simulations and analysis is a pack of spherical beads in a compression cell @xcite .",
    "the bead pack is modeled as a regular lattice of sites , each having a particle of unit mass .",
    "the mechanisms which lead to the formation of force chains in the system are summarized in the rules defined below : ( i ) each site @xmath11 in layer @xmath75 is connected to @xmath47 sites @xmath52 in layer @xmath76 .",
    "( ii ) only vertical forces are considered explicitly .",
    "a fraction @xmath77 of the total weight supported by particle @xmath11 in layer @xmath75 is transmitted to particle @xmath52 in layer @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the weight @xmath78 supported by the particle at the @xmath79 site in layer @xmath75 satisfies the stochastic equation @xmath80 the @xmath81 are independently - distributed random variables which satisfy the constraint @xmath82 @xmath4 1 , required for enforcing the force - balance condition on each particle .    in general",
    ", the values of @xmath83 at neighboring sites in layer @xmath75 are not independent .",
    "the mf approximation of this model ignores these correlations . defining a normalized weight variable @xmath84",
    ", we want to obtain the force distribution @xmath85 , i.e. , the probability that a site at depth @xmath75 is subject to a vertical force @xmath86 . within the mf approximation , it is possible to obtain a recursive equation for @xmath85 .",
    "coppersmith et al .",
    "@xcite found that , for almost all distributions of @xmath26 , the distribution of forces decays exponentially .",
    "however , a power - law decay was also observed in some cases .",
    "let us first consider the 1-chip model .",
    "the chipping kernel has the simple form @xmath87 with the above kernel , eqs .",

    "we use the corresponding mean - field ( mf ) equations to obtain the steady - state probability distributions [ @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 for different functional forms of @xmath133 .",
    "we show that a large class of chipping kernels , where @xmath133 is independent of @xmath7 , give rise to an exponentially - decaying distribution : @xmath209 .",

    "( [ soln11 ] ) ] , where one unit of mass fragments from a site and aggregates with a randomly - chosen nearest - neighbor .",
    "we have also discussed @xmath0-chip models for fragmentation and aggregation .",
    "the resulting steady - state distribution has @xmath0 branches , each of which decays exponentially with the same slope .",
    "this slope is determined by the average density @xmath9 , and the population of the branches in the initial condition @xmath138 for the rate equations ( [ rate1])-([rate10 ] ) .",
    "the initial population in each of the branches is conserved during the evolution , and is also reflected in the steady - state distribution .    finally , we compared the mf analytical results with those from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in @xmath210 . in all cases",
    ", we found that the mf results for @xmath1 vs. @xmath7 were in excellent agreement with the mc results .",
