    "the investigation of the quantum mechanical behaviour of systems with classically chaotic counterparts is a rich and exciting field of study .",
    "many beautiful results have been found over the years regarding the semiclassical quantization of nonintegrable systems @xcite and `` quantum chaology '' @xcite . a major component of the approach involves the study of eigenvalue statistics , eigenfunction `` scarring '' etc .",
    "classical chaotic behaviour , however , by definition a dynamical phenomenon , seems to be suppressed at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "apart from a brief time , during which its behaviour effectively mimics the classically chaotic dynamics , the quantized version of a bounded and conservative classical system is quasiperiodic and , therefore , predictable @xcite .",
    "chaotic systems thus test our understanding of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "if classical behaviour is not a naturally emergent property of such systems in the absence of explicit measurements then it is natural to consider the effect of environments on the quantum system @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanical interference and superpositions , the cause of the aforementioned discrepancy , can be shown to be destroyed on extremely short timescales , in tractable model systems , by opening these systems to environmental influences @xcite . some features of classical behaviour",
    "can then emerge without having to take the semi - classical limit .",
    "zurek and paz @xcite have used the exactly solvable , inverted harmonic oscillator to model heuristically unstable chaotic motion near a hyperbolic point , although this system is certainly not chaotic itself .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is @xmath0 the effect of the the environment on this system might be expected to provide clues to the behaviour that might be observed if we were to open a chaotic system in a similar manner .",
    "the oscillator can be described by a master equation in the position basis .",
    "choosing the bath as a collection of harmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium at high temperature , with an ohmic spectral density proportional to a _ small _ dissipation parameter , simplifies this equation enormously .",
    "analysing the time evolution of an initial minimum uncertainty state using this equation , zurek and paz have found that the von neumann entropy , @xmath1 , quickly begins to increase linearly in time with a rate set by the quantity , @xmath2 in equation ( [ iho ] ) , @xmath3    recently , however , we have generalized this result @xcite by considering the entropy production for all temperatures and for non - negligible dissipation parameters , @xmath4 .",
    "we found that equation ( [ zpc ] ) is modified to @xmath5 but reduces to it when @xmath6 , as required .",
    "as @xmath2 is loosely analagous to the lyapunov exponent of a chaotic system , zurek and paz conjecture that the entropy production rate might differentiate between chaotic and regular systems , and that this rate will also be determined by the ( positive ) lyapunov exponent of the classical system . from the alekseev - brudno theorem ( see p.4 in @xcite , also @xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the shannon entropy , @xmath9 is the kolmogorov - sinai entropy - a measure of the average rate at which a classical system will lose information @xcite - and the sum is over all the local positive lyapunov exponents , @xmath10 , in phase space . from this definition , of course",
    ", it is clear that @xmath9 is actually an entropy _",
    "rate_. consequently we will modify the zurek and paz conjecture to the statement that @xmath11 increases _ linearly _ with @xmath9 .",
    "this has the attractive feature of dealing both in the classical and quantum mechanical cases with the change of entropy in time .",
    "furthermore , the equality in equation ( [ zpc ] ) has been replaced with the weaker statement of linear increase .",
    "this is the conjecture that we will consider throughout the rest of our discussion .",
    "the idea that quantum systems can be defined as `` chaotic '' or `` regular '' , depending on their behaviour under a perturbed evolution , is appealing and an old one @xcite .",
    "an approach similar in spirit is due to schack and caves @xcite , who have recently considered perturbed quantum maps in an information theoretic framework and have established a criterion for chaos known as `` hypersensitivity to perturbation '' . in this paper",
    "we will study the prototypical , theoretically important @xcite and experimentally realizable @xcite quantum kicked rotor .",
    "however , we will consider the dynamics under the influence of a tractable , model environment and seek to find evidence for the modified conjecture when the parameters of the combined system are compatible with those assumed during the framing of the conjecture .",
    "the plan for the paper is as follows . in section [ section2 ] we shall briefly outline the features of the classical and quantum kicked rotor relevant to the present study . in section [ section3 ] we will derive the one - step propagators for both the ( reduced ) density matrix of the rotor and its associated wigner function representation .",
    "the latter result allows us to see clearly that by opening the system we still have a quantum analogue of the classical kicked rotor , or rather its standard map .",
    "also in this section we endeavour to quantify the effect of the environment on the coherence of the system .",
    "the results from our numerical analysis follow in section [ section4 ] wherein we will produce firm evidence in favour of the use of entropy production as a criterion for quantum chaos _ and _ of the modified conjecture , at least in the parameter ranges considered .",
    "we will also suggest explanations for those features found not to be in accordance with the conjecture .",
    "the conclusions follow in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the kicked rotor model has been used extensively in studies of classical chaos and its quantum manifestations @xcite .",
    "consequently the literature is vast , but for convenience we outline here those features of its complex behaviour necessary for an understanding of our model and results . even for readers familiar with the model",
    "a perusal would be useful in order to establish the notation used .",
    "the system hamiltonian with which we will deal is that of a periodically kicked rotor , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an angular momentum and @xmath14 is a scaled angle variable .",
    "integrating the equations of motion from immediately after a delta function `` kick '' to just after the next such kick will give a version of the famous _ standard map _",
    "@xmath15 the map is periodic , with period 1 , in both directions of phase space - in the angle direction by definition and in the momentum direction due to the form of the map .",
    "this means that one can simply view trajectories projected back onto the unit square , @xmath16 , in order to study the dynamics for different initial conditions .",
    "however , even though there is periodicity in the momentum direction , the momentum is actually defined on the infinite interval @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the phase space has , therefore , the topology of a cylinder .",
    "the nonlinearity of the map is controlled by strength of the kick , @xmath18 .",
    "the trivial , regular motion when @xmath19 , becomes more and more complicated as @xmath18 is increased @xcite .",
    "when @xmath20 some kam tori span the cylinder and prevent diffusion in the momentum direction .",
    "as @xmath18 increases still further these tori are destroyed , allowing the momentum to diffuse , i.e. @xmath21 at a rate determined by the diffusion constant , @xmath22 . here",
    ", the averaging is over a distribution of initial conditions .",
    "the diffusion constant can be calculated analytically @xcite , and it is found that correlations in the angle variable from kick to kick influence its form considerably . if we ignore such correlations - an increasingly accurate approximation as @xmath23 - the angle variable can be assumed to be randomly but uniformly distributed on the unit interval .",
    "this _ quasilinear _ approximation allows us to write @xmath24 inclusion of these dynamical correlations leads to corrections which decrease in magnitude as @xmath18 gets larger , i.e. it is found @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a bessel function of order 2 .    for all finite values of @xmath18 ,",
    "kam tori remain around elliptic points in phase space , of which there are an infinite number .",
    "these stable islands , surrounded by a chaotic sea , characterize what is known as a  mixed \" phase space , meaning that two nearby trajectories either remain  near \" to one another for all time or diverge exponentially , depending on whether they are to be found in a regular region or a chaotic one , respectively ( see figures [ [ fig1 ] ] and [ [ fig2 ] ] ) .",
    "hence the lyapunov exponents for the system are dependent on the starting point in phase space , but gradually converge to a uniform value as @xmath23 .    from pesin",
    "s theorem @xcite , the kicked rotor , being a chaotic system with one degree - of - freedom , possesses a positive _ ks entropy _",
    ", @xmath9 , which will be equal to its positive lyapunov exponent for @xmath18 sufficiently large .",
    "chirikov @xcite has calculated this quantity and found @xmath27      the periodicity of the angle variable gives rise to a numerable and discrete set of momentum eigenvalues defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integer .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are obviously eigenstates too of the kinetic energy operator @xmath30 , and we write @xmath31    the hamiltonian of equation ( [ qkrham ] ) leads to a one - step unitary transformation @xmath32 which defines the quantum standard map . here",
    ", @xmath33 is the time after the @xmath34th kick and @xmath35 is the unitary kick evolution operator .",
    "it can be written in the momentum representation as @xmath36 with @xmath37 denoting a bessel function of integer order @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the operator corresponding to unitary free rotation between the delta function kicks , and has the momentum representation @xmath40    the unitary dynamics was first investigated by casati at al .",
    "@xcite using initial states highly localized in momentum .",
    "it was found that @xmath41 shows diffusive behaviour in approximate agreement with the classical case , but only up to a finite _ break _ time , @xmath42 , after which the momentum ceases to grow further and quasiperiodic motion around some finite average is found .",
    "this defines a _ localization length _ via @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "good analytic and numerical evidence now exists pointing to the fact that the eigenstates of the unitary evolution operator of equation ( [ ut ] ) above are localized in momentum and have essentially discrete spectra on the unit circle of the complex plane .",
    "these assumptions lead to the following estimates for @xmath45 and @xmath42 @xcite @xmath46 and @xmath47 it is important to note that both quantities are inversely proportional to the square of the scaled unit of action , @xmath48 .",
    "we also note that _ classical _ correlations , which can both increase and decrease the diffusion constant from its quasilinear value , @xmath49 , ( see equations ( [ dql ] ) and ( [ dk ] ) ) can also directly affect the quantum dynamics via this localization mechanism .",
    "the discrepancy between the classical and quantum diffusive behaviour of the kicked rotor is therefore known to be a consequence of quantum interference .",
    "if the phase coherence could somehow be destroyed one might expect to recover the classical diffusion .",
    "various authors have considered this problem @xcite and have examined the effect of an environment on localization .",
    "however , previously the relationship between the classical and quantum entropy production , the former being a quantitative measure of chaos , has _ not _ been studied .",
    "this approach is important since we have growing evidence that it is a generic one .",
    "we now proceed to derive the propagator for the density matrix of the rotor after tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom , i.e. the propagator for the _ reduced _ density matrix .",
    "this will enable us to calculate the von neumann entropy at each time step , upon iteration of an arbitrary initial state .",
    "we will restrict attention to the situation _ between _ kicks initially and consider the free rotor to be coupled through its momentum to a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators .",

    "we choose an uncorrelated initial product state @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the density matrix of the @xmath58th harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath59 , defined by @xmath60^{-1 } \\sum_{n } \\exp \\left ( \\frac{- n \\hbar \\omega_{k}}{k_{b } t } \\right ) |n \\rangle \\langle n|.\\ ] ]    to specify the problem further we also need to choose a physically reasonable environmental _ spectral density _",
    "@xcite , @xmath61 , defined formally by @xmath62 more generally , if we assume every environmental oscillator to have equal mass , we can write @xcite @xmath63 with a smooth density @xmath64 . in order to avoid the influence of unphysical , extremely high frequencies we assume the existence of an upper , or cutoff frequency , @xmath65 , and",
    "choose a continuum of oscillators distributed according to the density @xmath66 with @xmath67 , which reduces to that used by caldeira and leggett @xcite when we choose a so - called _ ohmic _ environment with @xmath68 .",
    "hamiltonians and initial conditions of this ohmic type have been considered by jiushu et al . in @xcite and the _ exact _ time evolution for the reduced density matrix has been obtained .",
    "we proceed along similar lines but consider the general case with @xmath67 being the only assumption .",
    "we arrive finally at an expression for the reduced density matrix of the rotor in the momentum representation @xmath69 the environmental terms in this expression , given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , have been evaluated explicitly for all @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the expressions are particularly simple , however , for the ohmic case , and we concentrate on this important case from here on .",
    "we find @xmath72 and @xmath73 where the usual notation of @xmath74 has also been used .",
    "there are a few points to note here .",
    "firstly , were @xmath19 in equation ( [ qkrham ] ) , then equation ( [ rdm ] ) would describe fully the time evolution of any initial state , @xmath75 , in the momentum representation , for a classically _ nonchaotic _ rotor . secondly , we return to the correct unitary dynamics , corresponding to conservative evolution of the rotor , when @xmath76 is set to @xmath77 .",
    "( this amounts to setting all coupling constants , @xmath78 , to zero . ) finally , we will consider equation ( [ rdm ] ) to describe the time evolution of the quantum kicked rotor between kicks and so will set @xmath79 in equations ( [ rdm ] ) , ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the heat bath is assumed to be sufficiently large to remain in thermal equilibrium as it interacts with the system between each kick .",
    "for this assumption to be valid the coupling constants , @xmath80 , are taken to be _",
    "small_. hence , for the spectral density in equation ( [ density ] ) , @xmath81 , a common assumption @xcite .",
    "the system evolution , from just after the kick at @xmath82 until just _ before _ the kick at @xmath83 , where @xmath34 is an integer , is given by a master equation of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 @xmath86 is the unitary summation kernel given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 describes the non - unitary influence of the environment on the dynamics .",
    "it is assumed that during each kick both free evolution and the influence of the environment are negligible .",
    "we are then led formally to the summation kernel for the kick , defined by the master equation @xmath89 choosing now the shorthand notation used by dittrich and graham @xcite of @xmath90 and @xmath91 we can write explicitly @xmath92    even as the density matrix evolves , according to master equations ( [ fprop ] ) and ( [ kprop ] ) above , it must , of course , remain normalized , hermitian and positive @xcite . these properties in turn impose conditions on the kernels of equations ( [ gf ] ) and ( [ gk ] ) which can easily be shown to hold @xcite , implying that the evolution of the reduced quantum statistical density operator is a valid one .",
    "the one time - step evolution of the density matrix is now simply the convolution of @xmath93 and @xmath94 defined in equations ( [ gf ] ) and ( [ gk ] ) above , respectively , and it is easily confirmed that @xmath95 where @xmath96 in which @xmath97 is the unperturbed , unitary propagator .",
    "when there is no environment , i.e. as @xmath98 , then @xmath99 for each @xmath29 and @xmath38 .",
    "it was stated above that the term @xmath100 in equation ( [ rhoprop ] ) makes a non - unitary contribution to the dynamics . in this section",
    "we would like to quantify this statement .",
    "a measure of decoherence is the decay probability , @xmath101 , of a quasienergy eigenstate in a single timestep . in order to calculate @xmath101",
    "we first consider the probability of transition , @xmath102 , from an quasienergy eigenstate @xmath103 to a quasienergy eigenstate @xmath104 in a single timestep .",
    "in fact , if @xmath105 then we may write @xmath106 the propagator in the quasienergy representation is therefore required , and the master equation ( [ master ] ) maybe be rewritten @xmath107 where @xmath108 and similarly for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "one easily finds @xmath111 thus , because of equations ( [ probsr1 ] ) and ( [ quasiprop ] ) , we find @xmath112 we can now use this expression to calculate @xmath101 by summing over all possible final states , @xmath113 ( different from @xmath114 ) and averaging over the various possible initial states ( see , for example , reference @xcite ) : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the dimension of the truncated basis ( see section [ section4 ] ) . inserting equation ( [ probsr2 ] ) and using the fact that @xmath117 we find @xmath118 where we have defined @xmath119 here we have denoted the centre of localization by @xmath120 and @xmath45 is the localization length defined previously in equation ( [ loclength ] ) .",
    "however , not every such eigenstate has this structure , as certain ",
    "double - hump \" quasienergy eigenstates exist , so - called because they have two localization centres .    for accuracy",
    "therefore , we have calculated @xmath101 numerically and examined the effect changing @xmath18 , @xmath48 and @xmath121 , the environmental inverse temperature .",
    "we present our results in section [ section4 ] .",
    "we would like now to examine the classical limit of our system . to do",
    "so we choose to work in the wigner representation for a phase space with the topology of a cylinder .",
    "the notation in this section is exactly that used in refs.@xcite , in the latter of which this representation is succinctly descibed .    the wigner distribution on our cylindrical phase space at time @xmath34 , @xmath122 , consists of @xmath123-functions concentrated on the definite values of momentum , @xmath124 , for @xmath29 an integer .",
    "one therefore writes @xmath125 for the wigner distribution at this time .",
    "its ( one ) time - step generator , @xmath126 , is defined by @xmath127 and can be expressed in terms of the one - step density matrix propagator , most conveniently in the momentum representation , using @xmath128 \\ } \\nonumber \\\\ \\times g ( m_{1 } , m_{2 } , l_{1 } , l_{2 } ) .",
    "\\label{rhotow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it will be convenient to make the transformation from the density matrix propagator to the wigner function propagator for both the free and the kicked part separately . a convolution of the two will then yield the desired quantized map in the wigner function representation .",
    "use of equation ( [ gf ] ) in equation ( [ rhotow ] ) gives @xmath129 i.e. , proportional to a periodic gaussian with period 1 .",
    "here , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are defined by @xmath132 and @xmath133 this periodic gaussian reduces to a periodic @xmath123-function with the argument @xmath134 for @xmath135 , as expected .",
    "similarly , use of equation ( [ gk ] ) in equation ( [ rhotow ] ) gives @xmath136 there remains only to convolute the two propagators to give @xmath137    when @xmath81 and @xmath138 this quantum map can be shown @xcite to reduce to the classical map of equation ( [ classmap ] ) , as required .",
    "we now present the results of our numerical calculations . for each run",
    "we began with an initial coherent state centred at some point @xmath139 in phase space .",
    "we choose planck s constant , @xmath140 to be a rational multiple of @xmath141 this avoids any resonances @xcite , which might occur between the frequency of the driving force and those frequencies associated with the energy levels , @xmath142 , of the unperturbed , regular rotor for rational @xmath140 .",
    "( such resonances give rise to a superdiffusive , quadratic increase of the rotor s energy with time in contrast to the linear increase found for the classical rotor . ) the infinite dimensionality of the hilbert space forces us to truncate the momentum basis in which we work .",
    "we have chosen , for the generation of the results presented below , to use a truncated basis set which is symmetric about the zero momentum eigenstate .",
    "that is , we have used the set @xmath143 , where @xmath34 was chosen large enough to keep the density matrix normalized to an accuracy of better than 1 part in @xmath144 ; i.e. @xmath145 = 1,\\ ] ] for the time of interest .",
    "typically , @xmath34 ranged from @xmath146 up to @xmath147 , depending on the parameter values used .    a propagation through one time step was then effected by computing equation ( [ fprop ] ) followed by equation ( [ kprop ] ) . at each stage",
    "the von neumann entropy , @xmath1 was calculated by using the approximation @xmath148 \\approx -   \\sum_{i = -n}^{n } \\lambda_{i } \\ln \\lambda_{i},\\ ] ] where @xmath149 is the set of eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath150 at that time .",
    "the entropy is a maximum if and when each @xmath151 , giving an upper limit to the entropy of @xmath152 as a result of the truncation .    finally , as we wish to investigate the modified conjecture it is reasonable to make the same characterisation for our environment as zurek and paz @xcite .",
    "the spectral density is ohmic but a high temperature environment is also required .",
    "consequently , the parameters are chosen so that @xmath153 .",
    "when the nonlinearity parameter , @xmath18 , of our rotor is greater than or equal to 6 there are no discernable stable islands in phase space plots of the classical standard map .",
    "they do still exist , of course , but the fraction of the unit square they occupy at these values is small . in such a situation",
    "the variation in the lyapunov exponent will be small throughout phase space and the inverted oscillator model will be more likely to be considered adequate .",
    "however , when the value of @xmath18 is so small as to allow kam islands to exist and occupy a significant fraction of phase space we must expect the _",
    "lyapunov exponents to vary considerably .",
    "all of these local lyapunov exponents contribute to the sum in the calculation of the _ global _ ks entropy in equation ( [ modcon ] ) .",
    "however , we can also define a _",
    "ks entropy by _ restricting _ the sum over local lyapunov exponents to those corresponding to the points in an initial classical probability distribution .",
    "thus , in view of the aim of this investigation , we might expect that the rate of von neumann entropy increase will depend strongly upon precisely where in a mixed space we locate an initial coherent state , i.e. upon the local ks entropy corresponding to its classically analogous initial probability distribution .    to illustrate the usefulness of the local ks entropy concept we considered first of all the time evolution of two initially gaussian , symmetric probability distributions in phase space , one centred in a classically regular region when @xmath154 , with the other centred in a chaotic region for the same @xmath18 value .",
    "the variance of these distributions was chosen as @xmath155 in order to render them classical analogues of the minimum uncertainty quantum initial states to which their evolutions will be compared .    in figures [ [ fig1 ] ] and [ [ fig2 ] ]",
    "we plot the result of taking 100 sample points from each of these distributions and plotting the first 300 points of the classical trajectories corresponding to each such point .",
    "the regularity of the dynamics in figure [ [ fig1 ] ] , where the initial state is centred at @xmath156 , @xmath140 being planck s constant as before , can be compared to the chaotic trajectories in figure [ [ fig2 ] ] resulting from the initial state being centred at @xmath157 .",
    "our next step is to calculate the ks entropy @xcite corresponding to each of the points used to sample the gaussians and then to take the average .",
    "this we define as the local ks entropy corresponding to the initial states .",
    "the calculations are done for a range of @xmath18 values from @xmath77 to @xmath158 giving rise to progressively less mixed phase spaces . in figure [ [ fig3 ] ]",
    "we see that this _ local _ ks entropy differs greatly for these two states when @xmath159 , i.e. after a significant number of invariant kam curves have been destroyed and before the @xmath18 value at which the kam island surrounding the elliptic fixed point at the origin disappears completely from phase space plots @xcite . as @xmath18 increases",
    "further these local ks entropies agree more and more , and can be well approximated by the _",
    "ks entropy @xcite of equation ( [ ksent ] ) .",
    "though global ks entropy can , of course , be defined for _ all _ values of @xmath18 , it must be numerically determined when a largely mixed phase space prevails .",
    "we show here , however , that it is not the quantity to be used in any prediction of the quantum mechanical entropy production rate .",
    "the correct quantity is the local ks entropy .    to show this we next considered the quantum mechanical time evolution of the two coherent states analagous to the two classical distibutions used above . for each state",
    "we have calculated the von neumann entropy production rate over 20 time steps and for the set @xmath160 , values at which the locally calculated ks entropies differ greatly ( see figure [ [ fig3 ] ] ) .",
    "the results corresponding to the initial , classically regular state centred at @xmath156 can be seen in figure [ [ fig4 ] ] and those corresponding to the ( classically chaotic ) state centred at @xmath157 can be seen in figure [ [ fig5 ] ] . in the former case",
    "the entropy production rates reflect very well the local ks entropy values of figure [ [ fig3 ] ] .",
    "the initially low values of each , when @xmath161 , increase when @xmath162 , once more when @xmath163 , and finally jump dramatically when @xmath164 . however , the situation for the coherent state situated initially in a classically chaotic region of phase space is strikingly different .",
    "indeed , the steady increase in plateau height with @xmath18 mirrors well the local ks entropy of figure [ [ fig3 ] ] as it , too , increases steadily with @xmath18 .",
    "no sudden jumps are apparent , and only when @xmath164 do the entropy production rates of both initial states approach one another , just as they do classically .      entropy production ,",
    "thus , _ does _ depend on where we initially place our coherent state but we expect this variability to decrease with increasing values of @xmath18 as the classical phase space becomes more uniformly chaotic .",
    "however , the initial states for @xmath154 we have considered above have been well localized ( figures [ [ fig1 ] ] and [ [ fig2 ] ] ) in either entirely regular or entirely chaotic regions , with no significant overlap with nearby regions which may have very different classical behaviour . in order to investigate the effect significant overlaps have on the rate of entropy production we set @xmath163 , where , as can be seen from the classical phase space plot of figure [ [ fig6 ] ] , one large regular region still exists in a sea of chaotic trajectories .",
    "if we locate our initial coherent states along the diagonal which intercepts this kam island , with their centres equally spaced at @xmath165 , we find an interesting feature .",
    "the rate of entropy increase is lower when the initial state overlaps the regular region and only when a significant overlap exists initially with the chaotic sea does the entropy begin to increase at the robust rate which is found for all the states with little or no overlap with this island .",
    "classically we see analagous behaviour once more if we examine the locally averaged ks entropy for initial distributions which correspond in their mean and variance to those quantum states of figure [ [ fig7 ] ] .",
    "we show the results of this calculation in figure [ [ fig8 ] ] . here , as in the quantum case , an asymptotic approach to a constant ks entropy value ( of @xmath166 ) is found as the initial distibution overlaps to a lesser degree with the stable kam island .",
    "it seems , therefore , that entropy production is indeed a suitable criterion by which to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion .",
    "recently zarum and sarkar @xcite produced qualitative evidence in support of this claim for the kicked rotor model .",
    "they quantized on a torus and perturbed the rotor in a different , but noisy and non - unitary way , leading to an entropy increase .",
    "initial coherent states uniformly distributed on the torus gave rise to a corresponding distribution of ( constant ) entropy production rates which reflect in a remarkable way the classical ks entropy profile for initial points in a mixed phase space .",
    "similar results have recently been obtained for the quantum kicked top model @xcite .",
    "the _ quantitative _ analysis of the relation between @xmath167 and @xmath9 has been the goal of this paper and we now turn our attention to it .",
    "firstly we examine the effect that increasing the environmental temperature has on quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "to do so we have once more iterated in time a normally distributed initial classical state consisting of 25000 points .",
    "the distribution was chosen to be centred at the same point , and to have the same variance , as a minimum uncertainty quantum state centred at @xmath168 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath169 and @xmath162 to examine the correspondence in time between the classical average value and the quantum expectation value of the squared momentum variable in figure [ [ fig9 ] ] .",
    "clearly , the classical behaviour , marked with stars ( @xmath170 ) , is approached to a greater degree as the temperature is increased ( equivalently , as @xmath171 is decreased ) despite the fact that @xmath48 _ remains fixed_.    now , in figure [ [ fig10 ] ] we examine , for the same parameters , the consequences for the rate of von neumann entropy production and in figure [ [ fig11 ] ] the consequences for the von neumann entropy itself . the truncated basis chosen for these runs as @xmath172 .    for inverse temperatures @xmath173 and @xmath174 , and for the time regime shown",
    ", we find that the von neumann entropy is not near enough to the saturation value for the linearity of its increase with time to be affected .",
    "eventually , however , the entropy will begin to saturate even for these low temperatures and the rates of entropy increase will fall below that of their respective  plateaux \" shown in figure [ [ fig10 ] ] . a feature _ not _ expected on the basis of the inverted oscillator model @xcite , and yet clearly in evidence here , is the dependence on temperature of the plateau height .",
    "hence the need for a _ modified _ conjecture to take this effect into account .",
    "when we increase the temperature still further , so that @xmath175 , we note two generic features .",
    "firstly , the time at which the approximately constant entropy production is attained , i.e. the time at which the plateau begins , decreases with the increase in temperature .",
    "this is due to the greater effectiveness of high - temperature environments in destroying quantum coherence .",
    "secondly , we note that the plateau exists for a shorter length of time as the temperature is increased .",
    "this is because the increase in the plateau height due to the increase in temperature causes the entropy to approach its saturation value at an earlier time ( by @xmath176 here ) .",
    "we note that the first of these features was mentioned by zurek and paz in the framing of their original conjecture @xcite .",
    "they also expected a finite lifetime for the plateaux due to saturation effects .",
    "however , the increase of plateau height with temperature seen here shortens this lifetime still further , making the plateaux seem more and more like maxima as the temperature is increased .    for the highest temperature chosen , with @xmath177 , we see that the initial coherence is lost so quickly as to render the dynamical localization mechanism ineffective .",
    "indeed , a linear increase of @xmath178 with the time , @xmath179 , is seen in figure [ [ fig9 ] ] at this temperature , albeit at a lower rate than the classical value .",
    "this discrepancy , however , disappears as the temperature is increased still further . with regard to entropy and its production rate",
    "we see the above - mentioned features strikingly displayed : the entropy production rate has a maximum rather than a plateau ; this maximum is greater than the plateaux heights of lower temperatures , and the maximum is reached at the shorter time of @xmath180 .      evidence that increasing one or more of the temperature , @xmath140 and @xmath18 , the magnitude of the kick , destroys the quantum coherence more efficiently can be seen in figures [ [ fig12 ] ] and [ [ fig13 ] ] .",
    "there we have plotted the single - step decay probability , @xmath101 , described in section [ section3 ] against @xmath18 , for different temperatures ( figure [ [ fig12 ] ] ) and values of the quantum of action ( figure [ [ fig13 ] ] ) .",
    "these figures clearly indicate that to destroy the dynamical localization mechanism more efficiently one should change these parameters in this way in order to reduce the coherence time , @xmath181 .",
    "furthermore , by increasing @xmath18 and decreasing @xmath140 we also increase the value of the break time , @xmath42 , according to equation ( [ breaktime ] ) .",
    "this gives the environment  more time \" to act as the situation @xmath182 develops .",
    "these observations are important in any consideration of the rate at which the system produces entropy .",
    "entropy production in the system is a manifestation of the increase in phase space area ( or volume for higher dimensional systems ) that a wave packet occupies when it is perturbed by an environment .",
    "localization , therefore , and the consequent restrictions this places on the extent to which this area can increase , _ must _ be considered as a factor which can affect the entropy .",
    "we note that the inverted oscillator model , notwithstanding its usefulness as a guide to intuition , can not take this effect into account .      in order to examine the validity or otherwise of the modified conjecture we plot , in figures [ [ fig14 ] ] to [ [ fig18 ] ] , the constant rate of von neumann entropy production , @xmath167 , versus the corresponding , classical , local ks entropy for given initial states , with different environmental parameters and values of the quantum of action .    in figure [ [ fig14 ] ]",
    "we see a linear relationship but with _ oscillations superimposed_. here , @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "evidence that these oscillations have their origin in the dynamical localization mechanism can be gathered from the fact that the values of @xmath18 at which the plot departs most from linear behaviour are precisely those values for which the quasilinear approximation to the classical diffusion coefficient , @xmath22 , is worst ( see equation ( [ dk ] ) and references @xcite ) .",
    "thus , on account of the link between both the localization length , @xmath45 , and the break time , @xmath42 , given by equations ( [ loclength ] ) and ( [ breaktime ] ) , respectively , and the classical diffusion coefficient , we see that these values of @xmath18 give rise to exceptionally small or large localization lengths and break times .",
    "this , for the reason given above , affects the rate of entropy production .    to investigate this effect",
    "further we have increased the temperature tenfold in figure [ [ fig15 ] ] , i.e. @xmath185 .",
    "we have also chosen to start initial minimum uncertainty states at five different points in phase space .",
    "since the quasienergy eigenstates form a complete set , each initial state can be expanded in this basis and will have different expansion coefficients .",
    "differing levels of importance will then be attached to the various basis states for each initial condition .",
    "since the localization length varies from eigenstate to eigenstate we might therefore expect to see slightly different entropy production rates for each such state , but with the linear behaviour still clearly in evidence .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "we also note that the slope of the graph has increased with the increase in temperature .    running at higher temperatures when @xmath183 as in figures [ [ fig14 ] ] and [ [ fig15 ] ] quickly leads to undesirable saturation effects",
    "so we henceforth choose @xmath169 and examine the interplay between dynamical localization and the modified conjecture with this larger value for the quantum of action .    in figures [ [ fig16 ] ] , [ [ fig17 ] ] and [ [ fig18 ] ] we have done just that , but for values of the inverse temperature of @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "the starting point was chosen as @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the same parameter values are used here for values of @xmath18 from @xmath188 to @xmath189 as were used in figures [ [ fig9 ] ] , [ [ fig10 ] ] and [ [ fig11 ] ] for @xmath162 .",
    "figure [ [ fig9 ] ] , especially , should give one an indication of the increased effectiveness of a larger environmental temperature in destroying the dynamical localization .",
    "this is manifest in these figures .",
    "as the temperature is increased we see a transition from quite a poor linear relationship in figure [ [ fig16 ] ] with large fluctuations due to the existence of a localization effect ( especially for smaller @xmath18 values ) to obviously much better linear relationships in figure [ [ fig17 ] ] and [ [ fig18 ] ] .",
    "the fluctuations , though still present , are much reduced at these temperatures since there is now little or no localization to inhibit the spread of the evolving wave packet in the momentum direction .",
    "once again we see that increasing the temperature has the effect of raising the slope .",
    "we have shown that the rate of von neumann entropy production for an initial state of the open quantum kicked rotor increases approximately linearly with the _ local _ ks entropy of a corresponding classical distribution .",
    "this approximation becomes more exact as the strength of the environment becomes great enough to destroy on a short enough timescale those quantum coherences which lead to dynamical localization in the absence of an environment .",
    "however , even in that  transition \" region when the localization is just noticably destroyed , linear behaviour is observed , albeit with localization - induced fluctuations superimposed .",
    "we have also shown using this model , but believe it to be generally true given its prototypical nature , that : _ a ) _ it is generally the case that the more classically chaotic a system is , the greater the rate its quantum counterpart will lose information to a perturbing environment ; _ b ) _ all system and environmental parameters being equal , different entropy production rates can still be seen depending on where one places the initial state in phase space .",
    "these locations correlate excellently with the classical mixed phase space structure , and finally ; _ c ) _ the constant rate of entropy increase depends very much on the nature and strength of the perturbing environment .",
    "we note that observation _",
    "b ) _ here is not unique to the approach of coupling quantum chaotic systems to a thermal environment , as has been done here , or of otherwise perturbing it @xcite . indeed ,",
    "recently mirbach and korsch @xcite have introduced a phase space entropy - like quantity , @xmath190 , which measures the ( time averaged ) spreading of mimimum uncertainty wave packets centred initially at @xmath139 .",
    "no environment is introduced in their approach .",
    "contour plots of this quantity show increasing similarities to both the classical phase space structure of poincar sections of a harmonically driven rotor , and to a suitably defined _ classical _ phase space entropy , as @xmath48 is decreased .",
    "however , no connection is made with standard quantities used in the study of chaos , such as the ks entropy considered here .    these results , we speculate ,",
    "provide good criteria by which to distinguish between the quantum mechanical counterparts of regular and chaotic classical motion in general , even in multi - dimensional systems .",
