    "the superconductivity in rare earth ( r ) transtion metal borocarbides is of great interest@xcite , in particular its interplay with magnetism and superconductivity is fascinating@xcite .",
    "however in the following we limit ourselves to the nonmagnetic borocarbides luni@xmath0b@xmath0c  and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c  .",
    "they have a relatively high superconducting transition temperature t@xmath3=15.5 k and 16.5 k respectively .",
    "although the dominance of the s - wave component in @xmath1has been established by substituting ni by a small amount of pt and subsequent opening of the energy gap@xcite , a number of peculiarities are not expected in a conventional s- wave superconductor@xcite . for example",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the specific heat in the vortex state indicates a superconducting state with nodal excitations similar to d - wave superconductivity in high t@xmath3 cuprates@xcite .",
    "furthermore the presence of de haas van alphen ( dhva ) oscillations in the vortex state of luni@xmath0b@xmath0c  down to h=0.2h@xmath4 suggests again nodal superconductivity@xcite . in a conventional s - wave superconductor dhva oscillations would disappear for h@xmath50.8h@xmath4@xcite .",
    "in addition the upper critical field determined for luni@xmath0b@xmath0c  and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c  for field direction within the a - b plane exhibits clear fourfold symmetry somewhat reminiscent to d- wave superconductors@xcite , furthermore 1/t@xmath6 from nmr experiments shows t@xmath7 power law behaviour consistent with nodal superconductors @xcite .",
    "these experiments clearly indicate that @xmath1 in borocarbides has to be an anisotropic s- wave order parameter .",
    "furthermore a ) @xmath1has to have a nodal structure with the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) n(e)@xmath8 for @xmath9/@xmath101 , which gives the @xmath2 dependence in the specific heat of the vortex state@xcite .",
    "b ) the nodal structure has to have the fourfold symmetry within the a - b plane which is consistent with the tetragonal symmetry of the a - b plane .",
    "these two constraints appear to suggest almost uniquely    @xmath11    or s+g- wave superconductivity . here",
    "@xmath12 are the polar and azimuthal angles in @xmath13- space respectively .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 @xmath1which exhibits clear fourfold symmetry . the four second order nodal points of @xmath1are given by @xmath14 = ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) which dominate the quasiparticle dos at low energies :    @xmath17    where n@xmath18 is the normal state dos . in constructing @xmath1 ,",
    "we have made use of a similar approach as in mgb@xmath0@xcite . in the s+g model of eq.([gap ] ) we assume the equality of s and g amplitudes to have n(e)@xmath19 down to lowest energies .",
    "recent thermal conductivity measurements @xcite report a gap anisotropy of at least a factor of 10 , the fine tuning of s and g amplitudes in eq.([gap ] ) therefore has a tolerance of 10% .",
    "there is no symmetry reason why the amplitudes ( or pair potentials ) of inequivalent representations like s and g should be very close .",
    "however from the bandstructure of borocarbides @xcite it may be argued that the pair potential at the nodal points given above is indeed strongly suppressed .",
    "the main fermi surface sheet shows lobe like structures along the [ 110 ] directions which have strong nesting with a wave vector parallel to a. this wave vector appears as the incommensurate ordering vector in the magnetic borocarbides ( lu , y replaced by rare earth elements ) . therefore the lobe states at ( @xmath20)=(@xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) tend to an instability in the particle - hole channel which strongly depresses the effective potential and associated @xmath1for cooper pairing at these points .",
    "the approximate fine tuning ( up to 10% ) of s and g amplitudes may be caused by this peculiar fermi surface feature of the borocarbides .    in the following",
    "we shall first consider thermodynamics and transport of the borocarbides for zero field for the proposed gap function .",
    "then we will study the field angle dependence of specific heat and thermal conductivity which exhibit the fourfold symmetry .",
    "we apply the same technique developed in ref .",
    "[ ] . also we predict the fourfold symmetry in the excess dingle temperature in the vortex state in borocarbides in a planar magnetic field .",
    "first of all @xmath1=@xmath21f(*k * ) given in eq.([gap ] ) leads to the quasiparticle density of states    @xmath22    where x = e/@xmath21 and    @xmath23    we note that f(1-y)=f(y ) holds .",
    "the quasiparticle density of states is evaluated numerically and shown in fig.2 .",
    "for @xmath9/@xmath101 we obtain    @xmath24    then the low temperature specific heat is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the sommerfeld constant .",
    "similarly the spin susceptibility and the superfluid density are given by@xcite    @xmath27    likewise the electronic thermal conductivity of the s+g model at low temperature is obtained in a universal form as    @xmath28    the prefactor @xmath29/8 is specific for the s+g model . here",
    "n , m are the electronic density and mass respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath30 = @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the normal state thermal conductivity and @xmath33 the quasiparticle scattering rate .",
    "the linear t behaviour of @xmath34 has recently been found @xcite in luni@xmath0b@xmath0c  from which we extract @xmath35 0.02 .",
    "we are proposing that the angular dependent specific heat and especially thermal conductivity in the vortex state provides a unique window to look for the symmetry of @xmath1@xcite . indeed from the latter izawa et al have succeded in deducing the symmetry of @xmath1 in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath36@xcite , cecoin@xmath37@xcite and more recently @xmath34-(et)@xmath0cu(ncs)@xmath0@xcite .",
    "first of all we have to construct the equation for the residual density of states in the presence of impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "@xmath38    where c@xmath18=@xmath39 ) with @xmath40 giving the renormalized frequency and x= @xmath41/@xmath21 @xmath42 . here",
    "2@xmath43 is the sum of the pair momentum associated with a supercurrent circulating around each vortex and @xmath44 is the doppler shift connected with it . in the first line",
    "the brackets mean averaging over both fermi surface and vortex lattice , in the second line the former is evaluated up to the @xmath45 summation and the latter still remains . in the superclean limit defined by c@xmath46 or @xmath47 eq.([gfunc ] ) gives    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and i(@xmath50)=@xmath51 for 0@xmath52 .",
    "the function i(@xmath50 ) is shown in fig .",
    "3 . here v@xmath53 and v@xmath3 are fermi velocities in the a - b plane and along the c - axis respectively .",
    "the magnetic field is applied within the a - b plane at an angle @xmath50 with respect to the a axis .    in the clean limit with c@xmath54 or @xmath55 on the other hand",
    "we obtain    @xmath56\\bigr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from these expressions the field angular dependent specific heat in the vortex state may be derived . in the superclean limit",
    "we obtain    @xmath57    in the clean limit on the other hand the above @xmath50 dependence is replaced by    @xmath58\\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where g(0)=n(0)/n@xmath18 in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the thermal conductivity tensor in the vortex phase has been calculated in @xcite and in a planar magnetic field it is given by    @xmath59    in the superclean limit and    @xmath60 \\\\ \\frac{\\kappa_{xy}}{\\kappa_0}&= & -\\frac{\\tilde{v}^2(eh)}{12\\gamma\\delta}\\sin(2\\theta ) \\ln(2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma}})\\ln(\\frac{\\delta}{\\tilde{v}\\sqrt{eh } } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the clean limit . here",
    "@xmath61 is @xmath62(h=0 ) .",
    "therefore we expect the fourfold symmetry in the thermal conductivity in the vortex state should be readily accessible in future experiments . on the other hand @xmath62 has recently been measured for field oriented along c @xcite . in this case",
    "a similar calculation in the superclean limit for h@xmath63 h@xmath4 leads to    @xmath64    this behaviour was indeed experimentally observed in @xcite . in the clean limit @xmath62(h ) is no longer exactly linear but has a logarithmic correction in h. since @xmath350.02 for luni@xmath0b@xmath0c  we can use the above equation for the superclean limit except for very small fields .",
    "it is well known that dhva oscillations can be seen in the vortex state as well when the quasiparticle damping is much less than the cyclotron frequency@xcite .",
    "however in conventional s - wave superconductors the dhva oscillation becomes invisible when h@xmath650.8 h@xmath4 .",
    "therefore if dhva oscillations are seen even for h@xmath660.2h@xmath4 as in the case of luni@xmath0b@xmath0c  @xcite , this can be taken as a signature of a nodal superconductor . since the excess dingle temperature in the vortex state is due to quasiparticle damping caused by the andreev scattering it should also exhibit the fourfold symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the excess damping due to andreev scattering is evaluated as    @xmath67    where we defined    @xmath68    that is we average @xmath69 on the fermi surface sliced perpendicular to @xmath70 .",
    "the angular dependence of j(@xmath50 ) is shown in fig .",
    "3 together with i(@xmath50 ) .",
    "in particular we find i(@xmath71)/i(0)= @xmath72 and j(@xmath71)/j(0)= 0.2587 .",
    "the excess damping is reduced by a factor of @xmath73 for @xmath74 [ 1,1,0 ] as compared to the one for @xmath74 [ 1,0,0 ] for example .",
    "here we propose a simple model for @xmath1for nonmagnetic borocarbide superconductors with fourfold symmetry .",
    "the angular dependence of the specific heat , thermal conductivity and the excess dingle temperature are worked out with this model .",
    "we hope that this work will stimulate further experiments on borocarbide superconductors .",
