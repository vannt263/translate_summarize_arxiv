    "our algorithm generates a random non - crossing pair partition and then uses the node identifications of this pair partition to assign adjacencies in the toothpick subgraph of the associated three - regular graph .",
    "non - crossing pair partitions are formed recursively .",

    "the first node of each of these sets is then paired using the same algorithm .",
    "this process is repeated until all nodes have been paired .",
    "the number of non - crossing pair partition on @xmath8 nodes is given by the catalan number , @xmath40 which can be defined recursively as @xmath41 let @xmath42 be the random variable representing the node paired with node one in a non - crossing pair partition . since the pair partition is non - crossing , odd nodes must be paired with even nodes . the number of non - crossing pair partitions on @xmath8 nodes in which the first node is paired with node @xmath42 is equal to the number of non - crossing pair partitions on @xmath43 elements times the number of non - crossing pair partitions on @xmath44 elements , @xmath45 .",

    "our algorithm was implemented using matlab . with each recursive call to our program , we assign a pairing to the first element of some subset of the entire pair partition .",
    "these subsets are determined by the previously assigned pairs . for the example shown in figure [ ncppalg ] ,",
    "after the first pairing is assigned , the partition is divided into two subsets of lengths @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "[ ncppalg ] ]      as previously discussed , randomly choosing a genus zero one - face map having @xmath34 edges is equivalent to randomly choosing a non - crossing pair partition on @xmath8 nodes .",
    "the number of non - crossing pair partitions on @xmath8 nodes is @xmath58 .",

    "the probability our algorithm constructs partition @xmath19 is equal to the probability of node 1 being paired to node @xmath42 , times the probability of the particular non - crossing pair partition @xmath63 on the @xmath43 nodes internal to the pairing 1:@xmath42 , times the probability of the particular non - crossing pair partition @xmath2 on the @xmath44 nodes external to the pairing 1:@xmath42 . by our supposition",

    "these results are unsurprising given that samples of random one - face maps for large @xmath34 exhibit the same properties and are comprised primarily of maps having genera near @xmath67 .",
    "corresponding to one - face maps having @xmath69 edges .",

    "the eigenvalue density curves for various samples of genus zero one - face maps are plotted on the same axis .",
    "although the number of embedded edges @xmath34 is different for each sample , the eigenvalue densities are nearly identical .",
    "while this distribution is the same for all large values of @xmath34 , it does not appear to be described by any established density formula .",
    "examining the eigenvalues themselves , we find that the peaks observed in the density curve near @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not the result of repeated eigenvalues , but rather a decrease in spacing between consecutive eigenvalues .",
    "the non - crossing structure of the toothpick portion of the three - regular graphical representation of genus zero one - face maps ensures that the graphs are bipartite .",

    "[ meanjthspac ] ]    it is clear from these results that , in the genus zero case , the distribution of eigenvalues is not described by the mckay density formula . in fact , three - regular graphs representing genus zero one face maps violate the criteria of mckay s theorem ( [ mckay ] ) .",
    "these graphs are always planar , i.e. they can be drawn in the plane in such a way that the edges of the graph do not intersect except at vertex points .",

    "all other faces are bounded by the edges of the graph , and are called _ internal _ faces .    ]    for genus zero one - face maps , the embedded graph is a planar tree , and each internal face of the associated three - regular graph corresponds to a vertex of this embedded tree .",
    "the degree of this embedded vertex is equal to @xmath83 the face boundary length .",
    "thus , the distribution of vertex degrees in the genus zero embedded trees determines the distribution of face boundary lengths in the associated three - regular graph .",
    "furthermore , since each face boundary forms a cycle in the graph , the number of vertices of degree @xmath84 in the tree provides a lower bound for the number of @xmath85 cycles in the three - regular graph .",

    "the scaled spacings in the genus zero case are not described by the goe density formula which was shown numerically to describe the bulk scaling limit for genera near @xmath67 , but rather appear to be described by the exponential probability density function .",
    "the numerical results suggest that the eigenvalue statistics depend on the rigidity of the associated three - regular graph . for one - face maps having small genus relative to @xmath34 , a great deal of structure",

    "we believe the striking difference between the eigenvalue statistics of genus zero maps and genus @xmath78 is a result of this imposed structure . for any fixed genus , as the size of the map increases ( i.e. the number of vertices in the associated three - regular graph grows ) , more structure will be imposed on the associated three - regular graph .",
