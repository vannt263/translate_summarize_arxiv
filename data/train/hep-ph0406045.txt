    "higher order radiative corrections are usually necessary to obtain from standard model high precision results for phenomenologically important quantities .",
    "the techniques of direct calculations , lead to expressions , of often hundreds , thousands or even million s of terms .",
    "these are difficult to control analytically and/or numerically .",
    "this is worrisome , because to obtain phenomenologically sound results third order effects are mandatory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is clearly outside the reach of presently available methods of direct perturbative calculations .",
    "there is no doubt , that resummation is necessary of at least some contributions from orders higher than the second one .    in case of electroweak processes at lep techniques based on exclusive exponentiation of qed effects turned out to be powerful and enabled high precision predictions for a wide game of processes , such as bhabha scattering , production of heavy bosons @xmath2 or @xmath5 and lepton pairs .",
    "the underlying method , originating from pioneering work of yennie frautschi and suura @xcite turned out to be realizable @xcite in practice , thanks to acumulated experience and ever increasing computer power .",
    "one of the necessary elements in approach based on exponentiation is rigorous study of matrix elements obtained from perturbative calculation .",
    "in fact it is not enough to calculate predictions at as high order of perturbation expansion as possible , but also to carefully separate results into infrared singular and remaining finite parts .",
    "thanks to the properties of qed , results of explicit perturbative calculations are not necessary to obtain singular and leading terms of every order .",
    "these leading parts of amplitudes can be combined with the phase space into the module of the low level monte carlo generator or in general into multi - dimensional distribution which can be understood as lowest order of improved perturbative expansion . later , finite parts of the matrix elements can be added order by order . in case of monte carlo algorithms it can be done with the help of the correcting weight , which can be shown to be positive and bound from above .",
    "details of such a rigorous scheme can be found in refs .",
    "it improves significantly the convergence of perturbative expansion ; final states with arbitrary number of photons are present already at the lowest level of expansion .",
    "this allows for predictions with realistic experimental cut - offs included .",
    "the solution based on separation performed at the amplitude level , is specially useful .",
    "it opens the way for easy implementation of all sort of interferences , also convergence of expansion is particularly fast in this case .",
    "the underlying exponentiation scheme is called coherent exclusive exponentiation ( ceex ) .",
    "the following point is of practical importance . in case of exponentiation , already at the lowest order of expansion , configurations with multiple real photons",
    "are present .",
    "that is why , it may happen , that for particular event , there is more explicit photons in final state , than in expression directly available from standard perturbative expansion .",
    "reduction / extrapolation methods are then necessary .",
    "we will not elaborate much on theoretical aspects of this point here .",
    "however let us stress that if sufficiently high order of perturbation expansion is available , dependence on the choice of reduction procedure or extrapolation is dropping out .",
    "particularly bad choice may nonetheless degrade convergence of expansion .",
    "it is thus of the importance to provide results of perturbative calculations in a form as convenient for extrapolation procedure as possible .",
    "comparisons of amplitudes calculated at different orders of perturbative expansion can provide a useful hint .",
    "in the present paper , we heavily rely on ref .",
    "we will assume certain level of familiarity of the reader with that reference . also , let us note that spin amplitudes for the process @xmath4 are well defined within the standard model and known since long , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we could profit in our work from the ready to use computer codes such as @xcite available for numerical cross checks of our results .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the case of single bremsstrahlung @xmath6 , some basic elements of spin amplitude techniques , useful in the more complex case of double bremsstrahlung are presented there as well . in section 3 , we provide the main results , in particular we explicitly identify gauge invariant parts of the amplitudes .",
    "we stress points which will be useful for extrapolation schemes used in ceex exponentiation as well .",
    "we keep our discussion , having in mind future applications in spin - amplitude automated programs . in section 4",
    "we discuss issues related to extrapolation procedure in more detail .",
    "finally , section 5 closes the paper .",
    "let us start with the well - known and straightforward to calculate by any method spin amplitude for the @xmath7 single - photon bremsstrahlung process , see fig  [ fig : bremi ] .",

    "this part of the amplitude is infrared singular .",
    "we will use the factorization of the soft factors explained here , also later in the paper .",
    "note that in case of single photon @xmath5 exchange amplitude , we got only three gauge invariant parts : infrared - singular , and two others contributing to collinear - singular terms ( after phase space integration ) .",
    "the residual ( contributing only non enhanced terms after phase space integration ) terms are absent .",
    "note however , that they are present in case of the @xmath2 exchange diagrams .",
    "finally let us comment that similar pattern of amplitude separation into gauge invariant parts can be observed for @xmath98 in @xcite .",
    "in the present section we will study the amplitudes for double bremsstrahlung in @xmath99 production process .",
    "there are two classes of diagrams in this case , the first one with @xmath5 boson exchange in @xmath77 channel and the second one with @xmath1 channel @xmath2 exchange .",
    "similarly as in previous section and single bremsstrahlung we will look if gauge invariant parts of the complete amplitude can be defined",
    ". we will be also interested , if this can be done in a semi - automatic way , directly from the feynman rules .",
    "the presentation of the complete amplitudes is rather difficult because of their length . to avoid lengthy formulas",
    ", we will start with largely incomplete set of diagrams , nonetheless sufficient to localize some gauge invariant group of terms .",
    "once localized , it will be hidden under symbol @xmath100 and , to the remaining part contributions from the next diagrams will be added .",
    "again gauge invariant group of terms will be searched for .",
    "this procedure will be repeated until the complete list of diagrams of our process will be exhausted .",
    "the choice for the first diagram in this procedure is motivated by its particular ( unique ) form , later it is motivated by the form of the gauge dependent rest remaining from the previous step . for short hand notations",
    "we will use extended subscripts and superscripts for @xmath100 .",
    "for example we will use symbol @xmath101 , to denote contribution for the diagram with : first photon of momentum @xmath12 and second @xmath102 , attached to incoming @xmath57 line .",
    "the number @xmath103 in bracket ( if present ) will denote that it is only a part of the contribution from the particular feynman diagram ( or diagrams ) .",
    "there will be often bar over this number to point that the particular part is gauge dependent .",
    "let us start our iteration with diagrams involving double fermion propagator , that is diagrams where two photons are attached either to incoming electron or to incoming positron .",
    "these are the _ only _ diagrams with @xmath104 term in fermion propagators .",
    "our first aim will be thus to localize the parts which are gauge invariant by themselves , and include this @xmath104 term .",

    "would be needed .",
    "if conclusive , it would point to solutions beyond next - to - leading - log approximation , thus beyond imminent interest of the present paper .",
    "the gauge invariance was not the only element of the criterium which was used here to split amplitude into gauge invariant parts .",
    "equally important was that the two main sources of the radiation , incoming beams , form the unambiguous frame with respect to which , photon energy and the angles of photons with respect to fermions could be defined .",

    "let us summarize here some specific issues related to extrapolation procedure of ceex scheme described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for purely @xmath77-channel hard process .",
    "one of the important property of perturbation expansion , rearranged to improve convergence into exclusive exponentiation , is that parts of the amplitudes need to be appropriately shifted between the rearranged orders of expansion .",
    "we will concentrate on issues related to real bremsstrahlung only .",
    "in particular parts of the higher order terms ( directly calculated in a standard way ) which are already available at lower level of ceex perturbation expansion need to be localized and subtracted in a clear way . only remaining residual parts , called @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 etc .",
    "@xcite will be indeed the term of the given newly rearranged order .",
    "the use of @xmath230 functions is unambiguous if sufficiently high order of standard perturbative calculation is available to calculate matrix element , for the configuration with all real photons .",
    "however it is not always the case , practical solutions for exponentiation require definition of methods how to calculate matrix elements for the kinematical configuration with large number of real photons , using results of first ( or second ) order of perturbation expansion only .",
    "there are several rules which extrapolation procedure must fulfill .",
    "already the lowest order must include all terms with the highest power of infrared singularity and for all kinematical configurations of arbitrary number of real photons and in a fully exclusive manner .",
    "then , first order provide all terms with next to highest power of infrared singularity , etc .",
    "let us stress that reduction / extrapolation procedure of exponentiation offers some freedom of choice .",
    "this freedom can be used to further improve convergence of perturbation expansion .",
    "the best guidance is of course comparison with result of even higher order of expantion to minimize their contribution .",
    "if such results are not available , higher order leading log results can be used instead .",
    "finally , let us stress that if sufficiently high order of perturbation expansion is available , dependence on particular choice of extrapolation drops out and unique result , identical to the one of direct perturbation expansion without any reordering , will be obtained .",
    "unfortunately this is not expected to be the case in foreseeable future .    in case of diagrams with @xmath5 exchange",
    "the question of choice of extrapolation procedure is straightforward .",
    "inspection of first order ( formula [ isr - feynman1 ] ) and second order ( formula [ zgg - b ] ) amplitudes points to the following solution : the terms @xmath155 to @xmath156 of ( [ zgg - b ] ) should contribute to @xmath229 , whereas the last two terms @xmath158 and @xmath159 can be directly obtained from the lower order .",
    "the @xmath158 can be obtained from @xmath228 by multiplication with the soft photon factor for the other photon .",
    "the @xmath228 can be identified as this part of @xmath44 ( see formula [ isr - feynman1 ] ) which is proportional to @xmath231 .",
    "the @xmath159 can be obtained from the lowest order born spin amplitude @xmath227 of @xmath5 exchange by multiplication with two soft photon factors , for each of the bremsstrahlung photons , exactly as it should be in exponentiation prescription .",
    "the factorization properties can be easily seen if rather trivial manipulation on dirac algebra is performed .    in case of diagrams with @xmath2 exchange",
    ", the question of choice of extrapolation procedure is slightly more complex , because of dependence of the transfers used in @xmath2 propagators on photon momenta .",
    "that is also the reason why triple and quatric gauge couplings need to be included in the considerations .",
    "if the kinematical configurations of more than two explicit hard photons are taken , then the transfers calculated for @xmath2 propagators can be defined in several ways .",
    "our choice used at present in kkmc @xcite is inspired by leading log considerations .",
    "for lowest order ( @xmath227 , ) and if there was no addition photons , transfer @xmath66 , can be calculated either as ( i ) @xmath232 or ( ii ) @xmath233 .",
    "if there is a photon collinear to @xmath9 the first choice is closer to the transfer dominating higher order ( i.e. single bremsstrahlung ) spin amplitude . in general the choice ( i ) is thus more favored if total four - momentum carried out by the sum of all photons is pointing rather into direction of @xmath9 than @xmath8 .",
    "otherwise the second choice is better . in case of single ( or double ) photon emission the choice how the transfers are calculated is basically the same .",
    "the only difference is , that the photons explicitely included in the particular contribution to @xmath228 or @xmath229 , should contribute to the sum of photons mentioned above .",
    "the choice which pair of four momenta ( @xmath8 , @xmath10 or @xmath9 , @xmath11 ) is used in calculation for transfers , must be taken in calculation of algebraic expressions originating from direct @xmath2 interaction with photons , for gauge invariance to hold .",
    "we have presented complete results for the spin amplitudes of @xmath4 process . using gauge transformation , as well as expansion with respect to contact approximation for @xmath2 exchange",
    ", we were able to identify gauge invariant parts of amplitudes of the well defined physical properties .",
    "in particular the parts proportional to inverse of photon energies ( i.e. corresponding to infrared singularity ) , remaining parts proportional to inverse of the product of fermion and photon momenta ( i.e. of the type of collinear singularity ) as well as residual finite parts could be grouped together in a rather natural way . by comparison with amplitudes for the diagrams involving @xmath77-channel @xmath5 exchange we were able to observe certain pattern of universality for many of those terms .",
    "let us stress , that some of the results presented here , could be expected from the properties of u(1 ) gauge symmetry and the corresponding ward identities .",
    "they are known already since a long time , also in the context of qcd .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is mainly technical .",
    "we illustrate the scheme of step - by - step gauge cancellations and how they work for spin amplitude techniques . finally , we show , how they helped to develop extrapolation procedures used in the kk monte carlo in case of neutrino channel .",

    "<S> one of the necessary steps in constructing high precision option of kkmc was to install the double bremsstrahlung matrix element for the process @xmath0 into the scheme of coherent exclusive exponentiation . </S>",
    "<S> the process is also interesting because of gauge cancellation of contributions for photon emission from incoming fermion lines and @xmath1-channel @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the qed u(1 ) gauge properties require terms of the triple and quatric gauge couplings to be taken into considerations as well . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to expansion starting from the approximation of contact interaction , good example to study the internal structure of the amplitude is available .    in the developed scheme , natural separation of the complete amplitude into gauge invariant parts </S>",
    "<S> is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> each part has well defined physical interpretation , which after partial integration over phase space provides terms : infrared singular , leading log , next - to - leading - log , etc . </S>",
    "<S> contributions related to triple and quatric gauge coupling of @xmath2 ( extracted with the help of expansion around contact @xmath2-interaction ) , have been ordered as well . </S>",
    "<S> the separation is also helpful , to define extrapolation / reduction procedure of ceex exponentiation for the @xmath3 channel .     </S>",
