    "the evolution of a galaxy cluster comprises relaxed stretches punctuated by violent merger events affecting the gravitationally dominant dark matter ( dm ) halo , especially frequent in its early life after the initial collapse .",
    "a number of such events may be caught in action , as in the extreme case of the bullet cluster ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ; clowe et al . 2006 ) . as to the many quieter clusters",
    ", one may wonder how long and how precise a memory of similar if less dramatic events  and of the more frequent ones caused by central outbursts from active galactic nuclei ( agns )  is retained by the hot diffuse baryons constituting their intracluster plasma ( icp ) .",
    "we will show how a considerable amount of quantitative information may be retrieved even several gyrs after the event from the x - ray bremsstrahlung emission by the icp in the inner cluster regions .",
    "on the other hand , the quiet stretches when external dm and gas are smoothly accreted across the virial radius @xmath1 will shape the outer dm density and gravitational potential , and hence the icp distribution and x - ray bremsstrahlung emission in the cluster outskirts .",
    "is there any simple and comprehensive , physical modeling conducive to a precise yet fast analysis of both these regions ?",
    "we will show how indeed our supermodel ( see cavaliere , lapi & fusco - femiano 2009 , thereafter clff09 ) enables us to accurately fit the full radial profiles of the x - ray observables , namely , the temperature @xmath2 and the brightness @xmath3 that provides the baryon number density @xmath4 .",
    "whence we read out the imprints of the _ thermodynamic _ cluster history in the form of level , pattern , and time for depositions or injections of icp specific entropy @xmath5 in boltzmann units .",
    "rather than relying on entropy profiles in the literature , we will focus on deriving the radial entropy runs from fitting the modeled primary observables for which precise , resolved and robust data ( typically out to @xmath6 ) exist as is the case for the six clusters considered here .",
    "the supermodel ( sm ) straightforwardly expresses the profiles @xmath7 and @xmath2 in the entropy - modulated equilibrium of the icp within the potential wells provided by the dominant dm .",
    "these two components are related not only by their common containing well , but also by parallel accretion of surrounding dm and baryons into the cluster volume .",
    "thus the sm tells the thermal and dynamical past of a cluster back to its formation time , to include subsequent mergers or agn outbursts and current outer accretion .",
    "the sm is built upon the physical dm distributions derived by lapi & cavaliere ( 2009a ) from the jeans equation .",
    "these base on the radial run of the functional @xmath8 , namely the ` dm entropy ' , that combines the 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath9 with the density @xmath10 . from _",
    "n_-body simulations @xmath11 is found to constitute a truly universal halo feature as it always follows a powerlaw run @xmath12 throughout the halos bulk ( taylor & navarro 2001 ; dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ; hoffman et al .",

    "; navarro et al .",
    "on the other hand , lapi & cavaliere ( 2009a ) compute @xmath13 , and find it to lie in the range @xmath14 from galaxies to massive clusters , narrowed down to @xmath15 from poor ( overall mass @xmath16 a few @xmath17 ) to very rich ( @xmath16 a few @xmath18 ) clusters .",
    "two basic features of these ` @xmath13-profiles ' entering the sm frame are briefly recalled in appendix a.    we stress that our treatment of the @xmath13-profiles ( see lapi & cavaliere 2009a , b ) agrees with recent numerical simulations ( zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; diemand et al .",
    "2007 ; wang & white 2008 ) in picturing the dm halo formation as a _ two - stage _ development .",
    "the epoch @xmath19 ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 marks the halo s transition from the stage of fast violent collapse scarred by major merging events , to one of progressively smoother and slower accretion building up the outskirts with little body perturbation .    during the latter ,",
    "the dm profiles develop an increasing concentration @xmath22 , that actually measures the current outer extension out to the virial radius @xmath1 , relative to the region inner to @xmath23 where @xmath10 is flatter than @xmath24 ( see clff09 ) . starting with values @xmath25 at the transition",
    ", @xmath26 increases to current values @xmath27 , to attain values @xmath28 or more for the @xmath29 fraction of rich clusters with a transition as early as @xmath30 ( see lapi & cavaliere 2009b ) ; thus @xmath26 measures the _ dynamic _ age @xmath19 of the cluster . since @xmath1 is typically of order @xmath21 mpc , values @xmath31",
    "imply @xmath32 kpc ; in the following , we will refer to ` outskirts ' for the region @xmath33 , and to ` inner body ' for the region @xmath34 .",
    "based on the sm , we will discuss in particular how the outer distribution of the icp entropy relates to the dm concentration .",
    "the sm describes the equilibrium of the icp in the dm potential well , as we recall in   2 ; there we briefly recap the main features of the icp description in the form of the sm as developed by clff09 , with the addition of eq .",
    "( 8) that enables computing the total mass .",
    "then in ",
    "3 we describe our analysis procedure based on the sm . in ",
    "4 we apply such a procedure to the data for a set of six clusters with diverse profiles of x - ray brightness and temperature . finally , in   5 we discuss the specific physical information we extract from our analysis of the x - ray observations .    in our treatment",
    "we adopt a standard flat cosmology with normalized matter density @xmath35 , dark energy density @xmath36 and hubble constant @xmath37 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 , except when comparing with data otherwise scaled .",
    "we concentrate first on dm halos close to self - gravitational equilibrium under smooth and slow accretion , past the fast collapse stage and after any residual violent mergers , as discussed in   5 . within these dm gravitational wells ,",
    "the icp approaches hydrostatic conditions after outgoing blastwaves and shocks driven by central mergers or agn outbursts have subsided .    in such conditions ,",
    "the icp density is governed by the balance between the gravitational force and the gradient of the pressure @xmath39 ; with the latter expressed as @xmath40 in terms of icp entropy , the balance reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath43 is the proton mass , and @xmath44 is the gravitational constant .",
    "once the radial entropy run @xmath45 is given as discussed below , the solution of this @xmath46 order differential equation allowed us ( clff09 ) to write the profiles of the gas temperature and density in the form @xmath47~.\\ ] ] here barred variables are normalized to their boundary value at @xmath48 ; the squared circular velocity @xmath49 is taken from the @xmath13-profiles with their weak dependence on @xmath13 , and is expressed in appendix a in terms of hypergeometric functions ; finally , we define @xmath50 .",
    "the latter incorporates the boundary condition required for solving eq .",
    "it is physically convenient to fix such a reference value at the virial radius @xmath51 rather than at the center , where @xmath52 vanishes steeply ( see lapi & cavaliere 2009a ) while the icp is often affected by violent stochastic events such as mergers and agn outbursts .",
    "moreover , at @xmath53 closely universal accretion of external intergalactic medium ( igm ) prevails for both cool core ( cc ) and non cool core ( ncc ) clusters ; this holds to lowest order , although the related conversion of infall kinetic into thermal energy may differ somewhat related to cluster age and preheating conditions , as discussed in   3 and 5 .",
    "in fact , in the absence of substantial preheating in the igm larger than some @xmath54 kev per particle ( see lapi et al . 2005 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) , the energy conversion takes place in _",
    "strong _ accretion shocks that linger at the virial radius ( see tozzi & norman 2001 ; lapi et al . 2005",
    "; voit 2005 ) , to imply @xmath55 that takes on values around @xmath56 .",
    "these obtain from maximal conversion at a strong shock of the gravitational infall energy , that yields @xmath57 ; this quantity involves the specific kinetic energy @xmath58 gained by the igm that starts from the turning point its free fall toward @xmath1 across the potential drop @xmath59 ( see lapi et al .",
    "the latter is provided by the dm @xmath13-profiles , and is conveniently normalized to the related @xmath60 ; whence eq .",
    "( 3 ) follows .",
    "we stress that @xmath61 lowers when @xmath62 and the proportional infall kinetic energy are smaller owing to a large concentration @xmath26 ; e.g. , a value @xmath28 holding for a cluster with an early transition ( see   1 ) , in place of @xmath63 holding for clusters with a recent transition , implies @xmath64 to decrease from @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( see clff09 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath61 also lowers when a high preheating level of the igm _ weakens _ the shock and impairs the conversion efficiency as discussed by lapi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and voit ( 2005 ) .    to obtain the icp temperature and density profiles",
    "the full radial run @xmath45 of the entropy is required .",
    "its physical modeling is based upon the notions that entropy is eroded by radiative cooling on the timescale @xmath67 gyr ( sarazin 1988 ) , whilst it is enhanced by _",
    "shocks _ ; at @xmath51 it is deposited by standing accretion shocks , and in the central region is injected by outbound blastwaves terminating in a shock , as are driven by supersonic outflows from agn outbursts or head - on mergers .    in the vicinity of @xmath68 the powerlaw approximation",
    "@xmath69 always applies ( see clff09 ) with boundary value @xmath70 varying around @xmath71 . note that after eq .",
    "( 3 ) the upper bound @xmath72 obtains for large @xmath64 as then @xmath73 tends to vanish ; at the other end , @xmath74 decreases for weaker and weaker shocks corresponding to smaller @xmath62 and/or relatively stronger preheating levels .",
    "as no other major sources or sinks of entropy occur from the boundary at a few mpcs down to the central @xmath75 kpc , in the outer range the entropy is deposited and _ stratified _ during the stage of slow accretion ; thus a powerlaw radial run is set with slope @xmath76 that stays close to its boundary value @xmath74 .    at the center , instead",
    ", entropy may be intermittently injected by shocks driven by mergers reaching down there ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ; balogh et al .",
    "2007 ) , and by powerful agns residing in the central massive galaxies ( see valageas & silk 1999 ; wu et al . 2000 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; lapi et al . 2005 ) as observed and reviewed by mcnamara & nulsen ( 2007 ) and markevitch & vikhlinin ( 2007 ) .",
    "thus the full entropy profile that combines central injections with outer stratification may be described by the simple parametric expression ( see voit 2005 and references therein ) @xmath77 in fact , this approaches a constant value at small radii , and smoothly goes into a powerlaw at large radii .",
    "entropy profiles similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) have been recently reported by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) from an analysis of a _",
    "chandra _ archival sample comprising @xmath78 clusters .",
    "in fact , most of them are well fit by a power law at large radii plus a constant value @xmath79 at small radii , with a basically bimodal distribution peaked at @xmath80 kev @xmath81 and at @xmath82 kev @xmath81 .",
    "on the other hand , some clusters show evidence of a sharper entropy floor ( e.g. , pratt et al . 2005 for a2218 ; see also fig .  5 in cavagnolo et al .",
    "2009 ) that we represent not only with a level @xmath83 but also with a definite extension @xmath84 , so that the corresponding radial entropy run reads @xmath85 for @xmath86 , and as @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "the scale @xmath89 may be interpreted as the terminal radius just reached by an outbound blastwave driven by a violent energy input at the center ( see lapi et al .",
    "2005 ) ; at @xmath89 its decreasing mach number @xmath90 has decayed to unity and the blast has stalled and degraded into adiabatic sound waves , as caught in action by fabian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the perseus cluster ( see also   5 for a discussion ) . in this picture , eq .  ( 5 ) represents a later stage caused by diffusive smoothing and mixing of such a radial imprint , while the enhanced entropy level is still high before radiative erosion has set in .    from the gas temperature and density profiles given by eq .",

    "here we describe in detail how we use the sm to account for the x - ray brightness and temperature profiles for both classes of cc and ncc clusters ( molendi & pizzolato 2001 ; leccardi & molendi 2009 ) ; in particular , we will examine in detail the following six clusters : a2199 , a2597 , a1689 , a1656 , a2256 , a644 .",
    "these have been collected from the literature on the basis of the quality and detail of the x - ray data , keeping a balance between the cc and ncc classes .",

    "we understand these trends in the framework of two - stage cluster formation ( see   1 ) as follows .",
    "for example , low values of @xmath97 correspond to high values of @xmath73 ( see eq .  4 ) owing to low values of @xmath62 ( see eq .",

    "this behavior is highlighted in terms of @xmath252 ; as the icp density @xmath7 rises monotonically inward , @xmath2 will peak and then decline toward the center as @xmath45 decreases sharply toward a low central value @xmath83 .",
    "such an inward decline of @xmath2 to a low but finite central value @xmath253 links to a high density @xmath254 to constitute the _ cool core _ , a feature of the non - radiative sm equilibrium ( also present in simulations discussed by borgani et al .",
    "as expanded upon by clff09 , the sm does not include enhanced cooling , even less any related inflow ; it rather focuses the conditions for enhanced radiation and fast cooling to set in on the timescale @xmath255 gyr .",
    "this would lead to a cooling catastrophe ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; blanchard et al .",
    "1992 ) , that may be stabilized by icp condensing around and into a central massive galaxy to trigger accretion on the nuclear black hole .",
    "these conditions kindle up agn activities that drive rising bubbles or even outgoing blastwaves , feed back entropy , and distribute it widely into the icp ( see binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 2001 ; cavaliere et al .",

    "we have derived outer powerlaw slopes @xmath257 ( see table  1 ) , lower than the standard value @xmath71 corresponding to the standard concentration @xmath63 .",

    ", clff09 find that a _ steeper _ density slope @xmath260 is to apply in the outskirts .",
    "the high concentration of a1689 implies this to be an old structure with the bulk region dating back to a transition epoch as early as @xmath261 .",
    "in fact , the feature common to cc clusters like a2199 , a2597 , and a1689 is constituted by low values of @xmath257 and high values @xmath262 ( see table  1 ) , that follow from their being generally _ old _ structures with shallow outer potential wells .",
    "at the other extreme , the ncc clusters appear to be dynamically _ young _ structures from our determination of dm concentration and slope in the outer entropy profile .",
    "for example , in a1656 ( coma cluster ) our sm fit requires a _ high _ value @xmath263 , and relatedly ( see eqs .  3 and 4 ) a _ low _ concentration @xmath63 and young age @xmath264 . toward the center ,",

    "such features are exhibited , in a sequence of increasing complexity , by a1656 , a2256 and a644 . here",
    ", the sm elicits not only a high level , but also a _ pattern _ for the entropy deposited in the form of a floor extended out to @xmath89 .",
    "this we interpret in terms of the stallation radius attained by a powerful , outbound blast either triggered by a major head - on merger ( cf .",
    "simulations by schindler et al .",
    "2002 , vazza et al . 2009 ) or driven by a violent agn outburst ( see forman et al . 2005",
    "; cavaliere & lapi 2006 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ; puchwein et al .",
    "2008 ) , before being degraded into adiabatic sound waves of the kind caught in action by fabian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the perseus cluster . to reach @xmath266 kpc it takes a rather extreme merger delivering about @xmath267 erg and triggering a sedov blastwave that expands as @xmath268 with decreasing mach number ; alternatively",
    ", it takes an agn outburst of about @xmath269 erg continuously driving a blastwave to expand at constant mach number with @xmath270 , see lapi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and cavaliere et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for details . as discussed in   4.4 and 4.5 , in the ncc clusters a1656 and a2256 analyzed here such values of @xmath89 are accompanied by evidence of ongoing mergers , hallmarks of a recent cluster formation .",
    "this interpretation relates @xmath89 to the _ dating _ of the merger responsible for the energy / entropy input ; the good performance of the sm implies such a time to be intermediate between the blast transit time @xmath271 gyr ( see cavaliere & lapi 2006 ) , and the time @xmath272 gyr needed by radiative cooling to erode an entropy floor of about @xmath265 kev @xmath123 .",
    "such a timing also guarantees that an accurate description of the icp thermodynamic state for both cc and ncc clusters is provided by the sm based on the hydrostatic equilibrium expressed by eq .",
    "( 1 ) . to complete the issue , note that not only the equilibrium of the icp is somewhat faster to attain than the dm s ( see ricker & sarazin 2001 ; lapi et al . 2005 ) , but also that circularized data ( integrated over annuli , see snowden et al .",
    "2008 ) tend to effectively smooth out local , limited deviations from spherical hydrostatics and to better agree with equilibrium .",
    "how does the sm face the challenge of _ complexity _ posed by substructures as observed in a2256 and a644 ?",
    "interestingly , we still obtain good fits if we extrapolate the sm out to , or perhaps beyond its literal limits , toward conditions where @xmath2 varies on the scale @xmath89 , or differs around two locations ( cf . figs .",
    "8 - 11 ) ; these conditions highlight the capabilities of the sm as a mere fitting tool . by the same token ,",
    "the sm provides sharp snapshots of physical conditions even when these are spatially complex ( as for a644 ) , and strongly suggests that they may be traced back to two merger outcomes : a ` hot spot ' imprinted in a2256 to partially erase a previous cool state and to yield a nascent ncc ; or a ` cold drop ' imported into the hot medium of a644 that will offset cooling . focusing on the cold component ,",

    ", our values in column 7 systematically agree with literature evaluations ; the agreements of the related virial masses are commented upon in   4.3 , 4.4 , 4.5 .",
    "finally , column 8 visualizes the boundary values @xmath61 useful to introduce a discussion of the actual shock strengths related to the development of the outer halo and to preheating levels of the ( warm - hot ) igm ( see   3 ) .    to sum up , our analysis of several ncc and cc galaxy clusters has shown how effective is the tool constituted by our supermodel .",
    "on using a simple formalism and a fast algorithm , this leads to accurately fit in terms of a _ few _ physical parameters the _ many _ data points concerning _ diverse _ temperature and brightness shapes to constitute the library indexed by table 1 .",
    "whence we extract sharp information concerning the evolutionary stage and the thermal history of clusters ; in the inner regions these include the _ level _ ( @xmath83 ) , _ pattern _ ( @xmath89 ) and _ timing _ of the entropy injections into the icp , and in the outskirts the _ slope _ ( @xmath97 ) of the entropy deposited by accretion , simply related to the halo _ concentration _",
    "( @xmath26 ) and _ age _ ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "finally , the supermodel offers predictions as for the density and temperature profiles in the cluster outskirts out to the boundary @xmath51 facing the igm ; for example , within a surrounding supercluster enhanced igm preheating may be expected to weaken the accretion shocks and lower the tail of the brightness and temperature profiles .",
