    "single photons are considered as one of the most suitable carriers for quantum information .",
    "it is important to control the single - photon transport in quantum information processing .",
    "recently , controllable single - photon transport in 1d waveguide with linear and nonlinear dispersion relations has been extensively investigated both theoretically shen2005ol , lan , shen2007pra , roy2010prb , royb , fan2012prl , kocabas , shenjt , fanshen , paolo , busch , shit , zhengprl , zhengprl1,zhengprl2,liao , witthaut2010njp , liqiong , zhour , gongzr , liaojq , weilf1,cheng , wangzh , brad , yanwb , weilf , hart and experimentally@xcite . in a 1d waveguide , the photons",
    "are confined to propagating only forward or backward in 1d space . by coupling an emitter to the waveguide",
    ", the strong photon - emitter interaction can be obtained and the photon transport in the 1d space can be affected by the interaction .",
    "it is known that for a 1d waveguide coupled to a two - level emitter shen2005ol , lan , the injected single photon will be completely reflected in the resonance case due to the interference between the wave function of the input photon and the spontaneously emitted photon .",
    "the single - photon transport in a 1d waveguide coupled to a multi - level emitter witthaut2010njp , gongzr has also been studied .",
    "compared to a two - level system , the multi - level system provides more controllable parameters .",
    "for instance , when a 1d waveguide is coupled to a @xmath0-type emitter , a strong pulse was employed to drive one of the atomic transitions .",
    "since the single photon transport can be controlled by the extra pulse , the all - optical device can be achieved .",
    "however , most of the controls need strong pulse containing many photons or rely on other parameters .",
    "it is interesting to study the controllable single - photon transport by another photon without the classical field .    in this paper , we propose a scheme to study the control of single - photon transport in a 1d waveguide with nonlinear dispersion relation at the single - photon level . in our scheme ,",
    "the single - photon transport can be controlled by a cavity field .",
    "when the control cavity field is in the vacuum state , our scheme can be considered as a 1d waveguide coupled to a two - level system .",
    "therefore , the input single photon will be reflected in the resonance case .",
    "when the control cavity contains one photon , our scheme becomes a 1d waveguide coupled to a three - level system with cascade configuration .",
    "the full transmission of the input single photon can be obtained in the resonance case .",
    "it is necessary to note that the control of single - photon transport by another photon without classical field in 1d waveguide with linear dispersion relation has been studied in ref .",
    "we also study the single - photon transport controlled by the parameters of the control cavity , such as the coupling strength to the emitter , photon number and resonant frequency . by the way",
    ", the quantum control of single - photon transport in 1d waveguide with linear dispersion relation by cavity - emitter coupling strength has been studied in ref .",
    "our scheme does not contain inelastic scattering .",
    "our scheme can be considered as a 1d waveguide with nonlinear dispersion relation coupled to a v - type atom in the dressed - state representation .",
    "some outcomes can be understood better than in the bear - state representation .",
    "the schematic diagram of the considered system is shown in fig",
    "the 1d waveguide is composed by a coupled - cavity array with a very large number of single - mode cavities and one two - mode cavity .",
    "the cavity modes of the 1d coupled cavities are represented by the annihilation operators @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the label of site . here",
    "we take the site of the two - mode cavity @xmath3 . hence",
    ", one mode of the two - mode cavity , which is coupled to the nearest - neighbor single - mode cavities , is represented by the annihilation operators @xmath4 .",
    "we represent the other mode of the two - mode cavity by the annihilation operator @xmath5 . for simplicity , we assume that the cavity modes @xmath1 have the same resonant frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the cavity mode @xmath5has the resonant frequency @xmath7 .  a three - level system in cascade configuration is doped in the two - mode cavity .",
    "the three - level system can be a real atom or a manual atom - like object .",
    "it will be mentioned as an atom below .",
    "we represent atomic states @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with frequencies @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we choose the ground - state energy for reference and , hence , take @xmath11 zero .",
    "the level transitions between @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coupled to the modes @xmath4 and @xmath5 with strengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . in the rotating - wave approximation , the system hamiltonian has the form of@xmath18with@xmath19here we have taken @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 denotes the cavity photons , @xmath22 is the atomic free hamiltonian and @xmath23 describes the interaction of the atom with the two - mode cavity .",
    "the sum part of @xmath21 describes the hopping of the @xmath1 mode photons to the nearest - neighbor cavities with strength @xmath24 .",
    "here we have assumed that all the hopping strengths are equal . by introducing the fourier",
    "transform @xmath25 and taking the distances between two nearest - neighbor cavities unit , the term @xmath26 can be diagonalized as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the cavity number .",
    "this implies the nonlinear dispersion relation of the 1d coupled - cavity waveguide .",
    "we assume that , initially , a photon is injected into the waveguide from the left side , the atom is in its ground state @xmath8 , and that the two - mode cavitiy contains @xmath30 @xmath5-mode photons .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath30 can not be very large , i. e. @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "this because we have emploied the rotating - wave approximation in hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "the input single photon will transport along the waveguide and be scattered due to the atom - cavity interaction . obviously , when @xmath33 , the atom will absorb the injected photon , meanwhile making a transition from the level @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and then reemit a photon , meanwhile making a transition from the level @xmath34 to @xmath8 .",
    "in this case , the atomic level @xmath10 never participates in the dynamic process because the atomic transition from level @xmath9 to @xmath10 needs to absorb a @xmath5-mode photon .",
    "hence , our scheme is equal to a coupled - cavity waveguide coupled to a two - level system when @xmath33 .",
    "however , when @xmath35 , the transition @xmath36 participates in the dynamic process , revealing differen behaviors from the @xmath33 case due to the quantum interference between different atomic transitions .",
    "the arbitrary state governed by the hamiltonian can be written as@xmath37with @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 probability amplitudes .",
    "the state @xmath41 , denotes that the atom is in the state @xmath42 , and the two - mode cavity contains @xmath30 @xmath5-mode photons .",
    "the state @xmath43 denotes the 1d waveguide does not contain any @xmath1-mode photon . from the eigenequation @xmath44 , we can obtain a set of equations of the probability amplitudes .",
    "then by eliminating the probability amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we can obtain the equation of the probability amplitude @xmath38 , which reveals the single photon transport property , as@xmath45\\alpha _ { j}=-\\xi ( \\alpha _ { j+1}+\\alpha _ { j-1})\\text { , }   \\label{field}\\]]with @xmath46\\}}{[e-(\\omega _ { 2}+n\\omega _ { b})]\\{e-[\\omega _ { 3}+(n-1)\\omega _ { b}]\\}-g_{b}^{2}n}\\text{.}\\]]the effective potential @xmath47 resulting from the atom - cavity interaction located at site @xmath48 modifies the single - photon transport property .",
    "if the two - mode cavity does not contain @xmath5-mode photons , we find @xmath49 , in line with the outcome in ref .",
    "we consider the simple case that the atomic transition @xmath50 is driven resonantly by the input photon .",
    "the potential is derived as @xmath51 when @xmath33 . however ,",
    "if we inject a @xmath5-mode photon into the two - mode cavity initially , i.e. @xmath52 , the potential is obtained as @xmath53 .",
    "especially , when the @xmath5-mode photon resonantly drives the atomic transition , i.e. @xmath54 , the potential equals to zero .",
    "therefore , we can modify the effective potential between @xmath55 and @xmath3 by one @xmath5-mode photon .",
    "this implies that the single - photon transport can be controlled by only one @xmath5-mode photon .",
    "for the single - photon transport in the 1d waveguide , the spatial dependence of the amplitude @xmath38 can be expressed as@xmath56where @xmath57 is the reflection amplitude and @xmath58 is the transmission amplitude .",
    "the heaviside step function @xmath59 equals to @xmath60 when @xmath61 is larger than @xmath3 , while it equals to @xmath3 when @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath3 . from equation and , when @xmath62 , we can find @xmath63 , which corresponds to the dispersion relation derived above . and",
    "when @xmath48 , we can derive the expression of the reflection and transmission amplitudes as@xmath64\\sin k+g_{a}^{2}(\\delta _ { a}+\\delta _ { b})}\\text { , }   \\label{randt } \\\\ t & = & \\frac{2i\\xi \\lbrack \\delta _ { a}(\\delta _ { a}+\\delta _ { b})-g_{b}^{2}n]\\sin",
