    "it is well known that there is a large scatter in the heavy element content of galaxies .",
    "this is due to the fact that different galaxies evolve chemically at different rates .",
    "galactic winds with different efficiencies can also make a significant contribution to the scatter in metallicity in low - mass dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the oxygen abundance in the interstellar gas is usually used as a tracer of metallicity in late - type ( spiral and irregular ) galaxies .",
    "a question of great interest in the chemical evolution of galaxies is that of the maximum value of the observed oxygen abundance .",
    "is there such a value ? and is this maximum value equal to the maximum attainable value of the oxygen abundance in galaxies ?",
    "the latter is defined by the stellar oxygen yield , i.e. the mass of oxygen freshly synthesized and ejected by a generation of stars relative to the mass locked up in low - mass stars and compact remnants .",
    "it can be derived within the framework of chemical evolution models of galaxies @xcite . the closed - box model which neglects mass exchange between a galaxy and its environments",
    "gives the maximal upper bound to the metallicity of the gas for a given gas mass fraction @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the procedure is often inverted , i.e. the measured chemical compositions of galaxies are used to estimate empirically the oxygen yield ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is so because the theoretical value of the oxygen yield is not well known , due to uncertainties in both the oxygen production by stars of different masses and metallicities and the parameters of the initial mass function of stars , the relative birthrates of stars with different initial masses .",
    "thus the uncertainty in the stellar oxygen yield prevents an accurate determination of the maximum attainable value of the oxygen abundance in galaxies through chemical evolution models of galaxies .",
    "can we determine that maximum value by observations ?",
    "oxygen abundances in the most metal - rich spiral galaxies in the samples of @xcite ) have been estimated previously by @xcite .",
    "those authors found the maximum gas - phase oxygen abundance in the central regions of those spiral galaxies to be 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.75 , suggesting that this value may be an upper limit to the oxygen abundances in spiral galaxies .",
    "here we carry out a search for the maximum oxygen abundance using a considerably larger sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "the strategy of our search is based on the two following considerations .",
    "first , @xcite have found that , for irregular galaxies , the oxygen abundance correlates with the total galaxy mass , in the sense that the higher the total mass , the higher the heavy element content . since the galaxy mass is a poorly known quantity , the luminosity  metallicity ( l  z ) relation",
    "is often used instead of the mass  metallicity relation .",
    "@xcite have indeed found that spiral disk abundances correlate well with galaxy luminosities .",
    "this luminosity - metallicity correlation has been confirmed in many studies of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite and @xcite have established many years ago the presence of radial abundance gradients in the disks of spiral galaxies , with the maximum oxygen abundance occurring at their centers . taken together , these two facts suggest that the observed oxygen abundance should reach its maximal value at the centers of the most luminous galaxies .    in the following",

    "the excitation parameter p can be expressed as : p = r@xmath5/(r@xmath3+r@xmath5 ) .",
    "the plan of our study is as follows . in section 2",
    "we determine the central oxygen abundance for a large sample of nearby spiral galaxies and derive the maximum oxygen abundance .",
    "the value of the oxygen yield is estimated in section 3 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath84363 auroral line is not detected in the majority of hii regions in spiral galaxies . for a quarter of a century ,",
    "different versions of the one - dimensional empirical calibration , first proposed by @xcite , have been used for abundance determination in such hii regions . @xcite has found that the oxygen abundances so determined have a systematic error , depending on the excitation parameter defined above .",
    "recently , a relationship between the observed auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes , the ff relation , has been established @xcite .",
    "the ff relation allows one to estimate the flux in the [ oiii]@xmath84363 auroral line , and hence to apply the t@xmath9 method to determine abundances in hii regions where that line is not detected , and where only strong oxygen line intensities are seen .",
    "we have also derived a new model - independent @xmath10 ",
    "@xmath11 relation @xcite @xmath12 we have thus found a way to estimate the electron temperature in both in the o@xmath13 and in the o@xmath14 zones in high - metallicity hii regions where the [ oiii]@xmath84363 auroral line is not detected .",
    "next , we apply the method described above to derive new oxygen abundances in spiral galaxies .",
    "our aim is to search for a maximum value of the observed oxygen abundance in galaxies .",
    "we first define our observational sample .",
    "we use the compilation by @xcite of a large sample of published spectra of hii regions in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "recent measurements from @xcite have been added to that list .",
    "since the maximum value of the observed oxygen abundance is expected to occur at the centers of the most luminous galaxies , we first derive the radial distribution of the oxygen abundance in the disks of the four most luminous spiral galaxies in our sample : ngc  1068 with an absolute blue magnitude m@xmath15 = 22.18 , ngc  6384 with m@xmath15 = 22.22 , ngc  7331 with m@xmath15 = 22.20 , and ic  342 with m@xmath15 = 22.27 . the distances and luminosities of the galaxies",
    "are taken from @xcite .",
    "[ figure : bright ] shows the oxygen abundance as a function of galactocentric distance in the disks of the four most luminous spiral galaxies in our sample .",

    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ figure : bright ] shows that the central oxygen abundance in the most luminous spiral galaxies can be as large as 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.87 .",
    "are those galaxies indeed the most oxygen - rich ones as expected from the l  z correlation ?",
    "to clarify this point , we next derive the central oxygen abundances of all the spiral galaxies in our sample and examine their dependence on galaxian luminosity .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : lz ] shows the familiar l  z relation , where z denotes here the central oxygen abundance .",
    "the squares show the central ( o / h)@xmath17 abundances of the spiral galaxies in our sample . for the majority of galaxies ,",
    "all hii regions with available oxygen emission line measurements have been used in the abundance gradient analysis . for a few galaxies however , some hii regions have been omitted for the following reason .",
    "the @xmath18  o / h relation is double - valued , with two distincts parts usually known as the `` lower '' and `` upper '' branches .",
    "the ff relation is valid only for hii regions which are located in the upper branch , with 12+log(o / h ) higher than @xmath19 .",
    "thus , one has to know _ a priori _ on which of the two branches the hii region lies .",
    "given that disks of spiral galaxies show radial oxygen abundance gradients , in the sense that the oxygen abundance is higher in the central part of the disk and decreases with galactocentric distance , we first consider hii regions in the central part of disks and move outward until the radius @xmath20 , where the oxygen abundance decreases to 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.25 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath20 is somewhat uncertain due to the scatter in the oxygen abundance values at any fixed radius .",
    "it should be emphasized that a misuse of ff relation in the determination of the oxygen abundance in low - metallicity hii regions beyond @xmath20 may produce an artificial change of slope at @xmath20 in the abundance gradients @xcite .",
    "therefore , hii regions with galactocentric distances larger than @xmath20 , i.e. those with 12+log(o / h ) less than 8.25 were rejected .    the filled circles in fig .",
    "[ figure : lz ] show irregular galaxies from @xcite .",
    "our l  z diagram for irregular galaxies is in good agreement with the ones derived by other authors @xcite .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "[ figure : lz ] shows that the central oxygen abundances in galaxies with m@xmath15 @xmath2 20.25 are in the same range as those of galaxies with m@xmath15 @xmath2 22.25 ,",
    "i.e. the central oxygen abundances in luminous galaxies with m@xmath15 @xmath21 20.25 do not show an appeciable correlation with galaxy luminosity .",
    "this flattening of the l  z relation can be seen more clearly in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : lz ] which shows a blow - up of the high - luminosity end of the relation .",
    "the presence of an upper envelope in the l  z relation at 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.87 , is clearly seen . the flattening of the l  z relation at high luminosities has been noted before by @xcite .    what is the meaning of such a plateau",
    "? there are two known reasons for the existence of the l  z relation .",
    "first , it can be caused by a dependence of the efficiency of galactic winds to get rid of metals on the galaxy s luminosity : more luminous and massive galaxies are less efficient in losing heavy elements by galactic winds . in this case , the l  z relation represents the ability of a given galaxy to retain the products of its own chemical evolution rather than its ability to produce metals @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the galactic winds do not play a significant role in the chemical evolution of the largest spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second reason that has been invoked to explain the l  z relation , which we adopt , is that the astration level increases and the gas mass fraction decreases as the luminosity of a galaxy increases @xcite .",
    "the existence of a plateau at high luminosities in the l  z relation thus implies that , on average , the central parts of large luminous spiral galaxies have similar astration levels .",
    "another prominent feature of the l  z relation is the rather large scatter in oxygen abundances at a given luminosity , @xmath22log(o / h ) @xmath2 0.25 .",
    "part of this scatter may be due to uncertainties in the oxygen abundances .",
    "but another part is likely to be real .",
    "this scatter may be explained by fluctuations of the gas mass fraction @xmath23 among galaxies of a given luminosity .",
    "the simple model of chemical evolution of galaxies predicts that a decrease of @xmath23 by 0.1 results in an increase of the oxygen abundance by @xmath2 0.13 dex , in the range of @xmath23 from @xmath2 0.50 to @xmath2 0.05 .",
    "then , a scatter @xmath22log(o / h ) @xmath2 0.25 may be explained by fluctuations of the gas mass fraction as large as @xmath24 @xmath2 0.2 among galaxies of a given luminosity . the global gas mass fractions in the sample spiral galaxies",
    "have been estimated to be low , @xmath23 @xmath21 0.25 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the gas in the centers of the most metal - rich galaxies has been almost completely converted into stars .",
    "consequently , the observed oxygen abundance in the centers of those galaxies represents the maximum attainable value of the oxygen abundance .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the constant maximum value of the observed central oxygen abundance in the most oxygen - rich galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ figure : lz ] ) .    the maximum value of the gas - phase oxygen abundance in hii regions of spiral galaxies is thus 12+log(o / h )",
    "@xmath2 8.87 .",
    "some fraction of the oxygen is locked into dust grains @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the fraction of the dust - phase oxygen abundance in the orion nebula is about 0.08 dex ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "then , the maximum value of the gas+dust oxygen abundance in hii regions of spiral galaxies is 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.95 .",
    "the oxygen abundances we have derived here for luminous spiral galaxies are significantly lower than those obtained previously by a number of previous investigators @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the abundances in the papers quoted above have been derived using different versions of the early calibration .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the oxygen abundances so determined are significantly overestimated at the high - metallicity end .",
    "indeed , @xcite have themselves noted that their oxygen abundances may have been overestimated by as much as a factor of two .",
    "on the other hand , the oxygen abundances obtained here are not based on any calibration since they are derived via the t@xmath9 method coupled with the ff relation .",
    "the ff relation is purely empirical in the sense that it relates directly measured quantities , without any other assumption .",
    "the central oxygen abundances of two luminous spiral galaxies , m  101 ( m@xmath15 = 21.65 ) and m  51 ( m@xmath15 = 21.48 ) , have recently been determined from measurements of ( o / h)@xmath25 abundances in a number of hii regions .",
    "they have been found to be respectively 12+log(o / h)@xmath25 = 8.76 @xcite , and 12+log(o / h)@xmath25 = 8.72 @xcite .",
    "those data are in agreement with our l  z relation , but are in severe conflict with relations based on o / h abundances derived with the one - dimensional empirical calibrations .",
    "comparison with hii region photoionization models has led some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to question the applicability of the classic t@xmath9 method to the high - metallicity regime .",
    "we have suggested @xcite using the interstellar oxygen abundance in the solar vicinity , derived with very high precision from high - resolution observations of the weak interstellar oi@xmath81356 absorption line towards the stars , as a `` rosetta stone '' to check the reliability of the oxygen abundances derived in hii regions with the t@xmath9 method .",
    "the agreement between the value of the oxygen abundance at the solar galactocentric distance derived from the t@xmath9 method and that derived from the oi@xmath81356 interstellar absorption line towards the stars provides strong support for the applicability of the classic t@xmath9 method to solar - metallicity objects .",
    "we have also examined previously the reliability of oxygen abundances derived in high - metallicity hii regions with the t@xmath9 method by analyzing the radial distributions of oxygen abundances in the disks of spiral galaxies @xcite . according to @xcite , the derived ( o / h)@xmath25 value is very close to the real one as long as the metallicity is low .",
    "discrepancies appear for oxygen abundances 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.6 - 8.7 , and may become very large as metallicity increases ( fig .",
    "1a in * ? ? ?",
    "the derived ( o / h)@xmath25 values are smaller than the real ones , sometimes by enormous factors .",
    "if this is the case , then the radial distribution of ( o / h)@xmath25 abundances should show a bow - shaped curve with a maximum value of 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.7 at some galactocentric distance .",
    "however , the derived radial distributions of ( o / h)@xmath25 abundances in the disks of spiral galaxies do not show such an appreciable curvature , and the ( o / h)@xmath25 abundances increase more or less monotonically with decreasing galactocentric distance @xcite . thus , while our results do not rule out the possible existence of the stasiska s effect , they suggest that the great majority of hii regions in galaxies are in a metallicity range where this effect is not important .",
    "another factor that may affect our abundance determinations is temperature fluctuations inside hii regions @xcite .",
    "if they are important , our abundances would be underestimated .",
    "the abundances derived here thus depend on the ability of the classic t@xmath9 method to give correct abundances in the high - metallicity regime .",
    "they will be subject to revision if , when metal - rich hii regions are better understood , it is shown that the t@xmath9 method , because of temperature fluctuations , strong electron temperature gradients inside hii regions , or any other reason , results in incorrect abundances at high metallicities .",
    "the sun is one of the widely used reference objects in astrophysics .",
    "standard practice is to express the element content in a cosmic object via the corresponding value for the sun ,",
    "i.e. the composition of the sun is used as standard unit . for many years , the recommended solar oxygen abundance was 12+log(o / h)@xmath26 @xmath27 8.9 .",
    "this high abundance was obtained from a one - dimensional hydrostatic model of the solar atmosphere .",
    "recently the solar oxygen abundance has been significantly reduced as a result of a time - dependent , three - dimensional hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere . taking the average of recent determinations ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath26 = 8.70 in @xcite , 8.66 in @xcite , 8.59 in @xcite )",
    ", the solar abundance is now 12+log(o / h)@xmath26 = 8.65 .",
    "thus , the maximum value of the gas+dust oxygen abundance of hii regions in spiral galaxies is higher by a factor of @xmath2 2 than the solar value .",
    "the simple model of chemical evolution of galaxies predicts that the oxygen abundance of the interstellar matter of a galaxy is related to the gas mass fraction @xmath23 and the oxygen yield y@xmath28 by the following formula @xmath29 in a real situation , the oxygen abundance is also affected by the mass exchange between a galaxy and its environment .",
    "this mass exchange can alter the above relation and mimic a variation in the oxygen yield . in that case , the simple chemical evolution model is used to estimate the `` effective '' oxygen yield @xmath30 @xcite    as noted above , it is believed that galactic winds do not play a significant role in the chemical evolution of the largest spiral galaxies . for these , is the oxygen yield derived by using eq .",
    "( [ equation : y ] ) close to the true oxygen yield ?",
    "this may not be the case for two reasons .",
    "first , the simple model is based on the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "oxygen is produced and ejected into the interstellar medium by massive stars with lifetimes much shorter than the evolution time of spiral galaxies . from this point of view",
    ", the instantaneous recycling approximation is justified . however , the value of y@xmath28 depends not only on the amount of oxygen but also on the total mass of matter ejected in the interstellar medium ( see below ) . in other words",
    ", the instantaneous recycling approximation assumes that the next generation of star is formed when all stars from previous generations have finished their evolution .",
    "this never occurs in a real galaxy . as a consequence ,",
    "the simple model predicts slightly higher oxygen abundances than numerical models for the chemical evolution of galaxies with realistic star formation histories @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this difference is small and can be neglected in the case of oxygen .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the simple model predicts many more low - metallicity stars than are observed in the solar neighbourhood , the so called `` g  dwarf '' paradox .",
    "various versions of the infall model , in which an infall of gas onto the disk takes place for a long time , have been proposed to account for the observed metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "an infall model has also been applied to other spiral galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it is thus generally accepted that gas infall plays an important role in the chemical evolution of disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore , the application of the simple model to large spiral galaxies to estimate the true oxygen yields may appear unjustified .",
    "it is expected that the rate of gas infall onto the disk decreases exponentially with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the present - day location of a system in the @xmath23  o / h diagram is governed by its evolution in the recent past , but is independent of its evolution on long timescales .",
    "therefore , the fact that the present - day location of spiral galaxies is near the one predicted by the simple model is not in conflict with a picture in which an infall of gas onto the disk takes place during a long time ( the latter is necessary to satisfy the observed abundance distribution function and the age  metallicity relation in the solar neighbourhood ) since these observational data reflect the evolution of the system in the distant past .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the application of the simple model to large spiral galaxies , eq .",
    "( [ equation : y ] ) , provides a more or less reasonable estimate of the true oxygen yield y@xmath28 .",
    "certainly , to find an accurate value of the true oxygen yield y@xmath28 , an appropriate models of chemical evolution of galaxies should be computed .      from eq .",
    "( [ equation : y ] ) , it is clear that an accurate determination of the oxygen yield depends on accurate oxygen abundance and gas mass fraction measurements .",
    "our derived ( o / h)@xmath16 abundances are more accurate than the ( o / h)@xmath31 abundances used in previous studies . however , a precise estimate of the gas mass fraction is not a trivial task , and this for several reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the mass of the stellar component of a galaxy is usually estimated by converting the measured luminosity to mass via an adopted mass - to - luminosity ratio .",
    "the latter is strongly model - dependent , therefore it is difficult to get a reliable estimate of it for individual galaxies .",
    "it is widely accepted that the converting factor from the near - infrared luminosity is a robust quantity for deriving the stellar mass of a galaxy .",
    "this quantity shows a low dependence on the star formation history but depends strongly on the initial mass function ( for example , on the adopted lower stellar mass limit ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of molecular hydrogen can only be estimated by indirect methods .",
    "the commonly accepted method is the use of the co line flux and a conversion factor @xmath32 between the flux in the co line and the amount of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the conversion factor @xmath32 = n(h@xmath3)/i(co ) depends strongly on the physical properties of the interstellar medium which are known to vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the best - estimated values of x for a sample of well - studied nearby galaxies span the range from 0.6 to 10 @xmath33 10@xmath34 mol @xmath35 ( k km s@xmath36)@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "thus , the value of the oxygen yield derived from eq .",
    "( [ equation : y ] ) can be strongly affected by the uncertainty in the gas mass fraction determination .",
    "the use of the maximum value of the oxygen abundance derived here allows us to overcome the above problem in the following way .",
    "we compare the derived maximum value of the oxygen abundance in galaxies with oxygen abundances predicted by the simple models with different oxygen yields for @xmath23=0 .",
    "[ figure : cb ] shows the oxygen abundance as a function of the gas mass fraction predicted by the simple model with y@xmath28=0.0030 ( solid line ) and with y@xmath28=0.0035 ( dashed line ) .",
    "since the oxygen abundances are expressed in units of number of oxygen atoms relative to hydrogen , while z@xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ equation : y ] ) have units of mass fraction , we adopt the following conversion equation for oxygen @xcite @xmath37    the simple model breaks down as the gas mass fraction approaches zero because the term ln(1/@xmath23 ) blows up . therefore the oxygen abundance predicted by the simple model at @xmath23=0 should be estimated by extrapolation of the model predictions to @xmath23=0 .",
    "the extrapolations of the simple models for two values of the oxygen yield are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : cb ] by the dotted lines .",
    "the fact that the central oxygen abundances in galaxies are derived here , not as oxygen abundances of hii regions in the very central parts of galaxies , but also as extrapolations of linear fits , justifies the above method .",
    "the maximum value of the observed gas - phase oxygen abundance in hii regions of spiral galaxies is shown by the open square in fig .",

    "the maximum value of the gas+dust oxygen abundance is shown by the open circle .",

    "thus , we can conclude that the value of the oxygen yield is about 0.0035 , depending on the fraction of oxygen incorporated into dust grains .",

    "the similarity between the present oxygen abundances in the interstellar matter in the solar vicinity and that in the sun which was set up some 4.5 gyr ago , suggests that spiral galaxies have had a high oxygen abundance during most of their evolution .",
    "we therefore use estimates of the yields in the high - metallicity regime .",
    "we have compiled the yields at solar metallicity from several sources @xcite . following @xcite , we have used models a from @xcite for stars in the 11 - 25 m@xmath38 mass range , and models b for masses equal to 30 , 35 , and 40 m@xmath38 .",

    "it worth noting that the oxygen production is computed for single stars .",

    "inspection of the figure shows that that there is agreement between the m@xmath53 values from different authors , so that all the data can be approximated by the following expression @xmath54 the cumulative mass @xmath55 returned by a single stellar population is given by the following expression @xmath56    to compute @xmath39 and @xmath55 , we have to precise the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we first consider the @xcite imf @xmath57 the coefficient @xmath58 is defined by normalizing the imf over the whole mass interval @xmath59 where m@xmath60 and m@xmath49 are the lower and upper mass limits .",
    "these mass limits are not known and are in fact free parameters . for example , @xcite adopt m@xmath49 = 100m@xmath38 while @xcite choose m@xmath49 = 50m@xmath38 . sometimes , the fraction @xmath61 of the total stellar mass locked up in stars with masses above 1m@xmath38 is fixed , instead of m@xmath60 . @xcite",
    "have found that a `` good range '' for @xmath61 is between 0.3 and 0.4 .",
    "we next check whether there exist values of m@xmath60 and m@xmath49 so that y@xmath62 = y@xmath28 , where the model oxygen yield y@xmath62 is , by definition , the ratio of the mass of newly manufactured oxygen ejected by a single stellar population to the mass locked up in long - lived stars or remnants of that single stellar population @xmath63 since stars with masses less than 0.95 m@xmath38 have lifetimes longer than the hubble time @xcite , we set m@xmath64 = 0.95 m@xmath38 in eqs .",
    "( [ equation : qm],[equation : pi ] ) .",
    "then , by fixing y@xmath62 = 0.0035 and m@xmath49 , we can find m@xmath60 .",
    "the resulting dependence of m@xmath60 on m@xmath49 is shown in the upper panel of fig.[figure : muml35 ] .",
    "the triangles correspond to oxygen productions of stellar models with low stellar wind mass loss rates ( eq .  ( [ equation : nowind ] ) ) , while the squares correspond to oxygen productions of stellar models with high stellar wind mass loss rates ( eq .  ( [ equation : wind ] ) ) .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[figure : muml35 ] shows by the same symbols the fraction @xmath61 of the total stellar mass in stars with masses above 1m@xmath38 , for the same combinations of imf parameters and oxygen productions as in the upper panel .",
    "a number of multi - component power - law stellar imfs have been proposed as well .",
    "the one from @xcite is often used in the construction of chemical evolution models of galaxies .",
    "@xcite have found that the kroupa imf fits better several observed properties of the solar vicinity as compared to the salpeter imf .",
    "the three - component power - law imf of @xcite can be parameterized as follows @xmath65 the coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 are defined by normalizing the imf over the whole mass interval ( eq .  ( [ equation : normir ] ) ) , and by the condition @xmath68 for m@xmath50 = 0.5m@xmath38 .",
    "the dependence of m@xmath60 on m@xmath49 for the kroupa imf and for oxygen productions from models with high stellar wind mass loss rates ( eq .  ( [ equation : wind ] ) ) is shown by circles in the top panel of fig.[figure : muml35 ] .",
    "the bottom panel shows also by circles the fraction @xmath61 of the total stellar mass in stars with masses above 1m@xmath38 , for the same imf parameters and oxygen productions as in the top panel .",
    "the value y@xmath28 = 0.0035 can not be reproduced with a kroupa imf and oxygen productions from models with low stellar wind mass loss rates .    in summary",
    ", we have found that in the case of a salpeter imf , the observed yield , y@xmath28 = 0.0035 , can be satisfactorily reproduced by existing stellar evolution models with both low and high stellar wind mass loss rates .",
    "however , in the case of a kroupa imf , the observed yield can only be reproduced by stellar evolution models with high stellar wind mass loss rates .",
    "if the kroupa imf is more realistic than the salpeter imf , then our results suggest that stellar evolution models with low stellar wind mass loss rates predict too large oxygen yields . in the case of stellar models with high stellar wind mass loss rates ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 @xmath2 0.25 for a salpeter imf and @xmath61 @xmath2 0.40 for a kroupa imf .",
    "these values are close to the `` good range '' , 0.3 @xmath21 @xmath61 @xmath21 0.4 , found by @xcite .",
    "the above conclusion is at odds with the finding of @xcite that the oxygen yields in massive stars computed by @xcite without taking into account mass loss reproduce well abundance observations in the spiral galaxy m 101 .",
    "the origin of the divergences in @xcite conclusions and ours probably comes from the fact that those authors used an early higher value of the central oxygen abundance of m 101 , 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 9.2 , while recent measurements of ( o / h)@xmath25 abundances in a number of hii regions in m 101 have given a central oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h)@xmath25 = 8.76 @xcite .",
    "we search here for the maximum oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies .",
    "it is expected that this maximum value occurs at the centers of the most luminous galaxies .",
    "the luminosity  central metallicity diagram for spiral galaxies is constructed .",
    "the central oxygen abundance in a galaxy is derived from a linear least - square best fit to the abundances in individual hii regions at various galactocentric distances . the oxygen abundance in an hii region",
    "is derived using the t@xmath9 method , with the flux in the [ oiii]@xmath84363 auroral line determined from the ff relation when not available from observations .",
    "the electron temperature t@xmath3 is estimated from a newly derived t@xmath3 ",

    "we found that there exists a plateau in the luminosity  central metallicity diagram at high luminosities ( -22.3 @xmath0 m@xmath1 @xmath0 -20.3 ) .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the oxygen abundance in the centers of the most metal - rich luminous spiral galaxies reaches the maximum attainable value of oxygen abundance .",
    "the maximum value of the gas - phase oxygen abundance in hii regions of spiral galaxies is 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.87 . because some fraction of the oxygen ( about 0.08 dex ) is expected to be locked into dust grains , the maximum value of the true gas+dust oxygen abundance in hii regions of spiral galaxies is 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.95 .",
    "this value is a factor of @xmath2 2 higher than the recently estimated solar value .    based on our derived maximum value of the oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies ,",
    "we have estimated the oxygen yield .",
