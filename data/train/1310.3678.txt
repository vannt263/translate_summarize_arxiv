    "a slightly over a century ago ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hale ( 1908 ) ) discovered that sunspots are caused by strong magnetic fields in the sun .",
    "naturally , observing solar - like magnetic fields in other stars is extremely demanding , and their detection had to wait almost a century .",
    "still , stronger fields could be detected already much earlier .",
    "the first detections were done in magnetic , chemically peculiar , ap stars , which have strongest known magnetic fields of non - degenerate stars ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * babcock 1947a ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* babcock 1947b ) ) .",
    "recent years magnetic fields have been discovered in many different classes of stars , from pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guenther  1999 ) ) to neutron stars ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* morin  2008 ) ) to o - type ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* grunhut  2009 ) ) stars .    in this review",
    "the surface magnetism of cool g ",
    "m giants and supergiants is discussed .",
    "the main emphasis is on the observations of the surface features caused by magnetic fields and the measurement of the magnetic fields themselves , but also the origins of these fields are discussed .",
    "obtaining spatial information of the surface of stars , which appear as point sources in our telescopes , is challenging .",
    "the two main methods for achieving this are photometry and high resolution spectroscopy through doppler imaging techniques .",
    "photometry is the easiest and least observing time consuming way of carrying out starspot studies . in many active stars",
    "the starspots are so large that they cause brightness variations which can be few tens of percent from the mean light level , thus making them easily observable even from the ground ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chugainov 1966 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* montle & hall 1972 ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , solar - like spots are so small that they are lost in the noise , unless extremely precise observations can be obtained .",
    "currently the by - far best precision and time resolution observations are provided by the kepler satellite .",
    "doppler imaging ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * vogt  1987 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rice  1989 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* piskunov  1990 ) ) , which provides the best spatial resolution on the stellar surface , is a method that uses high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectroscopic observations at different rotational phases of the star .",
    "if the star has a non - uniform surface temperature , i.e. , has starspots , the spectral lines show small distortions from the normal gaussian shape .",
    "these distortions move in the line - profile when the position of the starspots on the surface changes , due to the change of line - of - sight velocity caused by the stellar rotation .",
    "surface maps , or doppler images , are constructed by tracking the movement of these distortions by combining all the observations from different rotational phases and typically comparing them with synthetic model line profiles .    during just the last years a breakthrough using long baseline infrared and optical interferometers has occurred .",
    "these facilities now routinely produce aperture synthesis images with milli - arcsecond angular resolution .",
    "a variety of targets have been imaged with astonishing result , e.g. , bulging stars rotating near their critical limit ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* monnier  2007 ) ) and compact dust disk around a massive young stellar object ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kraus  2010 ) ) .",
    "infrared interferometric imaging has produced amazing results of stellar surfaces and the time is drawing near when even temperature spots on cool stars can be imaged ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* roettenbacher  2013 ) ) , and naturally giant stars are the most fruitful starting point for this due to their large size .    studying the magnetic fields directly in stars can be done using zeeman splitting of the spectral lines .",
    "this method , which is the easiest one to interpret , requires high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio to accurately observe the spectral - line profile shapes ( see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* johns - krull & valenti 1996 ) ) .",
    "another way to study the magnetic fields themselves is to measure the polarisation of spectral lines ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* donati  1997 ) ) . in astronomy polarisation",
    "is usually described using the stokes vector [ i , q , u , v ] , where stokes i gives the total intensity spectrum , stokes v describes the circular polarisation and stokes q and u the linear polarisation .",
    "circular polarisation is mainly sensitive to the line - of - sight magnetic field and the linear one to the perpendicular field , therefore polarisation can be also used to measure the orientation of the field . if spectropolarimetric observations are obtained over the stellar rotation , similarly to what is done in doppler imaging , the surface magnetic field of the star can mapped using zeeman - doppler imaging technique ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* semel 1989 ) ) .",
    "cool giant stars are in general very slow rotators . many of their progenitors were slow rotators when in the main sequence and , even if they were not , the expanding envelope reduces the rotation rate significantly .",
    "this makes rotation driven , solar - like , dynamo action very improbable in these stars . still , there are some cases of giant stars being rapid rotators , and magnetically very active",

    "* berdyugina ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "the main types of active giants are discussed in the following .",
    "the most common type of active giants is the rs  cvn - type binaries , where a g  k giant or sub - giant is partnered with a less massive g  m main sequence star or a sub - giant .",
    "these typically tidally locked binaries are still detached systems , and their orbital ( and therefore often also rotation periods ) are commonly from few days to some tens of days .",
    "general properties and classification of rs  cvn - type binaries are discussed , e.g. , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hall ( 1976 ) ) and ( * ? ? ? * morgan & eggleton ( 1979 ) ) .",
    "the first star on which starspots were suggested to be the cause of the brightness variations , ar lac ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kron 1947 ) ) , is an rs  cvn - type binary . as is also the first cool star for which doppler imaging technique was applied , hr1099 , shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vogt & penrod 1983 ) ) .",
    "the doppler imaging of rs  cvn binaries often shows very large starspot , like the 12@xmath020 solar radii spot on hd  12545 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* strassmeier 1999 ) ) , and also very high spot latitudes , or even polar spots ( e.g. , in ku  peg by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* weber & strassmeier 2001 ) ) .",
    "for a handful of rs  cvn - type binaries magnetic field maps have been obtained , among these stars are hr  1099 and ii  peg which have maps from multiple epochs . and",

    "* donati ( 1999 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* donati  ( 2003 ) ) , and ( * ? ? ? * petit  ( 2004a ) ) have obtained both spot filling - factor maps and magnetic field maps of hr  1099 on five epochs spanning more than a decade in total .",
    "they discovered two distinct azimuthal field regions of opposite polarity around latitudes 30@xmath1 and 60@xmath1 .",
    "they also conclude that small - scale brightness and magnetic features undergo changes at time scales of 46 weeks , whereas the large - scale structures are stable over several years .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kochukhov  ( 2013 ) ) published magnetic field and temperature maps of ii  peg obtained from seven different epochs spanning in total 12 years .",
    "they observe significant field evolution on the time scale of their observations , additionally they did not find a clear correlation between magnetic and temperature features in their maps .",
    "fk  comae - type giants are a very small group of highly active g  k giants and subgiants ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* bopp & stencel 1981 ) ) .",
    "they show activity levels similar to rs  cvn binaries .",
    "what makes them special is that they are extremely rapidly rotating ( fk  com itself has @xmath2 around 160km / s ) , but still they are not part of a binary systems .",
    "the most commonly accepted explanation for the rapid rotation is that they are end products of a coalescence of w  uma - type contact binaries ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "the other two",
    "fk  comae stars with temperature maps are fk  com itself ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "magnetic field of hd  199178 has been mapped using zeeman doppler imaging by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* petit  ( 2004b ) ) .",
    "their maps from 2002 and 2003 reveal large regions of azimuthal field , and also changes in the exact field configuration with a time scale of about two weeks .",
    "for fk  com no zeeman doppler map exists , but its mean longitudinal magnetic field has been studied using low resolution spectra ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* korhonen  2009 ) ) .",
    "these observations indicate that the two high - latitude spots seen in the contemporaneous temperature map could have different polarity .",
    "some cool giant stars show enhanced li abundance , and some of these stars are also moderately rapid rotators , and thus magnetically active .",
    "* fekel & balachandran ( 1993 ) ) suggested that during the first dredge - up both angular momentum and li - rich material could be dredged - up from the stellar interior , creating a rapidly rotating li - rich giant .",
    "further analysis by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* charbonnel & balachandran ( 2000 ) ) of the li abundance and rotation in giants did not show clear correlation .",
    "whatever the cause for the rapid rotation is , it still enhances the dynamo operation in these stars and they become magnetically active .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ? * kvri  ( 2013 ) ) published temperature maps of two li - rich giants , dp  cvn and di  psc .",
    "for both stars low latitude spots with relatively small temperature contrasts ( 600 - 800 k below the unspotted surface temperature ) are recovered .",
    "in addition higher latitude spots are recovered , but they either have lower contrast ( dp  cvn ) or smaller extent ( di  psc ) .",
    "* lbre  ( 2009 ) ) also detected stokes v signal with temporal variations on li - rich giant hd  232862 , indicating a presence of magnetic field in this star .",
    "one would not expect to be able to detect magnetic fields on slowly rotating giant stars , because the slow rotation would not enable the dynamo to create strong enough magnetic fields .",
    "still , magnetic fields have been detected , and even mapped , in some slowly rotating giants .",
    "pollux is a k0 giant with rotation period of 100500 days .",
    "the star has been known for some time to be weakly active ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * strassmeier  1990a ) ) .",
    "a weak longitudinal magnetic field of -0.46@xmath30.04  g was detected in pollux by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aurire  ( 2009 ) ) , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "another similar case is arcturus where ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sennhauser & berdyugina ( 2011 ) ) detected a weak longitudinal magnetic field of 0.65@xmath30.26  g and 0.43@xmath30.16",
    "g from two spectra obtained at different times .",
    "the origin of the field detected in pollux and arcturus is most likely solar - like @xmath4-dynamo .",
    "not only weak fields are detected in slowly rotating giants .",
    "one puzzling case is ek  eri , which has rotation period of approximately 300 days ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* strassmeier  1990b ) ) , and still longitudinal magnetic field as strong as 100  g ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aurire  2008 ) ) .",
    "the modelling of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aurire  ( 2008 ) ) also reveal that the large scale magnetic field is most likely dominated by a poloidal component .",
    "they suggest that ek  eri is a descendant of a strongly magnetic ap star .",
    "similar suggestion has been made to explain the magnetic field measurements of @xmath5  cet .",
    "* tsvetkova  ( 2013 ) ) publish two zeeman doppler images of @xmath5  cet , obtained one year apart and showing very similar magnetic field configurations dominated by a dipole , and very little evolution between the maps .",
    "this all implies magnetic ap star origin of @xmath5  cet .",
    "magnetic fields have also been detected in more evolved m giants .",
    "ek  boo is a rapidly rotating ( for its class ) m5 giant .",
    "* konstantinova - antova  ( 2010 ) ) detected magnetic field which varied between -0.1  g and -8  g with time .",
    "in one of their observations they also detected complex structure in the stokes  v profile , which could indicate dynamo origin of the field . in their sample of nine m giants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* konstantinova - antova  ( 2010 ) ) also obtained marginal detection of magnetic field in another star , @xmath5  and .",
    "if cool giants are typically slow rotators , then m supergiants are even slower rotators .",
    "this makes solar - like dynamo operation in them virtually impossible . in addition , due to the very extended envelope of these stars , also a fossil magnetic field , remnant from a magnetic main sequence progenitor , would be extremely diluted and is not expected .",
    "m supergiants have gigantic convection cells , which have been predicted in simulations ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* gilliland & dupree 1996 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* haubois et al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "it has also been predicted that local dynamo could operate in the convection cells and create global magnetic field in supergiant stars ( ( * ? ? ? * dorch 2004 ) ) .",
    "the first measurement of the magnetic fields in m supergiants was done for betelgeuse by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aurire  ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "they detected a weak stokes v signal , and measured longitudinal field of about one gauss at six different epochs .",
    "there was also some evidence of the field strength increasing during the one month that the observations span .",
    "the results by ( * ? ? ? * petit  ( 2013 ) ) indicate that the magnetic elements may be concentrated in the sinking components of the convective flows .",
    "the sun exhibits well established 11-year spot cycle , and a 22-year magnetic cycle . the mt .",
    "wilson h&k project ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wilson 1978 ) ) has established similar behaviour of the over - all activity in many cool main sequence stars .",
    "unfortunately , magnetic cycles are much more demanding to detect observationally and only some indication have been seen in few stars .",
    "the best known example of a magnetic cycle in another star than our sun is the very short cycle , much shorter than the solar one , detected in the planet hosting f star @xmath6  boo ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* donati  2008 ) ) .",
    "wilson h&k survey provides a unique window to the cyclic activity of normal , non - active , stars .",

    "* baliunas  1998 ) ) . for the 175 studied ( sub)giants",
    "the fraction is 40% , and the giants also have a larger fraction of variable activity pattern ( not clearly cyclic ) than the dwarf stars have ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baliunas  1998 ) ) .    in active giants the activity cycles are easier to study due to the large brightness variations caused by the huge starspots these stars exhibit .",

    "they found that the active stars typically show multiple periodicities , and that the cycle period also changes with time .    in some of the active giants also",

    "flip - flops were originally discovered in fk  com by ( * ? ? ? * jetsu  ( 1993 ) ) . in this phenomenon",
    "the spot activity concentrates alternatingly on two permanent active longitudes , which are 180@xmath1 apart from each other .",
    "the active longitude remains more active for few years , and then the other active longitude takes over and is more active .",
