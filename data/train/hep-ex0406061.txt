    "the top quark was expected in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions as a partner of the b - quark in a su(2 ) doublet of the weak isospin , in the third family of quarks .",
    "searching for the top quark was the primary physics objective in run - i .",
    "the first published evidence appeared in a cdf  @xcite paper in 1994 , and its observation ( discovery ) was reported by cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite in the same issue of prl in 1995 .",
    "both experiments have finished their analyses of run - i data for some time now , and only a few new results on top quark are presented in this paper . a summary of the top quark s mass and the and single top production cross section measurements is presented . a closer look at the analysis techniques used and a perspective view on top quark physics after its first 7 years ( or so ) is the subject of this paper .    in anticipation of run - ii , in which the number of reconstructed events is expected to be at least 20x larger than in run - i , the question of whether all available results are consistent with the simplest hypothesis , adopted by both cdf and d0 experiments in run - i , that data contains just the events and the standard model backgrounds is re - visited .",
    "at fermilab tevatron energy , @xmath10 = 1.8 tev , the dominant production mechanism for top quarks is @xmath11 pair production by a quark - antiquark or gluon - gluon initial state via the strong interaction ; for top quark masses above m@xmath12 the @xmath13 fusion dominates . assuming the standard model decays , there are three classes of final states , all with two b - quarks jets : i ) _ di - leptons",
    ", when both w decays are leptonic , with 2 jets and missing transverse energy ( ) , @xmath14 for @xmath15 final states ; ii ) _",
    "lepton+jets _ , when one w decays leptonically and the other into quarks , with 4 jets and , @xmath16 for @xmath15 ; iii ) _ all - hadronic _",
    ", when both w s decay into quarks , with 6 jets and no , @xmath17 .",
    "the backgrounds to the possible @xmath18 signal coming from the @xmath19+jets process of qcd have been feared to be much larger than the top signal and must be addressed .",
    "the qcd multijet production background is even more important for all - hadronic final states , in which both w bosons decay into quarks .",
    "the two dominant electroweak processes leading to a single top quark production are : a ) s - channel w * production and its subsequent decay into t and b quark / antiquarks , leading to a final state with a w and two b - quark jets ; b ) t - channel w - gluon fusion process , leading to a final state with a w and two jets but only one of them being due to the b - quark .",
    "the techniques used in cdf and d0 are variations of simple event counting .",
    "both experiments follow identical steps : i ) identify events with the expected top signature ; ii ) calculate the expected sm backgrounds ; iii ) count events above the expected backgrounds ; iv ) apply corrections for the acceptance , reconstruction inefficiencies and other biases .",
    "this paper reports on measurements of the pair - production cross section and the single top production cross section .",
    "one should remember two facts : i ) it is _ assumed _ that the selected sample of events contains just the events and the sm background ; this is the simplest and the most natural hypothesis since the top quark is expected in the sm ; ii ) some of the acceptance corrections are strongly varying functions of the top quark mass , m@xmath20 , and , consequently , the value of the measured cross section depends on the value of m@xmath20 , which has to be determined independently .",
    "all mass measurement techniques used by cdf and d0 assume that each event in the selected sample contains a pair of massive objects of the same mass ( quarks ) which subsequently decay as predicted in the sm .",
    "information about the kinematics of the event is used in a variety of fitting techiniques . a one - to - one mapping between the observed leptons and jets and the fitted partons",
    "is assumed .",
    "again , there are two things to remember : i ) it is _ assumed _ that the selected sample of events contains just the events and the sm background ; ii ) the combinatorics of the jets - lepton(s ) combinations ( only one of many possible combinations is correct ) adds to the complexity of the problem .",
    "precision measurements of various electro - weak parameters , whose values depend on m@xmath20 indirectly ( via radiative corrections ) , are compared with the corresponding values predicted by the theoretical calculations in the consistency checks of the sm .",
    "data from lep - i , lep - ii , sld , cdf , d0 , @xmath21-scattering results and other precision experiments , including or excluding the direct measurements of the top quark mass , can be used to yield the most likely top quark mass , consistent with the predicted values of the measured electroweak observables .",
    "results are model dependent , as one has to assume a particular theory ( e.g. sm or minimal supersymmetric standard model ) to make such comparisons possible .",
    "an additional uncertainty comes from the unknown higgs boson mass , which also enters into calculations of the radiative corrections .",
    "the results of such global fits are summarized in section 8 , where the question of overall consistency of all electroweak measurements is examined within the framework of the standard model .",
    "all cdf and d0 searches impose stringent identification , selection and transverse energy ( ) cuts on leptons and jets to minimize the sm and misidentification backgrounds . except for di - lepton samples , in which backgrounds are expected to be small , various techniques of tagging b",
    "- quarks are employed to reduce backgrounds . ",
    "soft - lepton \" tagging is used by both cdf and d0 , and the secondary vertex tagging , which uses a silicon vertex detector ( svx ) , by cdf .",
    "d0 , not equipped with a svx , makes much greater use of various kinematic variables to reduce backgrounds .",
    "the largest sm background is the qcd w+jets production .",
    "both cdf and d0 use vecbos  @xcite calculations to estimate shapes of the background distributions due to this process . presently available samples of the top event candidates are small , and the top cross section and mass measurements are still dominated by the statistical errors .",
    "this will no longer be true in run - ii .",
    ".results of d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite direct top searches . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     perhaps even more importantly , the and single top events constitute background to any new physics . as a consequence of the large top mass ,",
    "the event selection cuts in top analyses are virtually identical to those applied in many analyses looking for physics beyond the sm ( supersymmetry , technicolor , et cetera ... ) .",
    "the measured cross section values depend on the top quark mass , whose value has been determined in cdf and d0 using various kinematical fitting techniques @xmath22 the assumption that events are just the events and the sm background .",
    "if the sample is not not exclusively due to the events and the sm background , the mass measurements may be incorrect . if an additional process were present , the number of observed events would not agree then with the mc predictions obtained with the measured value of m@xmath20 .",
    "it is thus imperative to compare various distributions of the reconstructed top quarks , and especially those of the -system , with the sm predictions .",
    "discrepancies could indicate new physics .",
    "both cdf and d0 made numerous comparisons .",
    "no significant disagreements were found , as perhaps should be expected given the still limited statistics .",
    "however , there exist a few hints that the simplest hypothesis ( that the top candidate events are just the events and sm background ) may not be entirely correct . with the luminosity of 2 fb@xmath0 per experiment they should be monitored carefully , as they may be offering us glimpses of new physics .",
    "i. cdf cross section seems a little high compared to the theoretical predictions ; it would be more consistent with the lower value of m@xmath20 ; the indirect measurements of m@xmath20 , based on the global checks of the sm _ excluding _ the direct m@xmath20 measurements , alo prefer lower m@xmath20 ( @xmath23 157 - 169 gev / c@xmath24 ) ii .",
    "there is an excess of w+2jet and w+3jet events ( 13 where 4.4@xmath25 are expected ) with double tagged jets ( tagged both with svx and slt ) in the tagged jet multiplicity distribution in the cdf .",
    "in addition , the kinematical properties of those events do nt agree well with the sm predictions  @xcite .",
    "there is a hint of an increase of the reconstructed top quark mass with the number of jets in an event .",
    "iv . two ( out of 9 ) cdf di - lepton events poorly fit the hypothesis and have unexpectedly large + @xmath26 .",
    "one such event exists in the d0 sample . v. the distributions of the mass , in both cdf and d0 , seem to have a few more events than expected in the high mass region .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of the system for the sample of 32 cdf tagged lepton+jets events , seems a little harder than expected , based on the monte carlo calculations .",
    "d0 data does not show any deviations from sm expectations .",
    "the rapidity distribution ( figure 6 ) of the system for the sample of 32 cdf tagged lepton+jets events has a strikingly different shape than that based on mc simulations .",
    "the rapidity variable probes directly the _ fitted _ longitudinal component of the neutrino momenta and , as such , is perhaps more sensitive than other variables to the correctness of the original hypothesis that the fitted events are the events .",
    "however , the d0 pseudorapidity plot ( figure 7 ) is in good agreement with expectations  @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank the conference organizers for their very warm hospitality and for making the epiphany 2003 an exceptionally well organized conference .",
    "it was an especially memorable experience for me ; i still vividly remember my times as a student , and later an assistant , at the institute of physics of jagiellonian university where the conference was held .",

    "giele , ( both cdf and d0 experiments used the vecbos w+3jets calculation , with an additional jet added in the fragmentation process simulated using herwig , rather than the more appropriate vecbos w+4jets calculation because of prohibitive amount of cpu required by the latter . )                       top mass and cross section results from cdf and d0 at the fermilab tevatron \" , k. sliwa , invited talk at 13th topical conference on hadron collider physics , tata institute of fundamental research , mumbai , india , january 14 - 20 , 1999 ; in proceedings , p 169 ; world scientific , 1999 ."
