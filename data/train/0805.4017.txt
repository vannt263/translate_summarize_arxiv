    "genomic dna is packaged into chromatin in eukaryotic cells .",
    "the building block of chromatin is the nucleosome , @xcite a 147 base pair ( bp ) dna segment wrapped in @xmath0 superhelical coils on the surface of a histone octamer .",
    "@xcite the unstructured tails of the histones are the targets of numerous covalent modifications @xcite and may influence how the ordered nucleosome array folds into higher order chromatin structures .",
    "chromatin can both block access to dna @xcite and juxtapose sites far apart on the linear sequence .",
    "@xcite    the regulation of gene expression by dna - bound factors can be partially understood from their binding energies and thermodynamics .",
    "nucleosomes formation energies vary by about 5 kcal / mol _ in vitro _ , @xcite comparable to the variation of dna - binding energies in other factors .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether the locations of nucleosomes _ in vivo _ can be predicted thermodynamically , either in isolation or in competition with other dna - binding factors . under this scenario ,",
    "the role of chromatin and its remodeling enzymes would be catalytic , modifying the rate of assembly but not the final disposition of factors on dna .",
    "the alternative is that chromatin remodeling within a regulatory unit actively positions nucleosomes to control access to the dna , in analogy with motor proteins .    it has not been possible to quantify by genetics where living cells fall between these extremes .",
    "recent computational approaches @xcite have used collections of dna positioning sequences isolated _ in vivo _ to train pattern matching tools that were then applied genome - wide",
    ". however , the training data may not be representative of direct histone - dna binding if other factors reposition nucleosomes _ in vivo _ by exclusion .",
    "furthermore , models based on alignments of nucleosome positioning sequences @xcite require a choice of background or reference sequence and it is known that nucleotide composition varies among functional categories of dna .",
    "* biophysical model of a nucleosome core particle . * for these reasons we developed a biophysical model for nucleosome formation that resolves the energy into the sum of two potentials modeling the core histone - dna attraction and the intra - dna bending energy . the first potential is assumed to be independent of the dna sequence since there are few direct contacts between the histone side chains and dna bases .",
    "@xcite for the dna bending , we constructed an empirical quadratic potential @xcite using a database of 101 non - homologous , non - histone protein - dna crystal structures .",
    "more specifically , we model dna base stacking energies by defining three displacements ( rise , shift , and slide ) and three rotation angles ( twist , roll and tilt ) for each dinucleotide ( fig . 1a ) . @xcite together the six degrees of freedom completely specify the spatial position of bp @xmath1 in the coordinate frame of bp @xmath2 ( supporting information ( si ) fig .",
    "geometric transformations based on these degrees of freedom can be applied recursively to reconstruct an arbitrary dna conformation in cartesian coordinates .",
    "conversely , the atomic coordinates in a crystal structure allow the inference of the displacements and rotations for each dinucleotide ( si methods ) .",
    "the elastic force constants in the quadratic dna bending energy are inferred from the protein - dna structural data by inverting a covariance matrix of deviations of dinucleotide geometric parameters from their average values .",
    "@xcite strongly bent dinucleotides ( with one or more geometric parameters further than 3 standard deviations from the mean ) are iteratively excluded from the data set ( si methods ) .",
    "our model does not use any higher order moments of empirical geometry distributions , which would lead to a non - quadratic elastic potential ; nor are there sufficient data to model more than successive base pairs .",
    "we assume that the histone - dna potential is at minimum along an ideal superhelix whose pitch and radius are taken from the nucleosome crystal structure , @xcite and varies quadratically when the dna deviates from the superhelix .",
    "this sequence - independent term represents the balance between the average attractive electrostatic ( and other ) interactions between the histones and the dna phosphate backbone , @xcite and steric exclusion between the proteins and dna .",
    "the sum of the bending and histone - dna potentials is minimized to yield the elastic energy and the dinucleotide geometries for each nucleosomal sequence ( see methods ) . because the total energy is quadratic ,",
    "energy minimization is equivalent to solving a system of linear equations and thus the algorithm can be applied on a genome - wide scale .",
    "there is no background in this model , but the results may depend on the choice of the protein - dna structural data set .",
    "since our bending energy is empirical and inferred from co - crystal structures , it lacks a physical energy scale . by comparison with the worm - like chain model our units can be converted to kcal / mol through multiplication by 0.26 ( si methods ) .",
    "we position multiple nucleosomes and proteins bound to dna using standard thermodynamics and enforce steric exclusion between bound entities in any given configuration ( si methods ) .",
    "our program dnabend can compute the sequence - specific energy of dna restrained to follow an arbitrary spatial curve .    * analysis of dna geometries from the nucleosome crystal structure .",
    "* one way to validate dnabend is to predict the dna conformation in the high - resolution ( 1.9  ) nucleosome crystal structure @xcite ( pdb code 1kx5 ) using only the dna sequence .",
    "the dnabend predictions are significantly correlated with the experimental geometries for twist , roll , tilt and slide ( @xmath3 ) , but are less successful for shift and rise ( si fig .",
    "10 ) , although the peak positions are generally correct .",
    "dnabend does not reproduce rapid shift oscillations in the region between bps 35 and 105 , and underestimates the magnitude of observed deviations in rise and slide .",
    "we under - predict slide since for certain key base pairs our training structures imply a much smaller mean value of slide ( _ e.g. _ 0.18    for ca steps ) than that observed in the nucleosome structures ( 0.91    for ca steps ) . changing just this one mean value",
    "gives more reasonable magnitudes of slide ( si fig .",
    "10 , black curve ) .",
    "et al . _ also observed that slide is large and positive in the nucleosome crystal structure , and makes a significant contribution to the superhelical trajectory .",
    "@xcite because nucleosomal dna is highly bent , different degrees of freedom are strongly coupled ( si fig .",
    "11a ) : for example , base pairs tend to tilt and shift simultaneously to avoid a steric clash .",
    "these couplings are much less pronounced in the non - histone protein - dna complexes used to derive the elastic energy model ( si fig .",
    "11b ) , but nonetheless appear prominently when the 1kx5 dna is positioned by dnabend ( si fig .",
    "analysis of available nucleosome crystal structures shows that the tight dna wrapping is facilitated by sharp dna kinks if flexible dinucleotides ( _ e.g. _ 5-ca / tg-3 or 5-ta-3 ) are introduced into the region where the minor groove faces the histone surface . for other sequences and other structural regions the bending",
    "is distributed over several dinucleotides .",
    "@xcite we substituted all possible dinucleotides into the 1kx5 atomic structure ( keeping dna conformation fixed ) , and computed the elastic energy for each sequence variant .",
    "the most sequence specific regions are those where the minor groove faces the histone octamer ( si fig .",
    "the specificity is especially dramatic if dna is kinked ( _ e.g. _ at positions 109 , 121 and 131 ; si fig .",
    "@xcite although these positions are occupied by ca / tg dinucleotides in the crystal structure , the model assigns the lowest energy to ta dinucleotides , consistent with the periodic ta signal previously observed in good nucleosome positioning sequences @xcite ( si fig .",
    ".    * comparison with _ in vitro _ measurements .",
    "* dnabend accurately predicts experimental free energies of nucleosome formation @xcite ( fig .",
    "2a , si fig .",
    "in contrast , the alignment model of segal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite trained on yeast nucleosomal sequences has little predictive power for the sequences in this set , most of which were chemically synthesized .",
    "dnabend also correctly ranks sequences selected _ in vitro _ for their ability to form stable nucleosomes , or to be occupied by nucleosomes _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite because the alignment model is constructed using the latter set it assigns anomalously low ( more favorable ) energies to some of the sequences from it , and higher ( less favorable ) energies to the artificial sequences known from experiment to have excellent binding affinities .",
    "@xcite finally , dnabend correctly ranks mouse genome sequences selected _ in vitro _ on the basis of their high or low binding affinity @xcite ( @xmath4 ) , whereas the alignment model has less resolution ( @xmath5 ) , though on average it does assign better scores to the high affinity set ( si fig .",
    "12b ) .    a further test of how dnabend actually positions nucleosomes on dna can be provided by a collection of sequences where _ in vitro _",
    "positions are known with 1 - 2 bp accuracy .",
    "we have determined nucleosome positions on synthetic high - affinity sequences 601 , 603 , and 605 @xcite using hydroxyl radical footprinting ( si figs .",
    "13 and 14 ) , and obtained 3 more sequences from the literature .",
    "@xcite the measured position is always within 1 - 2 bp of a local minimum in our energy , and that energy minimum in 5 out of 6 cases is within 0.5 - 1.0 kcal / mol of the global energy minimum ( si fig .",
    "15 ; note that the total range of sequence - dependent binding energies is @xmath6 kcal / mol ) .",
    "we also asked if dnabend could be used to design dna sequences with high and low binding affinities for the histone octamer .",
    "free energies of computationally designed sequences were measured _ in vitro _ using salt gradient dialysis @xcite ( si table 1 , si methods ) .",
    "the free energy of the designed best sequence was lower than the free energy of the designed worst sequence , although only by 1.6 kcal / mol , which is less than the experimentally known range of free energies ( si table 1 , si fig .",
    "these results underscore both the ranking power and the limitations of our current dna mechanics model .    * periodic dinucleotide distributions in high and low energy sequences .",
    "* dnabend - selected nucleosome sequences exhibit periodic dinucleotide patterns that are consistent with those determined experimentally : @xcite for example , with lowest energy sequences , 5-aa / tt-3 and 5-ta-3 dinucleotide frequencies are highest in the negative roll regions ( where the minor groove faces inward ) , while 5-gc-3 frequencies are shifted by @xmath6 bp ( si fig .",
    "surprisingly , the distributions of at and aa / tt , ta dinucleotides are in phase , despite a very low flexibility of the former ( si fig . 8b ) .",
    "it is possible that at steps are used to flank a more flexible kinked dinucleotide .",
    "we estimate the energy difference between the best and the worst 147 bp nucleosome forming sequences to be 15.2 kcal / mol , with the energies of 95% of genomic sequences separated by",
    "less than 6.4 kcal / mol ( si methods ) .",
    "this is larger than the experimental range ( si fig .",
    "12a ) because nucleosomes can not be forced in experiments to occupy the worst - possible location on a dna , but instead tend to find the most favorable locations with respect to the 10 bp helical twist .",
    "* prediction of nucleosome positions in the yeast genome .",
    "* we use nucleosome energies ( computed using the 147 bp superhelix ) and the binding energies of other regulatory factors to construct a thermodynamic model in which nucleosomes form while competing with other proteins for access to genomic sequence .",
    "a typical configuration thus contains multiple dna - bound molecules of several types and explicitly respects steric exclusion .",
    "we take all such configurations into account using dynamic programming methods @xcite that enable us to compute a boltzmann - weighted statistical sum and thus the probability @xmath7 for each factor to bind dna starting at every possible position along the genome ( fig .",
    "1b , si methods ) .",
    "@xcite we also compute the occupancy of each genomic bp , defined as its probability to be covered by any protein of a given type ( fig .",
    "there are two adjustable parameters for each dna - binding factor : the temperature , which determines how many factors are bound with high probability , and the free protein concentration , which determines the average occupancy . with our choice of parameters ( which have not been optimized , rather , were fixed to allow for comparison with previous studies - si methods ) , the average nucleosome occupancy is 0.797 , and stable , non - overlapping nucleosomes ( with @xmath8 ) cover 16.3% of the yeast genome .",
    "* bioinformatic models based on alignments of nucleosome positioning sequences .",
    "* several existing analyses of nucleosome positions are based on alignment models , and these in turn explicitly @xcite or implicitly @xcite include a background model .",
    "we examined the sensitivity of one alignment - based approach to the choice of background by implementing it in two different ways : alignment model i is identical to segal et al .",
    "@xcite and uses genomic background for one strand and uniform background for the other , while alignment model ii employs genomic background for both strands ( si methods ) . comparing two models allows us to separate more robust predictions from those that depend strongly on the implementation details . although the alignment models correlate well with each other ( @xmath9 ) , we find a small _ negative _ correlation between dnabend - predicted occupancies and energies and those from the alignment model i ( si fig .",
    "dnabend energies are strongly correlated if two nucleosomes are separated by a multiple of 10 bp , and anti - correlated if the nucleosomes are separated by a multiple of 5 bp , which puts the helical twist out of phase ( si fig .",
    "log scores predicted by the alignment model exhibit weaker oscillations ( si fig .",
    "17d ) , probably due to ambiguities in aligning the training sequences .    because all three models make somewhat different predictions of average nucleosome occupancies in broad genomic regions ( si fig .",
    "19 ) , additional experimental data are required to establish which model is the most accurate .",
    "in contrast , all models predict that the distribution of center - to - center distances between proximal stable nucleosomes ( with @xmath10 ) exhibits strong periodic oscillations ( si fig .",
    "20 ) . however , similar oscillations occur in a non - specific model where we first create a regular nucleosomal array and then randomly label a given fraction of nucleosomes as stable ( data not shown ) . because steric exclusion is respected by every model , nucleosomes form regular arrays ( si figs .",
    "17a , b ) which help induce the observed periodicity in the positions of stable nucleosomes .    *",
    "nucleosome depletion upstream of the orfs . * microarray - based maps of _ in vivo _ nucleosome positions show striking depletion of nucleosomes from the promoter regions ( fig .",
    "@xcite we find that this depletion is difficult to explain using nucleosome models alone .",
    "however , the nucleosome - free region upstream of the open reading frames ( orfs ) becomes much more pronounced when tata box - binding proteins ( tbps ) and other factors bind their cognate sites ( fig .",
    "3a , si fig .",
    "displaced nucleosomes are re - arranged in regular arrays on both sides of factor - occluded sites , @xcite creating the characteristic oscillatory structure around the nucleosome - free region which includes the occupancy peak over the translation start observed in both regular @xcite and h2a.z @xcite nucleosomes ( fig .",
    "3a and si fig .",
    "similar oscillations occur when non - specific nucleosomes compete with tbp ( si fig .",
    "21 ) , making intrinsic nucleosome sequence preferences hard to disentangle from the larger phasing effects in this data set .",
    "* nucleosome occupancy of tata boxes . * nonetheless , nucleosome stabilities can play a crucial role in gene activation : for example , dnabend predicts that both tata boxes in the promoter of the yeast _ mel1 _ ( @xmath11-galactosidase ) gene are occupied by a stable nucleosome , in agreement with the extremely low level of background gene expression observed in _ mel1 _",
    "promoter - based reporter plasmids @xcite ( fig .",
    "in contrast , the tata elements of the _ cyc1 _ promoter were shown to be intrinsically accessible _ in vivo _ , @xcite resulting in high background expression levels .",
    "consistent with these findings , we predict that one of the _ cyc1 _ tata boxes has intrinsically low nucleosome occupancy , and moreover that the nucleosome is easily displaced in competition with tbp ( fig .",
    "it has been suggested that tata box - containing genes may be repressed through steric exclusion of tbp by a nucleosome placed over the tata box .",
    "@xcite in agreement with this hypothesis , in the absence of other factors dnabend predicts slightly higher nucleosome occupancy over tata boxes ( fig .",
    "stress - induced genes are tata - rich and may be nucleosome - repressed under non - stress conditions .",
    "@xcite thus , this prediction of dnabend can be tested experimentally by measuring nucleosome occupancy over tata boxes of stress - induced genes in non - inducing conditions , genome - wide ( to ensure adequate statistics which were not provided by the data sets available to us , @xcite although it was found in a very recent genome - wide study of nucleosome occupancy in yeast that promoters of stress - induced genes tend to be covered by nucleosomes when cells are grown in ypd media , whereas the transcription start site for the typical gene was nucleosome - free @xcite ) .    * nucleosome - induced tf cooperativity and nucleosome depletion over tf binding sites . *",
    "it has been known from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that some near - consensus dna sequences are not occupied by their cognate transcription factors ( tfs ) , while poorer sites may be occupied .",
    "@xcite thus it is natural to ask whether histone binding preferences can help distinguish functional and non - functional tf binding sites .",
    "_ found that nucleosome occupancy was intrinsically smaller at functional sites @xcite ( si fig .",
    "24a ) , while dnabend predicts the opposite ( fig . 4a , upper panel ) ( but",
    "see contrary low resolution data from liu _",
    "however , if tfs are allowed to compete with nucleosomes at all sites , the nucleosomes become preferentially depleted ( and the tf occupancy becomes higher ) at the functional sites ( fig .",
    "4a , lower panel ) .",
    "this depletion is not due to the slightly more favorable binding energies of the functional sites ( si fig .",
    "25a ) , because it is reversed when their positions are randomized within intergenic regions ( si fig .",
    "furthermore , dnabend - predicted nucleosomes are not depleted over functional sites simply because they are less stable - fig .",
    "4a showed the opposite .",
    "in fact , functional sites tend to occur just upstream of the orfs ( si fig .",
    "25b ) , where dnabend - predicted nucleosomes exhibit enhanced stability ( si fig . 23 ) .",
    "the only remaining possibility is that the depletion of dnabend - predicted nucleosomes is caused by the spatial clustering of functional binding sites ( fig .",
    "4b , si fig .",
    "25c ) . in this scenario several dna - binding proteins",
    "cooperate to evict the nucleosome and thus enhance their own binding , in a phenomenon known as the nucleosome - induced cooperativity ( fig .",
    "4c ) . @xcite the cooperativity does not depend on direct interactions between tfs and requires only that two or more tf sites occur within a 147 bp nucleosomal footprint ( fig .",
    "4d ) . a model in which tfs compete with nucleosomes for their cognate sites provides the best explanation for the strong nucleosome depletion over functional sites observed in microarray experiments @xcite ( fig .",
    "although it is not yet conventional to do so , @xcite it would be trivial to reward clustering within 147 bp in codes that predict regulatory sites .    * predictions of experimentally mapped nucleosome positions .",
    "* we used a set of 110 nucleosome positions reported in the literature for 13 genomic loci to see how well dnabend predictions match _ in vivo _ chromatin structure ( fig .",

    "26a - n ) .",
    "the predictive power of nucleosome models improves considerably when sequence - specific factors are included ( fig .",
    "5 ) , though not in genome - wide sets ( si fig . 27 ) ; this result may be due to the lack of accurate genome - wide knowledge of tf binding sites and energies .",
    "for example , at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and recombination enhancer loci , nucleosomes are positioned in regular arrays whose boundaries are determined by the origin recognition complex , abf1 , rap1 , and mcm1/mat@xmath14 bound to their cognate sites ( si figs .",
    "26f - h ) . both intrinsic sequence preferences and boundaries created by other factors contribute to positioning nucleosomes : on one hand , at the _ gal1 - 10 _ locus a nucleosome covering a cluster of gal4 sites is evicted , making @xmath15 bp of promoter sequence accessible to tbp and other factors ( si fig .",
    "26a ) , as observed _ in vivo_. @xcite on the other hand , gcn4 and abf1 sites at the _",

    "we have developed a dna mechanics model capable of accurately predicting _ in vitro _",
    "free energies of nucleosome formation , optimal base pairs in the minor and major grooves of nucleosomal dna , and dna geometries specific to each base step .",
    "we only get an agreement with the available genome scale data sets @xcite for nucleosome depletion from the tata box and functional tf binding sites when we include competition with the relevant factors . in the absence of dna - binding factors dnabend predicts a weak enhancement of nucleosome occupancy over their sites and thus agrees with the conjecture , not yet demonstrated on a genome - wide scale , that nucleosomes provide a default repression .",
    "@xcite the two alignment models we examined do not support this conjecture ; it is conceivable that they have implicitly captured a hybrid signal from both nucleosomes and dna - bound factors .",
    "the highest quality data on generic nucleosome occupancy come from the specific loci summarized in fig .",
    "5 . there is a relatively weak signal from all models in the absence of other factors , originating from a few correct predictions at short distances .",
    "because dnabend predicts correct binding energies , the weak signal suggests that nucleosomes positioned by thermodynamics on bare dna have relatively weak correlation with _ in vivo _",

    "@xcite    similarly to the basepair rotation matrices , the mid - step triads are also constructed recursively : @xmath47 where    @xmath48    thus having a complete set of local geometric parameters @xmath49 is equivalent to knowing the global dna conformation : first , the recursive relation ( [ ri ] ) is employed to determine the orientations of all basepair coordinate frames ( except for the first one which has to be fixed in space independently and thus provides the overall orientation and position of the dna molecule ) .",
    "second , equation ( [ ri : mst ] ) is used to construct the mst frames , which are then employed to transform all local displacements @xmath35 into the global frame . finally , all displacement vectors are added up vectorially to determine the origins of the basepair coordinate frames . if necessary , the basepair frames can then be used to reconstruct the positions of all dna basepair atoms ( using an idealized representation which neglects flexibility of bases in a basepair ) . note that knowing a basepair coordinate frame is in general insufficient for predicting the positions of the phosphate backbone and sugar ring atoms because of their additional degrees of freedom",

    "@xcite    while the helical twist serves to rotate the consecutive dna basepairs with respect to one another , introducing non - zero roll and tilt angles imposes curvature onto the dna conformation . indeed ,",
    "if both roll and tilt are negligible @xmath37 is simply a rotation through @xmath51 around the z - axis ( which coincides with the helical axis in this case ) , and @xmath52 is a rotation through @xmath53 around the same axis . the action of roll and tilt can be seen more clearly by considering the curvature vector , defined as the difference between the tangent vectors for two consecutive basepairs : @xmath54 .",
    "the expression for curvature is simplified in the limit of small roll and tilt : since the magnitude of roll ( @xmath55 ) and tilt ( @xmath56 ) are typically much smaller than the helical twist per basepair ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 can be expanded to @xmath59 :    @xmath60    because we are primarily interested in the magnitude of the curvature vector , we can compute it in the local frame of basepair @xmath2 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the z - axis unit vector . using equation ( [ ti_linear ] )",

    "fitting an ideal superhelix to the high - resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle @xcite reveals that @xmath74    in order to transform the slowly rotating frenet basis vectors into the helically twisted local frames associated with dna basepairs , we impose an additional helical rotation around the tangent vector @xmath75 : @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the cumulative helical twist , @xmath78 is the average helical twist from the structure , and the rotation specified by equations ( [ nb : rot ] ) is performed in the @xmath79 basis .",
    "similarly , the mst frames are located at @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , and are rotated through @xmath82 to bring them into register with the helical twist .",
    "a superhelix described by equation ( [ ideal : t ] ) has constant curvature which is manifested by the constant difference between the consecutive tangent vectors : @xmath83 .",
    "this allows us to determine the length of the roll - tilt vector : @xmath84 ( which also gives the maximum value of roll and tilt ) .",
    "in this idealized picture , roll and tilt can be assumed to make equal contributions to the curvature . indeed , reconstruction of the local geometric parameters @xmath85 from the full set of helically twisted frenet frames results in @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88     and @xmath89 is the initial phase determined by the location of the first basepair .",

    "this problem is partially alleviated however by removing dinucleotides from the data set if one or more of their geometric parameters are further than 3 standard deviations away from the mean .",

    "applying @xmath101 to the local degrees of freedom leaves the angles ( twist , roll , and tilt ) invariant , but transforms the local displacements ( shift , slide , and rise ) into the global frame . to keep the elastic energy invariant , the force constants have to be transformed as well : @xmath102 .",

    "<S> in eukaryotic genomes , nucleosomes function to compact dna and to regulate access to it both by simple physical occlusion and by providing the substrate for numerous covalent epigenetic tags . while nucleosome positions _ in vitro _ are determined by sequence alone , _ in vivo _ competition with other dna - binding factors and action of chromatin remodeling enzymes play a role that needs to be quantified . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a biophysical model for the sequence dependence of dna bending energies , and validated it against a collection of _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> free energies of nucleosome formation and a nucleosome crystal structure ; we also successfully designed both strong and poor histone binding sequences _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio_. for _ in vivo _ data from _ s.cerevisiae_ , the strongest positioning signal came from the competition with other factors . </S>",
    "<S> based on sequence alone , our model predicts that functional transcription factor binding sites have a tendency to be covered by nucleosomes , but are uncovered _ in vivo _ because functional sites cluster within a single nucleosome footprint , making transcription factors bind cooperatively . </S>",
    "<S> similarly a weak enhancement of nucleosome binding in the tata region for naked dna becomes a strong depletion when the tata - binding protein is included , in quantitative agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> predictions at specific loci were also greatly enhanced by including competing factors . </S>",
    "<S> our physically grounded model distinguishes multiple ways in which genomic sequence can influence nucleosome positions and thus provides an alternative explanation for several important experimental findings .    </S>",
