    "the motion of a particle in temporally and spatially periodic potential has attracted renewed attention as a model of molecular motors @xcite . in order to make it a motor , that generates unidirectional motion out of periodic motion ,",
    "the potential has to be a `` ratchet '' , _",
    "i.e. _ its reflection symmetry in both spatial and temporal direction has to be broken , a fact generally known as a curie s theorem . traditionally , the friction has supplied the source of temporal symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "there are several recent works @xcite in which the frictionless `` inertial '' regime is studied where the time - asymmetric perturbation is the driving force of the unidirectional motion . through these studies ,",
    "it has become evident that the characeristics of the phase space plays a dicisive role .",
    "the exploration of the full phase space of a dynamical system , however , requires considerable computational resources .",
    "this naturally leads to models of ratchet dynamics in which the differential equation governing the time evolution is reducible to the discrete difference equations , namely the _ map _",
    "one would then like to have a model of a system with ratchet dynamics , which is free from _ ad hoc _ assumptions and parameters that tend to obscure the underlying simple physics .    in this article , we propose a simple model of a particle motion under temporally and spatially periodic potential whose key feature is in that the obtained descrete map is a natural extention of the chirikov - taylor map , also known as the standard map @xcite whose dynamical properties have been thouroughly analyzed .",
    "the unidirectional motion of the system is understood in the context of the deterministic diffusion found in the standard map .",
    "also , as a practical benefit of the discrete evolution of the map dynamics , the computational burden is substantially reduced , and it becomes possible to study , for the first time , the transportation properties of a system in a broad region in the controlling parameter space .",
    "a very intricate dependence of the unidirectional motion on the controlling parameter is revealed though a numerical investigation .",
    "we consider the motion of a classical particle described by a time - periodic hamiltonian with instantaneous potential action , or @xmath0-function kick , which has space periodic part and alternating - current type driving motion ; @xmath1 \\delta ( t - nt\\ { 1+\\varepsilon s_n\\ } ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for now , the trapping potential @xmath2 is set to be symmetric and given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the parity of the iteration number @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of the system is described by @xmath6 \\delta ( t - nt\\ { 1+\\varepsilon s_n\\ } ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can integrate the motion in between the @xmath0-function kicks and obtain the map which describe the evolution of position @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 at discrete time @xmath9 ; @xmath10 this set of equations can be regarded as a three - parameter extension of the standard map @xcite . the parameter @xmath11 , which is present in original standard map is the strength of the periodic potential that traps the particles in each periodic location .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the amplitude of alternating swing motion , and @xmath13 is the measure of its time asymmetry . as with the case of the standard map",
    ", the dynamical properties of the system is studied through the analysis of phase space @xcite .",
    "the transport property of standard map , @xmath12 = @xmath13 = 0 , is characterized in terms of phase space average of functions of position and momentum @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that the direct averages @xmath16 and @xmath17 are zeroas a direct result of the fact that the standard map is both time - reversal and space - reflectional symmetric",
    ". however the mean square @xmath18 can be non zero when one has the chaotic motion unbounded by kam tori in @xmath15-direction .",
    "this happens with sufficiently large value of @xmath11 .",
    "one then has deterministic diffusion through chaotic motion which is characterized by the random - walk behavior , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 . in the extended standard map ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] )",
    ", a unidirectional motion can be realized if one has by the non - zero value for the @xmath17 itself in the diffusive motion .",
    "the reflection symmetries play an essential role in the existence ( or non - existence ) of the unidirectional motion @xcite .",
    "one can rewrite ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) as @xmath22 these become identical in form to ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) themselves in case of @xmath12 = 0 .",
    "therefore , in this case , one has @xmath23 which means that there can not be any directed transport .",
    "we now define @xmath24 and @xmath25 , obtain a reverse map @xmath26 therefore , if one sets @xmath13 = 0 , the map for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are identical , and one has @xmath29 therefore , one needs both @xmath30 and @xmath31 to have directed motion .",
    "it is important to note that the map ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) in fact atcs differently for odd and ven @xmath5 because of the existence of @xmath32 term .",
    "it is advantageous to consider the phase spaces for odd @xmath5 and even @xmath5 separately . the reflection symmetry between ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7])-([eq8 ] )",
