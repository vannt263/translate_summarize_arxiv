    "noncommutative ( nc ) gauge theories have found many applications ranging from solid state physics to particle physics and also to quantum gravity since the noncommutativity in space  time induces naturally a quantum structure .",
    "one of the main tool to study these theories is to use the so called seiberg - witten ( sw ) map which is a relation between the fields that are defined on the nc space to their ordinary counterparts defined on the usual commutative space @xcite .",
    "although the existence of such a map is originally derived by taking two different low energy limits of string theory , soon after it was found out by wess and his collaborators that the map exists between nc and commutative gauge theories in a more general setting without referring to the string theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "this construction is purely algebraic and works for arbitrary gauge groups such as @xmath1 .",
    "the sw map is a gauge equivalence relation between nc and commutative gauge theories .",
    "it can be solved by studying the map at each order of the deformation ( noncommutativity ) parameter @xmath2 . as a result",
    ", the commutative counterpart of the nc theory contains new interaction and higher derivative terms at each order in @xmath2 .    at first sight , it can be thought that to study the first order solution of the sw ",
    "map is sufficient to obtain the leading contribution , for instance to the nc standard model@xcite .",
    "however , higher order terms are also needed to study the consistency of the nc theory itself , such as renormalizability . moreover ,",
    "when nc gravity is considered , the first order contributions in @xmath2 from the sw  map vanish identically .",
    "therefore , one has to know at least the second order solutions .",
    "second order solutions are studied by several authors@xcite@xcite .",
    "these maps are different from each other up to a homogeneous solution with different coefficients due to the freedom in the solutions @xcite .    on the other hand , the solution of sw  map to _ all orders _ in @xmath2 for the gauge field , matter field ( both in adjoint and fundamental representation ) and the gauge parameter is given in ref .. these solutions match with the second order solutions given in ref.s .    the advantage of the solutions given in ref .",
    "is that they are given recursively in terms of lower order solutions and hence it simplifies considerably to study the higher order contributions in @xmath2 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that these solutions can also be rewritten in a geometric setting and they are compatible with hermiticity and charge conjugation conditions@xcite .",
    "our aim in this short note , is first to review the results given in ref . in a slightly different setting@xcite and",
    "then to comment on the general structure of the homogeneous solutions of the sw  map to all orders .",
    "moreover , we also show that the contribution of the first order homogeneous solution to the second order can be written again in terms of the first order homogeneous solutions , similar to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "the simplest non - commutative space is the deformation of the ordinary minkowski space with a real constant antisymmetric parameter @xmath2 : @xmath3 _ * \\equiv { x } ^\\mu \\ , * \\ , { x } ^\\nu - { x } ^\\nu \\ , * \\ , { x } ^\\mu = i\\t^{\\mu\\nu } .\\ ] ] the non  commutativity is realized with the @xmath4product of groenewold ",

    "nc field theories are obtained by replacing the ordinary products with the @xmath4product .",
