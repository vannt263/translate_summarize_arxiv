    "the strong coupling constant and the quark masses constitute the fundamental parameters of the standard model .",

    "the results can be compared with independent determinations from high energy experiments .",
    "in the course of evaluating these fundamental parameters we need the process of renormalization in some scheme .",
    "the @xmath1 scheme is one of the most popular schemes , and hence one would like to evaluate the running coupling constant and quark masses through input of low energy quantities on the lattice and convert it to the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "a difficulty in this process is that the conversion is given only in a perturbative expansion , and should be performed at much higher energy scales than the qcd scale . at the same time",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath4 should be kept much smaller than the lattice cut - off to reduce lattice artifacts .",
    "furthermore we may need to suppress artifacts due to a finite lattice extension @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore require @xmath6 the practical difficulty of satisfying these inequalities in numerical simulations is called the window problem .    the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme @xcite is designed to solve the window problem .",
    "it has an advantage that systematic errors can be unambiguously controlled .",
    "a unique renormalization scale is introduced through the box size @xmath5 in the chiral limit and the scheme is mass independent .",
    "a wide range of renormalization scales can be covered by the step scaling function ( ssf ) technique .",
    "this matches our goal to obtain the coupling constant and quark masses in the @xmath7 scheme .",
    "the sf scheme has been applied for evaluation of the qcd coupling for @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite cases .    for the quark mass renormalization factor",
    "the sf scheme has been applied for @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite qcd . at low energy scales of @xmath10 mev , where physical input is given ,",
    "we expect the strange quark contribution to be important in addition to those of the up and down quarks .",
    "thus the aim of the present paper is to go one step further and evaluate the quark mass renormalization factor in @xmath0 qcd .",
    "our goal is to renormalize the bare light quark masses and meson decay constants evaluated in two recent large - scale @xmath0 lattice qcd simulations employing non - perturbatively o(a ) improved wilson quark action ; the work of cp - pacs / jlqcd collaboration with relatively heavy pion mass of @xmath2  mev @xcite and that of pacs - cs collaboration with much lighter quark masses down to @xmath3  mev @xcite .",
