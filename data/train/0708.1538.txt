    "random boolean networks are often studied as generic models of gene regulatory networks @xcite@xcite . the ensemble approach to gene regulation ,",

    "a perturbation to one node propagates on average to less than one other node during one time step . in the chaotic phase ,",
    "the difference between two almost identical states increases exponentially fast , since a perturbation propagates on average to more than one node during one time step @xcite .",
    "critical boolean networks balance robustness against perturbations with complex asymptotic attractor dynamics .",
    "since boolean networks are deterministic systems , they eventually settle into periodic attractors .",
    "regarding the behavior in this asymptotic limit , nodes can be classified into three groups .",
    "nodes that are frozen to the same value on every attractor form the frozen core _ _ of a network @xcite .",
    "these nodes give a constant input to other nodes and are otherwise irrelevant .",
    "nodes that are not frozen but have no outputs , or only outputs to other irrelevant nodes , are also classified as irrelevant .",
    "although they might fluctuate , they do not influence the number and periods of attractors .",
    "finally , the relevant nodes are those non - frozen nodes that influence their own state over directed loops .",
    "the recognition of the relevant nodes as the only elements influencing the asymptotic dynamics was an important step in understanding the dynamics of boolean networks @xcite@xcite .    in a biological context",
    ", an attractor is associated with a characteristic dynamically stable pattern of gene expression , which may represent a particular fate of the cell .",
    "the weight of each such attractor can be defined as the probability for a random state in the state space of the network to flow into this attractor .",
    "based on the state space partition into attractors of different weights , we recently introduced a new network parameter , called the basin entropy ( hereafter , simply entropy ) , which measures the uncertainty of the future behavior of a random state .",
    "this entropy was shown to increase with system size in critical network ensembles , whereas for ensembles in the ordered phase and in highly chaotic networks , it approaches a finite value @xcite . from an informational processing perspective",
    ", this means that the complexity of a network increases only with its system size if it operates near the critical regime .",
    "an intuitive understanding of this growing complexity are networks whose relevant nodes are modularly organized and whose complexity increases if new modules accumulate . in living systems ,",
    "transcriptional regulation is often highly modular @xcite@xcite .",

    "boolean network models for several biological gene regulatory circuits have been constructed and were shown to reproduce experimentally observed results @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these often highly - connected subnetworks can be viewed as biological examples of such complex relevant components .    in this work ,",
    "we first numerically study the entropy of complex relevant components as a function of their connectivity .",
    "we show that the probability of such a component to freeze increases with growing connectivity and that its entropy decreases . additionally , we also study the average transient time of a random state until it falls into its attractor .",
    "the calculation of dynamic network parameters , such as the basin entropy , requires the knowledge of the underlying network functions .",
    "this often limits the applicability of such parameters .",
    "we demonstrate that the entropy of a network can also be estimated from time series data by the application of clustering techniques .",
    "this broadens the applicability of this dynamic network parameter to models whose functions are not necessarily known or that are not deterministic . in order to illustrate our results",

    "in a boolean network every gene is identified by a node @xmath0 , whose state @xmath1 indicates whether the gene is switched on or off .",
    "each node @xmath0 receives input from @xmath2 other nodes and its state at the next time step @xmath3 is a boolean function @xmath4 of the states of the nodes it is depending on : @xmath5 .",
    "a network is entirely defined by its directed connectivity graph @xmath6 and the boolean functions @xmath7 assigned to every node .",
    "the state of a network @xmath8 contains the values of all @xmath9 nodes in the network at a given time point @xmath10 .",
    "a boolean network thus defines a deterministic transition matrix @xmath11 on its state space .",
    "a random state @xmath12 that is propagated through the network as@xmath13 generates a time series or trajectory through the state space that finally intersects with itself .",
    "the states that are then revisited infinitely often define the attractor @xmath14 , with the number of states on the attractor equal to @xmath15 also called the attractor size .",
    "transient states that lead into an attractor form its basin of attraction .",
    "the sum of all attractor states and basin states of a certain attractor normalized by the size of the entire state space ( @xmath16 ) define the weight @xmath17 of that attractor .",
    "the weight of an attractor is the probability that a randomly chosen state will flow into this very attractor .",
    "the entropy @xmath18 of the probability distribution defined by @xmath17 is called the _ basin entropy : _",
    "@xmath19 this measure captures the uncertainty of the future dynamic behavior of the system started in a random state .",
    "the scaling of this parameter relative to system size was discussed in @xcite for ensembles of different dynamical regimes .",

    "random networks that propagate a perturbation , on average , to one other node ( @xmath27 ) , are called critical .",
    "classical kauffman networks with a fixed indegree @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are prototypes of critical boolean network ensembles , though it should be noted that this definition of criticality is independent of the actual indegree distribution .",
    "the attractor dynamics of a boolean network are entirely determined by its relevant nodes .",
    "the scaling of these nodes was first discussed in @xcite and derived for a general class of critical network ensembles by drossel , kaufman and mihaljev @xcite@xcite.they presented a stochastic process that removes frozen nodes and nonfrozen irrelevant nodes from a network and ends when there are only potentially relevant nodes left .",
    "we call these nodes ` potentially relevant ' , as some of them may be part of self - freezing loops",
    ". we will discuss this phenomenon below in more detail .",
    "the number of these potentially relevant nodes @xmath30 scales in all critical networks of size @xmath9 and average connectivity @xmath31 as @xmath32 . in the limit of large @xmath9 , almost all these relevant nodes depend on only one relevant node ; the _ proportion _ of relevant nodes depending on more than one relevant input approaches zero ; and the _ number _ of nodes depending on more than two relevant inputs is almost surely zero .",
    "these results agree with structural findings of random graphs at the point of phase transition , where the number of nodes in complex components scales with @xmath33 and each such complex component is almost surely topologically equivalent to a 3-regular multigraph @xcite .",
    "a set of relevant nodes that eventually influence each other s state form a relevant component .",
    "we define the excess @xmath34 of the connection digraph of a component in analogy to the graph theoretic terminology as the difference between the number of arrows @xmath35 between the nodes and the number of nodes @xmath9:@xmath36    the topology of the simplest relevant component is a loop of nodes .",
    "the excess of this component is @xmath37 .",

    "if another edge is added , the boolean function of the node receiving input from two relevant inputs has to be changed . generally , whenever the indegree of a node increases from @xmath42 to @xmath43 variables , a new boolean updating function for @xmath43 variables has to be assigned . by adjusting the bias @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity ] ) ) , we can randomly generate a boolean function of @xmath43 variables so that its expected sensitivity is @xmath45 . if any of the @xmath43 variables happen to be fictitious ( i.e. , toggling their value has no effect on the output ) , we can draw again in order to guarantee that all added edges are irreducible .",
    "this process thus generates random components of arbitrary excess , operating in the critical or slightly supracritical regime .",
    "the only relevant component whose entropy we can discuss analytically is the simple loop . in simple loops all states are attractor states and it is therefore sufficient to know the length @xmath46 of an attractor in order to determine its weight , @xmath47 .",
    "regarding the attractor dynamics , we can substitute an even number of ` negation ' functions in a loop by ` copy ' functions , so that it is sufficient to discuss loops with an even number or an odd number of ` negations ' . in even loops ,",
    "the attractor states that only differ by a rotation of their values belong to the same attractor and attractors can therefore be viewed as an equivalence class under rotation . in combinatorics such an equivalence class is also known as a binary necklace of length @xmath9 .",

    "the entropy can be approximated by considering only those attractors that are of maximal weight , @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the entropy of simple loops scales linearly with its size under synchronous updating .    in terms of the entropy ,",
    "the key difference between complex components with excess @xmath59 compared to simple loops is that the attractor length and weight are no longer correlated . in complex components , attractors of length one",
    "may have even higher weights than larger attractors in the same network .",
    "the mean number and length of attractors of a random component are insufficient in describing its dynamic complexity and we choose to study the entropy as a function of increasing excess see @xcite ] .",
    "when we start increasing the excess of our component from @xmath37 , two qualitatively different things may happen : either all nodes stay relevant and only the attractor dynamics change , or parts of the component or perhaps even the entire component freezes .",
    "this special case of self - freezing loops was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of a _ self - freezing _ component are two nodes that canalize each other to their majority bits , e.g. @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "fig.[fig3 ] shows the decline in the average entropy @xmath68 of the relevant @xmath62 node components as a function of their excess .",
    "the entropy drops sharply for the first few additional edges and decreases slower for @xmath69 . for all studied component sizes",

    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps    as soon as additional edges are introduced into the loop , the average number of attractor states drops substantially and the majority of states become transient states .",

    "the transient time is zero .",
    "if we increase the excess , the transient time first sharply increases , peaks around an excess of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and begins to decrease thereafter as shown in fig .",

    "might , for instance , speed up the process of settling down to a certain cellular state ( corresponding to an attractor ) whereas a high entropy would minimize the required number of genes to perform a classification / decision task .",
    "thus , the ability to rapidly respond to environmental cues by switching to a particular functional cellular state as well as the economy with which cellular information processing and decision - making can be carried out may be evolutionarily selected features of biological networks .    with the declining costs of microarray and other high - throughput technologies",
    ", time series data will be increasingly available from biological experiments , enabling network parameters such as basin entropy and transient time to be studied in a biological context .",
    "our approach to estimate entropy from time series data sketches one possible way how that might be accomplished .",
