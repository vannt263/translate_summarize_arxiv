    "the cosmological expansion of our universe seems to have accelerated in the recent past .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the form of the luminosity distance as a function of the redhshift for distant supernovae @xcite . in the context of homogeneous cosmology ,",
    "a recent accelerating phase is also in agreement with the observed perturbations in the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "the mechanism that triggered the acceleration has not been identified conclusively .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the cosmological constant is non - zero .",
    "however , the absence of acceleration at redshifts @xmath0 implies that the required value of the cosmological constant is approximately 120 orders of magnitude smaller than its natural value in terms of the planck scale .",
    "one intriguing fact is that the accelerating phase coincides with the period in which inhomogeneities in the matter distribution at length scales @xmath1 mpc become significant , so that the universe can not be approximated as homogeneous any more at these scales .",
    "a link between inhomogeneities and cosmological acceleration has been pursued in various studies .",
    "there have been arguments , based on perturbative estimates , that the backreaction of superhorizon inhomogeneities on the cosmological expansion is significant and could cause the acceleration @xcite",
    ". however , the validity of this effect is questionable @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the importance for the problem of cosmological acceleration of inhomogeneities with sub - horizon characteristic scales today .",
    "because of the significant growth of such inhomogeneities at recent times , a perturbative treatment may not be sufficient .",
    "an exact solution of the einstein equations , even for a simplified geometry , could be more useful in order to reveal an underlying mechanism . the tolman - bondi metric @xcite has been employed often in this context @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has been observed that any form of the luminosity distance as a function of the redshift can be reproduced with this metric @xcite .",
    "a drawback of the standard handling of the tolman - bondi metric is that the radial coordinate is defined such that the fluid density is initially perceived as homogeneous .",
    "the presence of inhomogeneities is introduced through a function that determines the local big bang time .",
    "this obscures the intuition on the role of large mass concentrations .",
    "morever , the growth of perturbations and its effect on the expansion is not obvious .    in our analysis",
    "we choose a gauge such that the initial density perturbation is apparent .",
    "we first model the perturbation by matching a schwarzschild metric in the interior with an exterior tolman - bondi metric .",
    "we show that the presence of a large overdensity modifies the cosmological evolution of the surrounding fluid . in particular ,",
    "accelerating expansion can take place along the radial direction and can be observed through the redshift of light signals propagating radially . on the other hand ,",
    "the expansion perpendicularly to the radial direction is characterized by deceleration .",
    "underdensities do not induce acceleration in any direction .    as an exotic possibility",
    ", we also consider the case of a negative mass at the center .",
    "a fluid with energy density that can become negative has already been discussed in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite a field termed phantom with negative kinetic energy drives the accelerating expansion .",
    "our setup is based on less drastic assumptions .",
    "we consider vacuum solutions of the einstein equations that can be interpreted as arising from objects of negative mass .",
    "the relevant metric is the schwarzschild one with a negative mass .",
    "we show that a pressureless fluid near the center of such a configuration can have accelerating expansion perpendicularly to the radial direction .",
    "we should mention at this point that negative - mass configurations have several features that appear problematic , and their physical significance is not guaranteed .",
    "the negative - mass schwarzschild solution has a naked singularity at the center , so that it violates the cosmic censorship conjecture . however , naked singularities appear often in studies of gravitational collapse for large classes of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "another issue concerns the stability of the negative - mass schwarzschild solution , which has not been proven in full generality . in ref .",
    "@xcite the linear stability has been demonstrated , under a family of boundary conditions at the singularity that have a physical motivation . on the other hand ,",
    "runaway solutions of the einstein equations are known for a pair of objects with positive and negative mass @xcite .",
    "we do not offer here a resolution of these problematic issues .",
    "instead , we point out an interesting feature of the negative - mass schwarzschild solution related to the issue of the cosmological acceleration .",
    "next we consider a homogeneous energy distribution in the central region .",
    "we define an initial condition for the spatial curvature which makes our model very similar to that of spherical collapse @xcite .",
    "a small overdensity grows consistently with the perturbative jeans analysis , until the density fluctuation becomes comparable to the average density .",
    "then , the overdensity starts collapsing .",
    "we study the null geodesics that start outside the perturbation and lead to an observer in its interior .",
    "if the observer is located in the center of the spherical perturbation the geodesics follow the radial direction .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the surrounding fluid is reflected in their form , which , in turn , determines the luminosity distance of a light source as a function of the redshift .    we demonstrate that the expected luminosity distance is consistent with accelerated expansion for a certain range of redshifts . in this work",
    "we do not put emphasis on the exact numerical consistency with the data .",
    "the reason is that we model the fluid in the central collapsing region as pressureless .",
    "this results in a strong deceleration for small redshifts , which is not expected to be present if the cosmological fluid can reach virialization .",
    "our main point is the identification of a mechanism that could drive the observed acceleration .",
    "this mechanism is based on the gravitational force that acts on the fluid surrounding a collapsing overdensity and its effect on the expansion rate .    in the following section we discuss the cosmological expansion in inhomogeneous cosmologies and its dependence on the direction of observation . in section 3",
    "we employ the tolman - bondi metric in order to construct a model for a central inhomogeneity in an asymptotically homogeneous universe . in section 4",
    "we examine if acceleration can be induced by the inhomogeneity along or perpendicularly to the radial direction . in section 5",
    "we study the form of the luminosity distance as a function of the redshift for an observer located at the center of an overdensity . in section 6",
    "we provide a summary of the results and our conclusions .",

    "it is apparent from our discussion that , if the observations lead to an effective averaging of the expansion rate over various directions similar to eq .",

    "this is the case for an observer located _ at the center of an overdensity _ , who receives light signals only in the radial direction . in the second part part of this work ( section 5 ) we studied the luminosity function for such an observer .",
    "the overdensity can not be approximated by a point source any more , as the location of the singularity in the metric would coincide with that of the observer .",
    "for this reason , we assumed a continuous distribution of matter , that is homogeneous in the central region , falls off at larger distances , and asymptotically becomes homogeneous with an energy density smaller than the central one .",
    "we were mainly interested in the light signals that originate in the regions outside the central overdensity .",

    "these results are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] , and demonstrate the possible link between the _ growth of perturbations and the perceived acceleration of the expansion_.    there are several points in the above scenario that require further work .",
    "one is the location of the observer , which is constrained by the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "exact isotropy would require the observer to be located exactly at the center of a spherically symmetric perturbation .",
    "small deviations from complete isotropy , such as the difference of power between the northern and southern hemisphere or possible allignments of the low multipoles @xcite , could possibly allow for an off - center location .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the isotropy appears at a sufficiently large length scale in a configuration with several centers of symmetry .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the radial acceleration can be the dominant contribution to the averaged expansion for a random location of the observer .",
    "the form of the expansion within a collapsing overdensity is another point that has to be addressed in future work . in our model",
    "the cosmological fluid within the overdensity is approximated as pressureless . as a result , the expansion for small redshifts is strongly decelerating .",
    "this makes the comparison with the supernova data problematic .",
    "a more sophisticated model is required in order to describe with quantitative accuracy both the cosmological expansion and the collapse of an overdense region .",
    "another issue concerns the existence of a characteristic scale for the inhomogeneity . in our simple model",
    ", it is apparent from figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] that the presence of acceleration at redshifts @xmath169 forces the redshift of the surface of the overdensity to values @xmath170 . on the other hand",
    ", it is remarkable that perturbations at the level of 10% in the present average density are capable of inducing acceleration in certain directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is possible for such perturbations to be very extensive ( of the order of 100 mpc or even larger ) without being in conflict with observations .    as a final remark",
    "we mention that a series of studies @xcite has considered the possibility that we are located within an underdense region of the universe , while we receive light signals that originate outside this region .",
    "the luminosity - redshift relation in this case could be similar to the one in an accelerating homogeneous universe .",
    "we have verified this conclusion within our model .",
    "the expansion is decelerating for all redshifts , but a significant reduction in the value of the hubble parameter beyond a certain critical value @xmath171 can provide consistency with the supernova data .    *",
