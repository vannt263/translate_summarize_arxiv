    "the simplest of many - electron systems are those with two electrons like ions of the helium isoelectronicc series or a harmonium atom . since the schr@xmath9dinger equation for these systems can not be solved analytically , accurate solutions are obtained by using the variational principle for the energy .",
    "thus an approximate parametrized form of the wavefunction is chosen incorporating the effect of electron - electron interactionon in the wavefunction and the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( atomic units are used ) @xmath10 is minimized with respect to the parameters in the wavefunction .",
    "this leads to an optimized approximate wavefunction and the corresponding energy .",
    "the various forms used for the wavefunctions are those by hylleraas@xcite , chandrasekhar@xcite and kinoshita@xcite . as an example of how these forms incorporate the effect of electron - electron interaction",
    ", we consider the chandrasekhar wavefunction for two - electron atom given as @xmath11 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the parameters to be optimized and @xmath12 is the normalization constant .",
    "the idea behind writing the wavefunction in the form above is as follows . in the ground state of a two electron atom ,",
    "each electron moves essentially in a hydrogen - atom like @xmath13 orbital ( of the form @xmath14)but because of electron closer to nucleus , the effective nuclear charge is different for the outer electron .",
    "hence the parameters for the orbitals of the two electrons are different .",
    "symmetrization of the resulting product wavefunction then leads to the form given in equation @xmath15 .",
    "another way of obtaining accurate wavefunctions has been given by hylleraas@xcite where the wavefunction is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 ,  @xmath18 ,   @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are variational parameters .",
    "the most accurate calculation using this form of the wavefunction has been that of frankowski and pekeris@xcite , who used a @xmath22-term wavefunction to get highly accurate energies for the helium isoelctronic series . employing a @xmath23-term wavefunction freund et al .",
    "@xcite got essentially the same results as those of @xcite . using another modification to hylleraas type wavefunction ,",
    "koga @xcite constructed a @xmath8-term wavefunction that gives energy within @xmath24 nano - hartree of the energy given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , usefulness of the work of @xcite lies in the fact that they expressed the electronic density of the @xmath8-parameter wavefunction in a simple analytical form with @xmath25 parameters . along similar lines , in @xmath26 umrigar and gonze@xcite",
    "constructed very accurate densities for he isoelectronic series by using @xmath27-term wave function having the same form of the basis set as used by freund .",
    "the resulting densities have been used in the past to construct exchange - correlation potential@xcite and to calculate@xcite polarizability of two electron atoms and also to study derivative discontinuity of the exchange - correlation@xcite of potential of density functional theory .",
    "examples of references @xcite are sufficient to show that the availability of accurate densities facilitate studies in fundamental aspects of density functional theory@xcite . as such methods that can give accurate densities with relative ease are desirable to facilitates such studies . with this in mind",
    "le sech@xcite introduced a semianalytical wavefunction for the ground state of two electron atoms and ions that gives energy within parts per million ( ppm ) of the answers of references @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction proposed by le sech is motivated by the intuitive aspects of the chandrashekhar wavefunction and correlation factor given by earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction is given as @xmath28 where @xmath12 is the normalization constant and @xmath29 is the atomic number of the atomic system .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is chosen so that cusp condition@xcite is satisfied exactly by the wavefunction .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are obtained variationally by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to them .",
    "the energies so obtained for h^-^ , he , li^+^ , be^2+^ , b^3+^ are given in along with the exact energies obtained in @xcite .",
    "the differences between the two energies are also shown .",
    "we mention that the values of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the corresponding energies obtained by us are slightly different from those reported in ref @xcite .",
    "it is clear from that the wavefunction @xmath31 of leads to accurate energies with the difference from those of @xcite becoming smaller with increasing z. the difference for h^-^ is @xmath32 parts per million and goes down to @xmath33for @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the wavefunction of can be improved further with the inclusion of one more parameter and leads to a closer agreement with the exact energies .",
    "+    the question we now ask is how accurate are the densities given by @xmath31 ?",
    "this is important from the point of view of having an accurate and easily accesible density of two electron systems if we were to employ them to investigate the foundational aspects of density functional theory of many electron systems in general and two electron systems in particular . to this end",
    "we present in the values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and in table [ tb3 ] and [ tb4 ] various moments of the densities obtained from the le sech wavefunction .",
    "a comparision of the results is made with the accurate values of those obtained from the densities given in @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the densities given by @xmath31 are smaller than the exact values of the densities at @xmath37 . since the kato - cusp condition is satisfied by both @xmath31 and @xmath38 , the derivative @xmath39 are also small in comparision with the exact density .",
    "this implies that the le sech densities may be little more spread out than the exact densities .",
    "next in and , we present various moments of the density obtained from @xmath40 of and compare them with their exact counterparts .",
    "it is seen that @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath40 are less than those obtained from@xcite the exact density .",
    "this is consistent with the density for @xmath40 being smaller than the exact one near the nucleus . for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the hand",
    ", it is observed that their values are larger than the exact moments for most of the cases ( exception is for h^-^ ) .",
    "this again shows that for @xmath40 , the density is more spread out in general .",
    "we also test the density in terms of it satisfying the ionization potential ( @xmath46 ) theorem in kohn - sham density functional theory .",
    "furthermore , we also study the accuracy of the corresponding kohn - sham exchange - correlation potential . according to the @xmath46 theorem",
    "@xcite the highest occupied orbital eigenenergy is equal to negative of the ionization potential of a many electron system .",
    "accordingly for a kohn - sham system for a given ground - state density of two electron system , its eigenvalue should be equal to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy of the two - electron system . to test the accuracy of the le sech densities ,",
    "we construct the corresponding kohn - sham system using the zhao - parr@xcite method , which is described briefly in the following .",
    "+    for the orbitals of noninteracting system of electrons the kinetic energy @xmath49 and ground state density @xmath50 are given by + @xmath51 for a given ground state density , the kohn - sham system is formed by minimizing @xmath52 with respect to @xmath53 s with the constraint . @xmath54[\\rho(r')-\\rho_{0}(r')]}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|}}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r'}=0",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] which is equivalent to @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|}}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r ' }   \\label{pzp}\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the lagrangian multipliers to enforce the two constraints above .",
    "is solved self - consistently using a herman - skillman@xcite program modified suitably . since at the solution point @xmath61",
    ", the value of @xmath59 should go to infinity such that @xmath62 remains finite . in this paper",
    "we have performed all the calculations for @xmath63 .",
    "we point out that for two electron systems , the kohn - sham systems can also be found directly from the laplacian of the density .",
    "we however , chose zhao - parr method because it is more general and more accurate .    shown in",
    "are the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath31 for the ions studied in this paper .",
    "it is seen for @xmath40 that the values of @xmath66 and @xmath65 are comparable to each other . however , they are not close enough to satisfy the @xmath46 theorem . furthermore , the values of @xmath65 are close to the experimental ionization potential , which shows that the total energies @xmath48 for @xmath40 is accurate . on the other hand @xmath64",
    "is not accurate for @xmath40 .",
    "this is particularily evident for the densities of the @xmath67 ion and he atom where the difference between the two is @xmath68 and @xmath69 , percent respectively .",
    "since the eigenvalue @xmath66 is determined by the asymptotic decay of the electron density , it is evident that asymptotically , the density given by le sech wavefunction is not accurate .",
    "this is further evidenced by the corresponding kohn - sham exchange - correlation shown in figure @xmath70 where we have plotted the exchange - correlation potential of he for both le sech density as well as the density given in@xcite and another accurate density of umrigar and gonze@xcite .",
    "it is clear that le sech density leads to smaller magnitude of the exchange - correlation potential near the nucleus , which in turn gives densities which are more spread out .",
    "+    comparision of the exchange - correlation potential calculated for given le sech density ( @xmath71 ) , modified le sech density ( @xmath72 ) and for the density given in@xcite ( @xmath73 ) and for the accurate density of umrigar and gonze@xcite(@xmath74).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] [ figure ]    it is evident from the results presented so for that the le sech wavefunction needs to be improved if it were to give accurate densities .",
    "the rest of the paper is then devoted to modifying the le sech wavefunction so that it leads to densities that can be employed to study exact properties in density functional theory .",
    "we wish to point out that after completing our work , we discovered that the above equation was solved@xcite in @xmath89 to obtain ground state energy and polarizability of the he atom .",
    "however the scope of the present paper is much wider . in this paper",
    "we investigate the wavefunction not only for the energy but also for the density it gives rise to .",
    "we present the results obtained by solving for the two electron atomic systems studied so for and show the accuracy of the energy as well as the density that is achieved by self - consistently determined @xmath80 . from the results presented below ,",
    "it becomes clear that provides a computationally straightforward method of obtaining highly accurate wavefunctions for two - electron systems .",
    "the method can also be applied with equal ease to other two - electrons systems such as electrons in a confined environment or harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "+    given in are the results for the total energies of the modified le sech wavefunction @xmath80 of . as is evident , for the modified wavefunction",
    ", the total energies are better than those for the le sech functions .",
    "the modified wavefuction reduces the error of energies from le sech wavefunction by roughly a factor of @xmath90 .",
    "this is because the wavefunctions has been made more flexible .",
    "in addition to giving improved energies , @xmath80 also gives much better densities than @xmath40 .",
    "we present these results in the following .",
    "+    in , we also present the density and its derivative at @xmath37 obtained from @xmath80 of .",
    "we see that the values of modified le sech density and its derivative are very close the values obtained using exact expression given in @xcite . in and we present the various moments of the density obtained by @xmath80 . these moments are compared with the moments given in @xcite .",
    "we get all the moments calculated by the modified le sech density close to the moments given in @xcite .",
    "this implies that the modified le sech density is very close to the exact density .",
    "+    in , @xmath46 theorem is tested for both le sech and modified le sech density , where the @xmath66 are calculated by solving equation ( 7 ) .",
    "we see that the modified le sech density satifies the @xmath46 theorem almost exactly .",
    "finallly in we show the exchange - correlation potential by using le sech density , modified le sech density , density given in@xcite and for the density obtained by umrigar and gonze@xcite .",
    "we see that the exchange - correlation potential given by modified le sech densities is very close to the exact potential .",
    "le sech wavefunction@xcite , which gives very accurate energies for he - like systems , has been modified so that both the energies and densities obtained from the modified wavefunction are highly accurate .",
    "the densities so obtained can be used with confidence to perform fundamental density functional theory investigations . along this line of investigation",
    "we are now employing the method proposed to study adiabatic connection in density functional theory .",
