    "vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) processes have emerged as a particularly interesting class of scattering events from which one hopes to gain insight into the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the most prominent example is higgs boson production via vbf , that is , the process @xmath7 , which can be viewed as quark scattering via @xmath8-channel exchange of a weak boson , with the higgs boson radiated off the @xmath0 or @xmath1 propagator .",
    "alternatively , one may view this process as two weak bosons fusing to form the higgs boson .",
    "the kinematic characteristics of this process are very distinctive : two jets , in the forward and backward region of rapidity , with the higgs boson decay products in the central region of the detector .",
    "this characteristic signature greatly helps to distinguish these @xmath9 events from backgrounds .",
    "higgs boson production via vbf has been studied intensively as a tool for higgs boson discovery  @xcite and the measurement of higgs boson couplings  @xcite in @xmath10 collisions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "analogous to higgs boson production via vbf , the electroweak production of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 plus two jets , with the requirement that the weak boson is centrally produced and that the two jets are well separated in rapidity , will proceed with sizable cross section at the lhc or @xmath11 events are qcd processes at order @xmath12 , sometimes called qcd @xmath13 production . within typical vbf cuts , cross sections for these qcd processes are only somewhat larger than those for electroweak production  @xcite .",
    "one thus needs to calculate nlo qcd corrections for both sources independently , and as a function of phase space . for",
    "the qcd processes this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "the decay leptons in @xmath14 and @xmath15 lead to the final states @xmath2 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these processes have already been considered in the literature at leading order ( lo ) . to name but a few examples ,",
    "they have been studied in the investigation of rapidity gaps at hadron colliders  @xcite , as a probe of anomalous triple - gauge - boson couplings  @xcite or as a background to higgs boson searches in vbf  @xcite . in this last case , the @xmath4 final state with an unidentified charged lepton , or @xmath18 events from @xmath19 decay , form a background to invisible higgs boson decay ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xmath20 events are a background to the decay @xmath21",
    "@xcite , and also to @xmath22 when the @xmath0 s and the @xmath23 s decay leptonically  @xcite . in these examples ,",
    "off - shell corrections to @xmath24 decay need to be included , since a higgs boson mass in the range @xmath25 , well above the @xmath1 peak , is favored by electroweak data  @xcite .    while a lo analysis is perfectly adequate for exploratory investigation , precision measurements at the lhc require comparison with cross - section predictions which include higher - order qcd corrections .",
    "a poignant example is the extraction of higgs boson couplings , where expected accuracies of the order of 10% , or even better  @xcite , clearly require knowledge of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections .",
    "in addition , one would like to exploit @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , in vbf configurations , as calibration processes for higgs boson production via vbf , namely as a tool to understand the tagging of forward jets or the distribution and veto of additional central jets in vbf ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "in fact , these processes share the same color structure : two colored quarks are scattered via the exchange of a colorless boson in the @xmath8-channel .",
    "the pattern of soft gluon radiation is then the same .",
    "understanding the gap - survival probability in the known case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production can give insight on the gap survival for the case of higgs boson production . the precision needed for higgs boson studies and for the understanding of radiation patterns then requires the knowledge of nlo qcd corrections for @xmath26 and @xmath11 production as well .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to the total @xmath9 cross section from vbf has been known for many years  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "we presented the calculation of these corrections in the form of a fully - flexible parton - level monte carlo program which allows the determination of nlo corrections to arbitrary ( infrared - safe ) distributions . here , we extend this work and describe the calculation and first results for such corrections to @xmath26 and @xmath11 production in vbf configurations . to be precise , since the decaying weak bosons are spin - one particles , in order to retain all the possible angular correlations between the final state particles , we consider the electroweak processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 at nlo .    at lo , feynman graphs for one such process , @xmath29 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ] . using the terminology introduced in  @xcite , we consider bremsstrahlung ( a , b , c ) , fusion  ( d ) and multiperipheral ( e , f ) diagrams .",
    "we neglect diagrams corresponding to conversion , abelian and non - abelian annihilation , since these @xmath30 annihilation contributions are negligible when we impose vbf cuts , as explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : approximations ] .    in the following , in order to use a shorthand notation , we will call processes such as the one depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : feynborn ] `` ew @xmath13 production '' , or vbf production of @xmath31 plus two jets , since we consider these processes with the kinematic cuts typical for the selection of vbf ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] ) .",
    "it should be understood that , in spite of this notation , multiperipheral diagrams like  ( e ) and  ( f ) are included , even though they can not be represented as the production of a weak boson , followed by its decay into two leptons .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] , we outline the calculation of the tree - level diagrams , of real - emission contributions and of the virtual corrections .",

    "[ sec : mc ] .",
    "we then use this monte carlo program to present first results for ew @xmath13 production at the lhc .",

    "diagrams obtained by interchange of identical initial- or final - state ( anti)quarks , such as in the @xmath39 or @xmath40 subprocesses .",
    "these additional diagrams are obtained from the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ] by crossing . in our calculation",
    ", we have neglected contributions from vector - boson pair production completely .",
    "in addition , any interference effects of the second class with the graphs of fig .  [",
    "fig : feynborn ] are neglected .",
    "this is justified because , in the phase - space region where vbf can be observed experimentally , with widely - separated quark jets of very large invariant mass , the neglected terms are strongly suppressed by large momentum transfer in one or more weak - boson propagators .",
    "color suppression further reduces any interference terms .",
    "we have checked with madevent  @xcite that , at lo , the diagrams that we have not considered and interference effects contribute less than 0.3% to our final results in e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_depw ] .",
    "since we expect qcd corrections to the neglected terms to be modest , the above approximations are fully justified within the accuracy of our nlo calculation .",
    "fermion masses are set to zero throughout , because observation of either leptons or ( light ) quarks in a hadron - collider environment requires large transverse momenta and hence sizable scattering angles and relativistic energies .",
    "for the @xmath8-channel processes which we include , we have used a diagonal form ( equal to the identity matrix ) for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , @xmath41 .",
    "this approximation is not a limitation of our calculation .",
    "as long as no final - state quark flavor is tagged ( no @xmath42 tagging is done , for example ) , the sum over all flavors , using the exact @xmath41 , is equivalent to our results , due to the unitarity of the @xmath41 matrix .         for the @xmath26 born amplitude ,",
    "we need to add the contributions from the 10 feynman graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ] ( @xmath1 and @xmath43 propagators counted as different diagrams ) , and sum cross sections of all subprocesses producing @xmath37 plus two jets .",
    "the same is true for @xmath44 production . for the case of @xmath11 production ,",
    "amplitudes which correspond to neutral - current exchange ( no change of quark flavors ) receive contributions from 24 feynman graphs at tree level . to obtain the real - emission diagrams , with a final - state gluon",
    ", one needs to attach the gluon to the quark lines in all possible ways . for the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ] , this gives rise to 45 real - emission graphs .",
    "112 different feynman graphs contribute to real - emission corrections to @xmath11 production via neutral - current exchange .",
    "the contributions with an initial - state gluon are obtained by crossing the previous diagrams , promoting the final - state gluon as incoming parton , and an initial - state ( anti)quark as final - state particle .",
    "we again remove all diagrams where two time - like , final - state vector bosons appear such as @xmath45 , with @xmath46 . such diagrams , for consistency , must be removed since we have not considered the corresponding born contributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : feyndrop ] clarifies this issue : we drop all initial - gluon contributions in which the gluon couples to the fermion line of the initial quark or antiquark .",
    "in fact , these diagrams are strongly suppressed when vbf cuts ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : pheno ] ) are applied to the final - state jets .",
    "our monte carlo program computes all amplitudes numerically , using the formalism of ref .",
    "the born amplitudes for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production are taken from ref .",
    "the real - emission amplitudes for @xmath1 production were first given in ref .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes for @xmath0 production were partially programed at the time . we have finalized and tested them for the present application .      at nlo",
    ", we have to deal with soft and collinear singularities in the virtual and real - emission contributions .",
    "our calculation uses the subtraction method of catani and seymour  @xcite to cancel the soft and collinear divergences between virtual and real - emission diagrams .",
    "since these divergences only depend on the color structure of the external partons , the subtraction terms encountered for ew @xmath13 production are identical in form to those found for higgs boson production in vbf .",
    "thus , we can use the results described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case at hand .",
    "the main difference is that the finite parts of the virtual corrections are more complicated than for @xmath9 production ( where only vertex corrections were present ) .",
    "the qcd corrections to ew @xmath13 production appear as two gauge - invariant subsets , corresponding to corrections to the upper and lower fermion lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ] . due to the color singlet nature of the exchanged electroweak bosons , any interference terms between subamplitudes with gluons attached to both the upper and the lower quark lines vanish identically at order @xmath47 .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider radiative corrections to a single quark line only , which we here take as the upper one .",
    "corrections to the lower fermion line are an exact copy .    in computing the virtual corrections , we have used the dimensional reduction scheme  @xcite : we have performed the passarino - veltman reduction of the tensor integrals in @xmath48 dimensions , while the algebra of the dirac gamma matrices , of the external momenta and of the polarization vectors has been performed in @xmath49 dimensions .    we split the virtual corrections into two classes : the virtual corrections along a quark line with only one weak boson attached and the virtual corrections along a quark line with two weak bosons attached .    * i. * the virtual nlo qcd contribution to any tree level feynman subamplitude @xmath50 which has a single electroweak boson @xmath51 ( of momentum @xmath52 ) attached to the upper fermion line , q(k_1 ) q(k_2 ) + v(q ) , appears in the form of a vertex correction , which is factorisable in terms of the original born subamplitude [ eq : vertexvirt ] m_v^(i ) = m_b^(i ) c_f @xmath53^(1 + ) --+c_virt + . here",

    "we have added the maximum deviations for each error eigenvector in quadrature , and we have found a total pdf uncertainty of @xmath169 with the cteq pdfs , and of roughly @xmath170 with the mrst set .    for precise comparisons with future lhc data , the residual theoretical error on the jet and lepton distributions must be estimated . as a first example , we show the transverse - momentum distribution of the highest-@xmath171 tagging jet for @xmath132 production in fig .  [",

    "the ratio of the two nlo distributions deviates from unity by 2% or less over the entire range , which , again , points to the small qcd dependence of our calculation .",
    "in contrast to the stability of the nlo result , the lo curves depend appreciably on the scale choice . the blue dotted line and the red dashed line in fig .  [ fig : pt_max_tagj ] ( b ) give the ratio of the lo curves for @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively , to the nlo result .",
    "the shape of the lo curves , in particular for a constant scale choice like @xmath175 , is quite different from the more reliable nlo result . for transverse - momentum distributions",
    "we generally find that the `` dynamical '' scale choice @xmath174 , at lo , better reproduces the shape of the nlo distributions , and is thus preferable to a fixed scale . at nlo , or higher order , where the definition of the momentum transfer @xmath163 becomes more problematic ,",
    "the fixed - scale choice becomes more natural .",
    "however , because of the greater stability of the cross - section prediction , the scale selection also becomes less of a phenomenological issue .",
    "rapidity distributions of the two tagging jets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : y_tags ] , at lo and nlo , and for two choices of the rapidity - gap requirement , @xmath136 and @xmath131 .",
    "the shapes of the rapidity distributions for the more central tagging jet , panel  ( a ) , and the more forward tagging jet , panel  ( b ) , are quite similar at lo and nlo .",

    "curves for the @xmath132 and @xmath11 cross sections are very similar in shape and show the preservation of shape between lo and nlo curves .    while tagging - jet distributions are quite similar for electroweak @xmath26 and @xmath11 events at the lhc , the presence of two charged leptons in the @xmath11 case results in somewhat more noticeable differences . when considering changes in the lepton @xmath171 cut of eq",

    "[ fig : pt_l_min ] ( b , d ) . varying either scales by a factor of 2 leads to the same conclusion of 1%2% scale uncertainties for the nlo results . comparing",
    "the lo predictions ( dashed and dot - dashed curves ) with the very precise nlo results shows theoretical errors of the order of 10% .",
    "again , as for the jet @xmath171 distributions discussed earlier , the choice @xmath174 is better for simulating the shape of the lepton @xmath171 distribution at lo .",
    "a fixed scale , @xmath179 , predicts too steep a fall - off at large @xmath171 .",
    "one should note , however , that for the electroweak @xmath13 processes considered here , these differences are exceptionally small already at lo : the differences between the lo curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : pt_l_min ] are of the order of 10% only .",
    "in contrast to the lepton transverse - momentum distributions described above , the shape of the lepton - rapidity distributions is virtually unaffected by the nlo corrections : an overall constant @xmath176 factor is sufficient to describe nlo effects .",
    "larger changes are found when considering angular correlations of the leptons and jets , which we show for @xmath11 production in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_y_l_tag_min ] .",
    "the top panels show the minimal rapidity between any of the two leptons and the two tagging jets , @xmath180 .",
    "as before , the tagging jets are taken as the two highest transverse - momentum jets in the event ( @xmath171 selection ) .",
    "the two bottom panels show the minimal separation in the rapidity - azimuthal angle plane of the two leptons from any jet ( not necessarily the two tagging jets ) in the event , @xmath181 . in both cases , the two scale choices for the nlo result show excellent agreement ( black solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_y_l_tag_min ] ( b , d ) ) .",
    "however , the dynamical @xmath176 factors k(x ) = for @xmath182 and @xmath183 show qualitatively different behavior .",
    "while @xmath184 is fairly constant , i.e. , the shape of the distribution is well described by the lo approximation , the minimal lepton - jet separation , @xmath185 , shifts noticeably to smaller values at nlo .",
    "this behavior was to be expected , since additional parton emission in the higher - order calculation reduces lepton isolation .",
    "what is remarkable , then , is that the selection of the tagging jets as the two highest-@xmath171 jets does not affect the lepton - tagging jet separation . as for the higgs boson case  @xcite , this selection of the tagging jets provides excellent correspondence of the lo- and nlo - event topology .    in order to stress this point",
    "we show dijet invariant - mass distributions for the reconstructed jets ( not necessarily the two tagging jets ) for @xmath132 events at lo ( red dashed lines ) and at nlo ( solid black lines ) in fig .",

    ", additional parton emission provides for soft third jets which form low invariant - mass pairs with one of the tagging jets , and this pair shows up as a low - mass peak in @xmath188 .",
    "generic selections of the two tagging jets in a multijet environment tend to pick up some of these low - mass pairs and lead to substantial differences in the invariant - mass distribution of the two tagging jets at lo and at nlo .",
    "the @xmath171 selection of tagging jets , which we have used throughout and for which results are shown in fig .  [ fig : m_jj_min_wp ] ( b ) , is remarkable in that it preserves the shape of the tagging jet invariant - mass distribution , @xmath189 , when going from lo to nlo .",
    "vector - boson fusion at the lhc represents a class of electroweak processes which are under excellent control perturbatively .",
    "this has been known for some time for the most interesting process in this class : higgs boson production via vbf has a modest @xmath176 factor of about 1.05 for the inclusive production cross section  @xcite and this result also holds when applying realistic acceptance cuts  @xcite .    in the present paper , we have extended this result to the electroweak production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 plus two jets , when the final - state particles are in a kinematic configuration typical of vbf events .",
    "more precisely , we have calculated the nlo qcd corrections to electroweak production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at lhc , and we have implemented them in a fully - flexible nlo monte carlo program .",
    "@xmath176 factors are of the same size as for the higgs boson production process , typically ranging between 1.0 and 1.1 for most distributions .",
    "what is more important is the stability of the nlo result : residual scale dependence is at the 2% level or below .",
    "this is smaller than the present parton - distribution - function uncertainties , which we have calculated for the @xmath168 cross sections .",
    "we estimate 4% pdf errors using cteq6 m parton distributions and roughly half that size using mrst2001e pdfs .    given the excellent theoretical control which we now have for ew @xmath13 production , these processes can be used as testing grounds for higgs boson production in vbf : techniques should be developed to measure hadronic properties , like forward - jet tagging efficiencies or central - jet - veto probabilities , in @xmath26 or @xmath11 production at the lhc and to extrapolate these results to higgs boson production , thus reducing the systematic errors for higgs boson coupling measurements .",
