    "although disordered metallic systems have been studied extensively for many years , a reasonably complete theoretical understanding has only been developed for noninteracting particles,@xcite and the effect of interactions in disordered media is an open and challenging problem .    in 1958 , anderson@xcite proposed that noninteracting electrons may be localized by the interference of wavefunctions elastically scattered off of multiple impurities even in situations in which the electrons are classically unconfined .",
    "extensive studies@xcite since then have produced a clear picture of the anderson transition . in @xmath1 dimensions , and for sufficient disorder",
    ", single - particle wavefunctions at the band edges are localized , and decay exponentially on a scale referred to as the localization length , @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 is a function of energy , and diverges at the upper and lower mobility edges @xmath3 which separate localized and extended states ; states with energies @xmath4 or @xmath5 are localized , while states with @xmath6 are extended .",
    "the mobility edges move towards the band center as disorder is increased , and a metal - insulator transition occurs when either mobility edge crosses the fermi level .",
    "the question of how electron - electron interactions influence the interference effects responsible for anderson localization has received much attention @xcite with calculations using mean field , diagrammatic perturbation and renormalization techniques .",
    "while much has been learned , a clear understanding of the strong interaction limit has not been achieved . recently a number of approaches have been developed to use dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) methods to study the mott - anderson metal - insulator transiton . @xcite in its original form dmft is a local approximation in which a single site is embedded in an effective medium .",
    "the distinction from standard mean - field theory is that the on - site interaction is treated exactly , and the effective medium is chosen to approximate the effects of other interactions .",
    "one solves self - consistently for the local single - particle green s function @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a position and @xmath9 a complex frequency .",
    "dmft captures the physics of the interaction - driven metal - insulator transition@xcite ( the mott transition ) , but two significant challenges arise in its application to the study of the anderson transition .",
    "first , one must capture the subtle physics of localization within an effective medium theory and , second , one must extract information about nonlocal behavior from the local green s function .",
    "the first problem has been the topic of recent work , @xcite while the focus of the current article is the second : what quantity calculable from the local green s function is a practical measure of localization ?    for numerical calculations on noninteracting - electron systems , a number of convenient measures exist : including the thouless number,@xcite spectral statistics,@xcite and especially the inverse participation ratio@xcite ( ipr ) . a key point",
    ", however , is that in the absence of electron - electron interactions the many - body wavefunction is a product of well - defined single particle eigenstates , and all of these methods rely on knowledge of these states .",
    "however , in interacting systems no such states exist .",
    "a possible approach is suggested by the fact@xcite that for a system with localized states the local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath10 , has a discrete spectrum . in an infinite system",
    "the density of states of the whole system ( dos ) is in general a continuous function of @xmath11 , and when the states are extended the ldos is correspondingly continuous .",
    "however , in an infinite system with localized states the dos will remain continuous while the ldos becomes discrete .",
    "@xcite this has been discussed more recently in the context of non - interacting electrons by a number of authors.@xcite    with this in mind , the geometric average of the density of states ( gados ) @xmath12^{1/n } , \\label{gados}\\ ] ] has been proposed @xcite as a possible order parameter of the anderson localization transition .",
    "note that if the ldos at a given energy @xmath11 is zero on _ any _ site , the gados at that energy will be zero .",
    "therefore , in an infinite system @xmath13 signals a metal - insulator transition , where @xmath14 corresponds to the fermi level .    in this paper",
    "we explore some potential pitfalls in the use of this measure .",
    "our central results are ( 1 ) that a finite energy resolution changes the scaling behavior of @xmath0 and makes the determination of the mobility edges difficult and ( 2 ) that simply a decline , as opposed to a zero , in the gados is not uniquely associated with the phenomenon of localization .",
    "we arrive at these conclusions in the context of a system of non - interacting electrons on a lattice with random potential values at each site ( section [ ssec - model ] ) .",
    "first , we consider finite - size systems and use a standard numerical diagonalization approach ( section [ ssec - enc ] ) . in these systems ,",
    "the density of states is discrete , but a spectrum similar to the thermodynamic result can be obtained by inserting a finite energy resolution , a process mathematically parallel to the presence of an inelastic scattering rate .",
    "we demonstrate ( section [ ssec - rnd - finite ] ) some misinterpretations which may arise , we sketch the scaling procedures , explored in more detail elsewhere,@xcite which provide reliable phase information , and we examine in particular the influence of a finite energy resolution on the scaling behavior .",
    "second , we treat the infinite system within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) ( section [ ssec - cpa ] ) .",
    "this method is known to accurately reproduce the disorder - averaged dos while not capturing the multiple - scattering processes responsible for anderson localization .",
    "we find ( section [ ssec - rnd - infinite ] ) that the cpa gados declines with increasing disorder and suggest that this is due to small wavefunction amplitudes at sites of extreme potential . in summary ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on disorder strength alone , in the absence of a clearly defined zero , is not a reliable measure of localization , and furthermore when the energy resolution is finite , scaling will be affected .",
    "in this work , we will use a site - disordered model , in which the site energies @xmath15 take random values , while the hopping matrix element @xmath16 is fixed . for the simplest case of spinless fermions , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates nearest neighbour sites on the lattice , and @xmath19 is a ket corresponding to the wannier orbital attached to the @xmath20th site . in this work",

    "the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) describes noninteracting fermions , so that exact single - particle eigenstates may be found by numerically diagonalizing , using the lapack libraries , the matrix @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is one for nearest neighbor sites and zero otherwise . for a system with @xmath28 sites , we obtain eigenvalues @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and corresponding eigenvectors @xmath31 .",
    "we consider systems of linear size @xmath32 ( measured in units of the lattice constant ) and dimension @xmath33 or 3 , having @xmath34 lattice sites in total .",
    "to calculate the gados using the numerical solution , the ldos is obtained from the resulting eigenvectors : @xmath35 in numerical calculations , where one has a discrete spectrum , one generally approximates the delta - function by bins of width @xmath36 : @xmath37 the ldos approaches the thermodynamic result when @xmath38 where @xmath39^{-1 } \\sim 4dt / n$ ] is the energy level spacing due to the finite size of the system .",
    "this binning procedure is essentially equivalent to approximating @xmath40 which is significant because it provides a point of reference between our results and results for many - body calculations of the single - particle green s function .",
    "the dos is the arithmetic average of this : @xmath41 , while the gados is as defined in eq .",
    "( [ gados ] ) .",
    "representative examples of our results for the dos and the gados in both one and three dimensions are shown in fig .",

    ", we calculate the ldos using eq .",
    "( [ ldos ] ) ( a procedure which is only possible for noninteracting systems ) in which case @xmath44 is only nonzero for energies corresponding to an energy eigenvalue .",
    "this result is subsequently smoothed using a binning procedure .",
    "note the key distinction that when @xmath42 the binning is done after the gados is calculated .",
    "an important technical issue which must be discussed is disorder averaging . in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , we typically present results which have been averaged over several hundred impurity configurations . for @xmath45 and for the ipr ,",
    "this is a meaningful process .",
    "for @xmath0 it is less clear whether one should take the arithmetic average or the geometric average , as was done in ref .  [ ] , of different samples .",
    "we have studied both averaging procedures and have determined that they yield similar results , except for small values of @xmath46 , for which the geometric averaging becomes unreliable : if any particular disorder configuration fails to have an eigenvalue in a particular bin , then @xmath0 vanishes for that bin . for this reason , we find that geometrically averaging disorder configurations for @xmath0 exaggerates the already high sensitivity of the gados to single sites with high potential , and we have adopted the arithmetic average for calculating the disorder average of @xmath0 .    for purposes of comparison , it is also useful to calculate the ipr,@xcite which is known to be a reliable and sensitive measure of localization . for normalized eigenstates , the ipr for eigenstate",
    "@xmath47 is @xmath48 and it is common to average the ipr over energy bins of width @xmath36 according to @xmath49 it is the scaling of these quantities with system size which determines whether states are localized : for a system with @xmath28 sites , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 scale as @xmath52 for extended states , but saturate at a finite value when the localization length @xmath2 is less than the linear dimension @xmath32 of the system . in practice when systems with @xmath53 are calculationally inaccessible",
    ", localization can be inferred when @xmath51 vs. @xmath52 extrapolates to a nonzero value .",
    "the cpa is the second approach we take to determine the electronic structure of our model .",
    "this is an effective medium theory , modelling a randomly distributed impurity potential @xmath15 with a self - energy @xmath54 . the self - consistent equation for the self - energy in the cpa is@xcite @xmath55 where the on - site potential is distributed randomly according to the distribution @xmath56 , for which we use the box - distribution as described in section [ ssec - model ] .",
    "the disorder - averaged local green s function is @xmath57 where , for a tight - binding lattice @xmath58 is the dispersion of the lattice .",
    "equation ( [ cpa ] ) is a statement that when averaged over the effective disorder potential @xmath59 the t - matrix vanishes .",
    "we construct @xmath0 from the cpa results using the following simple approach : we find the ldos for a site embedded in an effective medium characterized by the cpa self - energy @xmath54 , where @xmath54 is determined from eq .",

    "note that if we take the arithmetic average instead we simply recovered the cpa dos , ie .",

    "while the cpa reproduces the exact @xmath45 accurately , there is a significant discrepancy between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , presumably because the cpa does not capture the quantum interference to which the ldos and hence gados are sensitive .",

    "a sketch is given within some frequency window of the dos ( for the whole system ) and the ldos at two well - separated sites @xmath86 and @xmath80 .",

    "presenting our results , we begin with the case of a one dimensional chain , which is useful for several reasons .",
    "first , it is simple : there is no anderson transition .",
    "all states are strongly localized for any nonzero @xmath24 , with @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mean free path .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the limits @xmath89 and @xmath90 are both accessible in numerical computations .",
    "finally , the fact that we can study instances of localization with @xmath24 less than the bandwidth allows us to distinguish two distinct factors which cause a decline in the gados  exponential tails of localized eigenstates and small wavefunction amplitudes at sites of extreme potential .",
    "[ fig_3 ] demonstrates how the ipr shows localization in this @xmath33 case . in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ( a ) , there is a clear crossover from @xmath91 to @xmath86 roughly constant at @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding energy - dependent localization lengths are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ( b ) .",
    "the localization lengths have been extracted by fitting the ipr to a form @xmath93 which we expect for one - dimensional wavefunctions that are decaying exponentially over a length scale @xmath2 with periodic boundary conditions . because @xmath94 saturates for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",
    "the values of @xmath98 determined in this way are quantitatively consistent with earlier calculations,@xcite and are also close to the quantity @xmath99 that is frequently taken as a definition of the localization length",
    ". the quantitative differences between the two definitions are not important for this work .",
    "rather , the main point of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] is to establish that the @xmath33 results presented below are for the strongly - localized regime @xmath100 , where we expect @xmath0 to be strongly influenced by the exponential tails of the wavefunctions .",
    "[ fig_4 ] shows the variation of the gados at the band center as a function of disorder strength for a finite size system .",
    "results from the enc are shown for several values of the energy bin widths including @xmath42 , and the cpa result is also shown .",
    "navely , there appears to be an anderson transition at nonzero @xmath24 . if it were to be assumed that the anderson transition occurs when @xmath101 with @xmath102 , then @xmath0 erroneously predicts an anderson transition at a _ nonzero _ critical disorder @xmath103 , where @xmath103 is strongly @xmath36 dependent",
    "this happens for two reasons : first , when @xmath104 , the discrete nature of the ldos is hidden , and moreover when @xmath105 even exponentially localized states have significant amplitude at all sites .",
    "the resulting potential for errors points both to the importance of performing a proper scaling analysis and also to the significance of @xmath36 in the scaling , a feature key to the applicability of this method in many - body calculations .",
    "we remark that the @xmath36 dependence of @xmath0 at small values of @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] is a finite size effect due to the varying number of discrete states which fall in each energy bin [ see eq .",
    "( [ ldosgamma ] ) ] .",
    "this issue does not arise when @xmath24 is large because in this case the eigenvalues shift significantly from one disorder configuration to the next and hence the number which fall in any given energy bin is stabilized by sample averaging .",
    "equivalently , finite size effects appear for small @xmath24 because the mean free path is larger than the system size .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] , we examine the scaling behavior of @xmath0 .",

    "figure  [ fig_5](a ) shows the scaling of @xmath107 with chain length for @xmath108 and several values of @xmath36 including zero . at this disorder strength , @xmath109 lattice spacings and @xmath110 . for @xmath42 and @xmath90 ,",

    "saturates at larger values of @xmath32 .",
    "we make the ansatz that there is an effective system size dominated by the shorter of the two relevant lengths : @xmath113 where @xmath114 , such that @xmath115 . in fig .",

    "[ fig_5](a ) versus @xmath116 shows that the ansatz works well .",
    "one immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) is that when @xmath117 , @xmath107 saturates at @xmath118 .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ fig_4 ] , the apparent critical disorder @xmath103 actually marks the crossover from @xmath119 to @xmath120 rather than a localization transition .",
    "we conclude that the scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath28 can be used to place an upper bound on the disorder strength at which localization occurs : if an exponential decay of @xmath107 with increasing @xmath28 is seen , then localization is occurring .",
    "however , if @xmath36 is too large , the effect will be masked .",
    "essentially this analysis may lead to false negatives but not to false positives , and in particular the true result is approached as @xmath121 .",

    "unlike in the @xmath33 case , they are similar to the cpa result , a point discussed further in section [ ssec - rnd - infinite ] .",
    "the weak disorder results are included in the inset and show strong @xmath36 dependence for the same reasons discussed in the @xmath33 case .",
    "again , the correct approach is a scaling analysis .",
    "[ fig_7 ] ( a ) shows the logarithm of the gados versus the system size @xmath32 ( @xmath122 ) using @xmath42 , and fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] ( b ) shows the same quantity for a nonzero energy bin width . from these plots it is easy to distinguish localized from delocalized behavior , at least outside of the critical regime @xmath106 . in the delocalized phase",

    "this is consistent with the log - normal distribution of the ldos predicted by mirlin , @xcite and furthermore the decline in the value of @xmath107 with increasing @xmath24 is consistent with a decrease in the position of the maximum of the distribution as the transition is approached , also predicted by mirlin .",
    "@xcite in the localized phase , the exponential decay as well as the saturation for @xmath43 are similar to what is seen in one dimension",
    ". the larger error bars on the @xmath42 , @xmath126 results are related to the proximity to the transition : the mobility edges are very close to @xmath14 and hence the energy window used in generating @xmath127 must be especially narrow to avoid including localized states outside the mobility edge .",
    "the reduction in the number of states included leads to noisier results .    in one dimension , we showed that the strong dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath36 can be understood in terms of an effective length @xmath116 .",
    "we find this to be true for @xmath1 as well .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig_7](b ) shows that for the strongly - localized phase ( @xmath128 ) , the data for @xmath42 and @xmath129 collapse onto a single curve when plotted against @xmath116 [ eq .",

    "we remark that for @xmath129 , @xmath130 lattice constants .",
    "since @xmath131 , this means that even for a large range of @xmath32 , the effective range sampled by scaling is quite small .",
    "in particular , if this re - scaling of lengths applies to the critical regime , this implies that the determination of the mobility edges by scaling analysis may be severly limited in , for example , many - body calculations which are performed at complex frequencies @xmath132 .    finally , fig .",

    "the scaling of @xmath0 with system size could also be used to produce a phase diagram , and the transition would always lie on the high @xmath24 side of the ipr line , with the two coinciding in the limit @xmath136 .",
    "however , the construction of such a diagram is similarly computationally intensive to the equivalent ipr calculation and in an interacting system offers no obvious advantages .",
    "we now turn our attention to infinite systems .",
    "recent dmft work @xcite includes plots similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , showing the gados declining as a function of @xmath24 . here , we point out that factors other than exponentially decaying tails of localized states may lead to a decline ( although not a zero ) in the gados .",
    "the gados is very sensitive to small values of the ldos on individual sites .",
