    "<S> using a multi - conduction - channel model , we redefined the micromechanism of spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) . </S>",
    "<S> four conduction channels are created by spin accumulation of nonpolarized electron flow at top , bottom , left and right interfaces of the film sample , which corresponds to different resistance states of polarized electron flow with various spin directions relative to the applied magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , and brings about the smr effect finally . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic insulator layer , such as yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) , is not a requisite for the observation of smr . instead , the smr effect is perfectly realized , with an order of magnitude increase , in the sample with a discontinuous layer of isolated - co@xmath1feal ( 0.3 nm ) grains covered by 2.5-nm - thick pt layer on mgo substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the model intuitively gives the typical relationship of smr effect , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are longitudinal reisitivities with applied magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) direction perpendicular to the current direction out of plane ( as z direction ) , parallel with and perpendicular to it in plane ( as x and y direction ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our research reveals that the scattering between polarized and nonpolarized conduction electrons is the origin of smr , and the intrinsic smr is not constant when @xmath0 direction rotates in xz plane , which is distinct from that in the reported smr mechanism .    since the magnetic transport property of pt grown on yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) </S>",
    "<S> was reported two years ago  @xcite , the drastic controversy on the understanding of its origin continues today . on the beginning , </S>",
    "<S> the strong ferromagnetic characteristics in pt films on yig are considered as a consequence of static magnetic proximity effect ( mpe )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> soon , nakayama _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. excluded the contribution of static magnetic proximity effect through an inserted 6-nm - thick cu layer between pt and yig , where the magnetic transport property of yig / cu / pt film persists although it turns much weak  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they pointed out that the magnetic transport property of pt / yig is actually induced by spin hall effect and meantime suggested a new magnetoresistance ( mr ) phenomenon , i.e. spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , lu y. m. _ et al_. insist on the mpe by a series of experiments on yig / pt and pt / permalloy / pt fims  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they found @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are longitudinal reisitivities with applied magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) direction perpendicular to the current direction out of plane ( as z direction ) , parallel with and perpendicular to it in plane ( as x and y direction ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is distinctly different from all other known mr effects including the smr , and termed the new mr as hybrid mr . </S>",
    "<S> immediately , the proposal of hybrid mr caused a more intense argument  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to understand the nature of mr in yig / pt films , lin t. _ et al_.  @xcite and miao b. f. _ et al_.  @xcite suggested two compromised solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the former appraises that the smr plays a main role at high temperature and mpe gradually manifests itself with decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the latter believes that the smr dominates at low magnetic field , while mpe at high field . in review all these arguments </S>",
    "<S> , we found all viewpoints , to some degree , has its reasonable and unreasonable aspects . </S>",
    "<S> however , _ </S>",
    "<S> numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate _ , as occam had said hundreds years ago , there might be a model to comprehend all experimental results simply . </S>",
    "<S> under this consideration , we therefore redefined the smr in this work .            </S>",
    "<S> when a nonpolarized electron flow passes through a conductor , a transverse pure spin current will be generated due to the spin orbit coupling ( soc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current density can be read as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spin hall angle , @xmath8 represents the spin , @xmath9 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath10 is the electronic charge , and @xmath11 is the electron flow density  @xcite . in a cylindrical wire </S>",
    "<S> the spins wind around the surface . for a wire with rectangular cross - section like the commonest thin film sample , </S>",
    "<S> spins are accumulated at opposite interfaces with opposite spin directions , as shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 . on the discussion about yig / pt system up to now , </S>",
    "<S> spin accumulation at top and bottom interfaces , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , is considered as the only reason to trigger the smr . </S>",
    "<S> hereinto , the magnetization direction of magnetic insulator layer ( e.g. yig ) parallel with and perpendicular to accumulated spins at yig / pt interface in xy plane , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are deemed to be two maximum states of spin scattering and spin absorption , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance of pt film can therefore be tuned by @xmath14 under the interaction of inverse she , causing the smr effect . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of spin accumulation at left and right interfaces shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) was neglected in the smr . </S>",
    "<S> being the most important conclusion from this physical image of the smr , magnetoresistance must remain constant when @xmath14 is rotating in xz plane , because @xmath14 has no transverse component . on the other hand , the magnetic insulator layer seems to be indispensable for the observation of smr . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why so many studies on the smr have chosen yig , fe@xmath15o@xmath16 and cofe@xmath1o@xmath16 as the bottom layer  @xcite .    if spin splitting occurs in the z direction , the spin accumulation described in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) becomes a well - known spin transport phenomenon , anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) . </S>",
    "<S> countless studies of the ahe have already proved the significant existence of the spin accumulation at the left and right interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we hardly believe it could totally be missing in the smr effect and thus we take it back in our model . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) exhibits the coordinate system for the smr measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the yellow arrow ( @xmath17 ) indicates the electron flow direction . </S>",
    "<S> the red arrow ( @xmath14 ) indicates @xmath0 direction and it is also the direction of saturation magnetic moment if @xmath0 is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> the gray arrow is the z direction . @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represent rotation angles of @xmath0 in different planes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when an electron flow is passing through a normal metal layer deposited on a magnetic layer , partial conduction electrons can be polarized with the spin direction along @xmath14 direction by means of spin transfer torque , spin filtering and magnon - spin angle moment transfer etc .  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 could be separated into polarized ( @xmath21 ) and nonpolarized ( @xmath22 ) parts . </S>",
    "<S> still , spin accumulation will arise due to @xmath22 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile the polarized conduction electrons marked as @xmath14 direction at the center of every image in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , incline to move to a preferred direction in the light of she . if we consider the four spin accumulation interfaces as four preferred spin channels , the physical image indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) are then greatly similar to the typical dual - conduction - channel model of current in plane giant magnetoresistance ( cipgmr )  @xcite . here , if the spin direction of an electron is parallel to the spin direction of one channel , it is easy for the electron to pass through this channel . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> antiparallel configuration means strong scattering . </S>",
    "<S> perpendicular configuration means that the spin has projections in both parallel and antiparallel directions , which leads to middle - level electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for a film sample , usually its width ( w ) is much larger than its thickness ( t ) , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> most conduction electrons with spin in z direction can hardly approach the left and right channels . </S>",
    "<S> oppositely , those conduction electrons with spin in y direction can easily access the top and bottom channels since the spin diffusion length is usually larger than t. therefore , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) intuitively gives the typical relationship @xmath24 in the smr effect . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) presents equivalent circuits for the above analysis .    for * m * in xy plane </S>",
    "<S> , the resistivity tensor can be written as ( details see appendix a ) @xmath25    here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are longitudinal resistivities , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are transverse resistivities , respectively , when @xmath18 = 0 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we make @xmath28 = @xmath29 = @xmath31 because they are usually minuteness . for arbitrary @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> using unitary transformation we get @xmath32  @xcite , where @xmath33 is the rotation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> then the longitudinal resistivity in new coordinate system can be simply read as , @xmath34 using our model , we get the same expression of the smr on @xmath18 as that in reference  @xcite . changing @xmath18 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we can also obtain @xmath35 therefore our expressions satisfy all rotation angles . </S>",
    "<S> this is distinctly different from the reported smr mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> once the physical image of the smr is clarified , we found that the magnetic insulator layer such as the yig is not a requisite for the observation of smr . </S>",
    "<S> the role of magnetic insulator layer is just for spin polarization of conduction electrons , and it actually works in a low efficiency manner . we therefore employ discontinuous magnetic metal layer to substitute for the magnetic insulator layer in this research . </S>",
    "<S> two samples , co@xmath1feal ( 0.3 nm)/pt ( 2.5 nm ) and co@xmath1feal ( 0.6 nm)/pt ( 2.5 nm ) , were prepared with hall bar mask on mgo substrates by dc sputtering at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the base pressure is @xmath36 pa . the thicker sample was annealed at @xmath37c _ in situ_. magnetic transport properties of samples were measured by a physical property measurement system ( ppms ) . </S>",
    "<S> ultrathin co@xmath1feal film can not grow on mgo substrate uniformly , and thus it is insulating until the thickness is over 1.1 nm . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows schematic morphology of co@xmath1feal / pt sample , where the isolated co@xmath1feal grains are enwrapped by the pt layer . when conduction electrons pass through co@xmath1feal grains , </S>",
    "<S> partial electrons will be polarized along @xmath14 direction because of angle moment exchanging . </S>",
    "<S> after that the polarized electrons move to the preferred channel under the influence of she .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig 3 ] shows classic smr results of co@xmath1feal ( 0.3 nm)/pt ( 2.5 nm ) film under 5 t magnetic field at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 = @xmath39 for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 = @xmath40 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this figure , the dependency of @xmath20 is almost flat , which is thought as the most important evidence for the smr based on the theory raised in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . however , it is still a function of @xmath41 as @xmath42 according to our model . </S>",
    "<S> it looks flat just because @xmath43 , which is resulting from dimension effect as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig 2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weak ( cosine)@xmath44 relationship is observed not only in our experiment , but also in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . even in the first report of the smr </S>",
    "<S> , the relationship had appeared in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(e ) if one reads the data carefully  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since we use much more efficient method for spin polarization of conduction electrons and the thinner pt layer , the smr effect is drastically enhanced and it is at least one order larger than those reported previously . these results </S>",
    "<S> strongly support our understanding on the smr . </S>",
    "<S> it is more important that larger effect may find it easier in possible applications .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath4 deviates from @xmath3 , the @xmath45 dependence would become more distinct . </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways to enlarge the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , our micromechanism of the smr is based on the she as usual . </S>",
    "<S> the soc can be enhanced and the spin diffusion length can be elongated at low temperature , which leads to intensive spin accumulation and makes more polarized electrons with spin along y and z directions accessing the channels . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spin along x direction is always perpendicular to channels preferred spin directions , the related electrons are still difficult to enter the channels and thus @xmath4 may change little . with the same reason , </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath46 may also reduce @xmath3 , since more electrons with spin along z direction can access left and right channels . on account of these deduction , the experimental results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 can be understood . in both subgraphs of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig 4 ] , the ( cosine)@xmath44 relationships of @xmath20 are clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> note that in some group , they consider ( cosine)@xmath44 relationships of @xmath20 stem from anisotropy magnetoresistance ( amr )  @xcite , because they adopted the former smr model . </S>",
    "<S> we believe there is no amr contribution at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , with increasing thickness of co@xmath1feal layer , amr will dominate magnetoresistance behavior finally .    </S>",
    "<S> the smr effect is a fascinating conception . </S>",
    "<S> it is significant to study the related spin transport behavior and application in spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical image of the smr was not clear in previous studies . here </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a model enlightened by the dual - conduction - channel mode of cipgmr , where the smr stems from the scattering between polarized and nonpolarized conduction electrons under she , rather than the interaction between the accumulated spins and the magnetization of magnetic insulator layer . according to our model </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 comes from dimension effect . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic insulator layer , such as yig , is actually a kind of bad buffer layer for the observation of smr . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , when @xmath0 rotates in xz plane , the smr effect still follows ( cosine)@xmath44 relationship . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , some reported results which are thought as the amr are actually the smr too . </S>",
    "<S> this research may help to build a precise theory on the smr effect .    </S>",
