    "( [ eq ] ) have been initially introduced under name _ magnetic vortices _",
    "@xcite because , to a certain extent , they are similar to 2d topogical defects investigated in magnetism and known as `` two - dimensional topological solitons '' or `` vortices '' ( e.g. well - known belavin - polyakov solutions for magnetic vortices @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the term _ skyrmion _ has been conceived in a field rather distant from condensed - matter physics and initially was related to the localized solutions derived by skyrme within his model for low - energy dynamics of mesons and baryons @xcite .",
    "in fact , the skyrme model @xcite comprises three spatial dimensions , and the name `` baby skyrmion '' was used by some field theorists to distinguish two - dimensional localized states from `` mature '' three - dimensional solutions in the original skyrme model @xcite , both types of them being topological static solitons . during the last decades the `` skyrmion '' has progressively won currency in general physics to designate _ any _ non - singular localized and topologically stable field configuration . complying with this trend , in 2002",
    "we have renamed `` chiral magnetic vortices '' into `` chiral skyrmions '' @xcite .",
    "ironically , the fate of the localized states near ordering transition , as they can decay by longitudinal magnetization processes , betrays that these `` chiral skyrmions '' are not topologically stable , at high enough temperature .",
    "thus , the term _ skyrmion _ is an umbrella title for smooth localized structures to distinguish them from singular localized states , e.g. , disclinations in liquid crystal textures @xcite .",
    "this convention provides only a formal _ label _ for a large variety of very different solitonic states from many fields of physics @xcite . with respect to the subject of this paper",
    "a `` skyrmion '' designates well - defined solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) which are * ( i ) localized * , * ( ii ) axisymmetric * , and have * ( iii ) fixed rotation sense*. examples of chiral skyrmions have been presented in figs .",
    "[ skyrmion ] , [ uniaxial0 ] .",
    "the axisymmetric structure of the skyrmion core and its localized character are retained in bound states as skyrmion lattices @xcite .",
    "this reflects the particle - like character of chiral skyrmions and the most general features of their energetics ( fig .",
    "[ uniaxial0 ] ( a ) , and refs .",
    "skyrmions as countable entities can be arranged in various ways to create dense magnetic textures .",
    "this is the essence of skyrmionic matter and entails the possibility to form a variety of mesophases with crystalline , but also with liquid - like or glassy large - scale structure in chiral magnetism .",
    "alternative approaches construct skyrmionic textures from crossing plane waves ( helices ) as fundamental modes of so - called spin - spiral crystals @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a skyrmion lattice is composed of three helices superimposed under an angle of 120 degree . according to @xcite such a `` triple - q antiskyrmion lattice '' ansatz even reaches the global free energy minimum in the a phase of mnsi .",
    "this construction is inconsistent with the properties of skyrmions .",
    "chiral skyrmionic textures incorporate isolated or embedded axisymmetric lines .",
    "the notions of a `` spin - spiral crystal '' @xcite or `` multi - q skyrmions '' @xcite are misconceptions because they blend mutually exclusive ideas of particle - like localized skyrmions from one side and delocalized plane waves from the other .",
    "the radial structure of the chiral skyrmion can not be reduced to a superposition of harmonic helical waves .",
    "calculations based on such multi - q ansaetze predict incorrect phase diagrams .",
    "e.g. , the hexagonal skyrmion lattice is stable in remanent state at @xmath149 @xcite , but in @xcite an instability at a finite field is presented for the variational hexagonal spin - spiral solution .",
    "the idea of a spin - spiral crystal ruled by one harmonic mode , where contributions of higher - order modes are small in some sense @xcite , also is at variance with the nucleation type of transition actually observed in the chiral skyrmion textures .",
    "this idea wrongly places the dzyaloshinskii theory in a class of models for modulated states with instability type of transitions .",
    "in non - centrosymmetric magnets chiral magnetic skyrmions arise as a result of the specific stabilization mechanism imposed by the handedness of the underlying crystal structure @xcite . in centrosymmetric magnets",
    "such solutions are radially unstable and collapse spontaneously under the influence of the applied magnetic field or intrinsic short - range interactions . in nonlinear field models skyrmion states",
    "can be stabilized by higher order spatial derivatives ( often this is refered to _ skyrme mechanism _ ) . in condensed - matter systems",
    "there are no physical interactions providing such energy contributions . _ chiral interactions _ present a unique mechanism to stabilize skyrmion states in ordered condensed - matter systems .",
    "this singles out chiral systems ( including non - centrosymmetric magnets , multiferroics , liquid crystals , and metallic nanostructures with induced chiral interactions ) into a particular class of materials with skyrmionic states .",
