    "one difficulty that one may imagine is that the algorithm converges to a local minimum of the energy landscape . in this case",
    "a local update is not capable of improving the energy .",
    "this possibility is made unlikely by the fact that for all phases we ran the algorithm multiple times with different random initial configurations and observed that the system always converged to the same phase .    in order to discover the groundstate configurations , the algorithm was applied to a spin system with @xmath41 unit cells ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath42 triangular spins and @xmath43 honeycomb spins ) with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the results of the simulation were highly converged such that the energy per spin that emerged from the simulation numerically coincided exactly with the energy computed by minimization of the variational state .",
    "similarly , the spin configurations ( e.g. scalar products between neighboring spins ) of all the simulated phases were to many digits identical to those of the phases proposed . in the few cases where the convergence was not so good , which was evidenced by the higher energy per spin value , we investigated snapshots of the spin configurations and found that the algorithm had been trapped in a local minimum with topological defects that could not be removed by local updates .",

    "a phase transition occurs at a crossing of the energies of two different spin configurations .",
    "exactly at the transition point , their energies match , but their ( higher order ) derivatives will generally not be the same . according to the usual ehrenfest classification of phase transitions , the order of the phase transition",
    "is determined by the lowest order of the derivative of the ground state energy @xmath69 with respect to the tuning parameter , @xmath67 or @xmath68 , that exhibits a singularity . in the phase diagram",
    "we have indicated the order of the phase transition by the labels @xmath70 and @xmath71 for first and second order phase transitions .",

    "the requirement that these energies should coincide at a point @xmath76 is expressed by the conditions @xmath77 which can be expected to be a solvable system in @xmath67 and @xmath68 , since the number of variables equals the number of conditions . equating a larger number of energy functions will generally result in an overdetermined , unsolvable system , unless the energy functions are related to each other in a special way .",

    "[ fig:2 ] there are , however , seven phases coinciding at the point @xmath78 and four phases coinciding at the point @xmath79 .",

    "the nearest - neighbor spin couplings are determined by the tunneling amplitudes of atoms that move between the different laser field minima . for normal quantum mechanical tunneling between the sites ,",
    "the corresponding spin interaction is always ferromagnetic , favoring a locking of the condensate phases to the same value . in contrast",

    "we note that a coplanar state that minimizes the energy for heisenberg spins has to minimize the energy for xy spins , as well .",

    "these regions are now largely occupied by two new planar phases , ( xy i ) and ( xy ii ) , which we describe below .",
    "of the two highly degenerate points in the phase diagram of the heisenberg model , only one remains in the planar model : at the point @xmath73 six phases meet .",
    "like in the case of the heisenberg model , this high degeneracy is explained by the fact that all six phases deform into either phase @xmath80 or phase @xmath81 in the limit @xmath92 .",

    "we can express the angles in terms of @xmath147 and @xmath146 as @xmath165 by inserting these parameters back into the expression for the energy , we find the energy in explicit form as a function of the coupling constants :      the necessary condition for the existence of this phase is that the coupling constants are such that all three quantities @xmath167 are real . as a first condition we have @xmath168 in order to make the square root expression in @xmath169 and @xmath95 real .",
    "the requirement that @xmath87 be real translates into @xmath170 from the form of @xmath147 and @xmath146 in terms of the coupling constants it is straightforward to show that @xmath171 . with this",
    "the inequality ( [ ineqph4 ] ) results in the final requirement @xmath172 there are no further conditions , since @xmath107 is guaranteed to be real if @xmath87 is .",
    "we return to the case @xmath144 , which is also one of the solutions of eqs .  - with @xmath173 the energy in terms of the coupling constants has a simpler form @xmath174 this is the other double cone phase that we have denoted @xmath63 in the phase diagram .",
    "the necessary condition for this phase to exist , which follows from the requirement that @xmath87 must be real , is @xmath175      we calculate the energy with the spiral angle @xmath95 as a variational parameter .",
    "the variational expression for the energy is @xmath176 we minimize with respect to @xmath95 and obtain @xmath177 as minimizing angle and energy .",
    "since @xmath95 must be real , it follows that @xmath178 must hold for the existence of the spiral phase .",
    "this phase is related to phase ( 4a ) and the minimization problem may be solved in close analogy with it .",
    "the energy is given in terms of the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath107 : @xmath182\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the minimization conditions are given by @xmath183 these equations are solved by @xmath184 the positive sign of @xmath146 leads to a solution with an energy that is always larger than that of the other planar phases .",
    "hence we will disregard this configuration and only focus on the negative sign solution @xmath185 ( and drop the subscript on @xmath146 ) . as a first condition we require that the expression under the square root in the formula for @xmath146 must not be negative .",
    "this is easily shown to be satisfied in exactly two disjoint regions of parameter space @xmath186 furthermore , we require , as we did for phase @xmath62 , that @xmath87 is real .",

    "this condition will hold if either one of the two inequalities @xmath187 is satisfied . from the form of @xmath146 and @xmath147 in terms of the coupling constants",
