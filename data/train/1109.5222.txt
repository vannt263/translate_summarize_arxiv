    "multi - access channel ( mac ) is an important channel model that finds many applications in wireless networks and has drawn substantial research attention in the literature .",
    "traditionally the study of mac is guided under two different philosophies .",
    "information theoretic approach assumes users have a full buffer all the time and strives to characterize the fundamental limits of transmission rates by focusing on the interplay of noise and interference @xcite@xcite .",
    "in contrast , network oriented studies usually focus on addressing issues arising from bursty packet arrivals and view the multi - user channel as a collection of single user channels by adopting a collision model @xcite , treating interference as noise or orthogonalization in time or frequency domain .",
    "the discrepancy between these two lines of work has been well documented in @xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use information theoretic tools to study a problem , which deviates from the usual information theoretic setup and has a flavor of network theory , namely the completion time in multi - access channel .",
    "the completion time problem attempts to incorporate the notion of delay into the information theoretic study of mac .",
    "this paper considers a periodic source arrival model , where a new block of data arrives very @xmath0 channel uses .",
    "hence during each block of @xmath0 channel uses , user s data buffer is not to be replenished and the usual full - buffer assumption is no longer valid .",
    "one example of this would be users sending large files of fixed sizes , in which case we only have a single channel block . for another example ,",
    "consider two users streaming live videos that are compressed at possibly different but fixed rates to a common receiver .",
    "the data arrives periodically . in the beginning of each period",
    ", each user has a certain number of bits to send .",
    "however due to the casuality constraint , after the completion of the current transmission , users will have to wait until the next period to obtain new data to send .",
    "we model this as the follows : user @xmath1 , @xmath2 , has @xmath3 bits , with @xmath3 corresponding to the file size in the file example and @xmath4 corresponding to the compression rate in the streaming example , to transmit in at most @xmath0 channel uses , where @xmath0 is assumed to be large enough to allow the completion of both transmissions .",
    "let @xmath5 be the actual number of channel uses that user @xmath1 spends on the transmission .",
    "we are interested in the _ normalized completion time _",
    "( hereafter referred as `` completion time '' ) within a single channel block , which is defined as @xmath6 in the limit of large @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that in the streaming example , @xmath8 corresponds to the number of source samples , which is assumed to be the same for both users .",
    "in general we can view @xmath8 as a scaling factor to ensure information theoretic arguments with large block lengths can be invoked .",
    "the exact value of @xmath8 is not important since it will not appear in the characterization of completion time .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are an information theoretic formulation of completion time and the derivation of the completion time region for two - user gaussian multi - access channel ( gmac ) , which , analogous to capacity region , characterizes all possible trade - offs between users completion times .",
    "compared with @xcite , where the authors solved the sum completion time minimization problem for a @xmath9-user symmetric gmac , our result provides a more general formulation for the two - user case . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered an interference channel where each user has backlogged packets of equal size to transmit and the goal is to leverage power control to minimize some convex cost function over the completion time region . in @xcite , the completion time region",
    "is obtained by treating interference as noise , whereas in this paper , we adopt an information theoretic approach without restricting ourselves to any specific coding scheme such as treating interference as noise .",
    "this paper is organized as the follows . in section",
    "ii , the concept of constrained rates is introduced , based on which completion time is then defined . in section iii , the completion time region for two - user gmac is derived .",
    "applications of the obtained completion time region and extensions of this work are discussed in section iv .",
    "_ notation _ : let @xmath10 .",
    "also let @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 does not appear if @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16^+=\\max\\{x,0\\}$ ] .",
    "we use bold font for vectors and calligraphic font for regions .",
    "in information theory , it is commonly assumed that a user s data buffer is always full and therefore the goal is to devise a coding scheme that can reliably transmit as much information as possible in a given number of channel uses .",
    "however , in our setup , the total amount of information to be transmitted for user @xmath1 is limited to @xmath3 bits in at most @xmath0 channel uses . hence having some users finish early",
    "is not only desirable to reduce to completion time of those users , but also preferable for the remaining users since they can enjoy reduced multi - user interference in the remaining period . in order to capture this , and to formulate the completion time problem",
    ", we will define communication rates over different number of channel uses for each user , as opposed to the standard definition in multi - user information theory , where users codewords span the same block length .",
    "we refer this as _ constrained rate _ , which will be first defined through a two - user discrete memoryless multi - access channel ( dmmac ) in subsection ii.a .",
    "we then give a formal definition of completion time in subsection ii.b .",
    "consider a two - user dmmac @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the input alphabets , @xmath19 is the channel output alphabet and @xmath20 is the channel transition probability .",
    "let us denote @xmath21 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we will let @xmath23 and @xmath24 vary with @xmath25 fixed . for @xmath2 , @xmath26 . also let @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "one can view @xmath29 as the symbol that `` opens '' up the channel from user @xmath1 to the receiver the most .",
    "a @xmath30 code consists of message sets : @xmath31 , two encoding functions , @xmath32 and two decoding functions @xmath33 note that user @xmath1 will send @xmath34 during the @xmath35 symbols at the end of its codeword .",
    "users independently choose an index @xmath36 uniformly from @xmath37 and send the corresponding codewords .",
    "the average error probability for the @xmath30 code is @xmath38    for a @xmath30 code , the _ @xmath25-constrained rates _ are defined as , for @xmath2 , @xmath39    the @xmath25-constrained rate pair @xmath40 is said to be _ achievable _ if there exists a sequence of @xmath30 codes with @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "the _ c - constrained rate region _ , denoted by @xmath43 , is the set of achievable @xmath25-constrained rate pairs for a given coding scheme .",
    "the _ c - constrained capacity region _",
    "@xmath44 is the closure of all @xmath43 .",
    "we use the term `` @xmath25-constrained rate ( capacity ) region '' to emphasize the fact that user @xmath1 s effective codeword length is constrained by @xmath7 channel uses over which @xmath45 is defined ( the remaining channel uses are padded by @xmath34 ) and the rate ( capacity ) region is a function of @xmath22 .",
    "hence @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the standard rate ( capacity ) region , where @xmath48 .",

    "hereafter we use lower - case @xmath71 and upper - case @xmath72 to refer to the standard and constrained rates respectively .",
    "the proof is relegated to appendix [ proofmaccapacity ] .",
    "now let us consider the following two - user gmac : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noise process and inputs are subject to per symbol power constraints : @xmath75\\leq p_i$ ] .",
    "the standard capacity region of two - user gmac is @xmath76 to avoid confusion , hereafter we use lower - case @xmath71 and upper - case @xmath72 to refer to the standard and constrained rates respectively .",
    "note that for the gmac , @xmath77 , i.e. user @xmath1 stays silent after it completes the transmission in @xmath7 channel uses .

    "the proof mostly follows from theorem [ maccapacity ] .",
    "the achievability is obtained by using gaussian input distribution .",
    "substituting @xmath86 for @xmath47 and @xmath87 for @xmath64 in theorem [ maccapacity ] , the above expression can be derived after some manipulation .",
    "the converse follows from the converse of theorem [ maccapacity ] and the fact that ( [ macr15 ] ) , ( [ macr22 ] ) , ( [ macrss ] ) and @xmath64 are maximized by gaussian input distribution under the per symbol power constraints : @xmath75\\leq p_i$ ] .",

    "[ delaydef ] we define the _ normalized completion time _ as @xmath88 , where @xmath7 is the actual number of channel uses that user @xmath1 spends on transmitting @xmath3 bits .",
    "because of the relation @xmath89 in ( [ ratedef ] ) , where @xmath45 is the @xmath25-constrained rate , we have @xmath90 .",
    "completion time pair @xmath91 is said to be _ achievable _ if @xmath92 is an achievable @xmath25-constrained rate pair , i.e. @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the achievable completion time region for a given coding scheme is @xmath95 .",
    "analogous to capacity region , we can also define the overall completion time region @xmath96 as the union of all achievable completion time regions , or equivalently @xmath97 .",
    "in this section , we establish properties of @xmath96 and compute it for two - user gmac . notice that an achievable completion time pair @xmath91 is defined in terms of @xmath25-constrained rate pair , which in return depends on @xmath91 through @xmath98 .",
    "hence it is easy to check for a given @xmath91 whether or not it is achievable , but difficult to directly compute all pairs of @xmath99 using the definition because of this recursive dependence .",
    "another difficulty in determining @xmath96 is that it is not always convex , as we shall show later in theorem [ ctr ] . to walk around these obstacles , we characterize two sub - regions of @xmath96",
    "seperately and the union of the two will lead us to @xmath96 . in subsection iii.a , we first show that the sub - regions are always convex . in subsection iii.b",
    ", we consider the weighted sum completion time minimization problem over the sub - regions for two - user gmac , which will be used in subsection iii.c to show the achievability and converse when we establish the sub - regions and hence @xmath96 .",

    "we consider the transmission scheme pictorially depicted in fig [ timesharing].a . in the first @xmath111 channel uses ,",
    "the two users employ some coding scheme , denoted by @xmath112 , where proper decoding is required at the end of @xmath23 channel uses to ensure messages sent in this time interval are received correctly . in the remaining @xmath113 channel uses , coding scheme @xmath114 is employed at user 2 while user 1 sends @xmath115 .",
    "the decoding for this part of user 2 s message is done at the end of @xmath116 channel uses .",
    "note that by theorem [ maccapacity ] and lemma [ raterelation ] , we can view user 2 s message consisting of two independent parts for @xmath23 and @xmath116 channel uses respectively . similarly for @xmath117 , we consider coding schemes @xmath118 and @xmath119 shown in fig [ timesharing].b . based on the coding schemes for @xmath120 and @xmath117",
    ", we construct a new coding scheme , depicted in fig [ timesharing].c .",
    "since during each sub - interval error probability can be driven arbitrarily small , the overall scheme is reliable .",
    "the completion time achieved by this scheme for user @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is @xmath121 .",

    "this is because , in this case , the codewords in different sub - intervals will not be aligned , as opposed to the case shown in fig [ timesharing].c . , and",
    "thus we can not argue that the decoding in each sub - interval ( hence for the overall transmission scheme ) will be successful .      for the remainder of this paper",

    "the information theoretic formulation of completion time discussed in this paper is based on the concept of constrained rates introduced through a two - user dmmac .",
    "for the special case of gmac , the explicit completion time region is then obtained .",
    "since the gaussianality of the channel does not come into the picture until the explicit formulation of the minimization problem in subsection iii.b , all prior observations , particularly the convexity of sub - regions of the completion time region , also apply to a general mac .",
    "furthermore , it is not difficult to see that the concept of constrained rates is not unique to mac and is applicable to other multi - user channels as well .",

    "<S> in a multi - access channel , completion time refers to the number of channel uses required for users , each with some given fixed bit pool , to complete the transmission of all their data bits . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of the completion time region is based on the concept of constrained rates , where users rates are defined over possibly different number of channel uses . </S>",
    "<S> an information theoretic formulation of completion time is given and the completion time region is then established for two - user gaussian multi - access channel , which , analogous to capacity region , characterizes all possible trade - offs between users completion times . </S>"
