    "according to the canonical formation scenario , millisecond pulsars ( msps ) form in binary systems containing a neutron star ( ns ) eventually spun up to millisecond periods by mass accretion from an evolving companion , that , in turn , is expected to become a white dwarf ( wd ; e.g * ? ? ?",

    "this is partially caused by selection effects , since gcs have been searched very deeply by radio surveys . despite this , the over - abundance of msps in gcs compared to the galactic disk is real and very large , and provides a strong indication that dynamical interactions greatly enhance the formation of these objects .",
    "in fact , in the galactic field the only viable formation channel for msps is the evolution of primordial binaries , while in gcs dynamical interactions can promote the formation of binaries suitable for recycling nss into msps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "despite their importance , only eight msp companions in six gcs have been identified so far @xcite .",

    "`` black widows '' ( bws ) are msps characterized by an unmeasurably small eccentricity and a very small mass function ( thus indicating a companion mass smaller than @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most cases",
    "these pulsars show eclipses in the radio signal suggesting that the companion is a non - degenerate , possibly bloated star . in particular , in some systems the radio eclipse lasts for a significant fraction of the orbit , implying that the eclipsing region at the position of the companion is larger than its roche lobe ( rl ) .",
    "this suggests that the obscuring material is the plasma released by the companion because of the energy injected by the pulsar .",
    "after the discovery of the first bws in gcs , @xcite observed that they represented a much larger fraction of the msp population than in the galactic disk .",
    "because of this , they proposed that bws form much more often than other types of msps in gcs , going even as far as to suggest that perhaps they form _ exclusively _ in gcs and that the bws in the galactic disk were formed in gcs and later ejected .",
    "however , in the last years the number of bws discovered in the galactic field has significantly increased , both in blind surveys @xcite and particularly in the surveys targeted at fermi unidentified sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if this view is correct , then the percentages of bws as a fraction of the total msp population should be similar in the galaxy and in gcs , particularly the gcs with a low interaction rate _ per binary _",
    "@xcite : in both environments , an lmxb , once formed , can evolve undisturbed towards the msp binary stage . some bws should survive even in gcs with a high interaction rate per binary , because they have very small orbits that are unlikely to be disrupted . hence studying the numbers and properties of bws both in the galactic field and in gcs is important to test these two hypotheses ( formation through dynamical interactions or the evolution of primordial binaries ) .",

    "we took observations in search mode , resulting in data with 256 frequency channels per wapp , and a time resolution of 64@xmath16s . in order to avoid known sources of radio frequency interference ( aka rfi ) ,",

( 2008 ) , with a few scattered observations that helped improve the proper motions of all the pulsars . given the short orbital period of m5c",
    ", we get excellent , but quasi - random orbital coverage of this pulsar , since the observing strategy has been mostly designed with m5b in mind .",
    "the data were processed using standard techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with tools in the presto software suite .",
    "we folded the lower and contiguous upper frequency bands modulo the predicted pulse period using prepfold , removed strong narrow - band or transient broad - band rfi as identified by eye from the folds , then averaged the high signal - to - noise detections together to make a template pulse profile .",
    "we determined times of arrival ( toas ) every 3@xmath1715 minutes ( based on the strength of the detection , primarily due to diffractive scintillation ) by cross - correlating the template profile with the folded data using the routine get_toas.py , resulting in 2078 toas covering a period of about 9 years .",
    "we determined a phase - connected timing solution using tempo , by fitting for astrometric , spin , and orbital parameters , along with a single average dispersion measure .",
    "we corrected arrival times to the tt(bipm ) time standard and used the de421 solar system ephemerides @xcite .",
    "only 1398 toas were actually used in the fit as we ignored those toas between orbital phases of 0.2@xmath170.38 due to the regular pulsar eclipse and the pulse delays during eclipse egress which would systematically skew orbital parameter fits .",
    "the eccentricity of the 2.08-hr orbit was too small to measure and we therefore fixed it , as well as the argument of periapsis ( @xmath18 ) , both to zero .",
    "the final timing solution , reported in table  [ tab : timing ] and shown in figure  [ m5cfig : radiores ] , had weighted rms residuals of 12.3@xmath16s and a reduced-@xmath19 of 1.88 with 1385 degrees - of - freedom .",
    "we estimated the errors on the fit parameters using a bootstrap error analysis with 4096 iterations .",
    "the timing solution includes a very precise position and proper motion , which are absolutely required for follow - up of the object in the crowded field of m5 .",

    "this is well within the core radius of the cluster .",
    "the proper motion is entirely consistent with the previously measured proper motions of psr b1516 + 02a and b @xcite , indicating that it is mostly due to the motion of the cluster as a whole .",
    "the peculiar velocities of these pulsars within the cluster are still too small to be measured with our current timing precision .",
    "the observed spin period derivative of the pulsar is a combination of several contributions , the main ones being due to its intrinsic spin period derivative , @xmath25 , the acceleration of the pulsar in the gravitational field of the cluster projected along the line of sight @xmath26 and the shklovskii s effect , due to the pulsar s total proper motion @xmath16 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance to the cluster , 7.5 kpc .",
    "the galactic acceleration is generally small or of the same order as the last term , which is the smallest .    using a simple empirical model of gc interiors @xcite and the cluster s central velocity dispersion of 5.5 km s@xmath29 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* version ) , we estimate that the maximum cluster acceleration along the line of sight at the location of m5c is @xmath30 .",
    "this would need to be of the order of @xmath31 to fully account for the observed @xmath32 already without the contribution from the shklovskii effect ( which amounts to @xmath33 ) . from this",
    ", we can infer minimum and maximum values for @xmath34 of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which implies a magnetic field @xmath37 g and a characteristic age @xmath38 gyr .",
    "these values are typical among the galactic msp population .",
    "we also detect a variation of orbital period with very high significance ; its time derivative @xmath39 is @xmath40 . considering the typical masses of such binary systems",
    "the measured value is one order of magnitude larger than the expected contribution due to the emission of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity .",
    "such a discrepancy is a common feature for bw systems @xcite , where significant changes of the orbit are most likely caused by tidal dissipation leading to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion ( which are not negligible in the case of a distorted companion , or in the presence of an interaction between the companion and the pulsar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the effect is _ not _ due to the acceleration of the pulsar in the cluster : even if it were accelerating with @xmath41 , the contribution to the orbital variation would only be @xmath42 .",
    "we also detect a variation of the apparent slowdown of the pulsar , @xmath43 , although with much lower significance .",
    "this is likely caused by a small change in the gravitational acceleration of the cluster and nearby stars at the position of the pulsar , something to be expected considering that the pulsar is , at least in projection , very near the center of the cluster , where the stellar density is highest .",
    "by taking advantage of the precise position of  obtained from the radio timing , we used high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) images to search for the optical companion to this pulsar .",

    "a moffat function @xcite provides the best fit to the data in all cases .",
    "all f390w , f606w and f814w images have been combined with daophot montage2 in order to produce a master frame . on this combined image",

    "since the fov of the wfc3 images suffers heavily from geometric distortions , we corrected the instrumental positions of stars by applying the equations reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then transformed the wfc3 catalog to the absolute astrometric system ( @xmath48 , @xmath58 ) by using the stars in common with the hst wfpc2 catalog from @xcite as secondary astrometric standards , by using the cross - correlation software cataxcorrpaolo / main / catapack.html _ , has been successfully used in a large number of papers by our group in the past 10 years . ] .",
    "the astrometric solution has an accuracy of @xmath59 in both @xmath48 and @xmath58 .",
    "finally , the wfc3 instrumental magnitudes have been calibrated to the vegamag system by using the photometric zero - points and the procedures reported on the wfc3 web page .      in order to identify the companion to  we searched for peculiar objects located within @xmath60 from the nominal pulsar position ( see table [ tab : timing ] ) .",
    "at a first visual inspection of the pulsar region , it was possible to identify a star showing strong variability and lying at @xmath61 from the pulsar , which is within the optical astrometric uncertainty .",
    "this star is very faint and visible only in a few images , while it is below the detection limit in the other frames ( see figure [ m5cfig : map ] ) .",
    "for this reason we performed a visual inspection of all the 44 available images , whenever possible forcing the fitting procedure to determine the magnitude of this faint star .",
    "we were able to measure its magnitude in only 14 images ( 4 in the f390w , 3 in the f606w and 7 in the f814w filters ) however this limited data set was sufficient to clearly assess the variability of this star , which showed quite significant luminosity variations : @xmath62 mag ( from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 mag ( from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 mag ( from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) . unfortunately , the object is under the detection threshold in all f656n images , hence we do not have any @xmath71 measure . in the other images",
    "this star is not detected , most likely because its flux is below the detection threshold . for each band",
    ", we estimated the detection threshold as the average value of the magnitudes of the five faintest detected stars within 20  from the pulsar position , obtaining @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in turn , these values imply the following lower limits to the amplitudes of variation : @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "moreover this star shows a magnitude scatter larger than that computed for objects of similar luminosity .    in order to establish whether the magnitude of variation is related to the pulsar s orbital phase ( and hence establish a physical connection between this star and the pulsar ) , we computed the light curve in the three bands folding each measurement ( using a magnitude upper limit for the images where the star is not detected ) with the orbital period and the ascending node of the pulsar ( see table [ tab : timing ] ) .",
    "although the available data do not allow a complete coverage of the orbital period , the flux modulation of the star nicely correlates with the pulsar s orbital phase ( see figure [ m5cfig : lc ] ) .",
    "in fact , the data are consistent with a luminosity maximum ( in each band ) around @xmath78 , corresponding to the pulsar inferior conjunction ( when we are observing the companion side facing the pulsar ) and a luminosity minimum ( at least a few magnitudes fainter ) around @xmath79 , corresponding to the pulsar superior conjunction ( when we are observing the back side of the companion ) .",
    "such a shape is the typical light curve expected when the surface of the companion is heated by the pulsar flux .    for reference ,",
    "we over - plotted sinusoidal functions with a maximum at @xmath78 and a minimum at @xmath79 onto the observed light curve . the first important point to note",
    "is that in order to account for most of the upper limits where the star is not detected , an amplitude variation of about three magnitudes is required ( see figure [ m5cfig : lc ] ) .",
    "such a large modulation ( @xmath80mag@xmath81 mags ) is in good agreement with what is observed for similar objects in the galactic field ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , despite the low significance of the detection , there are some hints that the light curve could be asymmetric ( e.g. the decrease to minimum seems to be steeper than the increase to maximum ) , possibly due to an asynchronously rotating companion as in the case of psr j2051@xmath170827 @xcite .    as evident from figure [ m5cfig : map",

    "they are both located in the lowest part of the main sequence and from a variability analysis their light curves appear to be dominated by the large photometric errors . in particular they seem to have different behaviors in the various filters and they do not show any correlation with the orbital motion of the system .",
    "hence , we can safely rule out these objects as possible candidate companions .",
    "all these pieces of evidence suggest that the identified variable star is the companion to  and we name it .",
    "since the available @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 measurements do not allow us to have reliable measures of the mean magnitudes of this star , in the following analysis we will use the values at maxima ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and a plausible range of magnitude variation ( @xmath88 mags ) .",

    "in particular , for the magnitude of the companion we assumed the value at maximum ( @xmath86 ) as an upper limit to the luminosity and for its color we adopted the value at maximum ( @xmath95 ) as a reference . the color uncertainty has been estimated from the typical photometric error of stars of similar magnitudes ( see the gray shaded region in figure [ m5cfig : cmd ] ) .",
    "the resulting effective temperature , luminosity and mass of the companion are @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . given that both the luminosity and temperature of the companion are overestimated , the comparison with the adopted theoretical isochrone gives an upper limit to the companion mass .",
    "note that if we consider the largest derived value of the mass ( @xmath99 ) and we combine it with the pulsar mass function , we can rule out very small inclination angles ( e.g. , @xmath100 for a @xmath101 ns ) .",

    "the latter is consistent with the known proper motion of two other m5 pulsars , indicating that they are all co - moving because of the cluster motion .",
    "we also estimated the time derivative of the orbital period .",
    "as common for bw systems , it is larger than the expected contribution due to the emission of gravitational waves",
    ". it is much more likely due to tidal dissipation .",
    "the precise position of the pulsar was used to identify the companion star ( ) in the optical bands by using high - resolution wfc3/hst images",
    ".  turns out to be a very faint but strongly variable star ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "its location in the cmd in a region between the cluster ms and the wd cooling sequence suggests that it is a low - mass star .",
    "this is the first companion star to a bw ever detected in a gc .",
    "because of its faintness the star was detected only in 14 out of the 44 available images , whose phases nearly correspond to the pulsar inferior conjunction , while it is below the detection limit at the pulsar superior conjunction .",
    "the analysis of the light curve , obtained adopting a simple sinusoidal model , suggests a variation amplitude of about three mags , in good agreement with the behavior of other bw companions observed in the galactic field .",
    "finally , we estimated a lower limit to the reprocessing factor of the pulsar flux ( @xmath141 ) by a rl filling companion .",
    "unfortunately , the star is too faint and located in a too crowded region to allow a spectroscopic follow - up with the available instruments .",
    "however , an optimized photometric follow - up aimed to detect the star at the minimum would give the opportunity to better constrain the light curve shape of the companion and hence to better characterize this binary system .",
    "one of the main objectives of this study is to contribute with observational data towards understanding the differences between bw systems in globular clusters and in the galaxy .",
    "this task is important because the formation of these systems is still poorly understood , and it is not known how much it is influenced by the local stellar density .",
    "however , given the limited statistics , particularly of systems with optical identifications , a detailed comparison of the two populations is premature at this stage .",
    "we refer the reader to a forthcoming paper with the results of a second optical identification of a bw in a globular cluster ( m. cadelano et al .",
