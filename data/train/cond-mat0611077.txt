    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling effect @xcite , originating from the effective magnetic field generated by the electric field under the relativistic transformation @xcite , has stimulated plenty of works in semiconductor spintronics @xcite .",
    "for its experimentally proved gate - voltage tunability @xcite , rotating the spins by rashba effect ( the rashba spin precession @xcite ) or even controlling the spin direction via the gate voltage @xcite are theoretically possible .",
    "it turns out that countless interesting spin phenomena based on the rashba effect have been proposed , including the spin interference effect .",
    "nitta _ et .",
    "_ first raised the issue of spin interferometer considering a quantum ring with strong rashba effect @xcite . later",
    "the analysis was extended from an ideal one - dimensional ( 1d ) ring to a two - dimensional ring under first quantization @xcite , and second quantization @xcite .",
    "another design of the spin interferometer using the square loop was also proposed @xcite , and is even experimentally proved recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose another design for the rashba spin interferometer , which can be analytically solved . with obtained formulae",
    ", we identify the spin interference into three categories : ( i ) quantum - mechanical @xmath0 rotation effect , which states that a quantum state ket needs a rotation of @xmath1 to bring it back , instead of @xmath2 @xcite ; ( ii ) geometric effect , which arises from the geometry - dependent phase difference ; ( iii ) shubnikov - de haas ( sdh)-like beating effect , which is the most distinctive feature of our proposal .",
    "consider an interferometer device composed of a quantum wire attached by a quantum half - ring , where the rashba spin - orbit coupling is present .",
    "see fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "an ideal spin injector is set up at one of the two connection points of the ring - wire structure , while spin interference is expected to occur at the other one .",
    "assume that the injected spin , described by a state ket @xmath3 , propagates through both the wire path , yielding the state ket @xmath4 at position @xmath5 , and the ring path , yielding @xmath6 at the angle @xmath7 , with equal probability . applying ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , spatially translate the injected spin which is assumed to be projected to the states at the fermi level @xcite , we can write down the individual state kets . for the straight wire , we have@xmath8with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the rashba strength within the wire , and @xmath12 are the spin - dependent wave vectors . in the present work",
    ", we will assume constant rashba strength in both the wire and the ring to facilitate the analytical derivation .",
    "spatial dependence of the rashba coupling , if considered , can be straightforwardly handled by the contour - integral method @xcite .",
    "for the half - ring , we similarly have@xmath13with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where we denote the rashba coupling strength within the ring as @xmath16 , which in general may differ from @xmath11 . in both eqs .",
    "( [ ketw ] ) and ( ketr ) , the well - known rashba eigenspinor is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the direction angle of the electron wave vector .",
    "( along @xmath5 axis we set @xmath19 . )    using eqs .",
    "( [ ketw ] ) and ( [ ketr ] ) , one can depict the spin vectors along individually the ring and the wire paths and clearly see the purpose of our design of combining one straight wire and one half - ring . in fig .",
    "fig1(b ) , we inject an @xmath5-polarized spin , which propagates precessionlessly along the half - ring and precessingly along the wire .",
    "conversely , if we inject a @xmath20-polarized spin , the precessing and precessionless situations switch , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "when tuning the rashba coupling strength ( via the gate voltage @xcite ) , which is equivalent to an effective magnetic field , the spin coming out from the wire ( ring ) is rotated while that from the ring ( wire ) is fixed in the case of @xmath5-polarized ( @xmath20-polarized ) injection of spin .",
    "we therefore expect to see the effect of the quantum - mechanical rotation of the state ket with @xmath0 periods @xcite , mapped from the external magnetic field in vacuum to the effective magnetic field in solids .",
    "we proceed by deriving the explicit form of @xmath21 . at the interference region , the spin - interfered state",
    "is superposed by @xmath22 , regardless of normalization .",
    "next we define the dimensionless parameter@xmath23which are responsible for the rashba coupling and characterize the precession angle of the injected spin @xmath24 and @xmath25 . furthermore , under the assumption that the spin is injected at @xmath26 so that we have @xmath27 , we can define@xmath28where @xmath29 is dimensionless .",
    "therefore , we have the spin - interfered state@xmath30    we now consider the specific cases of spin injection , namely , the @xmath5-polarized and the @xmath20-polarized injection of spin . substituting @xmath31 into eq .",
    "( |si > ) , one can , after some mathematical manipulation , obtain the spin - interfered state ket @xmath32 , yielding the spin interference@xmath33similarly , with @xmath34 we have@xmath35",
    "in the following we will use eqs .",
    "( [ six ] ) and ( [ siy ] ) , together with eqs .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) , to demonstrate the @xmath0 rotation effect , the geometric effect , and the sdh - like beating effect in the proposed interferometer device .",
    "specifically , we consider ingaas - based materials with the electron effective mass @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the electron rest mass ) and the maximal rashba coupling strength @xmath38",
    "@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "consider the interferometer with the rashba strength of the wire ( or @xmath41 ) tunable , while that of the ring ( or @xmath42 ) fixed .",
    "the ring radius is set @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "we inject the spin at @xmath45 @xmath46 , and tune @xmath11 from @xmath47 to @xmath38 @xmath48 , corresponding to about @xmath49 . considering the @xmath5-polarized injection of spin ,",
    "the @xmath0 rotation effect is clearly seen , as shown in fig . [ fig_x](a ) .",
    "figure [ figy](a ) also shows the @xmath0 rotation effect in the case of @xmath50-polarized injection of spin . in general",
    ", the period of @xmath0 exists whenever we tune the rashba strength only on one side . referring to eq .",
    "( [ |si > ] ) and noting that @xmath51 @xmath52 constant for the given @xmath53 here [ see eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) ] , one can see that the @xmath0 period stems from the partial wave @xmath54 passing through the wire . when superposing @xmath54 with an arbitrary fixed state ( not parallel to @xmath55 ) , the oscillation with the @xmath0 period , which can never be obtained by such a normalized state @xmath54 only , is revealed .",
    "we now tune @xmath42 and @xmath56 simultaneously ( @xmath57 ) via an on - board gate voltage , with other parameters identical with the previous discussion . in this case",
    "the oscillation behavior is completely changed , as can be seen in figs . [ fig_x](b ) for the @xmath5-polarized case and [ figy](b ) for the @xmath20-polarized case .",
    "such an interference effect originates from the difference in @xmath58 and @xmath59 shown in eqs .",
    "( [ ketw ] ) and ( [ ketr ] ) , and is therefore a geometric effect .",
    "note that here since @xmath60 , which is an irrational number of multiple of @xmath61 , the state can no longer be returned to its original state , in principle .",
    "note the distinct interference outcomes between figs .",
    "[ fig_x](a ) and fig_x(b ) , subject to exactly the same spin vectors along the individual wire and ring paths [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] ! in this @xmath5-polarized case , whether tuning @xmath42 or not , the spin vectors along the ring are always fixed , since one of the spin channel is blocked . specifically , the expansion coefficients for the ring path are @xmath62 ( the kronecker delta symbol defined by @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) so that @xmath66 carries the information of _ fixed _ spin directions , no matter the phase is tuned or not . however",
    ", superposing @xmath54 with @xmath67 will eventually bring the interference spectrum into @xmath68 , which depends on whether @xmath69 is varying or not .",
    "finally , we arrive at another feature of our spin interferometer , namely , the beating effect .",
    "if we extend the range of @xmath56 by considering a larger @xmath70 , say @xmath71 @xmath44 , and inject the spin at an lower energy , say @xmath72 m@xmath46 , one can clearly see the beating effect in the @xmath5-polarized case using the separate control , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig_x](c ) . on the contrary ,",
    "such a beating effect can not be observed when injecting a @xmath20-polarized spin , whether using the separate control or the on - board tuning .",
    "mathematically , the beating comes from the modulation of @xmath73 on @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ six ] ) for @xmath75 , while eq .",
    "( [ siy ] ) manifests that @xmath76 does not exhibit any beating since @xmath77 is oscillating with @xmath56 but @xmath78 is simply constant .",
    "note also that such a beating vanishes when injecting a high energy spin such that @xmath79 constant as in the previous cases , since the cosine part in eq .",
    "( [ six ] ) becomes a constant .",
    "physically , the beating effect is similar to that in the sdh oscillation . in the ordinary sdh effect , longitudinal resistance @xmath80 oscillates with the increasing applied perpendicular magnetic field @xmath81 , which turns the step - function - like density of states into ( broadened ) landau levels . with either spin - orbit coupling or an in - plane magnetic field @xmath82 , each landau level splits into two peaks due to spin , and",
    "the oscillation of @xmath83 will compose of two close but different frequencies , leading to the beating .    in the present rashba spin interferometer",
    ", increasing @xmath56 by the gate voltage is to increase the effective magnetic field , and we can thus map @xmath81 and @xmath80 in the ordinary sdh onto the rashba field strength ( or @xmath56 ) and @xmath84 in our sdh - like beating effect , respectively . in the latter case , the phase factors of the two spin components in the rashba - tuned wave function ( the state @xmath85 here ) are of frequencies proportional to their momentum @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the wave vector difference proportional to @xmath11 . when superposing @xmath54 with the fixed @xmath67 state , the two closely spaced frequencies lead to the beating , if the two spin components are equally occupied .",
    "this is why we can not observe the beating in the @xmath20-polarized case .",
    "( one spin channel along the wire is blocked so that only one frequency exists . )",
    "in conclusion , we have shown the spin interference due to rashba effect in our proposed device .",
    "obtained interference spectrum includes the 4@xmath88 rotation , the geometric , and the sdh - like beating effects .",
    "presented results suggest experimental measurement of simply the electric current through the device versus the rashba coupling strength , using either separate control or on - board tuning .",
    "the former shows @xmath0 periods while the latter does not , when injecting higher energy spins with any polarization . sdh - like beating is expected only when injecting @xmath5-polarized ( actually , also valid for @xmath89-polarized ) spins at low energy .",
    "the only nontrivial requirement is to tune @xmath90 by an enough wide range , which may require a larger ring , a stronger spin - orbit coupling , or even a heavier effective mass . to maintain the system as ballistic , meaning that the ring radius is of the order of mircro - meter , estimation of @xmath91 from eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) shows that inas- or ingaas - based materials seem to be the most feasible candidate .",
    "gaas - based material is less suggested , and sige / si / sige symmetric quantum wells are impossible in reality .",
