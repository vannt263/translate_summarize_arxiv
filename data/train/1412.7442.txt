    "in a free quantum theory particle numbers of various species are conserved . however ,",
    "if there is a time varying background or a source term in the system , particle number conservation gets broken and particles are produced by non - perturbative effects .",
    "it is well known that an oscillating electric field causes production of pairs of electrons @xcite , and time - varying or inhomogeneous metric causes gravitational particle production @xcite . in this context",
    "the period of post - inflationary preheating , when particles coupled to the inflaton field are produced on the expense of coherently oscillating inflaton background , is quite interesting for both particle physics and cosmology because the phenomenon not only marks the end of inflation but also produces matter constituting our observable universe @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in non - gravitational particle production with a signficant role of interaction ( non - quadratic ) terms .",
    "the basic mechanism of particle production can be explained with the help of a simple model @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively a complex and a real bosonic field , and @xmath3 is a real coupling constant .",
    "lagrangian ( [ eom ] ) may for example describe the coupling between inflaton @xmath1 and a standard model field @xmath2 resulting in production of visible particles . in this model @xmath4 becomes a special kind of point in the phase space where the other field becomes effectively massless .",
    "has the same properties . ]",
    "especially , in case of @xmath5 , particle vacuum can be realized for an arbitrary value of @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider the case with @xmath1 having a time - dependent vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath6 .",
    "asymptotically , when quantum effects can be neglected , one can choose a vacuum solution of ( [ eom ] ) in the form of uniform motion : @xmath7 where a real @xmath8 represents a velocity in the @xmath1-space and a real @xmath9 is an impact parameter measuring the distance of the classical trajectory from the ( massless ) point @xmath10 .",
    "when this trajectory approaches the massless point within the circle @xmath11 , which is the non - adiabaticity condition for @xmath2 , mass of @xmath2 becomes very small . as a result ,",
    "kinetic energy of the background field @xmath1 is transferred to the field @xmath2 and this leads to the production of @xmath2 particles whose distribution is calculated to be @xcite,@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a momentum of a @xmath2 particle .",
    "furthermore , an interesting phenomenon occurs after the initial period of @xmath2 particle production .",
    "once particles @xmath2 are created , and trajectory of @xmath6 goes away from the massless point , energy density of @xmath2 particles can be represented in the lagrangian by a term which has a meaning of mass multiplied by number density , i.e. @xmath14 this implies that a linear potential is established in the field space .",
    "due to the force exerted by this term in the lagrangian , after a while trajectory of @xmath6 may go back towards the origin and @xmath2 particles can be produced again . finally , after a number of cycles , trajectory @xmath6 may get trapped near the massless point .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to extend above considerations to the case where interactions between fields are significant and may become a leading effect , for instance in the absence of the effective mass terms . as an illustrative example we take a simple supersymmetric generalisation of the model ( [ eom ] ) with unbroken global supersymmetry .",
    "in such a case , fermionic particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are superpartners of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are added to the previous theory . as we will discuss later ,",
    "if @xmath1 has a vev then @xmath2 and @xmath16 obtain masses proportional to @xmath17 , while @xmath15 stays massless .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath2 and @xmath16 particles are produced . on the other hand",
    ", the mass of @xmath15 is not varying with time since it is absent from the lagrangian .",
    "however , since the theory we consider has more interactions , e.g. @xmath18 , we shall need to understand their effect on particle production . as a result",
    ", we will find that massless particle can in fact be produced due to interactions .",
    "outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the general framework used to calculate number density of produced particles in case of existence of the interaction terms and quantum corrections in the theory ; general form of bogoliubov transformation is also described there .",
    "section 3 focuses on application of the method described in section 2 to the particular supersymmetric model in both analytical and numerical approach .",
    "rather technical subsection 3.1 defines precisely asymptotic fields and bogoliubov transformations in our model .",
    "before we analyse a specific model , let us formulate the general recipe for calculation of the number of produced particles in the presence of quantum corrections .",
    "at first we define an occupation number of particles with momentum @xmath13 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an in - state vacuum , and @xmath21 is an annihilation operator defined by an out - state of vaccum . in order to calculate this quantity ,",
    "one employs usually the method of bogoliubov transformation . with this method one establishes the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are complex functions of @xmath26 .",
    "however , calculation of the bogoliubov coefficients becomes tricky when theory has large interaction terms .",
    "then , because the out - state is affected by other fields via interaction terms , the @xmath21 shall contain information about all field operators in the interacting model , not only about its own field operator .    in this section",
    "we will discuss how the bogoliubov coefficients are calculated in a complete interacting model .",
    "let us begin with a real scalar field @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the scalar field operator satisfies the following commutation relation @xmath28    = i\\delta^3(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y } ) \\label{eq : psi_com_rel1}\\ ] ] and equation of motion is of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a mass of @xmath27 which is a classical number ( i.e. not an operator ) , and @xmath31 is a source term which is an operator consisting of @xmath27 or other fields . in general @xmath30 may be a function of space - time coordinates @xmath32 , but here we assume only time - dependence for simplicity : @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) has a formal solution known as _ yang - feldman equation _",
    "@xcite given as @xmath34 j(y ) , \\label{eq : psi_yf}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is called an asymptotic field which satisfies free field equation @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the field renormalization constant .",
    "+ in general , source term @xmath31 is a function of interacting field operator .",
    "however , one can obtain a sequentially - iterated result from this formal solution substituting ( [ eq : psi_yf ] ) back to @xmath31 again .",
    "in particular , if we take @xmath38 , ( [ eq : psi_yf ] ) becomes @xmath39 therefore @xmath40 denotes a specific point of time when an interacting field @xmath27 can be regarded as a free field @xmath35 . using this relation",
    "one can represent the out - field ( defined at @xmath41 ) by the in - field ( defined at @xmath42 ) as follows : @xmath43 j(y ) .",
    "\\label{eq : psi_in - out - rel}\\ ] ] one can see that out - field operator depends not only on the in - field but also on the source term which contains interaction effects .    since ( [ eq : psi_as_eom ] ) is a free field equation of motion , solution of @xmath35",
    "can be expanded into wave functions as @xmath44 , \\label{eq : psi_as_expand}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is an annihilation operator which , following equation ( [ eq : psi_as_eom ] ) , satisfies commutation relation @xmath46    = ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta^3(\\mathbf{k - k ' } ) , \\qquad ( { \\rm other \\ : relations } ) = 0 \\label{eq : psi_com_rel2}\\ ] ] and @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 ) is a time dependent wave function which satisfies @xmath49 using commutation relations ( [ eq : psi_com_rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : psi_com_rel2 ] ) , one can obtain a time - independent inner product relation ) and then uses equation of motion . ] for the wave function : @xmath50 with this formula one can extract @xmath45 from @xmath35 as follows : @xmath51 it means that a component along the @xmath47-direction is projected out of @xmath35 by means of the inner product ( [ eq : inner_pro ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ ann ] ) for out - states can be obtained using ( [ eq : psi_in - out - rel ] ) as @xmath52 j(y ) \\nonumber        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath53 where time - independent coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined as @xmath54 from these relations one learns how much of @xmath55 or @xmath56 can be found in @xmath57 .",
    "thus one can regard @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the bogoliubov coefficients , which satisfy the following properties : @xmath58 and proper normalization @xmath59 hence , formulae ( [ eq : bbt ] ) and ( [ eq : bt_a ] ) represent a bogoliubov transformation law generalized to the case of interacting theory .",
    "first two terms in these expressions correspond to the usual bogoliubov transfomation law arising from the time ( or space ) variation of masses in the lagrangian and has nothing to do with the source operator @xmath60 .",
    "the third term describes the effects coming from interaction terms ( quantum corrections ) .",
    "finally , expression ( [ eq : bt_a ] ) enables us to establish the formula for the occupation number of produced particles in case of interacting theory @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the volume of the system .",
    "this result shows that because of the interaction effects particle production can be induced in both cases , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , even though the leading term of @xmath65 for @xmath63 is equal to zero .",
    "+ analogous results hold for fermions , with a different commutation relation .",
    "in this section we consider production of particles in a specific model . for the sake of simplicity we assume unbroken supersymmetry and the superpotential @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are chiral superfields which interact with a coupling strength @xmath3 .",
    "corresponding interaction lagrangian reads @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the scalar / fermion components of @xmath67 and @xmath68 supermultiplets respectively .",
    "the massless point is @xmath72 and @xmath1 can have an arbitrary value there .",
    "therefore if @xmath1 has a vev @xmath73 , then @xmath2 and @xmath16 are given a mass @xmath74 but as we quantize a deviation from the vev , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath15 remain massless .",
    "there are two simplifications when one restricts oneself to this toy model .",
    "the first one is that we can calculate number of produced particles without worrying about mass counterterms due to supersymmetry .",
    "the second is that this is a minimal supersymmetric model which contains not only fields with time - varying masses but also massless fields .",
    "these facts indicate that the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath25 for massive fields ( @xmath77 ) becomes non - zero , on the other hand , @xmath63 for the massless fields ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "as shown in the previous section , it is possible to produce these massless particles even if @xmath63 due to interaction effects .",
    "therefore we can compare the produced particle number in all cases between @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "in this , rather technical , section we demonstrate derivation of the bogoliubov transformation laws for all component fields present in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the procedure follows steps outlined in section [ sec : qe ] .    from ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) one obtains a set of usual equations of motion : @xmath79 with source terms given as @xmath80 in the above formulae we took into account the possible influence of the vev @xmath6 on @xmath2 and @xmath16 masses .    following ( [ source ] )",

    "it should be noted , that the usual bogoliubov coefficients are absent in case of massless field @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",

    "therefore , at least from the perturbative point of view , we can conclude that the main effect in the massless particle production comes from inverse decay processes of massive particles in varying external background .",
    "as far as the loop corrections are concerned , their effect on particle production in case of the weak coupling is supressed by the growing powers of g multiplied by small numerical loop - factors . in case of a strong coupling",
