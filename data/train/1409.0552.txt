    "in recent years , noncommutative geometry has received a considerable interest to get insight into many conceptual issues in the quantum domain of high energy physics .",

    "it is similar to the way the plank s constant @xmath4 discretizes phase - space@xcite .",
    "the noncommutative approach provides the construction of a black hole with a minimum scale @xmath5 , known as noncommutative black hole@xcite , whose commutative limit is the schwarzschild metric .",
    "it is note worthy that noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of the space - time and it does not depend on the curvature of space - time .",
    "a large number of studies inspired by noncommutative geometry are available in the literature .",
    "et al_@xcite have discussed thermodynamic behaviour and evaporation processes involved in a noncommutative black hole . in their investigations , they have considered a noncommutative @xmath0-dimensional black hole whose commutative limit is the non - rotating ba@xmath6ados , teitelboim and zanelli@xcite ( henceforth btz ) black hole .",
    "nozari and mehdipour@xcite have investigated the hawking radiation from a noncommutative black hole .",

    "it has been shown that in the limit of large @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) outside the horizon , the metric behaves like the standard schwarzschild solution , whereas in the limit of small @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) inside the horizon , the space - time is de - sitter type with a constant positive curvature .",

    "we write the line element for the interior space - time of a static circularly symmetric charged distribution of matter in ( @xmath17)-dimensions in the form @xmath19 the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the charged fluid distribution is assumed to be @xmath20 where , @xmath16 is the energy - density , @xmath21 is the radial pressure and @xmath22 is the tangential pressure . in ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath23 is the velocity of the fluid and @xmath24 is a radial unit vector satisfying the relation @xmath25 .",
