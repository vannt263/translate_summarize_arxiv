    "in this paper we consider a sine - gordon - type equation describing the gauge invariant phase difference of a long josephson junction @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the spatial and temporal variable respectively ; @xmath3 is the josephson phase difference of the junction ; @xmath4 is the damping coefficient due to normal electron flow across the junction ; and @xmath5 is the applied bias current .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 represents the josephson tunneling critical current , which can vary as a function of the spatial variable .    when @xmath6 is constant ( without loss of generality , we can take @xmath7 ) and there is no imposed current and dissipation , i.e. , @xmath8 ,",
    "the system  ( [ eq.junction ] ) is completely integrable  @xcite and has a family of travelling kink solutions of the form @xmath9 in the study of josephson junctions , this kink represents a fluxon , i.e.  a magnetic field with one flux quantum @xmath10 wb . if there is a small induced current and dissipation but no inhomogeneity , then there is a unique travelling fluxon whose wave speed in lowest order is given by @xmath11 and no stationary fluxons exist , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it was first suggested and shown in @xcite that if the critical current @xmath6 is locally perturbed , stationary fluxons can exist even if an imposed current is present ( @xmath12 ) and that a traveling fluxon  ( [ fluxon ] ) can be pinned by the inhomogeneity .",
    "this phenomenon is of interests from physical and fundamental point of view because such an inhomogeneity could be present in experiments due to the nonuniformity in the width of the transmission josephson junction line ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) or in the thickness of the oxide barrier between the superconductors forming the junction ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . about a decade after the first analysis of this phenomenon",
    ", it is shown in  @xcite that the interaction between a soliton and an inhomogeneity can be non - trivial , i.e.  an attractive impurity , which is supposed to pin an incoming fluxon , could totally reflect the soliton provided that there is no damping in the system .",
    "recently it is proven that the final state at which a soliton exits a collision depends in a complicated fractal way on the incoming velocity  @xcite .",
    "so far almost all of the analytical and theoretical work describes the local inhomogeneity by a delta - like function  @xcite . yet , the length of an inhomogeneity in real experiments is varying from 0.5@xmath13 @xcite to 5@xmath13 @xcite , with @xmath13 being the josephson penetration depth .",
    "therefore , such inhomogeneities are not well described by delta - functions .",
    "kivshar et al .",
    "@xcite have considered the _ time - dependent _ dynamics of a josephson fluxon in the presence of this more realistic setup , i.e.  fluxon scatterings that take into account the finite size of the defect , within the framework of a perturbation theory , i.e. , when @xmath14 are small and @xmath15 .",
    "piette and zakrzewski  @xcite recently studied the scattering of the fluxon on a finite inhomogeneity , extending @xcite for finite length defects in the case when neither applied bias current nor dissipation is present .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of a long josephson junction with a finite - length inhomogeneity and give a systematic analysis of the existence and stability of stationary fluxons , i.e. , the pinned fluxons , as they lie at the heart of the interaction of the travelling fluxons with the inhomogeneity .",
    "the josephson tunneling critical current ( denoted by  @xmath6 in  ( [ eq.junction ] ) ) is a function of space and is modelled by the step - function @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the inhomogeneity , as modelled by  ( [ def ] ) , can be fabricated experimentally with a high controllability and precision , such that the strength and the length of the defect @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be made as one wishes ( see @xcite and references therein for reviews of the experimental setups ) .",
    "when the parameter @xmath18 is greater or less than one , the inhomogeneity is called a microresonator respectively microresistor",
    ". they can be thought of as a locally thinned respectively thickened junction , which provide less respectively more resistance for the josephson supercurrent to go across the junction barrier .",
    "note that as ( [ eq.junction ] ) without inhomogeneity is translationally invariant , it does not matter where the inhomogeneity is placed .",
    "the existence and stability problem of pinned fluxons in _ finite _ josephson junctions with inhomogeneity ( [ def ] ) has been considered numerically by boyadjiev et al .",
    "here we consider an infinitely long josephson junction with inhomogeneity  ( [ def ] ) and provide a full analytical study of the existence and stability of pinned fluxons , using dynamical systems techniques , hamiltonian systems ideas , and sturm - liouville theory .",
    "for the existence of the pinned fluxons we observe that , as @xmath20 for @xmath21 large , it follows immediately that the asymptotic fixed points of  ( [ eq.junction ] ) are given by @xmath22 , and the temporally stable stationary uniform solutions are @xmath23 .",
    "bu definition , a pinned fluxon is a stationary solution of  ( [ eq.junction ] ) , which connects  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 .",
    "hence a pinned fluxon is a solution of the boundary value problem @xmath26   \\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\phi(x)=\\arcsin\\gamma + 2\\pi     { \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad } \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty } \\phi(x)=\\arcsin\\gamma .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] first we observe that pinned fluxons can only exist for bounded values of the applied bias current , @xmath27 ( where this upperbound is directly related to our choice to set @xmath28 outside the defect ) . moreover , there are symmetries in this system . if @xmath29 is a pinned fluxon connecting @xmath24 ( at @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( at @xmath32 ) , then @xmath33 is a solution as well , connecting @xmath31 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "so the second solution is a pinned anti - fluxon .",
    "the symmetry implies that we can focus on pinned fluxons and all results for pinned anti - fluxons follow by using the symmetry @xmath34 .",
    "another important symmetry is @xmath35 thus if @xmath29 is a pinned fluxon with bias current @xmath5 , then @xmath36 is a pinned fluxon with bias current @xmath37 .",
    "this means that we can restrict to a bias current @xmath38 and the case @xmath39 follows from the symmetry above .",
    "furthermore , the differential equation in  ( [ eq.ham_ode_system ] ) is a ( non - autonomous ) hamiltonian ode with hamiltonian @xmath40 the non - autonomous term has the form of a step function , which implies that on each individual interval @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the hamiltonian is fixed , though the value of the hamiltonian will vary from interval to interval",
    ". therefore the solutions of  ( [ eq.ham_ode ] ) can be found via a phase plane analysis , consisting of combinations of the phase portraits for the system with @xmath7 and @xmath44 , see also  @xcite for a similar approach to get existence of @xmath45-kinks . in the phase plane analysis ,",
    "the length of the inhomogeneity  ( @xmath19 ) is treated as a parameter . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the pinned fluxon follows one of the two unstable manifolds of fixed point  @xmath47 of the reduced ode  ( [ eq.ham_ode_system ] ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath48 the pinned fluxon follows one of the stable manifolds of the fixed point @xmath49 .",
    "finally , for @xmath50 the pinned fluxon corresponds to a part of one of the orbits of the phase portrait for the system with @xmath44 .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the orbit in this system implies the existence of pinned fluxons for various lengths of the inhomogeneity .",
    "see figure  [ fig.example_phase ] for an example of the construction of a pinned fluxons when @xmath51 and @xmath52 .     and @xmath52 .",
    "the dash - dotted red curves are the unstable manifolds of @xmath47 , the dashed magenta curves are the stable manifolds of @xmath53 , and the solid blue curves are examples of orbits for the dynamcis inside the inhomogeneity .",
    "the bold green curve is an example of a pinned fluxon.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    orbits of a hamiltonian system can be characterised by the value of the hamiltonian , hence there is a relation between the value of the hamiltonian inside the inhomogeneity and the length of the inhomogeneity .",
    "the resulting pinned fluxon is in @xmath54 .",
    "as the ode  ( [ eq.ham_ode_system ] ) usually implies that the second derivative of the pinned fluxon will be discontinuous , this is also the best possible function space for the pinned fluxon solutions .",
    "after analysing the existence of the pinned fluxons and having found a plethora of possible pinned fluxons when a bias current is applied to the josephson junction ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , we will consider their stability .",
    "first we will consider linear stability . to derive the linearised operator about a pinned fluxon  @xmath55 , write @xmath56 and linearise about  @xmath57 to get the eigenvalue problem @xmath58 and the linearisation operator @xmath59 is @xmath60 the natural domain for @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "we call @xmath63 an eigenvalue of @xmath61 if there is a function @xmath64 , which satisfies @xmath65 .",
    "this operator is self - adjoint , hence all eigenvalues will be real .",
    "furthermore , it is a sturm - liouville operator , thus the sobolev embedding theorem gives that the eigenfunctions are continuously differentiable functions in @xmath62 .",
    "theorem  @xcite can be applied , leading to the fact that the eigenvalues are simple and bounded from above . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath66 is an eigenfunction of @xmath61 with eigenvalue @xmath67 and @xmath68 is an eigenfunction of @xmath61 with eigenvalue @xmath69 with @xmath70 , then there is at least one zero of @xmath68 between any pair of zeros of @xmath66 ( including the zeros at @xmath71 ) .",
    "hence , the eigenfunction @xmath66 has a fixed sign ( no zeros ) if and only if @xmath67 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath61 .",
    "the continuous spectrum of @xmath61 is determined by the system at @xmath71 .",
    "a short calculation shows that the continuous spectrum is the interval @xmath72 .",
    "if the largest eigenvalue @xmath63 of @xmath61 is not positive or if @xmath61 does not have any eigenvalues , then the pinned fluxon is linearly stable , otherwise it is linearly unstable .",
    "this follows immediately from analysing the quadratic @xmath73 . if @xmath74 , then both solutions @xmath75 have non - positive real part .",
    "however , if @xmath76 is then there is a solution @xmath75 with positive real part .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath75-values of the continuous spectrum also have non - positive real part as the continuous spectrum of @xmath61 is on the negative real axis .",
    "the linear stability can be used to show nonlinear stability .",
    "the josephson junction system without dissipation is hamiltonian . define @xmath77 , @xmath78 ,",
    "then the equations  ( [ eq.junction ] ) can be written as a hamiltonian dynamical system with dissipation on an infinite dimensional vector space of @xmath1-dependent functions , which is equivalent to @xmath79 : @xmath80 and @xmath81 \\ , dx\\\\ & & { } -\\gamma\\displaystyle   \\int_0^\\infty[\\phi-\\arcsin\\gamma-2\\pi]\\,dx      + \\gamma\\int_{-\\infty}^0[\\phi-\\arcsin\\gamma]\\ , dx . \\end{array}\\ ] ] here we have chosen the constants terms in the @xmath5-integrals such that they are convergent for the fluxons .",
    "furthermore , for any solution @xmath82 of  ( [ eq.junction ] ) , we have @xmath83 as a pinned fluxon is a stationary solution , we have @xmath84 and the hessian of @xmath85 about a fluxon is @xmath86 if @xmath61 has only strictly negative eigenvalues , then it follows immediately that @xmath87 is a minimum of the hamiltonian and  ( [ eq.ham_dyn ] ) gives that all solutions nearby the pinned fluxon will stay nearby the pinned fluxon , see also  @xcite .    after this introduction , we will start the paper with an overview of simulations for the interaction of travelling fluxons and the inhomogeneity in  ( [ eq.junction ] ) for various values of @xmath18 , @xmath88 , @xmath5 and @xmath89 .",
    "this will motivate the analysis of the existence and stability of the pinned fluxons in the following sections .",
    "we start the analysis of the existence and stability of pinned fluxons by looking at a microresistor with @xmath90 .",
    "the advantage of the case @xmath90 is that several explicit expressions can be derived and technical difficulties can be kept to a minimum , while it is also representative of the general case @xmath91 .",
    "it will be shown that for @xmath92 there is exactly one pinned fluxon for each length of the inhomogeneity . for @xmath93 ,",
    "a plethora of solutions starts emerging .",
    "there is a minimum and maximum length outside which the inhomogeneity can not sustain pinned fluxons . between the minimal and the maximal length",
    "there are at least two pinned fluxons , often more . at each length between the minimum and maximum",
    ", there is exactly one stable pinned fluxon .",
    "if the length of the interval is ( relatively ) large , the stable pinned fluxons are non - monotonic .",
    "note that stable non - monotonic fluxons are not possible in homogeneous systems , since for a homogeneous system the derivative of the fluxon is an eigenfunction for the eigenvalue zero of the operator associated with the linearisation about the fluxon . if the fluxon is non - monotonous , then this eigenfunction has zeros .",
    "as the linearisation operator is a sturm - liouville operator , this implies that the operator must have a positive eigenvalue as well , hence the non - monotonous fluxon is unstable .",
    "however , for inhomogeneous systems , the derivative of the fluxon is usually not differentiable , hence can not give rise to an eigenvalue zero ( since the eigenfunctions have to be @xmath94 ) and stable non - monotonic fluxons are in principle possible .",
    "this shows that the inhomogeneity can give rise to qualitatively different fluxons .    for the existence analysis of the pinned fluxons ,",
    "the length of the inhomogeneity will be treated as a parameter .",
    "the pinned fluxons satisfy an inhomogeneous hamiltonian ode whose hamiltonian is constant inside the inhomogeneity .",
    "it will be shown that the existence and type of pinned fluxons can be parametrised by the value of this hamiltonian .",
    "the length of the inhomogeneity is determined by the value of the hamiltonian and the type of pinned fluxon , leading to curves relating the length  @xmath19 and the value of the hamiltonian inside the inhomogeneity . in",
    "@xcite it is shown , in the general setting of an inhomogeneous wave equation , that changes in stability of the pinned fluxons can be associated with critical points of the length function relating @xmath88 and the value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the results of this paper together with sturm - liouville theory give the stability properties of the pinned fluxons in the general setting .",
    "after giving full details for the case @xmath90 , for which the stability issue can be settled in dependent of  @xcite , an overview of the results for @xmath95 is given .",
    "the general microresistor case ( @xmath96 ) is very similar to the case @xmath90 .",
    "the microresonator case ( @xmath97 ) has some different features , but the same techniques as before can be used to analyse the existence and stability .",
    "we finish the analysis of the microresonator case by looking at the special case where microresonators approximate a localised inhomogeneity .",
    "we explicitly look at microresonators with @xmath98 and @xmath88 very small . for @xmath5 , @xmath89 and @xmath99 small , the asymptotic results from  @xcite are recovered . even in the limit of localised inhomogeneities , our work generalises  @xcite , since our methods allows us to consider @xmath5 , @xmath89 and @xmath99 larger as well .",
    "the paper concludes with some further observations , conclusions and ideas for future research .",
    "to put the analysis of the existence and stability of the pinned fluxons in the next sections in a wider context , we look first at simulations of the interaction of a travelling fluxon with an inhomogeneity . recall that in absence of dissipation and induced currents ( @xmath100 ) , the system  ( [ eq.junction ] ) without an inhomogeneity ( @xmath101 , has a family of travelling fluxon solutions  ( [ fluxon ] ) , for each wave speed @xmath102 , while if there is a small induced current and dissipation , but no inhomogeneity , then there is a unique travelling fluxon .",
    "first we look at the case @xmath100 ( no induced current , no dissipation ) and the inhomogeneity of microresistor type with @xmath90 .",
    "if the length is too short , the fluxon will not be captured , but its speed will be reduced by the passage through the inhomogeneity . if the length of the inhomogeneity is sufficiently large , the travelling fluxon will be captured .",
    "some radiation is released in this process and the fluxon `` bounces '' backwards and forwards around the defect , especially if the length is `` just long enough '' .",
    "this is consistent with the results in  @xcite where a detailed analysis of the interaction of a fluxon with an inhomogeneity is studied in the case that no induced current and dissipation are present .",

    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite and references therein for reviews of theoretical and experimental results on window josephson junctions .",
    "recently , fluxon scatterings in a 2d setup in the presence of a non - zero defect has been considered as well in  @xcite .",

    "<S> , we determine the stability of all constructed pinned fluxons . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if a given system is able to sustain at least one pinned fluxon , there is exactly one stable pinned fluxon , i.e. the system selects one unique stable pinned configuration . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is shown that both for microresistors and microresonators this stable pinned configuration may be non - monotonic  something which is not possible in the homogeneous case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is shown that results in the literature on localised inhomogeneities can be recovered as limits of our results on microresonators .    </S>",
