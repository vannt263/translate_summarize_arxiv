    "the transport of heat through small and low dimensional systems has enormous significance in the context of designing useful nano - structures @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown@xcite that a narrow solid strip trapped by an external potential@xcite and surrounded by its own fluid relieves mechanical stress via the ejection or absorption of single solid layers@xcite to and from the fluid .",
    "the trapping potential introduces large energy barriers for interfacial capillary fluctuations thereby forcing the solid - liquid interfaces on either side of the solid region to remain flat .",
    "the small size of the solid also inhibits the creation of defects since the associated inhomogeneous elastic displacement fields need to relax to zero quickly at the boundaries , making the elastic energy cost for producing equilibrium defects prohibitively large .",
    "therefore the only energetically favourable fluctuations are those that involve transfer of _ complete _ layers which cause at most a homogeneous strain in the solid@xcite .",
    "such layering transitions were shown to affect the sound absorption properties of the trapped solid in rather interesting ways@xcite .",
    "what effect , if any , do such layering transitions have for the transfer of heat ?    heat transport across model liquid - solid interfaces has been studied in three dimensions for particles with lennard jones interactions in ref.@xcite along the liquid - solid coexistence line .",
    "the dependence of the kapitza ( interfacial ) resistance@xcite on the wetting properties of the equilibrum interface was the focus of this study .",
    "it was shown that a larger density jump at the interface causes higher interfacial thermal resistance . in this letter",
    ", we use a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to investigate heat conduction through a trapped solid ( in two dimensions ) as it undergoes layering transitions as a response to changes in the depth of the trapping potential .",
    "apart from the layering transition reported in ref.@xcite we find another mode of structural readjustment viz .",
    "increase in the number of atoms in the lattice planes parallel to the interface by the spontaneous generation and annihilation of dislocation pairs .",
    "the heat conductance , in our study , shows strong signatures of both of these structural transformations of the trapped solid .",
    "we consider a two dimensional ( 2d ) system of @xmath0 atoms of average density @xmath1 within a rectangular box of area @xmath2 ( fig.[sys](a ) ) .",
    "the applied potential , @xmath3 for @xmath4 which goes to zero with a hyperbolic tangent profile of width @xmath5 elsewhere , enhances the density ( @xmath6 ) in the central region @xmath7 of area @xmath8 , ultimately leading it to a solid like phase . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs in contact with the liquid regions at either end .    a large number of recent studies in lower dimensions has shown that heat conductivity is , in fact , divergent as a function of system size@xcite .",
    "thus it is more sensible to directly calculate the heat current @xmath11 flowing from the high to low temperature , or the conductance of the system @xmath12 ( or resistance @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 being the temperature difference , rather than the heat conductivity .",
    "we report results for @xmath15 particles interacting via the soft disk potential @xmath16 taken within an area of @xmath17 . in absence of any external potential ,",
    "a 2d system of soft disks at this density @xmath18 remains in the fluid phase .",

    "we use the standard velocity verlet scheme of molecular dynamics ( md)@xcite with equal time update of time - step @xmath27 , except when the particles collide with the ` hard walled ' heat reservoirs at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we treat the collision between the particles and the reservoir as that between a hard disk of unit diameter colliding against a hard , structure - less wall .",
    "if the time , @xmath30 , of the next collision with any of the two reservoirs at either end is smaller than @xmath31 , the usual update time step of the md simulation , we update the system with @xmath30 . during collisions with the walls maxwell boundary conditions are imposed to simulate the velocity of an atom emerging out of a reservoir at temperatures @xmath32 ( at @xmath28 ) or @xmath33 ( at @xmath29)@xcite :    f(v)=()^3/2 |v_y|(- ) where @xmath34 is the temperature ( @xmath9 or @xmath35 ) of the wall on which the collision occurs . during each collision",
    ", energy is exchanged between the system and the bath . in the steady state , the average heat current flowing through the system can , therefore , be found easily by computing the net heat loss from the system to the two baths ( say @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively ) during a large time interval @xmath38 .",
