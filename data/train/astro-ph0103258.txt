    "the recent breakthrough in our understanding of gamma - ray bursts resulted from associating of these events with host galaxies .",
    "this association demonstrates that most , and probably all , bursts are at cosmological distances . whether measured from absorption lines in the continuum of optical transients or emission lines in the host galaxies spectra ,",
    "the redshifts show that the bursts are even further than predicted by the simplest `` minimal '' cosmological model @xcite . with assumptions about the radiation pattern",
    ", the energy radiated by the burst is calculated from the redshifts and the burst fluence .",
    "the position of the burst within the host argues for a strong connection between star formation and the burst @xcite .",
    "many of the galaxies show evidence of vigorous star formation .",
    "we now have a sufficient sample of detected host galaxies to consider various distributions of burst properties which require the distance to the burst . here",
    "we calculate the distributions of the total energy and peak luminosity radiated by the burst and the x - ray energy in the afterglow .",
    "the energy scale is a strong constraint on burst scenarios ; some proposed sources are insufficient to provide the necessary observed energy",
    ". however , the width and shape of the energy distributions are also consequences of the emission process . for example , in the current physical scenario @xcite the gamma - rays are radiated by `` internal '' shocks resulting from the collision of regions with different lorentz factors within a relativistic outflow . thus the total gamma - ray emission may depend on the vagaries of the central source accelerating the outflow .",
    "however , the afterglow is attributed to the `` external '' shock where the outflow collides with the external medium .",
    "thus the afterglow may be a bolometric measurement of the energy content of the relativistic flow .",
    "this is the basis of the `` patch shell '' model s prediction that the gamma - ray energy distribution should be broader than that of the afterglows @xcite .    to expand the burst sample ,",
    "we include not only bursts with spectroscopic redshifts , but also bursts for which there are only host galaxy magnitudes .",
    "a galaxy magnitude can be mapped into a probability distribution for the burst s redshift .",
    "this mapping requires a model of the host galaxy distribution ; competing models are tested by comparing the measured spectroscopic redshifts with the magnitude - derived redshift distribution for those bursts with both a spectroscopic redshift and a host galaxy magnitude .",
    "this host galaxy model is intrinsically interesting since it indicates whether the burst rate is proportional to the host galaxy mass or luminosity .",
    "an underlying assumption in our study is that the burst energy and luminosity distributions have not changed over the universe s lifetime .",
    "similarly , we assume that a burst s energy or luminosity is uncorrelated with the host galaxy magnitude .    in  2 we present the expected fluence distribution given the assumed lognormal burst energy distribution . ",
    "3 describes the sources of the observed @xmath8-ray and x - ray energy fluxes and fluences .",
    " 4 discusses the determination of a burst redshift from a single optical magnitude of the host galaxy .",
    "however , galaxy surveys count individual galaxies while the burst rate may be proportional to the mass or luminosity of a galaxy ; therefore in  5 we consider the underlying host galaxy luminosity function . the burst @xmath8-ray and x - ray energy distributions",
    "are calculated in  6 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  7 .",
    "here we present the methodology for modeling the distribution of the total burst energy @xmath9 given a set of observed burst fluences .",
    "the determination of the distribution of the peak gamma - ray luminosity and of the x - ray afterglow energy are analogous .",
    "we begin by assuming that @xmath9 has a log - normal distribution , @xmath10 d(\\log e_\\gamma )     \\quad .\\ ] ] thus the bolometric fluence @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the luminosity distance ) has the log - normal distribution @xmath13 d(\\log f )     \\quad .\\ ] ] note that @xmath14 is a width in logarithmic space , and the linear change of variables does not affect this width .",
    "this probability for the fluence assumes that the redshift is known .",
    "if not , then we have to convolve eq .  2 with the probability distribution for the host galaxy redshift , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the optical data we have about the redshift ( e.g. , the measured spectroscopic redshift from spectral lines or the host galaxy magnitude ) .",
    "the resulting probability is @xmath17 d(\\log f ) \\quad . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are the distributions for @xmath9 and @xmath18 , regardless of whether these quantities are actually observable .",
    "the distributions for the observable bursts must therefore be truncated at the threshold value of the fluence , @xmath19 , and the overall distribution must be renormalized .",
    "thus @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the heaviside function ( 1 above @xmath22 , and 0 below ) .",
    "since batse triggers on the peak count rate @xmath23 and not the fluence , the threshold fluence @xmath19 is the observed fluence divided by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the threshold count rate ( i.e. , the minimum peak count rate at which batse would have triggered ) .",
    "thus @xmath19 and @xmath26 vary from burst to burst . for calculations of the x - ray afterglow energy",
    "the x - ray detectability threshold must be used instead of @xmath19 .",
    "the likelihood is the product of these probabilities evaluated with each burst s observed properties ( fluence , redshift , etc . ) for all bursts in the sample . by maximizing this likelihood",
    "we find the preferred values and confidence ranges for @xmath27 and @xmath14 ( or the equivalent for the x - ray afterglow ) .",
    "note that the selection effect introduced by observing bursts at different redshifts  only intrinsically bright high redshift bursts are observable  while the detector threshold varies is mitigated by truncating the probability distribution for the observable fluence at the threshold value .",
    "we consider the sample of grbs with observed optical afterglows and with detected host galaxies , whether or not a redshift has been measured , for bursts between 1997 january and 2000 june ( _ cgro _ s untimely demise ) . to obtain a uniform estimate of the @xmath8-ray energy fluence we consider only those bursts detected by batse .",
    "the bursts with batse data and a spectroscopic redshift are gb970508 , gb970828 , gb971214 , gb980425 , gb980703 , gb990123 , gb990506 , gb990510 , and gb991216 ; however , gb980425 is exceptional because of its possible association with a supernova in a relatively nearby galaxy and we do not include it in our sample .",
    "the bursts with batse data and only an r magnitude for its host galaxy are gb971227 , gb980326 , gb980329 , and gb980519 .",
    "in addition , both r magnitudes and spectroscopic redshifts but no batse data are available for gb970228 , gb980613 , and gb990712 .",
    "for gb990510 there is currently a spectroscopic redshift but no host galaxy r magnitude .",
    "thus , there are eight bursts for which we can calculate the total emitted energy , and another four for which we can calculate a range of possible energies .",
    "there are ten bursts for which we have both spectroscopic redshifts and a host galaxy r magnitude ; from these ten we determine a model of the host galaxy population , as described below .    to calculate the total gamma - ray energy emitted by a burst we need the observed gamma - ray fluence .",
    "we determine the fluence of a given burst by fitting the spectrum accumulated over the time segment during which there was detectable emission . for strong bursts we use spectra from batse s spectroscopy detectors ( sds ) , while for weak bursts we fit spectra from batse s large area detectors ( lads ) . since batse consisted of 8 modules , each with an sd and an lad , more than one detector observed each burst . for strong bursts",
    "we choose the sd with the smallest burst angle ( the angle between its normal and the burst ) and with a gain sufficiently high to cover the 301000  kev energy band ( the sds were operated at different gains ) .",
    "a typical sd spectrum provides @xmath28 usable energy channels . for weak bursts we use the lad with the highest count rate which almost always had the smallest burst angle .",
    "these spectra were fitted with the `` band function '' @xcite , which consists of a low energy power law cut off by an exponential , @xmath29 $ ] ph s@xmath2 kev@xmath2 @xmath30 , which merges smoothly with a high energy power law , @xmath31 .",
    "the parameters of the resulting fits are given in the 2nd5th columns of table  [ table ] .",
    "the energy fluence @xmath32 ( 6th column of the table ) is obtained by integrating this fit over the energy band 202000  kev and over the time for which there was detectable emission ( the 10th column ) .",
    "this is the energy band of the fluences provided by the batse catalogue . in most cases",
    "the fluence in this energy band is very nearly the bolometric fluence , and thus no k - corrections are necessary to calculate the energies for bursts at different redshifts ( the k - correction compensates for the redshift shift in the energy band between the emitter and the detector ) . in this table",
    "we provide for completeness spectral fits and fluences for all the bursts observed by batse which were localized after 1997 january .",
    "figure  [ flu_comp ] compares the 202000  kev fluences provided by the batse catalogues and calculated here ; as can be seen , the batse catalogue values are somewhat larger than the fluences resulting from spectral fits .",
    "note that there are host galaxy observations for only 12 of the bursts in this table ; these 12 burst comprise our `` batse redshift sample . ''    as described above , for each burst we need the threshold fluence , the minimum fluence at which batse would have triggered .",
    "this is derived by equating the ratios of the observed and threshold fluences and peak count rates : @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the online batse catalog provides @xmath34 for some bursts , but values are missing for many bursts because of data gaps . for bursts without a catalog value we have estimated @xmath35 from the light curves .",
    "in addition to the energy emitted by the burst ( mostly in gamma - rays ) , significant emission occurs during the first few hours of the afterglow ( mostly in x - rays ) .",
    "we estimate this energy ( excluding the prompt x - ray emission during the burst ) using the observed late ( few hours ) x - ray flux in the 210  kev band and assuming this emission decays as a power law with the index @xmath36 shown in table  [ table ] over the period 100 to @xmath37 seconds after the burst .",
    "the methodology presented in  2 requires @xmath15 , the probability that the burst redshift has a given value .",
    "thus far redshift information has been derived from the associated host galaxies . clearly , if we know the spectroscopic redshift @xmath38 then @xmath39",
    ". however , spectroscopic redshifts are not available for some of the host galaxies . for these host galaxies",
    "we derive a redshift probability distribution with a finite width from their observed single - band magnitudes .",
    "the use of photometry to derive galaxy redshifts has flourished during the past 5 years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "redshifts are now commonly determined to an accuracy of 10% ( e.g. , @xcite ) using multi - band photometry ( usually 4 to 6 bands ) .",
    "multi - band photometry is therefore an economical method of determining redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , most grb hosts have been observed in only a single band ( typically @xmath40 ) .",
    "it may seem futile to try to determine the redshift of a galaxy from a single band .",
    "galaxies span a large range in stellar masses ( i.e. , luminosities ) and therefore galaxies of a given magnitude are found at virtually any redshift ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , since the volume element @xmath41 peaks at around @xmath42 ( for reasonable cosmologies ) and galaxies formed stars at a higher rate at @xmath43 ( and consequently were brighter than at present ) , we expect a high probability that the average galaxy inhabited the @xmath44 region for not too faint magnitudes . here",
    "we use the hubble deep field ( hdf ) to derive a galaxy redshift distribution at different observed magnitudes . with this distribution",
    "we then determine a probability distribution of the host galaxies redshift based on their observed optical magnitudes .",
    "our methodology permits us to consider different redshift distributions corresponding to different models of the host galaxy population ( e.g. , the burst rate is proportional to the galaxy luminosity ) ; we test the hypotheses about the host galaxies by determining whether the model redshift distributions are consistent with the host galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we use only observations from the hdf , the deepest available survey , in order not to complicate our analysis with theoretical prejudices in merging results from different surveys .",
    "note that we only require the distribution of redshifts at a given magnitude , and thus as long as a redshift is determined for every galaxy at a given magnitude in the survey field , the hdf will suffice .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts have thus far not been determined for all the hdf galaxies .",
    "however , the available multi - band photometric redshifts ( accurate to 10% ) will suffice .",
    "we have used the hdf catalog from @xcite , to which the reader is referred for a full description of the sample and the expected accuracy of the photometric redshifts . in fig .",
    "[ hdf ] we show the galaxy redshift distribution as a function of apparent @xmath40 magnitude , where we have transformed the hst f606w magnitudes into cousins @xmath40 magnitudes .",
    "as expected , @xmath45 galaxies are systematically more common at @xmath46 than at higher redshifts .",
    "when normalized , the distributions in fig .  [ hdf ] provide the galaxy redshift probability distributions in a given @xmath40 magnitude band . thus the hdf provides @xmath47@xmath48 is the energy flux corresponding to an r magnitude  from which we derive @xmath49 for those bursts without a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "galaxy surveys weight each detected galaxy equally",
    ". however , the burst rate may not be the same for each galaxy , and thus we have to weight the galaxies in the hdf based on a model of burst occurrence .",
    "to determine how to weight @xmath50 we have to analyze the origin of this probability : it is the normalized product of the comoving volume per redshift , @xmath41 , times the galaxy density at @xmath51 per comoving volume , @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath51 is the luminosity over the band in the burst s frame that redshifted into the @xmath40 band in the observer s frame ; this band varies with redshift .",
    "note that we do not need k - corrections for @xmath51 since the density is for those galaxies which provide us with the observed @xmath48 in the @xmath40-band in our frame .",
    "thus @xmath53 we consider four models .",
    "first , we use @xmath50 as @xmath49 ; every galaxy has an equal probability of hosting a burst .",
    "this is inconsistent with most burst scenarios , but serves as a useful null hypothesis .",
    "second , we assume that the burst rate is proportional to the mass of the galaxy .",
    "this corresponds to a scenario where the burst occurs long after the progenitor was formed , and thus the progenitor population is ( approximately ) proportional to the galaxy s mass . in this case",
    "@xmath49 is @xmath50 weighted by the luminosity the galaxy would have today in the r - band .",
    "thus _ both _ a k- and an e - correction are required , where the e - correction compensates for the evolution in the galaxy s spectrum .",
    "note that these k- and e - corrections are _ not _ applied to @xmath50 but only to the weighting .",
    "thus @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the k - correction which references @xmath51 ( the luminosity in the band at the host galaxy s redshift which is redshifted into today s r - band ) to today s r - band and @xmath56 is the e - correction which maps the r - band luminosity of a galaxy at the host s redshift to the r - band luminosity it would have at present .",
    "third , we assume that the burst rate is proportional to the galaxy s intrinsic luminosity at the time of the burst .",
    "this corresponds to scenarios where the burst occurs very soon after the progenitor forms .",
    "thus , if the luminosity per mass was greater in the past as a result of increased star formation , then the burst rate should also increase .",
    "this is admittedly an oversimplification of a galaxy s evolutionary history .",
    "for this model @xmath57 where , once again , @xmath55 is the k - correction which references @xmath51 ( the luminosity in the band which is redshifted into today s r - band ) to today s r - band .",
    "fourth , we model the star formation rate for a given model by weighting the second model , where the burst rate is proportional to the galaxy mass , by the cosmic redshift - dependent star formation rate .",
    "this rate rises rapidly with redshift to @xmath58 , and then levels off , e.g. citeh+98 .",
    "note that the @xmath49 for each of these different models needs to be renormalized given the model - dependent weightings .",
    "whenever we need to compute a k and/or e  correction in any of the above scenarios , we have used the set of synthetic stellar populations developed in @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate is modelled as a declining exponential , with e - folding ( @xmath59 ) time depending on the morphological type .",
    "in particular , we used the following values : @xmath60 , 3 , 5 and @xmath61 for e / s0 , sab , scd and irr types respectively .",
    "we kept the metallicity fixed at the solar value during the whole evolution of the galaxy and chose @xmath62 as the redshift of formation  starting point of the star formation ",
    "for all galaxies .",
    "this modeling of galaxies is , indeed , overly simplistic , but it is sufficient for our purposes since we do not require to be precise by more than 0.5 magnitudes when computing the k+e corrections .",
    "we can test the different models for the host galaxy population using the bursts with both spectroscopic redshifts and host galaxy r magnitudes .",
    "we compare the likelihoods using the various models .",
    "however , the probability used in these likelihoods is the probability that we would determine the redshift that was indeed observed , not the probability that a host galaxy with a given r magnitude would have a particular redshift . for the telescope which determined the redshift",
    "there are redshift windows in which it would not have been able to make this determination .",
    "for example , for the keck observations the redshift is difficult to determine between @xmath631.3 , when o[ii ] is redshifted out of the spectrum , and @xmath632.5 , when ly@xmath64 is blue shifted in .",
    "thus in the likelihood we should use @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the probability of determining a particular value of the redshift ; however , including the redshift windows applicable to each observation is beyond the scope of this paper . note that by modifying the distribution of host galaxy redshifts , whether observable or not , for a given r magnitude into the distribution of host galaxies which are actually observable , we avoid the selection effect resulting from the easier detectability of bright host galaxies .    the resulting likelihood is @xmath67 we find that @xmath68 for the model where the burst rate is constant per galaxy , @xmath69 when the burst rate is proportional to the galaxy mass , @xmath70 when the burst rate is proportional to the galaxy luminosity , and @xmath71 for the model where the burst rate is proportional to the product of the galaxy mass and the cosmic star formation rate .",
    "thus the third model is preferred ; we will use the corresponding @xmath49 in adding the four bursts with only host galaxy r magnitudes to the sample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we first estimate the characteristic isotropic gamma - ray energy ( @xmath27 ) and its spread ( @xmath14 ) in the 202000 kev band . the result is presented in figure  [ tot ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the likelihood contour corresponding to 70% confidence using only the 8 grbs with spectroscopic redshifts , while the bottom panel shows the same contour level but with the additional 4 grbs with statistical redshifts .",
    "therefore , the preferred value for @xmath72 is @xmath73 erg with @xmath5 .",
    "note that there is no need to k - correct the @xmath8-ray data in this case because the 202000 kev band already contains most of the energy of the grb .",
    "similarly we derive the peak luminosity @xmath74 in the 50300 kev band . in this case",
    "we apply a k - correction to the data using the spectral fits described in table  [ table ] .",
    "figure  [ likpeak ] shows the 70% confidence contour plot using all the grbs in our sample .",
    "we find @xmath75 erg s@xmath2 with @xmath76 .",
    "finally , we find the average energy of the x - ray afterglow . to homogenize the observations , we integrate the x - ray emission between 100 and 10@xmath77 seconds after the burst using the best fitting power law to the observed light curve ( slopes for the different light curves",
    "are given in table  [ table ] ) .",
    "figure  [ xafter ] shows the @xmath78 contour plot when the 7 grbs with x - ray light curves are considered .",
    "here we find that @xmath79 erg and @xmath80 .",
    "we have determined the distributions of the total burst energy , the peak burst luminosity and the total x - ray afterglow energy for a sample of bursts with either spectroscopic redshifts or host galaxy r magnitudes .",
    "these distributions reflect the physics of the burst process .",
    "we have found that the best model for the burst rate is proportional to the host galaxy luminosity and not to the host size .",
    "this result provides further support to the proposition that the bursts are associated with star formation .",
    "star forming galaxies are brighter than other galaxies with the same size .",
    "it seems that @xmath72 is slightly broader than @xmath81 , but within the 70% confidence both distributions are compatible with having the same width .",
    "however , inspection of the data points shows that x - ray energy of one burst  grb970508significantly broadens the x - ray distribution ; otherwise the x - ray distribution would be _ much _ narrower than the gamma - ray distribution .",
    "thus we must conclude that the data are insufficient to determine conclusively the width of the luminosity functions , although there is a trend for the x - ray distribution to be narrower than the @xmath82 distribution .",
    "the ratio between the widths of the gamma - ray and the x - ray luminosity functions is particularly important as far as the physics of the physical processes within the `` inner engine . ''",
    "a ratio of order unity suggests that the `` inner engine '' emits a rather uniform flow with no significant angular variation on an angular scale of few degrees ( corresponding to the width seen several hours after the burst while the x - rays are emitted ) . on the other hand , a large @xmath83 would support the `` patchy shell '' model@xcite which predicts that the gamma - ray energy emitted during the grb has a significantly wider distribution than the x - ray energy emitted during the afterglow , @xmath84 . in this model , there are mass fluctuations on the shells whose collisions produce the internal shocks which subsequently radiate the observed gamma - rays .",
    "thus the gamma - ray intensity should vary greatly with the observer s angle . on the other hand , the afterglow results from the decelerating external shock , and the observer sees a much larger solid angle of the relativistic outflow in the afterglow than in the burst itself .",
    "thus there are smaller fluctuations in the afterglow intensity with observer angle",
    ". finally @xmath85 would be indicative of extremely large variations ( from one burst to the other ) in the circumstellar matter surrounding the grbs .",
    "the data are sufficient to rule out this third possibility , but can not distinguish with confidence between the first and second , although the trend is toward favoring the `` patchy shell '' model .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the energy distribution determined for the whole grb sample .",
    "@xcite finds for a broken power law distribution that the energy of the break is @xmath86 ergs , which is very close to our average energy .",
    "however , the average energy in schmidt s distribution is a factor of @xmath87 smaller than this break energy .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that afterglow can be observed only for the more luminous bursts for which we can determine an exact position .",
    "finally we note that we have presented here a new methodology for obtaining the luminosity function of a sample for which the magnitude is known but there are no redshift measurements .",
    "this method can be best applied to other populations that like grbs have an intrinsically wide luminosity function . while a galaxy s optical magnitude does not provide a reliable distance measure for a single object , is",
    "should be sufficiently reliable when analyzing a large sample .",
    "this method should be tested on other samples in the future .",
    "this methodology can be used wherever burst distances and energies are required .",
    "for example , a burst sample with known distances is required to calibrate proposed correlations between the burst energy and the frequency ",
    "dependent lags in pulses @xcite or light - curve variability @xcite .",
