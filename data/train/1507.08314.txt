    "the question of how typical massive stars explode as core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) has plagued theorists for decades @xcite . the collapse and bounce of the fe core of a massive star launches a strong shock wave ; however , this prompt shock quickly stalls due to electron capture , nuclear dissociation , and neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "thus the explosive shock is momentarily aborted producing a stalled accretion shock .",
    "if the shock remains stalled , the explosion will fail and the proto - neutron star will continue to accrete , eventually collapsing to a black hole @xcite .",
    "but we know stars explode and leave neutron stars a large fraction of the time @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fundamental question in core - collapse theory is how does a ccsn transition from a stalled accretion shock phase into a phase of runaway shock expansion that explodes the star ? in this paper , we derive an integral condition that divides stalled - shock solutions from explosive solutions .",
    "the prevailing view is that neutrinos help to reinvigorate the stalled shock , leading to runaway expansion @xcite .",
    "a large neutrino flux cools the proto - neutron star and surrounding regions ; about half of that luminosity comes from neutrinos diffusing out of the natal proto - neutron star and the rest is emitted directly as accretion luminosity by the accreting stellar material .",
    "a fraction of these neutrinos recapture just below the shock , depositing enough energy in the post - shock mantle to reinvigorate the stalled accretion shock and initiate explosion .",
    "however , when this picture is simulated in numerical models with significant ( though perhaps not sufficient ) detail , the final and most important element  explosion  remains elusive or , at best , inconsistent with observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , a major challenge for simulators has been to understand the various physical effects that influence the unsatisfactory outcomes , all in the context of enormously complicated and expensive simulations .",
    "this process of interpretation has inevitably relied on some easily understood models that one hopes encapsulate the important physics of the problem .    in that context ,",
    "perhaps the most impactful model was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they proposed that the essence of the core - collapse problem is captured by considering a simple boundary value problem .",
    "the inner boundary is set at the proto - neutron star `` surface , '' defined by a neutrino optical depth of 2/3 , where a temperature and therefore luminosity is specified .",
    "the outer boundary is at the stalled shock , where the post shock solutions match the nearly free - falling stellar material upstream via the jump conditions .",
    "@xcite proceeded to show that hydrodynamic solutions with a stationary shock only exist below a critical luminosity and accretion rate curve . above this curve ,",
    "no stalled shock solutions exist .",
    "they speculated that this critical curve , separating stationary from non - stationary solutions , also represents a critical curve for explosion ; non - stationary solutions are explosive .",
    "subsequent work with parameterized 1d , 2d , and 3d core - collapse models have confirmed qualitatively that such a critical curve exists @xcite , but its precise location in parameter space depends on other details of the problem including , e.g. , the structure of the progenitor , hampering the use of the critical curve in practice @xcite .    nonetheless , the idea of criticality has framed much of the discussion surrounding the simulation results and has motivated the introduction of heuristic and approximate measures of `` nearness to explosion . '' for example , many have suggested that the ratio of the advection timescale to heating timescale captures an important aspect of the problem , with values @xmath111 conducive to explosion @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue that their `` antesonic '' condition represents a critical condition for explosion .",
    "both conditions , however , suffer the same afflictions ; they lack precise critical values and they both run away only after explosion commences .",
    "these shortcomings have led to the practice of measuring these parameters as a function of simulation time and deciding on `` critical values '' _ ex post facto _ @xcite .",
    "clearly , this is unsatisfactory and leads to little more insight than simply identifying explosions with runaway shock radii . in principle , these critical values may even be reached precisely _ because _ of explosion ; the relationship may be symptomatic rather than causal .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the idea of criticality , generalizing the critical - curve concept to a critical hypersurface that depends on all of the relevant parameters .",
    "we show that for a fixed set of parameters , there is a family of possible solutions .",
    "depending upon the parameters , each family falls into one of two categories . in one category ,",
    "the family consists of solutions with negative , zero , or positive shock velocity .",
    "for such a family , the zero - shock - velocity solution is the quasi - stationary solution . in the second category ,",
    "all possible solutions have positive shock velocity .",
    "these two categories are divided by a critical hypersurface , which may be expressed as a single dimensionless parameter .",
    "this new condition for explosion , the critical hypersurface and associated dimensionless parameter , proves to be a useful diagnostic for core - collapse simulations . for one ,",
    "we empirically show that the hypersurface corresponds to the transition to explosion in parameterized one dimensional ccsn models .",
    "further , the associated dimensionless parameter reliably and quantitatively indicates when explosions commence . since we derive the parameter directly from the equations of hydrodynamics , its usefulness is not limited by the ad hoc calibrations of other popular measures . finally ,",
    "when combined with semi - analytic models , we show that our single parameter yields an accurate and reliable measure of nearness to explosion .    for your convenience ,",
    "the structure of this manuscript is as follows . in section  [ sec : boundaryproblem ] , we review the boundary value problem that describes the core - collapse problem @xcite and identify the important parameters of the problem . with this framework , and the proposition that @xmath12 corresponds to explosion",
    ", we derive the integral condition for explosion in section  [ sec : integralcondition ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : validate ] , we validate the integral conditions for explosion with 1d parameterized simulations . in section  [ sec : explodability ] , we use the integral condition to investigate the family of steady - state solutions and propose an explosion diagnostic .",
    "then in section  [ sec : comparison ] , we compare the reliability of the integral condition explosion diagnostic with other popular explosion measures , finding that the integral condition outperforms them all .",
    "finally , for a brief summary of the conclusions , cautionary notes , and future prospects , see section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the fundamental question of core - collapse theory is how does the stalled accretion shock phase transition into a dynamic explosion ?",
    "in other words , what are the conditions for which the shock velocity , @xmath13 , is persistently greater than zero ? while the shock is stationary , the steady - state assumption is quite good . under this assumption , the entire region below the shock may be treated as a boundary value problem @xcite .",
    "the upper boundary is set by the properties of the nearly free falling stellar material and the jump conditions at the shock , while the lower boundary is the surface of the neutron star .",
    "later , we derive a condition in which there are no more @xmath14 solutions , and the only solutions left are those in which @xmath0 .",
    "to understand when the steady - state solutions are no longer viable , we first must understand the stalled accretion shock solution and the important parameters of the problem .",
    "to begin , the governing conservation equations are @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 = \\rho { \\bf v } \\cdot \\nabla \\phi + \\rho q \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the mass density , @xmath19 is the velocity , @xmath20 is the pressure , @xmath21 is the gravitational potential , @xmath22 is the internal plus kinetic specific energy , and @xmath23 is the specific enthalpy . in this paper , we approximate the heating and cooling , @xmath24 as @xmath25 the first term is a model in which we treat the neutrino heating as if all neutrinos are emitted from the proto - neutron star `` surface '' with a luminosity of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 is the opacity for absorbing neutrinos in the region above the `` surface '' , which is proportional to @xmath28 . in this paper ,",
    "the surface of the proto - neutron star is given by @xmath29 , which implicitly defines the proto - neutron star radius ( @xmath30 ) as the neutrinospheric radius .",
    "in practice , we find that this corresponds to a density of @xmath31 g / cc .",
    "the second term is the neutrino cooling due to thermal weak interactions @xcite .    in a quasi - steady state ,",
    "the time - derivative terms are small and the problem is well - approximated by setting these terms to zero .",
    "the solution to the resulting boundary value problem describes the conditions of the flow between the proto - neutron star surface and the bounding stalled shock in terms of the important parameters of the problem : @xmath26 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 , @xmath33 ( proto - neutron star mass ) , and @xmath34 ( accretion rate )",
    ". see figure  [ fig : boundaryvalue ] for a schematic of the boundary value problem and the most important parameters of the problem .",
    "we reduce the core - collapse problem to a set of integral conditions and show that this leads to a critical condition for explosions . before we derive the integral conditions ,",
    "let us motivate why we consider the integral equations at all . usually , the governing equations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : mass]-[eq : energy ] ) are presented in differential form , but one could just as easily present them in integral form .",
    "the two forms represent exactly the same information .",
    "one s choice is determined by the ease and method for finding solutions .",
    "for example , it is typically easier to work with the differential form when one needs to find numerical solutions , but if one seeks an analytic solution , the integral equations can be easier to use .",
    "for example , in finding the motion of a body in a potential field , one may solve the equations of motion , or one may use the integral condition , conservation of energy .",
    "we argue that the integral equations provide an easier route to deriving a unified condition for explosions . because the shock is a crucial component of the core - collapse problem , when we derive the explosion condition we embark in a route that is similar to deriving the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions .",
    "the route to deriving these jump conditions involves using the integral equations in the context of a moving boundary , the shock .      as in deriving the rankine - hugoniot conditions , we start with the conservation equations and the reynolds transport theorem . consider a generic conserved quantity , @xmath24 , which could represent a mass density , momentum density , energy density , etc .",
    "generically , one may define the total conserved quantity in region @xmath35 as @xmath36 and the time - rate - of - change of this conserved quantity is @xmath37 .",
    "the reynolds transport theorem decomposes this time - rate - of - change into an eulerian component and a component that accounts for the motion of the boundaries of region @xmath35 : @xmath38 with @xmath39 the surface of this domain , @xmath40 the surface element , and @xmath41 the velocity of the surface . to make use of the reynolds transport theorem",
    ", we need an expression for the eulerian time derivative , @xmath42 .",
    "the conservation equation provides such an expression .",
    "a general conservation equation has the following form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the flux of @xmath24 , and @xmath45 is a source / sink of @xmath24 . with these two equations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : rtt ]  &  [ eq : conservation ] ) we may now proceed to derive the integral conditions .    to construct the appropriate boundary value problem , we must choose the appropriate boundaries .",
    "we consider a boundary value problem where the lower boundary is at @xmath46 and the upper boundary is at @xmath47 .",
    "the overall problem is divided into two domains , with a different solution in each domain .",
    "the pre - shock solution is in the domain @xmath48 $ ] , the post - shock solution is in the domain @xmath49 , and the two solutions are joined by the rankine hugoniot jump conditions at @xmath50 . with the boundaries defined , we now define the integral equations .",
    "first , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , and since the boundaries are constant in time , we have @xmath51 next , we rewrite the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rightintegral ] ) to explicitly express the shock radius .",
    "in order to do this , we must divide the integral into two regions , above and below the shock , and we use the reynolds transport equation ( eq .  [ eq : rtt ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath52    in the core - collapse problem , the pre - shock solution is nearly in free - fall and can be solved analytically .",
    "therefore , the problem reduces to finding the post - shock solution subject to the lower boundary , the surface of the ns , and the upper boundary , the shock .",
    "now , we take the limit that @xmath47 approaches @xmath50 . in this limit , we have the following simplifications @xmath53 which , when inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullintegral ] ) , results in the simpler integral equation : @xmath54 by plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : leftintegral ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rightintegral ] ) , we arrive at the general integral equation @xmath55 note that if we take the limit that @xmath46 approaches @xmath56 from below , this reduces to the shock jump conditions , but if we retain @xmath46 at the neutron star surface , we have the general integral equations describing the post shock structure .",
    "if we assume steady - state , then this reduces to @xmath57 finally , if we assume that explosion occurs when @xmath58 , then the generic integral condition for explosion becomes @xmath59      next , we use the momentum equation ( [ eq : momentum ] ) and energy equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) to suggest dimensionless integral conditions for explosion . substituting the corresponding fluxes and source terms for the momentum and energy equations into the generic integral condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : genericcondition ] ) , leads to two integral conditions @xmath60 and @xmath61    in the context of the core - collapse problem , we can further simplify these integral conditions .",
    "first , let s set the inner boundary to the surface of the neutron star @xmath62 , and the outer boundary is the shock position , @xmath63 .",
    "second , the material accreting onto the shock has a bernoulli parameter of approximately zero , @xmath64 .",
    "third , the mass , @xmath65 , is dominated by the neutron star mass , @xmath33 .",
    "fourth , the kinetic energy at the neutron star surface is much less than the enthalpy or gravitational potential , @xmath66 .",
    "fifth , the pre - shock enthalpy and pressure are much smaller than the pre - shock kinetic energy . under these assumptions ,",
    "the conditions for @xmath0 become @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "we rewrite the momentum condition as @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "finally , we have our integral conditions for explosion : @xmath76 ( eq .  [ eq : psigt0 ] ) is derived from the momentum equation , and @xmath77 ( eq .  [ eq : sigmagt0 ] ) is derived from the energy equation .",
    "later , we use @xmath6 to propose an explosion diagnostic for core - collapse simulations , but first we verify in this section that @xmath2 and @xmath78 during the stalled shock phase and that @xmath1 and @xmath79 during explosion . to perform these validating tests , we calculate @xmath6 and @xmath80 in 1d parameterized simulations .    the 1d simulations are calculated using a new code * cufe * , which will be described fully in @xcite . * cufe * solves the equations of hydrodynamics eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mass]-[eq : energy ] ) using higher - order godunov techniques . the grid is logically cartesian but employs a generalized metric allowing for a variety of mesh geometries . for this study , we use spherical coordinates .",
    "the progenitor model is the 12 m@xmath81 model of @xcite , the equation of state ( eos ) includes effects of dense nucleons around and above nuclear densities , nuclear statistical equilibrium , electrons , positrons , and photons @xcite . for the neutrino heating and cooling we use the approximate local descriptions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recall that there are five important parameters that describe the steady - state accretion solutions : @xmath26 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath30 , and @xmath82 .",
    "two of these , @xmath26 and @xmath32 , we set in the parameterized simulations ; the rest we calculate self consistently given the equations of hydrodynamics , the progenitor structure , and the equation of state .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : sim_params ] shows the time evolution of @xmath83 , @xmath30 , and @xmath82 ; we highlight the post - bounce phase of a model that does not explode .",
    "@xmath82 starts quite high , well above 1 m@xmath81/s , but then drops down to @xmath84 0.2 m@xmath81/s near the end of the simulation . at around 500 ms",
    "after bounce @xmath82 has a significant drop , which is a result of a density shelf advecting through the shock . throughout this paper",
    ", you will notice that this significant drop in @xmath82 gets imprinted on many of the explosion diagnostics , including the shock radius vs. time in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : sim_params ] .",
    "to sample a range of explosion timescales , we vary the light bulb neutrino luminosity , @xmath26 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : sim_params ] shows the resulting shock radii vs. time labeled by @xmath26 in units of @xmath85 erg / s . in all models , the shock forms at 153",
    "ms after the start of the simulations and quickly stalls between @xmath84150 to @xmath84200 km .",
    "the general trend is that the higher luminosity models explode earlier than lower luminosity models .",
    "the lowest luminosity model does not explode at all .",
    "however , it does experience a significant outward adjustment and oscillation of the shock as @xmath82 drops significantly around 500 ms after bounce .",
    "the @xmath86 & 3.0 models explode during the advection of the density shelf .",
    "an obvious feature present in the shock radius evolution plot are the shock radius oscillations .",
    "they are often present in 1d simulations near explosion @xcite , and @xcite suggests that they might be related to the advective - acoustic feedback loop that is responsible for the sasi in multi - d simulations .    for each of the models , we calculate @xmath6 and @xmath80 directly from the simulations ; see figures  [ fig : cond_sim_psi ]  &  [ fig : cond_sim_sigma ] for the results .",
    "@xmath6 is indeed zero during the steady - state phase and @xmath1 during explosion .",
    "note , however , @xmath6 never achieves a value greater than about 0.02 .",
    "this indicates how subtle the core - collapse problem is ; even during the strongest explosion , the profile deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium only by about 2% .",
    "regardless , the fact that simulations roughly validate @xmath76 implies that @xmath6 is a good dimensionless explosion diagnostic .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath80 is also roughly zero during the steady - accretion phase and greater than 0 during explosion .",
    "however , the oscillations of the shock are much more apparent in the behavior of @xmath80 compared to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath6 is practically a better condition for explosion .",
    "the fact that @xmath87 during explosion ( figure  [ fig : cond_sim_psi ] ) suggests that @xmath6 has the potential to be a good explosion diagnostic .",
    "however , just calculating @xmath6 from the simulations is not the most useful condition ; @xmath6 remains zero during the non - exploding phase and it only deviates from zero while the simulation is exploding . that behavior is not a very useful explosion diagnostic , and one might as well just use the shock radius .",
    "in fact , most explosion `` conditions '' or `` diagnostics '' to date have this problem .",
    "they do not provide a nearness - to - explosion condition .",
    "what we need is a way to translate the @xmath76 condition into a useful nearness - to - explosion condition .",
    "fortunately , @xmath6 lends itself to such an explosion diagnostic .    our strategy for developing",
    "a nearness - to - explosion condition is to extract @xmath26 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 , @xmath33 , and @xmath82 from the simulations and calculate the steady - state solutions for each set of parameters . for a given set of parameters",
    ", there is a family of solutions to the steady - state equations , each with a different shock radius .",
    "each solution has a value for @xmath6 which may be @xmath88 , @xmath89 , or @xmath90 , which correspond to solutions with @xmath91 , @xmath14 , or @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 ( @xmath2 ) solution is a quasi - equilibrium solution .",
    "we will show that for each family of solutions , there is always a minimum @xmath6 , which we denote @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath8 , then @xmath93 solutions exists .",
    "however , when @xmath9 , the only solutions that exist have @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we propose that @xmath7 is an excellent explosion diagnostic providing a nearness - to - explosion condition . figures  [ fig : psi_xs_lum ]  &  [ fig : sol_diag ] illustrate these points .",
    "having outlined the strategy , we now provide the specifics in calculating @xmath7 .",
    "we begin with the steady - state equations @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 to solve these equations , we need an equation of state to relate p in terms of @xmath97 and @xmath18 , and we need boundary conditions . for the region that we consider , above the neutrinosphere and below the shock ,",
    "the dominant contributors to the eos are neutrons , protons , helium nuclei ( @xmath98 ) , positrons , electrons , and photons .",
    "we treat the neutrons , protons , and @xmath98s as an ideal non - relativistic gas ; the positrons , electrons , and photons constitute the relativistic part of the plasma , and we consider the positrons and electrons in an arbitrary degeneracy . to calculate the relative abundances of neutrons , protons , and @xmath98s , we assume nuclear statistical equilibrium for these three components and use the saha equation to calculate their abundances .",
    "see appendix  [ app : eos ] for the details in calculating the eos and the abundances .    in the spirit of @xcite and others @xcite ,",
    "we solve the steady - state equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : steadymass]-[eq : steadyene ] ) , using the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for a stalled shock .",
    "the jump conditions give the post - shock state ( subscript @xmath45 ) in terms of the pre - shock state ( subscript @xmath99 ) : @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the pre - shock state , we make the following assumptions that enable analytic solutions of the conditions .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath103 is a constant .",
    "second , we assume that the star is accreting onto the shock at a large fraction of free fall , so the pre - shock speed is given by @xmath104 .",
    "third , we assume that the pre - shock bernoulli constant is roughly zero , @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we assume a gamma - law relationship for the pre - shock pressure , internal energy , and density : @xmath106 . under these assumptions",
    ", the pre - shock pressure is @xmath107 specifying @xmath82 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath3 then sets the boundary conditions at the shock . when @xcite first introduced the critical luminosity , they specified one more boundary condition at the base : @xmath110 .",
    "this extra condition enables one to self - consistently solve for the shock radius that permits a steady - state - stalled - shock solution .",
    "@xcite noted that the density at the radius where @xmath111 is almost always the same , so one can easily replace the @xmath112 condition by specifying a specific density at the neutrinosphere , or neutron star surface .",
    "we take a slightly different approach in this paper .",
    "first of all , we use the 1d simulations to inform the values for @xmath82 , @xmath33 , @xmath30 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , and of course , we set @xmath26 and @xmath32 to the values used for the 1d parameterized simulations",
    ". then we find solutions to the steady - state equations for a wide range of shock radii .",
    "these solutions represent a family of solutions at different @xmath3 but all with the same parameters . for each solution and associated @xmath3",
    ", we evaluate @xmath6 , where we follow @xcite and set @xmath113 g / cc .",
    "since @xmath6 is proportional to the shock velocity , @xmath6 naturally shows which solutions have @xmath91 , @xmath114 , or @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath14 solution corresponds to the steady - state - stalled - shock solution .",
    "figure  [ fig : psi_xs_lum ] shows the outcome of this process .",
    "each line corresponds to a specific set of parameters and one family of solutions . for clarity",
    ", we only vary @xmath26 between different families of solutions . for low values of @xmath26 , all three solutions ( @xmath0 , @xmath14 , and @xmath91 )",
    "are possible . for low @xmath3 , @xmath1 implying that @xmath0 and the shock would move outward . for larger @xmath3 , @xmath115 so @xmath91 and the shock would tend to move inward . in between , at a very specific shock radius , there is a solution which has @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "this solution represents an equilibrium solution .",
    "while solutions far from equilibrium are not steady and therefore are poorly represented by the steady - state equations , our approach does not rely on the quantitative accuracy of this representation . for a visual aide of these concepts see figure  [ fig : sol_diag ] .",
    "note that for large values of @xmath26 there are no solutions for which @xmath8 . in those cases ,",
    "all solutions correspond to @xmath0 .",
    "there is a very specific set of parameters for which @xmath10 .",
    "the locus of such parameters defines a critical hypersurface that generalizes but encompasses the critical neutrino luminosity condition of @xcite ( see section  [ sec : comparison ] for more on this ) .    to validate that @xmath7 satisfies the desired qualities of an explosion diagnostic , we plot @xmath7 in figure  [ fig : nearness ] for the 1d parameterized simulations .",
    "the parameter that we set by hand in each simulation is @xmath26 and @xmath32 ; we keep @xmath32 set at 4 mev , and vary @xmath26 . at each time , we extract the other important parameters @xmath33 , @xmath30 , and @xmath82 , which are calculated self - consistently in the simulation .",
    "we then calculate the family of steady - state solutions for that set of parameters and find the value of @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nearness ] shows that @xmath7 has the desired qualities of an explosion condition . before explosion @xmath8 and during explosion @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we suggest that the value of @xmath7 before explosion provides a useful metric for how far away the simulation is from explosion .",
    "in this section , we quickly compare the integral explosion diagnostic , @xmath9 with three other conditions : the critical neutrino luminosity condition @xcite , a timescale ratio condition @xcite , and the antesonic condition @xcite . in this manuscript",
    ", we mostly compare the effectiveness of these conditions with the integral condition ; in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we show that one can actually derive all three conditions from the integral condition by making various further approximations . for now , we simply compare the conditions .    of these three",
    ", the most closely related condition is the critical luminosity condition of @xcite .",
    "in fact , a primary motivation in deriving the integral condition is to derive a condition that shows that the solutions above the critical neutrino luminosity curve correspond to @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : integralcondition ] , we derived the integral condition for @xmath0 , and now , in figure  [ fig : lcrit ] , we show that this same integral condition reproduces the critical neutrino luminosity curve of @xcite .",
    "to reproduce the critical neutrino luminosity curve in figure  [ fig : lcrit ] , we first fix three of the five important parameters of the problem , @xmath30 , @xmath33 , and @xmath32 . in other words , we restrict the dimensionality of the integral condition to the @xmath26-@xmath82 plane . then we find the solutions to the steady - sate equations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : steadymass]-[eq : steadyene ] ) and select the solutions in the @xmath26-@xmath82 plane that have @xmath10 .",
    "the locus of these specific solutions form the solid curve that we show in figure  [ fig : lcrit ] . above this curve ,",
    "@xmath9 and therefore all solutions have @xmath0 . below this curve @xmath8 , and therefore a steady - state stalled shock solution exists .",
    "this curve is exactly the same critical neutrino luminosity curve that @xcite and others have derived .",
    "the difference is in the way that it is derived .",
    "@xcite solved the steady - state equations looking for solutions for which the shock and @xmath111 conditions are satisfied .",
    "there is no statement about the behavior of @xmath13 above the curve . rather than highlighting @xmath112 ,",
    "we instead use the @xmath10 condition , so one readily sees that @xmath0 above the curve .    besides showing that @xmath0 above the critical neutrino luminosity curve",
    ", we also show that @xmath9 is a more general explosion condition than the critical neutrino luminosity .",
    "in fact , in the important parameters , @xmath10 represents a critical hypersurface , and the critical neutrino luminosity curve is a projection of this more general critical condition . remarkably , this critical hypersurface is represented by one dimensionless condition @xmath9 .",
    "another common class of explosion metrics are the timescale ratios in which one compares an advection timescale ( @xmath116 ) to a heating timescale ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "roughly , neutrino heating might be expected to significantly modify the internal energy of the accreting material only when @xmath118 .",
    "based on this , many have used the ratio @xmath119 as a diagnostic to indicate how close a model is to explosion for a given snapshot @xcite .",
    "while this may seem sensible at face value , the timescale ratio arguments all neglect important aspects of the ccsn problem  cooling , for example .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the turbulent dynamics of multi - d lead to longer advection times on average , speculating that this may be an important effect vis -  - vis 1d vs. multi - d .",
    "there are many approximate definitions of @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "early definitions of the advection time include @xmath120 , but the most recent definitions use the mass in the gain region and the mass accretion rate @xmath121 for the rest of this paper , we adopt this most recent definition . for the heating timescale ,",
    "the generic approach is to compare a total energy with an integrated heating rate @xmath122 .",
    "generically , many define the heating rate as @xmath123 .",
    "the total energy has several definitions , and since none are derived from a firm explosion condition , all are arbitrary .",
    "we highlight and use one condition ; we consider the total internal energy in the gain region @xmath124 .",
    "both the choice for the energy scale and the region are completely arbitrary and not derived from an actual explosion condition . in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we will derive a timescale ratio condition from the integral condition , but for now we just compare to the arbitrary definitions from the past .",
    "for example , the integral energy explosion condition that we derive in section  [ sec : integralcondition ] ( eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmagt0 ] ) highlights that it is the bernoulli parameter that is important and that one should consider the entire region between the neutrino sphere and the shock .",
    "traditionally neither of these have been considered .",
    "instead , one often guessed at a typical energy scale and a region that is important .",
    "so we pick one example , the total internal energy in the gain region .",
    "@xmath125    figure  [ fig : timescales ] compares our derived integral condition , @xmath7 , with the approximate timescale ratio condition , @xmath126 .",
    "as one might expect , the rough heuristic condition does not perform as well at predicting explosions .",
    "indeed , @xmath126 is @xmath127 before explosion and increases dramatically after explosion .",
    "however , the ratio has serious problems as an explosion metric .",
    "for example , one might be tempted to conclude that the sharp upward trend in this ratio would be a good indicator of explosion . however",
    ", careful inspection of @xmath126 and the shock radii in figure  [ fig : timescales ] shows that @xmath126 just follows @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , using @xmath126 is not much more useful than @xmath3 .",
    "one might be tempted to use the simulations to calibrate a `` critical '' value for @xmath126 .",
    "however , the results in the literature as well as those shown here indicate that no such `` critical '' value exists @xcite .",
    "simple comparison between the definition of @xmath126 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : tadv ]  &  [ eq : theat ] ) and the integral conditions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : sigmagt0 ]  &  [ eq : psigt0 ] ) shows that much is missing from the @xmath126 condition , so its shortcomings should be unsurprising .",
    "the final comparison is between @xmath7 and the antesonic condition of @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : antesonic ] .",
    "similar to our motivation , @xcite were motivated to explain the origin of the critical luminosity curve and possibly derive a more generic condition .",
    "they took a slightly different tack . @xcite considered the family of accretion and wind solutions and hypothesized that explosion occurs at the intersection between steady - state accretion solutions and steady - state wind solutions . by considering isothermal profiles",
    ", they were able to define an analytic condition that divides these solutions .",
    "for @xmath128 , only wind solutions are possible , which they attribute to the transition between steady - state accretion and explosion . given the great deal of neutrino heating and neutrino cooling , the post - shock profile is certainly not isothermal .",
    "therefore , they were unable to derive a similar analytic condition in a more realistic ccsn context",
    ". instead , they solved the steady - state equations and empirically searched for a similar condition that would be appropriate for the core - collapse case .",
    "the resulting explosion condition that they propose is the antesonic condition , @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denotes the maximum in between the ns and the shock .",
    "empirically , our 1d simulations indicate that a value of @xmath840.19 is about right .",
    "however , in multi - d simulations , @xcite and @xcite found a much higher value of @xmath840.3 .",
    "if the antesonic is correct in spirit , it clearly is missing some important physics . to use the antesonic condition in practice",
    ", one must measure the `` critical '' condition in simulations _ ex post facto_. the antesonic condition which is analytically derived in the isothermal case and empirically derived in the non - isothermal case is by no means perfect , but figure  [ fig : antesonic ] shows that it fairs a little better than the timescale ratio condition .",
    "while the antesonic conditions fair much better than the timescale ratio at predicting explosion , it still remains less favorable compared to the integral condition ( middle panel of figure  [ fig : antesonic ] ) .",
    "for one , like the timescale ratio , the dramatic upward trend in the antesonic feature which might be attributed to explosion actually occurs well after explosion ; so one can rule out using the upward trend as an explosion diagnostic .",
    "one of the useful features of the integral condition , @xmath9 is that one can tell even before explosion that a model is unlikely to explode .",
    "there are two features that enable this : 1 ) the closeness of @xmath7 to zero , and 2 ) the trend toward or away from zero ; for example , @xmath7 for the @xmath131 model marches toward explosion while @xmath7 for the @xmath132 model marches away from explosion .",
    "similar to point 1 ) for the integral condition , the antesonic condition is indeed closer to the `` critical '' value before explosion .",
    "however , even the antesonic diagnostic for the @xmath133 marches toward the `` critical '' value even though it never explodes .",
    "furthermore , the antesonic diagnostic overshoots the `` critical '' value by @xmath8410% of the `` critical '' value .",
    "this may seem like a triumph of estimating the `` critical '' value , but the dynamic range of the antesonic diagnostic is only @xmath8420% of the `` critical '' value , making the estimate only @xmath8450% accurate when considering the dynamic range of the antesonic diagnostic .",
    "for many years , the critical neutrino luminosity curve has been the most impactful model for understanding successful explosion conditions .",
    "however , no one had demonstrated that the solutions above the curve are explosive , nor had anyone successfully used the critical neutrino luminosity as an explosion diagnostic for core - collapse simulations . in this manuscript , we do both .",
    "when we began this project , our primary goal was to merely show that the solutions above the critical neutrino luminosity curve are explosive .",
    "we have partially done so by deriving an integral condition , @xmath134 , for @xmath58 and showing that the solutions above the critical neutrino luminosity curve have @xmath0 . along the way to deriving this integral condition , we discovered that the neutrino luminosity curve is a projection of a more general critical hypersurface .",
    "most strikingly , that critical hypersurface is represented by a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath134 , and it promises to be a useful explosion diagnostic for core - collapse simulations .    in deriving the integral condition @xmath76 , we make two simple but profound approximations : 1 ) we consider steady - state solutions and 2 ) @xmath0 corresponds to explosion . with these two approximations , we derive an integral condition for @xmath58 and recast it in a dimensionless form , @xmath76 .",
    "we verify this integral condition using 1d parameterized simulations and find that during the stalled shock phase @xmath135 and during explosion @xmath1 . though the comparisons with simulations successfully verify the integral condition",
    ", they also demonstrate that just calculating @xmath6 from the simulations is not a useful explosion diagnostic . because the simulations always find a stalled shock solution before explosion , @xmath6 is always zero before explosion .",
    "such a diagnostic fails to indicate a distance to explosion . if , on the other hand , we extract the important parameters from the simulations and calculate all of the possible steady - state solutions , a better diagnostic emerges .",
    "the steady state solutions fall into one of two broad categories : in one category , a stalled - shock solution exists , and in the other , only @xmath0 solutions exist . to understand the origin of these categories",
    ", one must first understand that there are five important parameters that characterize each steady - state solution : @xmath26 ( neutrino luminosity ) , @xmath32 ( neutrino temperature ) , @xmath30 ( proto - neutron star radius ) , @xmath33 ( proto - neutron star mass ) , and @xmath34 ( accretion rate ) . for a fixed set of parameters ,",
    "there are a family of solutions , and each solution in this family has a different value of @xmath6 . in general , @xmath6 may be negative , zero , or positive and because @xmath136 each solution may have @xmath91 , @xmath14 , or @xmath0 . if a @xmath14 solutions exists , it represents the preferred quasi - equilibrium solution .",
    "generically , for each family of solutions , there is a minimum @xmath6 which we denote @xmath7 , and it is this parameter that determines whether a solution belongs to the stalled - shock category or the explosive category . if @xmath8 , then the family of solutions has solutions with @xmath137 , @xmath14 , and @xmath0 with the @xmath14 being the preferred quasi - equilibrium solution .",
    "if on the other hand , @xmath9 , then only @xmath0 solutions exist .",
    "if we attribute @xmath0 to explosions , then @xmath7 is a useful explosion diagnostic .",
    "we calculate @xmath7 for several 1d parameterized simulations ( see figure  [ fig : nearness ] ) and find that the time evolution of @xmath7 makes an excellent explosion diagnostic . from the beginning of the simulation , one can tell if a simulation is near explosion or not . for those that are near explosion , @xmath7 tends to march toward explosion throughout much of the simulation .",
    "the model that does not explode shows a general evolution of @xmath7 away from explosion . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we plan to study @xmath7 in self - consistent neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations to see if these promising behaviors remain .    in section  [ sec : comparison ] and figures  [ fig : timescales ]  &  [ fig : antesonic ]",
    ", we compare this new integral condition with explosion conditions that have been previously defined .",
    "specifically , we compare @xmath9 to a timescale ratio condition and the antesonic condition .",
    "in contrast to the integral condition , the @xmath126 condition is heuristic , only good to order unity , shows no obvious `` critical '' value , and is no better than just using @xmath3 as an explosion diagnostic .",
    "the antesonic condition fares better than the timescale ratio condition .",
    "even so , it lacks the accuracy and predictive attributes of the integral condition .    to derive the integral condition",
    ", we made two approximations that must be investigated further : we assume that @xmath0 corresponds to explosion , and we assume steady - state throughout our derivation .",
    "these are two very strong assumptions that could have invalidated our derivation .",
    "for example , @xmath0 does not necessarily equate to explosion , especially if we relax the steady - state condition .",
    "oscillations of the shock are one example in which @xmath0 may manifest but not lead to explosion . in order to make progress",
    ", we decided to see where these approximations lead . in the end",
    ", we were able to derive an integral explosion diagnostic that successfully describes the explosion conditions of parameterized 1d simulations .",
    "however , we do not show that once @xmath9 and the shock begins to move outward that it continues to move outward .",
    "in some sense , one expects the shock to continue to move out , because once @xmath9 the only steady - state solutions are ones with @xmath138 , but this does not preclude the possibility of a dynamic ( non steady - state ) solution that is oscillatory . a next step in confirming our derivation is to show that once @xmath9 , the dynamic solution is one in which @xmath0 continues .",
    "we found the integral condition to be a successful explosion diagnostic for 1d parameterized explosions , but we suspect that it can do much more .",
    "we suspect that the integral condition may be an excellent explosion diagnostic for self - consistent 3d core - collapse supernova simulations",
    ". one may even be able to predict whether a certain progenitor model will explode without even performing core - collapse simulations .",
    "this hope will only be realized with further model developments , replacing parameters currently measured from simulations with parameters calculated by other means .",
    "but before we can even pursue such bold endeavors , we must adapt the integral condition to include the appropriate physics . for one ,",
    "we derive the integral condition using newtonian gravity ; general relativistic considerations are important , so we will need to take the straightforward steps in deriving the condition in gr .",
    "second , we need to incorporate a more self - consistent neutrino heating and cooling .",
    "third , we need to incorporate multi - dimensional effects .",
    "turbulence seems to reduce the critical neutrino luminosity for explosion ; we suspect that one can easily use a turbulence model to derive a new integral condition for explosion including turbulence .    in summary",
    ", we derive an integral condition for explosion and verify it with 1d parameterized simulations .",
    "when combined with simple steady - state model s , it suggests a new explosion diagnostic , @xmath7 , that we argue may be a more predictive measure of a models explodability than other diagnostics .",
    "finally , we point out that our integral formulation can be extended with better physics , and we are hopeful that this approach may prove useful in disentangling the complicated interactions of various physical effects and in understanding the mechanism of core - collapse supernovae in nature .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the pioneering work of adam burrows , hans - thomas janka , and mathias liebendrfer whose contributions to ccsn theory were directly inspirational to the work presented here .",
    "this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "identifying the steady - state solution with the minimum @xmath6 is key in developing the explosion diagnostic in section  [ sec : explodability ] and figure  [ fig : nearness ] .",
    "therefore , in this appendix , we present the steady - state equations and solution techniques that we used to obtain the family of solutions .    to accommodate the analytic eos described in the next appendix , we recast the steady - state equations in terms of the natural independent variables .",
    "because the analytic eos in appendix  [ app : eos ] is most naturally written as a function of density and temperature , @xmath139 , we re - write the steady - state equations as differential equations for @xmath140 , @xmath18 , and @xmath141 .",
