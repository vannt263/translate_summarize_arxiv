    "the results of solar  @xcite-@xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite-@xcite and accelerator  @xcite-@xcite neutrino experiments show that flavour mixing occurs not only in the hadronic sector , as it has been known for long , but in the leptonic sector as well .",
    "the experimental results point to two very distinct mass - squared differences , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . at present , only two out of the four parameters of the three - family leptonic mixing matrix @xmath18  @xcite-@xcite are known : @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the other two parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , are still unknown : for the mixing angle @xmath8 direct searches at reactors  @xcite-@xcite and three - family global analyses of the experimental data give the upper bound @xmath21 ; for the leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath12 we have no information whatsoever ( see , however , ref .",
    "we have no clue on the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates , either , i.e. on the sign of the atmospheric mass difference @xmath22 ( of which only the absolute value has been measured ) .",
    "it must be stressed that neutrinos being hierarchically ordered ( @xmath23 ) or with an inverted hierarchy ( @xmath24 ) makes a big difference for cosmology and neutrino - less double @xmath0-decay experiments @xcite .    the full understanding of the leptonic mixing matrix constitutes , together with the discrimination of the dirac / majorana character of neutrinos and with the measurement of their absolute mass scale , the main neutrino - physics goal for the next decade . in the recent past ,",
    "most of the experimental breakthroughs in neutrino physics have been achieved by exploiting the so - called `` disappearance channels '' : by observing a deficit in the neutrinos that reach the detector with respect to those expected to be emitted from the source , a positive and eventually unambiguous signal of neutrino oscillations has been established .",
    "new - generation experiments have been proposed to look for the fleeting and intimately related parameters @xmath8 and @xmath12 through `` appearance channels '' such as @xmath25 ( the `` golden channel '' ) @xcite and @xmath26 ( the `` silver channel '' ) @xcite . however , strong correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath12 @xcite and the presence of parametric degeneracies in the ( @xmath27 ) parameter space , @xcite-@xcite , make the simultaneous measurement of the two variables extremely difficult .",
    "a further problem arises from our present imprecise knowledge of atmospheric parameters , whose uncertainties are far too large to be neglected when looking for such tiny signals as those expected in appearance experiments @xcite .",
    "most of the proposed solutions to these problems imply the combination of different experiments and facilities , such as reactors ( double chooz @xcite should start data taking in 2008 ) , super - beams ( of which t2k @xcite is the first approved one ) , @xmath0-beams @xcite or the neutrino factory @xcite . to compare different options and to understand which of them is the one to be pursued as a future neutrino facility ,",
    "a list of observables to be measured has been defined : @xmath8 ; the cp - violating phase @xmath12 ; the sign of the atmospheric mass difference ( hereafter called @xmath28 ) ; the deviation from @xmath29 ; the @xmath30-octant ( if @xmath31 ) .",
    "aside from these measurements , a new facility should also reduce the present errors on atmospheric and solar parameters .",
    "a comparison of all the proposed facilities based on this `` shopping list '' has been presented in the _ international scoping study of a future neutrino factory and superbeam facility _ ( iss )",

    "the nominal luminosity of this second facility is @xmath40 @xmath37he ( @xmath41 @xmath38ne ) useful ion decays per year .    in this paper we consider the same physics case of these two setups , namely , @xmath42 and out of the reach of the next generation of approved experiments .",

    "we have studied the performance of this setup as a function of the flux .",
    "the outcome of our analysis is that the physics reach of such a facility , according to the `` shopping list '' defined above , is comparable with that of the two reference neutrino factory  based and @xmath0-beam  based setups defined above if a flux of @xmath7 @xmath1li/@xmath1b ion decays per year per baseline could be achieved .",

    "however , it is severely outperformed by the latter when looking for @xmath12 .",
    "this happens because the average neutrino energy for nf  based setups is , generally , much above the @xmath53 oscillation peak for the considered baselines . as a consequence ,",
    "the ( @xmath54 intrinsic degeneracy is particularly harmful , resulting in a reduced sensitivity to @xmath12 .",
    "the sign degeneracy is also the cause of a severe loss of sensitivity to @xmath12 for intermediate @xmath8 , @xmath55 $ ] , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this problem is cured in three steps : ( 1 ) adding a second ( identical ) detector located at the so - called `` magic baseline '' @xcite , @xmath33 km ; ( 2 ) using new oscillation channels ( the `` silver '' and `` platinum '' channels @xcite ) ; and , eventually , ( 3 ) with an improved magnetized iron detector , with a very good efficiency to select the charge of cc @xmath52 events with @xmath56 gev and a non - vanishing events for @xmath57 gev . ] efficiency for cc @xmath52 events down to @xmath58 gev @xcite .",
    "the three improvements have a similar effect : they help in solving the degeneracy problem in the region of small but not - vanishing @xmath8 ( where the problem of parametric degeneracy is more severe ) .",
    "after these changes with respect to the single baseline option , the neutrino factory setup and the high-@xmath35 he / ne @xmath0-beam have comparable sensitivity to @xmath12 , with the @xmath0-beam performing slightly better than the neutrino factory for large @xmath8 , and the neutrino factory besting the @xmath0-beam for small @xmath8 . eventually , the double baseline neutrino factory setup improves further its impressive sensitivity to @xmath28 with respect to the single baseline option , thanks to the second baseline of @xmath33 km .",

    "this setup is rather expensive and extremely demanding from the technical point of view ( both things are , of course , highly correlated ) . in particular , to produce and maintain such an intense neutrino flux , state - of - the - art technology is not enough .",
    "a short - list of technical problems still to be solved to pursue this setup consists ( at least ) of : ( 1 ) the design of a target that can survive a sustained 4mw proton current ( the merit r&d experiment is currently studying this problem , @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) the amount of muon cooling that is needed to accelerate and fill the storage ring such as to maintain the desired neutrino flux must be evaluated .",
    "different options to cool the muons including linac s , ffag s or hybrid techniques are under investigation ( the mice r&d experiment is currently studying the possibility to cool muons through linac s , @xcite , whereas a nested ffag s chain is under construction in japan ) ; ( 3 ) the expected radioactivity in the proximity of the target and of the storage ring must be studied and , if huge , reduced to acceptable levels .",
    "some of these problems are common to alternative options and some are peculiar to nf  based setups .",
    "for example , r&d on new targets is useful for very intense super - beams , also , whereas activation of the storage ring is a concern of @xmath0-beam options , too .",
    "a new proposal should be compared with the reference setup ( as defined above ) taking into account at the same time the physics performance according to the `` shopping list '' , its technical feasibility and its cost .",

    "a further consequence of having an energetic neutrino flux is that we can safely use dense detectors with a good muon identification efficiency , as an alternative to the water erenkov technology .",

    "notice that , since one of the baselines is tuned to the oscillation peak , this setup is expected to suffer from a much softer degeneracy problem with respect to nf  based setups ( as it was the case for the high-@xmath35 he / ne @xmath0-beam ) . the longer baseline ( @xmath6 km )",
    "is far from the first oscillation peak but close to the baseline at which the ( anti)neutrino oscillation probabilities present a resonant enhancement for normal ( inverted ) hierarchy , thus providing excellent sensitivities to the mass hierarchy @xcite .",

    "the key parameter in the optimization of the @xmath0-beam flux is the relativistic @xmath35 factor : if the baseline is tuned to be at an oscillation peak for @xmath53 transitions , the statistics that can be collected in the detector scales linearly with @xmath35 @xcite .",
