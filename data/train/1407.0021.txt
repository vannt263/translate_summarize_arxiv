    "the primordial @xmath0li abundance is derived from observations of low - metallicity halo stars @xcite . at the same time",
    "one can theoretically estimate the @xmath0li abundance from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) by fixing the baryon - to - photon ratio ( @xmath2 ) to the value determined from fits to the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there still remains a gap between astronomically observed and cosmologically inferred @xmath0li abundances .",
    "this conundrum is called the `` li problem '' @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider three possible resolutions of this conundrum both separately and in concert as a means to deduce the optimum parameter space to resolve this dilemma .",
    "table [ tab : models ] summarizes the status and weakness of each of the models and combinations considered here .",
    "the first and second rows show models and corresponding @xmath2 values , respectively . below the third row ,",
    "the first and second columns show nuclides and observational constraints on primordial abundances , respectively , while the third to seventh columns correspond to calculated results in models of ( i ) standard bbn ( sbbn ) , ( ii ) photon - cooling after the bbn epoch , ( iii ) bbn with a long - lived radiatively decaying @xmath1particle with the parameter set ( @xmath3 , @xmath4)=(@xmath5 s , @xmath6 gev ) , ( iv ) bbn with a magnetic field , ( v ) bbn with photon cooling , @xmath1particles with the parameter set ( @xmath3 , @xmath4)=(@xmath7 s , @xmath6 gev ) @xcite , and a magnetic field , respectively .",
    "check marks ( @xmath8 ) or hyphens ( - ) indicate that calculated abundances are consistent or inconsistent , respectively , with observations .",
    "a question mark ( ? ) indicates that a calculated result is near ( though slightly outside of ) the observationally allowed region . in the last row ,",
    "`` high '' indicates that the resulting @xmath9li abundance can be higher than in the sbbn but within the current observational upper limit @xcite .    as a first possibility we consider photon cooling .",
    "it is one of the more innovative solutions to the li problem .",
    "if photons are cooled sometime after the end of bbn , then the baryon - to - photon ratio during bbn is smaller than the present value and the excess production of @xmath0li can be avoided .",
    "the candidate mechanisms for such cooling are a possible scalar particle that forms a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) during the post bbn epoch , but before photon decoupling .",
    "although the dark - matter axion was initially considered as a candidate particle for this bec @xcite , the cooling occurs too late so that it disagrees with the cmb constraints on the chemical potential @xmath10 and the compton @xmath11 parameter ( see sec . [",
    "sec : distortion ] ) .",
    "another possibility , however could be resonant oscillations between photons and light abelian gauge bosons in the hidden sector @xcite .",
    "another proposed solution to the li problem is the radiative decay of a hypothetical exotic long - lived ( @xmath12 ) particle after bbn @xcite . as noted in table [ tab : models ] , however , the decaying particle model ( without assuming photon cooling ) can not resolve the @xmath0li problem by itself  @xcite . here",
    "we point out , however , that this paradigm could solve the problem of deuterium overproduction in the photon cooling model @xcite .",
    "in such a hybrid model consisting of photon cooling plus a radiatively decaying particle , the primordial d abundance is decreased via the photodisintegration reaction , @xmath13h(@xmath14 , @xmath15)@xmath16h , by nonthermal photons produced from the decaying @xmath1particle @xcite .    of relevance to the present work",
    "is the fact that the cosmic expansion rate can also be boosted by the energy density of a primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) .",
    "hence , bbn with a pmf leads to different results than without a pmf @xcite and can potentially improve the solution to the li problem . in this paper , therefore , we consider the combined effects of photon cooling , the radiative decay of an @xmath1particle , and a pmf on bbn .",
    "we then utilize a maximum likelihood analysis of the observed abundances of light elements up to li to constrain the parameters characterizing the @xmath1particles and the pmf .",
    "we also note that another possible solution to the li problem has been proposed based upon a variant of the decaying @xmath1particle scenario .",
    "this solution is based upon exotic atomic and nuclear reactions induced by a long - lived negatively charged massive particle @xmath17 @xcite during bbn @xcite .",
    "such a charged particle with mass @xmath18(1 gev ) can recombine with positively charged nuclei via radiative - capture reactions of bare nuclei and @xmath17 @xcite or nuclear charge - exchange reactions between electronic ions and the @xmath17 , especially @xmath0be@xmath19be@xmath20 @xcite in a late epoch of bbn .",
    "bound states of nuclei and @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath21 or @xmath12 nuclei , then induce atomic and nuclear reactions . among the reactions , new types of resonant nuclear reactions of @xmath0be@xmath22b@xmath23 are made possible through an atomic excited state , @xmath24b@xmath25 @xcite and an atomic ground state consisting of the @xmath26 nuclear excited state of @xmath24b and an @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath24b@xmath27(@xmath26,0.770  mev)@xmath28  @xcite .",
    "primordial @xmath0be nuclei are destroyed via these reactions , and the final abundance ratio of @xmath0li / h is reduced . although this remains as an interesting solution to the li problem , the destruction of deuterium does not occur in this model .",
    "however , deuterium destruction is an essential part of models with photon cooling .",
    "hence , we do not consider the @xmath17 paradigm in the models discussed below .",
    "this paper is then organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] we present details of each model and in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelsc ] we introduce a model that includes the combined effects on bbn from photon cooling , radiative @xmath12 decay , and a pmf . in sec .",
    "[ sec : distortion ] we describe the constraints on the photon cooling from an analysis of the energy spectrum of the cmb . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show results of the bbn calculation and parameter search .",
    "we then discuss the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , and summarize this work .",
    "we have modified the kawano bbn code @xcite to take into account the effects of ( i ) photon cooling ( ii ) the radiative decay of the @xmath1particle , and ( iii ) a pmf .",
    "we assume that the photon cooling occurs after both bbn and the @xmath12 decay .",
    "the effect of the @xmath12 decay is included using a method similar to that described in ref .",
    "the effect of photon cooling on the nuclear abundances enters through the difference between the baryon - to - photon ratio at the epoch of bbn and the value at the time of cosmological recombination .",
    "all relevant effects of a pmf are included as described in ref .",
    "the reaction rates are taken from the jina reaclib database v1.0 @xcite .",
    "we adopt a neutron life time of @xmath29 s @xcite . for nonthermal",
    "nucleosynthesis we have utilized updated reaction rates for @xmath30he photodisintegration  @xcite derived from the cross section data obtained from precise measurements with laser - compton photons  @xcite .    in ref . @xcite we utilized the nonthermal nuclear transfer functions @xcite for a value of @xmath31 from the wmap 3yr @xcite analyses obtained .",
    "however , the transfer functions depend upon the baryon - to - photon ratio , and should be corrected for changes in both the nuclear abundances and the @xmath2 value . in this study , therefore , transfer functions were updated by a self - consistent calculation for bbn as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the energy loss rate for nonthermal photons and the rates for energy loss and the destruction of nonthermal nuclei produced by the energetic photons were thus modified .",
    "as long as the effects of the radiative decay of the @xmath12 are not too large and the light element abundances are not significantly different from the sbbn predictions , then consistent results could be derived in this model calculation .",
    "we calculated nuclear transfer functions in this nonthermal nucleosynthesis model for 11 different @xmath2 values .",
    "we then interpolated the transfer functions as a function of @xmath2 to deduce calculated abundances .",
    "we then compare light element abundances calculated in the bbn model to observational abundance constraints .",
    "we utilized element abundances constrained by observations as summarized on the second column of table [ tab : models ] [ see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ] .",
    "we adopt constraints on the baryon - to - photon number ratio as deduced from the wmap 9yr @xcite analysis , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the number densities of baryons and photons , respectively , @xmath35 is the baryon contribution to the closure density , and @xmath36 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 .",
    "we use @xmath38 as the number of neutrino species .",
    "this is not to be confused with the effective number of neutrino species @xmath39 discussed below .",
    "we also note that the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath39 is negligible based upon the results of the wmap 9yr analysis @xcite as shown in table [ tabel2 ] .",
    "when there is photon cooling the number density of photons at the bbn epoch is greater than that without it .",
    "therefore , the baryon - to - photon ratio at the bbn epoch , @xmath40 will be less than the value fixed by the cmb power spectrum . the predicted baryon - to - photon ratio in the photon cooling bec model @xcite is smaller due to the statistical degrees of freedom by a factor of @xmath41 at bbn : @xmath42 independently of the cooling epoch . in the photon cooling model , the d , @xmath43he and @xmath9li abundances increase , while the @xmath30he and @xmath0li abundances decrease .",
    "the @xmath0li abundance derived via a photon - cooling model can be consistent with the observed value",
    ". however , this leads to an overabundance of d.      nonthermal electromagnetic energy injection caused by the radiative decay of a long - lived massive @xmath12 particle after the bbn epoch can generate nonthermal photons @xcite .",
    "such decaying particles are predicted in particle theories beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "examples include the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "energetic photons emitted by the radiative decay can react with background photons to create @xmath44 pairs , and an electromagnetic cascade shower develops .",
    "the spectrum of nonthermal photons associated with this shower has an upper cutoff at energy @xmath45 with @xmath46 the electron mass  @xcite . at high temperature in the early universe ,",
    "the cutoff energies are smaller .",
    "as the temperature of the universe decreases over time , the nonthermal photons from the particle decay gradually disintegrate the light nuclei produced in bbn @xcite . among such light nuclei , @xmath0be and d",
    "are the most strongly photodisintegrated because the threshold energies for @xmath0be and d photodisintegration are 1.5866 and 2.2246 mev , respectively .",
    "they are mainly photodisintegrated via the @xmath0be+@xmath47he+@xmath30he and d+@xmath48 reactions , where @xmath14 s represent nonthermal photons .",
    "since these photodisintegrations begin when the cutoff energies exceed the threshold energies , the destruction of @xmath0be and d starts early ( @xmath49k ) which corresponds to @xmath50  s. therefore , if the cutoff energy is above the threshold energies for @xmath0be and d destruction , but below that of other nuclei , @xmath0be and d are destroyed by the nonthermal photon field , while other nuclei are unaffected .",
    "long after the bbn epoch , @xmath0be nuclei recombine with electrons , and are converted to @xmath0li via electron capture , i.e. , @xmath0be + e@xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath0li + @xmath53 .",
    "the primordial @xmath0li abundance is , therefore , the sum of the abundances of @xmath0li and @xmath0be produced in bbn .",
    "the @xmath0be photodisintegration triggered by the @xmath12 decay thus reduces the primordial @xmath0li abundance .",
    "one problem with the photon cooling model was d overproduction ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "this can be fixed , however , by d photodisintegration in a bbn model in which both photon cooling and a radiatively decaying particle are included .",
    "there are two parameters which characterize effects of the electromagnetic energy injection .",
    "one is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the ratio of the number density of decaying @xmath12 particles and the number density of the background radiation before the decay of the @xmath12 , and @xmath56 is the energy of the photon emitted by the radiative decay .",
    "the other parameter is @xmath3 , the decay lifetime of the @xmath12 particle @xcite .",
    "a third cosmological scenario considered here is that of a primordial magnetic field @xcite .",
    "when one adds the energy density of a possible pmf during the bbn epoch , the rate of the cosmic expansion is more rapid than without a pmf . in this case",
    ", the freeze - out of the weak reactions can occur earlier .",
    "the neutron abundance at the epoch of weak - reaction freeze - out then increases . due to the faster cosmic expansion the time interval after the freeze - out until @xmath30he",
    "production also becomes shorter .",
    "therefore , more neutrons survive the @xmath57-decay until the start of the @xmath30he production epoch . as a result @xcite the @xmath30he abundance increases significantly , while the d and @xmath43he abundances increase moderately , the @xmath9li abundance increases slightly , and the @xmath0li abundance decreases .      we have utilized a likelihood analysis to constrain the parameters of the @xmath12 particle and a pmf .",
    "the likelihood function for any observed value @xmath58 can be expressed as @xmath59 , \\label{l_fun1st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the theoretical value calculated as a function of @xmath2 , and @xmath58 is the observed distribution from table [ tab : models ] .",
    "to constrain @xmath61 , we use the combined likelihood functions as follows : @xmath62 where the likelihood functions for respective parameters are defined by @xmath63",
    "we assume that there is a cooling of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) between the bbn epoch and the epoch of cosmological recombination . proposed cooling mechanisms include energy transfer to a light abelian gauge boson that mixes with the photon @xcite , or the energy transfer to an axion @xcite .",
    "although photon cooling via a dark - matter axion interaction is ruled out by cmb observations as shown below , our consideration is applicable to any general photon cooling mechanism such as a photon mixing with an additional gauge boson @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case , the energy transfer to and from the cbr is constrained by the observed energy spectrum of the cmb .",
    "since the energy transfer during a late epoch of the universe would distort the cmb blackbody spectrum , this possibility is constrained by the observed consistency of the cmb spectrum with that of a perfect blackbody  @xcite . for epochs",
    "earlier than @xmath64 , thermal bremsstrahlung , [ i.e. free - free emission ( @xmath65 ) , where @xmath66 is any ion ] and radiative - compton scattering ( @xmath67 ) act effectively to erase any distortion of the cbr spectrum from that of a blackbody . for energy transfer in later epochs @xmath68 , processes changing the photon number become ineffective , so that compton scattering ( @xmath69 ) causes the photons and electrons to achieve statistical ( but not thermodynamic ) equilibrium .",
    "then , the photon spectrum obeys a bose - einstein distribution @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the momentum and energy of the photon , and @xmath10 is the dimensionless chemical potential derived from the conservation of photon number .",
    "analyses of the cmb data suggest a relatively low baryon density so that double compton scattering dominates the thermalization process . for a small value of @xmath10 ,",
    "as inferred from cmb observations , the chemical potential imprinted at the epoch of energy injection or loss can be approximated analytically  @xcite as @xmath73^{1/2 }   \\left[\\frac{\\delta \\rho_\\gamma / n_\\gamma}{6.75 \\times 10^{-7}~{\\rm gev}}\\right]\\frac{\\exp[{-(\\tau_{\\rm dc}/t_{\\rm cool})^{5/4}}]}{0.293}~~ ,   \\label{distortion2}\\ ] ] with @xmath74^ { \\hspace{-2pt } -12/5 } \\hspace{-3pt }   \\left[\\frac{\\omega_b h^2}{0.0226}\\right]^ { \\hspace{-2pt } 4/5 } \\hspace{-3pt }   \\left[\\frac{1-y_p/2}{0.877}\\right]^ { \\hspace{-2pt } 4/5}~~ ,   \\label{distortion3}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the time of the photon cooling , @xmath76 is the difference between photon energy densities before and after the cooling , @xmath34 is the photon number density at the photon cooling epoch , @xmath77 is the present cmb temperature , and @xmath78 is the primordial he abundance .    when energy transfers from photons to another particle , here assumed to be a spinless boson , up to a factor of 1/3 of the initial photon energy",
    "can be exchanged .",
    "this factor is derived assuming a complete thermalization of photons and bosons with statistical degrees of freedom of two and one , respectively .",
    "the cosmic time at which photon cooling occurs should be much earlier than @xmath79 .",
    "otherwise the amount of energy transfer should be diminished in order to avoid an unrealistically large relic chemical potential . however , in the original axion bec model by erken _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the photon cooling occurs after the temperature of the universe decreases to @xmath80 500 ev . if the cooling of photons through a gravitational interaction of axions is effective enough , as supposed in ref .",

    "the photon cooling if any , therefore , must occur at a temperature lower than 1 kev .",
    "this situation , however , is completely excluded by the very small upper limit to @xmath10 consistent with the cmb black body spectrum  @xcite unless both @xmath87 and @xmath85 are at their maximum allowed values . in eq .",
    "( [ distortion2 ] ) , numerical values correspond to the case that an energy transfer from the cbr occurs at @xmath88 ev by as much as 1/3 of the total cbr energy .    for late energy transfer at @xmath89 ,",
    "compton scattering produces little effect and can not reestablish a bose - einstein spectrum .",
    "the distorted spectrum can then be described by the compton parameter @xmath11 .",
    "there is a relation between @xmath11 and the amount of the energy transfer , @xmath90 , where @xmath76 and @xmath91 are the total transferred energy density and the cbr energy density , respectively .",
    "if 1/3 of the initial photon energy is transferred to another particle during the cooling , then the ratio of the energy injected into or extracted from the cbr energy per comoving volume is @xmath92 so , the compton @xmath11 value becomes @xmath93 .",
    "the cmb spectrum has been well measured .",
    "the limit on the chemical potential has been deduced to be @xmath94 from an analysis of data from the far - infrared absolute spectrophotometer on board the cosmic background explorer @xcite .",
    "the compton @xmath11-parameter is , on the other hand , constrained to be @xmath95 based upon an updated constraint from the second generation of the absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics , and diffuse emission @xcite utilizing a better fitting procedure  @xcite .",

    "is excluded by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 limits , energy transfer is allowed only when the transfer epoch occurs sufficiently early , i.e. , @xmath99 s.",
    "the combined constraints on the @xmath12 particle and the pmf parameters in the new hybrid model introduced here were deduced in a maximum likelihood analysis .",

    "the reason is as follows . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the photon - cooling epoch after bbn is followed by a complete thermalization of the cosmic background radiation . after cooling",
    ", the baryon - to - photon ratio is then higher than in the case without cooling . also , the ratio of energy densities of the magnetic field to the photons is higher by a factor of @xmath112 . consequently , the comoving pmf amplitude @xmath103 after the epoch of photon cooling is a factor of @xmath113 larger than in the case without cooling .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows contours of 1 and 2 @xmath109 confidence limits on various planes of the @xmath12 particle and pmf parameters ( i.e. ,  @xmath100 vs. @xmath101 , @xmath114 vs. @xmath101 and @xmath114 vs @xmath100 ) .",

    "finally , it is worthwhile to mention that one should compute both bbn and the cmb and compare these theoretical predictions with observations of the light element abundances and the cmb spectra simultaneously .",
