    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are among that rare class of astronomical objects whose dynamical evolution can be probed directly through both radial velocity and proper motion measurements .",
    "together such studies provide important constraints on the evolution of young snrs and the structure of the ejecta and ambient medium .",
    "furthermore , when its distance is known , measurement of a remnant s proper motion is equivalent to a measurement of the velocity of the supernova blast wave .",
    "this fundamental quantity determines the total energy available to the remnant for partition into bulk kinetic energy of the ambient medium , shock - heated electrons and ions , and relativistic particles , i.e. , cosmic rays ( see chevalier 1983 ; decourchelle , ellison , & ballet 2000 ) .",
    "conservation laws provide some constraints on how the shock energy is divided up into the several forms , but some issues , such as the fraction of shock energy that goes into cosmic rays and the extent of collisionless heating of the electrons , are still theoretically uncertain and need to be determined observationally .",
    "the brightest x - ray supernova remnant ( snr ) in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , , is dominated by line emission from highly ionized atoms of o , ne , and mg ( hayashi et al .  1994 ; gaetz et al .",
    "2000 ) and its x - ray morphology is that of a strongly limb - brightened shell , roughly 40@xmath3 in diameter ( hughes 1988 ) .",
    "optical filaments in the remnant are also rich in o and ne , extend over a diameter of 24@xmath3 ( dopita et al .  1981 ) , and display radial velocities that span a range of 6500  ( tuohy & dopita 1983 ) . at the distance to the smc",
    "( 60 kpc , e.g. , van den bergh 2000 ) , the proper motion of the optical filaments should be @xmath4 yr@xmath2 or an expansion rate of 0.092% yr@xmath2 .",
    "herein we determine the x - ray expansion rate , equivalent to the velocity of the shock , to obtain an estimate of the total shock energy .",
    "we then compare this to the electron temperature in the immediate post - shock region , through fits to spectra isolated by s superb spatial resolution , to determine the fraction of energy in shock - heated electrons .",
    "prior to the launch of  the highest spatial resolution images of  were those taken by the  and  high resolution imagers , hereafter ehri and rhri . during orbital activation and",
    "check - out of ,  was observed by the back - side illuminated chip ( s3 ) of the acis - s instrument ( garmire 1997 ) . a processed event file ( i d no .",
    "1231 created on 1999 - 09 - 07t18:39:11 ) was obtained from the  x - ray center and analysis was carried out using standard astronomical software . for spectral analysis (  3 ) the events were gain - corrected using the appropriate gain map for a focal plane temperature of @xmath5100 c. events were time filtered to remove intervals of high background as well as frames with bad or no aspect .",
    "dead and flickering pixels were also removed .",
    "an ephemeris of all three observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the ehri and rhri each made broad - band x - ray images , but in slightly different spectral bands .",
    "the possibility of spectral variations with position has been the main factor limiting the widespread use of ehri and rhri images for carrying out precise proper motion studies of x - ray snrs .",
    "now , however , the  acis - s data provide a spectral dimension that can be used to take full advantage of the long time baseline for proper motion studies set by the earlier observations .",
    "in our approach we slice the acis - s data into a large number ( 50100 ) of images according to observed photon energy using narrow x - ray spectral bands .",
    "these separate images are then multiplied by the ratio of effective area between the ehri ( for example ) and the  acis - s at the photon energy appropriate to the spectral band of each individual image slice .",
    "the final acis - s image , corrected to the ehri band in this case , is then the sum of the image slices .",
    "this is done for both of the hris .",
    "clearly the accuracy of this procedure depends on how well the various effective area functions are known , an effect we explore below .",
    "the on - orbit 50% encircled energy radius for the  acis - s , @xmath6 ( dewey 1999 ) , is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of the rhri or ehri , both of which had @xmath7 ( giacconi et al .  1979 ;",
    "david et al .",
    "we can therefore ignore the small  point - response - function ( prf ) and convolve the band - corrected acis - s image with the appropriate ehri or rhri prf models . in our preliminary investigations we found that the parameters of the analytical prf models ( ehri : henry & henriksen 1986 ; rhri david et al .",
    "1998 ) needed to be modified slightly from their published values in order to obtain good fits to the  data . for both datasets it was the largest spatial scale component of the prf model that needed adjustment . for the rhri",
    "the best - fit normalization of the @xmath130@xmath3-scale exponential component was 33% higher than nominal and for the ehri the normalization of the @xmath113@xmath3-scale power - law component was less than nominal by 22% .",
    "is small enough that spatial variations in the background , vignetting , or prf can all be safely neglected .",
    "the final piece of information required for the expansion study is the plate scales of the three instruments .",
    "the plate scales of the ehri and rhri are @xmath8 per pixel and @xmath9 per pixel , respectively ( david et al .",
    "1998 ) . for the acis - s the plate scale near the center of the field of view is @xmath10 per pixel based on  in - flight observations of the star cluster ngc 2516 ( m.  markevitch 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "this value is within 0.2% of the pre - flight estimate of @xmath11 per pixel .",
    "the approach we follow for determining the expansion rate is that described in hughes ( 1999 ) . in brief",
    "each hri image ( the `` data '' ) is compared to the appropriate band - corrected acis - s image ( the `` model '' ) in a fit for parameters using a maximum - likelihood estimator as the figure - of - merit function .",
    "the fitted parameters are the relative intensity scale between the two images , the relative pixel position , the fractional amount of expansion or contraction of the spatial scale , and the normalization of the largest - scale prf component .",
    "the difference in background levels ( e.g. , acis - s vs.ehri or hri ) is fixed at the value determined from source - free portions of the image and is included as a spatially uniform term . in the fitting software the expansion or contraction of the `` model '' image",
    "is done first using a rebinning scheme that conserves flux , then the scaled image is convolved with the appropriate instrumental prf , and finally the background term is included .",
    "the only interesting parameter that we obtain from this comparison is the expansion ( or contraction ) factor , which tells us the global mean expansion rate of the remnant .",
    "this procedure explicitly assumes that the fractional expansion rate is uniform over the entire remnant , both radially and azimuthally .",
    "figure 1 shows the fitted results .",
    "has expanded by @xmath12% based on comparing the rhri and acis - s data and it has expanded by @xmath13% based on comparing the ehri and acis - s data .",
    "the quoted errors are purely statistical at 1 sigma and include both poisson error ( dominated by the ehri and rhri data ) as well as the uncertainty in the plate scales .",
    "the two points are described best by a uniform expansion rate of @xmath14% yr@xmath2 .",
    "the null hypothesis that the remnant has remained constant in size can be rejected at the @xmath15 confidence level .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that systematic effects could account for these results .",
    "for example , the  plate scale would have to be incorrect by more than 1% , which is 50 times the statistical uncertainty on the calibration measurement .",
    "we investigated systematic errors due to uncertainty in the analytical prf models and in the effective area functions and the boxes plotted in fig .  1",
    "show an estimate of their likely effect on the expansion measurements .",
    "neither is expected to be a dominant source of error .",
    "the eastern limb of  in the  image ( blair et al .  2000 , gaetz et al .",
    "2000 ) displays a smooth , nearly circular , faint rim of x - ray emission . beyond the edge of the rim the surface brightness drops by more than two orders of magnitude to the average background level over a distance of order 1@xmath3 .",
    "herein we identify this jump as the sn shock wave plowing into the ambient medium ( hereafter `` blast wave '' ) .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of the blast wave region from within a partial annulus of thickness @xmath16 and outer radius 21@xmath3 that covered the angular range from @xmath530@xmath17 to 155@xmath17 ( angles measured counterclockwise from north ) .",
    "we ignored the background since it was negligibly small ( less than 1% ) .",
    "the spectral data were contained within a single readout node of chip s3 , nevertheless the spectrum included data from several detector regions with potentially different intrinsic responses to incident x - rays . individual response functions ( both effective area functions and spectral redistribution matrices )",
    "were generated for the several regions covered by the extraction region and then combined , weighting by the number of x - ray events , into a single global response function .",
    "the results we obtain are insensitive to this procedure : our fitted parameters are nearly unchanged if we use the response functions from any individual extraction region .",
    "because of the limited statistical precision of our spectrum ( which contained only @xmath11500 detected events ) the uncertainty on derived parameters is dominated by poisson counting errors rather than calibration uncertainties .",
    "figure 2 plots the blast wave spectrum and best - fit nonequilibrium ionization model ( nei ) ( hughes & singh 1994 ) . the spectrum shows a well - resolved ly@xmath18 line at 0.653 kev , a blend of and k - shell lines in addition to fe l - shell lines around 1 kev , and the he - like 2@xmath191 line complex at @xmath11.34 kev .",
    "the mere presence of these lines suggests a moderately low electron temperature , @xmath20 kev , as our detailed fits confirm .",
    "table 2 gives best - fit parameters and 1-sigma statistical errors determined from two classes of nei models : ( 1 ) a `` single ionization timescale '' model which assumes a single , constant value for both the temperature and ionization timescale in the blast wave region and ( 2 ) a `` planar shock '' model which also assumes a constant temperature , but integrates the emission from spectral components with ionization timescales varying linearly from 0 to @xmath21 ( the fit parameter ) and weighted by equal fractional intervals in @xmath21 .",
    "the first model provides a marginally acceptable fit to the  data ( the @xmath22 of 57 for 38 degrees of freedom can be rejected at the 97.5% confidence level ) .",
    "the second model , with no additional parameters , yields a much improved , and statistically acceptable , fit .",
    "elemental abundances were determined only for the species with obvious line emission in the observed spectrum , viz .",
    "o , ne , mg , and fe .",
    "the abundances of the other astrophysically common species were fixed at values appropriate to interstellar gas in the smc ( russell & dopita 1992 ) , an assumption that resulted in a significantly better fit than one where the abundances of the other species were fixed to standard solar abundances .",
    "the line - of - sight absorbing column density , @xmath23 , was separated into a component with normal solar composition arising from the galaxy and a component from the smc with lower abundances .",
    "the galactic component was fixed at an @xmath24 value consistent with reddening estimates and the galactic column to , while the smc component was allowed to vary freely .",
    "the abundances from both model fits are nicely consistent with the well - known low metallicity of the gas in the smc ( @xmath125% solar ) , strongly suggesting that the emission we see from the outer rim comes from the shock wave propagating through interstellar gas . further in from the blast wave where the x - ray emission of  has become quite bright , the spectral character has changed as well . in fig .  2 the spectrum from the bright region in the southeast quadrant is plotted ( labeled `` ejecta '' ) .",
    "the superposed model spectrum , shown for comparison , is the blast wave nei model scaled in intensity to fit the continuum level of the ejecta spectrum .",
    "there are clear differences between the ejecta and blast wave spectra in terms of both thermodynamic state ( note , for example , the strength of the he - like 2@xmath191 line complex at @xmath10.57 kev in the ejecta which is virtually absent in the blast wave ) and the elemental abundances ( especially of o and ne ) .",
    "the enhanced abundances and less advanced ionization state of the ejecta are consistent with expectations for emission from the reverse shock propagating into higher density , metal - rich gas .",
    "the x - ray expansion rate of  is fully consistent with the remnant s proper motion estimated from the location and radial velocities of the oxygen - rich optical filaments .",
    "specifically our estimate of the remnant s age assuming free expansion , @xmath25 yr , agrees with that of tuohy & dopita ( 1983 ) . at the outermost edge of the x - ray emission from  ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the inferred velocity is @xmath27 km s@xmath2 , which we consider in the following to be the speed of the blast wave . according to the rankine - huguniot jump conditions in the absence of cosmic ray acceleration ( landau & lifshitz 1976 )",
    ", this velocity corresponds to a mean post - shock temperature of @xmath28 kev , using a mean mass per particle of @xmath29 .",
    "our measurement of the post - shock electron temperature from the  x - ray spectrum , @xmath30 kev , is at least 25 times smaller than this estimate .",
    "there are two principle assumptions that go into our estimate for the mean temperature : ( 1 ) that the post - shock thermal energy is partitioned equally between electrons and ions , and ( 2 ) that only a negligible fraction of the total energy of the shock goes into cosmic rays .",
    "it has been debated whether electron and ion temperatures are quickly equilibrated by plasma processes behind collisionless high mach number sn shocks ( mckee 1974 ; cargill & papadopoulos 1988 ) or if the electron and ion temperatures initially differ by their mass ratio ( @xmath31 ) and then equilibrate slowly through coulomb collisions ( shklovskii 1968 ) . for",
    "we find , ignoring for the moment any coulombic heating of the electrons downstream , that the ratio of electron thermal energy to upstream kinetic energy , @xmath32 , is much smaller than the value of 12% expected by cargill & papadopoulos ( 1988 ) .",
    "downstream of the blast wave , electrons and ions ( mainly protons ) will exchange energy through coulomb interactions , which provide the minimum level of heating expected in the case of nonequipartition . the electron temperature varies as      ( in cgs units ) ( spitzer 1978 , p.  22 ) , where we express the temperature variation in terms of @xmath21 , since we have an observational estimate of this quantity from the x - ray spectral fits ( table 2 ) .",
    "this equation predicts that the mean post - shock electron temperature ( averaging over @xmath21 from 0 to @xmath34 ) would be between 4.5 kev and 8 kev for proton temperatures corresponding to the measured shock velocity ( i.e. , @xmath35120 kev ) .",
    "note that the dependence of electron temperature on the actual value of @xmath21 up to which the averaging is done is weak .",
    "if the lower limit on the measured @xmath21 value , @xmath36 , from our spectral fits is used , then the average @xmath37 range becomes 3.56 kev .",
    "this estimate assumes that the total pressure ( @xmath38 ) remains constant in the post - shock region , when , in fact , some adiabatic decompression should occur as the shocked gas elements expand outward .",
    "estimates of this effect , assuming the post - shock gas acquires a speed of @xmath39 , indicate that the predicted electron temperatures may be reduced to no lower than @xmath12.5 kev , closer to , but still considerably higher than , the measured blast wave electron temperature in .",
    "these simple models suggest that post - shock proton temperatures of 40120 kev are just too high and that they need to be considerably reduced in order to match the  measurements .",
    "this in turn argues that cosmic ray production is _ not _ negligible in  and that the relativistic particles may be absorbing a significant fraction of the sn shock energy .",
    "recently decourchelle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that the fraction of energy going into cosmic rays is likely to be high in young snrs and that this effect has direct consequences for the thermal x - ray emission .",
    "in such a situation , the shock jump conditions are modified ( e.g. , blandford & eichler 1987 ) so that for a given shock velocity the compression ratio increases and the post - shock temperature decreases .",
    "nonlinear models of shock acceleration ( ellison 2000 ) appear fully consistent with the observed shock parameters of . in particular , these models predict a mean post - shock temperature of 1 kev ( see figure 1 in ellison 2000 ) for standard cosmic ray injection efficiencies and a high mach number shock , i.e. , values of 100300 , as appropriate for . thus it appears that efficient cosmic ray acceleration alone is sufficient to explain our observations of , even without the additional influence of nonequipartition of electron and ion temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , a direct measurement of the post - shock proton temperature in  is not possible , due to the absence of any h line emission from the remnant .",
    "therefore , constraints on the efficiency of cosmic ray production in  will need to come from future detailed studies of the compression ratio , the structure of the forward and reverse shocks , and the x - ray line spectrum using nei hydrodynamical models of snrs that include cosmic - ray acceleration ( e.g. , decourchelle et al .",
    "in addition , studies of other types of remnants , in particular balmer - dominated ones for which estimates of the proton temperature are available from h@xmath18 line profiles , should prove helpful in further elucidating the physics of collisionless shock fronts .",
