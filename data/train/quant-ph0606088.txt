    "the task of quantum state transfer(qst ) is to transfer a quantum state from the sender(alice ) to the receiver(bob ) . in 2003 , bose @xcite presented a scheme to transfer states using unmodulated spin chains .",
    "after that , much effort has been devoted to developing this scheme [ 2 - 19 ] . in this scheme",
    ", we encode the state at one end of the spin chain and wait for a specific amount of time , then we get the state at another end of the chain .",
    "all the operations and measurements are performed at the sending and receiving qubits , but the spin chain connecting them is under no operation .    a simple example of this scheme is a one - dimension spin chain of xy model interaction with equal nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "however , perfect qst can be achieved only when the number of spins is less than four @xcite .",
    "based on the cartesian product method of the graph theory , christandl _ et al _ @xcite extended the case of two or three spins to spin networks which can also get perfect qst . considering the symmetry of the hamiltonian(i.e .",
    ", mirror symmetry , translational symmetry ) , another approach is to use the hamiltonians with engineered couplings .",
    "recently , more attention was payed to get perfect qst with randomly coupled quantum spin chains .",
    "dual - rail \" encoding using two parallel quantum channels @xcite is suggested to get conclusive and arbitrary perfect qst .",
    "here , the word  conclusive \" means whether the state is transferred successfully can be determined by measuring one qubit of bob s without destroying the information .",
    "another method is to use local memories @xcite , by swapping the qubit of bob to the memory at equal time intervals , the whole information will be stored in the memories and can be decoded by time - reversed protocol .",
    "the aim of this paper is to replace the  dual - rail \" scheme @xcite with a single spin chain and reach perfect and arbitrary quantum state transfer .",
    "our scheme also provides a convenient and rapid decoding protocol for ref.@xcite .",
    "the first step of our scheme is to transfer the information to a collection of memories by continually swapping between bob and the memories , and the second step is decoding the information from the memories .",
    "our scheme is divided into four parts : a(alice ) , b(bob ) , c(other parts in the spin chain ) , m(memories ) .",
    "see fig.1 . a contains two identical portions @xmath0 and @xmath1 which have the same number of spins . when @xmath2 , it is convenient to transfer multi - qubit states and entangled states .",
    "there are switches connecting the first spin of c and @xmath0,@xmath1 respectively .",
    "although it is difficult to continually switch  on \" and  off \" in the spin channel , we use only limited switches at alice s site , this will not increase the complex of the system obviously .",
    "the hamiltonian of spin chain @xmath3 and @xmath4 are identical , and it can be randomly coupled heisenberg model or xy model . there is a not gate @xcite between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , controlled by @xmath0 being zero .",
    "b contains @xmath5 spins , in our scheme , we will perform local operations and measurements at bob s site .",
    "m is a series of memories : @xmath6 , and every memory has the same spins as bob s .",
    "we call it  memory \" because bob can perform a swap between his spins and every memory and store the state of bob in the memories . besides",
    ", bob can apply a cnot gate between his qubit and memories which will be discussed in decoding portion .",
    "the number of memories is decided by the fidelity we required and the ability of transfer of the spin chain .",
    "c is a spin chain with @xmath7 spins , and the coupling strength can be arbitrary .",
    "we do not perform any operation at c in our scheme .",
    "therefore , the total length of chain @xmath3 ( and @xmath4 ) is @xmath8 . in this paper , we just consider @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian we considered is given by @xmath10 + \\sum_{i } b_i \\sigma_{i}^z \\label{hhh}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the coupling strength between the _ _ i__th and the _",
    "_ j__th spin .",
    "@xmath12 is the pauli matrix of the _ _ i__th spin .",
    "@xmath13 are the static magnetic fields . from eq.([hhh ] ) , it is easy to get @xmath14=0 $ ] , where @xmath15 .",
    "so , @xmath16 is conserved .",
    "first , @xmath0 and @xmath1 is separated from the first qubit of c. the whole system is cooled to its ground state @xmath17 , in which @xmath18 denotes the spin down state(i.e.,the spin aligned -z ) .",
    "@xmath19(where @xmath20 ) denotes the _ _",
    "n__th spin up , and other spins down .",
    "the state that is transferrd is @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , alice encodes this state at @xmath0 , this state of the whole system is @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is a notation of the state of @xmath26 memories , @xmath27 which denotes the spin of the @xmath28th memory up and others down .    to make sure that the information is not destroyed by the measurement , we apply a cnot gate ( @xmath29 ) at @xmath1 , so @xmath30 is entangled , the state is latexmath:[\\[|\\psi(t_0=0)\\rangle=(\\alpha|10\\rangle + \\beta|01\\rangle)_{a_1,a_2 } \\otimes    then , we switch  on \" between @xmath1 and chain c , use the notation @xmath32 to represent the whole chain @xmath4 , and label the spins of @xmath32 as @xmath33(the 1st spin is @xmath1 , the @xmath34th spin is bob ) .",
    "generally , we suppose that the time spent on the switch is much shorter than the system dynamics . according to the dynamics dictated by eq.([hhh ] ) , the state eq.([cnot ] ) will evolve . at time @xmath35",
    ", the state is given as @xmath36 in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) between the first memory @xmath39 and bobqubit , to exchange the states .",
    "the state becomes @xmath40 @xmath39 has stored some information of the state and bob is at the state @xmath41 .",
    "then the whole spin chain continues to evolve , at time @xmath42 , perform a swap @xmath43 between bob s qubit and @xmath44 , the state is @xmath45 repeat this operation at time @xmath46 after the _",
    "_ j__th step , the state of the system can be described as @xmath47 in which , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "when the number of steps @xmath51 , all the excitation state in spin chain @xmath4 will be transferred to the memories , and the spin chain is at its ground state @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 decoding information from memories ----------------------------------    after the @xmath28th step transfer , what we should do is decoding the state @xmath53 from the memories .",
    "time - reversed protocol was introduced in ref.@xcite to recover the information .",
    "this protocol requires an another identical spin chain for decoding and spends the same amount of time as transfer portion .",
    "moreover , it is not conclusive transfer . here",
    ", we present a new decoding protocol which can achieve conclusive transfer and spend much less time than time - reversed protocol .",
    "cool the spin chain to the ground state @xmath54 , then switch  off \" between @xmath1 and c , and switch  on \" between @xmath0 and c. @xmath55 compose a new spin chain identical to @xmath4 and we label it as @xmath56 .",
    "let the spin chain evolve freely , at time @xmath35 , the state is given by @xmath57 then , apply a cnot gate at the qubit of @xmath39 controlled by bob s site being @xmath58 ( cnot:@xmath59 ) , the state is @xmath60 now , we measure the spin of @xmath39 .",
    "if the result is @xmath61 , the state of system is @xmath62 the state of bob s site is @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we have completed the task of quantum state transfer , and the probability is @xmath64 .",
    "for example , the spin chain with equal coupled strength @xcite",
    "@xmath65 if the result of measurement is @xmath18 , the state of system is @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the probability of failure for the first transfer . generally , for randomly coupled spin chain , @xmath68",
    ". by the measurement",
    ", we can determine whether the state of bob s site is @xmath53 . because the transfer is conclusive , and there are several measurements , it is more convenient to use the probability of successful transmission @xmath69 than the fidelity to measure the ability of transfer .",
    "if the first step of decoding failed , let the spin chain evolves freely , at time @xmath70 , apply a cnot gate at @xmath44 controlled by bob s site , and measure the qubit of @xmath44 . if the result is @xmath61 , the state of bob s site is @xmath71 , and the probability is @xmath72 if the result is @xmath73 , the state of bob s site is @xmath18 .",
    "then we repeat these operations at @xmath74,@xmath75 until the result of measurement of @xmath76 is @xmath61 .",
    "we introduce @xmath77 to denote the probability of successful transfer at @xmath28th step(the result of @xmath28th measurement is @xmath61 ) , and the probability of successful transfer within @xmath28 steps is @xmath78 .",
    "obviously , @xmath69 is an increasing function of @xmath28 . and",
    "it has been proved that perfect quantum state transfer can be achieved @xcite when @xmath51 .",
    "so , we conclude that when the number of memories used @xmath79 , and the number of decoding steps @xmath51 , the state can be perfectly transferred from alice to bob .",
    "[ transfer : firt ]   as a function number of spins @xmath80 of the chain.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ transfer : next ]   steps(measurements ) .",
    "the length of the spin chain is @xmath81 , the interval of time @xmath82 is chosen to make @xmath83 the maximum.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as an example , in this section , we consider the equal nearest - neighbor coupling spin chain .",
    "the hamiltonian of the chain(@xmath3 or @xmath4 ) is @xmath84 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors have been solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the probability of successful transfer within @xmath28 steps @xmath85 is a function of number of spins @xmath80 , the interval time at the @xmath86th step @xmath82 and @xmath28 . from eq.([jl ] ) , when @xmath87 , and for a certain @xmath80 , @xmath82 is chosen to make @xmath83 achieve its maximum , we get the maximal probability of successful transfer at the first step , as depicted in fig.[transfer ] .",
    "because of the dispersion of the information along the chain , transfer is not perfect when the number of spins is larger than @xmath88 , and the longer the spin chain , the less the maximal probability @xmath89 . in fig.[transfer2 ] , @xmath82 is also chosen to make @xmath83 maximal . and",
    "this figure shows that when the number of measurement @xmath28 ( number of decoding steps ) increases , the probability of successful transfer @xmath69 approaches @xmath58 for all n.    the number of memories used is determined by the probability of successful transfer @xmath69 that we requires and the transfer ability of the spin chain .",
    "if we take @xmath28 steps to transfer the information to the memories , the time spent is @xmath90 ,  burgarth @xcite and  giovannetti @xcite have made a timescale estimation for @xmath91 . in the decoding portion , if the decoding protocol is time - reverse , the time spent on decoding is @xmath91 , because all the @xmath28 steps should be finished to achieve the probability of successful transfer that we required .",
    "however , in our scheme , once the result of measurement of memories is @xmath61 , we can omit the following @xmath92 steps and complete the task of transfer .",
    "therefore , we should use the average decoding time to measure the time for decoding .",
    "@xmath93the probability of successful transfer within @xmath94 steps is @xmath95 , so we have the probability @xmath96 to go to the last decoding step . from fig.[transfer ]",
    ", the maximal probability of success is very large at the first step , i.e , when @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 . and from fig.[transfer2 ] , generally , @xmath83 is the decreasing function of @xmath86 .",
    "so , we expect that @xmath99 is obviously less than @xmath91 . for example",
    ", when @xmath100 .",
    "fifteen memories is needed to achieve the probability of successful transfer @xmath101 .",
    "the time spent on the transfer portion is @xmath102 , which is also the time spent on the decoding portion if we use the time - reversed protocol .",
    "however , in our scheme , the average decoding time is @xmath103 , which is only @xmath104 .",
    "because the information can be easily destroyed by measurement , conclusive transfer in a single spin chain was once thought to be unable @xcite . nevertheless , in our scheme , we successfully make it by using local memories storing the information and dividing the task into transfer portion and decoding portion .",
    "when the number of memories used and the decoding steps are infinite , our scheme can get perfect state transfer .",
    "especially , our scheme is much better than time - reversed protocol in some aspects .",
    "first , our scheme do not need another identical spin chain .",
    "second , considering the timescale , the average decoding time in our scheme is much less than the time - reversed protocol .",
    "third , our scheme is conclusive transfer .",
