    ", a detector made of such a material will be sensitive to the spin - dependent interaction , leading to a natural complementarity to existing detectors mainly sensitive to the spin - independent interaction . for massive wimps",
    ", the maximum recoil energy depends very weakly on the wimp mass as the  nucleus is much lighter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , the energy range in which all the sought events fall is @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the recoil energy range needs to be studied from energy threshold up to @xmath7 .",
    "this narrow range , for the searched events , represents a key point to discriminate these rare events from the background .",
    "the  presents in addition the following advantages with respect to other sensitive materials for wimps detection :    * a very low compton cross - section to gamma rays , two orders of magnitude weaker than in ge : @xmath8 barns for 10 kev @xmath9-rays  compared to @xmath10 barns in ge , * no intrinsic x - rays , * the neutron signature . the capture process @xmath11 gives very different signals with respect to the wimp events .",

    "the discrepancies can be even larger for some susy parameter space region .",
    "concerning the lower bound , it should be highlighted that one wants to keep models which provide a non negligeable relic density , that is to say neutralinos which can contribute significatively to the amount of cdm , but which not necessarily fill the entire amount of cdm .",
    "a lower bound on the @xmath4  mass can be derived from the upper bound on the @xmath4  relic density .",

    "the velocity distribution is assumed to be a standard isotropic maxwellian distribution in the galactic frame with an average rms velocity v truncated above the escape velocity of the galaxy .",
    "we assume no clumpy structures in the halo even if studies have been done in such cases  @xcite .",
    "the set of astrophysical parameters , commonly used  @xcite , for the susy parameter scan is :    @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "the neutralino @xmath4  being a majorana fermion , only the scalar ( via h and h in t - channel and @xmath60 in s - channel ) and the axial ( via z in t - channel and @xmath60 in s - channel ) interactions remain , the first one being called spin - independent ( si ) and the second one , the spin - dependent ( sd ) vanishing in the case of zero spin nuclei .  being an spin 1/2 nucleus is sensitive to the axial interaction with the neutralino .",
    "such an interaction is predominant on the scalar one for light nuclei such as  @xcite .",

    "it can be noticed that mimac - he3 would present a sensitivity for neutralino masses from @xmath69 6 to 200  for the expected background level .",
    "+ when the @xmath4  mass approaches 40  , the spin - dependent cross - section on  suddenly decreases .",

    "+ exclusion curves from ongoing detectors have been plotted  @xcite models accessible to mimac - he3 have been projected in this diagram and it can be seen how they are distributed .",
    "first , it can be noticed that sd and si cross - section values can be extremely different .",
    "some susy models lie below the limits from scalar detectors ( cdms , edelweiss ) whereas they provide a @xmath4  event rate in mimac - he3 higher than its background level . on the other hand , for such detectors",

    "projected exclusion curves are also presented .",
    "models visible by mimac - he3 remain unreachable even for large mass detectors .",
    "this point highlights the complementarity between sd and si direct dark matter detection .",
    "indirect detection techniques are based on the measurement of particle flux ( , @xmath9 , p , d , @xmath73 ) induced by pair annihilation of neutralinos .",
    "for instance , neutralinos can be captured gravitationally in celestial objects such as the sun or the earth and can annihilate in high energetic neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "earth signals are expected to be correlated to scalar direct detection due to the presence of even - even nuclei entering in earth composition whereas signals from the sun being made of both odd and even nuclei ( h , he ) should be correlated to axial and scalar direct detections . in the theoretical framework described above ( section 3.2 ) ,",
    "the possible complementarity of mimac - he3 with neutrino telescopes such as antares  @xcite or icecube  @xcite is investigated .",

    "it is usually taken at @xmath77  @xcite . as a comparison ,",
    "latest super - kamiokande results on wimp - induced upward muon flux from sun @xcite ( for a 50  wimp ) is of the order of @xmath78 , but with an energy threshold of 18 . in the case of mimac - he3 ,",
    "the background level is considered at @xmath65 .",
    "four regions can be separated in this figure .",
    "first , some models lie below the 2 expected background levels : they are not accessible . on the contrary",
    ", models in the upper right part of the figure should be seen via both detection methods .",
    "light neutralinos are expected to be visible only in mimac - he3 because they yield a muon flux well below the background level .      in the case of the si interaction ,",
    "the limits on the cross - section on the nucleus can be translated to bounds on the wimp - proton cross - section .",
    "the conversion is relatively straightforward given the fact that the wimp coupling to the nucleus is proportional to the square of the nucleus mass .",
    "the comparison of experimental results concerning the sd interaction is more problematic .",
    "since the spin of the target nucleus is carried both by constituent protons and neutrons , when converting to a wimp - proton cross - section a value of the ratio of the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron cross - sections must be assumed . but this ratio can vary significantly depending on the wimp composition .",
    "recently , a model - independent method  @xcite has been developed to enable comparison among sd direct searches of dark matter .",
    "the wimp - nucleon cross - sections @xmath79 are given by  @xcite , in the limit @xmath80 ( resp .",

    "as shown in  @xcite , the allowed values of @xmath85 , for a given wimp mass , are required to fall in the inside region defined by : @xmath86 in such a framework , exclusion curves are presented in the ( @xmath87 ) plane for a given wimp mass @xmath0 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are respectively the effective proton and neutron coupling strengths .",
    "consistent exclusion curves are 3-dimensional plot : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath0 . for detectors with one active nucleus , they are composed of two straight lines for which the gradient is given by the ratio @xmath90 . allowed values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 lie in between these two straight lines . consequently , the values of the spin contents of target nuclei are a key point for sd detection .",
    "commonly used values are recalled in table  [ table2 ] for the reader s convenience .",
    ".[table2]proton and neutron spin content values for various nuclei .",

    "the mimac - he3 projection ( red solid line ) allows to further constrain the current allowed region leading to a projected excluded region defined by the light gray region .",
    "only the white region should be left allowed with mimac - he3 .",
    "the downside plots present a zoom for wimp masses of 20 and 50  .",
    "it can be seen that mimac - he3 should allow to put much stronger constraints on the susy region , especially for light wimp masses for which other neutron based detectors provide much weaker constraints , due to threshold and target nucleus mass effects .",
    "+ in addition to be a model - independent framework , the ( @xmath87 ) diagram highlights the natural complementarity between various sd detectors .",
    "in particular , proton based ( @xmath92 ) and neutron based detectors ( , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) provide orthogonal constraints .",
    "furthermore , the sign of the @xmath95 ratio governs the sign of the slope thus giving another complementarity among neutron based detectors .",
    "+ however , due to the wide range for @xmath88 and @xmath96 , between experimental constraints and expected susy models , a more convenient representation would be obtained in the nucleon sd cross - section plane ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "two cases should then be distinguished depending on the sign of the ratio @xmath98  : the constructive ( positive sign ) or the destructive ( negative sign ) interferences .",

    "first , it should be noticed that , for a given experiment , there is a rather large difference between the two types of interferences in terms of experimental constraints . indeed , in the destructive case , some models with both high neutron and proton cross - sections may still remain unreachable to a given target nucleus , i.e. models lying inside the `` funnel '' .",
    "+ several exclusion curves are presented on figure  [ fig : sigpsigndirind ] , such as cresst ( dotted line ) , zeplin - i ( yellow solid line ) and edelweiss ( dashed line ) .",
    "these curves are obtained from calculation based on  @xcite . + the current excluded region ( light gray ) in this plane is given by the combination of theses curves .",
    "it also includes the limit from indirect dm detection ( @xmath73 telescopes ) .",
    "as said previously , the capture rate in the sun and thus the neutrino flux is exclusively sensitive to the sd cross - section on proton .",
    "therefore , a band along the @xmath99 axis is obtained .",
    "the super - k limit ( black solid line ) is displayed  @xcite on figure  [ fig : sigpsigndirind ] .",

    "this new project would be sensitive to susy regions not accessible by ongoing scalar detectors .",
