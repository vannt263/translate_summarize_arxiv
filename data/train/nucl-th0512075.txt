    "one of the interesting features of hadron production in heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) is the discovery of the scaling property of the pseudorapidity distribution in the fragmentation region over an order of magnitude of variation in the collision energy @xcite .",
    "such a property was hypothesized in @xcite for @xmath10 collision , and was referred to as limiting fragmentation . the independence on energy ,",
    "however , does not imply independence on the collision system .",
    "the pseudorapidity distributions in the fragmentation region show definitive dependence on the centrality of au+au collisions for any fixed energy @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can not expect on theoretical grounds that the properties of hadron production in that region should be the same in @xmath10 and @xmath11 collisions .",
    "whereas in @xmath10 collisions no particle can be produced with a rapidity greater than the beam rapidity , that is not the case in @xmath11 collisions .",
    "in fact , in terms of the variable @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the pseudorapidity and @xmath14 the beam rapidity , phobos data indicate that the charge - particle distribution @xmath15 does not vanish in the @xmath16 region @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to that region as the trans - fragmentation region ( tfr ) . in this paper",
    "we describe the physics of hadron production in the tfr in the framework of the recombination model .",
    "limiting fragmentation is a natural consequence of any formalism that uses momentum fractions of partons as the essential variables to describe hadronization since c.m .",
    "energy does not appear explicitly .",
    "however , particle production in the tfr is intriquing because it seems to violate momentum conservation , as it certainly would in @xmath10 collision . in @xmath11 collisions",
    "there are complications due to the fragments of the non - interacting spectators that can get into the detectors at small angles . for peripheral collisions at relatively low energy ( @xmath17 gev )",
    "@xmath15 seems to approach a constant value as @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "such effects seem to diminish at higher @xmath19 .",
    "let us put aside such issues , since our interest here is in the hadronization of the interacting part of nuclear collisions .",
    "for that , there is at present no data in the tfr for @xmath20 200 gev , say .",
    "nevertheless , it is an interesting and important question to ask whether there exists theoretical reasons for hadrons to be produced in the tfr .",
    "since the problem deals with low-@xmath3 physics , one can not make use of pqcd with any degree of confidence .",
    "nevertheless , if one takes the point of view that hadrons are produced in the fragmentations region ( fr ) by parton fragmentation , such as in the dual parton model @xcite , then no hadrons can appear in the tfr , since all partons have momentum fractions @xmath21 . on",
    "the other hand , in parton recombination the momentum fractions add and can result in a hadron momentum fraction greater than 1 , provided that the constituents come from different nucleons in the colliding system , a condition that is readily satisfied in @xmath11 collisions .",
    "it is with that possibility in mind that we study in detail the problem of hadron production in the tfr in the recombination model ( rm ) @xcite .",
    "nuclear collisions have the complication of momentum degradation of constituents traversing nuclear matter .",
    "we have investigated the degradation effect in @xmath22 collisions , treating the constituents in terms of valons @xcite , and found good agreement with the data on `` baryon stopping '' in the fr @xcite .",
    "here , in @xmath11 collisions the medium is dense , and our focus is in the tfr .",
    "nevertheless , similar formalism will be used to take the degradation effect into account .",
    "since hadronization is a problem that involves the momenta of the consituents in an essential way ( as does momentum degradation ) , we shall be working with the momentum fraction variable @xmath4 , instead of the pseudorapidity variable @xmath13 . in terms of @xmath4",
    "the tfr is more precisely @xmath23 , and the fr is for @xmath21 , but above , say , 0.2 .",
    "these regions do not map isomorphically to regions in @xmath13 , since @xmath3 is involved in the definition of angle @xmath24 . although @xmath13 is a more convenient variable for experimental detection , we shall work entirely in the @xmath4 variables .",
    "the mismatch between theory and experiment in that respect can be overcome only when the @xmath3 values of the detected particles are determined . until then",
    ", we can not compare our predictions with any data . in our treatment",
    "the physics of hadronization on both sides of @xmath25 is continuous , so we shall calculate the spectra in the region @xmath26 which we broadly refer to as tfr , as it roughly corresponds to the @xmath27 region ( although in principle , there is no upper limit on @xmath4 ) .    apart from details our main qualitative prediction is that protons dominate the charge particles detected in the tfr",
    ". such a prediction should be easier to confirm or falsify than the verification of our results on the inclusive distributions in @xmath4 .",
    "it is hoped that this paper will stimulate an effort to improve particle idenfication in the tfr .",
    "let us begin with the kinematics @xmath4 relevant for the tfr in hic at high energy . for hadrons detected at small angle @xmath24 relative to the beam axis",
    ", we may approximate @xmath28 by @xmath29 , where @xmath3 and @xmath30 are the transverse and longitudinal momenta , respectively , of the produced hadron .",
    "thus the pseudorappidity is @xmath31 , while the beam rapidity is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the proton mass . with @xmath6 being the shifted pseudorapidity , @xmath34",
    ", we have for feynman @xmath4 , defined by @xmath35 , @xmath36 the mapping between @xmath6 and @xmath4 therefore depends on @xmath3 . if in the forward region @xmath37 , then the @xmath16 region corresponds to a range in @xmath4 that straddles @xmath25 .",
    "for that reason we study the hadron spectra in the range @xmath38 as a representative of the tfr .",
    "next we consider the geometrical aspect of nuclear collisions .",
    "for convenience in identifying the forward direction , let us consider @xmath39 collision , and we are interested in the production of hadrons in the tfr of @xmath40 . in the glauber model",
    "we write for the cross section of @xmath39 collision in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int d^2s \\ , t_b(s ) \\left[1 - e^{-\\sigma t_a(|\\vec{s}-\\vec{b}| ) } \\right ] .",

    ", we consider only the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and call it @xmath48 . define @xmath49 to be the probability of @xmath40 having @xmath50 collisions in @xmath47 at impact parameter @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 then we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is",

    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) .",

    "( [ 11 ] ) , and the number of participants , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 , we have for @xmath11 collisions @xmath64 for au+au collisions at 200 gev , the tabulated values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are 1065 and 351 ( at 0 - 5% centrality ) , and are 220 and 114 ( at 30 - 40% ) @xcite .",
    "hence we get @xmath67    the impact parameters that correspond to the two centrality bins can be calculated from the overlap function @xmath68 using the simplified form for @xmath69 with uniform density in eq.([4 ] ) results in a distribution for @xmath70 that is slightly higher than the tabulated values for various centrality bins given in @xcite . nevertheless , from the shape of the distribtion the corresponding values of @xmath51 can reasonably be set at @xmath71    the consideration of nuclear geometry and the associated wounded nucleons will become important in the following when the momentum degradation effect is to be taken into account .",
    "in @xmath10 collisions no particle can be produced with @xmath72 . in @xmath39 nuclear collisions one would initially expect the same to be true also .",
    "however , @xmath73 nucleons in @xmath40 have a combined momentum of @xmath74 , which can make possible a particle produced with @xmath75 without violating momentum conservation , if a coherence effect is at work .",
    "that would be the case if the valence quarks in three nucleons in @xmath40 , each with momentum fraction @xmath76 , say , recombine to form a nucleon , whose feynman @xmath4 can then exceed 1 .",
    "it is also possible for a pion to be produced with @xmath77 , but since an antiquark in the sea ( or a gluon converted to @xmath78 ) is needed with large enough @xmath79 to recombine with a valence quark of another nucleon , the probability is much lower .",
    "this type of consideration need not be restricted to the @xmath77 region . even for @xmath80 , which we broadly refer to as tfr , the recombination of partons from different nucleons in @xmath40 will dominate over those processes where the partons are from the same nucleon , as in @xmath55 collisions . that dominance is over and above the shifted peak in rapidity due to `` baryon stopping '' simply on the basis of extra momentum availability in @xmath39 collisions . thus even without detail calculations we can predict that @xmath5 ratio is large in the tfr in @xmath39 collision . similarly , @xmath81 ratio is also large .",
    "hadron production at low @xmath3 and large @xmath30 in hadronic collisions has been treated in the rm in good agreement with data @xcite .",
    "the extension now to nuclear ( @xmath39 ) collisions with emphasis in the tfr region has the same basic recombination formula @xmath82 for the production of proton .",

    "if it were like in @xmath55 collision , then the quarks would all originate from the projectile , and the @xmath79 in @xmath97 would satisfy @xmath98 .",
    "however , in the tfr of @xmath39 collisions we consider the dominant component where each quark is from a separator nucleon in the same longitudinal tube at distance @xmath99 from the center of @xmath40 , so that we can write in the factorizable form @xmath100 with the labels @xmath101 and @xmath102 suppressed . on the lhs of eq.([21 ] ) we use ( [ 3 ] ) instead of @xmath40 in the superscript to emphasize that only 3 nucleons in @xmath40 are considered .",
    "how to generalize from 3 to @xmath40 will be discussed in sec .",
    "the effect of momentum degradation due to the passage through @xmath47 will be considered in the next section .",
    "the crucial point here is that the variables @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) are independent of one another , so the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) are from 0 to 1 for each @xmath79 .",

    "<S> we show how hadrons can be produced in that region when the hadronization process is parton recombination . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive @xmath4-distributions for proton and pion production are calculated with momentum degradation taken into account . </S>",
