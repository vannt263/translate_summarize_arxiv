    "as we know , markov chains as a mathematical model for stochastic systems play a fundamental role in computer science and even in the whole field of information science .",
    "a markov chain is usually represented by a pair @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a vector standing for the initial state of a stochastic system , and @xmath2 is a stochastic matrix characterizing the evolution of the system . over the past two decades , quantum computing and quantum information",
    "have attracted considerable attention from the academic community .",
    "then it is natural to study the quantum analogue of markov chains .",
    "actually , the terminology `` quantum markov chains '' have appeared many times in the literature @xcite , although it does not mean exactly the same thing in different references . a usual approach to defining quantum markov chains",
    "is to view a quantum markov chain as a pair @xmath3 where @xmath4 , a density operator , denotes an initial state of a quantum system , and @xmath5 is a trace - preserving quantum operation that characterizes the dynamics of the quantum system .",
    "this resembles very closely a classical markov chain represented by a pair @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , in the textbook @xcite , when quantum operations were introduced , they were viewed as a quantum analogue of markov processes . in @xcite ,",
    "a quantum markov chain means the same thing as mentioned here , while it mainly means a quantum walk in @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the quantum markov model reported in @xcite which is greatly different from the one mentioned above but will be shown to be very suited to describe hybrid systems that consist of a quantum component and a classical one .",
    "such a quantum markov chain can be roughly represented by a pair @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a transition matrix resembling @xmath2 in a classical markov chain but replacing each transition probability with a quantum operation and satisfying the condition that the sum of each column of @xmath7 is a trace - preserving quantum operation .",
    "@xmath8 , standing for the initial state of the model , is a vector with each entry being a density operator up to a factor .",
    "this model looks very strange at first glance , but it has the same expressive power as the conventional one given by @xmath3 .",
    "specially , we will show that this model is very suited to describe hybrid systems that consists of a quantum component and a classical one .",
    "indeed , hybrid systems are often encountered in quantum computing and quantum information , varying from quantum turing machines @xcite and quantum finite automata @xcite to quantum programs @xcite and quantum protocols such as bb84 .",
    "quantum engineering systems developed in the future will most probably have a classical human - interactive interface and a quantum processor , and thus they will be hybrid models . therefore , it is worth developing a theory for describing and verifying hybrid systems .",
    "in order to describe hybrid systems that receive inputs or actions from the outer world , we propose the notion of hybrid quantum automata ( hqa ) that generalize semi - quantum finite automata or other models studied by ambainis and watrous , and qiu etc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , these automata in the mentioned references as hybrid systems have been described in a uniform way by the authors @xcite .",
    "when viewing hqa as language acceptors , we show their language equivalence problem is decidable in polynomial time by transforming this problem to the equivalence problem of probabilistic automata",
    ". furthermore , we apply this result to the trace equivalence problem of quantum markov chains , showing the trace equivalence problem is also decidable in polynomial time .",
    "finally , we consider model checking linear - time properties of hybrid systems that are modeled by quantum markov chains .",
    "we show that the quantitative analysis of regular safety properties can be addressed as done for stochastic systems , by transforming it to the reachability problem that can be addressed by determining a least solution of a system of linear equations . for general @xmath9-regular properties ,",
    "the similar technical treatments used for stochastic systems no longer take effect for our purpose , and some new techniques need to be explored in the further study .",

    "as mentioned in introduction , it is natural to propose the quantum analogue of markov chains , while markov chains have been shown to play a fundamental role in information science and quantum information processing has attracted more and more attention from the academic community . in the literature , there are several notions of quantum markov chains defined from different perspectives , but in this paper we focus mainly on the one reported in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show that the quantum markov model given in @xcite is very suited to describe hybrid systems , although it has the same expressive power as the conventional one given in @xcite . before that",
    ", we recall some necessary definitions below .",
    "one natural viewpoint is to regard a quantum markov chain as a pair of a trace - preserving quantum operation and a density operator .",
    "here we keep up with the notations used in @xcite .    a quantum markov chain ( qmc ) is a triple @xmath87 where :    * @xmath10 is a hilbert space ; * @xmath5 is a trace - preserving quantum operation over @xmath10 ; * @xmath4 is the initial density operator over @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath88 is said to be finite if @xmath89 is finite .",
    "the physical interpretation of qmc @xmath88 is : a quantum system with hilbert space @xmath10 starts in the initial state @xmath4 , and at each step the state evolves according to @xmath5 .",
    "usually , we do not give explicitly the underlying hilbert space @xmath10 , and thus a qmc is simply denoted by the pair @xmath90 .",
    "the state at the @xmath78th step is denoted by @xmath91 .",
    "then we have @xmath92 where @xmath93 is inductively defined by : ( i ) @xmath94 and ( ii ) @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "another quantum analogue of markov chains was reported in @xcite , and we call it _ hybrid quantum markov chain ( hqmc)_. the reason why we called them `` hybrid '' will get clear soon . the definition is as follows .",
    "an hqmc is represented by a tuple @xmath97 where :    * @xmath10 is a hilbert space ; * @xmath26 is a nonempty and countable set of states ; * @xmath98 such that @xmath99 is a trace - preserving quantum operation for each @xmath100 .",
    "* @xmath101 denotes the initial distribution .",
    "@xmath88 is said to be finite , if @xmath26 and @xmath89 are finite .",
    "visually , hqmc @xmath88 can be represented by a transition graph ( a digraph ) where states from @xmath26 act as vertexes and there is an edge from @xmath102 to @xmath103 with label @xmath104 if and only if @xmath105 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ tgraph ] represents an hqmc whose state set is @xmath106 and whose transition function @xmath7 is given by @xmath107 where all given quantum operations are nonzero .        in the sequel",
    ", we identify the transition function @xmath7 with a @xmath108 matrix of which each entry is a quantum operation and the sum of each column is a trace - preserving quantum operation .",
    "@xmath104 denotes the entry in the @xmath103th row and the @xmath102th column .",
    "similarly , @xmath8 is viewed as a @xmath86-dimensional column vector with each entry being a positive operator and their sum being a density operator .",
    "@xmath109 denotes the @xmath102th entry .",
    "a rough interpretation of hqmc @xmath88 is : the system first starts in @xmath8 and then at each step evolves according to @xmath7 . at the @xmath78th step , the state is denoted by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is inductively defined by : i )",
    "@xmath112 is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries being @xmath113 and other entries being @xmath114 , and ii ) @xmath115 .",
    "note that the multiplication of an entry in @xmath7 and an entry in @xmath116 is in the sense of performing a quantum operation on a partial quantum state .",
    "for example , for @xmath117 we have @xmath118 for @xmath100 where quantum operation @xmath119 is performed on the state @xmath120 .    in the following ,",
    "we show that the model of hqmc @xmath97 is very suited to describe hybrid systems that are dynamic systems consisting of two interactive components : a quantum one and a classical one , although this might not be clearly noticed when the model was proposed at the beginning . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hqmc ] , there is a hybrid system consisting of a quantum component whose state space is @xmath10 and a classical component whose state set is @xmath26 .",
    "the behavior of this system is exactly described by @xmath88 .",
    "more specifically , at each step the hybrid system evolves as follows .    *",
    "firstly , depending on the current classical state @xmath102 , quantum state @xmath31 evolves according to @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath121 denotes the selective quantum operation described by the @xmath102th column of @xmath7 , that is , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , on input @xmath31 , the output is @xmath123 with probability @xmath124 . *",
    "secondly , the classical state @xmath102 evolves into state @xmath103 , where @xmath103 is the output of the above quantum evolution .",
    "equivalently , a transition function @xmath125 changes each state to @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath26 is finite , then the classical component can be viewed as a dfa whose state set and input alphabet are both @xmath26 and whose transition function maps the current state to the state indicated by the current input symbol .",
    "the initial state of the hybrid system is @xmath126 with probability @xmath127 where @xmath100 denotes the classical state .",
    "as shown above , the hqmc model is suited to describe hybrid systems .",
    "indeed , hybrid systems are often encountered in quantum information processing .",
    "for example , quantum programs can be regarded as hybrid systems , since as stated by selinger @xcite , quantum programs can be described by `` quantum data with classical control flows '' .",
    "quantum data are represented by states of the quantum component and classical control flows are state evolutions of the classical component .",
    "also note that the quantum turing machines defined in @xcite and quantum finite automata studied in @xcite are all hybrid systems .",
    "in addition , as shown in @xcite , quantum cryptographic protocols such as bb84 protocol can be described by hqmc .",
    "we think that hybrid systems will be encountered more often as the study of quantum information goes ahead .",
    "in fact , since what we can observe are classical , the quantum engineering systems developed in the future will most probably have a classical human - interactive interface and a quantum processor , and thus they will be hybrid systems .",
    "on should distinguish `` hybrid systems '' in this paper from those in @xcite .",
    "hybrid systems in @xcite are digital real - time systems embedded in analog environments .",
    "those systems combine discrete and continuous dynamics .",
    "there have been a long list of publications devoted to the verification of these hybrid systems .",
    "hybrid systems in our paper are such systems that combine classical discrete dynamics and quantum discrete dynamics ( it is also possible to consider quantum continuous dynamics ) , and in the sequel , when mentioning `` hybrid systems '' we always adopt this meaning . as mentioned above ,",
    "hybrid systems often present in quantum information processing .",
    "therefore , it could be meaningful and interesting to develop a theory of describing and verifying these systems ; feng et al s work @xcite can be seen as a first step toward this direction .    in the following ,",
    "we clarify the relationship between the two models of quantum markov chains presented in this section .",
    "first , a qmc is obviously a special hqmc , since when there is only one classical state in an hqmc , it reduces to a qmc . on the other hand , we will show that each hqmc can also be simulated by a qmc .",
    "this is formally expressed in the following theorem .",
    "given an hqmc @xmath128 , there exists a qmc @xmath129 such that the states @xmath91 and @xmath130 of @xmath131 and @xmath88 at the @xmath78th step , respectively , satisfy : @xmath132 for @xmath133 [ th:1 ]    _ proof . _",
    "the qmc @xmath129 is constructed as follows :    * @xmath134 where @xmath135 ; * @xmath136 ; * @xmath5 is a trace - preserving quantum operation on @xmath137 which is constructed to simulate the interactive actions between the quantum component and the classical one in fig .",
    "[ fig - hqmc ] .",
    "more specifically , @xmath5 is described by the set of operation elements @xmath138 where for each pair @xmath139 , @xmath140 are operation elements of the quantum operation @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath5 is trace - preserving since we have @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 denote identity operators on @xmath144 and @xmath10 , respectively . in the above , equation ( a ) holds because @xmath145 are operation elements of the selective quantum operation @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath146 , by a direct calculation we have @xmath147 from the above , it can be seen that the intuitive idea of @xmath5 is as follows : i ) first perform the measurement @xmath148 on the classical system to observe its state ; ii ) if @xmath102 is the result , then perform the selective quantum operation @xmath122 on the quantum system ; iii ) if the classical output of @xmath121 is @xmath103 , then perform @xmath149 on the classical system changing its state to @xmath103 . note that @xmath149 is a trace - preserving quantum operation for each @xmath150 , since it has operation elements @xmath151 that satisfy the completeness condition .    now by induction on @xmath78",
    "we prove @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "first when @xmath154 , we have @xmath136 .",
    "suppose it holds for @xmath78 . then from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) we have @xmath155 thus , we have completed the proof .",
    "+ from the above discussion , we know that qmc and hqmc have the same expressive power . however , they are suitable for describing different systems .",
    "while it is natural to describe a purely quantum system using the qmc model , it is convenient to describe a hybrid system using the hqmc model .",
    "based on the hqmc model , we propose an automaton model ",
    "hybrid quantum automata , which generalizes the models in @xcite and can be used to describe hybrid systems that receive inputs ( or actions ) from the outer world .",
    "first , some notations are explained below . as usual , for nonempty set @xmath156 , by @xmath157 we mean the set of all finite - length strings over @xmath156 .",
    "let @xmath158 where @xmath159 denotes the empty string . for @xmath160 , @xmath161 denotes the length of @xmath162 .",
    "let @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "a hybrid quantum automaton ( hqa ) is a tuple @xmath165 where    * @xmath10 is a hilbert space ; * @xmath26 is a countable nonempty set of states ; * @xmath156 is an alphabet of symbols ; * @xmath101 is the initial distribution ; * for each @xmath166 , @xmath167 such that @xmath168 is a trace - preserving quantum operation for each @xmath100 ;    @xmath169 is said to be finite , if @xmath26 , @xmath156 and @xmath89 are finite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath169 is roughly as : @xmath169 starts in @xmath8 , and at each step , it scans the current input symbol @xmath170 , and then updates its state according to @xmath171 . in this paper",
