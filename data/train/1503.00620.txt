    "ever since the proposal of the so - called higgs mechanism fifty years ago @xcite and , especially after the experimental findings and confirmations of the higgs particle during the last two years @xcite , the big question is how to calculate it s mass - because the standard model did not contain a recipe for that . to remedy this",
    ", we make a step towards a unification of the quantum chromo dynamics of strong interactions with the quantum flavor dynamics of electroweak interactions . to make the step , we digress from quantum field theory into a common @xmath0 configuration space where color and flavor are intermingled . at first sight",
    "this might seem confusing , but we shall show how one can project out both quark and gluon fields with the usual transformation properties .",
    "the standard model contains quite a few unexplained parameters such as the six quark mass parameters , the three angles and one phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix@xcite , the several coefficients and exponents of each parton distribution function and a similar wealth for the six leptons .",
    "the strong and electroweak interactions are described by seemingly independent gauge groups @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "baryons feel both interactions wherefore we seek a description from a common lie group background .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath0 which contains @xmath3 and @xmath4 as exemplar subsgroups . with this choice",
    "we can reduce considerably the number of parameters needed to describe baryon mass spectra and the higgs mass .",
    "we stress that the group @xmath0 is generated from three parametric momentum operators , three parametric angular momentum operators and three remaining runge - lenz - like operator components to connect the algebra .",
    "the six latter can be seen as intrinsic editions of the generators of the lorentz algebra@xcite . with three dimensions in laboratory space @xmath5 ,",
    "the group manifold @xmath0 therefore becomes the natural choice for intrinsic degrees of freedom that can be kinematically excited from laboratory space .",
    "the dynamics of the intrinsic degrees of freedom is projected back to laboratory space in the shape of quantum fields of various structures depending on the projection base chosen .",
    "a mixing between such projections becomes natural when one considers that the related subgroups are intermingled in the common @xmath0 configuration .",
    "this conception may open for a derivation of ckm - matrix elements although that is far beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we shall , however , make a first step to correlate the strong and electroweak interactions of baryons , namely in a derivation of the higgs mass .    in this paper , we derive fundamental mass values for higgs and gauge bosons and report on mass values for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 baryon spectrum with dynamics described from a lie group perspective .",
    "the derived higgs mass around 125 gev corresponds rather well to the recent experimental results @xcite as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgsmassgaussians ] and is based on just one dimensionful parameter in such a way that the ratio between the higgs mass and the electron mass , apart from mathematical constants , contains only the fine structure constant . of other papers analyzing the higgs mass are composite models like the one by dhar , mandal and wadia @xcite related to the gross - neveu model @xcite with a nambu - jona - lasinio type @xcite four - fermion coupling leading to a dynamically generated higgs mass without the need for an _ a priori _ higgs potential .    ) from a common lie group perspective for strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the curve widths represent the standard deviations of the respective mass peak determinations and not the resonance width which is much smaller @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one of us has previously introduced the lie group @xmath0 as configuration space @xcite .",
    "it contains the usual gauge groups @xmath1 of strong interactions and @xmath8 of electroweak interactions .",
    "the essential frame to be adopted here complies with local gauge symmetry when the intrinsic lie group dynamics is projected to laboratory space .",
    "each point @xmath9 in space is equipped with an intrinsic @xmath0 configuration space in which the fundamental dynamics is formulated with @xmath10 as configuration variable .",
    "thus our configuration space is orthogonal to the space - time manifold of the laboratory space .",
    "the closest analogue we can think of is that of intrinsic spin . in the present case",
    "the intrinsic space contains both color , spin , isospin and hypercharge degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus can capture both the strong and electroweak sections of baryon phenomena .",
    "a major motivation is to reduce the number of ad hoc mass parameters in baryon phenomena relative to the standard model . as a benefit of intermingling the gauge groups of the standard model in a common intrinsic space , the parameters in the higgs potential and the electroweak energy scale",
    "are determined from the relation to the intrinsic baryon potential - and the missing resonance problem in baryon spectroscopy vanishes .",
    "we do not expect to capture the meson sector since mesons are interaction quanta , i.e. field constructions in laboratory space .",
    "our basic frame is a hamiltonian structure on the lie group @xmath0 as a configuration space for baryons .",
    "we consider baryons as stationary states with masses @xmath11 determined as eigenvalues of @xcite @xmath12\\psi(u)=e\\psi(u)\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is our energy scale factor corresponding to a length scale @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath15 corresponds to the qcd energy scale factor@xcite , e.g. @xmath16 and is of the order of the pion decay constant@xcite @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is common for setting the scale in different phenomenological models @xcite . for our @xmath15",
    "the length scale @xmath14 was explicitly related@xcite to the classical electron radius@xcite @xmath18 by a mapping @xmath19 , between real parameter space and toroidal angles in the lie group , see fig .",
    "[ fig : projectiongroupalgabra ] .     as a measure for the extension of the charge `` scar '' created in the neutron decay .",
    "this corresponds excellently to the measured value for the neutron to electron mass ratio , see fig .",
    "[ fig : memnconvergence].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the @xmath15 above is calculated from a fine structure constant taken at nucleonic energies @xcite @xmath20 . in stead of the manton - inspired@xcite potential @xmath21 acting on the generators of the configuration variable we could have chosen a wilson - inspired@xcite potential @xmath22 taking the trace directly on the configuration variables themselves . both agree in the neighbourhood of the origo @xmath23 of @xmath0 but differ for larger deviations of the configuration variable .",
    "both will yield the same higgs and gauge boson masses but differ in the baryon mass spectra because the higgs mass is determined from the shared second order term near potential minima , where the algebra approximates the group , whereas the baryon states occupy all of the intrinsic geometry . therefore the manton - like potential better reproduces the baryon spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ndeltaspectrum ] .",
    "we also prefer the manton - like potential because , in the parametrization of the configuration space , it represents the euclidean measure folded onto the group manifold @xcite .",
    "note finally , as the configuration space is truly intrinsic , relativity only comes into play once the inherent dynamics in ( [ eq : schroedinger ] ) is projected to space as when the parton distribution functions in fig .",

    "the `` centrifugal '' term , can be integrated by exploiting the existence of the haar measure over @xmath73 by the factorization in ( [ eq : factorizedpsi ] ) below .",

    "of course this is only accurate if one chooses the same toroidal wavefunction for all members of a given multiplet . in practice",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in ( [ eq : okubo ] ) will be influenced by the @xmath89-dependence in the centrifugal term because different values of * k*@xmath90 * m*@xmath74 lead to different values of the centrifugal potential and thereby influence which span of toroidal energy eigenstates will project out on a specific angular momentum eigenstate in the laboratory .",
    "therefore , the @xmath72 symmetry break will not follow exactly ( [ eq : okubo ] ) in hypercharge .",
    "hadronic phenomena are traditionally described in the standard model with interactions shaped by the gauge groups @xmath91 of their strong color interactions and @xmath8 of their electroweak interactions .",

    "the parton distribution functions compare well with those established for the proton .",
    "because the dynamical structure is formulated on the lie group , it will show different manifestations depending on which derivatives ( [ eq : exteriorderivativedefinition ] ) one is taking .",
    "for instance , the three toroidal dimensions for the color quark degrees of freedom are intermingled with flavor degrees of freedom since the hypercharge and isospin 3-component generators @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath93 are not linearly independent of the three torodial generators @xmath94 . and",

    "rather we consider the baryons to be entire entities of introtangled energy - momentum which carry strong and electroweak manifestations intermingled .",
    "quarks ( [ eq : quarkdr ] ) and gluons ( [ eq : gluondphi ] ) come about when the intrinsic states are projected to laboratory space . in the language of the standard model we have confinement per construction since we take the configuration space to be compact .    \\2 .",
    "we consider the creation of electric charge to originate in topological changes ( [ eq : gp ] ) in the intrinsic states , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : reducedzone ] . as configuration space",
    "we take the lie group @xmath0 .",
    "it contains as intermingled subspaces exemplars of both @xmath4 , @xmath41 and @xmath1 structures , e.g. the gauge group @xmath1 of strong interactions and the gauge group @xmath401 of the electroweak interactions .",
    "we consider the strong and electroweak energy scales to be related by a balancing of color and higgs field energies ( [ eq : higgsansatz ] ) in the weak decay of baryons .",
    "we take the length scale of the strong interaction sector of the model to be settled in the projection of the neutron decay which relates changes in the intrinsic baryon states to the electroweak sector ( [ eq : periodicphipotential ] ) , ( [ eq : tildeenergyscale ] ) , ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "we thus take a projection of the intrinsic geometry to the electrically defined , classical electron radius as an input for the strong interaction scale with the electron imagined as a `` peel off '' from the neutron , leaving a `` charge scarred '' proton torus , see fig .",
    "[ fig : projectiongroupalgabra ] .",
    "further we use a trailing ansatz ( [ eq : higgsansatz ] ) to relate strong and electroweak coupling constants in order to set the scale ( [ eq : v ] ) for the electroweak sector and its higgs ( [ eq : higgsmass ] ) and gauge boson masses ( [ eq : mwandmz ] ) .",
    "states are projected from intrinsic space to laboratory space by use of the exterior derivative , the momentum form on the intrinsic manifold ( [ eq : exteriorderivativedefinition ] ) , respectively ( [ eq : quarkdr ] ) and ( [ eq : gluondphi ] ) . from projection of the intrinsic structure to space",
    "we recognize the toroidal generators as momentum operators ( [ eq : toroidalparametricmomentum ] ) and off - torus generators as spin and flavor operators ( [ eq : kandmcommutation ] ) , ( [ eq : m2spectrum ] ) . in experimental production of resonances we see from space : _ the impact momentum generates the abelian maximal torus of the @xmath0 intrisic space .",
    "the momentum operators act as introtangling generators_. when decay , asymptotic freedom , fragmentation and confinement are of concern we see from intrinsic space : _ the quark and gluon fields are projections of the vector fields induced by the momentum form on the intrinsic states_. the projected fields are treated as quantum fields and a balancing trailing ansatz between color and higgs field energies in weak baryon decays connects strong and electroweak sectors ( [ eq : higgsansatz ] ) via the period doublings ( [ eq : fpqrpair ] ) allowed in the parametrization of the intrinsic space .",
    "the structure of the period doublings and the intrinsic potential ( [ eq : periodicpotential ] ) determines the higgs potential from which the higgs mass originates .",
    "\\5 . because the dynamical structure is formulated on the lie group",
    ", it will show different manifestations depending on which derivatives ( [ eq : exteriorderivativedefinition ] ) one is taking .",
    "for instance we interpret the three toroidal dimensions as intrinsic color quark degrees of freedom ( [ eq : dphi ] ) , ( [ eq : psivector ] ) .",
    "these are intermingled with flavor degrees of freedom . and",
    "both are intermingled with the eight gluon dimensions laid out by the gell - mann matrices ( [ eq : gluondphi ] ) .",
    "thus we do not consider color and flavor degrees of freedom as being independent .",
    "as mentioned in subsec .",
    "2.2 , the distribution functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : partondistribution ] are produced by using the exterior derivative ( [ eq : dphi ] ) on tracks @xcite from the quark flavor generators @xmath95 and @xmath96 . and",
    "the reduction in the number of independent quark degrees of freedom practically eliminates the missing resonance problem in ordinary qms , compare figs .",
    "[ fig : ndeltaspectrum ] and [ fig : missingresonances ] .",
    "the neutral flavor , neutral electric charge baryon singlets mentioned in sec . 4 and listed in table [ tab : singlets ] should be sought for .",
    "they may even lie dormant in data pools already taken since they have no charged partners to help them surface in partial wave analysis .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the coupling constant @xmath402 at @xmath131-bosonic energies is wanted for an even more accurate prediction of the higgs mass @xmath272",
    ".    a suitable base on which to expand for exact solutions for charged baryons is wanted in order to improve the predictions on the n and @xmath7 mass spectrum .",
    "the geodetic distance potential ( [ eq : mantontracepotential ] ) can be used as an interaction term .",
    "for instance in a model for two baryons with configuration variables @xmath32 and @xmath403 for which @xmath404 .",
    "thus we conjecture the deuteron to be the spin 1 ground state of @xmath405\\psi(u , u')=e\\psi(u , u').\\ ] ] when one imagines a projection of the term @xmath406 it has an antiquark - quark structure characteristic of mesons in that the @xmath407 when projected is to be represented on an antiquark to the left and the @xmath403 is to be represented on a quark to the right .",
    "we have derived the higgs mass and the electroweak energy scale by connecting structurally the strong and electroweak baryon sector .",
    "we have considered baryons as entire entities on an intrinsic @xmath0 configuration space with a hamiltonian structure to yield baryon mass spectra .",
    "the parametrization of the intrinsic baryon space and its potential allows for period doublings which determines the higgs potential and settles the higgs mass .",
    "parton distribution functions follow from the exterior derivative , the momentum form on intrinsic states .",
    "the general agreement of the various derivations with experimental observations suggests further investigations within the model .",
    "in particular a base for exact solutions of electrically charged baryonic states is wanted as well as experimental investigations looking for neutral flavor , neutral charge baryon singlets particular for the present model . the singlets should be visible as resonances in negative pions scattering on protons , in photoproduction on neutrons , in neutron diffraction dissociation experiments and in invariant mass spectra of protons and negative pions in b - decays .",
    "the higgs mass prediction , the singlet predictions and the elimination of a missing baryon resonance problem distinguish the present model from the standard model predictions .",
    "we await singlet searches on gev - machines from new experiments or from dedicated analysis on existing data pools and we await more accurate higgs mass measurements from run 2 at the large hadron collider .",
