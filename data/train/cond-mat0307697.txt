    "over the years , there have been many attempts to develop adequate approximations for properties of elementary excitations in disordered systems . among these phonons",
    "are not only conceptually the simplest , but are also the most readily accessible to experimental verification . neutron scattering experiments @xcite have provided detailed information about lattice vibrations in random alloys .",
    "a satisfactory reliable theory is still lacking .",
    "the main reason for this is that , unlike the case of electrons in substitutionally disordered alloys , where the hamiltonian can be expressed in a form where the disorder is _ diagonal _ in a real space representation ( this is certainly true , for example , in a lmto formalism in the absence of local lattice distortions ) , the disorder in the dynamical matrix is essentially _ off - diagonal_. to make things more complicated , the diagonal and off - diagonal disorders in the dynamical matrix are coupled by the force constant sum rule @xmath3 , which ensures that no vibration can be excited in a uniform translation of the crystal as a whole .",
    "this sum rule imposes an _ environmental disorder _ on the force constants .",
    "that is , the disorder in the diagonal element of the dynamical matrix depends upon its near neighbours or its immediate environment .",
    "hence a reliable theory for phonon excitations will be that which includes all the three kinds of disorders explicitly .",
    "let us look at the most successful mean field approximation : the single - site coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , introduced first by taylor @xcite .",
    "as the name itself suggests , it is a single site approximation and per se can not deal adequately with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "several authors have proposed schemes for generalizing the cpa and their approaches include geometrically scaled off - diagonal disorder @xcite , linearly scaled off - diagonal disorder @xcite and independent diagonal and off - diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "most of these schemes in practice lead to a single site cpa including off - diagonal disorder .",
    "these approaches suffer from two different kinds of drawbacks : first , there is no reason why the off - diagonal part of the dynamical matrix should scale either as the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean of the constituents .",
    "secondly , often the extra assumptions lead to approximate green functions which violate the essential herglotz analytic properties required to produce physically acceptable results .",
    "a complex function @xmath4 of a complex variable @xmath5 is said to possess herglotz analytic properties provided it satisfies the following properties @xcite,@xcite :    ( i ) : :    the function is analytic everywhere in the complex    @xmath5-plane , expect on the real @xmath5-axis .",
    "all    its singularities therefore lie on the real @xmath5-axis .",
    "( ii ) : :    the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath4 is negative    everywhere on the upper half of the @xmath5-plane and positive    everywhere on the lower half of the @xmath5-plane .",
    "( iii ) : :    if the set of singularities of @xmath4 is bounded , then    @xmath6    the augmented space approach suggested by mookerjee @xcite provided a very interesting starting point for the generation of appropriate approximations .",
    "the 2-site cpa proposed by yussouff and mookerjee @xcite for model systems and subsequently generalized by mookerjee and singh @xcite to realistic alloys was one successful approach . while it retained the herglotz properties of the approximate green functions , the generalization of the 2cpa to larger clusters violated the lattice translational symmetry of the _ configurationally averaged _ green function for homogeneous disorder .",
    "this was overcome subsequently by the traveling cluster approximation of kaplan and gray @xcite also based on the augmented space method .",
    "recently , ghosh _ et.al _ @xcite have proposed a nearest neighbour traveling cluster cpa and have applied it to phonons in nipt and nipd alloys . in this communication",
    "we shall propose a different approximation procedure .",
    "we shall start from the augmented space method and use the recursion method of haydock _ et.al _",
    "@xcite to obtain the configurationally averaged green functions .",
    "the termination of the continued fraction expansion will constitute the approximation .",
    "this will not only retain the herglotz analytic properties of the approximate averaged green function , but also include the effect at a site of its neighbourhood , the size of which we can control .",
    "we shall incorporate the effect of the very distant environment by the use of accurate _",
    "termination schemes _ proposed e.g. by haydock @xcite , luchini and nex @xcite or beer and pettifor @xcite . since we shall incorporate the lattice translation symmetry in the full augmented space ( which is characteristic of homogeneous disorder ) @xcite within our approach , the drawback of the original cluster - cpas used by singh and mookerjee @xcite will be overcome .",
    "further , we shall use the local point group symmetries of the lattice and the configurations on it to drastically reduce the rank of the hilbert space on which the recursion takes place ( see saha _ et.al _",
    "@xcite ) . this will allow us to accurately account for large environments around a particular site .",
    "one of the strengths of the proposed method which will represent a major step forward in the theory is the possibility of including random fluctuations in force constants beyond the nearest neighbours . while in certain representations",
    "the hamiltonian of electronic systems can be seen to be short - ranged , this is not so for dynamical matrices .",
    "the recursion method in augmented space can include beyond nearest neighbour randomness in force constants without much computational expense . in our work on nipt and nipd",
    "we have extended disorder upto second nearest neighbours to illustrate this .",
    "it is not immediately clear how easy it would be to extend the method proposed by ghosh _",
    "et.al _ to larger sized clusters .",
    "we propose the asr as a computationally fast and accurate technique which will incorporate configuration fluctuations over a large local environment .",
    "+ in section ii , we shall introduce the basic formalism . in sections iii we shall present results for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 alloys and compare them with experiment .",
    "the choice of the systems is deliberate : nipd has predominantly mass disorder , nicr predominant disorder in the dynamical matrix ; nipt has large disorder _ both _ in the mass and the dynamical matrix .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section iv .",
    "the basic problem in the theory of phonons is to solve a secular equation of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fourier transform of @xmath9 , the displacement of an atom from its equilibrium position @xmath10 on the lattice , in the direction @xmath11 at time @xmath12 .",

    "the asf has been described in great detail earlier @xcite .",

    "the first operation is to represent the random parts of the secular equation in terms of a random set of local variables @xmath39 which are 1 if the site @xmath10 is occupied by an a atom and 0 if it is occupied by b. the probability densities of these variables may be written as :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the concentrations of the constituents a and b with @xmath43 .",

    "several terminators are available and we have chosen to use that of luchini and nex @xcite . if we calculate the coefficients up to the @xmath104-th step exactly the first @xmath105 moments of the density of states are reproduced exactly .",
    "the terminator ensures that the approximate green function has herglotz analytic properties which also tells us that the approximate density of states is always positive definite and the spectrum is always real .",
    "the terminator is also so chosen that the asymptotic moments are also accurately reproduced .",
    "this is a generalization of the method of moments , with the additional restriction that the asymptotically large moments are also accurately obtained .    in the absence of disorder in the problem ,",
    "the green function for a given mode is of the form :    @xmath106    the spectral function @xmath107 is a delta function of the form @xmath108 . if we write : @xmath109    then ,    @xmath110    obviously from above @xmath111 is the disorder induced self - energy .",
    "damped vibrations occur with reduced frequencies at @xmath112 which are the solutions of the implicit equation  :    @xmath113    and their disorder induced widths are :    @xmath114    the average spectral function @xmath115 for a mode labelled @xmath116 is related to the averaged green function in reciprocal space as :    @xmath117\\ ] ]    the averaged density of states is given by :    @xmath118    here @xmath116 labels the particular normal mode branch and bz is the brillouin zone .",
    "the dispersion curves for different modes are then obtained by numerically calculating the peak frequencies of the spectral function . this averaged spectral function gives , in principle , a proper description of the dynamics but it does not involve any weighting by scattering lengths .",
    "the dispersion curves so obtained are nearly the same as those obtained experimentally from the peak frequencies of the coherent structure factors @xmath119 .",
    "this is because the coherent structure factors are nothing but the averaged green functions weighted by the coherent scattering lengths .",
    "the intensities and the line shapes measured from @xmath120 and the imaginary part of green function may differ significantly , but the peak positions will generally differ little .",
    "experimental determination of the phonon dispersion and line - widths are deduced from the averaged coherent scattering structure factors .",
    "the expression for these can be written as  :    @xmath121    here , thermal neutrons with wave - vector * k * gets scattered to final state of wave - vector * k@xmath122 * , * q * = * k**k@xmath122*+*q * with * q * being a reciprocal lattice vector . the energy lost by the incoming neutrons",

    ", it does affect the line - shapes and line widths .",
    "we can easily implement such an average within the asf  :    @xmath130    where    @xmath131    carrying out algebra similar to the one for the averaged green function , we obtain :    @xmath132    where ,    @xmath133    with ,    @xmath134    also    @xmath135  and  @xmath136    where ,    @xmath137    the subsequent recursion calculation follows the identical steps as for the averaged spectral functions .",
    "we have chosen a second neighbour force constant model , with dynamical matrices fitted to reproduce the dispersion curves .",
    "the disorder induced widths are the quantities which are more sensitive to the effect of randomness as compared to the frequencies ( i.e.  dispersion curves  ) , and as such will be one of the focus of this work . in order to extract the full width at half maxima (  fwhm  ) ,",
    "we have fitted the coherent structure factors to lorenzians exactly as the experimentalists do to extract the same .",
    "the advantage of including the scattering length fluctuation will be clear when we will show the nature of the line widths for @xmath0 alloy with and without inclusion of the scattering length fluctuation ( i.e.  calculating the widths once by fitting the spectral functions to lorenzians and then the structure factors to lorenzians  ) . our aim in this communication is to propose the augmented space recursion as a useful technique to study effects of diagonal , off - diagonal and environmental disorder .",

    "agreement can be achieved by varying only one parameter in the force constant matrix .",
    "this suggests that the force constant disorder is weak and the system is dominated by the mass disorder , as is clear from the numerical values of the parameters given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "if one looks at the previous results for the dispersion curves (  i.e.   vca , cpa and icpa curves  ) @xcite , it will be clear that in the low wave vector regime , there is no distinction between these results and ours , because the self averaging of both mass and force constants over a single wavelength reduces the cpa , icpa and the asr results to become close to the vca .",

    "the reason is that vca uses an averaged mass .",
    "in contrast to this , for those theories which capture the effect of mass fluctuation ( as do the icpa and the asr ) , the lighter atoms ( ni in this case ) dominate in the high wave vector region and push the frequencies up .",

    "our results show very strong branch and wave - vector dependent widths and in good agreement with the experimental results of kamitakahara and brockhouse except in the [ @xmath152l mode .",

    "looking at the dispersion curves , one should notice that the behaviour of the natural widths were somehow complemented in the behaviour of the frequencies .",
    "there is little evidence of resonances .",
    "this is expected , since clear cut resonances are characteristics of large mass disorders only .    in figure [ widnicr ]",

    "being encouraged by the right trend of theoretical results toward the experimental results in the ni@xmath147pd@xmath148 and ni@xmath160cr@xmath161 alloys , where either of the two disorders  diagonal and off - diagonal dominates , we now apply our formulation to nipt alloys where both disorders are predominant .",
    "the mass ratio m@xmath169/m@xmath170 is 3.3 ( quite large compared to previous alloys ) and the nearest neighbour force constants of pt are on an average 55% larger than those in ni .",

    "@xcite have studied this system thoroughly covering a wide range of concentration ( @xmath41=0.05 ,  @xmath41=0.3 ,  @xmath41=0.5 ) by inelastic neutron scattering . in our case , we have considered x=0.5 where we expect the disorder induced scattering to have the strongest effect .    in this case , the spectral functions as well as the structure factors show few extra features : even in [ @xmath158 0 0 ] l , [ @xmath158 0 0 ] t and [ @xmath158 @xmath158 0]t2 modes , unlike the previous two cases both the functions have one usual well defined peak ( observed more clearly in the middle - regime of the brillouin zone ) along with a weakly defined peak with no gap in between .",
    "the occurrence of such a weakly defined peak is due to the inclusion of force constant disorder .",
    "( @xcite ) have argued that it is entirely because of the off - diagonal disorder in the force constants .",
    "we refer the reader to their paper for the detailed arguments . here",

    "we have used the same parametrization of the force constants as used by ghosh _",
    "et al_. these dispersion curves ( solid lines ) are compared with that calculated in the icpa ( filled circles ) by ghosh _",
    "the aim of this work was to establish the asr as a computationally fast and accurate method for phonon calculations for random alloys .",
    "our ultimate goal is to obtain the force constants from first principles calculations .",
    "for all the three panels the thin dotted lines indicate the fwhm s . unlike the previous two cases , the dispersion curves in this case have very different characteristic features .",
    "the splitting of the curves in all the three symmetry directions is the main feature .",
    "this is due to strong resonances , a feature of large mass disorder . also as one can see that near the resonances ( around 4 thz ) the fwhm becomes very large",
    "tsunoda finds this resonance near 3.8 thz , while the cpa gives a rather lower value of 3 thz .",
    "in addition to these features , it has been observed that around 7 thz , the structure factor has a third small peak split from the main branch .",
    "this evidence of a weak resonance was also speculated by mookerjee and singh ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overall agreement of our dispersion curves with those calculated in the icpa is good .",
    "we have set up the augmented space recursion in reciprocal space for the study of phonon dispersion and disorder induced line - widths and line - shapes for random binary alloys .",
    "the technique takes into account both diagonal disorder in the masses , the off - diagonal disorder in the force constants and the environmental disorder in the diagonal term of the force constants arising out of the sum rule .",
    "the approximation involving termination of continued fraction expansions of the green function retains the essential herglotz analytic properties .",
    "we have applied the method to three classes of alloys : nipd where mass disorder dominates , nicr where force constant disorder dominates and nipt where both dominate .",
    "wherever possible we have compared our results with neutron scattering data as well as the most sophisticated mean field theory recently proposed by ghosh _ et.al _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "both qualitatively and quantitatively our results agree well with the available data .",
    "we propose the technique as a computationally efficient method for the study of phonons in disordered systems .",
    "our approach here made no attempt to obtain the force constant themselves from first principles , but rather resorted , as others did earlier , to fitting them from experimental data on the constituent metals .",
    "our future endeavor would be to rectify this , and attempt to obtain the dynamical matrix itself from more microscopic theories .",
