    "the reservoirs of gas and dust found orbiting most sun - like stars with ages on the order of a million years  also known as t tauri stars ( tts )  are now subjects of intense study , as they likely hold the secrets to the formation history of the solar system and other planetary systems .",
    "the evolution of the observable characteristics of these planet forming disks and the underlying phenomena responsible for their detectability may provide the necessary insight to further our understanding of planet forming processes and to determine the likelihood of the formation of planetary systems around sun - like stars .    the existence of circumstellar disks accompanying young low mass stars previously has been inferred by the presence of detectable emission from trace constituents of these disks ( i.e. , dust and gaseous molecules other than h@xmath3 ) .",
    "the earliest attempts to determine the fraction of stars that possess disks in young star forming clusters focused on their near - infrared continuum @xcite and submillimeter continuum emission @xcite .",
    "circumstellar disks possessing warm ( @xmath5  @xmath2  1000  k ) micron - sized dust grains within @xmath2  1  au of the pre - main sequence stars produce near - infrared emission in excess of that predicted for the stellar photosphere , while circumstellar disks possessing cold , micron - sized dust grains at radii of several tens of au produce excess radiation at mid - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths . from surveys such as these ,",
    "astronomers have determined the lifetime of warm dust grains in the inner disks to be 3 - 6  myr @xcite .",
    "similarly , observations of cold ( @xmath5  @xmath2  10 - 100  k ) gas molecules ( e.g. , co , hcn@xmath6 , etc ) from the outer regions of the disks @xcite tend to support the disk lifetime estimates drawn from near - infrared surveys .",
    "more recently , new disk fraction and lifetime surveys of tts in nearby star forming regions have been conducted utilizing the infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) aboard the _ spitzer space telescope_. these instruments are capable of detecting emission from dust grains ( @xmath5  @xmath2  100 - 300  k ) located at intermediate disk radii , a region of these disks to which the previous photometric surveys were insensitive .",
    "@xcite took a census of 230 sources identified as weak - line tts  weakly or non - accreting tts possessing either a passive , optically thin disk or no circumstellar material  in the lupus , ophiuchus , and perseus molecular clouds .",
    "they find a higher disk frequency for the sources located in the highest extinction regions of the clouds , suggesting that the wtts at the edges of the formation regions are slightly older and more evolved .",
    "although they find @xmath2  20% of these possess some circumstellar material , @xmath2  50% of what appear to be the youngest stars in the sample show no evidence of disks .",
    "these results , which are consistent with other _ spitzer",
    "_ surveys of low mass star forming regions @xcite , lead them to conclude , based on the existence of detectable emission from cool dust grains , that disk lifetimes are less than ten million years , which roughly agrees with the conclusions about disk lifetimes drawn from near - infrared surveys . given the chaotic environment near these young stars and the phenomena ( i.e. , accretion , photoevaporation , stellar and disk winds , close encounters with other cluster members ) that conspire to destroy these disks ,",
    "the lifetimes measured from these surveys can be explained by disk dissipation models including all or some of these processes @xcite .    despite the growing consensus",
    "that disk lifetimes are only a few million years that has been drawn from several different techniques for studying circumstellar disks , astronomers must remain cautious when inferring the presence or absence of disks based upon the detectability of disk tracers ( i.e. , dust and co emission ) because the majority of the disk mass is composed of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) .",
    "as these disks evolve according to the core accretion model of planet formation , the small micron - sized dust grains accumulate into larger bodies , which will change the wavelength dependence of the dust emissivities and the collective surface area of dust grains emitting at wavelengths in the near - infrared .",
    "since a planetesimal must reach a mass of @xmath7  10 earth masses before it can gravitationally collect h@xmath3 gas from the disk , the main component of the disk must persist , while planetesimals accrete into km - sized objects and disk tracers disappear , in order for gas giant planets to be the result of the core accretion scenario of planet formation .",
    "therefore , in an accretionally - evolved system in which small dust grains have coagulated into larger planetesimals , an evolutionary stage should exist during which both the near - infrared and mid - infrared excesses will have diminished substantially while the massive gaseous component remains present .    in previous work , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite searched a variety of tts , predominantly wtts , in the nearby taurus - auriga , @xmath8 ophiuchus , and tw hya association star forming regions for emission signatures from h@xmath3 persisting in such accretionally evolved circumstellar disks . using various high - resolution , near - infrared spectrometers , narrow line emission centered at the @xmath9 transition rest wavelength of 2.1218  @xmath10 m was detected from several tts stars ; some were known to possess circumstellar disks ( tw  hya , gg  taua , and lkca  15 ) , and one was previously thought to be devoid of any circumstellar material ( doar  21 ) .",
    "the detection of quiescent emission from the disk of a wtts with no other detectable disk tracers suggests that the gaseous component may indeed persist as the disk evolves .",
    "however , we estimate the mass of hot h@xmath3 gas producing the observed features in these sources to be in the range 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12  m@xmath13 . for at least three of these four sources",
    ", a substantial reservoir of h@xmath3 gas exists in their disks suggesting that the near - infrared h@xmath3 emission feature , is itself only a tracer of the disk gas . in the time since these detections were made , several other authors searching for the same emission signature also have detected h@xmath3 gas @xcite . in two of the three additional sources toward which h@xmath3 was detected ( lkh@xmath4  264 and echa j0843.3 - 7905 ) ,",
    "the emission lines were similarly centered at 2.1218  @xmath10 m , with full - width at half of maximum ( fwhm ) only slightly larger than those reported for the previous four detections . in the case of dg  tau",
    ", @xcite reported the detection of an h@xmath3 emission line blueshifted by 15  km  s@xmath14 and possessing a fwhm of @xmath2  35  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the authors also show that the emitting gas is extended along the axis of a strong outflow previously observed from this source .",
    "therefore , the emitting gas from this source is most likely associated with the outflowing gas distinguishing this detection from the others .",
    "in addition to these detections of rovibrational emission , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have detected h@xmath3 emission from the mid - infrared pure rotational transitions from the herbig aebe stars , ab  aur and hd  97048 , with a similarly quiescent kinematic signature .    here , we present five more detections of h@xmath3 near - infrared emission from both classical and weak - line tts , an infrared companion ( irc ) , and a detection from a herbig aebe star in the chamaeleon i star forming region .",
    "in addition , we place an upper limit on emission from a second line of h@xmath3 at 2.2477  @xmath10 m for two of these sources .",
    "we review the possible stimulation mechanisms with respect to recent x - ray and uv irradiated disk models .",
    "we find that two of our past detections and one of the present detections possess transitional disks  disks with large inner disk holes devoid of emission from small warm dust grains .",
    "two of these transitional disk sources also possess detectable emission from a mid - infrared [ ne  ii ] emission line predicted to be a tracer of high energy photons and a signature of photoevaporation , a mechanism thought to be potentially responsible for the presence of the inner disk holes of the transitional disks .",
    "kinematic information from the h@xmath3 emission features suggest that the emitting gas extends to within a few au of each source , demonstrating for the sources with inner disk holes that gas remains despite the lack of dust emission .",
    "we estimate the location of the regions within the disks where potential excitation photons deposit their energies and find agreement with the location of emitting gas determined from the velocity dispersion of the line .",
    "finally , we relate the detection of quiescent h@xmath3 emission to accretion activity and , possibly , the evolutionary status of the dust grain population .",
    "we obtained high spectral resolution ( r  @xmath7  60,000 ) near - infrared spectra of thirteen tts ( table  1 ) in the chamaeleon  i star forming region on 2003 january 7 - 18 , ut , using the phoenix spectrometer @xcite in queue - mode on the gemini south 8-m telescope atop cerro pachon in chile .",
    "phoenix utilizes a 256  @xmath15  1024 pixel section of a 1024  @xmath15  1024 pixel insb aladdin ii detector .",
    "most of our spectral observations were centered at 2.1218  @xmath10 m and were made using a 14  long , 017 ( 2 pixel ) wide slit , which result in nominal instrumental spatial and velocity resolutions of 005 and @xmath2  5 km s@xmath14 , respectively . for the observations of the two faintest sources ,",

    "the lack of bulk motion of emitting h@xmath3 gas along the line of sight and with respect to the systemic velocity of the stars is interpreted as evidence that the gas is not entrained in a fast moving wind or outflow associated with any of these young sources .",
    "additionally , the lack of extended emission beyond the full - width of the spectral beam indicates that the emitting gas is confined to regions within @xmath2  80  au of the stars  with the exception of binary glass ia and ib , in which the emission extends between the companions .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , in all cases except glass  i , the emitting h@xmath3 is quiescent gas residing in the circumstellar disks associated with these sources , and is not shocked , spatially extended gas , as has been observed toward other class  i sources and tts ( e.g. , t tauri , dg  tau ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the glass  i binary appears to be an exceptional source with its extended emission .",
    "the small , but resolved fwhm measured for the quiescent emission features must be broadened by the keplerian rotation of the gas as it orbits the central sources , since thermal broadening would require temperatures @xmath18  6000  k. using the same technique @xcite and @xcite used to estimate the inner truncation radius of the gas disk using co emission features , we used the velocity shift of h@xmath3 gas at the outermost edges of the gaussian - shaped features , referred to as the half - width at zero intenisty ( hwzi ) , to estimate the innermost radius at which the detected h@xmath3 gas resides . assuming an inclination angle of 45@xmath45 , the main sequence mass corresponding to the spectral type of each source , and estimating the maximum orbital velocity of gas from the hwzi , we calculated the inner radii for gas in the disks of cs  cha and sz  33 to be 2.5 and 0.9  au , respectively , while for the more massive stars , cv  cha and hd  97048",
    ", we find 3.2 and 5.5  au .",
    "we note that these radii represent the innermost regions of the disks from which the emission arises and accounts for only a fraction of the overall line emission .",
    "we conclude that the bulk of the emitting gas resides outside of these disk radii .",
    "the results we have found for the distances from the stars at which the hot h@xmath3 emission is generated is similar to that found by @xcite , who found fwhm of 9 - 14  km  s@xmath14 for several k type stars , placing the bulk of the emitting gas at about 10  au , by @xcite , who found a line width of @xmath2  18  km  s@xmath14 for a single m3 star ( echaj0843.3 - 7905 ) and by @xcite , who found a line width of 8.5  km  s@xmath14 for a single aebe star ( ab  aur ) . in all of these cases ,",
    "the h@xmath3 gas emitting in rovibrational or pure rotational lines is not found close to the star ( inside of 1  au ) nor at great distances from the stars , suggesting that processes exciting this emission is most effective at intermediate distances of a few to a few tens of au from these stars .",
    "assuming that the emitting h@xmath3 gas is optically thin , we have used equation  2 from @xcite , the measured line fluxes ( see table  2 ) , and a distance of 160  pc to chamaeleon  i , to calculate the masses of ` hot ' h@xmath3 gas producing the line emission .",
    "we find that these masses fall within the range 10@xmath46 , in agreement with previous estimates @xcite . on their own ,",
    "these masses do little for informing us about the total mass of gas in the system or the total disk mass unless we understand the physical conditions of the gas and/or the mechanism responsible for stimulating the emission",
    ". we will address this problem in both ",
    "[ ratio ] and  [ emr ] .",

    "in addition to these two processes , the response of h@xmath3 gas irradiated by x - rays has been studied by several groups who conclude x - rays are capable of stimulating h@xmath3 emission in a variety of astrophysical environments , including circumstellar disks @xcite . due to the collisional nature of the x - ray ionization process for stimulating h@xmath3 emission ,",
    "this mechanism also has been predicted to populate the excited rovibrational states of the h@xmath3 molecules such that the @xmath48 ratio also has a value of @xmath2  0.1 .",
    "therefore , given the apparent degeneracy of the line ratio , differentiating between these three mechanisms will also require the knowledge of the density and kinematics of the emitting gas .",
    "@xcite present a detailed disk model that incorporates irradiation of the disk by x - rays and uv photons associated with the central source and includes dust grain growth and setting towards the midplane . using this disk model , @xcite calculate the level populations of h@xmath3 in the model disk for a range of dust grain sizes and predict values for the @xmath48 h@xmath3 line ratio for three stimulation scenarios : a ) x - ray and uv , b ) only uv , and c ) only x - ray .",
    "the values @xcite calculate for the line ratios differ significantly from the nominal values mentioned above and depend on sizes of the dust grains ( see figure  17 of @xcite ) .",
    "they also find that as the dust grains grow and the grain opacity decreases , uv pumping should become the dominant stimulation mechanism over x - ray ionization . according to the findings of @xcite , an accurate measurement of the line ratio will determine the mechanism responsible for stimulating the h@xmath3 emission as well as indicate the evolutionary status of the dust grain population .",

    "unfortunately , with upper limits for the ratio of 0.4 and 0.5 for cs  cha and hd  97048 , respectively , these observations lack the sensitivity in both cases to test the predictions of @xcite and do not rule out the ` only uv ' ( scenario b ) case .",
    "simultaneous observations of both lines made with a large aperture telescope and high resolution spectrometer ( r  @xmath19  60,000 ) will be ideal for accurately measuring this line ratio .",
    "the simultaneity of these observations are important if the h@xmath3 emission is variable , as non - simultaneous observations would then likely produce inaccurate measurements of the line ratio .",
    "indeed , the h@xmath3 emission is likely to be variable if the x - ray and uv fluxes , both known to be produced by highly variable phenomena in these young systems , are responsible for stimulating the h@xmath3 molecules .      in the infrared ,",
    "the shapes of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ctts systems are described as ` flat ' due to emission from circumstellar dust grains in excess of the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody curve observed for the stellar photospheres of main sequence stars . however , infrared photometric surveys of many tts in nearby star forming regions , similar to those discussed in  [ intro ] , also identified dips in the 1 - 10  @xmath10 m regions of the otherwise flat seds associated with some of their targets @xcite .",
    "these findings suggest that the small warm dust grains responsible for the short wavelength infrared excesses in most ctts disks are not present within the disks of these systems , while the cooler dust grains responsible for the longer wavelength excess persist in these disks .",
    "therefore , the observed dips in the seds of tts have been interpreted as evidence of holes or clearings in the innermost regions of these disks .",
    "these holes may arise due to the coagulation of small dust grains into planetesimals or the presence of a massive planet that dynamically cleared the inner regions of the disks @xcite .",
    "additionally , disk photoevaporation models , in which disk material is heated and ` boiled ' away by highly energetic x - ray and uv photons , also have been offered as a phenomena responsible for the clearing of the inner holes in these transitional disks @xcite .    for a few such transitional disk sources with inner holes extending out to several tens of aus , such as gm  aur and cs  cha , tiny amounts of small dust grains , @xmath2  0.02 and 5  @xmath15  10@xmath54 lunar masses , respectively , located within @xmath21  au ,",

    "we must consider whether this apparent correlation of h@xmath3 emission with the presence of transitional disks could be the result of observational bias .",
    "specifically , is h@xmath3 emission easier to detect toward transitional disk sources because their near - infrared continuum flux levels are lower and thus do not overwhelm the h@xmath3 line emission ? if all ctts generate some amount of quiescent h@xmath3 emission , but sources with flat spectra and a resulting higher near - infrared continuum flux make detection of these narrow and weak spectral features more difficult , then the brightest @xmath58-band sources should be among the hardest toward which to detect quiescent h@xmath3 emission .",

    "if the gaseous component of the disk were to become more tenuous as the disk evolves , the resultant density structure would allow x - rays and uv photons to penetrate to even greater depths into the disk than suggested by the optical depth surfaces shown in figures  2 - 6 and the critical density contour would move closer to the disk midplane and closer to the star . in this case , which is similar to",

    "the range of h@xmath3 line fluxes ( 6.9@xmath1510@xmath32  @xmath23  f@xmath89  @xmath23  8.6@xmath1510@xmath29  ergs  @xmath44  s@xmath14 ) and masses ( 10@xmath12  @xmath23  m@xmath90  @xmath23  10@xmath91  m@xmath13 ) measured for the chamaeleon  i sources with detected h@xmath3 line emission were found to agree with all previous detections of quiescent h@xmath3 emission .",
    "these trace amounts of gas do not directly inform us about the total disk masses harbored by these systems , though almost certainly the mass of h@xmath3 detected directly through line emission at 2.1218  @xmath10 m represents only a small fraction of the total mass in these disks .",
    "our disk models suggest that the total disk masses could be 10@xmath92 to 10@xmath67 times greater than the mass measured directly in this single emission line .    assuming that shock excitation is not the most likely mechanism for stimulating narrow line emission from h@xmath3 gas which is not doppler shifted from the systemic velocity of the source",
    ", we suggest that uv fluorescence and/or x - rays are the most likely stimulation mechanisms responsible for the observed h@xmath3 emission .",
    "we calculated optical depth surfaces for uv photons and x - rays penetrating a disk composed entirely of h@xmath3 to determine where in a core - accretionally evolved disk these photons deposit their energy and possibly generate h@xmath3 emission .",
    "these models confirm that the radiation is most likely to be absorbed by gas in the upper atmospheres of these disks at intermediate radii and show that these stimulation mechanisms require significantly dense and massive columns of gas to produce the observed emission features at radii coincident with the those determined from the kinematic information .",
    "many improvements may be made to these calculations by including opacities associated with large dust grains , other gaseous species , or a disk model that better approximates an irradiated transitional disk .",
    "however , the results from these calculations suggest that a gas - rich inner disk is necessary to produce quiescent h@xmath3 emission via uv photons and x - rays , and that the stimulated gas resides at high disk altitudes and intermediate disk radii .",
    "all four sources in our survey to - date known to possess transitional disks with optically thin inner disk holes are also h@xmath3 detections .",
    "these detections place gas within the inner disk holes similar to the resolved and unresolved detections of [ ne ii ] emission lines from the sources .",
    "the presence of gas in the inner disk holes confirms the presence of gas within these gaps necessary to explain the accretion activity observed for these sources .",
    "the correlation between sources possessing quiescent h@xmath3 emission and [ ne ii ] suggests a shared stimulation mechanism for both of these lines , a relationship to the photoevaporation process , and a distinct stage in the evolution of these circumstellar disks .",
    "we also find that most sources in our survey with h@xmath4  ews sufficient to classify them as ctts have detectable h@xmath3 emission .",
    "the only exception is ww  cha , which may also be a detection , though we have cautiously classified it as a ` possible ' detection , sine the h@xmath3 emission towards this source , if real , is only at the 2.4@xmath24 level . the apparent relationship between h@xmath4 emission and",
    "accretion activity suggests that the quiescent h@xmath3 emission may likewise be correlated with accretion in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "this is not entirely surprising given that the uv photons necessary for stimulating h@xmath3 emission are likely generated by accretion hot spots on the surfaces of the stars .",
    "in fact , this is strong evidence that uv fluorescence undoubtedly contributes to the observed h@xmath3 emission .",
    "given the dependence of the uv penetration depths on the sizes of the dust grains in the disk , illustrated by @xcite , and the overlap between h@xmath3 detections and sources possessing transitional disks , we suggest that the evolutionary stage of the dust grain population in the inner regions of these disks is also correlated with the production of quiescent h@xmath3 emission . based upon these findings , we propose that sz  33 and doar  21 , both h@xmath3 sources that are borderline c / wtts , likely harbor transitional disks .",

    "<S> the overlap in [ ne  ii ] and h@xmath3 detections hints at a possible correlation between these two features and suggests a shared excitation mechanism of high energy photons . </S>",
