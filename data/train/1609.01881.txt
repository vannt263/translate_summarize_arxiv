    "the discovery of a higgs - like particle at the lhc in 2012 , together with the theory expectation of possible new resonances not predicted by the sm  @xcite , initiated an increasing activity in the study of beyond the sm ( bsm ) physics . in this respect",
    "the electroweak ( ew ) hierarchy problem has become one of the most pressing theoretical issues in high energy particle physics .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed for a bsm dynamics that could solve the hierarchy problem , but no unambiguous experimental evidence is yet available to discriminate among them .",
    "indirect searches can provide some evidence for new phenomena , as in several cases they can be sensitive to scales much higher than the @xmath1 .",
    "an intriguing example are the anomalies in the @xmath0-meson decays recently found at the lhcb experiment  @xcite , which could be suggestive of a violation of universality in the lepton sector .",
    "some extensions of the sm including massive vector bosons @xmath2  @xcite have been proposed to interpret them .    in this work",
    "we try to connect the flavor anomalies with a bsm dynamics motivated by addressing the ew hierarchy problem .",
    "extra - dimensional models _",
    " la _ randran - sundrum ( rs )  @xcite provide a natural way to achieve this aim , as they predict new massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) vector modes that can give rise to new effective interactions among the sm fermions .",
    "these models also allow the possibility that the sm is part of a nearly - conformal sector  @xcite .",
    "this is a very intriguing scenario as well , since it leads to the appearance of a light dilaton that could be either identified with the higgs or provide a new resonance which affects the higgs - sector phenomenology .",
    "we introduce a scenario that is analogous to the usual rs set - up .",
    "we consider an extra - dimensional model in which the extra - dimension is close to ads@xmath3 near the uv brane , the only difference with respect to the rs set - up being a deformation of the background metric near the ir boundary .",
    "the metric in 5 dimensions ( 5d ) is  @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the proper coordinate along the extra - dimension , and the action of the model is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scalar field , @xmath9 are the uv and ir 4 dimensional ( 4d ) brane potentials at @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , and @xmath12 is the 5d planck scale .",
    "the second - order equations of motion of the model can be reduced to first - order form by introducing a superpotential @xmath13  @xcite , given by  @xmath14 ^ 2 - \\frac{1}{3 } w(\\phi)^2 $ ] .",
    "the background equations of motion then reduce to  @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where we use the notation @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the localization of the branes turns out to be governed by the effective potentials  @xmath19 .",
    "the boundary conditions together with the equations of motion lead to @xmath20 . in order to solve the hierarchy problem ,",
    "the brane dynamics should fix @xmath21 to get @xmath22 , as this implies @xmath23 .",
    "we will consider @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is used to fix the length of the extra - dimension . in the following",
    "we assume the dynamics of @xmath8 to be characterized by the analytic superpotential @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are dimensionless parameters controlling the background , and @xmath29 is a mass dimension parameter related to the curvature along the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "in order to introduce the electroweak sector in the theory , we assume a 5d gauge invariance , whose gauge group concides with the sm one @xmath30 . we denote the corresponding gauge fields as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "in addition , we consider a higgs field propagating in the bulk , and we write it as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the higgs background , @xmath39 are physical fluctuations , and @xmath40 are goldstone modes .",
    "the action of the model is then @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the 5d higgs potential .",
    "ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is triggered by an ir brane potential .",
    "the higgs bulk potential contains a mass term @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 controls the localization of the higgs and thus is connected to the amount of tuning related to the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "the gauge fields can be decomposed in kk modes as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 satisfies neumann boundary conditions and bulk equations  @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the mass of the @xmath50-th kk mode and @xmath51 is the mass term induced by the vacuum expectation value of the higgs after ewsb  @xcite .",
    "we plot @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : kkcouplings ] ( left ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the sm fermions are realized as chiral zero modes of 5d fermions .",
    "the localization of the different fermions is determined by the 5d mass terms @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the zero modes are localized near the uv ( ir ) brane for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "a value @xmath56 thus corresponds to a sizable amount of compositeness for the corresponding fermions , whereas @xmath57 characterizes fermions that are almost elementary .",
    "an important ingredient in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhcbanomalies ] is the coupling of the sm fermions with the massive kk modes of the gauge fields , which are universal and fully determined by the localization of the fermions , i.e. by the @xmath58 parameters .",
    "the coupling with the @xmath50-th gauge kk mode , @xmath59 , can be written as  @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are fermion zero - modes , @xmath62 is the sm gauge coupling and @xmath63 these functions are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : kkcouplings ] ( right ) . note that for fields which are almost elementary the coupling becomes rather weak @xmath64 . when comparing the model predictions with ew precision tests ,",
    "the most relevant bounds come from the universal oblique observables , encoded by the @xmath65 variables defined in ref .",
    "these constraints imply a lower bound on the mass of the vector kk modes as well as on the mass of the scalar mode ( the dilaton ) for a fixed potential @xmath66 .",

    "in view of the results of the previous section , a natural question arises : is the @xmath70 higgs resonance found at lhc actually consistent with a dilaton ? in order to answer this , it is not enough to study the mass of the dilaton , but also the couplings of dilaton with sm matter fields . a comparison with the couplings predicted for the higgs in the sm would shed light on this problem .    if we consider a scalar perturbation in the metric @xmath72 , and we decompose the scalar fluctuation as @xmath73 , we can compute the coupling of the dilaton to gauge bosons and fermions  @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the canonically normalized radion field .",
    "the values @xmath76 correspond to the sm higgs couplings . after an expansion of the action of the model to linear order in perturbations , one gets a value of the couplings of order @xmath77 .",
    "the couplings are very small , so that the dilaton can not play the role of a higgs impostor .",
    "its presence , however , only leads to small deviations in sm predictions of the same tiny order  @xcite .",
    "an extension of this model , including higher dimensional operators that could account for  strongly coupled \" dilatons ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) has been studied in  @xcite . however , even in that case , the possibility of a higgs impostor has been disfavored . in conclusion , we find two scenarios : _",
