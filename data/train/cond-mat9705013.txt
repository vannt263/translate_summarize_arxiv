    "with increasing disorder in the system a distribution of hybridization strengths and positions of the local f  states is generated that cause a much broader distribution of kondo temperatures according to the exponential dependence in equation ( [ eq30 ] ) .",

    "quantitatively the magnetoresistivity at low temperatures reaches 800% in the calculation ( with 20@xmath104 cm residual resistivity ) whereas the experimental value is 10% .",
    "the reason for the reduced magnetoresistivity in the experimental data might also be traced back to the same influence of disorder on the coherent scattering part in the resistivity .",

    "@xmath112 the lattice and the impurity thermopower calculated within our model are very similar since coherence no longer plays a role and the impurity concentration explicitly cancels in equation [ thermopower ] . on the other hand",

    "the negative thermopower of cecu@xmath110si@xmath110 , which is still not properly understood , points towards additional lattice effects not included in our model .",
    "besides a possible influence of the band structure non  local quasiparticle interactions , which are not contained in the local approximation , cause significant renomalizations of the one - particle properties ; this is part of the lnca concept @xcite .",

    "is observed ( see e.  g.in @xmath114  @xcite ) .",
    "one possible reason for the negative component of the thermopower is given by intersite spin  interactions .",

    "this might result in a more quantitative agreement between the experimental data and the calculated transport coefficients .",

    "<S> fermion systems were calculated based on a semiphenomenological approach to the lattice non  crossing approximation in the limit of infinite local correlations augmented by crystal  field effects . within the scope of this calculation using the linearized boltzmann theory in the relaxation time approximation the qualitative features of the temperature  dependent resistivity , the magnetoresistivity and the thermoelectric power can be successfully reproduced ; this is exemplified by a comparison with experimental results on @xmath0  . </S>"
