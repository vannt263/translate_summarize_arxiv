    "the problem of determining the distances of planetary nebulae ( pne ) has long been considered a cumbersome issue because of the numerous complexities related to the evolution of these objects .",
    "classical approaches to this problem include trigonometric parallaxes ( harris et al .",
    "1997 ) , the expansion method ( terzian 1997 ) , spectroscopic distances ( mndez et al . 1988 ) , etc .",
    "pne nuclei are far from being considered as `` standard candles '' since they evolve differently according to their masses , a parameter that in most cases is not easily determined . when the central star is not visible , alternative methods based on properties of the nebula itself are required .",
    "these methods are often treated as `` statistical '' , and are based on nebular properties such as the ionized mass ( shklovsky 1956 ) , the evolution of the nebular optical depth with time ( kwok 1985 , marten & schoenberner 1991 ) , the electron density ( barlow 1987 ) , etc .    the first statistical method proposed in the literature , attributed to shklovsky ( 1956 ) ,",
    "is based on the assumption that the nebular ionized mass is an invariant .",
    "although this hypothesis has some limitations ( maciel & pottasch 1980 ) , the method represents a milestone to the distance problem , and was used as a first step to calibrate other similar methods that followed ( daub 1982 , cahn , kaler & stanghellini 1992 ) .",
    "methods based on radio quantities have several advantages over those derived from visual : the interstellar extinction does not play a critical role , even in the cases where the pne are severely affected by interstellar extinction ; radio fluxes are available for a large number of objects , etc .",
    "in addition to that , in the last three decades the increasing number of observations carried out at high spatial resolution , such as the vla ( zijlstra et al . 1989 ) , has largely improved our knowledge of young , compact pne . on the other hand , comparisons among some of these `` radio '' distance scales ( zhang 1995 ; phillips 2002 , 2004 ) reveal that they often exhibit significant biases , showing that the problem is still an open issue .",
    "mid and far - infrared data constitute an interesting alternative to approach the distance problem , because pne are generally strong infrared sources and their emission in this band is little affected by the interstellar extinction .",
    "these two characteristics allow the detection of pne severely obscured by dust , such as pne hidden in the galactic plane , for example .",
    "a relationship between the nebular emission at infrared and radio wavelengths was established by zhang & kwok ( 1993 ) , who studied the correlation between the iras specific intensity at 60 @xmath1 m ( @xmath2 ) and the brightness temperature ( @xmath3 ) at 5 ghz .",
    "these two distance - independent parameters can be correlated with the nebular size to compose a new distance scale .",
    "unfortunately iras fluxes suffer from poor spatial resolution ( @xmath4 ) and the severe crowdness at low galactic latitudes , limitations that were partially overcame by the msx survey ( egan et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) , thanks to its better spatial resolution ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "msx covered the galactic plane between @xmath6 in 4 photometric bands , centred at 8 , 12 , 15 and 21 @xmath1 m .",
    "another milestone infrared survey was isogal ( omont et al .",
    "2003 ) , a part of the iso mission designed to obtain mid - infrared images of the galactic bulge and specific regions of the galactic plane with spatial resolution better than 6  mainly at 7 and 15 @xmath1 m .",
    "although its sensitivity was almost two orders of magnitude deeper than iras and msx , isogal suffered from its small sky coverage , limited to only @xmath7 square degrees",
    ". nevertheless , the total number of detections , including point and extended sources , amounts * to * @xmath8 objects .",
    "more recently , the galactic plane and bulge were surveyed by glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire , fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , a project developed as a part of the `` spitzer '' mission .",
    "glimpse was restricted to @xmath9 and carried out with the infrared camera `` irac '' , which obtained images simultaneously in four mid - infrared bands , centred at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath1 m and with spatial resolution better than 2 .",
    "these surveys contain hundreds of infrared counterparts of pne that can be used as an efficient tool to derive the distance of pne severely affected by interstellar extinction , especially those situated along the galactic plane .",
    ".the msx bands and the coefficients of equation 4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 3 contains the distances calculated for pne present in the sample of ortiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but absent in the list of ssv .",
    "the columns are : ( 1 ) ordering number , according to ortiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; ( 2 ) name ; ( 3 ) msx name ; ( 4 ) angular radius ( ) ;",
    "( 5@xmath108 ) msx flux densities ( jansky ) ; ( 9 - 12 ) distance ( in kpc ) obtained from the flux density at 8 , 12 , 15 and 21 @xmath1 m , respectively ; ( 13 ) average distance ( kpc ) . in order to compare our results with others , we merged tables 2 and 3 and plotted the average distance obtained by the present method against other values given by methods based on radio fluxes , extracted from several references . the distance scale proposed by zhang ( 1995 )",
    "was based on a correlation between @xmath0 and the nebular radius ( an upgrade to the shklovsky method ) , and calibrated with a sample of 134 `` standard '' nebulae .",
    "figure 3 shows that zhang s distance scale is about @xmath11% shorter than ours ( and ssv , by extension ) .",
    "phillips ( 2002 ) proposed a statistical method similar to zhang s ( 1995 ) , but calibrated it with a sample of nearby ( @xmath12 kpc ) pne .",
    "his distance scale was based on a revised relationship between the surface brightness and the nebular radius and , when compared to our results ( fig .",
    "3 , top - right ) , his method produces distances shorter by a factor @xmath13 .",
    "a revision of that method was eventually proposed by phillips ( 2004 ) , that assumes a relationship between the nebular luminosity at 5 ghz and the nebular brightness temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "a comparison between our results and the distances produced by the latter method ( @xmath14 ) is presented in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "3 : there seems to be a bias associated with @xmath15 kpc , but both methods agree within @xmath16% beyond 6 kpc .",
    "the present method was calibrated with nebular flux densities of the msx survey centred at 8.3 , 12.1 , 14.7 and 21.3 @xmath1 m .",
    "this calibration ( equation 4 and table 1 ) can be extended to other surveys if their effective wavelength is similar to msx . as an example",
    ", we present in this section distances of pne detected by the _ spitzer _",
    "satellite during the _ glimpse legacy survey _ ( fazio et al .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the _ irac _ camera had one band centred at @xmath17 m , not very different from the msx band a centred at @xmath18 m . differently from `` point - source surveys '' , glimpse recorded full images of pne and the flux density integrated over the total nebular solid angle can be easily computed and used to produce distances by our method .",
    "kwok et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and zhang & kwok ( 2009 ) obtained integrated flux densities of over 60 pne with sensitivity superior to msx . a comparison between the glimpse and msx fluxes of a sample of 22 pne showed the existence of a bias expressed as : @xmath19 ( zhang & kwok 2009 ) .",
    "we applied this correction factor to glimpse flux densities at 8.0 @xmath20 to calculate @xmath21 and listed these results in table 4 .",
    "the first set of data , from row 1 to 17 , refers to pne situated along the galactic disc , between @xmath22 away from the galactic centre .",
    "the second set , from the 18th row on , refers to pne situated within @xmath23 from the galactic centre , i.e. seen against the bulge .",
    "a simple inspection of these two sets of objects shows that , on average `` disc '' pne have smaller distances when compared to `` bulge '' objects .",
    "actually the distances of the `` disc '' pne show a wide range of values , from 0.6 to 7.2 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the distances of the `` bulge '' pne are more homogeneous , from 3.1 to 9.3 kpc .",
    "the only exception is the object named png358.8 - 00.0 ( terz2022 ) : considering its large infrared flux and apparent size , it is a clear example of a nearby object seen against the bulge .",
    "table 4 also shows how deep is the _",
    "survey when compared to msx : the faintest flux density at 8 @xmath1 m in tables 2 and 3 is @xmath24 jansky ( object m4 - 10 ) , whereas table 4 contains plenty of nebulae with one - tenth of this value .",
    "in this work we proposed a distance scale of planetary nebulae based on mid - infrared flux densities and the nebular apparent size .",
    "a study of two distance - independent nebular parameters  the brightness temperature at 5 ghz and the mid - infrared specific intensity @xmath25  showed that these two characteristics are very well correlated .",
    "this relationship , as well as the similar formulation of the distance scale  @xmath26 as a function of the nebular monochromatic specific intensity and its size  allows us to state that the reliability of our method is similar to ssv s .",
    "in fact , a comparison between the nebular distances calculated by both methods showed that they produce similar results within 50% . nevertheless , since both methods are statistical , each of them might be accurate only within the natural limitation imposed by the set of hypotheses assumed to be valid for the whole set of pne , but that may vary significantly from object to object .",
    "these variations include the different effect of the various spectral features ( continuum , atomic lines , molecular bands ) on the final flux , deviations from sphericity , etc",
    ". however , like in many statistical methods , particular deviations from the average may not introduce significant errors in the distance scale , but only in the error bars .",
    "as an example , according to ssv , excluding bipolar pne from the sample would not change their distance scale by more than 5% , and a similar figure is expected here . on",
    "the other hand , variations of this kind may affect the distance error bars , and a comparison between the distances determined by ssv and our results showed that are equal within @xmath2750% .",
    "although the effects of the [ c / o ] ratio  either of the gas or on the grain surface  on the nebular spectrum are well known , we could not detect its effect on the distance scale proposed , because of the small number of objects in our sample with observed c and/or o molecular features .",
    "as an example of application of the present method , we derived distances of a sample of pne observed by the _ spitzer _ infrared telescope .",
    "this distance scale can be extended to any other database containing nebular radii and flux densities near 8 , 12 , 15 , and 21 @xmath1 m , such as iras , isogal , and future infrared surveys of this kind .",
