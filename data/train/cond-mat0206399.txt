    "<S> an additional electron has to overcome the repulsion from other electrons in the device before entering it . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to lack of inelastic collisions , the thermal distribution in the device is no longer a equilibrium one when electrodes are biased with finite voltages . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a theory containing the above three `` ingredients''phase coherence , coulomb interaction , and nonequilibrium  is of particular interest in the mesoscopic transport .    </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , there seems no standard method to derive them , although various approximation schemes were used for special problem in specific system , e.g. , large - n expansion @xcite , truncation for equation of motion @xcite , introducing an interpolative self - energy @xcite , ng s ansatz for lesser self - energy @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , too much physics is hidden in the general hamiltonian , and it is hopeless to invent a theory covering everything . if we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling case , the complex kondo physics will be ruled out . in these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the green functions in the `` atomic limit '' should be a good starting point for the construction of the full green functions , and we shall show that a general solution to the problem is possible . </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar idea has been addressed in the linear response theory by several authors @xcite , but hardly investigated in the nonlinear regime @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to present a scheme for the calculation of the green functions , and hence establish a theory of nonequilibrium coherent transport through an interacting mesoscopic region . as a price </S>",
    "<S> , the coupling between the central mesoscopic region and the electrodes is required to be relatively small . </S>",

    "<S> thus , our theory reproduces the correct results for the occupation number @xmath99 and the retarded green function @xmath100 in the limit of @xmath101 @xcite , and derive the correlator @xmath102 which is otherwise difficult to obtain . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the equilibrium and nonequilibrium distributions for the quantum dot containing two interacting levels connected with two electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> one can see in the plot : ( a ) the complete coulomb blockade in equilibrium is partially removed in nonequilibrium , i.e. , the blockaded state can be occupied in some `` windows '' of the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the correlator @xmath103 is obviously unequal to @xmath104 in nonequilibrium , although approximately correct in equilibrium for nondegenerate levels . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the total occupation number has fractional steps in nonequilibrium in contrast to integer steps in equilibrium , and the fluctuation of the total number is reminiscent of the shape of tunneling current .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we insert the qd to one arm of a aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the other arm ( reference arm ) is modelled by a quantum point contact , which can be described by adding the term @xmath105 to @xmath106 @xcite , with @xmath107 being the ab phase induced by magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> both the current formula and the equation of @xmath41 should be modified to include the `` direct '' coupling between electrodes , the details will be presented elsewhere . </S>",

    "<S> fig.2 shows the curves of @xmath111 in both linear and nonlinear transport regimes . </S>",
    "<S> three features are noteworthy : ( a ) in linear transport , the conductance is contributed only by the ground state , while in nonlinear transport , the conductance is contributed by both ground and excited states , recognized by the substeps in the conductance plateaus and valleys , which is in agreement with the recent experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) with the increase of the background conductance , @xmath111 vs @xmath112 curves exhibit fano pattern , evolving from a peak ( plateau ) to a pair of peak and dip ( plateau and valley ) , and finally to a dip ( valley ) , which is originated from the constructive and destructive interference between a resonance and the uniform background . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the phase analysis shows that the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath107 across a resonance is quite different between linear and nonlinear transport . in linear transport </S>",
    "<S> , the dependence changes from @xmath113 to @xmath114 abruptly across a resonance , and @xmath115 component only appears on the resonance . in nonlinear transport , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath115 component is always accompanied with the @xmath113 component , and the crossover from @xmath113 to @xmath116 occurs continuously . </S>",
    "<S> the `` nonequilibrium - fano '' effect discussed here and the `` kondo - fano '' effect in @xcite seem to share some similarities , although the mechanisms are basically different .    </S>",

    "<S> the coupled double quantum dots can be modelled by a 4-site hamiltonian @xmath117 we first diagonalize @xmath60 in the 2@xmath118 particle occupation bases . </S>",
    "<S> due to the particle number conservation and spin conservation , the 16 dimensional spaces can be divided into several subspaces @xmath119 , in which eigenstates are readily solved . in principle , one can find out 2@xmath118 conservables written in @xmath120 and @xmath121 as done in ( 1 ) , although it is uneasy and unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> we only need to calculate the effective coupling strength @xmath122 and put them into eq.(8 ) . with @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> solved from the 2@xmath118 linear equations , @xmath123 , hence @xmath28 and @xmath124 are available . finally , the current formula in the n - qd = qd - n system can be simplified as @xmath125 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] we present the numerical results of the tunneling current @xmath126 vs the resonant levels @xmath127 in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the bias voltage @xmath128 ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) is fixed as @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 for the graphs from top to bottom . </S>",
    "<S> the graph of @xmath134 is corresponding to the linear response regime , in which the thermal distribution in the central region is nearly equilibrium . due to the intradot and interdot coulomb interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the conductance peaks are arranged to a hexagon pattern , consistent with both experiment and the semiclassical coulomb blockade model . </S>",
    "<S> the graph of @xmath135 is corresponding to the strong nonequilibrium case , in which thermal distribution of the central region is determined by two reservoirs with different chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of finite bias voltage on the tunneling current is two folded : ( a ) pull each conductance peak along the direction of @xmath136 , and ultimately emerge them into a ridge . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to understand the pulling effect by thinking of the noninteracting case ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) , where the conductance through n - qd = qd - n is allowed only when @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) modify the hexagon pattern significantly , and break the symmetry with respect to @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to the nonequilibrium occupation of the coupled quantum dots . to proceed , </S>",
    "<S> let us cut off the interdot hopping for a moment ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the electron filling to the left ( right ) dot is only related to the chemical potential of the left ( right ) electrode . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation configuration @xmath140 vs the energy levels @xmath127 has the same shape of hexagon boundary as in the equilibrium case , except for a displacement of @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the symmetry with respect to @xmath136 is broken when @xmath142 . turning on the interdot hopping </S>",
    "<S> will make the problem much more complicated , either @xmath143 or @xmath144 are not good quantum number , energy levels of each dot are hybridized into `` molecular orbits '' , and the occupation of the `` molecule '' is affected by both of the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> simple interpretation for this situation is beyond our intelligence .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a theory dealing with nonequilibrium coherent transport through an arbitrary mesoscopic region , possibly containing strong coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the only restriction of the theory is that the coupling between the central region and electrodes should be sufficient weak so that the central region may be regarded as a single quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> the key innovation of the theory is eq.(8 ) which determines the nonequilibrium distribution in an interacting system . </S>",
    "<S> the general theory is applied to two special cases , a single quantum dot with multiple interacting levels and coupled double quantum dots , and novel behaviors are found in the nonlinear coherent transport .    </S>",
