    "the ternary nitrides or carbides with the general formula axm@xmath0 ( a : divalent or trivalent element ; x : carbon or nitrogen ; and m : transition metal ) are already known for several decades  @xcite .",
    "these compounds crystalize in a cubic anti - perovskite structure ( a : cube - corner position ; x : body - center position ; m : face - center position ) and exhibit a wide range of interesting physical properties  @xcite , such as giant magneto - resistance  @xcite and nearly zero temperature coefficient resistivity  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the non - ferromagnetic ground state of mgcni@xmath0 is ascribed to a reduced stoner factor that results from a strong hybridization between the ni-3@xmath2 and c-2@xmath3 electrons . for other ni - based ternary carbides acni@xmath0 ( e.g. , a = al ,",
    "ca , in , zn , and cd ) , the first - principles calculations  @xcite also show that the ground states of these compounds are non - magnetic and the c - ni bonding exhibits nearly same characteristics as the one in mgcni@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , this indicates that the change of composition a could not induce the ferromagnetism in acni@xmath0 . on the other side",
    ", it raises a question whether the change of composition x or m can lead to the appearance of ferromagnetism in axm@xmath0 or not .",
    "very recently , the antiperovskite - type compounds inn@xmath4co@xmath0 and inn@xmath4ni@xmath0 ( @xmath5 1.0 and 0.8 , respectively ) have been synthesized by solid - gas reactions of metal powders with nh@xmath0 and they have been reported to have spin - glass - like properties based on the measurements of temperature dependence magnetization .",
    "@xcite the recent first - principles calculations  @xcite showed that the non - stoichiometry could affect the magnetic properties of acni@xmath0 ( e.g. , alcni@xmath0 and gacni@xmath0 ) and suggested that the tendencies toward magnetism found in experiments  @xcite for these compounds should be explained by the deviation of the ni / c atomic ratio from the ideal stoichiometry . to shed more light on the understanding on the magnetic properties of innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 reported in experiment  @xcite , it is of great importance to theoretically study the electronic structures of these two compounds as well as the nature of the n - co and n - ni bondings .    in order to completely understand the electronic structures and magnetic ground states of innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 with cubic anti - perovskite structure , we carried out the first - principles calculations on these compounds using the pseudopotentials method with plane - wave basis set within the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation .",

    "k * points were carefully checked to ensure that the total energy was converged to be better than 1 mry / cell .",
    "the total energies are obtained as a function of volume and they are fitted with the birch - murnaghan 3rd - order equation of states ( eos )  @xcite to give the equilibrium lattice constant and other ground state properties . during the calculation of density of states ( dos ) ,",
    "a dense * k*-point mesh of 30@xmath630@xmath630 is used , the total dos is computed by the tetrahedron method  @xcite , and the atomic - projected dos is calculated by the lwdin populations  @xcite .    for a cubic crystal ,",

    ", only the gga results are presented below .",
    "the calculated electronic band structures along the high symmetry directions in the brillouin zone are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "as discussed above , for innco@xmath0 the ferromagnetic state is energetically preferable to the paramagnetic state , and hence it is clearly seen that the spin - splitting occurs in the bands around the @xmath48 .",
    "for innco@xmath0 the profile of majority spin bands looks roughly similar to the one of minority spin bands , however only one band in the majority spin bands crosses the fermi level and the corresponding band with same dispersion in the minority spin bands is unoccupied .",
    "in addition , two bands in the minority spin bands across the fermi level of innco@xmath0 ( see fig .  [ fig:2](a ) ) .",
    "for innni@xmath0 the ferromagnetic state is not energetically preferable to the paramagnetic state , consequently , the majority and minority spin bands are degenerated , that is to say , no spin - splitting occurs in the band structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the whole feature of majority spin bands of innni@xmath0 is very similar to the one of innco@xmath0 . in order to reveal the detailed character of band structure , the total density of states ( dos ) and the angular - momentum - projected dos of each atom in innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for both innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 ,",
    "the four bands from -9 ev to -5 ev come mainly from the n 2__p _ _ states and in 5__s _ _ states , and the five bands roughly from -5 ev to -2.5 ev have significant contribution from 3__d__-@xmath49 states of transition metal atoms ( co / ni ) and the 5__p _ _ state of in atom .",
    "for the bands from -2.5 ev to 0 ev ( i.e. , the fermi level ) , they are dominated by the 3__d _ _ states of transition metal atoms ( co / ni ) and have small contribution from the 2__p _ _ states of n atom . because the number of 3__d _ _ electrons in co is one less than that of ni , two minority spin bands composed of the 3__d__-@xmath49 states around the fermi level are unoccupied in innco@xmath0 , while the counterpart in the innni@xmath0 are occupied .",
    "this also results in different behavior of spin - splitting in innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 . due to the significant spin - plitting around the fermi level in innco@xmath0 , the hybridization between the co 3__d _ _ and n 2__p _ _ states in innco@xmath0 are slightly weaker than the one between ni 3__d _ _ and n 2__p _ _ states in innni@xmath0(see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the contributions of each kind of atoms to the dos at the @xmath48 of innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 are listed in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the total dos at the @xmath48 of innco@xmath0 is about 2.761 states / ev per formula unit ( f.u . ) in the gga calculations , which is larger than that of innni@xmath0 , and its main contribution comes from co 3@xmath2 states which accounts for 87% .",
    "for innni@xmath0 in the gga calculations , the contribution of ni 3__d _ _ states to the the total dos at the @xmath48 ( i.e. , 1.803 states / ev.f.u . ) accounts for 72% .",
    "these indicate the 3__d _ _ states of transition metal atoms in innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 play dominant roles in the total dnesity of states of these compounds .    in order to understand the bonding nature among the ions in innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 , we analyzed the charge density contours of innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 in the(110 ) plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , it is found that a certain amount of charges are accumulated in the intermediate region between n and co atoms in innco@xmath0 , and slightly more charges are accumulated intermediate region between n and ni atoms in innni@xmath0 .",
    "this gives an evidence for the strong hybridization between n and transition metal ( co / ni ) atoms , indicating that the n - co and n - ni bondings exhibit strong covalent characteristics and the latter is slightly stronger than the former .",
    "the similar bonding characteristics for ni - n atoms or ni - c atoms were also found in other ni - based ternary nitrides or carbides axni@xmath0  @xcite . therefore , our results suggest that the magnetic properties of innni@xmath0 reported in experiment  @xcite are very likely due to the non - stoichiometry effect , which was also found in the cases of alcni@xmath0 and gacni@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we performed the first - principles calculations to study the elastic and electronic properties of cubic antiperovskites innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 . based on the voigt , reuss and hill bounds ,",
    "the shear , young s moduli and poisson s ratio have also been estimated for the innco@xmath0 and innni@xmath0 polycrystals .",
    "the theoretically predicted equilibrium lattice parameters are in good agreement with the available experimental data .",

    "the magnetic ground state of innni@xmath0 , which is same to other ni - based ternary nitrides or carbides with a cubic anti - perovskite structure , is a stable paramagnetic ( non - magnetic ) state .",
