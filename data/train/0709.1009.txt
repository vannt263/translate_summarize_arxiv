    "it is important to understand when and where intense star formation occurred during the course of galaxy evolution .",
    "although the star formation history in individual galaxies is interesting , a general trend of star formation in galaxies as a function of time ( or redshift ) also provides important insights on the global star formation history as well as on the metal enrichment history in the universe .",
    "therefore , the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) is one of the important observables for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . in the last decade",
    ", many works have followed the pioneer work of madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which compiled the evolution of sfrd , @xmath20 , as a function of redshift for the first time .",
    "the evolution of @xmath20 is now widely accepted as follows : @xmath20 steeply increases from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , and seems to be constant between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and may decline beyond @xmath24 ( hopkins 2004 and references therein ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ; taniguchi et al . 2005 ; bouwens & illingworth 2006 ) .",
    "recent observations by the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ have confirmed that @xmath20 increases from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( e.g. , schiminovich et al . 2005 ; le floch et al .",
    "however , their observations show that the ir luminosity density evolves as @xmath27 while the uv luminosity density evolves as @xmath28 .",
    "this may imply that extinction by dust and reradiation from dust becomes to play a more important role at higher redshift .",
    "one of the remaining problems in this field is a relation between star - formation activity and large - scale structure formation . to study this issue , wide - field",
    "deep surveys are important .",
    "there are several star formation rate ( sfr ) estimators , e.g. , uv continuum , h@xmath0 emission , [ oii ] emission , far - infrared ( fir ) emission ( kennicutt 1998 ) , and radio continuum ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "each estimator has both advantage and disadvantage to estimate sfr .",
    "uv continuum and nebular emission lines are considered to be direct tracers of hot massive young stars . however , they are often affected by dust obscuration . on the other hand , fir and radio continuum are insensitive to dust obscuration .",
    "fir emission is due to the dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field .",
    "if most of the bolometric luminosity of a galaxy absorbed by dust is radiated from young stars , as in the case of dusty starbursts , the fir luminosity is a good sfr estimator . for early - type galaxies , much of the fir emission",
    "is considered to be related to the old stars and the fir emission is not a good sfr estimator ( sauvage & thuan 1992 ; kennicutt 1998 ) . for star - forming galaxies , there is a tight radio - fir correlation ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "this relation suggests that the radio continuum also provides a good sfr estimator .",
    "the radio continuum is considered to be dominated by synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons which are accelerated in supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( lequeux 1971 ; kennicutt 1983a ; gavazzi , cocito , & vettolani 1986 ) .",
    "we note that the radio continuum emission of some galaxies is dominated by the agn component , although such galaxies are distinguished from star - forming galaxies by using the tight radio - fir correlation ( sopp & alexander 1991 ; condon 1992 ) .",
    "the nearly linear radio - fir correlation also suggests that radio continuum is affected by the efficiency of cosmic - ray confinement , since the degree of dust attenuation becomes larger for more luminous galaxies ( bell 2003 ) .",
    "although sfrs evaluated from different sfr estimators are consistent with each other within a factor of 3 if the appropriate correction is applied for each case ( e.g. , hopkins et al . 2003 ; charlot & longhetti 2001 ; charlot et al .",
    "2002 ) , samples selected with a different method may have different biases .",
    "for example , samples selected by an objective - prism imaging survey are biased toward the system with large equivalent width ( e.g. , gallego et al . 1995 ) , while those selected by uv radiation are biased against heavily dusty galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "2006 ) . to evaluate the true sfrd , it is important to correct the obtained sfr appropriately and to know probable biases for the sample selection .    in this work ,",
    "we use the h@xmath0 luminosity as a sfr estimator .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity is directly connected to the ionizing photon production rate .",
    "there are two approaches to measure h@xmath0 luminosities of galaxies .",
    "one is a spectroscopic survey and the other is a narrow - band imaging survey . although spectroscopic observations tell us details of emission line properties , e.g. , balmer decrement , metallicity , and so on , it is difficult to obtain spectra of a large sample of faint galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "narrow - band imaging observations make it possible to measure an emission - line flux of galaxies over a wide field of view .",
    "another advantage of narrow - band imaging is that aperture corrections dose not need to evaluate the total flux of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "however , there are some shortcomings in this method : e.g. , narrow - band filter can not separate h@xmath0 emission from [ nii]@xmath29  emission and we can not evaluate the obscuration degree for each galaxy .",
    "therefore , we must correct these effects statistically .",
    "since the redshift coverage of emission - line galaxies discovered by the narrow - band imaging method is restricted , the survey volume of emission - line galaxies is small .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to obtain a large sample of h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "if this is the case , brighter ( i.e. , rarer ) h@xmath0 emitters could be missed in such an imaging survey . in order to study the h@xmath0 luminosity function unambiguously , we need a large sample of h@xmath0 emitters covering a wide range of h@xmath0 luminosity . on the other hand",
    ", this restriction allows us to investigate large - scale structures of emission - line galaxies ( mostly , star - forming galaxies ) at a concerned redshift slice .",
    "motivated by this in part , we have carried out a narrow - band imaging survey of the hst cosmos field centered at @xmath0(j2000)@xmath30 and @xmath31(j2000)@xmath32 ; the cosmic evolution survey ( scoville et al .",
    "since this field covers 2 square degree , it is suitable for our purpose .",

    "2000 ; iye et al .",
    "since the suprime - cam consists of ten 2k@xmath334k ccd chips and provides a very wide field of view ( @xmath34 ) , this is suitable for any wide - field optical imaging surveys . in our observations",

    "we use the cfht @xmath43 magnitude for bright galaxies with @xmath67 because such bright galaxies appear to be slightly affected by the saturation effect in @xmath42 obtained with suprime - cam .",
    "we also apply the galactic extinction correction adopting the median value @xmath68 ( capak et al . 2007 ) for all objects .",

    "these two criteria are shown by the solid and dashed lines , respectively , in figure [ ha : iz - nbvsnb ] . as we will describe in the next section , we use the broad - band colors of galaxies to separate h@xmath0 emitters from other emission - line galaxies . to avoid the ambiguity of broad - band colors , we select galaxies detected above @xmath66 in all bands .",

    "then we find that h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath93 can be selected by adopting the following three criteria ; ( 1 ) @xmath104 , ( 2 ) @xmath105 , and ( 3 ) @xmath106 .",

    "these criteria give us a sample of 981 @xmath99  emitting galaxy candidates .",
    "the properties of goods - n galaxies presented in figs .",
    "2 and 3 suggest that there is few contamination in our h@xmath0 emitter sample .",
    "as we mentioned in section 1 , one of the advantages of narrow - band imaging is to measure the total flux of h@xmath0 emission directly without any aperture correction . to derive the total h@xmath0 flux ,",
    "we have used the total flux of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) , @xmath48 , and @xmath107 using public images .",
    "our procedure is the same as that given in capak et al .",

    "the flux of h@xmath0 emission line is also affected by the internal extinction .",

    "1995 ) , the fraction of agn contribution to the total h@xmath0 luminosity density is about 15 % in the local universe . if we assume that the 15 % of the h@xmath0 luminosity density is radiated from agns , the corrected sfrd is @xmath15 @xmath163 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "we note here that the error to @xmath20 ( and @xmath164 ) is probably underestimated , since it does not include the effect of different correction methods and selection biases .",
    "for example , adopting the different relation for correcting @xmath119 may cause a different value of sfrd .",
    "we compare our result with the previous investigations compiled by hopkins ( 2004 ) in figure [ ha : madauplot ] .",
    "we also show the evolution of sfrd derived from the observation of galex with mean attenuation of @xmath165 , evaluated from the fuv slope @xmath96 ( @xmath166 ) and the relation of @xmath167 . if we adopt the more representative value @xmath168 ( schiminovich et al . 2005 ) determined by using the @xmath169 ratio ( buat et al .",
    "2005 ) , their sfrd becomes smaller by a factor of 2 , being similar to our sfrd .",
    "the left panel of figure [ ha : madauplot ] shows the evolution of the sfrd as a function of redshift from @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ ha : madauplot ] shows that as a function of the look - back time .",
    "it clearly shows that sfrd monotonically decreasing for 10 gyr with increasing cosmic time .",
    "we note that the error of sfrd of our evaluation includes only random error , since we adopt the same assumptions as those in hopkins ( 2004 ) .",
    "our sfrd evaluated above seems roughly consistent with but slightly smaller than the previous evaluations , e.g. , tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) and fujita et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , we consider that the difference between our survey and theirs is not caused by the different criteria of @xmath173})_{\\rm obs}$ ] . as we mentioned in section 4.1 , the sfrd of fujita et al .",
    "( 2003 ) was overestimated because of the contamination of [ oiii ] emitters . on the other hand",
    ", the difference between tresse & maddox ( 19989 and our work seems to be real ; e.g. , the cosmic variance .",
    "we discuss further the effect of the selection criterion of @xmath138})_{\\rm obs } > 12 $ ]    on the evaluation of sfrd .",
    "being different from the previous h@xmath0 emission - line galaxy surveys using the objective - prism , the fraction of galaxies having @xmath174   is 12 % in our sample , which is similar to or less than the value of the local universe ( 15 - 20 % : heckman 1998 ) and singg sr1 ( 14.5 % : hanish et al .",
    "on the other hand , the fractions of the galaxies with @xmath174    are 42 % and 35 % in the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) ( gronwall et al .",
    "2004 ) and ucm objective - prism surveys , respectively .",
    "our sample seems to be not strongly biased toward galaxies with high equivalent width .",
    "hanish et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that 4.5 % of the h@xmath0 luminosity density comes from galaxies with @xmath175   in local universe .",
    "if the fraction ( 4.5 % ) is valid for the star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 , our estimate of sfrd would be about 5 % smaller than the true sfrd .",
    "figure [ ha : radec ] shows the spatial distribution of our 980 h@xmath0 emitter candidates .",
    "there are some clustering regions over the field . to discuss the clustering properties more quantitatively",
    ", we derive the angular two - point correlation function ( acf ) , @xmath176 , using the estimator defined by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) , @xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 are normalized numbers of galaxy - galaxy , galaxy - random , random - random pairs , respectively .",
    "the random sample consists of 100,000 sources with the same geometrical constraints as the galaxy sample .",
    "figure [ ha : lf ] demonstrates that our h@xmath0 emitter sample is quite incomplete for @xmath181 .",
    "we therefore show the acf for 693 h@xmath0 emitter candidates with @xmath182 in figure [ ha : acf ] .",
    "the acf is fit well by power law , @xmath18 .",
    "recently , the departure from a power - law of the correlation function is reported ( zehavi et al . 2004 ; ouchi et al .",
    "such departure may be interpreted as the transition from a large - scale regime , where the pair of galaxies reside in separate halos , to a small - scale regime , where the pair of galaxies reside within the same halo .",
    "we find no evidence for such departure in our result .",
    "we however consider that the number of our sample is too small to discuss this problem .",
    "for lyman break galaxies , brighter galaxies ( with a larger star formation rate ) tend to show more clustered structures than faint ones ( with a smaller star formation rate ) ( e.g. , ouchi et al .",
    "2004 ; kashikawa et al .",
    "we also show the acf of h@xmath0 emitters with larger h@xmath0 luminosity [ @xmath183 and that with lower h@xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath184 ) in figure [ ha : acf ] .",
    "both acfs are well fit with a power law form : @xmath185 for objects with @xmath186 , while @xmath187 for objects with @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that galaxies with a higher star formation rate are more strongly clustered than ones with a lower star formation rate .",
    "this fact is interpreted as that galaxies with a higher star formation rate reside in more massive dark matter halos , which are more clustered in the hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "it is useful to evaluate the correlation length @xmath189 of the two - point correlation function @xmath190 .",
    "a correlation length is derived from the acf through limber s equation ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "assuming that the redshift distribution of h@xmath0 emitters is a top hat shape of @xmath191 , we obtain the correlation length of @xmath192 mpc .",
    "therefore , the two - point correlation function for all h@xmath0 emitters is written as @xmath193 .",
    "the correlation length of h@xmath0 emitters with @xmath194 is 2.9 mpc , while that of h@xmath0 emitters with @xmath195 is 1.6 mpc .",
    "these values are smaller than those evaluated for nearby @xmath196 galaxies ( @xmath197 mpc ) ( norberg et al .",
    "2001 ; zehavi et al . 2005 ) and @xmath26 galaxies ( @xmath198  5 mpc)(coil et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is known that the correlation length is smaller for fainter galaxies in the nearby ( norberg et al .",
    "2001 ; zehavi et al . 2005 ) and the @xmath26 universe ( coil et al . 2006 ) .",
    "figure [ ha : lhamr ] shows the relation between the @xmath199 and @xmath200-band absolute magnitude @xmath120 for our sample .",
    "our sample includes many faint ( @xmath201 ) galaxies .",
    "however , the correlation length for galaxies with @xmath202 ( 3.8 mpc : zehavi et al .",
    "2005 ) is still larger than that of our sample .",
    "this discrepancy may imply a weak clustering of emission - line galaxies .",
    "we have performed the h@xmath0 emitter survey in the hst cosmos 2 square degree field using the cosmos official photometric catalog .",
    "our results and conclusions are summarized as follows .",
    "we found 980 h@xmath0 emission - line galaxy candidates using the narrow - band imaging method .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity function is well fit by schechter function with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . using the parameter set of schechter function ,",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity density is evaluated as @xmath203 .",
    "if we adopt the agn contribution to the h@xmath0 luminosity density is 15 % , we obtain the star formation rate density of @xmath204 .",
    "this error includes only random error .",
    "our result supports the strong increase in the sfrd from @xmath170 to @xmath205 .",
    "we studied the clustering properties of h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath155 .",
    "the two - point correlation function is well fit by power law , @xmath206 , which leads to the correlation function of @xmath207 .",
    "we can not find the departure from a power law , which is recently found in both low- and high-@xmath153 galaxies .",
    "although the power of @xmath208 is consistent with the power for nearby galaxies , the derived correlation length of @xmath192 mpc is smaller than that for nearby galaxies with the same optical luminosity range .",
    "this discrepancy may imply a weak clustering of emission - line galaxies .",
    "the galaxies with higher sfr are more strongly clustered than those with lower sfr .",
    "taking account of the fact that the sfr of a luminous galaxy is higher than that of a faint galaxy , this result is consistent with the fact already known that the luminous galaxies are more strongly clustering .",
