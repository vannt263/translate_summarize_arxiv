    "the spectral energy distribution of quasars in uv - optical range is characterised by the so called big blue bump with a pick around @xmath3 , broad emission lines of hydrogen lyman and balmer series and low - ionized metals ( e.g. civ , siiii , mgii etc . ) , broad absorption lines ( only in @xmath4% of quasars ) and decrement of the flux blueward of 1215  due to absorption by intergalactic hi ( the ly@xmath5 forest ) .",
    "it is believed that the ( mostly thermal ) continuum and emission lines originate from the hot accretion disk and circumnuclear fast moving clumps of gas , correspondingly .",
    "the proximity of these regions is considered to be the most promising explanation of the baldwin effect @xcite : the inverse correlation of equivalent width of some emission lines with the monochromatic fluxes at uv region ( in most cases the flux at @xmath6  or @xmath7  is considered in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) .    due to remarkable similarity of the quasar spectra from object to object , the mean , or composite , spectra",
    "are usually used to study the general spectral properties of quasars .",
    "they are also widely used as templates for redshift determination ( mainly in automatic redshift surveys ) .",
    "the averaging over several hundreds or even thousands of ( usually ) medium - resolution spectra allows to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and to reveal tiny features unseen in individual spectra .",
    "the composite spectra of quasars in ultraviolet - optical band were compiled for a wide set of quasar samples @xcite .",
    "they also used in ly@xmath5-forest studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main sources of uncertainties during the generation of the quasar composite spectra is the difference in spectral shape of individual objects ( despite of the general similarity ) , e.g. the difference in spectral index @xmath1 of the red part of uv- optical bump .",
    "thus in the present work to study the part of the uv - optical bump we used the composite spectra compiled by us from samples of spectra with similar @xmath1 .",
    "for our study we used 16 composite spectra of quasars compiled by us @xcite .",
    "each of these spectra was generated of 200 individual ones with similar spectral indices @xmath1 within the range @xmath2 namely from those that have the values of @xmath1 close to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the composite number .",
    "these subsamples were taken from the publicly available release of the sky - residual subtracted spectra @xcite for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) legacy release 7 @xcite .",
    "the spectral indices for individual spectra were calculated considering the continuum of the quasar spectra redward of the ly@xmath5 emission line ( 1215 ) to be a power - law @xmath10 , and using the following wavelength ranges , which are the most free from emission lines : 1278@xmath111286 , 1320@xmath111326 , 1345@xmath111360 and 1440@xmath111480 .",
    "the mean arithmetic spectra were obtained after ( i ) division of each individual spectrum on its normalization constant ( the mean flux over all pixels within the rest wavelength range 14501470 ) , ( ii ) rebinning them with @xmath12 , and ( iii ) stacking the spectra into the rest frame .",
    "the dispersion @xmath13 of each pixel of the composite spectrum is calculated from the noises @xmath14 of pixels of individual spectra as @xmath15 .",
    "the spectral indices of the composite spectra were calculated in the way mentioned above , but the parts of the spectra which are the most free from emission lines were selected manually in each composite .",
    "the parts of spectra used for calculating the spectral index are shown in figure  [ fig : lena ] ( _ short - dashed _ line , the highest spectra are the steepest ones ) .",
    "three spectra with the slopes @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are shown with the _ solid _ lines together with the fitted power - law continua ( _ dashed _ lines ) .",
    "the regions used for continuum fitting slightly vary from spectrum to spectrum which is probably caused by changing of intensity of weak emission lines .",
    "it is worth to note that there is no absolutely emission line - free region in uv - optical bump , and selection of lines - free regions means selection of regions with the weakest emission lines ."
