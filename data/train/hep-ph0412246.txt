    "a considerable effort @xcite has recently been devoted to the reproduction of soft data at @xmath1 through analytical fits based on @xmath2-matrix theory . three main forms for the pomeron , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and simple poles @xmath5 , work reasonably well in the description of total cross sections at high energy ( @xmath6  gev )",
    ", however the simple - pole description fails if the energy threshold is lowered to @xmath7  gev , or if the real part of the amplitude is included , whereas the logarithmic forms achieve a good fit quality down to 5  gev .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "if a `` new '' singularity with higher intercept @xmath8 ( unitarized at @xmath9  gev ) is added to the soft simple - pole - pomeron contribution , all three forms describe the data almost equivalently . on the other hand , the dispersion relations , with low - energy corrections for the real part of amplitudes , lead also to improved and comparable descriptions of the data at @xmath1 within these three pomeron models @xcite .",
    "thus , one can not conclude which kind of pomeron best agrees with experiment on the sole basis of the available data on the total cross - sections , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    however , it is a very important task to cut down the list of pomeron models as this is needed to give unambiguous predictions for high energies .",
    "we believe that , in order to make progress in this direction , we have to extend the dataset , considering also the data for non - forward elastic hadron scattering .",
    "for total cross sections and real parts of amplitudes at @xmath1 , we have now a standard and commonly accepted set of experimental points @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a standard dataset for differential cross sections at @xmath12 is not established yet .",
    "however , the existing data are gathered in their original form , for example in the durham database @xcite .",
    "we have collected , checked , and uniquely formatted about 10000 experimental points on differential cross sections for @xmath13 elastic scattering in the energy region @xmath14  gev and at all measured transferred momenta .",
    "the quality of the data obtained in various experiments varies quite strongly . for many sets ,",
    "systematic errors are not given and for some others it is not clear from the original papers whether the systematic errors are included or not to the errors given in tables .",
    "besides , it is well known that the normalisations of different sets are not in agreement , and are even sometimes in direct contradiction .    taking into account these circumstances ,",
    "we have excluded a few subsets ( 11 ) out of a total of 200 .",
    "these 11 subsets contradict even by eye the majority of the other subsets .",
    "we do not give here the detailed description of the data and individual references for the sets : this will be done in our forthcoming full paper @xcite .",
    "a general goal of the analysis of the non - forward elastic - scattering data is to compare various pomeron models on the basis of a standard dataset , which should be as complete as possible . to simplify the analysis at the first stage , we restrict ourselves to the small-@xmath15 region , where the differential cross sections have a smooth behaviour ( dominated by single pomeron and reggeon exchange terms ) .",
    "we analyse the data for elastic @xmath16 and @xmath17 differential cross sections in the intervals @xmath18 @xmath19 ( there are some inconsistencies of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 data at @xmath22 , hence the exclusion of this region ) .",
    "to analyse the data , we considered a simplified parametrisation for the amplitudes , and then used it in the so - called method of overlapping bins .",
    "* amplitudes : * they were written in the form @xmath23 where the pomeron term @xmath24 , the crossing - even term @xmath25 and the crossing - odd term @xmath26 are @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 with @xmath30  gev@xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the scattering angle in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "we consider the crossing - even and crossing - odd reggeons as effectively describing exchange - degenerate @xmath34 and @xmath35 contributions .",
    "the couplings @xmath36 and trajectories @xmath37 are the constants determined from the fit in each @xmath0-bin .",
    "* overlapping bins : * let us define the elementary bin : @xmath38 .",
    "if the @xmath39-dependence of the above amplitudes is roughly correct , we can determine the values of the trajectories and couplings in a given bin , provided @xmath40 is small enough .",
    "performing such fit for @xmath41 , we scan all data from @xmath42 up to @xmath43 and extract an effective @xmath0-dependence of trajectories and form factors or couplings .",
    "a few remarks regarding the method are to be noted :    1",
    ".   the length of the bin should be not too big because of the simplified parametrisation and not too small in order to contain a reasonable number of points for each process .",
    "we take @xmath44 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath45 as the minimal number of points for each process , thus taking into account only bins with 24 points or more .",
    "we take for the shift from bin to bin @xmath46 .",
    "wide variations of @xmath40 and @xmath47 do not change the conclusions .",
    "the fact that @xmath48 decreases almost exponentially with @xmath15 is important even for small @xmath40 . in each bin",
    ", we have written all couplings in the form @xmath49 .",
    "the constants @xmath36 ( effective couplings at the first point ( @xmath50 ) of the corresponding bin ) are discussed below .",
    "* reggeon ( `` @xmath51 '' and `` @xmath52 '' ) trajectories : * we are faced with the problem of the crossing - even and crossing - odd reggeon terms .",
    "let us to call them as `` @xmath51 '' and `` @xmath52 '' contributions .",
    "they are badly determined from the fit .",
    "the obtained values of trajectories , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as well as @xmath55 , if left free , have a big dispersion from bin to bin .",
    "this is caused mainly by the inconsistencies in normalisation of the many subsets . to restrict this randomness",
    ", we used the intercepts and slopes of @xmath51 and @xmath52 trajectories from the fits at @xmath1 and from the spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "namely , we fixed the @xmath52 trajectory using @xmath56 . for the @xmath51 trajectory we considered two variants , `` maximal '' @xmath57 and `` minimal '' @xmath58 .",
    "the results obtained in the bin - analysis of the differential cross sections are shown in figs [ fig : chi]-[fig : fcoupl ] . the black ( resp .",
    "grey ) symbols in figs .",
    "[ fig : chi ] , [ fig : traj ] correspond to the maximal ( resp .",
    "minimal ) @xmath51 trajectory .",
    "* pomeron trajectory : * one can see from fig .  [",
    "fig : traj ] that data do not confirm the `` standard '' values of the soft pomeron trajectory @xcite .",
    "we indeed obtain @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    .",
    "the long - dashed line corresponds to the parametrisation ( [ ddln ] ) , the short - dashed line to a dipole form ( [ dipol ] ) , and the solid line to the sum of two exponentials ( [ expo]).,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=120]-0.5 cm      * pomeron couplings * fig .",
    "[ fig : pcoupl ] shows that , in the @xmath59 and @xmath66 case , the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath0 is not described perfectly ( @xmath68 ) by the expression @xmath69^{2 } \\label{ddln}\\ ] ] given in @xcite .",
    "they are much better described ( @xmath70 ) by a simple dipole form @xmath71^{2 } \\label{dipol}\\ ] ] or by the sum of two exponentials ( @xmath72 ) @xmath73^{2}. \\label{expo}\\ ] ]    * reggeon couplings : * the effective couplings of @xmath51 and @xmath52 reggeons both have at least one zero .",
    "fig : ocoupl ] - [ fig : fcoupl ] ) . for the @xmath52 contribution",
    ", this is a well - known feature , related to the crossover effect ( differential cross sections of @xmath74 and @xmath75 cross at small @xmath15 ) discovered a long time ago in several experiments .",
    "however the zeros in the @xmath51-reggeon couplings are highly unexpected .    the detailed analysis of the results for the @xmath0-dependence of the effective couplings will be performed in a forthcoming full paper @xcite . here",
    "we give only some properties of the derived couplings in the case of the maximal @xmath51 trajectory .",
    "* crossing - odd couplings : * fig .",
    "[ fig : ocoupl ] shows their extracted values and a fit to a single exponential multiplied by the factor @xmath76 .",
    "this leads to the following values for the zeros ( in gev@xmath31 ) : @xmath77              as a conclusion to this short note , we would like to point out that the interpretation of the zeros in the form factors is not yet clear . our attempts to perform a global fit of the various analytical models to the data failed when double re - scatterings ( even with arbitrary strength ) were included .",
    "only the explicit account of zeros allows to describe well the full set of data in the first cone region , however it leads to low slopes for the @xmath51 and @xmath52 trajectories . a more thorough investigation of the problem is in progress",
