    "in the modern theory of electric polarization in topological insulators @xcite , the concept of a berry phase ( sometimes called a geometric phase ) has played a central role . in this context , the berry phase is the phase acquired by a charged - particle bloch wave state under adiabatic transport of the bloch wave momentum around the brillouin zone .",
    "this provides an understanding of the topological origin of charge transport in such systems , in which the bulk material is an insulator with a mass gap , but current is carried by special `` topologically protected '' edge states . in this paper , i will show that the berry phase concept provides a natural framework for discussing the role of the topological @xmath1 parameter in relativistic gauge theories such as qcd . in this formulation ,",
    "the @xmath1 parameter itself is a berry phase , and the bloch wave states that define it are constructed from the dirac zero modes associated with topological fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "first we will discuss the interpretation of the @xmath1 parameter in two - dimensional u(1 ) gauge theories ( e.g. qed2 or @xmath3 sigma models ) , where a @xmath1 term in the lagrangian can be interpreted as a background electric field @xcite . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1 dependence of the vacuum energy and nonzero topological susceptibility are determined by the polarizability of quark - antiquark pairs in the vacuum . for small values of the background electric field , these pairs do not come apart completely , but form localized dipoles which partially screen the background field .",
    "but when the electric field exceeds a certain strength ( corresponding to @xmath4 or a half - unit of electric flux ) , it becomes energetically favorable for a pair to come apart , with charge ending up at @xmath5 spatial infinity ( or on the capacitor plates that were erected to provide the background field ) .",
    "this screens off exactly one unit of electric flux , leaving a net flux of a half - unit in the other direction .",
    "when the value of @xmath1 reaches @xmath6 , the bulk vacuum is back to having zero electric field . in the bulk ,",
    "the @xmath7 vacuum and the @xmath8 vacuum are indistinguishable . to distinguish between them",
    ", we must include the boundary charges on the capacitor plates .",
    "this is quite analogous to the bulk - boundary constraint in topological insulators : the difference between the value of the bulk topological parameter @xmath1 before and after a transition is determined by the amount of charge that has flowed from the bulk to the boundary .",
    "current is only conserved if we include boundary charges . in the context of relativistic gauge theories ,",
    "the relation between bulk and boundary currents can be formulated covariantly as an `` anomaly inflow '' constraint @xcite .",
    "the evidence for codimension - one chern - simons membranes as the dominant topological charge excitations in the qcd vacuum has been discussed previously @xcite . for 4-dimensional qcd ,",
    "the operator which inserts such a membrane into the vacuum is the exponential of a 3d integral of the 3-index chern - simons tensor @xmath9 over the surface of the membrane .",
    "the topological charge density @xmath10 is obtained from the exterior derivative of this tensor , or equivalently , the divergence of the chern - simons current . for the case of 2d u(1 )",
    "gauge theory , the topological charge density @xmath11 is proportional to the field strength , @xmath12 so the chern - simons current @xmath13 is just the dual of the gauge potential @xmath14 . for this case",
    "the integral over the membrane reduces to an ordinary wilson line integral .",
    "this allows us , in the 2d case , to interpret a chern - simons membrane as the space - time path of a point - like charged particle .",
    "thus for example , in the 2d @xmath15 sigma model , the view of the vacuum as a condensate of tightly bound charged pairs , as suggested by both the large - n solution @xcite and the lattice strong - coupling expansion @xcite , is supported by the observed dominance of 1d coherent topological charge membranes in monte carlo configurations @xcite , which are interpreted as the space - time paths of charged particle pairs in the condensate .",
    "the analogous structure of layered , codimension - one topological charge membranes observed in 4-dimensional @xmath16 lattice gauge configurations @xcite suggests a natural extension of these ideas to the actual theory of interest , 4-dimensional qcd .    in the 2d u(1 ) theories , the polarizability of charged pairs in the vacuum determines the topological susceptibility as well as the string tension , i.e. the strength of the long - range charge confining linear coulomb potential . in this paper",
    "we will show how to formulate the connection between topology and polarization in 2d u(1 ) gauge theory in terms of a berry connection which relates the local value of @xmath1 to the polarization of vacuum pairs . in this respect",
    "it is quite similar to the treatment of polarization in topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the discussion of a berry connection in relativistic gauge theory is facilitated by considering the `` fermionic '' description of a gauge field configuration . in this approach",
    ", one characterizes any particular gauge configuration in terms of the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the associated dirac operator .",
    "the fermionic description of gauge configurations is particularly useful for considering the structure of topological charge fluctuations in the gauge field .",
    "the connection between topological gauge field fluctuations and the spectrum of the dirac operator is embodied in the the atiyah - singer index theorem , which relates the number of units of topological charge of the gauge field on a periodic euclidean 2- or 4-torus to the net number ( left minus right ) of chiral zero eigenmodes of the associated dirac operator .",
    "the connection between topological charge and dirac zero modes is most directly formulated in euclidean spacetime , but it is instructive to consider this connection in a hamiltonian framework , in which it may be described in terms of spectral flow . in this description , rather than considering eigenmodes of the euclidean dirac operator , we choose a time direction and consider the eigenmodes of the dirac hamiltonian as a function of time .",
    "the number of units of topological charge on the torus is related by the index theorem to the net number of left and right - handed chiral hamiltonian eigenmodes which flow from positive to negative energy as we go once around the torus in the time direction .",
    "as i will discuss in this paper , the hamiltonian spectral flow description of topological charge fluctuations can be recast in terms of a berry phase .",
    "the evolution of the hamiltonian eigenstates in time , which defines the spectral flow , is reinterpreted as an adiabatic evolution in a bloch wave momentum variable that characterizes the dirac hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "the berry phase thus defined is a measure of the polarization of vacuum pairs , and it defines a local value of @xmath1 . in the weak field",
    "perturbative limit there is no dissociation of pairs , as depicted in fig 1(a ) .",
    "this calculation reproduces the perturbative result for topological susceptibility from one - loop vacuum polarization @xcite . for stronger fields ,",
    "a transition between discrete vacua with @xmath1 differing by @xmath17 is identified as a discrete shift of the berry phase , representing the instantaneous charge transport caused by dissociation of each vacuum pair , with the members of each pair recombining with the opposite charged member of a neighboring pair .",
    "this is represented in fig .",
    "just as in the theory of electric polarization @xcite , a nonzero berry phase represents the transport of units of charge across a cell of the spatial lattice which defines the brillouin zone band structure of the wavefunctions .",
    "the relation between hamiltonian spectral flow and the berry phase description of topological charge is most easily seen in 2d u(1 ) theory for the case of a constant field strength on a periodic 2-torus .",
    "choosing @xmath18 gauge , the gauge interaction term in the dirac hamiltonian is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the field strength and @xmath21 is euclidean time . for a massless dirac fermion in 2d euclidean space",
    ", the dirac eigenvalue equation separates into equations for left and right handed components : @xmath22 where @xmath23 let s first consider the equation for the left component .",
    "we choose coordinates in the x - direction such that the period in that direction is @xmath6 , and we look for periodic solutions , @xmath24 for field strength @xmath25 the topological charge density is @xmath26 . for constant @xmath25",
    "we have one unit of topological charge on the torus if we choose the period in the time direction to be @xmath27 .",
    "the dirac wavefunctions are periodic in the spatial direction , but only quasiperiodic ( periodic up to a gauge transformation ) in the time direction , @xmath28 because the integrated topological charge density is an integer , this gauge transformation is also periodic in @xmath29 so it is well - defined and continuous on the torus . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the index theorem implies the existence of a left - handed eigenmode with zero eigenvalue , given explicitly by @xmath31 which satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "if the field strength @xmath25 is negative , there is instead a right - handed zero mode @xmath33 .    in a hamiltonian framework ,",
    "the index theorem manifests itself in the form of a spectral flow constraint .",
    "consider the dirac hamiltonian as a parametric function of a rescaled time @xmath34 , @xmath35 acting on a periodic spatial interval @xmath36 , this hamiltonian is periodic , up to a gauge transformation , over the euclidean time interval @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 thus , for any integer @xmath39 , the spectrum @xmath40 of @xmath41 matches up with @xmath42 , the spectrum of @xmath43 .",
    "the dirac spectral flow for the gauge configuration is given by @xmath39 , the integer shift of the spectrum over the periodic time interval , or , more generally , the net number of left- minus right - handed modes that cross from negative to positive energy . as first pointed out by atiyah and lustig @xcite ,",
    "the spectral flow of the dirac hamiltonian is equal to the integrated topological charge over the 2d euclidean space .",
    "note that , if we quantize the dirac hamiltonian ( as opposed to just employing the dirac operator as a probe of the gauge field ) , spectral flow is associated with the production of fermion - antifermion pairs : a mode which crosses from negative to positive energy changes from filled to empty in the physical vacuum .    in this example , the spectral flow parameter @xmath44 has a simple physical significance .",
    "it is the momentum imparted to the fermion from the background field over the time interval @xmath21 .",
    "this allows us to interpret the time evolution of the spectral flow as an adiabatic transport of the momentum parameter in the fermion wave function , thus providing the essential elements of a berry phase construction .",
    "furthermore , the quasiperiodicity in euclidean time ( [ eq : quasiperiodic ] ) under an integer shift of @xmath39 reflects a brillouin zone structure in momentum space .",
    "this is clarified by rewriting the zero mode wavefunction via a poisson transformation .",
    "the function ( [ eq : zeromode ] ) is a jacobi elliptic theta function and a poisson transformation on the sum corresponds to a conjugate modulus transformation which effectively interchanges the the real and imaginary periods of the elliptic function .",
    "this gives @xmath45 where we denote points of a spatial lattice by @xmath46 .",
    "we also note that the zero mode wave function was constructed in the @xmath18 gauge .",
    "this function is periodic in @xmath47 , but only periodic up to a gauge transformation in the time direction .",
    "but the gauge transformation from the @xmath18 gauge to the @xmath48 gauge is just @xmath49 in the @xmath48 gauge , the wave function is periodic in time and quasiperiodic in space , and has the form of a bloch wave , @xmath50 this suggests interpreting the zero mode wave function @xmath51 on the torus @xmath36 as the periodic part of a bloch wave state on an infinite spatial lattice @xmath52 . in the discussion",
    "thus far , we have regarded @xmath25 as a background electric field in one space and one time dimension .",
    "but the euclidean 2d theory can just as well be interpreted as a 2 space - dimensional system in a transverse magnetic field , as e.g. in the quantum hall effect",
    ". then a single periodic zero mode of the form ( [ eq : zeromode ] ) can be interpreted as a superposition of localized landau orbitals . with a constant background field",
    ", the orbitals at different spatial locations are degenerate and regularly spaced , and can combine into delocalized bloch wave states .",
    "this gives a natural lattice structure , with lattice spacing determined by the radius of a landau orbit and thus by the strength of the field @xmath25 .",
    "charge transport in such a system results from each local orbit handing off a charge to the orbit to its left and picking up a charge from the orbit to its right as depicted in fig .",
    "the transport of charge across a single lattice cell is embodied in the phase of the periodic part of the bloch wave , @xmath53 in ( [ eq : blochwave ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath1 parameter in 2d u(1 ) gauge theory as a local field describing the polarization of pairs in the vacuum can now be stated in terms of a berry connection , following lines similar to the description of electric polarization in topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the berry connection is constructed by differentiating the periodic part of the bloch wave function with respect to the momentum parameter : @xmath54 the terms in the sum over @xmath55 represent individual landau orbits localized around an origin at site @xmath56 .",
    "we see that differentiating by @xmath39 weights each term in the wavefunction by the dipole moment of the charge at @xmath47 _ with respect to the center of its own landau orbit . _",
    "( this can be taken as a charge - neutral dipole with the positive charge at @xmath47 and the negative charge at the origin @xmath57 . ) the berry connection @xmath58 at a particular lattice site is defined as the matrix element of @xmath59 integrated over the cell , @xmath60 this plays the role of a gauge field in momentum space , where the phase change of the dirac wave function under adiabatic translation in @xmath39 space is given by the line integral of @xmath58 .",
    "the berry phase which defines the local polarization field @xmath61 is the gauge invariant closed loop integral around the lowest brillouin zone @xmath62 , @xmath63 here the range of integration @xmath62 is over the brillouin zone ( bz ) associated with the lowest band of bloch wave states , which are constructed from superpositions of left- and right - handed zero modes on a lattice cell . a gauge transformation of the berry connection @xmath58 which is topologically trivial over the bz will leave the value of @xmath61 invariant . on the other hand , a gauge transformation with nonzero winding number @xmath64 around",
    "the bz will change the value by @xmath65 .",
    "these topologically nontrivial gauge transformations around the bz represent the transfer of one or more units of charge between the two boundaries of the domain .",
    "they transform between vacua with values of @xmath1 which differ by integer multiples of @xmath6 .",
    "these vacua are indistinguishable in the bulk ( which is why @xmath1 is a truly periodic variable on a torus with no boundaries ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 vacuum would have one unit of background electric flux , but this is completely screened by the unit of charge that flowed to the boundary , so in the bulk there is zero electric field .",
    "thus the value of @xmath1 keeps track of the current that has flowed to the boundaries .",
    "this is also the origin of the `` bulk - boundary '' constraint which relates the change of the @xmath1 parameter across a membrane to the surface charge density on the membrane .",
    "this has been discussed previously in the context of anomaly inflow @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider in more detail the adiabatic evolution of the bloch wave states as we go around the bz .",
    "we can write the time - dependent dirac equation for the periodic zero mode @xmath66 as a formula for the adiabatic evolution of the bloch wave in @xmath39 space , @xmath67 for large t , this equation traces out the adiabatic evolution of the eigenstates of @xmath41 as a function of @xmath39 . at any particular value of @xmath39 , taking the @xmath68 limit of @xmath66",
    "yields an eigenstate of @xmath41 .",
    "this follows from ( [ eq : adiabatic ] ) but can also be seen from the explicit form of the zero mode @xmath53 in ( [ eq : poisson1 ] ) . using the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson1 ] ) , the @xmath69 limit is dominated by the nth term in the sum where n is the integer closest to @xmath70 and the dominant eigenvector is @xmath71 .",
    "this delineates the band structure of the spectrum .",
    "each periodic eigenstate @xmath72 on a single cell @xmath36 with eigenvalue @xmath73 corresponds to a band of bloch wave states @xmath74 on an infinite lattice with eigenvalues @xmath75 . in particular ,",
    "the lowest @xmath76 band of bloch wave states @xmath62 , is the zero mode band , with eigenvalues of @xmath41 given by @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , in the physical vacuum , the @xmath78 states with negative energy are filled , so the physical energy spectrum of the zero mode band is @xmath79 .",
    "this has the important implication that this band can be regarded as a compact brillouin zone by identifying the points @xmath80 and @xmath81 where left- and right handed states are degenerate and can mix .",
    "correspondingly , the adiabatic evolution across @xmath82 stays on the positive energy branch and thus changes from bloch waves built from @xmath53 for @xmath83 to bloch waves built from @xmath84 for @xmath78 .",
    "the connectivity of the positive energy branch across @xmath82 can be made more obvous by adding a small fermion mass term , which introduces a mass gap between the positive and negative energy states and smooths out the cusp in @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the evolution in k - space described by ( [ eq : adiabatic ] ) becomes adiabatic in the limit where the time period @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath27 , this corresponds to the weak field limit @xmath86 . in this limit ,",
    "the spectrum obtained from all of the bloch wave bands reproduces the full spectrum of a free massless dirac fermion @xmath87 but separated into bands , @xmath88 from the poisson transformed expression for the zero mode ( the second sum in ( [ eq : poisson2 ] ) ) , we see that the gaussian wavefunctions centered around each lattice cell become completely delocalized in the weak field limit @xmath69 .",
    "this is expected , since the radius of the landau orbits is going to infinity in this limit .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the opposite limit of strong field @xmath89 . from the second sum in ( [ eq : poisson2 ] )",
    "we see that the cell wave functions in the bloch wave become localized around each lattice site @xmath90 . in this limit",
    ", we expect that all of the bloch wave states in a given band ( i.e. all the states constructed from a particular periodic cell eigenstate with different momentum @xmath39 ) will be degenerate and separated by a finite gap from neighboring bands .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the qualitative effect of a finite background field @xmath25 is to introduce a mass gap which separates the @xmath76 band from the @xmath91 bands at @xmath92 .",
    "it is the berry phase around the bz for the @xmath76 band that provides a local definition of the topological parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the transition from @xmath83 to @xmath78 at the bz boundary @xmath92 has a simple physical interpretation . the strength of the field @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath39 , and the bz boundary at @xmath80 corresponds to an applied field with a half - unit of flux .",
    "if we try to evolve adiabatically beyond the bz boundary , the state suddenly shifts to @xmath81 .",
    "this indicates that one unit of charge has been transferred from the capacitor plate at @xmath93 to the one at @xmath94 .",
    "the net background field strength is now negative with a half - unit of flux .",
    "since @xmath25 flips sign as we go from @xmath95 to @xmath81 , the cell states flip from being left - handed ( clockwise ) to right - handed ( counterclockwise ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure , the direction of the arrow represents the flow of electric current ( dictated by the sign of @xmath25 ) , e.g. a left - handed mode , represented by a clockwise arrow , is either a clockwise - moving fermion or a counterclockwise - moving antifermion .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "2 , the transition from @xmath80 to @xmath81 results in the charge flow between two adjacent rows of orbitals adding instead of cancelling .",
    "it thus entails a net flow of current from one end of the spatial volume to the other . as we continue the evolution in @xmath39",
    ", we go from @xmath81 back to @xmath82 , and the local electric field in the bulk returns to zero .",
    "in contrast , the berry phase defined by the bloch wave states we have constructed increases from 0 to @xmath6 as we go once around the bz . for small values of applied field , @xmath1 is proportional to the local background electric field . but for larger applied field , mod @xmath6 changes in the value of @xmath1 keep track of the number of charges that have flowed to the boundaries . in this way",
    ", the berry phase definition of the local @xmath1 parameter for two - dimensional u(1 ) theory combines coleman s interpretation of @xmath1 as a background electric field with the understanding of quantized charge transport that is provided by topological insulator theory .",
    "in the preceeding section , we saw that the evolution of the bloch wave under transport around the zero - mode bz results in the net transfer of a unit of charge from one boundary to the other along the spatial axis .",
    "this is the cumulative effect of the spectral flow on each unit cell . for a filled band , a complete cycle of the momentum @xmath39 around",
    "the compact bz effectively transports the unit of charge at each site to the left by one lattice cell @xmath96 . on a given lattice cell ,",
    "this charge transport is associated with the spectral flow . on each lattice cell , we need a gauge transformation @xmath97 to recover periodicity in the time direction after evolution from @xmath98 ( @xmath82 ) to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) . at any intermediate value of @xmath39 , a gauge transformation by the bloch wave phase , @xmath101 ,",
    "transforms @xmath102 to @xmath48 but is not periodic in @xmath103 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath39 that appears in the hamiltonian is just @xmath104 , the spatial component of the vector potential . for any fixed @xmath39 ,",
    "the additional gauge phase induced by going from @xmath56 to @xmath105 across a unit cell is @xmath106 .",
    "this is just the link phase , i.e. the gauge group element which would be assigned to a link between two adjacent sites in a lattice formulation of the gauge field .",
    "the link phase is the gauge phase factor in the fermion hopping matrix , representing the transport of a quark between neighboring sites .",
    "we can now understand the connection between a discrete @xmath6 change of the berry phase and the operation of inserting a chern - simons membrane into the vacuum via a wilson line operator .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a chern - simons membrane is created by a surface integral of the chern - simons tensor , which reduces in the 2d u(1 ) case to an ordinary wilson line operator .",

    ", we consider the dirac hamiltonian on a 3-dimensional periodic cell in space . choosing a gauge where @xmath18 , the time - dependent schroedinger equation for the dirac zero mode can be cast as a formula for adiabatic evolution of hamiltonian eigenstates in the 3-momentum space of bloch wave states built from a lattice of unit cells .",
    "in the model of the qcd vacuum that seems to be favored by monte carlo results , the vacuum consists of a laminated stack of alternating sign membranes which are closely spaced in the direction transverse to the branes but flat and uniform over roughly the confinement scale in the other three euclidean directions .",
    "this strongly suggests that the berry connection needed to define the @xmath1 parameter can be reduced to a one - dimensional brillouin zone describing bloch wave momenta transverse to the branes .",
    "a fluctuation of @xmath1 thus describes the transverse polarization of the + and - topological charge membrane pairs . from the point of view of quark eigenstates ,",
    "the membrane polarization fluctuations described by @xmath1 represent goldstone fluctuations of the chiral consensate .",
    "we note that the spectral flow in k - space on a cell is implemented by a generally nonperiodic gauge transformation @xmath147 on the open line segment @xmath148 which zeros out the @xmath104 gauge link . in the 2d case , the bloch wave momentum is just given by the mismatch between gauge phases on opposite sides of the cell , @xmath149 to explicitly construct @xmath150 for 4d qcd , we choose the x - axis to be transverse to the branes and consider , as in ( [ eq : thetak ] ) , the gauge variation of the cs charge @xmath145 integrated over a spatial unit cell that is a thin slab of space between two adjacent , oppositely charge branes at @xmath57 and @xmath151 . @xmath152 here the gauge phases on the two boundaries are given by wzw 2-forms integrated over the 2-dimensional spatial surface of the branes . @xmath153",
    "the integrand depends on both the in - brane components of the color field and on the color gauge phase @xmath154 . for a closely spaced brane - antibrane pair , a fluctuation of the relative color phase is equivalent to a fluctuation of the transverse gauge link between them . expanding to lowest order in the brane separation ,",
    "@xmath155 here we have defined an effective bloch wave momentum parameter @xmath156 which determines the relative wzw phase on adjacent branes . just as in the 2-dimensional case , the phase difference across the unit cell represents the transport of quark charge from boundary to boundary .",
    "the transfer of an integer number of quarks is described by a periodic but topologically nontrivial gauge transformation corresponding to integer valued @xmath39 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : thetaberry ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) define a constant berry connection , just as in the two - dimensional case , @xmath157    equation ( [ eq : bcon ] ) defines the berry phase for a topological transition which starts and ends with unpolarized brane - antibrane pairs .",
    "the positive branes have each moved over by one step and become coincident with the anti - brane from the next pair to the left . for more general connections , the integral of @xmath58 around",
    "the bz defines @xmath61 , an order parameter describing the local polarization of the brane - antibrane pairs in the vacuum .",
    "a long wavelength polarization wave corresponds to a plane wave gauge transformation by a bloch wave factor @xmath147 with small @xmath39 . for the 2d u(1 )",
    "case , the bloch factor is just the relative phase of the small gauge transformation @xmath147 on adjacent branes . for 4d qcd",
    "the bloch wave is defined by a slowly varying @xmath132 color gauge transformation @xmath158 .",
    "the @xmath159 chiral phase @xmath61 that describes the polarization of brane - antibrane pairs is determined from the color phase via the wzw 2-form evaluated on adjacent brane surfaces ..",
    "we have shown that the topological structure of the vacuum of qcd and the role of @xmath1 as a local order parameter can be formulated in terms of a berry connection whose structure and physical significance is closely analogous to the theory of topological insulators . on a heuristic level , it is not surprising that a berry phase construction is the appropriate way to describe the short range topological structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "a central feature of most applications of the berry connection is the existence of two distinct time scales in a problem , so that one can distinguish between `` fast '' and `` slow '' variables , with the slow variables being regarded as parameters in the hamiltonian for the fast variables .",
    "a berry connection can then be defined from the phase of hamiltonian eigenstates under adiabatic change of the slow variables . for the vacuum of qcd ,",
    "the fast variables are the short wavelength fluctuations of topological charge in the direction transverse to the branes , where the sign of the charge alternates rapidly at the scale of the lattice cutoff .",
    "this short range structure is explored by the berry connection as we take the bloch wave momentum around the bz . in the continuum limit ,",
    "what survives of the short range lattice structure is the bulk polarization of the membranes , corresponding to small fluctuations of @xmath1 , and the possibility of domain walls corresponding to boundaries marking discrete changes of @xmath1 by @xmath17 .",
    "the relationship between topological charge membranes and the chiral condensate has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the berry phase construction provides some additional insight into this connection .",
    "a well - known consequence of the axial u(1 ) anomaly is that a global change of @xmath1 is equivalent to a global chiral rotation .",
    "the berry connection defined by ( [ eq : thetaberry ] ) extends this to a local relationship . because of the axial u(1 ) anomaly , the flavor singlet axial - vector current which is conserved in the chiral limit",
    "is not gauge invariant but rather varies in the same way as the chern - simons current under a color gauge transformation , @xmath160 . in the gauge variation of the integral ( [ eq : theta ] )",
    ", the cs charge @xmath145 can be replaced by the integral of the axial u(1 ) charge over the lattice cell , i.e. the generator of a chiral rotation on the cell , @xmath161 the berry phase @xmath1 can thus be regarded as a local chiral rotation angle . in pure glue qcd without quarks , there are no physical massless goldstone bosons . as discussed in ( @xcite ) , a massless pole must appear in the chern - simons current correlator , as required for nonzero topological susceptibility .",
    "however , this pole is cancelled by the massless pole in the @xmath162 correlator in any gauge invariant amplitude . for 1-flavor qcd ,",
    "the quark and antiquark in a pseudoscalar @xmath163 meson are on an adjacent pair of oppositely charged branes , and the gauge link between them is modulated by the spacing between the branes . in this way , fluctuations of the membrane polarization @xmath1 generate goldstone fluctuations of the chiral condensate . for the 1-flavor case , the @xmath164 goldstone boson couples to the pure - glue cs current by quark - antiquark annihilation , which takes place via topologically nontrivial brane fluctuations ( since it requires the transport of a unit of quark charge between branes ) .",
    "this generates the @xmath163 mass . for two or more flavors of quark we can construct nonsinglet goldstone bosons with the quark and antiquark on adjacent branes carrying different flavors . with no @xmath164 annihilation , the long - wavelength fluctuations of the brane polarization @xmath1 generate massless goldstone pions .",
    "the picture of the chiral condensate which emerges from the berry phase construction has some similarity to the model of the chiral condensate in an instanton liquid @xcite . in that model , the condensate is formed from the approximate thooft zero modes of the dirac operator on localized instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "the membrane model of the chiral condensate that we have discussed here shares one aspect of the instanton liquid model , in that the condensate is formed from approximate topological dirac zero modes .",
    "but in the instanton picture it is difficult to understand long range propagation of massless goldstone bosons in terms of localized  thooft modes .",
    "by contrast , in the membrane model , the dirac modes which form the condensate are surface modes on the boundaries between discrete vacua .",
    "the delocalized nature of the membrane surface modes makes the long range propagation of goldstone bosons much more plausible ."
