    ", if the response variable takes the form of poisson distributed count data ( e.g.  photon counts from a ccd ) , then the equidispersion property of the poisson , which prescribes a local variance equal to its conditional mean , will directly violate the key linear regression assumption of _ homoscedasticity _ ( a common global variance independent of the linear predictors ) .",
    "moreover , adopting a simple linear regression in this context means to ignore another defining feature of the poisson : its ability to model data with only non - negative integers .",
    "similar concerns arise for modelling bernoulli and binomial distributed data ( i.e. , on / off , yes / no ) where regression methods optimized for continuous and unbounded response variables are of limited assistance @xcite .",
    "yet , data analysis challenges of this sort arise routinely in the course of astronomical research : for example , in efforts to characterize exoplanet multiplicity as a function of host multiplicity and orbital separation ( poisson distributed data ; @xcite ) , or to model the dependence of the galaxy bar fraction on total stellar mass and redshift ( bernoulli distributed data ; @xcite ) . for such regression problems",

    "this is known as generalized linear models ( glms ) .",
    "basic glms include normal or gaussian regression , gamma and inverse gaussian models , and the discrete response binomial , poisson and negative binomial models .",

    "@xcite and @xcite laid the foundations of the glm estimation algorithm , which is a subset of maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "the algorithm they devised in early software development is for the most part still used today in the majority of glm implementations  both in commercial statistical packages ( e.g.  spss and sas ) and in freeware - type packages ( e.g.  r and python ) .",
    "glms have received a great deal of attention in the statistical literature .",

    "there have been only a handful of astronomical studies applying glm techniques such as logistic regression ( e.g.  @xcite ) , poisson regression ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; and the importance of modelling overdispersion in count data ( as facilitated by the negative binomial glm ) has only lately become appreciated through cosmological research @xcite .",
    "hence , in this series of papers we aim to demonstrate the vast potential of glms to assist with both exploratory and advanced astronomical data analyses through the application to a variety of astronomical inference problems .",
    "the astronomical case studies explored herein focus on an investigation of the statistical properties of baryons inside simulated high - redshift haloes , including detailed chemistry , gas physics and stellar feedback .",
    "the response variables are categorical with two possible outcomes and therefore bernoulli distributed . in our particular case , these correspond to either ( i ) the presence / absence of star formation activity , or ( ii ) metallicity above / below the critical metallicity ( @xmath13 ) associated with the first generation of stars .",

    "there are two popular choices : the _ logit _ function , @xmath54 and the _ probit _ function , @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the normal distribution function .",
    "the choice of link function defining the _ logit _ predicted value , @xmath11 , @xmath57 or the _ probit _ predicted value , @xmath58 accordingly .",
    "both link functions describe sigmoid curves smoothly and monotonically increasing from @xmath59 at @xmath60 to @xmath61 at @xmath62 with the greatest rate of change occurring at @xmath63 , as displayed in fig [ fig : links ] .",
    "the logit function is most commonly preferred in clinical research applications where outcomes are most naturally described in terms of the odds - ratio , @xmath64 ( e.g.  the relationship between the odds - ratio of patient recovery / non - recovery and the concentration of an administered drug ) ; whereas the probit function is often presented within bayesian statistical applications exploiting an associated gibbs sampling algorithm .",
    "sigmoid curves such as those described by the logit and probit functions may already be seen in empirical / phenomenological astronomical models : for example , in describing the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of mass and/or environmental density @xcite .    a reason for employing logit or probit regression to model binary response data is to obtain for objects with only @xmath65 observations , but no observed @xmath66 s , the predicted probabilities that the unobserved response variable has the value 1 indicating `` success '' , however that is defined ( e.g. , `` galaxy is quenched '' , `` star hosts planet '' ) .",
    "both models usually produce similar probabilities ; though probit regression is not as commonly used for assessing the relationship of a predictor to the response since the interpretation of the exponentiated coefficient of a logit predictor as an odds ratio is a desirable feature of that model .",
    "probit regression is normally used when a continuous variable is dichotomized so that it becomes a binary response .",
    "it is worth noting that , while other well known machine learning algorithms ( e.g. , support vector machines , k - nearest neighbourhood ) can be used for binary classification tasks , their main focus is prediction rather than modelling . in other words ,",
    "their aim is to find a functional algorithm @xmath67 that operates on @xmath51 to predict the responses @xmath50 .",
    "glms , on the other hand , represent a data modelling philosophy , which assumes the sample to be generated by a stochastic process , e.g. , gamma , poisson , with bernoulli being the case study here . while the former may lead to a more accurate prediction for complex problems ,",
    "although there are plenty of glm extensions for such cases , the later allows a clearer interpretation of the relationship between the predictor and response variables ( see  [ sec : application ] ) .          despite the growing popularity of bayesian statistical analysis in the physical sciences the mle approach to glm fitting",
    "remains the default in the majority of statistical software packages : for this reason , and its historical significance ( cf .",
    "the extensive treatment given by @xcite ) , we describe this approach first .    with the likelihood of the dataset fully specified by the linear predictor , @xmath68 , and the choice of response variable distribution and link function of the glm , the corresponding likelihood function for regression is both readily tractable and easily evaluated computationally .",
    "iterative algorithms operating on the negative log - likelihood , such as the iteratively re - weighted least squares procedure used by ` glm ` @xcite , thus provide a fast computational strategy for recovering the mle solution .",
    "the output from a standard mle glm fitting code will typically be a list containing : ( i ) a mle estimate , @xmath69 , for the @xmath70 component of each candidate predictor variable , @xmath71 ; ( ii ) the associated estimate of its standard error , @xmath72 , from which approximate confidence intervals ( ci ) on @xmath70 may be obtained using the normal distribution function ( e.g.  a 95% ci : @xmath73 ) ; and ( iii ) a @xmath44-value computed from the wald test using ( i ) and ( ii ) , required for significance testing of the given predictor variable .",
    "the wald test determines how significant a predictor variable is , where for the glm case it tests the predictor parameter values , @xmath74 , versus hypothesized values , @xmath75 ( often @xmath76 for logistic models ) , and is based on mle .",
    "the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath75 divided by the standard error , @xmath77 , of the residuals follows an approximate gaussian distribution . for a specific estimate",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "estimation of ( ii ) is by way of the observed information matrix according to asymptotic convergence theory for mle estimation",
    ".    in r the glm procedure may be called to perform mle estimation of the logistic regression model using the general syntax shown in [ sec : scripts ] .",
    "the bayesglm function in the cran arm package is commonly used to estimate bayesian logistic models @xcite .",
    "the code used to estimate this class of models is based on r s default glm function ( see [ sec : scripts ] ) .",
    "normal and jeffreys priors have traditionally been favoured for use with continuous predictors in logit regression ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; though more recently the cauchy has been strongly promoted as an optimal default prior @xcite .",
    "it is also recommended that continuous predictors be centered if not fully standardized , where @xmath82 is the standardized variable , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 represent the sample mean and standard deviation respectively . ] , if the predictor is not linearly related to the response ; withal , standardizing continuous predictors help convergence , when entered into a bayesian glm , since it puts them on the same scale . care must always be taken to assure that a default prior s use with the data makes sense ; to this end visual inspection of mock datasets generated from the prior  likelihood pairing unconstrained by the data can serve as an effective check . to this end `` functional uniform '' priors provide another means to limit prior - sensitivity in the shape of the preferred fitting function ; cf .  @xcite . for the purposes of the present study we follow the cauchy prior recommendations of @xcite .",
    "use of the probit link function for bayesian glm regression has become a popular choice owing to the availability of an exact gibbs sampling algorithm for this model presented by @xcite .",
    "the novelty of their algorithm is a data augmentation scheme in which an additional latent variable is added for each observation having standard normal distribution with mean set by the linear predictor , from which the likelihood of the observed response is determined according to whether or not this latent variable is above or below zero .",
    "although the general sampler of the ` arm ` package does not in fact implement the @xcite scheme , it is important to note its availability for use in more complex bayesian hierarchical models built on the glm framework ( e.g.  for the case of errors - in - variable glm regression with binary distributions for both predictor and response variable , such as can arise in comparing the sensitivity of two alternative tests ) .",
    "the basic syntax for using bayesian probit glm in r is summarized in [ sec : scripts ] . the same criteria for the use of priors that we discussed for logit models above also maintain for probit models . however ,",
    "if the analyst desires to interpret the coefficients in terms of odds or risk ratios , a logit model must be used , regardless if the model is based on mle or bayesian methods .",
    "within this section we demonstrate the application of the binomial regression techniques introduced above to answer questions from an exploratory analysis of our cosmological hydro - simulation dataset that could not be addressed by standard linear regression methods .",
    "this is because probability of occurrence for a binary outcome is bounded between 0 and 1 , while the underlying theory of linear regression allows realizations with values out of this range . rather than exhaust all possible techniques for a single dataset ,",
    "our aim is to demonstrate practical differences between distinct types of binary regression : i ) bayesian vs mle approach , both with the standard logit link (  [ maxlikeglm],[bayeslr ] ) ; ii ) bayesian regression comparing logit vs probit link functions (  [ bayeslr],[bayespr ] ) . in the first case we consider the star formation activity connection with a preselected ( physically motivated ) set of predictor variables : @xmath35 and @xmath15 .",
    "alternatively , in our later analysis of the metallicity content of the galaxies , we use an automatic criterion to select the best choice of predictor variables among the entire set of halo features , or in other words the variable combination that minimizes the akaike information criterion ( aic ; * ? ? ?",

    "the formation of the first metal - free stars in the universe ended the cosmic dark ages @xcite and began the production of elements heavier than lithium @xcite .",

    "this is particularly relevant to avoid the risk of model over - fitting .",
    "an over - fitted model captures aberrations on the training set that render the model useless during prediction .",
    "a popular approach to model validation makes use of resampling techniques @xcite .    in the resampling technique known as @xmath46-fold cross validation ,",
    "the data is divided into @xmath46 folds ( subsamples ) of equal size .",

    "roc curves provide both a visually and quantitative approach to report on the accuracy of predictions for binary classifiers .",

    "the technique consists of plotting the true positive rate ( tpr or sensitivity ) vs the false positive rate ( fpr or specificity ) as we vary the decision boundary @xmath122 .",
    "the variation in the decision boundary enables us to assess the performance of the classifier under unequal error costs ( i.e. , under scenarios where the cost of a false positive is different from a false negative ) .",
    "specifically , to generate a roc curve we make use of two measurements : @xmath163 where tp = true positives , fp = false positives , tn = true negatives , and fn = false negatives . for example",

    "the sensitivity ( specificity ) would quantify the ability of the method to correctly identify galaxies with ( without ) sf : the closer to 1 these values are , the more successful the analysis is .",

    "an ideal roc curve goes from ( 0,0 ) to ( 0,1 ) to ( 1,1 ) . a quantitative approach",
    "to assess the quality of a roc curve is to calculate the area under the curve ( auc ) , as a fraction of the area under the ideal curve , as often done in cases of discrepancy or inequality measurements ( since e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "higher values of auc correspond to more accurate classifiers , while a value of 0.5 corresponds to a random classifier @xcite .",
    "the roc curve can be used to access the optimal @xmath122 , which is a trade - off between sensitivity and specificity . in order words",
    ", it is the one corresponding to the coordinate with minimum distance from ( 0,1 ) , where both sensitivity and specificity are maximum .",
    "this is essential to ultimately assign a class membership for each data .",
    "a visual analysis of this classification scheme is made via the confusion matrix , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "a complementary diagnostics method is the confusion matrix @xmath165 , which captures information about the actual and predicted classifications of a particular learning algorithm or classifier @xcite .",
    "columns in @xmath165 correspond to actual classes , whereas rows correspond to predicted classes ( e.g. , @xmath166 ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix contain the number of cases where the actual and predicted class agree , e.g. , @xmath167 contains the number of cases where class @xmath168 was predicted correctly .",

    "while @xmath174 , @xmath145 , and @xmath175 together have a non - negligible contribution to explain the metallicity enrichment above / below @xmath13 with an auc = 0.74 , the molecular fraction , @xmath86 , clearly stands out as the most important parameter .",
    "this suggests that the level of molecular gas fraction has a strong connection with the level of metal content in primordial haloes .",

    "we stress that the above comparison should not be extrapolated to imply that glms are better suited for binary classification prediction than anns , but for this particular and somewhat simple problem , both are equally good .",
    "the main advantages of glms are their portability and interpretation of the coefficients .",
    "moreover , the possibility to approach the problem from a bayesian perspective is extremely beneficial when dealing with inherent issues of observational data , such as errors - in - variables , selection bias , etc @xcite .    .",

    "also worth noting is that the potential of glm regression goes far beyond binary classification .",
    "many data situations involve discrete data , but are nevertheless modelled as if the response variable were continuous .",
    "if the data are modelled as discrete , it is by employing a poisson model , without due regard for the corresponding distributional assumption of equality between mean and variance ( equidispersion ) .",

    "which assume that the counts being modelled are being generated from more than one source .",
    "there are situation where the classic glm assumption of uncorrelated measurements fails , e.g. , for repeated measurements from the same object . for theses cases ,",
    "plenty of extensions exist , such as generalized estimating equations @xcite . additionally , there are generalized additive models , non - parametric quantile count models , models with endogenous stratification , panel models , and 3-parameter count models , to name only a few .",
    "glms are of common use in the statistical literature , but almost _ terra incognita _ in astronomical data analysis , with only few recent notable applications of logistic regression ( e.g.  @xcite ) , poisson regression ( e.g.  @xcite ) and negative binomial regression @xcite .    finally , we highlight the vast potential of glms and extended glms for the astronomical community through their possible application to a plethora of astronomical problems , such as : photometric redshift estimation ( gamma distributed data ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> revealing hidden patterns in astronomical data is often the path to fundamental scientific breakthroughs ; meanwhile the complexity of scientific inquiry increases as more subtle relationships are sought . </S>",

    "<S> , astronomers have overlooked a whole family of statistical techniques for exploratory data analysis and robust regression , the so - called generalized linear models ( glms ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S>  the first in a series aimed at illustrating the power of these methods in astronomical applications  we elucidate the potential of a particular class of glms for handling binary / binomial data , the so - called logit and probit regression techniques , from both a maximum likelihood and a bayesian perspective . as a case in point , we present the use of these glms to explore the conditions of star formation activity and metal enrichment in primordial minihaloes from cosmological hydro - simulations including detailed chemistry , gas physics , and stellar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that for a dark mini - halo with metallicity @xmath0 , an increase of @xmath1 in the gas molecular fraction , increases the probability of star formation occurrence by a factor of 75% . finally , we highlight the use of receiver operating characteristic curves as a diagnostic for binary classifiers , and ultimately we use these to demonstrate the competitive predictive performance of glms against the popular technique of artificial neural networks .    </S>",
