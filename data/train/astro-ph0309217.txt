    "many ground based telescopes have tried to detect optical afterglows of grbs and to measure their redshifts by using the spectral absorption and/or emission lines of the interstellar matter in the host galaxy . however , the number of grbs with measured redshift is only a fraction of all grbs detected with batse , bepposax , hete - ii and integral satellites ; we have still only about 30 grbs with the known redshifts .",
    "the most of them occur at the cosmological distance , and the current record holder is grb  000131 at @xmath6 @xcite . according to the brightness distribution of grbs with the known redshifts , the above satellites should have already detected much more distant grbs , such as at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if we can establish a method for estimating the intrinsic brightness from the characteristics of the prompt gamma - ray emission , we can use the brightness of the grb as a lighthouse to determine the unknown redshifts of majority of grbs , which enables us to explore the early universe out to @xmath7 .    using the geometrical corrections of the collimated jets",
    ", @xcite and @xcite revealed that the bolometric energies released in the prompt emission are tightly clustering around the standard energy of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the explosion energy of grbs can be used as a standard candle as the supernovae . however , the apparent brightness of grbs strongly depends on the jet opening angle and the viewing angle . to use the grb as the standard candle , we need to correct such effects .",
    "several authors tried to establish a method for estimating the isotropic luminosity from the observed grb properties . using the lightcurves of the prompt gamma - ray emissions ,",
    "some pioneering works have been done ; the variability ",
    "luminosity relation reported by @xcite , which indicates that the variable grbs are much brighter than the smooth ones .",
    "the spectral time - lag , which is the interval of the peak arrival times between two different energy bands , also correlates with the isotropic luminosity @xcite .",
    "these properties based on the time - series data might be due to the effect of the viewing angle from the grb jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , based on the spectral analyses with the k - correction @xcite , @xcite found the correlation between the isotropic - equivalent energy radiated in grbs and the peak energies @xmath0 , which is the energy at the peak of @xmath9 spectrum .",
    "@xcite suggested a possibility of the empirical redshift indicator , which is based on the @xmath0 and the arrival number of photons .    applying these luminosity indicators to the grbs with the unknown redshifts ,",
    "their redshifts can be estimated from the apparent gamma - ray brightness . as a natural application of the obtained redshift distribution ,",
    "the grb formation rates are discussed by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "especially , using mathematically rigid method @xcite , @xcite have estimated the grb formation rates from the variability  luminosity relation .",
    "these works give basically the same results ; the grb formation rate rapidly increases with the redshift at @xmath10 , and it keeps on rising up to higher redshift ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the grb formation rate did not decrease with @xmath11 in contrast with the star formation rates ( sfrs ) measured in uv , optical and infrared band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we establish a new calibration formula of the redshift based on the @xmath0luminosity relation of the brightest peak of the prompt gamma - ray emission from 9 grbs with the known redshifts .",
    "importantly , the uncertainty of our formula is much less than those of the previous works ( lag , variability ) as shown in section 3 . applying the obtained calibration , in section 4",
    ", we estimate the redshifts of 684 grbs with the unknown redshifts .",
    "we then demonstrate the grb formation rate out to @xmath5 and the luminosity evolution using the non - parametric method @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the grb formation rate derived by us is based on the spectral analysis for the first time , and its uncertainty is well controlled in a small level . throughout the paper , we assume the flat - isotropic universe with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we used 9 grbs ( 970508 , 970828 , 971214 , 980703 , 990123 , 990506 , 990510 , 991216 , and 000131 ) in the batse archive with the known redshifts , and focused on the brightest peak in each grb .",
    "we performed the spectral analysis with the standard data reduction for each grb .",
    "we subtracted the background spectrum , which was derived from the average spectrum before and after the grb in the same data set .",
    "we adopted the spectral model of smoothly broken power - law @xcite .",
    "the model function is described below .",
    "@xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath18 is in units of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the energy at the spectral break .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 is the low- and high - energy power - law index , respectively . for the case of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the peak energy can be derived as @xmath25 , which corresponds to the energy at the maximum flux in @xmath9 spectra .",
    "the isotropic luminosity can be calculated with the observed flux as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the luminosity distance and the observed energy flux , respectively .",
    "in figure  [ fig : ep - lumi1 ] , we show the observed isotropic luminosity in units of @xmath29 as a function of the peak energy , @xmath30 , in the rest frame of each grb . for one of our sample ( grb  980703 ) , a lower limit of @xmath30 is set because the spectral index @xmath31 .",
    "the results of bepposax reported by @xcite are also plotted in the same figure . here",
    ", we converted their peak fluxes into the same energy range of 30  10000 kev in our analysis with their spectral parameters .",
    "there is a good positive correlation between the @xmath30 and the @xmath32 .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient including the weighting factors is 0.957 for 15 degree of freedom ( 17 samples with firm redshift estimates ) for the @xmath33 $ ] and the @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the chance probability is @xmath35 .",
    "when we adopt the power - law model as the @xmath0luminosity relation , the best - fit function is @xmath36^{1.94 \\pm 0.19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the uncertainties are 1  @xmath37 error .",
    "this relation agrees well with the standard synchrotron model , @xmath38 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0luminosity relation derived in the previous section seems to be much better estimator of the isotropic luminosity compared with the spectral time - lag and the variability of grbs @xcite since the chance probability is extremely low . in this section , using the @xmath0luminosity relation , we try to estimate the isotropic luminosities and the redshifts of the batse grbs with the unknown redshifts .",
    "we first selected about 1000 grbs in a class of the long duration of @xmath39 detected by batse , and extracted the brightest pulse in each grb .",
    "we performed the spectral analysis for these peaks with the same method described in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "once we obtained observed energy - flux @xmath40 and @xmath0 at the observer s rest frame , we can estimate the redshift with equation  ( [ eq : l - ep ] ) and the luminosity distance as a function of the redshift .",
    "we could not determine @xmath0 for @xmath41 % of samples because of @xmath31 within 1  @xmath37 uncertainty , and excluded them .",
    "after setting the flux limit of @xmath42 , which is based on the dimmest one ( grb  970508 ) , on the data set of @xmath43 plane , 684 samples are remained . in figure",
    "[ fig : z - lumi ] , we show the sample distribution in @xmath43 plane with the truncation by the flux limit .",
    "the normalized cumulative luminosity function at each redshift bin is also shown in figure  [ fig : z - lumi ] .",
    "the shape of these luminosity functions are similar to each other , but the break - luminosity seems to increase toward the higher redshift .",
    "this indicates that a luminosity evolution is hidden in the @xmath43 plane in figure  [ fig : z - lumi ] .",
    "therefore , we have to remove the effect of the luminosity evolution from the data set before discussing the real luminosity function and the grb formation rate .",
    "this is because the univariate distribution of the redshift and the luminosity can be estimated only when they are independent of each other .",
    "we used the non - parametric method @xcite , which were used for the quasar samples and first applied to the grb samples by @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity function @xmath44 can be written @xmath45 without the loss of generality . here",
    ", each function means the luminosity evolution @xmath46 , the density evolution @xmath47 and the local luminosity function @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "although the parameter @xmath49 represents the shape of the luminosity function , we will ignored the effect of this parameter because the shape of the luminosity function is approximately same as shown in figure  [ fig : z - lumi ] .",
    "we do not mention more about the method , but the details are found in @xcite .    assuming the functional form of the luminosity evolution as @xmath50 , which is also used in @xcite and @xcite , we convert the data set of @xmath43 to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "we search the best value of @xmath53 giving the independent set of @xmath51 within the significance of @xmath54 error , and it is found to be @xmath55 . once we obtain the independent data set of the @xmath51 , we can generate the cumulative luminosity function @xmath56 with a simple formula ( see equation  ( 14 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : lumi - func ] , we show the cumulative luminosity function calculated by the formula .",
    "this function is approximately described by @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "we can also obtain the cumulative number distribution @xmath62 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the differential form of the function is useful for the purpose of comparison with the star formation rates in other wave bands .",
    "we convert @xmath62 into the differential form with the following equation .",
    "@xmath63 where the additional factor of @xmath64 comes from the cosmological time dilation , and @xmath65 is a differential comoving volume . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , we show the relative comoving grb rate @xmath47 in unit proper volume .",
    "we have investigated the spectral property of the brightest peak of each grb with the known redshifts , and have found a fine correlation between the peak energy @xmath30 and the isotropic luminosity . while this correlation against a smaller sample has been pointed out by some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have succeeded in combining the results of bepposax and batse to describe equation  ( [ eq : l - ep ] ) .    using the new @xmath0luminosity relation ,",
    "we have estimated the redshifts of 684 grbs with the unknown redshifts .",
    "we found the existence of the luminosity evolution @xmath55 for grb samples as shown in figure  [ fig : z - lumi ] .",
    "the null - hypothesis of the luminosity evolution is rejected about @xmath66 significance .",
    "@xcite also suggest the presence of the luminosity evolution as @xmath67 .",
    "these two values are consistent with each other .",
    "the luminosity evolutions are found in other objects .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite estimated the luminosity evolution of the qso samples as @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "based on the observation of subaru deep field and a photometric redshift estimation for @xmath70-band selected galaxy samples , @xcite found the strong luminosity evolution in the rest uv band of their galaxies .",
    "the form of the cumulative luminosity function is independent of @xmath11 except for the break luminosity , which changes with @xmath11 .",
    "we propose that figure  [ fig : lumi - func ] might include important information on the jets responsible for the prompt @xmath71-ray emissions and a distribution of their opening angles . consider an extremely simple model for a uniform jet with an opening half - angle @xmath72 and a constant geometrically - corrected luminosity @xmath73 , which is viewed from an angle of @xmath74 .",
    "then , in a crude approximation the luminosity @xmath32 is given by @xmath75 for the case of @xmath76 , @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath77 , where @xmath78^{-1 } \\propto \\theta_v^{-2}$ ] , so that the luminosity has the dependence of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 is determined in order that two functions in equation  ( [ eq : l - theta ] ) are continuously connected at @xmath81 .",
    "we also consider the distribution of @xmath72 in the form @xmath82 when @xmath83 .",
    "then , easy calculations show that in the case of @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 this is a broken power low with the break luminosity @xmath86",
    ". then if @xmath87 with @xmath88 , we can roughly reproduce figure  [ fig : lumi - func ] .",
    "this suggests that either the maximum opening half angle of the jet decreases or @xmath73 increases as a function of the redshift .",
    "this work is the first study to generate the grb formation rate with @xmath0luminosity relation .",
    "the result indicates that the grb formation rate always increases toward @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous works using the grb variability @xcite and the spectral time - lag @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , grb formation rate is proportional to @xmath89 for @xmath90 and to @xmath91 for @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sfr measured in uv , optical , and infrared is proportional to @xmath93 for @xmath90 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to @xmath94 for @xmath92 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we find that the ratio of the grb formation rate to the sfr evolves along redshift , say @xmath95 .",
    "recently , it has been strongly suggested that the long duration grbs arise from the collapse of a massive star @xcite .",
    "hence our result implies that either the formation rate of the massive star or the fraction of grb progenitor in massive stars at the high redshift should be significantly greater than the present value .",
    "however , if the sfr rapidly increases along redshift as suggested by @xcite , the fraction of grb progenitors does not change so much .",
    "the existence of the luminosity evolution of grbs , i.e. , @xmath96 , may suggest the evolution of grb progenitor itself ( e.g. , mass ) or the jet evolution . although the jet opening angle evolution was suggested @xcite , in our extremely simple model , either the maximum jet opening angle decreases or the jet total energy increases . in the former case",
    "the grb formation rate shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] may be an underestimate since the chance probability to observe the high redshift grb will decrease .",
    "if so , the evolution of the ratio of the grb formation rate to the sfr becomes more rapid . on the other hand ,",
    "in the latter case , grb formation rate of figure  [ fig : sfr ] gives a reasonable estimate .",
