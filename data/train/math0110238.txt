    "using the formula ( due to bill gosper @xcite ) @xmath12 fabrice bellard ( * ? ? ?",
    "* file pi1.c ) found an algorithm for computing the @xmath3-th decimal of @xmath13 without computing the earlier ones .",
    "thus he improved an earlier algorithm due to simon plouffe @xcite .",
    "this formula can be proved in the following way .",
    "we have @xmath14 hence the right hand side of the formula will be @xmath15 but @xmath16",
    "so we get @xmath17 _ 0 ^ 1=\\pi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then asked if there are other such formulas of type @xmath18 where @xmath2 is a polynomial in @xmath3 . using the same trick as before we have @xmath19 and hence @xmath20 if @xmath2 has degree @xmath21 then @xmath22 where @xmath23 has degree @xmath24 .",
    "it follows with @xmath25 that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a polynomial in @xmath28 of degree @xmath29 .",
    "we want this integral to be equal to @xmath13 . a good way to get",
    "@xmath13 is to have @xmath30 or arctan@xmath31 after integration .",
    "this means that @xmath32 must have the factor @xmath33 or @xmath34 , that is have a zero at @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "this restricts @xmath9 and @xmath10 and gives the value of @xmath11 . after experimenting with the lll - algorithm we found formulas for @xmath13 in the following cases ( there could be many more ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,<,^ , < \" , ]      this formula was used in bellard s world record setting computation of the 1000 billionth _",
    "binary _ digit of @xmath0 , being based on the algorithm in @xcite . ]",
    "e.g. , to find the formula in the last case we computed @xmath37 for @xmath38 with @xmath39 digits .",
    "then the lll - algorithm found ( in about three days ) the linear combination between @xmath13 and @xmath40 .",
    "a good check is that the coefficient of @xmath13 is a product of small primes ( actually all less than @xmath41 ) .",
    "for @xmath42 the integrals can be computed by brute force using _",
    "maple_. the higher cases are all symmetric , i.e. , @xmath43 . using the symmetry",
    "@xmath44 one can assume that @xmath30 and @xmath45 each contribute @xmath46 .",
    "so we make the wild assumption that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a polynomial with @xmath49 .",
    "differentiation with respect to @xmath28 yields @xmath50 or @xmath51 this is a differential equation of first order in @xmath52 with polynomial coefficients . taking the case @xmath53 ,",
    "we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so the denominator @xmath56 has degree @xmath57 . we solve the differential equation using _ maple _",
    "s @xmath58 setting the order to @xmath59",
    ". then we find that @xmath52 is a polynomial of degree @xmath60 . in practice one",
    "replaces the coefficients of @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath63 times the denominator in the formula found for @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath52 will have ( huge ) integer coefficients .",
    "computing the integral in the case @xmath64 , _ maple _ got the terms @xmath65 which can be shown to be equal to @xmath66 in the nonsymmetric case @xmath67 one gets @xmath45 and @xmath68 , but the latter term makes no contribution since it has the same values at @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "when we set this up then , in principle , we could let _",
    "maple _ do the evaluation of @xmath71 ( and thus of @xmath27 ) through , i.e. , let _ maple _ s formal summation routines compute the sum @xmath72 or , to make the point clearly visible , compute a sum of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a certain polynomial in @xmath3 .",
    "however , it turns out that this is very time - consuming .",
    "it is a much better idea to expand @xmath74 as @xmath75 , and then use that @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "see also the approach that we follow in section  [ sec : proof ] when we prove our main result .",
    "solving the differential equation for @xmath48 one finds that @xmath48 has the factor@xmath80 . if one divides out the factor @xmath81 , the remaining factor is invariant under the substitution @xmath82 .",
    "hence we make the substitution @xmath83 where @xmath84 then @xmath85 now @xmath86",
    "so @xmath87 and @xmath88 it follows that the left hand side of the differential equation is @xmath89 on the right hand side we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 is for all @xmath8 divisible by @xmath92 hence @xmath93 and @xmath91 and @xmath94 are all polynomials in @xmath95 . finally we get the following differential equation for @xmath96 : @xmath97    if @xmath93 is known then one solves this equation for @xmath96 just as before ( but the degrees are cut in half ) .",
    "but there is a possibility to _ find _ the formula for @xmath13 _ and prove _ it _ in one stroke_. let @xmath98 and assume that @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 substituting this into the differential equation we will get a system of linear equations for the @xmath102 s of size @xmath103 . if this system is nonsingular , we can be sure to be able to solve it and thus _ find and prove _ an expansion for @xmath0 of the form .",
    "we went ( again ) to the computer and generated the system of equations for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath104 be the matrix of the system .",
    "let further @xmath105 be the least common denominator of the coefficients of @xmath106 .",
    "we obtained the following tables :    l|l @xmath8 & @xmath107 +   + 1 & @xmath108 + 2 & @xmath109 + 3 & @xmath110 + 4 & @xmath111 + 5 & @xmath112    r|l @xmath8 & @xmath113 +   + 1 & @xmath114 + 2 & @xmath115 + 3 & @xmath116 + 4 & @xmath117 + 5 & @xmath118 + 6 & @xmath119 + 7 & @xmath120 + 8 & @xmath121 + 9 & @xmath122 + 10 & @xmath123    from the table it seems  obvious \" that the determinant of @xmath104 will never vanish as it grows rather quickly in absolute value with @xmath8 .",
    "we also see that the same primes occur in the factorizations of @xmath105 and @xmath124 .",
    "even more striking , it seems that the largest prime factors occurring grow only slowly ( namely approximately linearly ) when @xmath8 increases .",
    "the last fact strongly indicates that there may even be a closed form formula for @xmath125 .",
    "as it turns out , this is indeed the case . in the next section",
    "we will explicitly compute the determinant of an equivalent system of equations , from which it follows that ( see the remark after theorem  [ t2 ] ) @xmath126 hence we have the following theorem , which is the main theorem of our paper .",
    "[ t1 ] for all @xmath127 there is a formula @xmath128 where @xmath106 is a polynomial in @xmath3 of degree @xmath129 with rational coefficients .",
    "the polynomial @xmath106 can be found by solving the system of linear equations generated by and the ansatz and .",
    "the denominators of all @xmath102 s divide @xmath105 which is much smaller than @xmath130 .",
    "this means that there must be some miracle occurring at the end when solving the system .",
    "e.g. , when @xmath131 then @xmath132 has about @xmath133 digits but @xmath134 only @xmath135 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to offer an explanation for that .    in practice",
    "we are only interested in the coefficients of @xmath136 so we try to eliminate @xmath137 first .",
    "this can be done by first avoiding all equations containing @xmath138 , i.e. , the equations coming from the coefficients of @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "this looks very nice theoretically , in particular as the system for @xmath141 is triangular , but in practice the computer breaks down since the rational numbers occuring become very large .",
    "we close this section by listing a few explicit examples .",
    "we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144    we have @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147    we have @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150    ( nonsymmetric ) .",
    "we have @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153",
    "we want to prove that , by making the ansatz and and substituting this into the differential equation ( the polynomial @xmath93 being given by @xmath136 through  , @xmath91 being given by @xmath154 ) , the resulting system of linear equations will always have a solution .",
    "in fact , we aim at finding an explicit formula for the determinant of the corresponding matrix of coefficients that allows us to conclude that it can never vanish .",
    "it turns out that for that purpose it is more convenient to set up the system of linear equations in a different , but equivalent way .",
    "this equivalent system will have coefficient matrix @xmath155 ( see ) .",
    "the evaluation of its determinant will be accomplished through eqs .",
    ", , , , and theorem  [ t2 ] .    to be precise ,",
    "we encode the polynomial @xmath156 ( and , thus , @xmath71 and @xmath27 ) differently .",
    "we claim that @xmath71 has an expansion of the form @xmath157 subject to the single constraint @xmath158 ( as usual , empty poducts have to be interpreted as 1 . ) this is seen as follows .",
    "the polynomial @xmath156 can be written in the form @xmath159 for some coefficients @xmath160 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath161 in the last line , @xmath162 and @xmath163 have to be read as @xmath69 .",
    "it is now a trivial exercise to substitute the coefficients of @xmath164 in the sum in the last line into the left - hand side of and verify the truth of .",
    "now we are ready to set up the system of linear equations .",
    "we make again the ansatz , but we replace by @xmath167 where the @xmath168 , @xmath169 , are subject to ( i.e. , the relation holds when @xmath166 is replaced by @xmath168 ) . clearly , we have to add to the set of equations that result from the differential equation .",
    "the coefficient matrix of the system looks a follows : @xmath170 where @xmath28 is a line vector of @xmath171 zeroes , @xmath172 is the vector of coefficients of , i.e. , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is an @xmath177 matrix and @xmath178 is an @xmath179 matrix , both of which we define below .",
    "we consider the top - most line of @xmath155 ( which is formed out of @xmath28 and @xmath180 ) as row  0 of @xmath155 .",
    "we label the rows of @xmath176 and @xmath178 by @xmath35 running from @xmath70 to @xmath181 .",
    "furthermore , we label the columns of @xmath155 by @xmath182 running from @xmath70 to @xmath183 .    following this labelling scheme",
    ", the matrix @xmath176 has nonzero entries only in the four diagonals @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",
    "we denote the entries in column  @xmath182 on these four diagonals in order @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , where @xmath192 to be precise , the @xmath193-entry is @xmath188 , the @xmath194-entry is @xmath189 , the @xmath195-entry is @xmath190 , the @xmath196-entry is @xmath191 , @xmath197 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the matrix @xmath178 is composed out of columns , labelled @xmath198 , each of which containing just one nonzero entry . to be precise ,",
    "the nonzero entry of column @xmath199 is located in the @xmath200-st row ( according to our labelling scheme ) , and it is equal to @xmath201 , @xmath169 .",
    "we perform some row operations on @xmath155 , with the effect that the entries of @xmath180 get eliminated .",
    "this is achieved by subtracting @xmath202 times row  1 from row  0 , and @xmath203 times row @xmath204 from row  0 , @xmath205 .",
    "doing this , we must expect changes in row  0 in columns @xmath70 , @xmath129 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , ",
    ", @xmath209 .",
    "however , at this point a miracle occurs : the new entries in row  0 in columns @xmath204 , @xmath210 , are still 0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of the new entries in row  0 in columns @xmath211 , @xmath212 are @xmath213    after these manipulations we obtain a matrix of the form @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 have the same dimensions as before @xmath28 and @xmath180 , respectively , where the only nonzero entries of @xmath215 are in columns labelled by numbers which are divisible by @xmath129 , with the entry in column @xmath211 given by , and where @xmath216 consists only of zeroes .",
    "we have @xmath217    the next step consists in expanding the determinant of @xmath218 with respect to columns @xmath219 ( i.e. , the last @xmath220 columns ) .",
    "since each of these columns contains just one nonzero entry ( which is a power of @xmath221 ) , we have @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the matrix arising from @xmath218 by deleting the last @xmath220 columns and the rows @xmath204 , @xmath224 .",
    "more precisely , the matrix @xmath223 has the following form : @xmath225 where @xmath226 , @xmath212 , is a line vector with @xmath129 entries , all of them being zero except for the last , which is equal to , where @xmath227 is a line vector of @xmath228 zeroes , where @xmath229 and @xmath230 , @xmath212 , are @xmath231 matrices with nonzero entries only in the two main diagonals , and where @xmath232 and @xmath233 are @xmath234 matrices , @xmath233 being upper triangular . to be precise , for @xmath212 we have @xmath235 and @xmath236 and we have @xmath237",
    "the precise form of @xmath232 is without relevance for us .",
    "we do a laplace expansion with respect to the last @xmath228 rows . because of the triangular form of @xmath233 we obtain @xmath238 where @xmath239    instead of @xmath240 we consider a more general matrix .",
    "define the functions @xmath241 it should be noted that these functions specialize to @xmath242 , respectively , if @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "now we define the matrix @xmath245 by @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 clearly , we have @xmath249        once having found this theorem , it is not difficult to prove , by working out how the coefficients of @xmath258 resulting from the ansatz  are related to the coefficients of @xmath258 resulting from the ansatz . since this is not essential for the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] , we leave the details to the reader .",
    "first we show that @xmath259 divides @xmath250 , @xmath260 .",
    "what has to be proved is that @xmath250 vanishes for @xmath261 .",
    "this can be done by showing that for this choice of @xmath262 there is a nontrivial linear combination of the rows of @xmath245 . indeed , if @xmath263 we have @xmath264 as is easy to verify .",
    "next we claim that @xmath265 divides @xmath250 , @xmath266 .",
    "let us first impose the additional restriction that @xmath267 . using the above reasoning",
    ", the claim then follows from the fact that if @xmath268 we have @xmath269 as is again easy to verify . on the other hand , if @xmath270 , then the same argument shows that @xmath271 divides @xmath250 .",
    "it remains to be checked that also @xmath272 divides @xmath250 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath273 then we have @xmath274 whence @xmath272 divides @xmath250 for @xmath260 .      clearly , the degree in the @xmath262 s , @xmath275 s , and @xmath272 s of @xmath250 is at most @xmath276 .",
    "but the degree of the right - hand side of is exactly @xmath276 .",
    "therefore we have proved that @xmath277 where @xmath278 is a constant independent of the @xmath262 s , @xmath275 s , and @xmath272 s .    in order to determine @xmath278 , we compare coefficients of @xmath279 on both sides of .",
    "we claim that the coefficient of this monomial in @xmath250 is equal to @xmath280 , where @xmath281 is defined exactly in the same way as @xmath245 ( see ) , except that the definitions of the functions @xmath282 are replaced by [ eq : ck8 ] @xmath283 this is seen as follows .",
    "the monomial does not contain any @xmath275 .",
    "therefore , for finding its coefficient in @xmath250 , we may set @xmath284 in @xmath245 for all @xmath11 .    in which way may the monomial appear in @xmath250 ( with all @xmath275 equal to 0 ) ?",
    "a typical term in the expansion of @xmath250 is the product of @xmath285 entries of @xmath245 , each from a different row and column .",
    "the monomial contains @xmath286 .",
    "the variable @xmath287 is only found in columns @xmath204 , @xmath288 ( and rows labelled by numbers @xmath289 mod @xmath228 , according to our labelling scheme ) .",
    "therefore in a product of entries ( each from a different row and column ) which produces a term containing @xmath286 _ all _ the entries from columns @xmath204 must be ones containing @xmath287 .",
    "this explains the above definitions and of @xmath290 and @xmath291 , @xmath288 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we _ must _ generate the @xmath292 in from an entry in a column @xmath293 , for some @xmath294 .",
    "( the variable @xmath292 is also found in entries in columns @xmath204 , but these columns are already taken by our choice of entries which contain the @xmath287 s . ) this explains the definitions and of @xmath295 and @xmath296 , @xmath288 , respectively .",
    "next we ask how we can find ( in the remaining columns and rows ) entries which contain @xmath297 .",
    "arguing in an analogous manner , the variable @xmath298 only appears in columns @xmath293 , @xmath299 .",
    "one of these columns is already taken by the entry from which we picked @xmath292 . therefore in _ all _ the remaining ones we must choose entries containing @xmath298 .",
    "this explains the definitions and of @xmath300 and @xmath301 , @xmath288 , respectively .",
    "next we consider the term @xmath302 in .",
    "it must come from two entries in columns @xmath303 , for two different @xmath294 s .",
    "this explains the definitions and of @xmath304 and @xmath305 , @xmath288 , respectively .",
    "etc .",
    "we consider now a more general determinant than @xmath280 , the latter having been defined through the functions in .",
    "replace these functions by @xmath309 let us denote the matrix defined by these functions in the same way as before @xmath281 by @xmath310 .",
    "clearly , @xmath310 specializes to @xmath281 if all @xmath311 are set equal to 1 and all @xmath312 to @xmath313 .",
    "we proceed in a similar way as in the proof of theorem  [ t2 ] . in the first step",
    "we show that the product on the right - hand side of divides @xmath315 as a polynomial in the @xmath316 s and @xmath317 s .",
    "then , in the second step , we compare the degrees of the product and @xmath315 . since the degree of @xmath315 turns out to be at most the degree of the product , it then follows that @xmath315 is equal to the product times some constant which is independent of the @xmath311 s and @xmath312 s .",
    "finally , in the third step , this constant is found by computing the leading coefficient of @xmath315 .    .",
    "we start by applying several row and column operations to @xmath315 , with the final goal of reducing the size of the determinant .",
    "first , for @xmath318 , in this order , we add @xmath319 times row  @xmath35 to row @xmath320 .",
    "( it should be recalled that , according to our labelling scheme , we number the rows of @xmath310 from @xmath69 to @xmath276 . ) thus , we obtain the determinant of the following matrix : @xmath321 where the @xmath322 s , @xmath323 , are defined as earlier , and where the @xmath324 s and @xmath325 s , @xmath323 , are the @xmath231 matrices @xmath326 and @xmath327    next we  make \" the submatrices @xmath325 , @xmath323 , to diagonal matrices , by subtracting @xmath328 times column  @xmath182 from column @xmath329 , @xmath330 , @xmath331 times column  @xmath182 from column @xmath329 , @xmath332 ,  , and @xmath333 times column  @xmath182 from column @xmath329 , @xmath334 .",
    "after these operations we obtain the determinant of the matrix @xmath335 where @xmath336 and the @xmath337 s , @xmath338 , are the @xmath231 matrices @xmath339 and @xmath340 where @xmath341    now we eliminate the last columns in @xmath342 for @xmath343 .",
    "we start by eliminating the last column of @xmath344 .",
    "we do this by adding @xmath345 times column @xmath346 to column @xmath285 , @xmath347 .",
    "this makes all the entries in the last column which are in rows @xmath348 zero , whereas the entries in the last column in rows @xmath349 are modified .",
    "next we eliminate these entries in a similar fashion , by using the columns @xmath350 , @xmath347 , etc . in the end all the entries in the last column in rows @xmath351 will be zero , whereas the entries in the last column in rows @xmath352 will have been ( significantly ) modified .",
    "an analogous procedure is applied to eliminate the entries in the last columns of @xmath353 , @xmath354 .",
    "just to mention the first step : we add @xmath355 times column @xmath350 to column @xmath356 , @xmath347 .",
    "this makes all the entries in column @xmath356 which are in rows @xmath357 zero , whereas the entries in the last column in rows @xmath358 are modified .",
    "the advantage after having done all this is that now all the entries in columns @xmath211 , @xmath212 , are zero except for entries in rows @xmath359 .",
    "this fact , and the fact that the submatrices @xmath336 are diagonal matrices ( of rectangular form ) with last column consisting entirely of zeroes , makes it possible to reduce the determinant of the ( new ) matrix significantly . for @xmath360 we may expand the determinant with respect to row  @xmath35 , in this order . if the details are worked out , then we see that our original determinant @xmath315 is equal to @xmath361 where @xmath362 is given by , and where @xmath363 is given by @xmath364 clearly , we may extract @xmath365 from column  @xmath182 , @xmath366 , and@xmath367 from row  @xmath35 , @xmath368 ( still using our nonstandard labelling scheme where the rows are numbered @xmath359 ) , so that we obtain the expression @xmath369 where @xmath370 is given by @xmath371 and where @xmath372 is given by @xmath373 from it is abundantly clear that @xmath374 divides @xmath315 ( which , after all , is equal to ) .",
    "it remains to show that also @xmath375 divides @xmath315 .",

    "consequently , if @xmath398 then the entries in rows @xmath399 , @xmath405 ,  , @xmath228 are given by polynomials in @xmath182 ( to wit : @xmath182 denoting the column index of the entries ) of respective degrees @xmath403 ( ! ) , @xmath403 , @xmath406 , ",
    ", @xmath63 , @xmath70 .",
    "these are @xmath407 polynomials , all of degree at most @xmath403 .",
    "it follows that there must be a nontrivial linear combination of these polynomials that vanishes .",
    "hence , the rows @xmath399 , @xmath405 ,  , @xmath228 are linearly dependent , which , in turn , implies that the determinant in ( and , thus , also @xmath315 ) vanishes for @xmath398 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 .    . clearly , the degree of @xmath315 as a polynomial in the @xmath311 s and @xmath312 s is at most @xmath276 , whereas the degree of the product on the right - hand side of is exactly @xmath276 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath408 where @xmath409 is a constant independent of the @xmath311 s and @xmath312 s .    .",
    "in order to determine @xmath409 , we determine the coefficient of @xmath410 in the expansion of @xmath411 . by arguments similar to those at the end of the proof of theorem  [ t2 ] , it is seen that this coefficient is given by the determinant of the following matrix , which we denote by @xmath412 .",
    "it is defined exactly in the same way as @xmath245 ( see ) , except that the definitions of the functions @xmath282 are replaced by @xmath413 by expanding this determinant with respect to row  0 , we obtain @xmath414 where @xmath415 is , as earlier , given by , and @xmath416 is the matrix arising from @xmath412 by deleting row  0 and column @xmath417 .",
    "let @xmath418 , @xmath419 , be fixed .",
    "we will next compute @xmath420 .",
    "when we built @xmath416 from @xmath412 , we deleted in particular row  0",
    ". therefore we will now switch to the usual labelling scheme for rows and columns of a matrix , i.e. , we will subsequently not only label the columns by @xmath421 but also the rows .",
    "if @xmath422 , then we expand @xmath420 with respect to the last @xmath228 rows and then with respect to the last column .",
    "since these rows and this column contain only one nonzero entry , we obtain some multiple of the determinant of a @xmath423 matrix . if @xmath424 , then we continue by expanding the ( now reduced ) determinant with respect to the last @xmath425 rows and then with respect to the last 2 columns .",
    "we continue in the same manner until we have reduced @xmath420 to the determinant of a @xmath426 matrix , more precisely , until we arrive at @xmath427 where @xmath428 is the matrix @xmath429 with @xmath430 and @xmath336 the @xmath231 matrices @xmath431 and @xmath432 @xmath433 the @xmath434 matrix which arises from @xmath430 by deleting its last column , and @xmath176 the @xmath435 matrix @xmath436 we continue by expanding @xmath428 with respect to the last @xmath437 rows .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath438 for @xmath420 , where @xmath439 is the matrix @xmath440 with @xmath178 the @xmath441 matrix @xmath442    next we prepare for a reduction from the top of @xmath439 .",
    "we subtract 4 times column @xmath182 from column @xmath443 , @xmath444 , @xmath445 ,  , @xmath446 , in this order .",
    "thus @xmath447 is converted to @xmath448 , where @xmath449 is the matrix @xmath450 with @xmath451 and @xmath452 the @xmath231 matrices @xmath453 and @xmath454    our next goal is to  push \" the ( nonzero ) entries in columns @xmath455 , @xmath456 , down to rows @xmath457 .",
    "( this is similar to what we did in step  1 when we  pushed \" all the nonzero entries in columns @xmath458 , @xmath459 up to rows @xmath359 . ) in order to achieve this for the 1-st column , we add @xmath460 to column 1 . similarly , in order to achieve this for the @xmath461-st column , we add @xmath462 to column @xmath206 .",
    "etc . as a result ,",
    "the determinant @xmath448 is converted to the determinant of the matrix @xmath463 where @xmath451 and @xmath452 are as before , @xmath464 is the @xmath465 matrix @xmath466 and @xmath467 , @xmath468 , is a @xmath465 matrix with all entries equal to 0 , except for the entries in the first column . to be precise , the entry in the first column and row @xmath469 of @xmath467 is given by @xmath470",
    "it should be noted that the entries in the first column of @xmath452 ( @xmath452 appearing at the bottom of the matrix , as do the matrices @xmath467 ) is given by with @xmath471 .",
    "now everything is prepared for the reduction .",
    "we expand the determinant of with respect to rows @xmath472 .",
    "this reduces the determinant of to @xmath473 where @xmath474 is a @xmath434 matrix of the form @xmath475 with the @xmath476-entry of @xmath477 being given by , @xmath478 , @xmath479 , and @xmath178 the @xmath480 matrix from above .",
    "if we substitute all this in , we obtain that @xmath420 is equal to @xmath481 the submatrix @xmath178 of @xmath474 is almost diagonal .",
    "subtraction of 4 times row @xmath469 from row @xmath482 in @xmath474 , @xmath483 , will transform it into a completely diagonal matrix ( namely into the matrix on the right - hand side of with all entries @xmath484 replaced by 0 ) . as a side effect",
    ", this will turn the @xmath485-entry of @xmath474 into @xmath486 as is easily seen , the determinant of the in this way modified matrix , @xmath487 say , is @xmath488 or , explicitly , @xmath489 substitution of the above in yields that the determinant @xmath420 is equal to @xmath490    now we substitute this in .",
    "we obtain that @xmath491 is equal to @xmath492 the sum is readily evaluated by means of the chu",
    " vandermonde summation ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.1 , ( 5.27 ) ) ) , so that we obtain @xmath493 since the coefficient of @xmath410 in the expression on the right - hand side of is exactly the same , we have completed the proof of the lemma ."
