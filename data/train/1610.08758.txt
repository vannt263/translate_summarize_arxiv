    "the most recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from the planck satellite  @xcite are in excellent agreement with the assumption of adiabatic primordial scalar perturbation with a nearly gaussian and quasi - invariant primordial power spectrum . at the same time , the observations support the standard cosmological inflation  @xcite and the accuracy of the current data provides narrow constraints on cosmological parameters , ruling out large classes of models ( e.g. those predicting a large tensor - to - scalar ratio , or large non - gaussianities are currently discarded ) .",
    "several inflationary primordial potentials are in agreement with data and many other can be reconciled with the observations when the dynamics involved during inflation go beyond the simplest traditional cold inflation ( ci ) scenario .",
    "this is the case of the warm inflation ( wi ) picture  @xcite where the presence of nontrivial dynamics , accounting for both dissipative and related stochastic effects , cause valuable changes on the usual observational quantities like in the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath1 , the spectral index , @xmath2 , and the non - gaussianity parameter , @xmath3 ( for a representative list of recent references see refs .",

    ", some classes of inflaton potentials excluded in the ci context by the data can be rehabilitated in the wi context , as the monomial chaotic potential @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the ci and the wi pictures show several peculiar differences that lead to the above mentioned predictions .",
    "for instance , in ci the dynamics is assumed independent from the coupling of the inflaton field @xmath5 with other fields .",
    "however , the inflaton interaction with other field degrees of freedom become relevant at the end of inflation , at the time of ( pre)reheating , where the energy density stored in the inflaton is released in radiation form through decay processes ( reheating ) and/or complex nonlinear dynamics ( preheating ) .",
    "in contrast with this picture , in the wi scenario the coupling between the inflaton and other fields might be strong enough to lead to a non - negligible radiation production rate , yet preserving the required flatness of the inflaton potential . the radiation production during wi can be sufficient enough to compensate the typical supercooling observed in ci , thus bringing to a non - isentropic inflationary expansion , and can effectively produce a quasi - equilibrium thermal radiation bath , leading to a smooth transition from the inflationary accelerated expansion to the radiation phase ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "dissipative and stochastic processes typically involved in the wi dynamics  @xcite are able to produce a strongly modified dynamics , both at the background and the fluctuations levels , leading to many distinguished predictions with respect to the ci scenario . in particular ,",
    "in wi the primary source of density fluctuations comes from thermal fluctuations originated in the radiation bath and transported to the inflaton field as adiabatic curvature perturbations  @xcite , while in ci the density perturbations are due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field  @xcite .    in wi ,",
    "the background and the inflaton fluctuations dynamics are modified due to an extra friction term @xmath6 , that accounts for the energy transfer between the inflaton and the radiation .",
    "the specific form for the dissipation coefficient @xmath7 depends on the model building details , as the field interactions and the parameters regime .",
    "a particular form of dissipation coefficient , highly studied in the literature  @xcite , shows a cubic dependence with the thermal radiation bath temperature , @xmath8 .",
    "other forms , obtained depending on the scheme and the interactions form of the inflaton field with other field degrees of freedom , are also possible .",
    "for instance , the form @xmath9 , was mainly considered in the first works of wi . however , the dynamical regime where this type of dissipation coefficient emerges proved to be troublesome , since it happens in a regime where large thermal corrections can be produced , affecting the inflaton potential and precluding wi from happening in the simplest models  @xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a realization of wi for a specific model in this regime ) .",
    "recently , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that an inflation model making use of the collective symmetry breaking of the little higgs type of models  @xcite , that leads to a dissipation coefficient @xmath10 , can resolve the objections posed in the earlier references  @xcite and resulting in a successful wi realization .    in this work",
    "we provide an extended analysis on the predictions of the two successful dissipation forms in wi @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "we focus on key parameters like @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as the running of the spectral index @xmath11 and the running of the running @xmath0 , and we also give results for the tensor spectral index @xmath12 . to our knowledge , this is the first work that studies predictions and constraints in wi of the running of the running .",
    "this parameter has recently attracted increasing attention  @xcite due to the planck results hinting on a rather larger and positive value for @xmath0 at @xmath13-confidence level ( cl )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , while standard ci models can only predict a very small and _ negative _ @xmath0 , here we show that wi can lead to a _ positive _ @xmath0 , depending of the inflaton potential and dissipative regime .",
    "we achieve our predictions studying a variety of representative potentials for the inflaton , covering both large and small field models , extending earlier works that made use primarily of the chaotic quartic and hilltop type of inflaton potentials .",
    "we finally perform a statistical analysis for these inflationary models in the considered dissipation regimes , providing the most up - to - date analysis for the wi .",
    "our results provide the essential link between the ( many ) aspects studied in the literature and the precise measurements of the cmb radiation anisotropies .",
    "furthermore , our results place a greater demand not only on better constrain the existing wi models , but also on future model building .",

    "for instance , most of the wi models make use of a structure of interactions such that the inflaton is coupled to heavy intermediate fields , that are in turn coupled to light radiation fields .",
    "as the inflaton slowly moves according to its potential , it can trigger the decay of these heavy intermediate fields into the light radiation fields and generates a dissipation term for the inflaton  @xcite . in this case , the resulting dissipation coefficient can be well described by the expression  @xcite    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the interactions specifics .",
    "hereafter we refer to the above @xmath31 as the _ cubic dissipation coefficient_. this is obtained in the so - called _ low temperature _ regime for wi  @xcite , where the inflaton only couples to the heavy intermediate fields , whose masses are larger than the radiation temperature and , thus , the inflaton gets decoupled from the radiation fields .",
    "for the cubic dissipation coefficient we can find explicit expressions for the evolutions of @xmath19 , @xmath32 and @xmath5 as a function of the number of e - folds @xmath33 and in the slow - roll approximation , given by  @xcite    @xmath34    where we have defined @xmath35 .",
    "more recently , it was realized another mechanism able to lead to a successful wi regime  @xcite , based on a collective symmetry where the inflaton is a pseudo - goldstone boson . in this case",
    "the inflaton can be directly coupled to the radiation fields and gets protection from the large potential thermal corrections due to the symmetries obeyed by the model .",
    "the resulting dissipative coefficient , here obtained in the _ large temperature _ regime ( where the fields coupled to the inflaton are light with respect to the ambient temperature ) , is given simply by  @xcite    @xmath36    hereafter we refer to the above equation as the _ linear dissipation coefficient_. also in this case , we can find analogous expressions of eqs .",

    "the tensor modes are not affected by the dissipative dynamics and @xmath63 remains unaltered from the ci result  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the dissipative and thermal effects modify the scalar power spectrum through the enhancement term @xmath64 , producing a decrease of the tensor - to - scalar ratio value in wi .",
    "looking at the latest planck results , we quote the @xmath65cdm model constraint of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 cl ) using planck tt+lowp data  @xcite . for the extended model @xmath65cdm@xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 ( @xmath70 cl ) when the planck tt+lowp dataset is combined with bicep / keck array data  @xcite at the pivot scale @xmath71 .    considering a @xmath65cdm@xmath72 model , with the running of the scalar index ,    @xmath73    the data prefers a tiny negative value @xmath74 ( @xmath67 cl , tt+lowp ) , with a small improvement of the maximum likelihood with respect to a powel - law spectrum ( @xmath75 )  @xcite . the data give also the possibility of a small running of the running ,    @xmath76    and in this case , at @xmath67 cl using the tt+lowp data , the values obtained for a @xmath65cdm@xmath77 model are    @xmath78    which seems to produce a better fit to the temperature spectrum at low multipoles according to the planck results , such that @xmath79  @xcite .",

    "the purpose of this work is to give a clear overview of the effects of the two wi dissipation forms considered in the previous section on the inflationary observables , as well as their statistical significance when compared with current cmb data . to get a more complete study , we select several representative classes of primordial potentials , namely :    1 .   _",

    "both the chaotic potentials ( quartic and sextic ) are representative examples of large field models , and the quartic potential is a typical prototype potential used in many renormalizable scalar field theories . while in the ci picture these are examples of potentials unfavorable by the planck data  @xcite , they can be rehabilitated in the context of wi  @xcite .",
    "instead , potentials like the hilltop , the higgs and the plateau ones are typical examples of small field models of inflation and are found to be in agreement with the planck data in both cold and warm inflation pictures  @xcite .    in order to produce @xmath2 predictions compatible with the latest cmb data for a wider range of @xmath88 variation , we choose different setting values for the arbitrary parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "we follow the same idea to choose the @xmath86 value of the hilltop potential , depending on the type of dissipation coefficient .",

    "this is why , for example , the simple chaotic quartic or sextic potentials , which are discarded in the ci picture for their large tensor - to - scalar prediction , can be again in accordance with the observational data in the wi case .",
    "we also note that the results obtained for the linear dissipation coefficient allow a larger range for @xmath88 in both the chaotic potentials , while for the hilltop and higgs potentials we have an opposite behavior .    in fig .",

    "the behaviours seen for @xmath0 are very peculiar , since the results given by the ci single field models , as well as non - interacting multifield inflaton models , are naturally not capable of explaining a positive running of the running .",

    "the latter is assumed as reference since , as we have already mentioned above , for these wi models the running of the running @xmath0 is too small and the data accuracy is not enough to detect the tiny signal .",
    "the incompatibility to satisfy both the observables causes the worse @xmath124 . at the same time",
    "we note that there are values of @xmath88 , for all the other potentials , that allow combinations of the @xmath2 and its higher order parameters such that all the current observations are fulfilled . finally , in fig .  [ chi2_q ]",
    "we can see that the significantly different behavior between the cubic and linear dissipation cases is reflected in a further preference for higher values of @xmath88 in the latter for all the models , except for the hilltop and higgs models .",
    "the differences between the best fit temperature power spectrum of our analysis and the minimal @xmath65cdm model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : best - fit_tt ] . here , the best fit wi models are very close to the minimal @xmath65cdm predictions , with slightly different amplitude with respect to the simplest power - law potential .",
    "our work shows that these slight variations are too small to be appreciated by the current observations with a @xmath116 statistical analysis . at the same time",
    ", the data well constrain the observables determined by the dissipation ratio value and we obtained the first estimate of how @xmath88 affects the anisotropy temperature spectra .",
    "also , we can comment that the two dissipation coefficient forms considered do not produce specific features in the spectrum .",
    "as already mentioned , we want to stress that as our wi parameterization takes into account one degree of freedom less than the @xmath65cdm model and ensures a best fit @xmath127 .    finally , it is interesting to quote the current best fit value , in the ci context , of several inflaton potentials we have analyzed  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the chaotic quartic potential model it was estimated @xmath128 with respect to the @xmath65cdm model ; for the hilltop potential @xmath129 and for the higgs potential @xmath130 .",
    "these values can be compared with the @xmath124 values shown in the tab .",
    "[ tab : models ] , or in figs  [ chi2_ns ] and [ chi2_q ] .",
    "then , our analysis gives a good indication of how the wi picture reconciles the different inflaton potentials considered , producing observables in agreement with the data .",
    "in this work we performed extended analysis of several representative inflaton potentials in a warm inflation scenario , covering both large and small field models . we obtain our results studying two different dissipation regimes , namely with the dissipation coefficient showing a cubic and linear dependence with the temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "the dynamics leading to the dissipation coefficient with a cubic form emerges in what is usually referred as the _ low temperature _ regime of wi , where the inflaton is coupled to heavy intermediate fields that are in turn coupled to light radiation fields .",
    "the decay of the heavy intermediate fields into the light radiation fields produces the cubic dependence of the dissipation coefficient .",
    "the second dissipation regime we have considered is known in the literature as the _ high temperature _ regime of wi . here",
    "the inflaton field directly couples to the radiation fields , yet preventing large thermal and radiative corrections to the inflaton potential , as a consequence of a collective symmetry breaking in the model construction .",
    "this leads to a dissipation coefficient that is linear in the temperature  @xcite .",
    "we achieve a parameterization of the primordial power spectrum able to take into account higher order effects as the running and the running of the running , and we analyze the observational predictions of the considered models in the two dissipation regimes described above . we show that the tensor modes are not affected by the dissipative dynamics , while the scalar spectra is modified by an additional enhancement term . hence , the dissipation ratio @xmath88 shows a significant impact on the spectral index @xmath2 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 .",
    "it can reconcile the parameters value with the observation , i.e. , a non detection of primordial gravity waves might be a hint of wi in the high dissipative regime ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "in other words , a change of @xmath88 allows a larger range of cosmological parameter values to enter in accordance with the planck results .",
    "this degeneracy can in principle be broken combining these results with the constraints on the other observables .",
    "other way is to study the non - gaussianities , since in wi these have distinct features when compared with the ci picture  @xcite .",
    "we can also distinguish the regimes of weak dissipation @xmath132 , with those of strong dissipation @xmath133 through different shapes , unique to wi ( for details , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "intriguing , our studies show that both the running @xmath11 and the running of the running @xmath0 assume negative or positive values depending on @xmath88 .",
    "these behaviors are in contrast with the ci results , where only negative values for @xmath11 and @xmath0 are predicted .",
    "the wi picture is demonstrating a better versatility , where the parameter @xmath88 ( or , equivalently , the temperature of the thermal bath present during the wi dynamics ) is the key parameter , and can achieve values able to better explain the current data .",
    "we compared the predictions with the most up - to - date cmb data and we performed a statistical analysis to constrain the dissipative effects .",
    "the data well constrain the observables determined by the dissipation ratio value , and we get the first estimate of how @xmath88 affects the anisotropy temperature power spectrum .",
    "our results show the agreement between the wi picture with the planck release , rehabilitating several forms of primordial potentials ruled out by the data in the ci context . at the same time , our analysis show that the chaotic sextic model is unable to describe the current data , since there is not a value of @xmath88 that is able to satisfy simultaneously the values required for the spectral index and its running . despite the values for @xmath0 obtained for all the models are still to small to be of relevance , we note that its magnitude tends to increase with the gain in dissipation value .",
    "it is a feature that can eventually be explored in future model building in wi . at the same time , the current constraints on the higher order parameters are still too wide , improvements in the data are need to update our results .",
