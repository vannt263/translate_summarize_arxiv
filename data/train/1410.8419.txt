    "since about 60 years the dynamics of opinions has been studied .",
    "today it is a standard topic of general conferences on agent - based modelling .",
    "a bunch of models were defined and analyzed . in the last 15 years",
    "at least hundreds and probably more than thousands of simulation studies on the dynamics of opinions were published .",
    "we give specific hints to the related opinion dynamics literature that is directly relevant in the context of our present article . ] the studies and their underlying models differ in many details : the opinions and the underlying time are continuous or discrete , the updating of opinions is governed by different updating regimes , the space of possible opinions may have more than one dimension , the dynamics may run on this or that type of network , various types of noise may be involved .",
    "but despite of all their differences there is a commonality in all these studies and their models : the agents influence mutually their opinions , _ but they do not do that strategically_.    what is studied in the huge body of articles is typically focusing on convergence , dynamical patterns or final structures . given the specific parameters of the underlying model , the typical questions are : under what conditions does the dynamics stabilize ? does the dynamics lead to consensus , polarisation , or other interesting types of clustering ?",
    "what are the time scales that are involved ?",
    "what remains unasked in these studies are strategic questions like : which opinion should an agent pretend to have to drive the whole dynamics in his or her preferred direction ?",
    "where in the opinion space should an agent ` place ' an opinion , given that he or she has a certain preference with regard to the opinions in later periods .",
    "our article deals with such strategic questions .",
    "we develop a conceptual framework that allows to answer strategic questions in certain cases .",
    "additionally , we analyze why it is surprisingly difficult or impossible to give exact answers to strategic questions even in cases that look very , very simple .",
    "it is not by accident that strategic questions are normally not raised in the sort of research that is labeled opinion dynamics .",
    "the standard approach is to describe the dynamics as a more or less complicated dynamical system : there is a set @xmath0 of agents @xmath1 and a discrete time @xmath2 .",
    "the opinions of the agents are given by an _",
    "opinion profile_. this is a vector @xmath3 that describes the state of the system at time  @xmath4 . even if stated in an informal or semi - formal way ( sufficiently clear to program the process ) , the dynamics of the system is basically given by a function @xmath5 that computes the state of the system @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for each agent @xmath8 the function @xmath5 specifies how @xmath9 depends upon @xmath10 .",
    "depending upon the specific opinion dynamics model , the vector valued functions @xmath5 work in very different ways .",
    "for the most part they do some kind of averaging : averaging with a privileged weight for agent @xmath8 s own opinion or a weighted averaging with weights @xmath11 that agent @xmath8 assigns to agents  @xmath12 and that are meant to express agent  @xmath8 s respect for agent  @xmath12 , or some other sort of averaging subject to constraints , for instance constraints in terms of network distance on an underlying network on which the opinions dynamics is assumed to run .",
    "whatever the ` story ' about @xmath5 , it is always a reactive process in which the agents react on the _ last _ period @xmath4 . in principle",
    "the step to @xmath13 might depend upon some more past periods .",
    "but even then , an answer to the question , where to place an opinion in order to drive the dynamics in a preferred direction , requires something very different from looking into the past : it requires _ anticipation _ , i.e. , finding out what the future effects of placing an opinion here or there in the opinion space probably are , and then placing it there , where the placement is most effective to get to a preferred outcome .    in the following ,",
    "we assume a setting in which we have two sets of agents : first , a set of _ non - strategic _ agents as they are usually assumed in opinion dynamics .",
    "they are driven by the function @xmath5 .",
    "the function describes a dynamical system in which the non - strategic agents always reveal their ` true ' actual opinion , take the opinions of others as their true actual opinion , and mutually react on the given opinion profile @xmath10 according to @xmath14 .",
    "the second set of agents is a set of _ strategic _ agents .",
    "whatever their true opinion may actually be , they can place any opinion strategically in the opinion space where , then , non - strategic agents take these opinions at their face values and consider them as revealed true opinions of other agents .",
    "the strategic agents have preferences over possible opinion profiles of non - strategic agents .",
    "therefore , they try to place opinions in such a way that the opinion stream that is generated by @xmath5 is driven towards the preferred type of profile .",
    "our setting has a structure as it is often perceived or even explicitly ` conceptualized ' by political or commercial campaigners : there is an ongoing opinion stream , result of and driven by mutual exchange of opinions between communicating citizens , consumers , members of some parliamentary body , etc . that opinion stream has its own dynamics",
    "however , it is possible to intervene : using channels of all sorts ( tv , radio , print media , mails , posters , adds , calls , speeches , personal conversation , etc . )",
    "one can place opinions in the opinion space .",
    "done in an intelligent way , these interventions should drive the opinion stream in the direction of an outcome that is preferred by the principal who pays a campaign . about that will often be the self - understanding and selling - point of a campaigning agency .",
    "the number of strategic agents matters : if there are _ two or more _ strategic agents , the setting becomes a _ game theoretical context _ in which the strategic agents have to take into account that there are others that try to influence the opinion dynamics _ as well_. therefore , the strategic agents do not only ` play a game ' with the non - strategic agents .",
    "they play also  and that now in an exact game theoretical sense of the word  a _ game _ against each other .",
    "it is a complicated game for which in principle usual solution concepts like the ( sub - game perfect ) nash equilibrium can be applied .",
    "but if there is _ just one _ strategic agent , then there are no other competing players . that turns the problem of the strategic agent into the following question : how can one place opinions in an ongoing opinion stream ( governed by  @xmath5 ) in such a way that the stream moves as much as possible in the direction of one s favorite profile ?",
    "this task means to optimize of decisions over time . technically speaking , problems of this type are _ optimal control problems_. as soon as a mathematical formalization is available",
    ", there are various mathematical methods to find solutions .",
    "the topic of this paper is the optimal control problem of a strategic agent who tries to influence a certain ongoing opinion dynamics . as a benchmark problem for such an agent",
    ", we define what we call the _ campaign problem _ : the strategic agent tries to control an opinion dynamics , such that in a certain period , known in advance , there are as much as possible opinions of normal agents in a certain interval of the opinion space . that covers many types of voting or buying campaigns",
    ". we will investigate the campaign problem by various methods .",
    "our focus will always be on understanding basic features of the problem  and that will be difficult enough .",
    "some elementary mathematical proofs will give some theoretical insights into structural properties . with models from mixed - integer linear programming ( milp )",
    "we will try to directly solve our central optimization problem . this way we can solve some instances of the campaign problem , but ",
    "surprisingly  not all .",
    "therefore we will additionally attack the control problem by heuristic methods .",
    "an additional investigation using genetic algorithms provides evidence for the fact that ` good ' controls are almost impossible to find by randomized exploration .",
    "our question and approach immediately raises moral and political concerns : over the last years we learnt that there are well equipped agencies that ( among other things ) aim at a more or less complete supervision of private and public opinions .",
    "is nt the title of our paper at least a partial confession , that now , as a kind of additional thread , basic research on strategies for an efficient manipulation of public opinion formation is put on the agenda , is nt our ` control terminology ' a tell - tale language ?",
    "this is a very serious question and a very serious concern .",
    "an answer requires careful consideration of least six aspects : _ first _ , the only means of opinion ` control ' is publically stating an opinion . _ second _ , campaigning can be done for both , good and bad purposes : information , enlightenment , spreading the truth , _ or _",
    "desinformation , confusion , spreading liars .",
    "_ third _ , whoever plans a campaign for a good purpose will immediately get into serious optimization problems .",
    "for an example , let s assume that measles vaccination is basically a good thing . from a public health point of view , a certain minimum vaccination rate is necessary and a certain upper rate sufficient . in the us , germany , and other countries",
    "the actual vaccination rates are too low . therefore public health institutions design pro vaccination campaigns . in doing so , important questions are : on which parts of the networks of vaccination skeptics and enemies should one concentrate to what degree , or in what sequence ? what might convince which parts of the networks to change their opinions ?",
    "which opinion changes can be induced in the network ?  all these questions are questions about an optimal campaign , given one s constraints ( in terms of budget , time , channels , arguments , their effects on whom , and chances to confront people with them etc . ) .",
    "_ fourth _ , our control terminology is the usual terminology in the disciplines , theories , and tool box approaches that can be used to solve optimization problems of all sorts .",
    "our campaign problem is just an instance .",
    "the spirit of these approaches is technical : one has some constrained means to influence something to some degree in a certain , more or less attractive direction .",
    "what , then , is an optimal use of one s means ? that is the guiding question .",
    "the question is neutral as to ends , except for optimality itself ( and some more formal consistency requirements ) .",
    "the possibility of a ` dual use ' is inherent to such approaches . _",
    "fifth _ , in what follows our strategic agents place their opinions independent of any truth considerations .",
    "they try to influence the ongoing opinion dynamics in their favorite direction by placing an opinion here or there in the opinion space . only the effects matter .",
    "therefore , one might say , our strategic agents are completely opportunistic . under a less pejorative description",
    "we might consider them as perfect diplomats that know how to overcome entrenched opinions .",
    "if we consider diplomacy or opportunism as morally unacceptable , then we could formulate a corresponding _ moral _ constraint : we could require to place only opinions that are close to one s true actual opinion , and we specify ` close ' by a certain threshold for the maximal acceptable distance of placed opinions to one s own actual opinion .",
    "probably nobody would advocate a threshold of zero .",
    "but , then , one should also recognize , that for any such _ non_-zero - threshold , there still exists the control problem of how to design an optimal campaign ( though with an additional constraint ) .",
    "_ finally _ , dual use concerns about an optimal control approach to opinion dynamics are justified , of course .",
    "the existence of professional disinformation agencies is not an invention of conspiracy theorists .",
    "they are at work , they have their _ secret _ expertise  and , in all likelihood , they learn . but exactly because of that there has to be _ public _ knowledge about what can be done in terms of optimal campaigning  and that for both , good _ and _ bad purposes .",
    "the first type of knowledge is supportive , the second protective .",
    "helpful are both .      to specify the campaign problem",
    "we add _ just one _ strategic agent@xmath15 to the set of agents .",
    "agent@xmath15 is equipped with the ability to freely choose in any time step what other agents then perceive as his or her opinion .",
    "we call agent@xmath15 the _ controller _ and his freely chosen opinion the _ control_. mathematically , this makes the development of the opinion system dependent on exogenously chosen parameters , namely the control opinion , and we are faced with a _ control system_. if we define what the controller wants to achieve , we can formulate an _ optimal control problem _ , for which the controller tries to find the controls to get there .",
    "our optimal control problem is of a _ specific  seemingly simple  type _ : agent@xmath15 can strategically place opinions in a finite sequence of periods , one and only one opinion per period .",
    "there is the ongoing and underlying opinion dynamics , given by a function @xmath5 .",
    "period by period agent@xmath15 tries to do the placement of an opinion in such a way that finally in a certain future time step  @xmath16 ( the _ horizon _ ) , known in advance , something is maximized : the number of normal agents opinions that are in a certain part of the opinion space that ex ante was specified by agent@xmath15 . to keep it simple , we assume as a special one - dimensional opinion space the real - valued unit interval @xmath17 $ ] . as the part of the opinion space preferred by the controller , we assume a _ target interval _ @xmath18",
    "\\subseteq [ 0 , 1]$ ] for some prescribed @xmath19 in @xmath20 $ ] known to the controller .",
    "both assumptions are much less restrictive than they seem to be : first , the unit interval can be used to represent opinions about , for example , tax rates , minimal wages , maximum salaries , political positions on a left - right spectrum , product quality , or any property whatsoever that can be expressed by real - valued numbers . if  and often that will be the case  the ` really ' possible range of numerical values is different from the unit interval , then some transformation , approximation , or range regarding guess work is necessary .",
    "but that is an easy and widely accepted step ( at least in principle ) .",
    "second , suppose there are @xmath21 fixed alternatives @xmath22^m$ ] , sorted such that @xmath23 .",
    "further suppose , our @xmath24 normal agents have to choose among the alternatives at the future time step  @xmath16 and and will do that by choosing an alternative that is next to their own opinion in that time step .",
    "what , then , is the problem of a controller with the interest to make as much normal agents as possible choosing a certain alternative  @xmath25 ? obviously the problem is to maximize the number of agents opinions that in time step  @xmath16 are within a certain interval to the left and to the right of the favored alternative  @xmath25 .",
    "the exact bounds of that interval depend upon the exact positions of the two nearest alternatives  @xmath26 to the left and  @xmath27 to the right of the favored  @xmath25 .",
    "the exact left and rights bounds are then @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "therefore , whatever the vector of alternatives may be ( e.g. , positions of parties or candidates on a left / right scale , a price or a technical specification of a certain type of product ) , whenever there are voting or buying decisions of alternatives . ] after a foregoing opinion dynamics ( e.g. , about the appropriate position in the political spectrum , the acceptable price or a desirable technical specification of some product ) , our controller agent@xmath15 who tries to ` sell ' a certain alternative @xmath25 as effectively as possible , has always the same problem : how to get by period @xmath16 as many opinions as possible within a certain target interval @xmath18 $ ] , determined by the closest left and right competitors of  @xmath25 ?",
    " obviously , our framework and setup is much more general than it looks at a first glance .",
    "our problem and approach presupposes an underlying opinion dynamics given by a function  @xmath5 .",
    "but there are many .",
    "we will use a linear and a non - linear variant , each of them probably being the most prominent variant of their type .    in the _ linear variant _ , the opinion dynamics is driven by _ weighted averaging _ : weights @xmath11 may express the respect or competence that an agent  @xmath8 assigns to an agent  @xmath12 ; alternatively , a weight @xmath11 may express the influence , impact or power that agent  @xmath12 has on agent  @xmath8 .",
    "the weights that an agent assigns sum up to one .",
    "the opinion space is the unit interval @xmath17 $ ] . ",
    "the history of this linear system goes back to @xcite , it has been already presented by @xcite , it was explicitly stated by @xcite , and it received a lot of attention , especially in philosophy , through the book by @xcite . and based on constant weights .",
    "it is shown that for lots of weight matrices the individuals reach a consensus whatever the initial opinions might be  if they only were willing to apply the proposed aggregation procedure . '' ] we will refer to that model as the _ degroot - model _",
    "( dg - model ) .    the _ non - linear variant _ that we will use is the so called _ bounded confidence model _ ( bc - model ) . in this model",
    "the agents take seriously those others whose opinion are not too far away from their own opinion : the agents have a certain confidence radius  @xmath30 and update their opinions ",
    "the opinion space is again the unit interval @xmath17 $ ]  by averaging over all opinions that are from their own opinion not further away than  @xmath30 : an agent  @xmath8 updates to @xmath31 by averaging over the elements of the set @xmath32 , i.e. , over all the opinions that are within what is called his or her confidence interval .",
    "the model was defined by @xcite , in 1998 it was coined _ bounded confidence model _",
    "@xcite , and then for the first time , to a certain extent , comprehensively analyzed , by both simulations and rigorous analytical means , by @xcite .",
    "the model looks extremely simple .",
    "however , there are several warnings in the literature on the bc - model , among them a very recent one : `` the update rule  is certainly simple to formulate , though the simplicity is deceptive '' @xcite .",
    "the authors warning is well founded : the simple update rule generates a complicated dynamics that still is only partially understood . the main reason for that is this : the updating rule of the bc - model can be described as assigning weights to other agents .",
    "all agents with opinions out of the confidence interval get a weight of  @xmath33 ; agents within get a weight of  @xmath34 divided by the number of agents that are within the interval . therefore , the bc - dynamics is weighted averaging as well",
    ". however , there is a crucial difference to the linear dg - model : the weights of the bc - model are _ time - dependent _ and , even worse , _ discontinuously dependent on the current profile_. that causes a lot of trouble  and , at the same time , generates many of interesting effects . as a consequence ,",
    "the bc - model became a subject for all sorts of analytical or computational analysis and a starting point for extensions of all sorts .",
    "the body of literature on the bc - model is correspondingly huge .",
    "structural results in the bc - model were obtained with respect to convergence and its rate @xcite , thresholds for the confidence radius @xcite , the identification of the really crucial topological and metric structures @xcite , or the influence of the underlying network @xcite .",
    "the influence of a ` true ' opinion , to which ( some of ) the individuals are attracted , received special attention @xcite . with a grain of salt ,",
    "the true opinion can also be interpreted as a control that is constant over time and that is contained in each individual s confidence interval .",
    "many variants of the original bc - model ( discrete time , finitely many individuals , continuous opinion space ) have been proposed , among them pairwise sequential updating @xcite , a discrete opinion space @xcite , a multi - dimensional opinion space @xcite , a noisy opinion space @xcite , a continuous distribution instead of a finite - dimensional vector of opinions @xcite , continuous time @xcite , and a continuum of agents @xcite .",
    "alternative dynamics have been enhanced with bc - type features by several authors @xcite in order to make the resulting emergent effects more interesting .",
    "it is interesting to note that simulations play an important role in the investigation of the innocent - looking models for opinion dynamics @xcite  a hint that some aspects of opinion dynamics are very hard to deduce purely theoretically .",
    "the arguably most general account of theoretical aspects was contributed by chazelle on the basis of a completely new methodology around function theoretical arguments @xcite .",
    "moreover , opinion dynamics in multi - agent systems can be seen as an instance of _ influence system _  this broader context is also described by  @xcite .    @xcite study the influence of a given , fixed exogenous propaganda opinion on the deffuant - weisbuch opinion dynamics .",
    "however , the problem of optimally choosing a propaganda opinion is not considered .",
    "implicitly , the control of opinion dynamics started out from gaining control over the communication structure @xcite or additional system parameters @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of time - varying exogenous influences on the consensus process has been studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated how the time to stabilization changes if controlled opinions enter the scene .",
    "for the first time to the best of our knowledge , the notion of opinion control appeared literally only in the title of a paper by @xcite , based on a different dynamical model , though . for continuous time",
    "optimal control techniques have been applied to opinion consensus , exemplarily also for the bc - dynamics , in the preprint by @xcite .",
    "closest to our research is , up to now , probably the investigation by @xcite about so - called damage spreading : what happens if some of the opinions in a bc - model change erratically and possibly drastically ?",
    "the setting in that paper , however , has not been utilized to find in some sense ` optimal damages ' , i.e. , some that lead to an outcome that is most desirable among all possible outcomes .      in what follows",
    ", we analyze our optimal control problem with the linear dg- and the non - linear bc - model as the underlying opinion dynamics that agent@xmath15 tries to control : given the dg- or bc - dynamics and using the controls , i.e. , placing one opinion per period here or there in the opinion space , agent@xmath15 tries to maximize the number of agents with opinions that in a future period  @xmath16 are in a certain target interval @xmath18 $ ]  and therefore would ` buy ' the corresponding alternative @xmath25 that agent@xmath15 is actually campaigning for .  in the following , we will switch to a more vivid language fitting this interpretation : agents are called _ voters _ , the special agent@xmath15 is called the _ controller _ , the target interval @xmath18 $ ] is called the _ conviction interval _ , and voters in the target interval are called _",
    "convinced voters_.    as an example , we will analyze a specific instance of the campaign problem : there are @xmath35 voters , governed by a dg- or bc - version of the ( reactive ) function @xmath5 . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the @xmath35 voters start with the opinions @xmath33 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ,  , @xmath39 , @xmath34 .",
    "the confidence radius is given by @xmath40 and the conviction interval is @xmath41 $ ]",
    ". that conviction interval would be the target in a campaign in which the alternatives @xmath42 are competing and @xmath43 is the preferred alternative . the goal is to maximize the number of convinced voters , i.e. , those with opinions in the conviction interval , in a certain future period @xmath16 with @xmath44 .",
    "the benchmark problem looks like a baby problem .",
    "but it is a monster : it will turn out that for higher one digit values of @xmath16 we could not solve it by the most sophisticated methods available .",
    "more specifically , we will see , that even for this innocent - looking example we were not able to find the optimal number of convinced voters for all numbers of stages between @xmath34 and  @xmath45 . in table",
    "[ tab : allresults ] we summarize our results on the benchmark campaign problem in this paper . in the rest of the paper we will explain in detail how we obtained that knowledge .",
    ".the optimal number of convinced voters in the benchmark example lies between the given lower and upper bounds , depending on the number of stages ; we will explain in in sections  [ sec : heuristics]@xmath46 and  [ sec : computational - info]@xmath47 how we obtained this information .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ]     table  [ tab : milp - cplex - parameters ] shows the cplex parameter setting that we used for our computations .",
