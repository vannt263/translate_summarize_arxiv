    "the theory of second order phase transitions is based on the assumption that at temperatures close to the critical temperature @xmath6 there is only one dominating length scale associated with the critical behavior of the system , the correlation length . since the correlation length diverges as the critical temperature is approached",
    "the microscopic details of the system are irrelevant for its critical behavior .",
    "this intuitive picture has its foundation in the renormalization group treatment of second order phase transitions . within the renormalization group treatment",
    "it becomes evident that the critical behavior can be divided into different universality classes .",

    "if the system is confined in a finite geometry ( e.g. a cubic or film geometry ) the singularities in the physical quantities are smoothed out or a crossover to lower - dimensional critical behavior takes place .",

    "we believe that the vortex density was almost homogeneous throughout the films used for these measurements .",
    "this situation corresponds to the @xmath0 model in a film geometry with periodic boundary conditions along the film direction where the vortex density is the same everywhere .      in this section",
    "we would like to investigate the finite - size behavior of the specific heat @xmath203 . since we do not possess an easily handable procedure to take the @xmath109 limit for the values of the specific heat @xmath204 computed on finite lattices @xmath205 we approximate films with infinite planar dimension by @xmath206 lattices .",
    "this seems justified because the specific heat appears independent of @xmath4 for @xmath207 ( cf .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we do not expect the maximum of the specific heat to grow dramatically with increasing values of @xmath4 because for temperatures in the range @xmath208 the behavior of the specific heat can be described by the kosterlitz - thouless theory which leads to a finite value of this maximum . in order to illustrate this argument we show in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the size dependence of the specific heat @xmath209 computed on pure two - dimensional lattices @xmath210 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of the specific heat can be neglected for values of @xmath211 .    in fig .",

    "the specific heat values for films of thickness @xmath168 lie above the bulk curve for @xmath214 .",
    "such a behavior is also found in experiments on helium films about 30 thick @xcite .",
    "this crossing effect is due to the large shift of the temperature @xmath215 where the specific heat for a certain film thickness takes its maximum down to temperatures below the bulk critical temperature @xmath6 . for",
    "thicker and thicker films the maximum temperature @xmath215 approaches @xmath6 , thus the confined specific heat data will fall below the bulk curve which is expected from the field theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "the film thicknesses used in our monte carlo calculation range from @xmath216 to @xmath217 ( the lattice spacing @xmath194 @xcite ) which is comparable to the experimental film thicknesses ( 30 ) where this crossing effect can be observed . fig .",
    "[ fig13b ] shows the specific heat of the film with @xmath139 alone , indicating that the effect of crossing the bulk curve indeed vanishes for thicker and thicker films .",
    "unfortunately it is beyond our means to carry out the necessary analysis for thicker films than were treated here .",
    "it is interesting to note that we find the same qualitative behavior of the specific heat in the case of the @xmath0 model in a cylindrical geometry @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8b ] we plot the scaling function @xmath99 given by expression ( [ cimph ] ) .",
    "according to the previous discussion this scaling function can only be an approximation to the correct one which one would need to compute from films with @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "we find that our data for the specific heat for films of various thicknesses collapse approximately onto a single curve .",
    "it seems that the specific heat is rather insensitive to the boundary effect of introducing an effective thickness and a very high accuracy in the computation of the specific heat is needed to detect the presence of the effective thickness in the scaling function @xmath99 .",
    "for example , one could determine the temperatures @xmath220 where the specific heat reaches its maximum and examine the validity of eq .",
    "( [ tch ] ) for @xmath220 , because the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath220 is also given by expression ( [ tch ] ) ( with a different value for @xmath94 than for the critical temperatures @xmath31 ) .",
    "this can be done more easily in experiments because in monte carlo calculations an extrapolation procedure for the values of the specific heat at finite planar dimensions to the values at infinite planar dimensions is needed ( and which is not available at present ) whereas the films used in experiments represent films with infinite planar dimensions .",
    "we can directly compare our function @xmath221 to the experimentally determined scaling function @xmath99 given in refs .",
    "@xcite by expressing all lattice units in physical units using the conversion formula : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the molar volume of @xmath19 at saturated vapor pressure at @xmath6 , the lattice spacing @xmath194 @xcite and the film thickness is measured in  . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we compare the functions @xmath99 obtained from monte carlo calculations of the specific heat of films with periodic boundary conditions and staggered boundary conditions in the direction of the film thickness to the experimentally determined function @xmath99 and to the function @xmath99 obtained from field theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "this figure clearly shows the influence of the boundary conditions on the shape of the universal function as was already demonstrated by the field theoretical calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we see that the scaling function @xmath99 for films with staggered boundary conditions crosses the scaling function @xmath99 for films with periodic boundary conditions ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) in the range @xmath224 ( cf .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) with @xmath3 measured in  .",
    "this crossing is due to the relative smallness of our film thicknesses ( see the discussion above ) and does not occur if we had used much thicker films in our monte carlo calculations to deduce the scaling function @xmath225 @xcite .",
    "we expect our function @xmath225 to be slightly modified in the range @xmath224 ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig12 ] ) when it is computed from much thicker films .",
    "we believe that the wings of our curve , however , will remain unchanged .",
    "unfortunately , it is beyond our computational means to repeat the calculations for thicknesses larger than 24 .",
    "our findings suggest that it is possible to introduce an effective thickness @xmath167 into the scaling expressions for the superfluid density ( [ tyh ] ) and achieve scaling ( i.e. data collapse ) even for rather thin films .",
    "the increment @xmath8 over the film thickness @xmath3 can be understood as an effective correction to scaling .",
    "the appearance of the effective thickness in our scaling - function can be understood as follows .",
    "the superfluid density has a finite value in the first layers next to the boundary layers of the film , and its rise from this finite value to its bulk value @xmath226 ( for @xmath227 ) inside the film can be divided into two regions .",
    "let us assume that @xmath119 is very close to @xmath165 where the correlation length is very large .",
    "there is a rather narrow region of thickness @xmath228 of the film which is in contact with the boundary wall where the superfluid density rises very fast to attain some value @xmath229 .",
    "then it rises with a much slower rate over a length scale of the order of the correlation length to reach its value of @xmath230 .",
    "the reason for the initial fast rise are the correlations over length scales much smaller than the correlation length .",
    "one might think that one then has to exclude the region of the film where the superfluid density rises very sharply and this leads to a negative value for @xmath8 .",
    "however , this initial rise of @xmath231 occurs very fast over a length scale @xmath228 which is smaller than a length @xmath232 which would have been required in order for the superfluid density to reach the same value if this rise would have occurred over larger distances over which the spin - spin correlations are governed by the correlation length which controls the long distance behavior of the correlation function .",
    "this implies that the required increment to the thickness is @xmath233 , which is positive .    only for films with thicknesses",
    "@xmath3 which fulfill @xmath234 scaling with @xmath3 can be observed . for periodic boundary conditions we have @xmath235 @xcite",
    ", open boundary conditions seem to yield @xmath236 and for staggered boundary conditions we obtain @xmath237 . due to their structure staggered boundary conditions",
    "support vortex formation close to the boundaries , thus the superfluid density decreases from its maximum in the middle of the film towards the boundaries .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for open and absent for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our results imply that the more the superfluid density is suppressed near the boundaries the larger is the value of @xmath8 . the data for the superfluid density of rhee et al .",
    "@xcite which correspond to @xmath19 on si require a large value of @xmath238 .",
    "thus , si should suppress the superfluid density dramatically close to the boundary .",
    "since @xmath8 is so large , only films with @xmath239 should allow scaling with @xmath3",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the scaling behavior of the superfluid density of @xmath19 on different substrates ( which represent different types of boundary conditions ) in a wide range of film thicknesses to check our hypothesis .",
    "a consequence of scaling our data of the helicity modulus ( or superfluid density ) using an effective thickness is that the jump in the quantity @xmath202 depends on the boundary conditions in the top and bottom layers of the film , i.e. on the substrates in real helium experiments .",
    "the value of the jump is only @xmath89 ( in lattice units ) for film thicknesses small compared to @xmath8 as is the case in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "the same value of the jump was found is the case for @xmath0 films with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "thus , experiments could be also used to determine the jump in the areal superfluid density at the kosterlitz - thouless temperature and determine its substrate dependence .    in this work",
    "we represented the substrate by a staggered spin configuration coupled to the top and bottom layers of the film to simulate dirichlet - like boundary conditions ( zero order parameter in the boundary ) in the substrate .",
    "for the staggered spin configuration the local magnetization is exactly zero on a plaquette , i.e. on a domain of the size @xmath240 where @xmath59 denotes the lattice spacing .",
    "dirichlet - like boundary conditions in the substrate are , however , also realized by the following spin configuration : the spins are parallel in a square domain of linear dimension @xmath241 , but any two spins representing two adjacent domains are antiparallel to each other .",
    "thus , an additional length scale associated with a finite value of the local magnetization over the length scale @xmath241 is introduced and influences the scaling behavior of the helicity modulus and the specific heat .",
    "since disorder in the boundaries supports vortex formation close to the boundaries , vortices should play an active role in creating the boundary effect described above .",
    "we have investigated the finite - size scaling properties of the specific heat @xmath44 and the helicity modulus @xmath63 of the @xmath0 model in a film geometry , i.e. on @xmath1 lattices with @xmath2 where staggered and periodic boundary conditions where applied in the @xmath3-direction and the @xmath4-directions of the film , respectively .",
    "we found that a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition takes place at the @xmath3-dependent critical temperatures @xmath31 , however , for the films used in our calculations the jump @xmath242 appears to be @xmath3-dependent .",
    "furthermore , scaling of the helicity modulus according to eq .",
    "( [ tyh ] ) is not valid for our film thicknesses , neither is scaling according to eq .",
    "( [ yhtdbc ] ) which was derived following a suggestion of privman @xcite . introducing an effective thickness @xmath243 into the scaling expression ( [ tyh ] )",
    "we are able to collapse our data as well as the data of rhee et al .",
    "@xcite reasonably well onto one universal curve .",
    "our results suggest that the boundary effect of creating an effective thickness @xmath166 depends on the boundary conditions which can be realized in experiments by different substrates and is negligible for thicknesses @xmath3 which fulfill @xmath244 .",
    "we argue that the jump in the quantity @xmath202 depends on the boundary conditions and is @xmath89 only for certain ideal boundary conditions such as the periodic boundary conditions . within error",
    "bars scaling of the specific heat does not require an effective thickness and the scaling function @xmath99 for the specific heat agrees rather well with the experimentally determined scaling function @xmath99 and with the result of the renormalization group calculations reported in @xcite .",
    "however , we found that monte carlo simulations of much thicker films than we have used have to be performed to determine the position of the maximum of the scaling function accurately . at present",
