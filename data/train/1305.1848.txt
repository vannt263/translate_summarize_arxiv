    "iron - arsenic - based high - temperature superconductors @xcite encompass a large number of materials with remarkably similar phase diagrams , despite significant differences in their chemical compositions .",
    "both elemental substitutions and external parameters can be used to tune their physical properties.@xcite for example , in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 there is a high - temperature tetragonal to low - temperature orthorhombic structural phase transition at @xmath2  k accompanied by an antiferromagnetic spin density wave ( sdw ) transition .",
    "the sdw ground state can be suppressed in a number of ways , which in many cases leads to an emergence of superconductivity.@xcite these fe - based superconductors crystallize in the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type structure that consists of a square lattice of iron ions sandwiched by pnictogen or chalcogen layers forming tetrahedral chemical bonds with fe .",
    "iron fe@xmath3 ions play an important role in the supercondcutivity , as the main contribution to the density of states near the fermi energy is from the fe @xmath4 orbitals.@xcite the fermi surface ( fs ) of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 consists of hole and electron pockets at the center ( @xmath5-point ) and at the corner ( @xmath6-point ) of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , respectively , of the body - centered - tetragonal direct lattice containing two formula unit ( f.u . ) .",
    "there are hole and electron pockets that have very similar diameters , which leads to nesting that is most likely responsible for the sdw ordering@xcite and antiferromagnetism in the _ a_fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( _ a _ = ca , sr , ba , eu ) parent compounds.@xcite previous studies demonstrated that an antiferromagnetic sdw phase is the ground state of these materials and leads to a substantial reconstruction of the fermi surface at low temperature,@xcite which disappears close to the carrier concentration at which the onset of the superconducting dome begins.@xcite the co - substituted bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds are of particular interest since a rigid - band - like change of the chemical potential is reported with co concentration.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown , using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , that the co substitutions induces a lifshitz transition at the onset of the superconducting dome@xcite and another change in the fs topology occurs with an electron pocket appearing around the @xmath5 point at higher ( @xmath7 ) substitution levels,@xcite which is due to the change in the chemical potential that occurs by providing extra @xmath4 electrons to the system .    the large variation of properties of iron arsenic superconductors upon elemental substitutions calls for systematic investigations of the closely related materials , where all fe atoms are substituted by other transition metals .",
    "knowledge of their properties and electronic structure will not only improve understanding of the iron arsenic superconductors , but may also result in discoveries of novel materials with unusual and useful properties .",
    "in particular , the success in synthesizing co - based non - superconducting materials _",
    "a_co@xmath0as@xmath0 ( _ a _ = ca , sr ,",
    "ba , eu ) have attracted significant attention because of their many interesting physical properties.@xcite baco@xmath0as@xmath0 exhibits paramagnetic behavior where the absence of magnetic ordering is considered to be caused by quantum fluctuations.@xcite indeed , this compound is suggested to be a highly mass - renormalized metal near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point.@xcite it is believed that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations associated with a sdw are the pairing glue for superconductivity in the iron arsenides .",
    "however , ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are strongly pair breaking for spin - singlet pairing .",
    "the calculated electronic density of states ( dos ) of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 at @xmath8 is similar to those of the feas - based compounds ; however , the extra @xmath4 electron in co@xmath3 relative to fe@xmath3 shifts @xmath8 upwards in energy.@xcite this leads to the presence of a sharp peak in the dos at @xmath8 , which is derived from the co @xmath4 orbitals.@xcite therefore , the electronic structure of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 appears very different at @xmath8 than for the _ a_fe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds .",
    "it is of great interest to clarify the band structure of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 near @xmath8 , which can provide important insights into the microscopic mechanism of the peculiar magnetic and transport properties as of the _ a_co@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds .",
    "so far there are very few studies of this very interesting material @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present arpes measurements on single crystals of baco@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite that were carried out to clarify the above issues .",
    "we also present lda band structure calculations that are compared with the arpes data and we find reasonable agreement , confirming previous report@xcite .",
    "the measured intensity contours at higher binding energy ( @xmath9 500  mev ) very closely resemble the features near @xmath8 in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , which demonstrates that replacing fe ions with co ions causes a nearly rigid shift in the fermi energy by adding two electrons per ( f.u . ) for limited range of binding energies .",
    "we also report the presence of relatively flat bands in the proximity of @xmath8 , that are most likely responsible for peak in dos ( @xmath8 )",
    ". this may be important for understanding the transport and thermodynamic properties of this material .",
    "single crystals of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 were grown out of coas self - flux.@xcite the chemical compositions were checked by wavelength - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) that revealed the desired stoichiometry of @xmath10 .",
    "a rietveld refinement of x - ray diffraction data for crushed crystals confirmed that baco@xmath0as@xmath0 crystallizes in the body - centered tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure with lattice parameters @xmath11    and @xmath12    at room temperature , in good agreement with literature values.@xcite    we have performed high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements using a scienta r4000 electron analyzer at beamline 7.0.1 at the advanced light source ( als ) , berkeley , california .",
    "all samples were cleaved _ in situ _ , yielding flat mirror - like surfaces in the _ a - b _ plane .",
    "all the arpes data were collected in ultrahigh vacuum below @xmath13  mbar . the energy and momentum resolution were set to @xmath14  mev and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we measured several samples , which yielded similar results for the fermi surfaces .",
    "the @xmath8 was determined from the measurements on a au reference sample .",
    "the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method with the local density approximation@xcite was used to calculate the theoretical fs and band dispersions . to obtain self - consistent charge density",

    "k_@xmath32 , _ k_@xmath33 wave vector components and the intensity is obtained by integrating the spectra within @xmath2610  mev of @xmath8 .",
    "the shapes of the fs sheets in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 are very different from the roughly circular fss present in feas - based materials , which is not surprising , given that co contributes one electron more than fe .",
    "there is a significant difference in the shape of the intensity pattern between the first and second brillouin zones , most likely due to a combination of matrix element effects and three dimensionality of the electronic structure . since arpes can not measure the magnitude of the @xmath34-component of the momentum , we use a comparison with calculations to determine the relation between @xmath23 and photon energy . in fig .",
    "1(b ) we plot the calculated band structure that best matches the data measured with 85 ev photons .",

    "figure 2(a ) shows the intensity map at @xmath8 measured with 135  ev photons , while panel ( b ) shows the calculated fs for @xmath36 .",
    "the reasonable agreement in the overall shapes of the features indicates that we have made the correct assignment of @xmath23 .",
    "the fermi surfaces shown in figs .  1 and 2 consist of several sheets .",
    "to examine their character , we have plotted in fig .  3 ( upper panels ) the experimental band dispersions along the four different momentum cuts # 1 , # 2 , # 3 and # 4 shown in fig .",
    "the band dispersion plot in cut # 1 is from ( @xmath37 , 0 ) to ( @xmath38 , 0 ) , which shows a small electron pocket at the center of the bz ( @xmath5 point ) with fermi momenta @xmath39 .",
    "the bottom of this electron pocket is located about 300  mev below @xmath8 and it touches the top of a fully occupied band .",
    "an appearance of the electron pocket at @xmath5 is expected based on a doping study of ba(fe@xmath40co@xmath32)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( ref .  ) since co provides one extra electron and shifts @xmath8 upwards in energy .",
    "in addition , two smaller pockets are observed at fermi momenta @xmath41 .",
    "the band dispersion plot in cut # 2 is from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and shows larger electron pockets at the corner of the first bz at @xmath44 with @xmath45",
    ". cut # 3 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 shows a large electron pocket that has fermi momenta similar to the previous one .",
    "finally , we plot cut # 4 , from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , which again shows a small electron pocket at @xmath5 and large electron pockets at the @xmath6 points . in the lower panels , we show the corresponding calculated band dispersions , which are in reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we also note the presence of a rather flat portions of the bands in close proximity to @xmath8 visible in both the data and calculations for cuts # 3 and # 4 .",
    "these likely lead to an increase of the density of states at @xmath8 and therefore should have consequences for transport and thermodynamical properties . to further demonstrate this , we plot in fig .  4 ( left panel ) the energy distribution curves ( edcs ) in the range of momentum where this flat band is located ( marked by a white bar at the top of cut # 3 in fig .",
    "the edc peaks are nearly dispersionless and located in very close proximity to @xmath8 .",
    "the intensity of these peaks is very high , approaching the intensity of the valence band , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "4 .    in fig .  5",
    ", we compare the intensity maps of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 measured at different binding energies .",
    "it is seen that the electron pocket at the center of the bz shrinks to a point at about 400  mev below @xmath8 [ fig .",
    "below this energy a hole - like contour is present that increases in size with increasing binding energy . at about 500  mev below @xmath8",
    "the size of this hole contour is comparable to the hole fs sheet observed in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the electron pocket at the corner of the bz shrinks in size with increasing binding energy and reaches the size comparable to the feas - based material at about 500  mev binding energy .",
    "in fact the intensity plot in fig .",
    "5(f ) looks very much like the fs of unsubstituted bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that substitution of co for fe mostly shifts the chemical potential without significantly changing the band dispersions .",
    "thus , fully substituting the fe by co corresponds to an upward shift of the chemical potential by @xmath9500  mev . in fig .  6",
    ", we compare the fermi surface of ba(fe@xmath40co@xmath32)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( adopted from ref .  ) with constant energy intensity plots at high binding energy of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 samples .",
    "the values of binding energies were chosen to match roughly the size of the contours of the electron bands in the upper and lower panels ( fig .",
    "6 ) , respectively .",
    "we note that the plots at high binding energy of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 quite well match the shape and size of the fermi surface of ba(fe@xmath40co@xmath32)@xmath0as@xmath0 , implying that a rigid band shift is a good approximation for low lying bands .",
    "however , at lower binding energies in baco@xmath0as@xmath0 and higher cobalt concentrations in ba(fe@xmath40co@xmath32)@xmath0as@xmath0 , the shape and size of the contour at the zone center are quite different , despite the good match at the zone corners .",
    "this signifies that the rigid band shift breaks down above -460 mev .",
    "we presented an angle - resolved photoemission study of the fermi surface and band structure of baco@xmath0as@xmath0 and compared these with theoretical calculations carried out using the fp - lapw method .",
    "reasonable qualitative agreement in the shape of the fs and band dispersion plots between the experiment and calculations was found .",
    "the fermi surfaces consist of electron pockets both at the center and corner of the bz .",
    "the size of these pockets is very different prohibiting interband nesting .",
    "the measurements performed at higher binding energies ( @xmath9500 mev ) reveal intensity contours that are almost identical to the fermi surface of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "this agreement indicates that full substitution of fe by co results in a chemical potential increase of about 500 mev without significant renormalization in the band dispersions .",
