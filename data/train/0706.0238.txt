    "the abundance of nitrogen in galaxies and the site of its creation is critical for our understanding of galaxy chemical evolution .",
    "the ratio of n / o is especially useful because both of these elements are created by different mechanisms in different ranges of stellar mass .",
    "nitrogen is produced during hydrogen burning via the cno and cn cycles , and is created as both a primary and secondary element . in primary nucleosynthesis the production of nitrogen is independent of the initial metallicity of the star .",
    "primary production of nitrogen occurs predominantly only in intermediate mass stars ( 4@xmath5m@xmath6m@xmath7 @xmath58 ) @xcite where the nitrogen is produced during hydrogen shell burning while carbon and oxygen , which are assumed to be primary nucleosynthesis elements , are moved from the core to the outer stellar layers during dredge - up episodes .",
    "recent stellar models that include rotational effects indicate that massive stars between 9 and 20 m@xmath7 may produce primary nitrogen @xcite .",
    "these massive star models incorporate a convective helium burning shell that penetrates into the hydrogen burning shell , creating primary nitrogen . the discovery of metal - poor halo stars with high n / o ratios by @xcite and @xcite seems to confirm the primary production of nitrogen in massive stars with a yield that depends on stellar mass and metallicity @xcite . in secondary production",
    ", nitrogen is synthesized from the carbon and oxygen initially present in the star and its abundance is therefore proportional to the initial heavy element abundance .",
    "secondary production is common to stars of all masses @xcite .",
    "though the synthesis of nitrogen in stars is becoming better understood , our understanding of the abundance of nitrogen in galaxies is lacking .",
    "one way to investigate the primary versus secondary origin of nitrogen is to examine the ratio of n / o as a function of o / h . these abundance ratios are commonly computed from optical nebular emission lines of hii regions ( see  5 ) . in the case of primary nucleosynthesis n / o will be constant ; secondary enrichment produces a linear correlation between log n / o and log o / h .",
    "the combination of primary and secondary nucleosynthesis produces a non - linear relation ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the abundance ratios of many other elements such as neon , sulfur , and iron with respect to oxygen have been found to tightly correlate with o / h @xcite , yet at fixed o / h galaxies have been found to have a scatter in n / o of a factor of 2 @xcite . until recently , this problem could not be adequately addressed due to small sample sizes , and uncertain abundances .",
    "chemical evolution scenarios proposed to explain this scatter include ( 1 ) a primary plus secondary origin of nitrogen but with variable initial mass functions ( imfs ) @xcite , ( 2 ) a primary plus secondary origin but with a time delay between the release of nitrogen and the release of oxygen back into the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite . with regards to the former scenario , @xcite have found that an imf constant in space and time better reproduces the observational constraints of the solar neighborhood ( i.e. the ratio of metal - poor to metal - rich stars , the ratio of sn ii to sn i , and the ratio of he to metal abundance . ) .",
    "@xcite find that such an imf also helps reproduce the observed abundance gradient of the galactic disk more reliably than models with imfs that depend on metallicity or sfr . in the time delay chemical evolution model ,",
    "oxygen is released in the supernovae of short lived massive stars . as the metallicity of successive generations of massive stars increases , secondary nitrogen is also released , and then the bulk of nitrogen is released much later in intermediate mass stars .",
    "the chemical evolution models of @xcite for blue compact galaxies and @xcite for dwarf galaxies , incorporating the variation of stellar yields with stellar mass and stellar evolution timescales , have shown that the scatter in n / o could be reproduced by varying star formation histories .",
    "work by @xcite on abundances in barred spiral galaxies indicates that the nitrogen abundance is the result of both primary and secondary nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , nitrogen abundances taken from a small uv selected galaxy sample detected by foca @xcite show mostly a secondary component , but still with considerable scatter .",
    "they proposed that the difference between the two results arises because there is a time delay between the release of oxygen and nitrogen .",
    "the uv galaxies were starbursts ; consequently , the high mass stars formed during the starburst had released newly synthesized oxygen into the ism .",
    "this increased the oxygen abundance and lowered the n / o ratio of these galaxies such that their new nitrogen and oxygen abundances were consistent with only a secondary nitrogen component . then later ,",
    "once the intermediate mass stars formed during the burst have had time to evolve , nitrogen will be released into the ism .",
    "this would increase the nitrogen in these uv galaxies to a similar amount of n / o as the sample of @xcite .",
    "the time delay scenario , as stated by @xcite , may be oversimplified .",
    "it does not account for galaxies that have star formation histories differing from cycles of bursting phases followed by quiescent phases , and was made prior to any evidence for the production of primary nitrogen in massive stars @xcite .",
    "a more accurate statement is : the release of material by a star of mass , m into the ism will cause the n / o ratio of the ism to increase if its relative yield of p@xmath8/p@xmath9 is greater than 1 and decrease if its relative yield is less than 1 .",
    "the new nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields of @xcite still indicate that while massive stars ( m@xmath10m@xmath7 ) produce primary nitrogen , the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen yields for massive stars is @xmath11 and still decreases with increasing mass .",
    "thus , a burst of star formation will still initially cause a decrease in n / o , the effect of the new yields only diminishes the extent to which a starburst can conceivably lower n / o .",
    "all that is required for the n / o of a galaxy to increase is that its current sfr is less than its past average sfr such that comparatively fewer high mass stars are being formed , allowing for intermediate mass stars of previous generations to dominate the chemical enrichment of the galaxy .",
    "the large amount of uniformly calibrated data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has recently enabled robust statistical studies of chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite examined the ratio of n / o in metal - poor galaxies , @xmath12 , in sdss dr3 and concluded that the n / o ratio increases with increasing starburst age ( decreasing ew@xmath13 ) for metal - poor galaxies , due to the ejection of nitrogen by wolf - rayet stars .",
    "@xcite consider a @xmath14 galaxy sdss dr2 sample , and show that objects with higher n / o tend to have lower @xmath15 .",
    "this result is consistent with those galaxies with current star formation rates that are high with respect to their past average star formation rate , exhibiting a higher oxygen abundance .",
    "the oxygen is presumably contributed by the recently formed massive stars .",
    "here we examine the n / o ratio as a function of o / h in a sample of uv selected galaxies detected by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) , exploiting the overlap between the _ galex _ medium imaging survey and the sdss spectroscopic footprint in the local universe ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the large volume of data available from _",
    "galex_+sdss makes it possible to go beyond equivalent widths and calculate physical quantities like stellar masses , m@xmath17 , and specific star formation rates , sfr / m@xmath17 , which can be more easily compared with models when investigating chemical enrichment .",
    "we use the sfr / m@xmath17 and @xmath18 , of these galaxies derived from their 7-band uv - optical photometry @xcite to test whether the star formation history of a galaxy can explain the observed relationship between the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in our sample and investigate the accuracy of determined abundances .",
    "we note that o / h is not equivalent to a time axis , and the values of n / o and o / h represent the current chemical evolutionary stages for galaxies that have most likely had different histories of star formation and other dynamical processes such as galactic winds and gas accretion timescales @xcite . we expect , nevertheless , that if the time delay scenario is correct , that galaxies currently exhibiting a strong burst of star formation will on average have lower values of n / o than non - bursting galaxies at similar metallicities .",

    "the o3n2 value depends on a flux ratio containing [ nii]6584 , while @xmath61 is used to calculate the [ nii ] temperature required to determine the n / o ratio .",
    "furthermore , the models used to derive t04 have prior distributions of metallicities where nitrogen abundance is selected to have a only a primary dependence on the oxygen abundance below @xmath101 o / h@xmath102 , and a completely secondary dependence for metallicities greater than this . t04 and",
    "o3n2 diagnostics are therefore predetermined to exhibit secondary nitrogen production , and are not useful in determining the relative amount of secondary or primary nitrogen in each galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the abundances determined by t04 may slightly overestimate abundances for galaxies that have an increased n / o ratio from primary+secondary nitrogen .",
    "the likelihood estimates of t04 depend on the flux from nitrogen emission lines , but only consider that nitrogen is secondary in origin , and do not accurately account for nitrogen fluxes from galaxies containing secondary plus primary nitrogen .",
    "of the three diagnostics , the m91 calculation has the least dependence on the n / o diagnostic .",
    "this is because the n / o calculation depends slightly on the temperature estimate obtained by @xmath61 , which introduces a scatter in n / o that increases from @xmath103 dex at the lowest values of n / o to @xmath94 dex at highest n / o values .",
    "the fact that o3n2 and t04 show a similar secondary dependence on n / o as m91 is an indication that the interdependence between the n / o calculation and t04 or o3n2 is only a small effect .",
    "the main results emerge when we consider the relationship between n / o and o / h as a function of specific star formation rate .",
    "figure 2 gives several interesting results .",
    "first , for galaxies with high abundances ( @xmath101 o / h@xmath104 ) , the m91 and t04 diagnostics both indicate that for galaxies with similar o / h , the most extreme starbursts ( highest values of sfr/@xmath18 ) tend to have lower n / o .",
    "this is shown more clearly in figures 3 and 4 . in these figures",
    "we divide our emission sample into sub - samples of specific star formation rate : log sfr / m@xmath105 ( red points ) , @xmath106log sfr / m@xmath107 ( green points ) , and log sfr / m@xmath108 ( blue points ) .",
    "we then calculate the mean n / o value and error on the mean for each of the sub - samples in increments of @xmath82 dex in @xmath109 o / h .",
    "figure 3 plots the mean n / o values for each sub - sample as a function of metallicity , and figure 4 plots the difference between the mean n / o value in each sub - sample and the mean n / o value for the entire sample .",
    "tables 3 , 4 and 5 list the mean values of n / o , the errors on the mean , and the number of galaxies for each bin of o / h with more than 30 galaxies in each sub - sample .",
    "all three diagnostics show that the galaxies with log sfr / m@xmath110 have lower n / o values than galaxies in the lowest specific star formation rate sub - sample ( log sfr / m@xmath105 ) in each decrement of metallicity between @xmath111 and @xmath112 dex .",
    "as metallicity increases , and nitrogen becomes largely secondary in origin , and the difference between the n / o ratios of the sub - sample with the lowest specific star formation rates and the other two sub - samples decreases .",
    "the m91 and t04 diagnostics also show that the most extreme starbursts ( log sfr / m@xmath108 ) at intermediate metallicities on average have n / o ratios @xmath113 dex lower than galaxies with average specific star formation rates , @xmath106log sfr / m@xmath107 , a decrease in n / o of @xmath114 .",
    "the o3n2 diagnostic shows the opposite trend of the other two diagnostics since o3n2 is not corrected for ionization parameter . at the lowest and highest metallicities no difference",
    "is found between the n / o ratios of the two sub - samples in all three diagnostics .",
    "our findings are consistent with similar conclusions reached by @xcite .",
    "the galaxies with the lower specific star formation rates have the highest n / o ratios because they are currently forming comparatively fewer high mass stars .",
    "this allows the chemical enrichment of the galaxy to be dominated by the products of intermediate mass stars , which generate more nitrogen than oxygen , causing n / o in these galaxies to rise . at low metallicities",
    "no difference is found between the n / o ratios of the the most extreme starbursts and the average star - forming sub - samples .",
    "this is because there are only a small number of galaxies in our sample with low metallicities and most of these are in the sub - sample with the highest specific star formation rates . at high metallicities",
    ", no difference is found between the the most extreme starbursts and the average star - forming sub - sample .",
    "this is presumably because the oxygen generated by the high mass stars formed during the latest starburst constitutes only a small fraction of the total oxygen abundance of the galaxy and has little effect on lowering the n / o ratio . at intermediate metallicities",
    "the oxygen abundance is relatively small , such that the oxygen created in a starburst constitutes a large fraction of the oxygen abundance of a galaxy and causes a larger decrease in the n / o ratio .    other possible explanations for the n / o ratios are variable imfs and galactic winds .",
    "an imf that produces more massive stars for galaxies with higher specific star formation rates , could possibly cause the low n / o ratios of the strongest starbursts seen in figures 2,3 , and 4 .",
    "such a variable imf could plausibly have a slope parametrized by either metallicity , sfr , or both .",
    "@xcite conjectures that the imfs of starbursts may be weighted to form more massive stars , and several authors have previously parametrized imfs with a dependence on metallicity @xcite . at this time",
    ", the validity of a variable imf and its effect on the abundances can not be assessed .",
    "we find no need to invoke a variable imf to model the uv and optical seds of these galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have found that that chemical evolution models for the galaxy that use a metallicity dependent imf do not adequately reproduce the observational constraints of the solar neighborhood .",
    "galaxies with high specific star formation rates could also have galactic winds that differentially remove one element with respect to the other . with regards to differential flow of oxygen , @xcite examined the ratio of n / o for a sample of dwarf galaxies , and argues that their data suggests that either differential outflow of oxygen occurs in every galaxy in their sample with the same efficiency or that differential outflow of oxygen has a negligible effect on n / o ratios .",
    "they found that the correlation of oxygen abundance with optical luminosity for their sample had a lower scatter than the correlation of nitrogen abundance with optical luminosity .",
    "they argue that if differential outflow was the cause of the scatter in n / o , then the oxygen - luminosity correlation should have a larger scatter than the nitrogen - luminosity correlation , since the the outflow of oxygen would depend on other galaxy parameters such as galaxy mass , and ism structure .",
    "nitrogen may be differentially removed in galaxies that have high specific star formation rates , but there is no reasonable explanation as to why this might occur .",
    "in fact , one would expect the opposite , that oxygen and not nitrogen would be differentially removed in starbursts since the kinetic energy responsible for ejecting the material likely comes from the supernovae of high mass stars that produce very little nitrogen with respect to oxygen .      in order to further test the above explanation , we plot the nitrogen to oxygen relationship again , with the pixels scaled by color with mean values of stellar mass , and _",
    "g - r _ color in figures 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "@xcite found a tight correlation of @xmath82 dex between increasing stellar mass and oxygen abundance , so we expect that mass will increase with o / h .",
    "figure 5 shows that the stellar mass increases with o / h with little dependence on n / o for all three methods . along the same lines , @xcite",
    "analyze a dwarf galaxy sample and conclude that a trend of increasing n / o correlates with redder b - v color and hence , lower star formation rate . based on this result",
    ", we expect that increasing values of n / o should correlate with redder g - r color . in figure 6",
    "we see that as n / o increases the average _",

    "/ h@xmath115 both m91 , and t04 show this trend . o3n2",
    "does not because it is not corrected for ionization effects .",
    "all methods of determining the oxygen abundance show a dependence on mass irrespective of their nitrogen abundance .",
    "the t04 and m91 diagnostics show that galaxies of similar metallicity but with higher",
    "n / o values have redder _ g - r _ color .",
    "these results suggest that the trend between higher specific star formation rates and lower n / o values is a real trend , but more reliable and consistent metallicity diagnostics are required to test this result .      as a further check",
    ", we use the @xmath91 method abundances to determine whether the trend for galaxies with higher sfr / m@xmath17 to have lower n / o ratios is genuine , and not produced by the strong line abundance calculations themselves due to a dependence on an unknown galaxy parameter .",
    "the abundances derived from the _",
    "@xmath60 _ method are dependent only on electron temperature and density , and the n / o ratio calculated by this method is not predetermined to show secondary dependence . in figure 7",
    "we show the n / o ratio versus o / h for the 33 galaxies with abundances measured by the _ @xmath60 _ method . in the upper",
    "left the points are colored by their _",
    "g - r _ optical colors .",
    "even though there is a good deal of scatter in the figure , the galaxies that have the lowest n / o ratios tend to be the bluest in _",
    "g - r _ , with the mean value of @xmath116 and a standard error on the mean of @xmath117 for galaxies with @xmath118 and _ g - r _",
    "@xmath119 with a standard error on the mean of @xmath120 for galaxies with @xmath121 .",
    "these galaxies also tend to have slightly higher specific star formation rates with a mean difference of @xmath122 dex between galaxies with @xmath118 and galaxies with @xmath123 .",
    "the galaxies with lower n / o ratios also have slightly higher h@xmath32 equivalent widths , which is an indicator of the current star formation relative to past star formation , on timescales of 10 myr .",
    "the sed fitting indicates that to a 95% reliability at least half of these galaxies formed 1% ( and as much as @xmath124 ) of their stellar mass in bursts within the last 100myr .",
    "if there is indeed a time delay between the release of oxygen from the massive stars and nitrogen from the intermediate mass stars , then these starburst galaxies should have an influx of newly synthesized oxygen that will raise the oxygen abundance and reduce the n / o ratio .",
    "the results from the _ @xmath60 _ abundances slightly favor this scenario , but due to the small sample of galaxies with 3@xmath30 detections of [ oiii]4363 , the small range of specific star formation rates , and the uncertainties on the abundances , we are unable to discern if the star formation history is really the cause of the scatter of n / o values for the _ @xmath60 _ sample .",
    "we would expect that since all of the 33 galaxies are large starbursts , that the n / o ratios would lie close to the secondary nitrogen curve .",
    "the explanation posited by @xcite for the scatter in n / o for galaxies with similar metallicities is that the wolf rayet stars in these galaxies have released a significant amount of nitrogen from winds , which being an order of magnitude more dense than the surrounding ism can cause the n / o ratio to appear high , increasing by as much as @xmath125 dex .",
    "the n / o ratio will decrease as the nitrogen from the wr winds has time to diffuse into density equilibrium with the ism , raising the overall ism log n / o ratio by @xmath126 dex .",
    "however , the chemical evolution models of @xcite show that the scatter in n / o ratios of dwarf galaxies at metallicities similar to those in our our _ @xmath60 _ sample can be explained by different star formation histories , different burst strengths , and burst durations ; they show that there is no need to invoke nitrogen from winds of massive stars to show this effect .",
    "the galaxies with @xmath121 have on average only slightly bluer optical colors than the rest of the _ @xmath60 _ galaxies .",
    "this indicates that intermediate mass stars from the last major star formation event may be responsible for the high n / o ratios , but does not rule out that winds could cause a portion of the observed scatter , ( though the errors on the measured abundances are able to account for a large portion of the observed scatter in n / o ) . to resolve this issue , and effect of variable imfs or other dynamical processes on n / o such as mixing timescales of the newly synthesized material ,",
    "more reliable and consistent metallicity measurements are needed , with errors in the derived abundance less than @xmath82 dex .",
