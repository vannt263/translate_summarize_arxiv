    "coherent control of multiphoton processes in atoms and molecules using shaped femtosecond pulses is a subject of both fundamental and applicative importance @xcite .",
    "the broad spectrum of the femtosecond pulses photo - induces a coherent manifold of state - to - state initial - to - final pathways that by manipulating their interference state - to - state transition probabilities are controlled .",
    "inducing constructive or destructive interferences among these pathways leads to either an enhancement or attenuation , respectively , of the transition probability .",
    "it is achieved by tailoring the shape of the femtosecond pulse .",
    "experimentally , it is implemented using pulse shaping techniques that are applied in the frequency domain to control the spectral characteristics of the pulse @xcite .",
    "rational design of the pulse shape is based on identifying the state - to - state interfering pathways and their interfering mechanisms . as the pulse shaping is conducted in the frequency domain ,",
    "rational pulse design is most powerful when the potoexcitation picture is available in the frequency domain .",
    "this is possible once the excitation is validly described by the time - dependent perturbation theory of finite order , following a proper fourier transformation to the frequency domain .",
    "such rational control has been demonstrated successfully in many cases @xcite .",
    "however , until recently , it has been implemented only in the weak - field regime @xcite , where the multiphoton process is described by the time - dependent perturbation theory of the lowest nonvanishing order . for n - photon process",
    "it is the nth perturbative order .",
    "the simplicity of this theoretical description is the attractiveness of the weak - field regime .",
    "still , it has a considerable downside of being limited to low excitation yields , typically up to only @xmath10.1@xmath0 population transfer .",
    "recently , we have extended theoretically and experimentally the rational pulse design approach to the intermediate - field regime @xcite , where the excitation yields exceed by two orders of magnitude the weak - field yields , reaching 10 - 20@xmath0 population transfer . in this regime",
    ", the perturbative description of the multiphoton process needs to additionally include also the next non - vanishing order beyond the lowest one , i.e. orders n and n+2 for n - photon process .",
    "specifically , we have studied the process of atomic two - photon absorption @xcite . in the weak - field regime",
    "it is described by second - order perturbation theory , while in the intermediate - field regime it is described by forth - order perturbation theory considering both the second and forth perturbative orders .",
    "physically , the corresponding weak - field absorption involves initial - to - final nonresonant excitation pathways that are composed of two absorbed photons , while the intermediate - field absorption also involves additional resonance - mediated pathways that are composed of three absorbed photons and one emitted photon .",
    "consequently , as already has been shown a decade ago @xcite , the weak - field two - photo absorption is maximized by the transform - limited ( tl ) having zero ( relative ) phase across the whole spectrum as well as by any shaped pulse having a spectral phase that is antisymmetric around one - half of the two - photon transition frequency @xmath2 . on the other hand , as we have recently shown in short @xcite , in the intermediate - field regime the shaped pulses with antisymmetric phase patterns actually enhance the absorption beyond the level induced by the tl pulse .",
    "it occurs when the center of the pulse spectrum is detuned from @xmath3 , either to the red or to the blue according to the system .",
    "the enhancement of the intermediate - field two - photon absorption by shaped pulses with spectral phase patterns of antisymmetric nature is the subject of the present theoretical and experimental work .",
    "the coherent interference mechanism leading to the observed enhancement is studied and analyzed in detail using forth - order frequency - domain perturbative analysis .",
    "we also show that , even though the maximal enhancement is achieved with phase patterns of perfect antisymmetry , at high - enough intermediate - field intensities absorption enhancement beyond the tl level is still achievable even with patterns having some degree of deviation from perfect antisymmetry .",
    "the corresponding degree of tolerance to deviations from perfect antisymmetry increases as the pulse intensity increases .",
    "the theoretical and experimental model system of the study is atomic sodium ( na ) . beyond the basic scientific understanding ,",
    "these findings are also of significance for coherent control scenarios that simultaneously involve multiple excitation channels .",
    "for example , the tolerance to deviation from perfect antisymmetry allows to keep the excitation of the two - photon channel sufficiently high , while adjusting the excitation of the other channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii gives first the frequency - domain theoretical description of the intermediate - field femtosecond two - photon absorption process and then refers to the case when the absorption is induced by shaped pulses having phase patterns of antisymmetric nature .",

    "the interference of the pathways corresponding to the flipped bins with the rest of the pathways has turned to be a destructive one . this fact is reflected in the value of @xmath157 for these phase patterns that is reduced and does not reach the corresponding value of the tl pulse : @xmath172 .",
    "the peak shape of @xmath170 has also been changed as compared to the antisymmetric phase pattern . on the other hand , although the peak shape of @xmath43 has been changed , it remains symmetrical about @xmath36 and the value of @xmath173 remains equal to that of the tl pulse as it is actually phase - pattern - independent .",

    "the mechanism of the enhancement follows from the interference nature between the perturbative orders : although the values of @xmath157 are smaller for the modified antisymmetric phase pattern , the attenuation by @xmath158 stays low , close to the values of the perfectly antisymmetric pattern , as compared to the tl pulse . at sufficiently high intensity the resulted total population of the final state",

    "in conclusion , we have identified an extended family of phase shaped - pulses that , as opposed to the weak - field regime , in the intermediate - field regime enhance the two - photon absorption beyond the absorption level induced by the transform - limited pulse .",
    "this corresponding phase patterns are of antisymmetric nature about one - half the two - photon transition frequency .",
    "the phase - patterns are demonstrated to be robust to imperfections in their antisymmetry : even though the largest enhancement is achieved with phase patterns of perfect antisymmetry , at high enough intermediate - field intensities absorption enhancement is still achievable even with patterns that deviate from perfect antisymmetry .",
