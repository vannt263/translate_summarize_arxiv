    "these silica microcavities feature whispering gallery type modes ( wgms ) and rely upon exquisite smoothness at the cavity dielectric boundary to attain ultra - high - q performance that is typically in excess of 100 million . for nonlinear optical studies , strong resonant buildup of energy in microscale volumes",
    "significantly reduces the threshold for nonlinear optical effects to occur .",
    "this was recognized in the pioneering work of chang changscience@xcite and campillo @xcitecampilloqed@xcitewho observed and studied a variety of nonlinear optical effects in ultra - high - q liquid microdoplets . their work used free - space illumination to optically pump the microdroplets and thereby induce raman oscillation @xcite@xcitecampillooptcomm , cascaded raman scattering @xcite and brillouin scattering@xcite .",
    "silica uhq stims provide a far more stable and robust microcavity in comparison with liquid microdroplets .",

    "fiber tapers provide remarkably efficient coupling to and from the uhq silica sphere system @xcite@xciteand enable direct access to the technologically important optical fiber transport medium . the measured fiber - coupled threshold for a variety of nonlinear phenomena in taper - coupled , silica microspheres are lower than for any other nonlinear oscillator reported to date .",
    "silica microsphere raman lasers with ultra - low threshold levels of only 62 @xmath1-watts @xcite have been demonstrated .",
    "compared to microdroplets these devices allow stable and long term observation of nonlinear optical effects in microcavities . cascaded raman lasing in these devices of up to 5 orders has also been observed min .  the tapered optical fiber in these experiments functions to both pump wgms as well as to extract the nonlinear raman fields . in addition",
    ", the tapered - fiber coupling junction is highly ideal@xcite , making it possible to strongly overcouple ultra - high - q cavities with negligible junction loss .",
    "this feature allows for the observation of very high _ internal _ differential photon conversion efficiencies approaching unity . whereas microspheres are both compact and efficient nonlinear oscillators , their fabrication properties lack the control and parallelism typical of microfabrication techniques .",
    "recently - developed ultra - high - q toroid microcavities on - a - chip @xcite provide a uhq silica device with performance equivalent to a microsphere .",
    "uhq toroids have several advantages over spheres including being wafer - scale devices that can be fabricated in parallel as dense arrays or integrated with electronics or other optical functionality . in this paper , we demonstrate and analyze nonlinear raman oscillation in both microsphere and microtoroid on - a - chip structures .",
    "in addition to studying raman oscillation in microcavities in detail , this work allows us to compare the performance and properties of toroidal and spherical microcavities .",
    "in addition to their fabrication and integration advantages , it will be seen that microtoroids also have performance advantages in comparison to microspheres .",
    "this includes a reduced number of supported azimuthal modes , which allows observation of single - mode raman oscillation over a large range of pump powers@xcite ( of critical importance in practical applications ) , as well lower raman threshold due to a reduced mode volume compared to a spherical cavity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows",
    ". the first section will give a brief introduction into the fabrication , coupling and optical properties of ultra - high - q toroid on - a - chip and spherical microcavities .",
    "the second section will present a model for raman lasing in a waveguide - coupled whispering - gallery - mode resonator .",
    "there , we derive the expression for the threshold and the efficiency of the conversion process . in the ultra - high - q regime resonances",
    "are easily split into doublets due to intermode coupling of the degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise propagating whispering gallery modes@xcite .",
    "the effect of this intermode coupling on stimulated raman scattering is also considered in this section .",
    "the case of cascaded raman oscillation in which raman signals serve to pump and generate higher - order raman waves is also treated in the section . in the fourth section ,",
    "the theoretical results are compared with experimental studies of the dependence of raman threshold on quality - factor , mode volume and waveguide loading .",
    "experimental results concerning power and efficiency during cascaded operation are presented and compared to theory and found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , a comparison of microtoroid oscillation properties with those of microspheres is presented in the fifth section .",
    "surface - tension - induced microcavities such as micro - droplets , exhibit a superb , cavity surface finish ( typically nanometer surface roughnessvernooyq ) leading to whispering gallery type modes with some of the highest optical quality factors recorded to date . in the work presented here ,",
    "both spherical and toroid microcavities on - a - chip made from silica are investigated . both types of structures exhibit q - factors in excess of 100 million .",
    "briefly , the fabrication of both micro - sphere and micro - toroids relies upon surface tension to induce collapse of a given silica preform into the final cavity shape .",
    "because the cavity fabrication involves a temporary liquid state the surface finish of the final `` solid '' microcavity is excellent . in the case of a microsphere",
    ", the preform used here is an optical fiber tip which is heated and melted with a carbon - dioxide laser ( 10.6 @xmath2 wavelength ) .",
    "surface tension causes the silica fiber tip to contract and form a spherical microcavity , while the remainder of the fiber stem serves as a holder for sphere - positioning .",
    "light within the sphere is confined near an equatorial plane by continuous total internal reflection at the cavity interface .",
    "microtoroids , on the other hand , use wafer microfabrication techniques involving a combination of lithography and etching combined with a final selective reflow process using a co@xmath3 laser .",
    "the details of this fabrication process are reported in reference @xcite . in the case of toroid microcavities",
    "the preform consists of a microfabricated silica disk supported by a silicon pillar .",
    "illumination of the disk using a co@xmath3 laser induces selective reflow of the silica .",
    "surface tension causes the disk preform to collapse into a toroidal periphery , thereby creating the resonant cavity .",
    "figure 1 contains an optical micrograph of a microsphere and a microtoroid on - a - chip .",
    "highly efficient evanescent coupling to these micro - cavities can be achieved by use of tapered optical fibers @xcite@xcite , which are fabricated by melting and adiabatically tapering a standard , telecommunication fiber until a waist diameter of approximately 1 to 2 microns is reached . when brought into proximity of the  wgm resonator and when the taper waist diameter is chosen to phase match to the wgms , efficient coupling both to and from the microcavity can be achieved .",
    "coupling can be described by the normalized coupling parameter @xmath4 which describes the ratio of intrinsic resonator lifetime  @xmath5 to the external ( coupling related ) lifetime @xmath6 . following the standard conventions@xcite ,",
    "undercoupling is denoted by @xmath7 , overcoupling by @xmath8 , and critical coupling ( the point of vanishing waveguide transmission ) is denoted by @xmath9 the ability to achieve strong overcoupling is important as it exemplifies the very ideal nature@xcite of the taper - microcavity , coupling junction .",
    "in addition to efficient excitation and extraction of optical power , the fiber taper provides direct coupling to optical fiber , thereby further facilitating laboratory measurements . in the case of microtoroids on - a - chip",
    "the taper is also crucial as a means of `` probing '' the whispering gallery devices which are within a few microns of the silicon wafer surface .",
    "using tapered optical fibers , resonator quality factor can be inferred from either linewidth measurements or cavity ringdown experiments@xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows a cavity ringdown measurement on a 45-@xmath2-diameter microtoroid at 1550 nm , exhibiting a critically coupled q of @xmath10 . in this measurement",
    "the wgm was excited on resonance , and the fiber - taper adjusted to the critical point .",
    "the cavity lifetime can then be inferred by gating - off the excitation laser , and recording the cavity decay signal . the critically coupled q ( including the waveguide coupling contributions )",
    "was 100 million , and when correcting the q for the waveguide loading , as described in section iii.b , an intrinsic quality factor of @xmath11 is inferred .",
    "raman scattering in a waveguide coupled microcavity can be described classically by using coupled mode equations for the pump and raman fields with nonlinear raman coupling terms .",
    "other nonlinear effects , which can compete with raman scattering , such as four - wave - mixing or brillouin scattering are not considered in this analysis as the microcavity poses stringent frequency matching constraints on these processes making their observation difficult . in the case of stimulated brillouin scattering ,",
    "the narrow gain bandwidth in the range of 100 mhz , makes overlap of cavity modes with the brillouin gain spectrum unlikely and was not observed in this work .  in the case of parametric oscillation mediated by the kerr - nonlinearity ( i.e. four - wave mixing )",
    ", energy conservation requires a triple resonance condition for signal , idler and pump mode , which can be satisfied only under certain conditions@xcite .",
    "these additional constraints for oscillation based on the kerr nonlinearity or brillouin gain , cause stimulated raman scattering - which is intrinsically phase - matched- to be the dominant microcavity nonlinear optical effect . for simplification , we assume that the pump wavelength and the raman wave are on resonance and use the slowly varying envelope approximation . @xmath12here @xmath13 signifies the slowly - varying amplitude of the pump and raman wgm modes of the cavity and @xmath14 denotes the input wave .",
    "the excitation frequency of the pump mode and resonant raman mode is given by @xmath15 and @xmath16and @xmath17 is the total lifetime of photons in the resonator , which is related to the quality factor by @xmath18 .",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath19 denotes the coupling of the input pump wave @xmath20 to the cavity whispering - gallery - mode @xmath21 .",
    "the relation @xmath22 associates the coupling coefficient with a corresponding lifetime , such that @xmath23@xcite .",
    "since the raman effect will excite both eigenmodes of the cavity ( co- and counter - directionally propagating modes ) , equal amplitude emission occurs along both waveguide directions given by @xmath24 .",
    "the raman intra - cavity gain coefficient is denoted as @xmath25 , which can be related to the more commonly used gain coefficient @xmath26(measured in units of m / watt ) by , @xmath27where @xmath28 is the effective modal volume @xcite , and @xmath29 is the electric field vector @xcite .",
    "the effective mode volume accounts for the intensity dependent gain , and for silica microspheres and microtoroids has approximately twice  the value than the energy related definition of mode volume .",
    "steady state analysis of the coupled mode equations , results in a clamped , cavity , pump field above threshold .",
    "this clamping alters the coupling of pump power to the resonator , and , in turn , the pump power dependence of raman laser power such that the following square root dependence results .",
    "@xmath30the physical origin of this square root dependence of the pump - to - raman conversion can be viewed as a pumping inefficiency  i.e. the coupled pump power does not increase linearly with launched fiber power .",
    "the nonlinear dependence of coupled pump power can be illustrated by considering a pump wave that is initially _ _ critically coupled  _ _ to the resonator . as noted above",
    ", critical coupling features complete transfer and dissipation of power from the resonator ( i.e. , zero transmission ) . in terms of the fields involved in coupling both to and from the resonator , critical coupling results from the destructive interference of the cavity leakage field with the transmitted , pump field ( i.e. , the portion that does not couple to the resonator from the waveguide ) .",
    "once the onset of raman lasing is reached , the cavity pump field is clamped at the threshold value resulting in a fixed cavity pump leakage field .",
    "subsequent increase in launched pump power will imbalance the leakage and the transmitted pump fields , giving rise to finite transmission and a shift away from the critical point .",
    "the pump coupling to the resonator is thereby less and less efficient as the pump field is increased .",
    "the expression for the raman threshold pump power can be factorized into terms involving modal volume , waveguide - cavity coupling strength and cavity lifetime ( or quality factor ) . to facilitate separation of the coupling and intrinsic lifetime dependence",
    ", we use the dimensionless normalized coupling parameter @xmath31 . in the ideal case of a single - mode waveguide coupled to a whispering - gallery - mode the waveguide transmission as a function of coupling is given by @xmath32and @xmath33 typically varies exponentially with the waveguide - microcavity `` coupling gap '' distance @xcite . using these definitions  and under the assumption of equal coupling properties and photon lifetimes for both the pump and raman mode , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the threshold expression is given by:@xmath36here we have also introduced @xmath37 which is a possible correction factor to account for intermode coupling of the degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise propagating whispering - gallery modes .",
    "this factor will be explained in the next section .",
    "the threshold expression follows an inverse square dependence on the quality factor .",
    "this reflects the fact that an increase in q will cause a twofold benefit in terms of both reducing cavity round trip losses that must be overcome for threshold as well as increasing the raman gain , due to the intensity dependence of the raman gain coefficient on the pump field .",
    "in addition , the equation shows that the threshold scales linearly with the modal volume .",
    "both the coupling and mode volume dependence of the raman threshold are examined experimentally in the next section .",
    "when analyzing the coupling dependence under the assumption of equal raman and pump quality factors and coupling factors , the minimum threshold occurs when @xmath38 or @xmath39 , i.e. in the undercoupled regime with finite waveguide transmission of @xmath40 .",
    "this minimum pump threshold is given by,@xmath41it is worth noting that at this coupling condition , the circulating pump - power in the resonator is not maximum .",
    "this can be understood since minimum threshold represents an optimal balance of both pump coupling and raman mode coupling loss .",
    "the conversion of pump power to raman power above threshold can be characterized by the differential slope efficiency .",
    "the bidirectional  external differential slope efficiency @xmath42 is derived by linearizing the expression for @xmath43 near the threshold condition and is given by , @xmath44        figure 3 shows the differential slope efficiency as a function of coupling strength .",
    "it is noteworthy that it approaches the value of @xmath45 in the limit of strong overcoupling @xmath46 .",
    "surprisingly , this value exceeds unity , indicating that every waveguide pump photon added above threshold , is converted to more than one raman photon .",
    "this result can be understood by again considering the nonlinear dependence of coupled pump power , except this time in the over - coupled regime . in particular , the differential increase in coupled pump power grows more quickly in the overcoupled ( more slowly in the undercoupled regime ) than the differential increase in launched pump power .",
    "this leads to the interesting effect that the differential photon conversion efficiency can exceed unity . taking into account the nonlinear dependence of coupled pump power by defining the internal differential efficiency @xmath47",
    "as the coupled ( as distinct from the launched ) pump - to - raman power , the efficiency approaches , as expected , the value @xmath48 in the limit of strong overcoupling.@xmath49figure 3 shows both the internal and external differential raman conversion efficiencies as a function of coupling strength .      in the ultra - high - q regime ,",
    "resonances of a whispering - gallery - type microcavity are often split into doublets@xcite @xcite",
    ". this splitting is due to coupling of the degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise propagating modes by either intrinsic or surface scattering centers .",
    "the modified coupling properties have been extensively studied kippenbergol . here",
    "we briefly summarize the results of this study and analyze the effect of intermode coupling on raman scattering .",
    "the extent to which intermode coupling modifies the waveguide coupling properties can be described by the dimensionless intermode coupling parameter @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the rate of coupling of the degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise modes .",
    "it is easily measured as the linewidth normalized splitting in the undercoupled regime  ( see figure 4 inset ) .",
    "the presence of intermode coupling has several consequences .",
    "first , the critical point ( as defined by vanishing waveguide transmission ) is shifted towards a coupling point , which , using the conventional coupling terminology , is considered overcoupled as @xmath52the point of vanishing transmission occurs at : @xmath53second , the shifted critical point is accompanied by a maximum reflection into the backwards direction of the waveguide ( i.e. the contra - directional waveguide mode ) . the magnitude of the reflection at the above modified critical point is given by@xmath54third , the leakage of the cavity field into the backwards waveguide direction causes a reduction of the cavity buildup factor with  respect to the ideal case in the absence of intermode coupling . in the limit of strong modal coupling , the cavity buildup factor is reduced by a factor of @xmath55 , which subsequently causes a twofold increase in the threshold necessary to achieve raman lasing .",
    "figure 4 shows the circulating power correction factor @xmath56 as a function of the dimensionless intermode coupling parameter @xmath57 in the presence of modal coupling the waveguide coupling condition for minimum threshold experiences a slight shift towards overcoupling with the maximum shift occurring at @xmath58 . in the regime of very strong modal coupling the condition of minimum raman threshold approaches again the original condition @xmath59 .",
    "the inset shows a frequency scan of a doublet of an ultra - high - q mode.,width=287 ]      the first raman field can itself act as a secondary pump field and generate further raman modes .",

    "the experimental setup in this study is identical to the one reported earlier@xcite and the tapered fiber was attached to a piezoelectric stage which allowed precise control of the taper - microcavity coupling gap ( 20 nm resolution ) and variation of the waveguide - resonator coupling strength .",
    "the q - factors obtained in the microspheres were typically in the range of @xmath72 and taper insertion loss ( fiber to fiber ) was usually less than 5% .             to excite the uhq modes , we used a narrow - linewidth , external - cavity laser emitting in the 1550 nm band . in the case of microspheres , the wgm field spatial forms are known analytically and characterized by the radial , angular , azimuthal and polarization mode number @xmath73 .",

    "toroid microcavities allow on - chip integration of ultra - high - q performance with other optical , mechanical and electrical functionality .",
    "in addition the wafer - scale fabrication process allows precise dimensional control and parallelism .",
    "figure 12 shows a scanning electron microscope of a toroid microcavity .",
    "in addition to the design freedom and control brought about by micro - fabrication and integration possibilities , toroid microcavities also exhibit significant advantages in terms of their raman - emission properties . whereas microsphere cavities show low threshold operation ,",
    "their emission is inherently multi - mode due to the presence of azimuthal modes , as shown in figure 7 of the previous section .",
    "in contrast , toroid microcavities on - a - chip have a significantly reduced mode spectrum , such that _ single mode _ raman lasing can be observed .",
    "the reduced number of azimuthal modes is due to the cavity geometry , which supports only a few modes in the azimuthal direction due to the toroidal confinement@xcite .",
    "figure 13 shows the mode spectrum of a toroid microcavity .",
    "only two higher order modes are present in the spectrum , and successive modes are separated by the free spectral range of the cavity , which in the figure is 10 nm .",
    "this is in contrast to a microsphere of identical principal diameter which would support @xmath109 azimuthal modes weakly split by eccentricity .",
    "diameter toroid microcavity , exhibiting a strongly reduced mode spectrum . the reduced density of modes is due to the encreased azimuthal confinement , and is similar to spectra obtained with spheroids@xcite.,width=287 ]    the suppression of azimuthal modes , has important consequences on the spectral emission properties of single and cascaded raman scattering .",
    "most notably , single transverse mode raman oscillation can be observed over a large range of pump powers .",
    "figure 14 shows a toroid microcavity raman laser , which exhibits single mode oscillation at emission power levels up to 160 @xmath110 with high efficiency ( 45% at the critical point ) .",
    "the single - mode emission property is a significant advantage in practical applications of nonlinear optical oscillators .",
    "diameter toroid microcavity.the pump is located at 1550 nm.,width=287 ]    toroidal and spherical microcavities having similar q and outer diameter will differ in modal volume .",
    "toroids , owing to the added transverse confinement will have a reduced mode volume and hence a lower raman threshold .",
    "the degree to which the threshold is reduced will depend on the `` aspect ratio '' of the toroid or d / d where d is the outer or principal diameter and d is the minor diameter ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "the modal volume of the fundamental toroid mode in a d= 50 @xmath2 toroid plotted versus @xmath111 is provided in figure 15 .",
    "the calculation uses a finite element mode solver as there are no analytical expressions available for toroid mode volume .",
    "the case of d = 50 @xmath2 corresponds to a sphere .",
    "overall , the toroidal mode volume can be seen to be lower than the sphere .",
    "there are also two distinct regimes of mode volume behavior . in the first",
    ", the mode volume reduces very slowly as d is reduced ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this regime features a weak lateral confinement very similar in nature to that of the sphere and related to the gentle transverse curvature of the toroidal dielectric boundary . in the second regime",
    ", the mode volume reduces very quickly as d is reduced .",
    "this regime is characterized by strong , lateral , index confinement resulting from the toroidal boundary being comparable in diameter to the mode field .",
    "the inset to this figure provides mode fields for the toroid in these two regimes to further illustrate this idea .",
    "it is clear that substantial reductions in threshold are possible using these devices .",
    "we are currently characterizing the reductions possible experimentally .    ) .",

    "the inset shows the modeled te - mode intensity distribution for a toroid with 2 @xmath113 and 50 @xmath114 toroid - cross sectional diameter ( d ) using the finite - elements method.,width=287 ]",
    "in summary we have experimentally and theoretically analyzed raman oscillation in fiber - taper - coupled microspheres and microtoroids on - a - chip .",
    "a theoretical analysis was presented using the coupled mode equations for the pump and raman wgms . using these equations , the threshold condition for stimulated raman scattering",
    "was derived and the relative importance of waveguide coupling strength , mode volume and intrinsic resonator q were described .",
    "these theoretical dependences were verified experimentally . furthermore the analysis was extended to the case of cascaded raman oscillation and threshold and efficiency expressions were derived for higher - order raman fields .",
    "this analysis revealed that odd and even order raman lines exhibit different pump - to - raman emission characteristics .",
    "even order stokes fields are found to exhibit a linear increase in generated raman power as a function of pump power , whereas odd - order stokes fields exhibit a square root dependence .",
    "analysis showed and experiment confirmed that the threshold for n - th - order cascaded raman oscillation exhibits a cubic dependence on order and that the associated efficiency of the process scales inverse quadratically with order .",
    "microtoroids , in addition to having significant practical advantages with respect to their chip - based fabrication , have both spectral and power efficiency advantages in comparison to raman oscillation in microspheres .",
    "their stronger lateral confinement provides two distinct benefits .",
    "first , a drastic reduction in the complexity of the mode spectrum enabling single - mode oscillation in the microtoroid based device .",
    "second , a controllable and reduced mode volume so that for comparable q factors , microtoroid devices should have lower threshold pump powers . we are currently investigating the latter advantage experimentally .    the importance of fiber taper coupling in these measurements can not be over emphasized .",
    "these inherently fiber - compatible waveguides provide exceptional coupling efficiencies to and from the ultra - high - q devices .",
    "they are also indispensable in coupling to the microtoroid devices which reside near the surface of a silicon wafer . using taper coupling ,",
    "the lowest threshold observed in this study was 62 @xmath1watts of launched power , a value which is nearly 3-orders of magnitude lower than for free - space illumination of micro - droplets .",
