    "it is now widely accepted that high - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) harbour accreting super - massive black holes implying that their host galaxies are amongst the most massive objects in existence at their respective epochs .",
    "indeed , many studies have now shown that agn preferentially reside within fields containing over - densities of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "together these points support the idea that agn can be utilized as signposts to extreme regions of the dark matter density and thus the most massive dark matter haloes ( e.g. @xcite ) at any given epoch . combining this technique with large multiwavelength surveys , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) which has identified up to 100000 broad - line quasi - stellar objects ( hereafter quasars ) up to the highest measured redshifts",
    "( i.e. z=6.4 , @xcite ) , has opened up a new era in agn research .",
    "many authors have addressed the question of whether the environments of radio - loud agn , such as radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) or radio galaxies ( rgs ) , are any different from those of radio - quiet agn , such as radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , with conflicting results .",
    "the first work that compared directly the environments of rlqs and rqqs was @xcite , in which a marginally more significant over - density was detected around the rlqs in their sample of objects at @xmath5 .",
    "however , a later improved study with more data and refined techniques removed the significance of this result @xcite",
    ". more work on the topic was conducted by @xcite who added more faint rqqs to the @xcite sample . as a result they reported a significant difference in the environments preferred by rlqs and rqqs , with rqqs in general preferring poorer environments at the 99  per cent confidence level . at @xmath6 @xcite",
    "found that rlqs occupied more dense environments in the near - infrared than rqqs .",
    "in contrast , both @xcite and @xcite found the environments of rlqs and rqqs to be indistinguishable at z@xmath70.2 and at @xmath8 respectively .",
    "more recently found that radio - loud agn reside in environments a factor of @xmath9 more dense than radio - quiet agn in a large matched sample of sdss emission - line agn in the local universe .",
    "these results present us with a very mixed picture .",
    "however , it is probable that many of them suffer in some way from small number statistics and/or significant selection effects .",
    "furthermore , it may be crucial to understand how the agn and their environments are linked at all redshifts given that large - scale radio - jet activity could enhance ( @xcite ) or truncate ( ) star formation on the mpc scale , and hence be a crucial ingredient in semi - analytic models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is still not clear exactly what triggers the radio emission we see in radio - loud agn , and why we do not see similar emission in otherwise comparable radio - quiet agn",
    ". showed that , on average , rlqs have 45  per cent more massive black holes than rqqs , and that most rlqs have a black - hole mass greater than @xmath10 .",
    "these results suggest that in order to be radio - loud an agn requires a certain mass of black hole .",
    "however , at any given black - hole mass the range of radio luminosities spans several orders of magnitude and there are rqqs which have black holes equally as massive as the rlqs .",
    "thus black - hole mass can not be the only factor that determines radio power ; perhaps the environment of the agn also contributes .",
    "it is also still not fully understood whether there is a true agn radio power dichotomy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; and more recently @xcite ; ) , and whether the different types of agn are intrinsically different or whether we just happen to be observing some whilst they are going through a period of radio - loudness .",
    "studying the cluster - scale environments of these objects provides a good means of investigating this issue since , if they are identical objects going through different phases then they should have similar environments on these scales .",
    "alternatively , it may be the case that the environment is in some way linked to the differences that we see in the radio properties of agn .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on a number density analysis of a sample of 173 agn fields at the single cosmic epoch of @xmath11 , splitting the agn into their classical types ( rlqs , rqqs and rgs ) , as well as looking for trends with radio luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "we use 3.6  @xmath1 m observations allowing us to sample the peak of the rest - frame stellar spectrum thus maximising our sensitivity to stellar mass .",
    "this work presents an analysis of the environments of the largest , most uniformly selected sample of luminous agn yet assembled at high redshift . in so doing it forms an extension to previous studies of the environments of agn with lower radio luminosities and at lower redshifts ( @xmath12 ) performed with sdss data ( e.g. @xcite ; ) .    in section 2",
    "we give details of our data , in section 3 we discuss the source extraction , in section 4 we explain the method of analysis , then in section 5 we present our results followed by a discussion in section 6 and a summary of the main conclusions in section 7 . throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed a flat cosmology with h@xmath13 km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system .    .",
    "the data presented in this paper consist of infrared images of 173 agn taken at 3.6  @xmath1 m with the irac camera on - board the _ spitzer space telescope_. the sample is split into three sub - samples , all at the single cosmic epoch of @xmath17 : 75 rlqs , 71 rqqs and 27 rgs .",
    "this redshift was chosen as it is the minimum at which there is a large enough population of high - luminosity quasars to allow comparison with the bright quasars that are observed at higher redshifts . at this redshift",
    "the sdss allows us to sample over 5 magnitudes in quasar optical luminosity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss ] ) .",
    "this sample thus enables us to decouple luminosity generated effects from evolutionary ones , something which has plagued many other flux density limited studies in this area .",
    "in addition , the targets were chosen to have redshifts optimized , within the chosen range for follow - up co surveys with interferometers such as the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "observing both unobscured ( type-1 ) agn , in the form of quasars , and obscured ( type-2 ) agn , the rgs , allows us to test agn unification schemes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "full details of the quasars will be presented elsewhere ( jarvis et al .",
    ", in prep ) while a list of the rgs giving their main properties is given in table [ tab : rgs ] .",
    "the rgs properties are taken from nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , except for the 6c objects where the redshifts are taken from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the 6c * and toot objects which are described by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "further details of the rgs will be presented elsewhere ( fernandes et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    ".the radio galaxies used in this paper .",
    "column 2 gives the observed - frame 325  mhz flux density , column 3 the spectral index and column 4 the redshift .",
    "the 325  mhz flux densities and spectral indices ( @xmath18 ) are calculated by fitting a power - law through available flux density measurements taken from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , except for 6c * and toot objects which are not listed in ned , see text for details .",
    "the errors associated with the flux densities are typically a few per cent . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      having upper limits for the rqq radio power ( see section  [ section : sample ] ) allows us to investigate the environmental densities of all our agn as a function of radio luminosity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation_density ] ) .",
    "since the rgs are not selected in the same way as the quasars , caution must be exercised in their inclusion in this analysis .",
    "it is also worth noting the size of the error bars on the over - density in these figures , as shown by the mean error bar ( @xmath19 arcmin@xmath20 ) .",
    "this explains the large scatter on any correlation .",
    "the censored data ( e.g. the rqq upper limits ) require that we use survival analysis techniques for our correlation analysis .",
    "we therefore used iraf which provides three types of test : the spearman rank order test , the generalized kendall s tau test and the cox proportional hazard model .",
    "all three tests can handle one type of limit in the dependent variable , in our case upper limits in the radio luminosity .",
    "the results of the correlation analysis are shown in table  [ tab : correlation ] . with the exception of the cox proportional hazard model the tests give evidence for a correlation at the @xmath21  per cent confidence level when all agn are included .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to those sources that have radio luminosities above the traditional separation between fri and frii radio sources at log@xmath22 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at this threshold",
    "there is also a divergence in the space - density evolution with redshift , with the higher luminosity radio sources tending to evolve more strongly than the lower luminosity sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for this sample we again obtain correlation at the @xmath21 per cent level .",
    "however , if we employ a much more conservative low - luminosity cut - off of log@xmath23 which ensures that all of our sources lie well within the frii rgime then we find that the correlation is significant at the @xmath24 per cent level .",
    "intriguingly , in the high radio luminosity range the rlqs and rgs appear to show the same trend of increasing source over - density with radio luminosity , as would be expected in the unified scheme @xcite .",
    "this improvement in the correlation analysis results for high radio luminosity could of course be a real effect or instead it might be a result of foreground / background contamination in some of the low - radio luminosity agn causing them to appear more over - dense than they actually are .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite finds that the environmental densities of rlqs and radio - loud agn ( i.e. rgs ) match only for radio luminosities of log@xmath25 ( after converting into appropriate units ) .",
    "their interpretation is that the unified scheme for radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies might only be valid for high radio luminosities .",
    "finally , we note with interest that @xcite also report a similar trend to that found here of increasing environmental density with radio luminosity for rlqs .",
    "our results indicate that , on average , agn at @xmath11 have 2 to 3 massive ( @xmath26 ) galaxies containing a substantial evolved stellar population in their @xmath27  kpc - scale environments , representing an over - density relative to the field .",
    "moreover , we find evidence that the radio emission we observe from agn is in some way related to the galaxy density in its environment .",
    "specifically , we find that the rlqs and rgs occupy more dense environments than the rqqs . secondly , if we ignore agn classification and simply measure the over - density as a function of radio luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation_density ] ) we find evidence of a positive correlation between the two ( table  [ tab : correlation ] ) .",
    "initially one might expect that these results could be due to the radio - loud objects having intrinsically larger black hole masses than their radio - quiet counterparts .",
    "indeed , recent work has found evidence for this to be the case ( e.g. ) .",
    "if we then assume that the largest black holes reside in the largest dark matter haloes , or are found closer to the centre of their haloes , they would thus also have the highest density environments . however , when we compare our results to the quasar black hole mass estimates we find that the black - hole masses of the rlqs and rqqs are statistically indistinguishable",
    ". moreover , the over - density around the quasars shows no significant trend with black - hole mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation_density ] ) using a correlation analysis ( table  [ tab : correlation ] ) .    at this point",
    "it is worth considering whether there might be a systematic bias in the way our black - hole mass estimates are made for the radio - loud and radio - quiet subsets .",
    "for example , if the eddington ratios are for some reason systematically lower for the radio - loud objects then they must host more massive black - holes to produce a given optical luminosity .",
    "one possibility is that radio - loud objects are powered by a radiatively inefficient accretion process such as bondi accretion of the hot phase of the igm ( e.g. @xcite ) while the radio - quiet objects are accreting cold gas in the standard manner .",
    "however , such a possibility is easily dismissed since radiatively inefficient accretion processes can only explain the multi - wavelength properties of low - excitation radio sources which are almost all fanaroff - riley ( fr ) class i objects whereas our entire sample is made up of qsos , with the radio - loud objects all having radio luminosities typical of fr ii sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radiol_z ] ) .",
    "furthermore , given that our samples are matched in absolute optical magnitude and optical colours , any difference in accretion properties must contrive to produce a distribution of mgiiline widths that would lead to identical black - hole mass distributions ; this seems unlikely .",
    "therefore we are led to conclude that the environments of the agn are somehow affecting the differences we observe in their radio properties .",
    "this is one of two possible scenarios that could explain our results , the other being that the agns radio emission is influencing the environmental density .",
    "however , this is a much harder scenario to envisage as the @xmath7100 kpc - scale radio jets would need to influence galaxy formation on mpc scales .",
    "it is known that tidal stripping would be more prevalent in denser environments , as more close encounters or mergers with other galaxies would occur . the inter - galactic medium ( igm )",
    "would therefore be denser in regions of higher galaxy density .",
    "a higher igm density gives more material for radio jets to work on , increasing the radio luminosity produced through synchrotron losses .",
    "this effect , known as jet confinement , was discussed by who use it to explain the unusually steep far - infrared to radio spectral slope of cygnus a as boosting of the radio luminosity caused by a higher environmental density .",
    "the estimated enhancement in radio luminosity for agn in clusters , compared to the field , was given by as @xmath28 orders of magnitude which might be sufficient to explain our results , although a realistic physical model is clearly required .",
    "in the local universe find a similar difference in matched samples of radio - loud and radio - quiet emission line agn from sdss ; they also offer an explanation in terms of radio jets being enhanced in denser environments .",
    "our results extend this relationship to higher luminosity objects at higher redshifts .",
    "the idea of jet confinement may be able to explain the results for the rgs and rlqs . whether this idea can be extended to the rqqs , which typically have radio emission at least an order of magnitude lower than the rlqs , is less clear .",
    "classically in unified schemes , rqqs are thought of as the quasars without kpc - scale radio jets , implying that they are physically different to rlqs . however , there is some evidence in the literature to suggest that the radio properties of rqqs and rlqs are not so very different ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "it has been suggested though , that the use of the first survey , which is not sensitive to extended radio emission , may in fact have been responsible for these findings ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite detect kpc - scale radio jets around 34  per cent of a sample of 27 rqqs .",
    "if this is representative of the whole rqq population then perhaps the classical view is no longer valid and there is infact more of a continuum of quasar radio properties .",
    "this certainly makes the source of the radio emission from agn easier to understand , as explaining a dichotomy in their properties is difficult . in our sample",
    ", there is definitely a gap in the radio luminosities of our quasars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radiol_z ] ) in the sense that the rqq upper limits are typically an order of magnitude below the least radio - loud rlqs .",
    "this effect is , however , intrinsic to our sample , since we have used different surveys which have different depths to define the rlq and rqq sub - samples .",
    "therefore this is not suggestive of a radio power dichotomy in the quasar population although at the same time it is not evidence that there is not one .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the differences we observe in agn radio properties are caused by the spin states of their black - holes .",
    "this is certainly plausible as it could much more readily explain a radio power dichotomy , if indeed it turns out that there is one .",
    "it could also explain our results if for some reason the spin is affected by the environmental density .",
    "this idea is mentioned in the literature and usually takes the form of black holes spinning faster in dense environments due to increased exposure to mergers , which spin up the black hole ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the one major problem with black hole spin as an explanation is that it is as yet not observationally measurable in agn and so the hypothesis is not yet testable .",
    "we have conducted an analysis of the environments of a large sample of agn at @xmath11 in order to study the relationship between agn activity and environmental density at an epoch close to the peak in agn activity .",
    "our main conclusion are :    1 .",
    "the agn fields show , on average , an excess above the field of 2 to 3 massive galaxies containing a substantial evolved stellar population .",
    "most of this over - density is confined within a radius of @xmath2  kpc of the agn although there is good evidence for a lower level over - density extending out to the mpc - scale .",
    "2 .   we find evidence for a trend of increasing galaxy over - density with increasing agn radio luminosity .",
    "since the rlqs and rqqs have indistinguishable black hole mass distributions the observed difference in environmental density is not a result of observing different populations of objects .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the radio power of an agn is in some way influenced by the environmental density in which it resides .",
    "our results could be explained by the boosting of radio jets in areas of higher igm density which are known to exist in galaxy - dense regions due to mergers and tidal stripping of galaxy gas .",
    "it is unclear whether this explanation can be extended to the rqqs in our sample .",
    "it is of course entirely possible that the radio properties of agn are not determined by a single parameter but instead a combination of parameters .",
    "it is clear from previous work that for an agn to be radio - loud it requires a certain mass of black hole ( ) but this can not be the only factor involved .",
    "this work and that of others ( e.g. and @xcite ) suggests that there is some link between radio - loudness and the environment as well , and there have been several theoretical papers proposing that black hole spin could also be responsible .",
    "future observations , such as deep radio observations with the low - frequency array ( lofar ) , will allow us to investigate the environments as a function of radio luminosity well down into the radio - quiet quasar rgime and up to higher redshifts , and place firmer constraints on our conclusions based on this sample alone .",
