    "_ intruder boundary conditions _ : here , we give a detailed description of the boundary conditions at the intruder . to model frictionless interaction between grains and the rigid circular intruder ,",
    "we constrain a ring of nodes representing the intruder boundary to move along but not through the circular boundary .",
    "this boundary condition is achieved by first creating a reference point for the intruder at its center and then specifying that the distance between the reference point and nodes on the circular intruder boundary remain fixed through use of a link - type multi - point - constraint in abaqus @xcite .",
    "then , either the intruder speed @xmath42 or the force @xmath43 is applied directly to the reference point associated with the intruder .",
    "while the intruder boundary is specified to be mechanically rigid and frictionless , the domain in which we solve the governing equations includes the intruder , so as to circumvent the need for an extra fluidity boundary condition .",
    "we have also performed additional calculations using a @xmath45 fluidity boundary condition at the intruder boundary as well as calculations with a mechanically rough intruder ( results not shown ) .",
    "we observe no qualitative change in the simulated results in either case , indicating that the results reported in the letter are robust .",
    "that is to say , the model is capable of capturing the phenomenology of mechanically - induced creep regardless of the details of the specified intruder boundary conditions .",
    "_ nonlocal amplitude @xmath27 for a two - dimensional setting _ :",
    "the nonlocal amplitude @xmath27 is a crucial material parameter in the nonlocal rheology , setting the widths of shear bands in the rate - independent limit . in our past work @xcite",
    ", we found that a value of @xmath83 provided an excellent description of three - dimensional flows of glass beads ; however , we expect that a different quantitative value will be appropriate for our effective two - dimensional calculations .",
    "since we are using the rod creep experiments of reddy et al.@xcite as a guide in our calculations ( for example , in our choice of geometry ) , we use their annular shear experiments ( see their fig.1(b ) ) to guide our selection of @xmath27 .",
    "we perform simulations of two - dimensional annular shear with _ no intruder_. the annular cell has rough walls at inner radius @xmath32 and outer radius @xmath33 . as in all the calculations in this letter ,",
    "the inner wall is specified to rotate at a fixed rate @xmath34 , which gives rise to a wall - located shear band , and the outer wall does not rotate but may move radially so as to impart a confining pressure @xmath35 . following reddy et al.@xcite , we take @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; however , the value of @xmath33 does not affect calculation results .",
    "we find that a normalized inner wall speed of @xmath75 is sufficiently slow so as to yield a rate - independent result .",
    "the calculated flow field is tangentially symmetric , and the steady - state tangential velocity field @xmath84 , normalized by the inner wall speed @xmath85 , is plotted in fig.[figs01 ] as a solid line .",
    "we have selected @xmath50 so that the calculated result matches the experiments of reddy et al.@xcite ( plotted as points in fig.[figs01 ] ) .      , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 and ( a ) @xmath90 , ( b ) 24 , and ( c ) 18 .",
    "simulated creep data are shown as symbols , and the dashed line represents the drag force versus intruder velocity relation when the inner wall is fixed ( @xmath51 ) . ]    _ mesh sensitivity study _ : it is important to verify that our finite - element calculation results do not depend on the mesh resolution . to this end , we reconsider all calculation results for the @xmath68 geometry with two mesh resolutions . for the `` coarse '' mesh ,",
    "we take a mesh resolution of @xmath91 at the intruder boundary with a total of 77121 elements , and the `` fine '' mesh has a resolution of @xmath92 at the the intruder boundary and a total of 106212 elements .",
    "we first repeat the rod dragging calculations for both meshes , plotted in fig.[figs02](a ) .",
    "fine mesh results are plotted with a @xmath86 and coarse mesh results with a @xmath87 .",
    "the results are indistinguishable , and both yield a rate - independent plateau of @xmath93 . the creep speed as a function of normalized inner wall speed for @xmath67 is shown in fig.[figs02](b ) , and again , the results for the two meshes are indistinguishable , both demonstrating nominal rate - independence indicated by the dashed line .",
    "finally , the intruder creep speed as a function of applied force for @xmath75 is shown in fig.[figs02](c ) , also demonstrating mesh insensitivity .",
    "_ additional simulated creep data _ : in the letter , we reported rod creep calculations for @xmath56 , 24 , and 34 and @xmath75 . here",
    "we show the full results of our rod creep simulations in fig.[figs03 ] .",
    "figure [ figs03](a ) shows the intruder creep speed as a function of the applied force in the range @xmath94 for three different inner wall speeds and @xmath90 .",
    "figures [ figs03](b ) and ( c ) show the same results for @xmath68 and 18 .",
    "rate - independent behavior is evident for @xmath95 and for all inner wall speeds and intruder locations considered here .",
    "when the inner wall speed is increased by a decade , the intruder creep speed correspondingly increases by a decade in this range . for @xmath96 ,",
    "all data begin to converge and asymptotically approach the drag force versus intruder velocity relation when the inner wall is fixed ( dashed line ) .",
    "this transition indicates an increased role of the material time scale @xmath70 and a dominance of the local rheology in the observed response .",
    "it bears noting that the convergence of the data around @xmath97 is consistent with the experimental observations of reddy et al.@xcite",
    ". however , our calculations are quantitatively different .",
    "while the data for different @xmath41 converge precisely at @xmath97 in the experiments , the transition is more diffuse in our calculations .",
    "we speculate that the quantitative differences in the transition are due to the two - dimensional setting of the simulations compared to the three - dimensional nature of the experiments .    _ potential explanations for exponential - type behavior relating force and creep - rate _ : we have arrived at two preliminary explanations for why the relationship between force and creep - rate bears and exponential - type shape when @xmath76 .",
    "these are not mutually exclusive  both could be taking place together  but they remain somewhat speculative at this stage .",
    "the difficulty in constructing such an argument is related to the fact that although this geometry is simple to the eye , it develops complex two - dimensional fields , and reducing these in a way that can be understood with simple mathematical arguments is actually quite non - trivial .",
    "while it is certainly true that the local fluidity source that develops ahead of the intruder gives rise to non - linear behavior , which we discuss in the main body of the text , the arguments below could shed light on why an exponential - type appearance arises in the process .",
    "a tool in developing these explanations is the integral representation of fluidity solutions .",
    "given a stress field , fluidity solutions can be expressed through the body - integral @xmath98 where @xmath99 $ ] is a green function for eq.3 in the main text , arising as a global functional operator on @xmath100 .",
    "the helmoltz - type nature of the fluidity pde causes the green function to decay in an exponential fashion , which causes fluidity solutions to exponentially decay away from sources of local fluidity . for instructive purposes , note that in one - dimension of space and for @xmath101 , the infinite - space green function obeys @xmath102 .    the first explanation for the exponential dependence of the intruder creep relates to the stress - dependence of @xmath103 , and how increasing the intruder - force slows the rate of fluidity decay between the objects .",
    "as noted above , the decay length of the green function is not a constant , but given by the stress through @xmath104 , with @xmath103 increasing with @xmath12 ( when @xmath79 ) . increasing the force on the rod directly increases the @xmath12 field between the rotating wall and the intruder . in the large zone of @xmath78 between the objects ,",
    "this increase in @xmath12 directly increases @xmath103 , which slows the rate of exponential decay of the fluidity between the two objects .",
    "this logic could then explain why the fluidity at the intruder gains an exponential dependence on the intruder - force .",
    "the second explanation relates to how forcing on the intruder brings the sources of fluidity about the two objects closer together in space . as force on the rod increases , it causes @xmath12 to increase in a decaying fashion away from the intruder , as we previously discussed . in so doing",
    ", there will be some growth of the region of local fluidity about the intruder and also about the inner wall .",
    "zones of local fluidity are a source term in the body - integral above , and due to the exponential behavior of the green s function , if two sources of fluidity get closer , the fluidity values at the two locations increase exponentially .",
    "consequently , this effect could be at the heart of the exponential dependence of creep - rate on the intruder - force .",
    "we reiterate that these are still preliminary explanations .",
    "we can not claim that either effect will produce a perfect exponential , due to intricacies of the stress field that have been handled only qualitatively in the arguments just made .",
    "see supplemental material for a detailed discussion of the intruder boundary conditions , a justification of our choice of @xmath27 , a mesh sensitivity study , additional simulated creep data , and explanations for exponential creep - rate behavior ."

    "<S> cooperativity is a hallmark of quasi - static , dense granular deformation . at a microscopic level , </S>",
    "<S> deformation in granular materials takes place through the rearrangement of clusters of grains . </S>",
    "<S> these rearrangement events lead to long - range fluctuations , or agitations , that influence the behavior of nearby clusters , leading to macroscopic manifestations of cooperativity , which are quite varied . </S>",
    "<S> most familiarly , the length - scales associated with velocity fields in dense granular flows depend crucially upon the grain size @xcite , with grain - size dependent shear band widths being observed in many geometries @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . other manifestations of cooperativity include the dependence of volumetric outflow rate on grain size in drainage flows @xcite and the so - called @xmath0-effect , in which thin granular layers require greater tilt to flow down an inclined surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more recently - observed example of cooperativity in dense granular flows is that of mechanically - induced creep @xcite , understood as follows . when an intruder , such as a sphere , rod , or vane , is placed in a dense granular material </S>",
    "<S> , one must apply a force to the intruder that exceeds a critical value in order to move it through the granular media . </S>",
    "<S> however , shear deformation far from the intruder enables it to move , or creep , through the granular media for any non - zero value of the applied force  even when this force is less than the critical value . that is to say , flow anywhere in a granular media erases the yield condition everywhere !    these cooperative phenomena provide stringent tests for a continuum model of granular flow . </S>",
    "<S> local approaches to continuum modeling of granular materials , such as granular rheology @xcite or soil mechanics @xcite , which relate the stress at a point to the local strain , strain - rate , or locally evolved state variables , are not equipped to address size - dependent manifestations of cooperativity . recently , we proposed a nonlocal rheology for dense granular flows , capable of modeling size - effects @xcite , based on work in the emulsions community @xcite , which we briefly summarize here . </S>",

    "<S> mathematically , it functions as a field variable that relates the load intensity @xmath12 to the consequent flow rate @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 , so that the tensorial relation between the cauchy stress and the strain rate is @xmath15 where we have made the common assumption that the strain - rate and deviatoric cauchy stress tensors are codirectional @xcite , though this is an approximation @xcite . in a local description of granular flow , </S>",
    "<S> the fluidity is constitutively given as a function of the stress , in a manner consistent with bagnold scaling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simple dimensional analysis applied to the case of homogeneous simple shearing produces a one - to - one relationship between the stress ratio @xmath12 and a dimensionless version of the strain rate called the inertial number @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean grain diameter and @xmath18 is the grain material density . </S>",

    "<S> this nonlocal model was demonstrated to accurately describe flow fields and shear - band widths in numerous granular flow experiments in several distinct flow configurations @xcite . while also a manifestation of cooperativity in granular materials , the problem of mechanically - induced creep is distinctly different from the previously - addressed problems , as it probes the nonlocality of strength rather than flow and contains a crucial non - kinematic boundary condition , i.e. , the intruder force . as such , it is the purpose of this letter to demonstrate that our model is capable of capturing this phenomenology .    </S>",

    "<S> ( the vanishing of the yield condition was also seen in the experiments of @xcite and @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> importantly , several experimental observations were made about the creep phenomenology : ( 1 ) for sufficiently low inner wall speeds , mechanically - induced creep is a rate - independent process , i.e. , the rod creep speed is linearly proportional to the inner wall speed . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the rod creep speed increases exponentially with the force applied to the intruder . ( 3 ) </S>",
    "<S> the rod creeps faster when it is placed closer to the inner wall shear band .        in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we apply our nonlocal model to the problem of mechanically - induced creep , using finite - element calculations in the commercial package abaqus / standard @xcite . for computational efficiency </S>",

    "<S> the inner wall is then moved at a fixed speed in a tangential direction which opposes the force applied to the intruder ( see fig.[fig01 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> near the inner wall , away from the intruder , the fluidity field is essentially the same in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the region of the intruder , the stronger source in the higher force case leads to a local fluidity which is approximately six times greater  or equivalently a viscosity which is six times less . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease in viscosity combined with the greater applied force leads to the faster than linear increase in creep speed with force observed in fig.[fig04 ] .     in the region of the intruder during steady creep for @xmath67 and 0.95 , @xmath68 , and @xmath75 . </S>",
