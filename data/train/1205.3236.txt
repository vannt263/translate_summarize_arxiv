    "the set of implications @xmath4 is called _ optimum _ , when @xmath6 is minimum among all possible sets of implications defining convex geometry .    in this paper",
    "we address the following question : _ if a convex geometry is given by a set of implications @xmath4 , is it possible to find its optimum basis @xmath7 in time polynomially dependable on @xmath6 ? _",
    "d.  maier @xcite showed that the problem of finding the optimum basis is np - complete , thus , the question above most likely is answered in negative . on the other hand , some special classes of closure systems may have tractable optimum bases .",
    "these are , for example , closure systems with the modular closure lattices , as shown by m. wild @xcite , or quasi - acyclic closure systems , as shown by p. l. hammer and a. kogan @xcite .",
    "note that the latter paper deals with horn boolean functions and their optimal cnf - representation , and there are several varitions of optimization parameters .",
    "this is further discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate three important sub - classes of convex geometries where the tractable optimum basis exists : one is the class of geometries satisfying the @xmath8-carousel property , the other is presented by order convex subsets of posets , and the last is convex geometries without @xmath2-cycles .",
    "if the first class includes all _ affine _ convex geometries , the last one is the generalization of _ acyclic _ closure systems of p.l .",
    "hammer and a. kogan @xcite , @xmath9-_geometries _ of m. wild @xcite and ( dual ) supersolvable anti - matroids of d.  armstrong @xcite .",
    "we show that a convex geometry without @xmath2-cycles has the tractable optimum basis , which is exactly @xmath10-basis defined in @xcite .",
    "we note that all three classes differ from another tractable class , @xmath11 closure systems , that generalize quasi - acyclic closure systems , see e. boros et al @xcite .",

    "i.e. @xmath15    in this paper we consider only _ finite _ convex geometries , i.e. geometries with @xmath16 .",
    "it is worth noting that convex geometries are always _ standard _ closure systems , i.e. they satisfy property    @xmath17    this condition , in particular , implies @xmath18 , whenever @xmath19 , for any @xmath20 .    very often , a convex geometry is given by its collection of closed sets .",
    "there is a convenient description of those collections of subsets of a given finite set @xmath9 , which are , in fact , the closed sets of a convex geometry on @xmath9 : if @xmath21 satisfies + ( 1 ) @xmath22 ; + ( 2 ) @xmath23 , as soon as @xmath24 ; + ( 3 ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 implies @xmath27 , for some @xmath28 , + then @xmath29 represents the collection of closed sets of a convex geometry @xmath30 .    as for any closure system , the closed sets of convex geometry form a lattice , which is usually called the _ closure lattice _ and denoted @xmath31 .",
    "the closure lattices of convex geometries have various characterizations , and are usually called _ locally distributive _ in the lattice literature .    a reader can be referred to @xcite,@xcite and @xcite for the further details of combinatorial and lattice - theoretical aspects of finite convex geometries .    if @xmath32 , then this relation between subsets @xmath33 in a closure system can be written in the form of implication : @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the closure system @xmath35 can be given by the set of implications : @xmath36    the set @xmath37 is called the _ premise _ , and @xmath38 the _ conclusion _ of an implication @xmath39 .",
    "we will assume that any implication @xmath39 is an ordered pair of non - empty subsets @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "conversely , any set of implications @xmath4 defines a closure system : the closed sets are exactly subsets @xmath42 that _ respect _ the implications from @xmath4 , i.e. , if @xmath34 is in @xmath4 , and @xmath43 , then @xmath44 .",
    "there are numerous ways to represent the same closure system by sets of implications ; those sets of implications with some minimality property are called _",
    "bases_. thus we can speak of various sorts of bases .    as in @xcite , we will call subset @xmath45 of given basis @xmath4 the _ binary part _ of the basis . since every convex geometry @xmath46 is a standard closure system , the binary relation @xmath47 on @xmath9 defined as :",
