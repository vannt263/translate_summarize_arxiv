    "numerical path integral methods have proved to be highly useful tools in the analysis of finite temperature , many - body quantum systems.@xcite a central theme in such studies is the conscious use of dimensionality , both in the reformulation of the original problem and in the subsequent numerical simulations .",
    "as the scale of the problems under study continues to grow , it becomes increasingly important that the formal properties of the numerical methods that are utilized be properly characterized .",
    "recently , predescu and co - workers@xcite have presented a number of results concerning the convergence properties of random series - based path integral techniques .",
    "important in their own right , these formal properties have also led to the development of a new class of path integral methods , the so - called reweighted techniques.@xcite reweighted approaches accelerate the convergence of `` primitive '' series methods by including the effects of `` higher - order '' path variables in a simple , approximate fashion .",
    "reweighted methods achieve the convergence rate of related partial averaging approaches@xcite without requiring the construction of the gaussian transform of the underlying potential energy function .",
    "previous work on the reweighted method has focused principally on the construction of the quantum - mechanical density matrix.@xcite in the present work , we wish to examine estimators for various coordinate - diagonal and off - diagonal properties .",
    "while the present discussion is focused principally on reweighted methods , the results obtained are broadly applicable to more general random series approaches .    in section ii of the present article",
    ", we examine the thermodynamic ( t - method ) and direct ( h - method ) estimators for the total energy . in order to avoid any confusion with earlier estimators",
    ", we mention that in the present article by t - method and h - method estimators we understand the respective energy estimators introduced by predescu and doll in ref .  .",
    "thus , the t - method estimator we employ does not have the variance difficulties associated with the barker estimator for large numbers of path variables.@xcite as the low - temperature simulation presented in the second part of the article demonstrates , the present t - method estimator does not exhibit any of the difficulties sometimes associated with the virial estimator for low - temperature systems or for strongly correlated monte carlo sampling techniques.@xcite the t - method estimator is closely related and similar in form to the centroid virial estimator.@xcite we expect the two estimators to have similar behavior with the nature of the quantum system , the temperature , and the monte carlo sampling method",
    ". however , an important difference between the two estimators is the fact that the t - method estimator is a veritable thermodynamic estimator , in the sense that it is obtained by temperature differentiation of the quantum partition function .",
    "this observation is important because the temperature differentiation can be implemented numerically by a finite - difference scheme and , in principle , may lead to numerically stable algorithms that do not require derivatives of the potential . for large dimensional systems or systems described by complicated potentials , we expect such algorithms to be significantly faster than those based on explicit analytical formulas .",
    "the relative merits of such algorithms will be examined in future work .    in section iii",
    ", we examine the application of the reweighted methods to a model problem , that of simulating the thermodynamic properties of the ( h@xmath0 molecular cluster .",
    "in section iv , we summarize our present findings and clarify a number of issues raised in previous studies of this molecular hydrogen system.@xcite",
    "in this section , we consider a one - dimensional quantum canonical system characterized by inverse temperature @xmath1 and set forward the task of computing its average energy by monte carlo integration methods developed around several reweighted techniques.@xcite the physical system is made up of a particle of mass @xmath2 moving in the potential @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss the numerical implementation and the computational merits of both the t - method and h - method estimators .",
    "any time the multidimensional extension is not obvious , we present the explicit formulas of the respective estimators .    we begin by presenting the general form of the path integral methods we employ in this paper .",

    "we have employed the estimator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) and the path estimator , respectively .",
    "these were shown to produce values identical to the point estimator but have the variance of the path estimator .",
    "for the rw - wfpi and rw - lcpi methods , the point and the path estimators produce different results . due to the very design of the reweighted techniques ,",
    "we have argued that the point estimator results should be the more accurate ones .",
    "this theoretical prediction is well supported by the values presented in tables  [ table : rw - wfpi ] and  [ table : rw - lcpi ] .    while we have argued that the h - method estimator is a better estimator as value ( but not necessarily as variance ) than the t - method estimator for the reweighted methods , it is apparent from table  [ table : lc - ttpi ] that the same difference persists for the trapezoidal trotter scheme . as discussed before , for the tt - dpi method",
    ", the point and path estimators provide the same value for the average potential .",
    "as opposed to the reweigthed techniques , the h - method kinetic estimator is less accurate than the t - method kinetic energy estimator . quite interestingly , even if individually the potential and the kinetic parts are more accurate for the t - method estimator , it is the h - method energy estimator that provides a more accurate total energy .",
    "clearly , a strong compensation of errors appears in the case of the h - method estimator .",
    "such a compensation of errors is generally characteristic of variational methods . in this",
    "respect , notice that the tt - dpi density matrices are positive definite because they are obtained by lie - trotter composing a certain symmetrical short - time approximation . by the ritz variational principle",
    ", the h - method energy estimator can not have a value smaller than the ground - state energy .",
    "thus , the ritz variational principle provides some control on the values of the h - method estimator , but not on the individual components , nor on the t - method estimator .",
    "the rw - lcpi density matrices are also positive definite for @xmath259 and indeed , the energy provided by the h - method estimator is still better than what the values of the potential and kinetic parts suggest . while a final resolution awaits further study , it is apparent that this finding is not related to the asymptotic rate of convergence of the path integral technique .    among the three methods presented , the rw - wfpi has the fastest convergence for all properties studied .",
    "moreover , for @xmath260 and @xmath261 , there is a good agreement ( within statistical noise ) between the t- and the h - method energy estimators , as well as between their potential and kinetic energy components . for @xmath261 ,",
    "one concludes that the systematic error is smaller than the statistical error for all properties computed . an additional rw - wfpi simulation with @xmath178 in @xmath200 million monte carlo passes has produced results consistent with the findings above .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] and represent the energy values we report .",
    ".estimated energies in k / molecule for the @xmath146 cluster computed with the help of the wiener - fourier reweighted technique using @xmath262 path variables and @xmath200 million monte carlo passes . listed",

    "the reported errors are two standard deviations .",

    "in the present work we have considered a number of issues related to the choice of estimators for random series path integral methods . we have illustrated our results by applying them to the problem of computing various thermodynamic properties of a model of the ( h@xmath266 cluster using reweighted path integral techniques .",
    "the molecular hydrogen cluster is a strongly quantum mechanical system and is representative of the type of problems one is likely to encounter in many applications .",
    "hence , it constitutes a useful benchmark for present and future path integral techniques and for this reason it is important that its physical properties be determined within advertized statistical error bars .",
    "path integral methods capable of dealing with such highly quantum - mechanical systems in an efficient manner are needed , both for reliable determinations of the physical properties of the respective systems as well as for accurate parameterizations of the intermolecular potentials .",
    "we wish to make a number of points concerning the present results and the methods we have utilized to obtain them . at a more general level",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the reweighted path integral methods discussed here provide a broadly applicable , simple , and formally well characterized set of techniques . as demonstrated by the present results , they are capable of producing high - quality numerical results for problems of appreciable physical complexity . moreover , they do so without the assumption of a particular form for the underlying microscopic forces .",
    "furthermore , the estimators described in the present paper are convenient , accurate , and easily implemented for any random series approach . as discussed in section iii , when used together , the t and h - method estimators provide an important consistency check on the quality of the path integral simulations . such consistency checks",
    "are a valuable element in judging the reliability of particular simulations .",
    "as previously mentioned , the cluster application discussed here provides a convenient test bed for the development of numerical methods . for this reason",
    ", we have exercised due diligence with respect to the quality of our final results summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "as discussed in section iii , we have subjected both the parallel random number generator employed and the numerical results obtained to a series of quality - control tests . beyond these statistical checks , it is important to note there is an internal consistency check on the quality of the present results .",
    "specifically , as is evident in tables  [ table : rw - wfpi ] , [ table : rw - lcpi ] , and [ table : lc - ttpi ] , the kinetic , potential , and total energies from the three different path integral approaches ( trapezoidal trotter , reweighted lvy - ciesielski , and reweighted wiener - fourier ) all agree .",
    "it is also important to note in this context that , while the presently computed total energies agree with those reported by chakravarty _",
    "et al._,@xcite the individual kinetic and potential energies do not . the kinetic energy reported by chakravarty _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite is approximately 0.8 k / particle higher than found in the present simulations ( with the potential energy being correspondingly lower ) .",
    "the magnitude of this difference is well outside the statistical error bars involved and appears to signal a systematic error .",
    "based on the observed consistency between the results produced by three different path integral methods and on the agreement between the t and h - method estimators for each of these path integral formulations , we feel confident of the results we have reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "_ note : _ after the present simulations had been completed , we have learned from d. m. ceperley that the off - diagonal pair density used as the starting point in the simulations reported in ref .",
