    "even if ngc 4151 were at its lowest flux state , the brightness of the nucleus would cause photon pileup in our sub - array observations , despite the reduced frame time .",
    "this is already evident in figure  [ image ] : the nucleus remains bright in the hardest band , while there is little effective area of hrma / acis - s3 in the very hard energy range ( @xmath45 kev ; see the _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide , pog ) .",
    "most of the hardest photons in the nucleus region actually come from piled soft photons .",

    "if the nucleus is in a similar high flux state , a count rate of 5 count s@xmath2 ( 0.9 count s@xmath2 after pileup and a pileup fraction @xmath070% ) is expected .",
    "we first extracted light curves of the ngc 4151 nucleus in each observations from the psf core .",
    "data were extracted from a @xmath47  radius circular region centered on the source ; this is approximately the 90% encircled energy radius of the point spread function ( psf ) at 1.49 kev ( figure  [ image ] ) .",
    "the ( negligible ) background data were taken from a source free , @xmath48  radius circular region of the same chip . in the same pimms energy band ,",
    "the observed count rate is between 0.88 and 0.97 count s@xmath2 without pileup correction , implying a significant pileup fraction .",
    "figure  [ lc ] shows the resulting light curves ( 0.312 kev ) of the nucleus for both obsids .",
    "there is a @xmath05% decrease in count rate over @xmath010 ks during the second part of obsid 9217 . at first glance",
    "it may reflect a real decrease of the intrinsic source flux , due to enhanced obscuration of the nucleus as seen in some other seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , mrk 766 , turner et al .",
    "2006 ; ngc 1365 , risaliti et al .",
    "2009a , b ) .",
    "however , it is known that the relationship between the source flux and the acis count rate is non - linear for a bright source due to heavy pileup .",
    "an increased source flux may result in a reduced count rate , causing more severe pileup ( sometimes a hole in the center of a bright source ) .",
    "we need to be aware of this possibility , and the following checking is applied .",
    "the events from ccd readout streaks are not affected by the pile up , because of the very short `` frame time '' ( 40@xmath49s to clock out electrons from one row to another ) and the spreading of photons over a larger area .",
    "using ciao tool _",
    "acisreadcorr_. with subarray observations , the readers are reminded that there is a known bug in the current version of _ acisreadcorr _ requiring modify the backscal header keyword . ] , the out - of - time source events can be identified with a status value .",
    "light curves were extracted for these unpiled photons in the acis readout streak and shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "there is a 50% increase in source count rate @xmath50ks after the starting of obsid 9217 , at the time of the apparent decrease in the psf core count rate .",
    "to compute the source count rate from the readout streak , we used the formula in marshall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the accumulated exposure of a readout streak ( @xmath51 ) , giving a @xmath52 s for obsid 9217 and @xmath53 s for obsid 9218 .",
    "the inferred source count rate is 2.3 cps and 3.5 cps for the first and second part of obsid 9217 , respectively , and 3.2 cps during obsid 9218 .",
    "a second check is offered by the wing of psf which contains very little encircled energy and hence a low count rate spread over a much larger area . therefore the events in the psf wings are not affected by pileup .",
    "we extracted light curves from a ring region centered on the nucleus ( with an inner radius of 5 pixel and an outer radius of 9 pixel ; figure  [ image ] ) in the outer nucleus region , which are shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "based on the encircled energy fraction , we expect the extracted count rate of the outer psf region represents approximately 2% of the total count rate level ( see   [ psfcorr ] ) .",
    "the source count rate inferred from this method is 2.8 cps and 3.6 cps for the first and second part of obsid 9217 , respectively , and 3.0 cps during obsid 9218 , which indicates that the observed lower count rate in the first part of obsid 9217 is due to an intrinsic low incident flux rather than the response of pileup to a higher flux .",
    "the readout streak and psf wings count rates agree well .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed count rates and these inferred true count rates indicates a significant pileup .",
    "pimms simulation indicates that the psf core suffers from @xmath03050% pileup , which is consistent with the pileup fraction estimated from the spectral fitting in the following section .",
    "a pileup mitigation method , described in great details in davis ( 2001 ) , is widely used and has been implemented in the spectral modeling tools such as _ xspec _ ( arnaud 1996 ) , _ sherpa _ ( freeman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by recovering identical spectral parameters from the moderately piled zeroth - order data of quasar s5 0836 + 7104 to those derived from unpiled hetg grating spectrum ( davis 2001 ) .",
    "next we use the davis ( 2001 ) pileup model to derive spectral parameters from fitting the piled psf core spectra and compare with unpiled spectra extracted from psf wings and transfer streak . to apply the pileup model ,",
    "it is important to analyze spectra extracted from observations with nearly constant count rate .",
    "we therefore divided obsid 9217 into two segments separated at @xmath54 ks based on the light curve ( figure  [ lc ] ) , dubbed 9217a ( high psf core count rate ) and 9217b ( low psf core count rate ) .",

    "we adopt the same dual power law model in the spectral fitting ( hereafter , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the photon index for the soft and the hard absorbed power law component , respectively ) . following yang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , narrow gaussian features are also added to fit the most prominent emission lines in the spectra .",

    "the spectra were grouped to a minimum of 25 counts per bin to use @xmath59 statistics .",
    "fitting statistics were evaluated including channels above 0.3 kev , up to 11 kev .",
    "davis ( 2008 , 6th ciao workshop ) emphasized that , it is important to include the available photons in the hardest energy range , even where _ chandra _ s hrma has little effective area . as these photons can only come from piled low energy photons , they are particularly useful to constrain the pileup model .",
    "if we blindly fit the apparently piled spectra with standard model such as a simple two power - law components , we get an extremely flat photon index @xmath60 for the hard component ( @xmath61 for the soft component ) . a similar hard photon index was derived in the piled psf core spectra in yang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . when the pileup model ( _ jdpileup _ , davis 2001 ) is applied , the corrected , still rather flat spectral indices are @xmath57=@xmath62 ( 90% confidence interval for one interesting parameter ) , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for obsids 9217a , 9217b , and 9218 , respectively .",

    "we adopted the same extraction annulus that was used to extract light curve of the psf wings ( see   [ ltcv ] ) .",
    "because of the luminous nucleus , the extracted spectrum still have enough photons to determine spectral slope .",
    "to model the spectra extracted from events only in the outskirts of the psf , we need to correct the arf for the extraction region of a partial psf coverage .",
    "this correction is energy dependent and can be done through simulation using _ chandra _ hrma ray - tracing simulator ( chart ) and marx . the detector position ( detx , dety ) of the nucleus",
    "was converted to the set of @xmath65 ( off - axis angle ) and @xmath66 ( rotation angle ) and input to chart , then the ray - tracing was used with our observation settings to create an event file with marx .",

    "the resulting fits with absorbed power law models and emission lines are shown in figure  [ psffit ] .",
    "we caution that the extended emission contributes to the extracted annulus when modeling the psf wings spectra . to quantify this contamination , first , we made use of the psf deconvolved hrc data ( wang et al .",
    "2009 ) and compared the extended counts in the extracted annulus to the nucleus .",
    "second , we took the readout streak spectra as the nuclear spectra , and simulated the nucleus as a point source with chart and marx .",

    "this gives us confidence to attempt fitting the psf core with more physically meaningful components while applying the pileup correction , as described in the next section .",
    "table  [ simple_tab ] also supports that there is consistent variations in the intrinsic flux among the three obsids , independent of which spectral fitting method is used . as indicated by the unpiled count rates in",

    "the most notable result from the spectral analysis above is the flat power law that characterizes the 210 kev spectrum of the ngc 4151 nucleus . as the circumnuclear region of an agn is a complex mixture of emitting and absorbing materials ( see turner & miller 2009 for a review ) , parameters from the satisfactory fitting with the simple phenomenological model adopted in   [ specdiag ]",

    "the _ rxte _",
    "light curve shows that the long _ asca _ observation caught the source in an overall low state .",
    "in addition , the _ asca _ light curve shows significant variations on time scales of a few hours . in order to investigate the nature of the lowest states",
    ", we extracted a spectrum from the whole observation , and from a 60  ks interval corresponding to the minimum in the light curve ( figure  [ pca]b ) . the data reduction has been performed following the standard procedure indicated by the _ asca _ team .",
    "we used screened events provided by the _",
    "archive for the gis intruments to extract the light curves and spectra from a circular region with a @xmath89 radius .",
    "the background was extracted from a source free region in the same field of view .",
    "the instrumental response files were created using the dedicated tools within the _ ftools _ package .",
    "we analyzed both the total and the low - state spectra adopting two different models for the hard ( @xmath902  kev ) emission : a simple absorbed power law , and the partial covering+reflection model described in   [ partial ] . in all cases we obtained a statistically acceptable result , with @xmath91 for the first model , and @xmath92 for the second one .",
    "given the low value of the reduced @xmath59 in both cases , we can not estimate whether the partial - covering fit is better than the simple power law one only based on the global statistics of the two fits .",
    "the analysis of the best fit spectral parameters provides interesting insghts on the nature of the x - ray emission : for both spectra , the partial covering model provides acceptable values for the continuum slope ( @xmath93 for the total spectrum , @xmath94 for the low - state spectrum ) .",
    "the intensity of the reflection component is r=1@xmath950.5 for the total spectrum , and r=2.5@xmath96 for the low state spectrum .",
    "this suggests that the reflected component seen in the low state spectrum is the echo of an on average higher emission , consistent with the _ rxte _ and _ asca _ light curves .",
    "the simple power law model provides a `` normal '' value of the continuum slope for the total spectrum ( @xmath97 ) , but an extremely flat value for the low state spectrum ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this confirms our interpretation of the _ chandra _ spectra , and in particular that ( 1 ) harder spectra are associated to lower flux states , and ( 2 ) that the flat observed emission is not due to an intrinsic change in the continuum shape , but to absorption effects and/or to the higher relative weight of the reflection component in low intrinsic flux states .",
    "the overall picture of the observed source variation is now improved : counterintuitive to the apparent light curve , we actually witnessed the source going from a moderate count rate ( obsid 9218 ) to a low count rate ( obsid 9217a ) and back to a high count rate ( obsid 9217b ) . as noted in   [ models ] , the interpretation of the physical origin of this variation is not straightforward and depends on the spectral modeling .      there have not been any reports for seyfert galaxies with spectral indices as flat as @xmath99 , unless they are in the compton thick regime .",
    "the earlier _ chandra _ result of @xmath100 for ngc 4151 , a clear - cut seyfert 1 galaxy was noted to be `` unusual '' ( yang et al .",
    "2001 ) , but not further discussed by ogle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or yang et al .",
    "we note that a few cases of low @xmath8 spectra exist in the literature .",
    "for example , a @xmath101 was measured for a radio loud quasar pks 2251 + 113 in the _ asca _ quasar sample ( reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "strateva et al . (",
    "2008 ) reported that one of the broad double - peaked balmer line emitting quasar sdss j2125 - 0813 , may also have an unusual flat x - ray spectrum @xmath102 .",
    "if the measured @xmath8 with the empirical , uniformly absorbed two power law components model indeed represents the slope of the intrinsic ngc 4151 continuum in the low state , it may have some implications for the accretion flow onto the central black hole .",
    "for example , a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; for reviews , see narayan et al . 1998 ; quataert 2001 ) is capable of producing a flat hard state x - ray spectrum .",
    "using a low - flux state 210 kev luminosity @xmath103 erg s@xmath2 , we derive a @xmath104 erg s@xmath2 for ngc 4151 from the bolometric correction derived in marconi et al .",
    "taking the latest measurement of the black hole mass @xmath105m@xmath13 for ngc 4151 from bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) yields an eddington luminosity of @xmath106 erg s@xmath2 , which implies the central engine of ngc 4151 is radiating at a relatively low efficiency , @xmath107 .",
    "the ratio indicates that the accretion rate of the ngc 4151 black hole is close to the critical value @xmath108 ( narayan et al .",
    "1998 , yuan 2007 ) for a riaf .    however , a more plausible interpretation is that the extreme flat slope is the outcome of over - simplified modeling .",
    "at least , the value of @xmath8 is known to depend strongly on the treatment of the complex absorbers ( weaver et al .",
    "1994a , zdziarski et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we have verified that the physically meaningful models ( reflection model discussed in   [ reflection ] and partial covering model discussed in   [ partc ] ) also can fit the readout streak spectra well ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 for the reflection model , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 for the partial covering model ) , yielding consistent @xmath8 values derived from the piled spectra but with poor constraints on the fitting parameters due to much less counts in the readout streak spectra and complexity of the models .",
    "although the reflection model (   [ ref_model ] ) fits the spectrum well , the problem of the flat spectral slope remains with the derived @xmath113 .",
    "the amount of reflection is characterised by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is often observed for seyfert 1s , meaning the illuminated infinite slab extends a solid angle of @xmath116 to the central source .",
    "it is also referred to as the ratio of the reflected intensity relative to the expected intensity from the surface subtending @xmath116 to the continuum source .",
    "the reflection seems unusally large , @xmath79=1.52.7 , while the fe@xmath29 line ew is relatively small @xmath117 ev , inconsistent with the large @xmath118 of the fe@xmath29 fluorescence line ( @xmath119 kev ) expected for strong reflection ( e.g. , guilbert & rees 1988 , george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the fe line flux is also constant within the errors during our observation , compared to the variable continuum .",
    "this result is easily explained in the standard cold reflection model where the narrow fek@xmath120 line is produced far from the primary x - ray source ( e.g. from the putative obscuring torus ) and so is not expected to vary rapidly . as ngc 4151 shows frequent `` flaring '' in the x - ray continuum light curve , the large",
    "@xmath79 observed here may result from a response to a previous x - ray flare produced in the inner disk region before the start of our _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the response to changes in the x - ray flux by the illuminated gas could even take longer than the light - crossing time between the primary x - ray source and the reflecting material ( nicastro et al .",
    "1999 , nayakshin & kazanas 2002 ) .",
    "for example , liu et al . (",
    "2010 ) have analyzed suzaku monitoring of ngc 5548 and found no strong correlation between fe@xmath29 flux and the continuum .",
    "in particular , the reflector could be the inner wall of a torus ( antonucci 1993 ; krolik et al .",
    "1994 ) a few hundred light - days away from the nucleus ( suganuma et al .",
    "the inner size of a dust torus in ngc 4151 was measured as @xmath121 days based on the lag time between the optical and near - infrared light curves ( minezaki et al .",
    "the observed narrow fe@xmath29 fluorescent line is expected , and is unresolved with _",

    "the high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) _ xmm_-newton / epic spectra suggest a broader intrinsic width ( @xmath123 ev , @xmath124 km s@xmath2 , schurch et al .",
    ". nevertheless , these values are consistent with a distant reflector .",
    "therefore at short time scale ( hours to days ) , correlation between the continuum flux , the reflection continuum and the iron line emission is unlikely to be found .    in figure  [ feline ] we show the long - term variation of the fe@xmath29 line flux based on earlier x - ray observations from _ asca _ , _",

    "ogle et al .",

    "we will examine this claim more carefully in our study of the enlr and compare with the lower spatial resolution @xmath128-newton study ( schurch et al .",
    "significant line intensity variation is only seen at time scale longer than 1 year , consistent with an origin from a distant reflector and the result from _ rxte _ monitoring ( markowitz et al .",
    "2003 ) . as suggested in markowitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the variation of fe@xmath29 observed with _",
    "rxte _ may still trace the intrinsic continuum variation in the long term .",
    "other means of obtaining a larger @xmath79 are possible , such as : the light - bending model which takes into account relativistic aberration ( ballantyne et al .",
    "2003 ) ; a peculiar inner disk geometry with deep funnel ; or a partly hidden continuum that is only seen by the reflector ( see turner & miller 2009 for review on strength of the reflection component )",
    ". however , these models apply to x - ray reprocessing by a compton - thick inner accretion disk , which is inconsistent with the fact that neither do we see a broad fe@xmath29 line , nor a strong fe@xmath29 line with large ew .",
    "it is also inconsistent with the low eddington ratio of ngc 4151 .",
    "nevertheless , a considerable number of observations of seyfert 1 galaxies have yielded @xmath129 values ( e.g. , mrk 335 , bianchi et al .",
    "2001 , larsson et al . 2008",
    "; mrk 841 , petrucci et al .",
    "notably , miniutti et al . ( 2007 ) obtained @xmath130 for mcg6 - 30 - 15 , which shows the broad iron line and reflection hump expected from x - ray reflection in the innermost regions of an accretion disk .",
    "terashima et al . ( 2009 ) found @xmath131 for the reflection component in ngc 4051 with a modest @xmath132 ev for fek line , similar to the ngc 4151 results .",
    "they suggest that the large reflection fraction is due to a delayed reflected emission to the variations between high - flux state and low - flux state .      to evaluate whether the partial covering component is required by the _ chandra _",
    "data , we performed an f - test comparing the statistics for the reflection model ( @xmath133 = 2380/2033 = 1.171 ) and the partial covering model ( @xmath133 = 2371/2029 = 1.169 ) based on the spectral models with fixed soft emission lines .",
    "the f - test statistic gives a probability 14% that suggests only a marginal improvement over the simpler reflection - only model .",
    "nevertheless the advantage of the spectral model consisting of compton reflection component and an additional partial covering component is that it provides a spectral slope @xmath134 (   [ partial ] ) well within the typical values of seyfert 1 agns .",
    "this suggests that we do not need to invoke an exotic explanation of the apparent flat spectrum .",
    "the spectral variations among the three segments could be attributed simply to a @xmath010% change in covering fraction of a high column absorber towards ngc 4151 , although a variation in the `` intrinsic '' continuum is equally possible ( e.g. , variation of compton - thick materials ) , given the uncertainties in the fitted values .",
    "fiore et al .",
    "( 1990 ) argued that the variation of the ngc 4151 spectral slope is intrinsic .",

    "the presence of a high column density ( @xmath136 @xmath3 ) x - ray absorber in the line of sight towards the ngc 4151 nucleus is not surprising and observed in previous studies .",
    "whitehouse & cruise ( 1985 ) reported a 2-ks dip in the exosat light curve of ngc 4151 , perhaps related to occultation by passage of a star across the line of sight towards the black hole .",

    "we note that the @xmath137 spectral study of ngc 4151 ( de rosa et al .",

    "their results show that , the column density of the warm absorber is consistent with being constant and only changes over a time scale longer than months .",
    "it is the covering fraction of the cold absorber ( varying on time scale of days ) that dominates the spectral variability .",

    "although limited by the signal to noise ratio , studies of short term spectral variability with high resolution grating spectra will be interesting .",

    "<S> the spectral variability during our observation can be interpreted as variations in intrinsic soft continuum flux relative to a compton reflection component that is from distant cold material and constant on short time scale , or variations of partially covering absorber in the line of sight towards the nucleus . an ionized absorber model with ionization parameter @xmath11 </S>",
