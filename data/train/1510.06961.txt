    "it is known that the spatial derivative of the solution to the ( backward ) kolmogorov equation can be represented as an expectation of a functional of the solution of an sde with some weight , namely the so - called bismut - elworthy - li ( bel ) formula as shown in @xcite and extended in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors use techniques from malliavin calculus to prove bel formula and employ it for the computation of sensitivities of financial options , also known as _",
    "greeks_.    in many applications , it is very natural to expect that the coefficients of a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) may depend on properties of the law of the solution , such as dependence on its moments .",
    "here , we want to extend the formula to mean - field type sdes following the essence of @xcite and show that such generalisation is actually non - trivial , requiring more regularity of the solution in the sense of malliavin .",
    "first , we give a relationship between the malliavin derivative and the spatial derivative of the solution with respect to the initial condition .",
    "already here we see that such generalisation involves an extra factor which is no longer adapted , thus requiring more ( malliavin ) regularity on the solution which is not immediate .",
    "fortunately , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are lipschitz continuous in space , then the solution is twice malliavin differentiable , as it is shown in @xcite , and hence a formula using the skorokhod integral may be expected .",
    "using such relation one can find the bel formula in this context .",
    "some merely illustrative examples are provided in order to give a better insight on the effect of mean - field sdes in the bel formula . in the last examples we carry out some simulations to show that the malliavin method is more efficient compared to a finite difference method , especially when the function involved is discontinuous .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ frame ] we collect some summarised basic facts on malliavin calculus needed for the derivation of the main results of the paper . in section [ sectionbel ] we include all intermediate steps towards the main result which is the bismut - elworthy - li formula in the context of mean - field sdes .",
    "finally , section [ sectionappl ] is devoted to provide some illustrative examples of this generalised bismut - elworthy - li formula with simulations .",
    "the findings are similar to those in @xcite , the use of bismut - elworthy - li s formula serves as a much more efficient method to compute sensitivities with respect to initial data , especially when the function involved in the expectation is highly irregular .",
