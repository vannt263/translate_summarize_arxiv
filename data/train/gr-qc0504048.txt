    "general relativity ( gr ) deals with dynamical deformations of space and time , making a massive use of tensor calculus in parallel with continuum mechanics . in recent years",
    "the exploration of einstein s theory has received a strong acceleration from the growing efforts in high - precision experiments involving gravity . ground - based and space - born",
    "interferometers like ligo , virgo , tama , geo600 , and lisa should at long last allow detection of gravitational waves .",
    "the analysis of the expected signals will require precise theoretical templates to be compared with the measured waveforms via pattern matching .",
    "for this reason a variety of theoretically simulated scenarios are needed , as obtained by numerical integration of the systems of partial differential equations ( pde s ) of gr .",
    "the striking developments of numerical relativity over the last ten years , which rely on presently available large - scale computational resources , have shown that some engineering tools such as the finite - elements techniques can be fruitfully adopted to these ends .",
    "on the other hand , the need to deal with event horizons , cauchy horizons , and infinite - curvature singularities during the numerical evolution still poses serious theoretical and numerical challenges .    in the past",
    "a very simple and yet profound analogy between gr and newtonian physics has been noticed @xcite and it can be hoped that the former may benefit from the wide body of knowledge which is available for the latter . in particular , given a perfect barotropic and irrotational newtonian fluid , perturbations of the velocity potential with respect to a background solution have been analysed and shown to satisfy a second - order linear hyperbolic equation with non - constant coefficients . by algebraic manipulations",
    "this wave equation can be rewritten as a klein - gordon field propagating on a pseudo - euclidean four - dimensional riemannian manifold : an induced effective gravity is at work in the fluid , in which the speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light .",
    "gr , however , prescribes the existence of black holes .",
    "surprisingly , some of the induced geometries in the analog formulation have the same structure as those of a black hole .",
    "sound waves crossing the horizon of these acoustic counterparts will never come back out . at this level",
    "a practical problem arises .",
    "a black hole acts on light propagation as an anisotropic medium having an infinite refractive index at the horizon , and from studies of strongly anisotropic media , one can anticipate that a numerical study of this problem will face serious difficulties .",
    "one may also ask whether black - hole behavior could emerge in other fields where hyperbolic wave equations are met , for instance in dealing with electromagnetism of anisotropic media or with perturbations of elastic objects .",
    "fortunately , numerical relativity has developed the proper instruments to deal with this type of problems , through the use of excision techniques together with a constrained evolution scheme for strongly hyperbolic problems .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to use this methodology in the study of the simplest acoustic black hole , _ i.e. _ the draining bathtub model of visser @xcite .",
    "while much can be borrowed from the extensive literature in numerical relativity , the task of developing the apparatus needed to pursue this black - hole analog on fully quantitative grounds by numerical simulations does not seem to have been previously addressed . the relevance of these studies to superradiant extraction of rotational energy from a vortex in a bose - einstein condensate has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we present a detailed analytical study of the draining bathtub geometry in analogy with standard treatments of a rotating kerr black hole . in sect .",
    "iii we recast the hyperbolic equation to a constrained symmetric system of first - order pde s and solve a numerical scattering problem on the basis of a finite - element method . in sect .",
    "iv we analyse",
    "the time evolution of both compact and quasi - monochromatic sound - wave pulses , report on tests of the validity of the proposed procedure , and pay special attention to the scattering of a quasi - monochromatic wavepacket in the superradiant regime . finally , sect .",
    "v concludes the paper with a discussion of the main results and an illustration of future perspectives regarding vortices in superfluids .",
    "we aim at investigating sound - wave scattering processes from a sonic black hole by studying the time evolution of a scalar field in the presence of a vortex in the fluid flow .",
    "it is well known @xcite that sound propagation in such a fluid is described by a wave equation which , under the assumption of long - wavelength perturbations , can be mapped onto a klein - gordon equation associated with an effective relativistic curved space - time background ( an acoustic metric ) . we focus our attention on the acoustic metric associated to the draining - bathtub model introduced by visser @xcite for a rotating acoustic black hole .",
    "the model is based on irrotational barotropic and incompressible euler s equations describing a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional flow with a sink at the origin .",
    "the flow is taken as vorticity - free ( apart from a possible @xmath0-function contribution at the vortex core ) and angular momentum is conserved .",
    "these constraints imply that the density of the fluid , the background pressure , and the speed of sound @xmath1 are constant throughout the flow .",
    "the background velocity potential must therefore have the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a length scale associated with the radius \" of the vortex horizon and @xmath4 is the ( constant ) rotation frequency .",
    "such a velocity potential , being discontinuous on going through @xmath5 radians , is a multivalued function . therefore it must be interpreted as being defined patch - wise on overlapping regions around the vortex core at @xmath6 .",
    "the velocity of the fluid is then given by @xmath7 the acoustic metric associated to this configuration is @xmath8 it is easily shown that the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) exhibits an acoustic event horizon located at @xmath9 , where the radial component of the fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound , and an ergosphere at @xmath10 .",

    "the light cones point towards the singularity , so that the interior region is causally disconnected from the region outside the horizon .",
    "thanks to this property , one can impose a generic well - behaved boundary condition inside the horizon and sidestep the problem of constraint violations inside the acoustic black hole .",
    "this procedure is computationally very demanding , as it relies upon a very fine discretization around the sonic horizon .",
    "owing to requirements of high resolution , long integration times , and distant outer boundary , even the simple klein - gordon equation in kerr black - hole geometry has only recently been successfully implemented with a powerful multi - processor code @xcite . following scheel _",
    "@xcite , we have implemented the excision technique for an acoustic black hole and chosen the boundary conditions as follows .    we have set no boundary conditions on the inner boundary @xmath64 , with @xmath65 . regarding the outer boundary @xmath66 , the proper criterion is to adopt conditions which will not violate constraints , will not spontaneously generate unphysical waves , and will not significantly back - reflect any incoming signal .",
    "in our case we have first defined the directional derivatives of @xmath43 along the principal null directions given in eq .",

    "<S> the scattering process of a dynamic perturbation impinging on a draining - tub model of an acoustic black hole is numerically solved in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> analogies with real black holes of general relativity are explored by using recently developed mathematical tools involving finite elements methods , excision techniques , and constrained evolution schemes for strongly hyperbolic systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it is shown that superradiant scattering of a quasi - monochromatic wavepacket can produce strong amplification of the signal , offering the possibility of a significant extraction of rotational energy at suitable values of the angular frequency of the vortex and of the central frequency of the wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that theoretical tools recently developed for gravitational waves can be brought to fruition in the study of other problems in which strong anisotropies are present . </S>"
