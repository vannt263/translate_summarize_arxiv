    "in general , under some appropriate conditions , @xmath0-estimators enjoy some nice properties , for example , the asymptotic efficiency of ( quasi-)mle and oracle properties of regularized estimators .",
    "however , it may suffer from heavy computation load since it is batch estimation in the sense that we have to optimize the appropriate objective function .",
    "it would be of great help to be able to carry out recursive estimation , where we update the estimator by doing some fine tuning of the previous one . in this way",
    ", it enables us to process enormous data effectively .",
    "recursive estimation is established as an application of stochastic approximation theory , which is mainly used in control system and computer science ( see e.g. , robbins and monro @xcite , nevelson and khasminskii @xcite , dvoretzky @xcite , borkar @xcite ) .",

    "specifically , we wish to construct a sequence of estimates @xmath14 , computed in a recursive manner , in such a way that for any @xmath15 , the difference @xmath16 is a function described by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and some ( not all ) data , and @xmath20 exhibits suitable convergence property for an arbitrary initial value @xmath21 .",
