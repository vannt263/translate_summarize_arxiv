    "a periodic structure composed of alternating elastic and piezoelectric layers , where the faces of each piezoelectric layer are electroded and connected by a circuit with the capacity @xmath0 , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the dispersion equation for a bilayered unit cell has been obtained in @xcite and generalized for a multilayered unit cell in @xcite .",
    "the tunable via @xmath0 effective constants of the periodic structure were derived in @xcite .",
    "it has been noted in @xcite that the capacity @xmath0 of the external circuit may be negative .",
    "the present paper analyzes some unusual features of the floquet - bloch dispersion spectrum occurring at @xmath6 in such a case , using the definition of the quasistatic effective elastic constant @xmath7 @xcite , it is shown that the most interesting behavior comes about at low frequency .",
    "this is because the value of @xmath7 becomes negative in the certain interval of @xmath1 , where @xmath7 varies from @xmath8 to zero . as a result , at @xmath9 there occurs an absolute stopband which starts from the quasistatic limit @xmath3 , while the first dispersion branch starts from nonzero @xmath10 . at certain negative @xmath0 ,",
    "the group velocity of this branch changes from positive to negative value .",
    "other peculiar features are infinite group velocity at the origin @xmath11 of the first dispersion branch at the pole @xmath12 and a flat band @xmath3 at @xmath13 .",
    "consider a periodic structure whose unit cell consists of elastic layer 1 and piezoelectric layer 2 .",
    "suppose that the faces of each piezoelectric layer are electroded and connected by a circuit with capacity @xmath14 let a time - harmonic longitudinal wave propagate along the axis @xmath15 orthogonal to the layer interfaces .",
    "denote the density and elastic constant of the elastic layer by @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the density and elastic , piezoelectric and dielectric constants of the piezoelectric layer by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21,@xmath22 the layer thicknesses are @xmath23 and @xmath24 so that the period is @xmath25 the displacement @xmath26 and stress@xmath27 at the period edges @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related as follows @xcite",
    "@xmath30with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the surface area of the electrode , @xmath33 means transposition and @xmath34 in view of ( [ 9 ] ) , the dispersion equation of the floquet - bloch spectrum @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the floquet wavenumber .",
    "according to @xcite , taking low - frequency asymptotics yields the quasistatic effective elastic constant and effective density of the periodic structure in the form of @xmath38 the corresponding quasistatic effective speed is @xmath39 our purpose is to analyze the dispersion spectrum and its low - frequency limit in the case @xmath1 .",
    "following @xcite , consider an example of the glass / pzt periodically bilayered structure where each pzt layer is electroded and connected as in the inset to fig .",
    "let @xmath40 mm .",
    "the material constants are given in @xcite .",
    "the dependence ( [ a9 ] ) of the quasistatic effective elastic constant @xmath7 on @xmath0 is plotted in fig .",
    "it is seen that @xmath7 is negative for @xmath41 where @xmath42 are pole and zero of @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a quasistatic absolute stopband which starts from @xmath44 and extends to a certain nonzero @xmath10 .",
    "let us examine in detail the evolution of the dispersion spectrum with the decrease of @xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 displays a set of dispersion spectra at different fixed values of @xmath1 which are compared with the spectrum at @xmath45 .",
    "it is seen that the values @xmath46 first affect the second branch @xmath35 which changes the slope from negative to positive . as @xmath47 approaches @xmath48 @xmath49 , the group velocity @xmath50 of the first branch at the origin point @xmath51 tends to infinity ( along with the quasistatic phase velocity ( [ es ] ) ) .",
    "this implies stiffening effect which can be observed in @xcite . in the interval @xmath52 ,",
    "where @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , there is the absolute stopband starting from the quasistatic limit @xmath3 . at certain @xmath53 ,",
    "the first branch which starts from @xmath54 becomes flat and then changes slope from positive to negative , see fig . 2 at @xmath55 @xmath49 and @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 @xmath49 the quasistatic elastic constant @xmath7 and hence the quasistatic phase velocity begin to grow from zero , so that the first dispersion branch reappears at its quasistatic origin @xmath11 . further decrease of @xmath0 affects the position of the first stopband , as it is observed in fig . 2 for @xmath59 @xmath60 , ... , @xmath61 @xmath49 .",
    "a possibility has been shown of the quasistatic absolute stopband , the infinite group velocity and the flat bands in the floquet - bloch spectrum of a periodic structure of elastic and piezoelectric layers where the faces of each piezoelectric layer are electroded and connected via a circuit with negative capacity @xmath0 .",
