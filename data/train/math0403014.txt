    "since the establishment of matveev - piergallini calculus , simple spines of @xmath0-manifolds have been one of the most powerful tools to study these spaces .",
    "they allowed a combinatorial approach to many fundamental topics as the study of state - sum quantum invariants and the study of complexity of @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "branched spines of @xmath0-manifolds , which could be viewed as the smoothed version of simple spines , were first introduced and studied by benedetti and petronio in @xcite . among other substantial results , in this book , benedetti and petronio showed that each @xmath0-manifold has a branched spines and identified the topological structure encoded by these objects on the ambient manifolds as a particular class of non - singular vector fields they called _ concave transversing fields_. at a more rough level , it can be showed that branched spines can be used to represent the @xmath1-structures on the ambient manifolds .    in the present work , instead of viewing branched spines as a tool to represent @xmath0-manifolds equipped with additional structures",
    ", we will use these objects to re - obtain a representation theory of naked @xmath0-manifolds . to clarify the reason why we are interested in such a representation theory we notice that a branched spine is much less symmetric than a non - branched one .",
    "moreover , a branched spine is dual to a triangulation of the ambient manifold whose `` abstract '' tetrahedra can be canonically `` parametrized '' by the standard simplex @xmath2 in @xmath3 : indeed , using the branching , we can canonically identify in each dual tetrahedron the vertex corresponding to each @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this kind of branched triangulations underlie the definition of the quantum invariants obtained as state - sum and this is the main motivation for the present note . indeed , using these objects , s.baseilhac and r.benedetti constructed in @xcite and @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) the so - called classical and quantum dilogarithmic invariants for @xmath0-manifolds equipped with principal flat @xmath6-bundles .    in the present paper",
    "we show , in particular , that two branchings on a given triangulation can be connected by means of a finite sequence of basic ( @xmath7 , and `` bubble '' ) branched modification of branched triangulations . with the terminology of baseilhac - benedetti",
    ", this implies that _ the branching state sum invariance is a consequence of its @xmath8 invariance_.    before plunging into the details , let us note that what we call `` calculus for branched spines '' should be better called `` calculus for branched skeleta '' in the sense that we show that two branched spines of the same @xmath0-manifold are connected by a sequence of moves which contains an ( algebraic ) number of bubble - moves equal to zero ; hence , during the sequence , the spines could be transformed into spines of the manifold obtained by puncturing the ambient manifold , which are also called skeleta of the initial manifold .",
    "fortunately this causes no harm since the initial ambient manifold can always be canonically reconstructed from a skeleton . in terms of dual triangulations this means the natural fact that the number of vertices is not fixed .",

    "in this section we recall the notion of branched polyhedron and some basic facts about branched spines of @xmath0-manifolds . from now on , we will deal only with polyhedra which have the property of containing only regions which are orientable surfaces ( this is due to our definition of branching , see definition [ branchingcondition ] ) and with oriented @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "a _ simple polyhedron _ is a finite polyhedron of dimension @xmath9 whose local model are the three shown in figure [ fig : singularityinspine ] . an _ embedded spine _ of a @xmath0-manifold @xmath10 is a simple polyhedron @xmath11 embedded in @xmath10 in a locally flat way ( i.e. so that there exist local charts as those shown in figure [ fig : singularityinspine ] ) so that @xmath10 retracts on @xmath11 ( if @xmath12 ) or @xmath13 retracts on @xmath11 ( if @xmath14 ) .",
    "the _ singular set _ of a simple polyhedron @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath15 , is the union of the edges and vertices ( see figure [ fig : singularityinspine ] ) .",
    "the _ regions _ of a simple polyhedron @xmath11 are the connected components of the complement of a small open regular neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "a simple polyhedron is said to be _ standard _ if its regions are all discs , its singular set is connected and contains at least a vertex .",
    "it is well known that any @xmath0-manifold admits a spine , even a standard one , moreover the following holds :    any two standard spines of the same @xmath0-manifold are connected by means of a suitable sequence of local moves ( and their inverses ) as the one shown in the lower part of figure [ 2mosse ] and called the @xmath7-move .",
    "more in general , two simple spines of the same @xmath0-manifold are connected by a suitable sequence of this move and moves of the type shown in the upper part of figure [ 2mosse ] and their inverses ; this last move is called the lune - move or @xmath16-move .",

    ", width=491 ]    the above theorem is the well known calculus for spines of @xmath0-manifolds proved independently by matveev and piergallini respectively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another local move we will use is called _ bubble - move _ it is applied in the interior of a region and its effect is drawn in figure [ fig : bubble ] .    given a simple polyhedron @xmath11",
    "we define the notion of _ branching _ on it as follows :    [ branchingcondition ] a branching @xmath20 on @xmath11 is a choice of an orientation of each region of @xmath11 such that no edge of the singular set of @xmath11 is induced three times the same orientation by the regions containing it .",
    "this definition corresponds to the definition of `` orientable branching '' given in @xcite .",
    "not all the simple polyhedra admit a branching and , on the contrary , there are some which admit more than one ( see @xcite , chapter iii ) .",
    "we will say that a polyhedron is _ branchable _ if it admits a branching and we will call _ branched polyhedron _ a pair @xmath21 where @xmath20 is a branching on the polyhedron @xmath11 .",

    ". moreover , each region of @xmath11 naturally corresponds to a region of @xmath22 and the region of @xmath22 which does not correspond to one of @xmath11 is the small disc created by the move ( see figure [ 2mosse ] ) .",
    "hence the branching on @xmath11 induces a choice of an orientation on each region of @xmath22 except on that disc and these orientations satisfy the branching condition on all the edges of @xmath22 not touched by that disc .",
    "analogously , if @xmath22 is obtained from @xmath11 through the inverse of a basic move , then each region of @xmath22 corresponds to a region of @xmath11 and hence the branching on @xmath11 induces an orientation on each region of @xmath22 .",
    "[ branchedmove ] a basic move @xmath23 applied on a branched polyhedron @xmath11 is called _ branchable _ if it is possible to choose an orientation on the disc created by the move which , together with the orientations on the regions of @xmath22 induced by the branching of @xmath11 , defines a branching on @xmath22 .",
    "analogously , the inverse of a basic move applied to @xmath11 is branchable if the orientations induced by the branching of @xmath11 on the regions of @xmath22 define a branching .",
    "a branching is a kind of loss of symmetry on a polyhedron and this is reflected by the fact that each move has many different branched versions . to enumerate all the possible embedded branched versions of the moves",
    ", one has to fix any possible orientation on the regions of the left part of figure [ 2mosse ] and then complete these orientations in the right part of the figure by fixing one orientation on the region created by the move ; by definition [ branchedmove ] , one obtains a branched version of a basic move when the branching condition is satisfied both in the left and in the right part of the figure .",
    "fortunately , many of the possible combinations are equivalent up to symmetries of the pictures , so that all the resulting local moves have been classified in @xcite .",

    "the arrow on the left indicates the vertical direction .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=430 ]    we note here that in some cases both orientations on the region created by a move satisfy the branching condition , and this produces different branched versions of the same move .",
    "this is the case of the bumping moves : for instance in the lower part of figure [ branched mp ] the orientation fixed on the disc created by the move is such that the left most region and the disc induce opposite orientations on the edge separing them , so that the disc appears as a smooth continuation of the leftmost region out of that edge .",
    "the same phenomenon happens for leftmost sliding - moves in figures [ branched lune ] and [ branched mp ] .",
    "in these cases , exploiting the asymmetry of the branching after the move , we say that the upper - right region `` slides over '' the upper - left region and creates the disc .",
    "more in general , each instance of branched move can be viewed as a local sliding of a region over some neighboring one : in figures [ branched lune ] and [ branched mp ] the sliding region is always the one which , after the application of the move , is the uppermost with respect to the depicted vertical direction .",
    "we warn the reader that , in the following section , with an abuse of notation , we will often call the small disc created by a positive branched - move with the same name as the region over which the sliding has been performed ; anyhow , this abuse will always be explicitly pointed out .",
    "it has already been proved in @xcite[chapter 3 ] that any lune and @xmath7-move is branchable , but that there are some inverse lune - moves and @xmath24-moves which are not branchable .",
    "let us now analyze the branched versions of the bubble - move , referring to figure [ fig : bubble ] for the notation .",
    "if one assigns an orientation to @xmath25 such that the orientation it induces on @xmath17 is the same as the one induced by @xmath19 on @xmath17 , then the bubble - move is said to be a _ sliding _ bubble - move . the other case is called _ bumping _ bubble - move ; as shown in figure [ branched bubble ] , while performing an embedded bumping bubble move inside an oriented @xmath0-manifold , two subversions of the move can be distinguished depending on whether @xmath25 lies `` over '' or `` under '' @xmath19 ; indeed the orientation of @xmath19 and the orientation of the ambient manifold allow us to distinguish an upper and a lower face of @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite , benedetti and petronio proved that every orientable @xmath0-manifold admits a branched spine .",
    "moreover , in @xcite and @xcite they identified a refined topological structure which is naturally encoded by a branching on a spine . indeed , the vertical vector field in figure [ branching ] determines a well - defined homotopy class of vector fields on the ambient manifold which are positively transverse to the spine , whose orbits are properly embedded arcs and which are transverse to the boundary of the manifold except in a finite set of simple closed curves where they are tangent in a concave fashion .",
    "these particular kinds of vector fields where called `` concave transversing fields '' by benedetti and petronio who , in @xcite and @xcite among a series of other results , proved a calculus for manifolds equipped with these fields , which we very roughly summarize as follows :    [ teo : calcolo raffinato ] to each embedded branched spine one can naturally associate an homotopy class of concave transversing fields ; moreover , any two branched spines encoding the same class , are connected by a sequence of embedded branched moves of the types which in figures [ branched lune ] , [ branched mp ] and [ branched bubble ] are called `` sliding''-moves .",
    "if the ambient manifold is closed then the sequence can be chosen to contain no bubble - move .",
    "the above result represents a highly refined calculus for branched spines and was used in @xcite as a fundamental step to produce topological invariants of homotopy classes of concave transversing fields .",
    "if one is interested in representing @xmath0-manifolds by means of branched spines but is not interested in the particularly refined structure that the branching encodes , then one needs to find a calculus for branched spines allowing one to apply moves which change the homotopy class of concave transversing fields represented by the spines to include all of them .",
    "we then prove the following :    [ thm : branchedspines ] let @xmath10 ( with @xmath26 possibly empty ) be an oriented and compact @xmath0-manifold and let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be two branched standard spines of @xmath10 .",
    "there exists a sequence of branched moves including @xmath24-moves , lune - moves and bubble - moves connecting @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the sequence can be constructed so that at any step the spines involved are standard .      by the calculus of matveev - piergallini ,",
    "any two standard spines of @xmath10 are connected by a sequence of @xmath24-moves . moreover , by a result of y. makovetsky ( see @xcite ) , it is possible to choose two sequences of positive @xmath24-moves connecting respectively @xmath27 and @xmath28 to the same standard spine @xmath11 of @xmath10 .",
    "since these sequences are composed by positive moves , they are branchable and hence they connect @xmath27 and @xmath28 to two different branched versions of the same spine @xmath11 .",
    "let us call these two branchings on @xmath11 respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in what follows , we will show that , using also branched versions of bubble - moves , lune and @xmath7-moves , it is possible to connect the branched spine @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the regions of @xmath11 oriented according to @xmath34 ; since @xmath10 is oriented , it makes sense to speak of the upper face and of the lower face of a region of @xmath11 with respect to a branching .",
    "apply a bumping bubble - move as shown in the central part of figure [ branched bubble ] to each region @xmath35 over which @xmath34 and @xmath36 differ , so that the bubbles are attached along the upper face of the region with respect to @xmath29 and call @xmath37 the new discs attached by the bubble - moves ( @xmath25 in figure [ branched bubble ] ) . with an abuse of notation , exploiting the asymmetry of the bumping bubble - moves , we will call @xmath38 also the small disc ( @xmath19 in figure [ branched bubble ] ) created inside @xmath38 by the gluing of @xmath39 .",
    "note that the polyhedron @xmath40 obtained after the application of these moves contains @xmath31 as a branched sub - polyhedron and in particular for each edge or vertex of @xmath11 there is a corresponding one in @xmath40 ; moreover , @xmath40 is necessarily non standard : we will sketch how to restore the standard setting in the end of the section .",
    "analogously , let us call @xmath41 the polyhedron obtained by applying the above procedure using the branching @xmath36 to choose the upper faces of the regions .",
    "it is clear that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are branched version of the same polyhedron @xmath22 ; we keep calling @xmath34 and @xmath36 their branchings .",
    "the idea of the proof is to slide the regions @xmath39 in @xmath40 to a final position where the roles of @xmath35 and of @xmath37 are exchanged and so , in particular , each @xmath35 appears as a bubble applied to the center of @xmath37 , on its upper face : this connects @xmath40 and @xmath41 by a sequence of branched moves ( not including bubble - moves ) .    here and",
    "in what follows we will use the natural identification induced by a branched move between the regions of a polyhedron before and after the move as explained in the preceding section .",
    "moreover , for the sake of simplicity , we suppose that the edges and the vertices we deal with are touched by distinct regions ; this is not true in general but the proof can be easily adapted to the general case using local names for the regions around the edges and the vertices instead of the names @xmath42 .",
    "we split the proof in two steps :    1 .   for each edge @xmath43 of @xmath11",
    "we use positive lune - moves near the corresponding edge @xmath44 in @xmath40 to create an edge such that if @xmath43 is touched by @xmath38 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in @xmath11 then the new edge is touched by @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 if @xmath34 equals @xmath36 on @xmath51 in @xmath11 and is @xmath52 otherwise .",
    "this sequence of moves modifies @xmath40 creating some additional singular locus and hence producing a polyhedron no longer homeomorphic to @xmath22 , but since it acts only near the center of the edges of @xmath40 , the vertices of @xmath40 and hence of @xmath11 are identified with a subset of the vertices of the resulting polyhedron .",
    "2 .   for each vertex @xmath53 of @xmath11",
    ", we apply a sequence of branched moves to the corresponding vertex @xmath54 in the polyhedron obtained after step @xmath55 to create a vertex such that if @xmath38 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the regions of @xmath40 touching @xmath53 then the vertex is touched by the regions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( where , again , @xmath50 if @xmath34 and @xmath36 are equal in @xmath11 on @xmath51 and is @xmath52 otherwise ) .",
    "the sequence of moves we apply has also the effect of eliminating the extra singular locus created during the first step so that the final polyhedron we get is @xmath41 .",

    "each branching on an edge together with the orientation of @xmath10 , produces a cyclic ordering of the regions touching it and a notion of up and down near it , so that we can define as shown in figure [ fig : types ] the regions of type @xmath55 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 with respect to the branching on the edge .",

    "now apply step @xmath55 and then apply an inverse lune - move to slide @xmath39 out of @xmath103 .",
    "it can be checked that the polyhedron one obtains is equal to the result of step @xmath55 obtained by following the proof in the non standard case , but never passes through non standard polyhedra so that one can proceed with step @xmath9 . to ensure that also during step @xmath9 one does not produce non standard polyhedra , it is sufficient to observe that the only moment when such a polyhedron can be obtained is when one concludes one of the sequences of figures [ fig : type1 ] , [ fig : type2 ] and [ fig : type3 ] through the pair of inverse lune moves and the region to be slid , after the move , becomes a bubble over another region of the polyhedron . in this case",
