    "hl canis majoris , despite being one of the brightest dwarf novae , was long overlooked because of its location in the sky 9 arcminutes south of sirius .",
    "hl cma was first detected when observations of sirius by _ einstein _",
    "showed a nearby x - ray source , whose location matched that of a variable star on plates from the harvard archive @xcite ; subsequent optical photometry and spectroscopy exhibited characteristics typical of dwarf novae , such as recurring outbursts on an approximately 15-day cycle and balmer emission lines .",
    "further photometric study revealed standstills in 1982 and 1999 @xcite that led to the further classification of hl cma as a z cam star . in 2001 , the variable also exhibited an unusual outburst cycle of roughly 30 days @xcite .    a spectroscopic study of hl cma by @xcite gave an orbital period of either 0.22 or 0.18 d. they obtained spectra during both outburst and quiescence and found no conclusive evidence in their data for orbital phase - dependent phenomena .",
    "@xcite then studied optical spectra of the rise to outburst , maximum , and decline from outburst .",
    "they found a period of 0.2145(4 ) d and noted absorption wings around the balmer and hei lines .",
    "most recently , @xcite have given a period of either 0.2146(4 ) or 0.2212(5 ) d , based on data obtained during outburst .",
    "they also found that the balmer lines were composed of a narrow core , brightest as it shifts from red to blue , and a broader component that does not vary greatly in brightness .",
    "after more than two decades of study , hl cma still lacked a precisely determined orbital period .",
    "for this reason , we collected spectra over many runs in order to suppress aliasing and determine the period without ambiguity . in the process of gathering these observations ,",
    "an improved finding chart was also created which is now available from the living edition of the catalog and atlas of cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "spectra of hl canis majoris were taken over 14 observing runs between 2000 january and 2004 march from the mdm observatory at kitt peak , arizona , using mainly the 2.4 m hiltner telescope .",
    "the 2001 december data were obtained on the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope .",
    "the spectra were obtained during both outburst and quiescence .",
    "two spectra , taken in 2000 january , were obtained during the standstill that began in 1999 @xcite , and many spectra were obtained during the unusual outburst state in 2001 - 2002 reported by @xcite .    the observation and reduction procedures for the hiltner telescope data were mostly as described in @xcite . in brief",
    ", we used the modular spectrograph and a site @xmath4 ccd detector , with 2.0   pixel@xmath5 from 4300 to 7500   and a spectral resolution of 3.5  .",
    "the mcgraw - hill observations were made with the mark iii spectrograph and a site @xmath6 ccd detector , with 2.2   pixel@xmath5 from 4500 to 6800   and a spectral resolution of 5.0  .",
    "many comparison hg - ne - xe lamp spectra were taken throughout each night in the runs from january 2000 through october 2003 , while the night sky lines were used for the wavelength zero point for the january and march 2004 data .",
    "the spectra were then reduced using standard iraf procedures .",
    "we observed flux standard stars when conditions appeared clear , and the flux calibration was checked by calculating the @xmath7 magnitudes from the spectra using the passband tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath7 magnitudes for outburst spectra were between 12.5 and 11.6 , similar to the 11.7 given by the living edition @xcite , while those of the quiescent spectra were close to 14.0 , while the living edition gives a magnitude of 14.5 .",
    "typically , the flux calibrations for our setup are accurate to approximately 10 to 20 percent , with systematic errors dominating .",
    "the quiescent spectra show balmer line emission , as well as heii @xmath8 and several hei lines , all of which are typical of dwarf novae in quiescence . in outburst , the spectra show broad absorption wings around h@xmath2 , h@xmath9 , and hei @xmath10 , as noted in previous studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ciii / niii feature also stands out strongly just blueward of heii @xmath8 .",
    "this feature is not as clear in the quiescent spectra but seems to be weakly present .",
    "table 1 gives the equivalent widths and fwhm for each state .",
    "figure 1 shows the average of the january 2002 spectra and that of the october 2003 spectra , from which the measurements in table 1 were determined .",
    "the two spectra obtained during standstill , as well as those obtained during the unusual outburst cycle , do not appear to differ significantly from spectra obtained during a normal outburst .",
    "the radial velocities , given in table 2 , were determined from the h@xmath1 emission line using convolution methods set forth by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "shafter s technique convolves the spectral line with a positive and a negative gaussian separated by a given width , instead of the derivative of a gaussian used by schneider and young .",
    "we used gaussians each with a width of 6   and separated by 14   for our data .",
    "the velocities had uncertainties estimated from counting statistics errors of typically 7 km s@xmath5 or less .",
    "we searched for the orbital frequency using the  residualgram \" method @xcite , which gave a well - determined frequency of 4.61282 d@xmath5 .",
    "the large number of observing runs , coupled with long sequences of observations during those runs , resulted in an unambiguous cycle count over the four - year span of the data set .",
    "figure 2 shows the periodigram of this search .",
    "the monte carlo test described by @xcite gives a discriminatory power of 998/1000 for the 4.61282 d@xmath5 frequency , which corresponds to an orbital period of 0.216787 d. the velocities , weighted by their uncertainties , were then fit to a sinusoid @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the parameters of the fit are given in table 3 , and the folded velocity plot is shown in figure 3 .    while the period we determined is similar to those suggested in previous studies of hl cma , it still differs from them by more than the margin of error in each . to further ensure that our period is correct , we determined the radial velocities from the h@xmath1 line using the original convolution method of @xcite , and also determined the velocities from the h@xmath2 and hei @xmath3 5876 lines using both methods .",
    "the errors in the velocities from h@xmath2 and hei @xmath3 5876 were typically of the order of 10 to 20 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the results from the period searches of each set of velocities are listed in table 3 .",
    "the h@xmath2 velocities did not independently confirm our choice of cycle count , evidently because of inadqueate signal - to - noise , but did show strong power at our adopted period ; the fits listed in table 3 are for the alias which matches our preferred ephemeris . in general ,",
    "the less - noisy fits in table 3 give periods more closely matching the adopted period . as a final check , we split up the first set of h@xmath1 velocities into two sets according to the state of the system . performing the period search on each of these sets",
    "both produced essentially the same period as the original search on the full data set .",
    "thus we are confident that our period is correct .",
    "we have determined the orbital period of hl cma unambiguously to be 0.2167867(17 ) d. we also have found no significant differences between spectra taken during standstill , during outburst , and during the unusual outbursting in 2001 - 2002 .    _ acknowledgments .",
