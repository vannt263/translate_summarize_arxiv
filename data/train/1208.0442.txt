    "let us also briefly review the basic idea of the original blind quantum computation protocol of ref .  @xcite . for details , see refs .",
    "alice , the client , has a quantum device which emits randomly - rotated single qubit states and a classical computer .",
    "bob , the server , has a full quantum power .",
    "let us assume that alice wants to perform the cluster mbqc on the @xmath52-qubit graph state @xmath53 with measurement angles @xmath54 .",
    "if alice sends bob @xmath54 , and bob creates @xmath53 , the delegated quantum computation is of course possible . however , obviously , in this case bob can learn alice s privacy .",
    "hence they run the following protocol :    1 .",
    "alice sends bob @xmath52 randomly - rotated single - qubit states @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a random angle which is hidden to bob .",
    "2 .   bob applies @xmath19 gates among them .",
    "since @xmath19 commutes with @xmath58 , what bob obtains is @xmath59 , and the subscript @xmath60 of @xmath61 means the operator acts on @xmath60th qubit .",
    "3 .   for @xmath62 to @xmath52 in turn : 1 .   alice sends bob @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the modification of @xmath65 which includes appropriate feedforwardings ( byproduct corrections ) and @xmath66 is a random binary .",
    "2 .   bob does the measurement in the @xmath67 basis , and returns the measurement result to alice .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this protocol is correct . here",
    ", correct means that if bob is honest alice obtains the correct outcome .",
    "in fact , if bob measures @xmath68th qubit in the @xmath69 basis , @xmath70 which means that bob effectively does the @xmath71 basis measurement with the error @xmath72 .",
    "the error @xmath72 just flips the bit of the measurement result , and therefore it can be compensated later .",
    "it was also shown that the protocol is blind  @xcite . here",
    ", blind intuitively means that whatever bob does , bob can not learn anything about alice s input , output , and algorithm .",
    "intuitive proof of the blindness is as follows : what bob obtains are quantum states @xmath55 and classical messages @xmath73 . hence bob s state is @xmath74 which means that bob can not learn anything about @xmath54 whichever povm he does on his system .    in order to guarantee alice s privacy ,",
    "the geometry of the graph @xmath75 must be secret to bob .",
    "there are three ways of doing it .",
    "first one is to use the brickwork state  @xcite .",
    "it is a certain two - dimensional graph state which is universal with only @xmath76 basis measurements for @xmath77 .",
    "second one is to implant a  hair \" to each qubit of the regular lattice graph state  @xcite .",
    "for example , let us consider the left graph state of fig .",
    "we can simulate @xmath17 measurement and any @xmath78 plane measurement on any blue qubit with only @xmath78 plane measurements on yellow and blue qubits .",
    "hence we can  carve out \" a specific graph state from the square lattice of blue qubits as is shown in the right of fig .",
    "third one is so called  the graph hiding technique \"  @xcite . by using this technique",
    ", alice can have bob prepare any graph state in such a way that bob can not learn the geometry of the graph .",
    "this technique is based on the simple idea that @xmath19 does not create entanglement if one of the qubits is @xmath79 or @xmath80 : @xmath81 therefore , if alice hides several qubits in @xmath79 or @xmath80 into the set of qubits she initially sends to bob , she can let bob create her desired graph state .",
    "since bob can not distinguish @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and eight @xmath82 states , bob can not know when he entangles qubits ( fig .",
    "[ hiding ] ) .        , whereas red qubits are @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "bob applies @xmath19 gates on all edges of the left graph , but actually he obtains the right graph state , and he does not know its geometry .",
    ", scaledwidth=25.0% ]",
    "now let us consider the cv blind protocol .",
    "we here describe the ideal version and later consider realistic situations .",
    "our protocol runs as follows :    1 .",
    "alice sends bob @xmath83 where @xmath84 is randomly chosen from @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "2 .   bob applies @xmath19 gates . 3 .",
    "alice and bob might choose  the brickwork \" ,  the hair implantation technique \" , or  the graph hiding technique \" .",
    "irrespective of their choice , we can assume without loss of generality that bob has the  encrypted \" cv graph state @xmath87    @xmath52-qumode cv graph state , and the subscript @xmath60 of @xmath88 means it acts on the @xmath60th qumode .",
    "4 .   for @xmath62 to @xmath52 in turn : 1 .",
    "let @xmath89 be alice s computational parameters , and let @xmath90 be the one including feedforwardings .",
    "alice sends bob @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is a random real number .",
    "2 .   bob applies @xmath94 on @xmath60th qumode and does the @xmath4 measurement on it .",
    "( or he directly measures @xmath95 of the @xmath60th qumode . )",
    "he sends the measurement result to alice .",
    "let us show the correctness of our protocol .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ blind ] ( b ) , which is the circuit representation of our protocol . since @xmath42 commutes with @xmath19 , fig .",
    "[ blind ] ( b ) is equivalent to fig .",
    "[ blind ] ( a ) .",
    "note that the equivalence between ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ blind ] is based on only the commutativity between @xmath42 and @xmath19 , and therefore it holds even if we replace each input @xmath50 with its finitely squeezed version . hence , the finite squeezing does not cause any additional effect here .",
    "more precisely , note that the following is true for any state @xmath96 : @xmath97|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ & = & { } _ p\\langle p| \\exp[ir_jq ] \\exp\\big [ i\\big\\ { \\alpha_j'q + \\beta_j'\\frac{q^2}{2 } + \\gamma_j'\\frac{q^3}{3 } \\big\\ } \\big]|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ & = & { } _ p\\langle p| \\exp[ir_jq ] s_q^j(\\phi_j')|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ & = & { } _ p\\langle p - r_j| s_q^j(\\phi_j')|\\psi\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , bob effectively does the correct mbqc except for the fact that if the measurement result is @xmath4 , the byproduct which comes from this measurement is not @xmath98 but @xmath99 , which can be compensated by changing the following measurement parameters . since the above equation is true for any state @xmath96 , the situation does not change even if the squeezing is finite .",
    "the brickwork implementation for the cv blind protocol is shown in fig .",
    "[ brick ] , [ brick2 ] , and [ brick3 ] . since @xmath100 for the cv case , we can not directly generalize the qubit brickwork state of ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", we need @xmath19 and @xmath101 as is shown in figs .",
    "[ brick ] , [ brick2 ] , and [ brick3 ] .",
    "the hair implantation technique also works if we implant four - qumode hair on each qumode , since the measurement of @xmath3 on a qumode in a cv graph state removes that qumode  @xcite , and a @xmath3 measurement can be simulated only with @xmath102 measurements by using the following relations : @xmath103    the graph hiding technique for qubits can also be generalized to cv , since @xmath104 therefore , alice can have bob create a graph state where @xmath105 are applied on some qumodes in such a way that bob can not know the graph geometry .",
    "finally , let us consider the effect of the finite squeezing .",
    "as we have seen , the alice s prerotation technique itself is valid for any initial state ( fig .",
    "[ blind ] ) , and therefore the finite squeezing does not cause any additional problem apart from the original one inherent to the non - blind cv mbqc  @xcite . if alice and bob choose the brickwork implementation or the hair implantation technique , again the finite squeezing does not cause any additional effect since the brickwork blind quantum computation and the hair implantation technique are nothing but a normal cluster mbqc with some redundant gates .",
    "( of course , this redundancy accelerates the accumulation of errors , and therefore requires more fault - tolerance , but such a problem is not a specific problem to the blind cv mbqc .",
    "even the non - blind one ultimately needs enough fault - tolerance for the scalability  @xcite . ) finally , regarding the graph hiding technique , once the graph state is created , it is nothing but a usual cv mbqc with errors .",
    "if the squeezing is finite , eq .  ( [ cut ] ) becomes not exact but approximate one .",
    "this causes additional errors on the created graph state , but such errors are that even the non - blind cv mbqc can experience .    .",
    "blue two - qubit gate is @xmath19 .",
    "red two - qubit gate is @xmath101 .",
    "green triangles are byproducts . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    .",
    "the blue box means @xmath106 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    .",
    "the blue boxes are @xmath107 up to byproduct corrections .",
    "the purple box is @xmath108 up to byproduct corrections . ,",
    "what bob obtains are quantum states @xmath109 and classical messages @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "hence , bob s state is @xmath112 which means that bob s state is independent of @xmath54 .",
    "note that the blindness holds also in the finite squeezed case , since @xmath113 t^\\dagger_{\\omega_j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the operator @xmath114 commutes with @xmath42 .",
    "in optical systems , the implementation of @xmath115 is much harder than those of @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "hence it would be desirable for alice to avoid the implementation of @xmath115 by herself .",
    "there are two solutions .",
    "one is that bob embeds many @xmath118 with various @xmath119 into his resource state .",
    "if alice uses the hair implantation technique or the graph hiding technique , bob can not know which @xmath118 contributes to the computation .",
    "the other is to use the relation @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the squeezing and @xmath122 .",
    "since the squeezing can be done blindly , alice can have bob implement @xmath123 without allowing bob to learn @xmath124 .",
    "0      the direct implementation of @xmath19 is not practical since it does not conserve photon number , and requires the use of two single - mode online squeezers .",
    "since a cv graph state is a gaussian state , it can be create from offline squeezing and passive linear optics .",
    "if the state measurement is relatively easy , we can consider another blind quantum computation protocol , where bob creates the resource state and alice does the measurement  @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this protocol is that the security is guaranteed by the no - signaling principle  @xcite , which is more fundamental than quantum physics , and alice does not need to verify her measurement device ( the device independence  @xcite ) . the cv cluster mbqc is suitable for such a measuring alice protocol , since the measurements of @xmath125 are easily done with the homodyne detection . the gate @xmath48 can be implemented blindly by using eq .",
    "( [ cubicle ] ) .",
    "if we use the temporal degrees of freedom , only a single @xmath19 machine is sufficient  @xcite . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ time ] , it is easy to see that blind versions of such a temporal encoding implementation are possible both for the preparing alice ( fig .",
