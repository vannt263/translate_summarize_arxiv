    "fat - tailed distributions of connections characterize the complex architectures of many real - world networks @xcite .",

    "( degree is the total number of connections of a vertex . )",
    "the most popular concepts imply self - organization @xcite .",
    "the self - organization mechanism is responsible for fat - tailed distributions in a wide circle of evolving systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and not only in networks .",
    "usually , a very particular preferential attachment version of the self - organization mechanism is discussed , so that highly connected vertices preferentially attract new connections @xcite , but there are other possibilities . in this paper , we consider agglomeration as a competing possibility .",
    "it is known that aggregation processes effectively generate power - law distributions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an example ) . in networks ,",
    "the analogue is the merging of vertices . by this mechanism ,",
    "vertices accumulate their connections ( agglomeration of edges ) .",
    "this increases a number of highly connected hubs and so gives a chance to arrive at a fat - tailed degree distribution .",
    "evidently , the merging of vertices should take place in cellular networks ( merging proteins ) as well as in many other real - world networks .",
    "for example , in various networks of economic relations , merging and splitting of enterprises are basic elements of the evolution .",
    "the same is valid for networks of software components , electronic circuits , networks of relations between social groups , organizations , institutions , and parties , networks of subjects , networks of notions , etc .",
    "simple evolving networks with merging vertices have quite recently been simulated , ref .",
    "@xcite , and the generation of fat - tailed degree distribution has been successfully demonstrated .",
    "( for a similar process in bipartite graphs , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we provide a comprehensive description of the process of the creation of complex network architectures by the merge of vertices .",
    "it is impossible to obtain a uniform picture for all networks of this type .",
    "so , we describe a set of typical types of behaviors by considering a line of basic network models , which can be studied analytically .",
    "these models may be generalized in a natural way to include clustering and the condensation of clustering .",
    "many other variations are also possible .",
    "all the models that we study in this paper generate fat - tailed degree distributions .",
    "we consider both non - equilibrium networks with a fixed number of vertices , and networks , where this number grows .",
    "we use the mean degree @xmath0 of a network as a relevant parameter .",
    "then the variation of network architectures with @xmath0 is essentially characterized by the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "so , our main results are presented in the form : exponent @xmath2 vs. the mean degree @xmath0 .    in most of the networks in this paper",
    ", the evolution is due to two parallel processes : ( i ) the merging of vertices and ( ii ) random attachment of new vertices .",
    "however , we also discuss networks , where the second channel of the evolution is splitting ( fragmentation ) of vertices.the range of scenarios is wide , but in most of them we find a phase with the condensate of edges ( in other words , gelation ) . above some critical value @xmath3 of the mean degree",
    ", a finite fraction of edges is attached to a few vertices or to a single vertex .",
    "this condensation , unlike the situation described in ref .",
    "@xcite , occurs in the homogeneous networks . in the `` normal phase '' ,",
    "a degree distribution is of a power - law form , @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we observe that , rather unexpectedly , even in the condensation phase , normal vertices have a scale - free degree distribution .",
    "a resulting picture may be complicated by the presence of correlations , which is typical for non - equilibrium networks .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of degree  degree correlations , in the most succinct of these network models .",
    "the paper is organized as is follows . in sec .",
    "[ s - results ] , we describe the models and present in detail our results for each of them .",
    "the complete final information can be obtained from this section . in sec .",
    "[ s - derivations ] we present details of our analytical calculations and simulations .",
    "in this section we describe basic models of networks evolving due to aggregation processes and present our results . for sake of brevity we consider only undirected networks , i.e. , networks with undirected edges .",
    "this is the simplest model .",
    "the evolution starts from a given configuration of vertices and connecting edges .",
    "loops of length one are allowed . at each time step",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) :    * @xmath6 new bare vertices are added to the network . *",
    "two randomly chosen vertices merge .",
    "obviously , the final state of the network is a set of bare vertices plus a single vertex with all the edges ( actually , loops of length one ) attached .",
    "this is what we call the condensate of edges .",
    "the ( large ) number of vertices of this network , @xmath7 , does not change during the evolution .",
    "initially , there is an arbitrary configuration of @xmath7 vertices connected by some number of links . at each time step ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) :    * a new vertex is added to the network .",
    "this vertex is attached to a randomly chosen vertex . *",
    "two randomly chosen vertices merge .",
    "so , the result of the merging of vertices of degrees @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a vertex of degree @xmath10 .",
    "the total degree of the network linearly grows , @xmath11 , as well as its mean degree . network becomes more and more dense with time .",
    "the resulting degree distribution is of a power - law ( an asymptotics ) form with exponent equal to @xmath12 :    @xmath13    the main part of the distribution is stationary , but its low - degree part and a cut - off in the high - degree range change with time .",
    "this ensure the growth of the mean degree with time .",
    "condensation of edges is absent .",
    "note that we assume that this network is sparse . in principle , we allow multiple connections and 1-loops . however , we believe that in the sparse network regime , they are not important if we are not interested in the position of the cutoff of the degree distribution .",
    "this network was simulated earlier @xcite .",
    "our analytical results confirm the observations in ref .",

    "this is a growing version of model a. at each time step ( see fig .",

    "each of these vertices is attached to a randomly chosen vertex by @xmath15 edges .",
    "* two randomly chosen vertices merge .",
    "the total number of vertices now grows : @xmath16 .",
    "the total degree is @xmath17 .",
    "so , the average degree approaches the finite value @xmath18 .",
    "the condensation of edges is absent in this model . unlike model a , the stationary degree distribution of this growing network is a rapidly decreasing function . if , however , the rate of the growth is low , @xmath19 , then the power - law dependence ( [ e1 ] ) is realized in the range of degrees below a size - independent cutoff , @xmath20 .      in this growing network , at each time step ( see fig .  [ f4 ] ) :    * @xmath14 new vertices are added to the network . each of these vertices is attached to a randomly chosen vertex by @xmath15 edges .",
    "* simultaneously , a randomly chosen vertex merges with its randomly chosen neighbor , and the connecting edge disappears .",
    "rule ( 2 ) means the preferential choice : the second vertex in the network is chosen with probability proportional to its degree .",
    "the number of vertices and the total degree grow as @xmath16 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "so , the mean degree approaches the value    @xmath22    it turns out that if the network is sufficiently dense , namely if    @xmath23    than a finite fraction of edges is condensed on a single vertex ( or , maybe , on a few vertices ) .",
    "this takes place when the rate of the grows is low :    @xmath24    the fraction of edges in the condensate    @xmath25    behaves as @xmath26 near the condensation point ( see fig .",
    "one can see that all the edges are in the condensate in the limit of @xmath27 .",
    "( note , however , that we consider a sparse network . )",
    "one can easily understand this condensation phenomenon .",
    "for the evolution of the number of edges in the condensate , @xmath28 , that is , the `` macroscopic '' number of edges attached to the hub , one can immediately write the following equation :    @xmath29 \\ , .    \\label{e5a}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath30 is the total degree of the network , and the second factor on the right hand side of the equation is simply the mean degree @xmath31 of `` normal '' vertices ( i.e. , the hub is excluded ) minus @xmath32 . indeed , according to rule ( 2 ) of the model , the probability that the hub will be chosen for the merging is @xmath33 .",
    "each act of merging , in average , increases the number of connections of the hub by @xmath34 , which explains the form of eq .",

    "note that similar equations may be written for for networks with splitting vertices ( see below ) .",
    "`` normal vertices '' ( i.e. , with `` microscopic '' numbers of connections ) have stationary power - law degree distributions ( asymptotics ) both in the normal and in the condensed phases .",
    "the @xmath2 exponent of the degree distribution @xmath39 is    @xmath40    in the phase without condensate ( @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 ) and    @xmath43    in the condensation phase , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "[ f6 ] shows how the exponent of the degree distribution varies with the mean degree .",
    "note that in both phases , near the condensation point , @xmath46 .    in the critical point , the degree distribution has the form :    @xmath47    thus , this network is scale - free both is the normal and in the condensation phases .",
    "the power - law form of the degree distribution in the condensation phase is rather unexpected .",
    "let us explain this remark in more detail .",
    "a close analogy of the problem under consideration is the emergence of the giant connected component in a growing network , where a phase transition with the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless singularity takes place @xcite . in that case , the evolution equation for the size distribution of connected components is very similar to the evolution equation for the degree distribution in our case ( see the next section ) . in this analogy ,",
    "the giant connected component is analogous to the condensate of edges attached to a vertex , and the size distribution of finite connected components is analogous to the degree distribution in our case .",
    "the point is that the size distribution of connected components was found to be rapidly decreasing in the phase with the giant component ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while in contrast , in the present situation , the degree distribution is scale - free in the phase with the condensate .",
    "the paper @xcite was mainly devoted to the simulation of the `` static '' version of quite similar network without multiple connections and loops of length @xmath48 , @xmath49 with a growing number of connections , the sparse network regime .",
    "scale - free degree distributions with exponents exceeding @xmath32 , without any condensation , were reported .",
    "we do not consider precisely this situation here , since we focus on stationary degree distributions .",
    "these take place in the growing network .",
    "at each time step ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) :    * @xmath14 new vertices are added to the network . each of these vertices is attached to a randomly chosen vertex by @xmath15 edges . *",
    "simultaneously , the end vertices of a randomly chosen edge merge together , and this edge disappears .    at first sight , this model is close to model  c. the numbers of vertices and connections grow in the same way , and the mean degree is the same , eq .  ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is the way in which the merging vertices are chosen .",
    "one can treat this merging process as transformation of random edges with their end vertices into single vertices .",
    "in fact , there is an essential difference since now the choice of vertices , in principle , depends on correlations between the degrees of the nearest neighbor vertices in the network .",
    "let us compare models c and d once again :",
    "( i ) the evolution of model c produces degree - degree correlations but is not governed directly by them .",
    "( ii ) the evolution of model d depends on the degree ",
    "degree correlations and , in its turn , produces these correlations .",
    "strict calculations taking into account degree ",
    "degree correlations should be rather cumbersome .",
    "furthermore , in related networks , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , correlations have not been found .",
    "so , we applied a simplifying ansatz : we assumed that correlations may be neglected .",
    "= 69.5 mm    it turns out that with this assumption , equations for the degree distribution have a reasonable solution only if the mean degree of the network is below some value : @xmath50 or , equivalently , @xmath51 . in this region ,",
    "our calculations provide a power - law degree distribution .",
    "the @xmath2 exponent of this distribution approaches infinity at the minimal possible mean degree @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) and near @xmath3 behaves as    @xmath54    ( see fig .  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the behavior @xmath1 near the critical point of network c ( see fig .",
    "note the value @xmath55 of exponent @xmath2 at @xmath56 .    above @xmath3 , with our assumption that the correlations are absent , the only solution was found to be pathological .",
    "this proves the importance of the correlations in this network , which may be especially important in the condensation phase .",
    "for studying these degree  degree correlations , we resort to numerical simulations following the rules of model d. the degree distributions of the resulting networks are shown in fig .",
    "power - law - like degree distributions were observed both in the condensation phase and in the normal one .",
    "fitting has given values of the @xmath2 exponent slightly above @xmath55 at the studied values of the parameter @xmath37 .",
    "we obtained the dependence of the mean degree of the nearest neighbors of a vertex on the degree @xmath57 of this vertex , @xmath58 .",
    "of particular note here is that @xmath58 has to be computed with care : the loops of length 1 are not to be considered for the vertex whose nearest neighbors are under study .",
    "however , we take into account the nearest neighbors with one loops",
    ". this may be especially important in the condensation phase .",
    "the obtained dependences @xmath58 are shown in fig .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows :    * the network is correlated , and the degree ",

    "the merging of vertices is only one of processes in the networks under discussion .",
    "this process reduces the number of vertices , so other processes , increasing this number , must be present . in this paper , as a parallel process , we used an injection of new vertices ( with subsequent attachment to existing vertices ) and fragmentation ( splitting ) .",

    "are not known a priori and in the presence of degree correlations arise `` self - consistently '' .    as is natural , a uniform picture for all networks created by aggregation processes",

    "however , the models that we have considered in the present paper , reveal a number of basic features :    * the aggregation easily generates network architectures where hubs play a profound role . *",
    "the aggregation often leads to gelation , or , in other words , to condensation of edges in these networks .",
    "we have found the condensation point at some mean degree value and have traced the variation of network structure in the normal and the condensation phases . *",
