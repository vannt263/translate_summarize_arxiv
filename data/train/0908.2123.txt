    "oscillatory processes of several minutes periods in stellar coronae are associated with large scale quasi  periodic pulsations ( qpps ) in flares .",
    "they were identified in x  ray stellar coronal flares ( mitra  kraev et al .",
    "@xcite ) and were later reported for the sun by foullon et al .",
    "shorter period qpps in the radio band are known since the early 70 s ( aschwanden @xcite ) .",
    "also , systematic intensity perturbations in post  flare loops could indicate that they are the result of evaporation / condensation , or rising / falling plasma flow cycles , caused by the efficient heating of the flaring plasma from the chromosphere ( de groof et al .",
    "this suggests that energy released by flaring pulsations can induce oscillatory loop trapped processes .",
    "many clear quasi  periodic phenomenon are believed to be associated with wave responses after chromospheric evaporation has taken place as the main initial matter inflow source for flare loops ( nakariakov et al .",
    "@xcite ) . recently , sigalotti et al .",
    "@xcite simulated the propagation and damping of localized impulsive perturbations in coronal loops considering different dissipative mechanisms in the linear limit . as the authors state there is still no consensus over the actual mechanisms from which the waves originate",
    "moreover , the importance of different damping mechanisms is not fully understand due to the fact that different theoretical scenarios can describe similar observational frames . in this paper",
    "we confine to the ideal mhd approach -allowing the consideration of nonlinear waves and shocks which give rise to initially non  dissipative damping mechanisms- to evaluate its capability to adjust observational scenarios .    in borgazzi and costa",
    "@xcite we could describe an observational framework of catastrophic evacuation or high  speed descending flow picture resembling other authors results e.g. kjeldseth - moe and brekke @xcite ; schrijver @xcite .",
    "an upwardly propagating pattern was also registered associated to other parts of the loop system .",
    "also , the frequent recurrence of longitudinal compressible oscillations ( e.g. in borgazzi and costa @xcite , a quasi  periodic iteration of the event occurred 3 times in 1 h ) were proposed to be associated with either large wavelength slow magnetoacoustic waves or limit  cycle solutions . in costa and gonzlez",
    "@xcite we founded that limit cycle solutions associated with flow  based models are convergent with large wavelength wave  based models .",
    "magnetoacoustic modes having wavelength of the order of the loop structure describe a basic oscillation between the kinetic energy of the parallel plasma flows and the internal energy i.e. the thermal perturbation . the structure of the obtained mode is such that in half of the period the disturbance is always positive and the plasma emerges from the chromosphere while in the other half the plasma is negative and descending from the corona to the chromosphere .    in observational scenarios",
    "the dynamics is complex making it difficult to isolate the erratic flaring from the oscillations . thus , due to the simplifications that are assumed for simulating physical quantities ,",
    "the theoretical descriptions generally enables us to distinguish the behaviour of these components .",
    "due to the hight reynolds number of the corona it could be expected that a perturbation could give rise to a slow magnetoacoustic wave or a rising / falling mechanism that iterates before it decays in a non  dissipative way .",
    "our intention is to provide a more accurate description of flaring multi ",
    "loop systems which exhibit a combined behaviour , sliding down and upwardly propagating appearance , to analyze the plasma dynamics interior to the loops and its relation with the flaring event , i.e. whether the oscillatory patterns -which could be associated with mhd waves and/or limit  cycle flow solutions in coronal structures- could be associated to internal or external driving mechanisms . as internal mechanism we refer to the development of non  dissipative second standing acoustic modes believed to be responsible for the induction of qpps . these qpps can be understood in terms of acoustic auto ",
    "oscillations , similar to the auto ",
    "oscillations in an electric  circuit generator ( tsiklauri et al .",
    "the other alternative implies that the qpps are the resulting features of the external forcing produced by the flaring event .",
    "the basic mhd equations , the conservation of mass , conservation of momentum , energy balance , the magnetic induction equation together with a state equation , written in the so called conservative form result an hyperbolic  parabolic system of equations .",
    "the hyperbolic terms represent the convective effects and the parabolic ones the diffusive parts .",
    "these last terms are not considered in this paper so we work with an ideal mhd hyperbolic system of equations .",
    "we developed a 1d @xmath0 numerical technique that consists of an approximate riemann solver that allows to evaluate the variables inside each cell by means of the variation of the flows through the contour of the cell .",
    "the software that implements this numerical technique , has proven to be robust solving very demanding benchmarks such as magnetohydrodynamic riemann problems and hartmann flows .",
    "the mhd riemann problem solutions are compressible non - steady flows ; the hartmann flows are incompressible and steady - state flows ( elaskar , et al .",
    "@xcitea ; @xciteb ; maglione et al .",
    "thus , the technique is seen as a reliable computational tool for the description of mhd flows .    due to its accurate performance",
    "we apply the harteen  yee tvd technique ( total variation diminishing ) which is specially designed to capture discontinuities when dealing with supersonic flows and to achieve a second order approach where the solution is smooth ( yee et al .",
    "thus , the one non  dimensional equations considering non  stationary flow and written in conservative form are expressed as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the state vector of variables @xmath3 and the hyperbolic fluxes are @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 indicates de density ; @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the velocity components ; @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the components of the magnetic field vector ; @xmath13 is the pressure and @xmath14 the total non  dimensional energy is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ratio of specific heats .    in a quasi  linear form equation  [ 1 ] results @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the matrix associated with the jacobian fluxes , letter ` c ' indicates that the derivation is with respect to the conservative state variables .",
    "a simpler form of the jacobian fluxes is obtain as a function of the primitive variables @xmath19 equation  [ 5 ] in primitive variables reads @xmath20 with the transformation rule @xmath21 the conservative form ( eq .  5 ) is generally used for numerical purposes .",
    "they are appropriate to obtain accurate jump conditions at discontinuities and shocks ( leveque @xcite ) and they ensure that mass , momentum and energy are conserved . however , the eigenvalue and eigenvector manipulation is simpler in the primitive form ( eq .",
    "7 ) , thus we solve the mhd equations using the conservative form and the eigenvectors are evaluated by means of the primitive formulation .",
    "the resulting jacobian flux has a null eigenvalue implying that is not possible to use a riemann solver and thus an alternative jacobian flux must be implemented .",
    "we used a technique developed by powell @xcite and we obtained the primitive eigenvalues which resulted @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for entropic , @xmath24 for alfvn , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 for slow and fast respectively . the alfvn speed and the fast and slow speeds are respectively @xmath27 we normalized the eigenvectors following the proposal of zachary et al .",

    "in borgazzi and costa @xcite we studied a post  flare event occurred october 1st , 2001 which was imagined by both , trace space telescope ( transition region and coronal explorer , handy et al .",
    "@xcite ) and mica land telescope ( mirror coronagraph for argentina , stenborg et al .",
    "we described an observational framework of catastrophic evacuation or high  speed descending perturbations which resembles qpps as it was repeated 3 times in 1 h. an upwardly propagating pattern was also registered associated to other parts of the loop system . different hypothesis are given in literature to justify why alternatively upward or downward evolving features are not seen ( see the discussion in borgazzi and costa , @xcite and references therein ) . figure  [ fig : uno]a shows the location of brightening as a function of time measured over a virtual axis that extends along a whole complex loop i.e. a compound system of neighboring coronal isolated threads which exhibit a coherent behaviour .",
    "the origin of the axis was taken at the loops northern foot and the distance was measured along the loop , considering that due to the location of the loop system and to the rough accuracy of the method projection effects could be discarded .",
    "the figure shows the sliding down of brightening features from the apex or bifurcation point towards both legs of the loop .",
    "figure  [ fig : uno]b shows the superposition of events occurred in the same loop system at different sub  intervals of time .",
    "the coherence is due to the fact that the figure represents the spatial and time behaviour of several apparently isolated tubes .",
    "moreover , as we found that there was a time correlation between relative maxima when comparing different structures of the same active region we suggested that the large longitude chromospheric coherence founded i.e.@xmath45 , must be associated with the forcing from the basis of the whole active region due to the intermittent flaring . however",
    ", this is not conclusive , recently nakariakov et al .",
    "@xcite developed a model that shows that qpps observed in a flaring loop can be triggered by mhd oscillations in another loop situated nearby , not necessarily magnetically linked with the flaring one , and thus giving another possible explanation for the coupling of oscillations in an active region .",
    "solar coronal conditions with large reynolds numbers are well fitted by ideal mhd plasma models ( i.e. infinite electrical conductivity @xmath46 leading to vanishing viscosity and ohmic dissipation ) .",
    "we assumed that sources and sinks compensate each other , so the adiabatic energy equation holds , to investigate if the reiteration of features ( figure  [ fig : uno]b ) can be associated with the internal dynamics of the plasma , i.e. , the second spatial harmonic of the acoustic mode which is believed to be responsible for qpp associated with flaring events ( tsiklauri et al .",
    "these undamped long wavelength solutions can be also thought of as limit cycles .",
    "these are nearly longitudinal magnetoacoustic modes that describe a basic oscillation between parallel plasma kinetic energy and plasma internal energy with a characteristic length of @xmath47 the length of the loop resulting in the balance between radiative losses and thermal conductive flux ( costa and gonzlez @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , the reiteration of features could be associated to an external forcing from the chromospheric basis .",
    "this solution is generally suggested by the chromospheric coherence observed in the dynamics of many coronal events ( e.g. borgazzi and costa @xcite ; martnez et al .",
    "@xcite ) . of course",
    ", this description is not able to reproduce limit cycle models of the type proposed by kuin and martens @xcite which are associated with the generation and absorption of heat in open loop systems , neither the model proposed by muller et al .",
    "@xcite via the assumption of different radiative loss functions , not taken into account here .",
    "firstly our intention is to reproduce an individual observational scheme .",
    "and secondly we investigate if the reiteration of features could be explained by an internal triggered mechanisms or if it requires an external forcing one . in the frame of this model",
    "the role played by the magnetic field is mostly to guide the plasma flow , so the simulations are performed varying the thermodynamical quantities of the loop in appropiate coronal and chromospheric ranges .",

    "we describe the spontaneous evolution of the system from this static initial condition ; the initial speed value used is @xmath67 cases i and iii can be associated with cold models and thus short loops . in the frame of this model , the fact that the case that adjust observations results from initial constant density reinforces the hypothesis of homogeneous density distribution of most loops . figure  [ fig : tres]a shows the evolution of the density front for different time steps . figure  [ fig : cuatro]a is obtained from figure  [ fig : tres]a assuming that the maximum of the perturbed density is a tracer of the observational features .",
    "we also obtain a resulting transverse magnetic field component smoothly modulated by the density front ( the amplitude of the perturbed field is @xmath68 of the non  perturbed one ) .",
    "however , following the classification by nakariakov and verwichte @xcite as the mode does not produce any noticeable perturbation of the loop minor radius it will be considered as a longitudinal mode , i.e. , the magnetic field plays the role of being the wave guide of a fundamentally hydrodynamic shock",
    ".    a more detailed description can be obtained from figure  [ fig : cinco]a - b and from the wave analysis provided by the numerical techniques used .",
    "the figure displays the time steps number @xmath48 ( @xmath69min or @xmath70 @xmath71 is the acoustic transit time along half of the loop ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath72min or @xmath73 ) respectively .",
    "time step @xmath74 corresponds to @xmath75 figure  [ fig : cinco]a shows two descendant shock wave fronts ( @xmath76 ) , two descendant contact discontinuities ( @xmath77 ) and two descendant expansion waves ( @xmath78 ) . as the shock travels , the temperature , the density and magnetic field values are increased making the energy rise to values that could allow the observational detection .",
    "note that the observation of moving brightening requires that these features must be time and spatially localized and thus , to make the detection possible , the density and temperature must be abruptly diminished again to compound a brightening feature .",
    "this effect is provided by the contact discontinuities which is recognized because the pressure and the velocity of the flow are not changed while the wave passes .",
    "the expansion waves are recognized because they diminish the density and pressure values . from the comparison of time",
    "step @xmath48 and time step @xmath53 ( cases @xmath24 and @xmath79 of figure  [ fig : cinco ] ) , we see that the expansion wave has a larger speed than the contact discontinuity , i.e. when the expansion wave reaches the contact discontinuity the density and the pressure of the whole wave system is diminished . from figure  [ fig : tres ] we also note that the expansion waves have initially an ascendant phase ( compare the density distribution at the loop center of steps @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the figure ) ; the waves collide at the center and then travel downwards .",
    "figure  [ fig : cinco]b shows for time step @xmath53 the position of the descendant shock fronts ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "also , the expansion waves have interacted with the contact discontinuities and lowered the density and pressure leaving behind a coupled nonlinear system of waves , i.e. , the features located at @xmath83 in figure  [ fig : cinco]b can no longer be interpreted as contact discontinuities .",
    "* asymmetric case *    to simulate the asymmetry in the location of the bifurcation point of figure  [ fig : uno]a - b we assume @xmath84 which is in correspondence with the asymmetrical dynamical geometry of the loop system , see figure  [ fig : uno]a .",
    "the aim is to reproduce the downward branch slopes of figure  [ fig : uno]a , taking into account that to make the signal detectable the maxima must be higher than the background intensity value , e.g. figure  [ fig : tres]b .",
    "starting from the non - dimensional symmetric case , the pressure and density of the segments @xmath85 are changed to reproduce the slopes .",
    "the slopes result strongly sensitive to variations of the density , i.e. , note from figure  [ fig : tres]b that higher background densities ( right line starting at @xmath86 ) imply lower wave speeds ( compare the speed of the right and left perturbations ) .",
    "we obtained few cases that could reproduce the conditions .",
    "the new non  dimensional initial condition values of segments @xmath87 that adjusted the observations were @xmath88 pressure @xmath89 and @xmath90 . figure  [ fig : cuatro]b is obtained in the same way than in the symmetric case , assuming that the maximum of the perturbed density is a tracer of the observational features .",
    "the observational curve is superimposed over the numerical one showing good accordance between them .    in the frame of this first model ,",
    "it is not possible to give account for the reiteration of the brightening features of figure  [ fig : uno]b . as a consequence of the low density values produced by the pass of the expansion wave ,",
    "the temperature and density acquire very low values in the back front which are not recovered in the ascending phase . in all cases ,",
    "the evolution from initial values systematically show a deep vacuum at the back front , i.e. , density and temperature diminish to almost @xmath91 of the initial background values .",
    "this can also be seen from figure  [ fig : tres ] , the center values are lowered below the background density .",
    "however , to investigate if the low density region could be narrowed we vary the @xmath85 partition . in this case",
    ", we obtain that the slope of the curve remained the same as in figure  [ fig : cuatro]a and the vacuum region is narrowed but could not be lowered more than @xmath92 of the total length , e.g. , for @xmath93 the low density region covers @xmath94 of the center of the loop .",
    "moreover , the fact that figure  [ fig : uno]b shows only descendant features and not ascendant ones could be associated with the instrumental resolution that provides a limit value to the detection of the density .",
    "this implies that the density associated with the brightening of all the observed descendant branches must be higher than the ascendant ones , and last ones presumably not detectable ; this fact could not be reproduced by the numerical simulation of this model . in costa",
    "@xcite we show that the pass of this type of non  linear waves form a vacuum tail that can give account of the so  called tadpole phenomenon .",
    "the different branch speeds of an individual phenomenon were adjusted changing the initial conditions , as in the first model approach given in subsection  ( 4.1 ) , but it was not possible to reproduce its iteration . to reproduce the sliding down features , as in figure  [ fig : uno]b we decided to investigate the second triggering mechanism proposed .",
    "this is the chromospheric forcing from the loop footpoints produced by a transient oscillation associated with individual flare burst .",
    "the possible forcing functions are limited by the fact that they must reproduce the speeds and cadences of figure  [ fig : uno]b .",
    "the temporally and spatially localized impulse deposition , resembling a mass injection in the bases of the loop , was switched off before the start of the simulation .",
    "thus , the forcing must be considered as a boundary condition imposed to an homogeneous loop , i.e. , with initial non  dimensional density @xmath95 and temperature @xmath96 figure  [ fig : seis]a shows the density variation obtained assuming the action of one individual flare burst modeled by a forcing function @xmath97 with @xmath98 and the frequency @xmath99 which corresponds to a deposition of energy of @xmath100 on a typical loop .",
    "the value @xmath101 represents a dimensional characteristic time of @xmath102 the @xmath85 partition used is the same as in the first symmetric case .",
    "all the descendant branches have larger values of the perturbed density than the ascendant ones .",
    "the difference varies between @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( for the non  dimensional @xmath105 value varying between @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) and thus , if the model is accurate , i.e. , only the descendant branches are detected , an intensity threshold @xmath108 can be numerically obtained .",
    "in fact , in the euv and x - ray band , the emission intensity is modulated by the density perturbations as @xmath109 @xmath110 and the threshold can be estimated by the above relation .",
    "@xmath111 is the background density , @xmath112 the perturbed density , @xmath113 and @xmath114 means ascendant and descendant respectively . taking into account the numerical results , i.e. , non  dimensional densities @xmath115 and @xmath116 we obtain a mean value of @xmath117 with a @xmath118 and @xmath119 figure  [ fig : seis]b is obtained from figure  [ fig : seis]a using the intensity threshold @xmath120 to resemble the observational features , i.e. , with only descendant branches .",
    "the ascendant branches are more intense than the descendant ones , however , extended ascendant features ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) can be distinguished at the location of chromospheric feet in figure  [ fig : seis]b .",
    "these features are correlated with the accumulation of observational points at the chromospheric footpoints in figure  [ fig : uno]b and could be indicating the wave front bouncing .",

    "the two descending shocks are at @xmath144 and @xmath145 at the center the nonlinear interaction of waves lowers the density . only descendant shock features are detected due to the density threshold .",
    "the density profile at @xmath146 is shown in figure  [ fig : siete]c . again , at the center the density is lowered due to the continue nonlinear interaction of waves .",
    "only ascendant features from last rebound are detectable due to the density threshold @xmath147 figure  [ fig : siete]b and figure  [ fig : cinco]a have common sharp edges features indicating the presence of shock fronts . from figure",
    "[ fig : siete]c and figure  [ fig : cinco]b we see common regions formed by interaction of waves near the bases ; the interaction of waves finish smoothing out the density profiles .",
    "the differences on the correspondent shapes are related with the differences in the triggering mechanisms ( the spontaneous evolution vs. external forcing from the bases ) , however , the resulting cadences and characteristic speeds are the same as the observational ones .",

    "we noted that the increasing of @xmath159 corresponds to more pronounced curves of the descending branches and that more complex patterns can be obtained depending on @xmath162 the number of individual flare burst chosen and the time distance between them , @xmath163 taking into account the approximations we assumed and the numerical simplifications of the model we note that the values obtained are in good agreement with the observational values .",
    "the evaluation of the relative importance of the parameters and initial conditions to produce different patterns that could be compared to observations together with the consideration of nonideal contributions will be a matter of a new work .",
    "a few words with respect to the consideration of diffusive terms in the equations must be added .",
    "longitudinal modes can be affected by the thermodynamic properties of the medium . however , the fact that this type of modes is selectively seen in hot loops , where the mode damping is strongest , remains an open question .",
    "the scenario we are dealing with shows that nonlinear wave interaction processes are responsible of smoothing out sharp edges in a non  dissipative regime .",
    "this suggests that we are describing the stage where a non  dissipative transfer of energy from the large spatial scales to the small ones is predominantly at work before the small scales allow an efficient action of dissipation .",
    "a novelty of this work is that it proposes that the description in terms of shock waves is more common that what it was supposed .",
    "low @xmath164 value media have larger values of the alfvn speed than the sound speed .",
    "these two characteristic parameters of the coronal plasma determine the type of processes and energies associated to them that can be involved in its dynamics .",
    "the fact that in general , depending on the @xmath164 value , the sound speed is the smallest one suggest that it must not be unusual that compressional perturbations reach shock wave speeds .",
    "inhomogeneous features in the medium can easily couple the transverse alfvenic component with the longitudinal one and thus transfer energy to the acoustic mode allowing that hydrodynamic shock waves , guided by magnetic fields , can propagate .",
    "we have integrated the mhd ideal equations of a slender flux tube to simulate the internal plasma dynamics of coronal post - flare loops .",

    "our intention was to analyze the plasma dynamics interior to postflare loops and its relation with flaring events , i.e. whether the oscillatory patterns could be associated to internal or external driving mechanisms .",
    "this is , whether non  dissipative second standing acoustic modes could be responsible for the induction of qpps or if they are resulting features of an external forcing produced by the flaring event .",
