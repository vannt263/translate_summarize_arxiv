    "since shor s factorization program was proposed , many studies have been carried out with a view to realizing the quantum computer @xcite .",
    "although coherence is necessary for a quantum calculation , it is considered to be difficult to maintain coherence in the entire calculation process throughout the entire circuit .",
    "thus , it will be more efficient and more realistic to combine the quantum computational circuit and the conventional lsi circuit in the same chip .",
    "some proposals regarding the quantum computer based on semiconductor physics have been made from this viewpoint@xcite .",
    "kane@xcite proposed the si - based quantum dot computer using nmr of dopants ( phosphorus ) .",
    "this idea is very promising because the qubits are isolated from the external environment which causes decoherence .",
    "however , controlling the implantation of phosphorus exactly into the definite positions of the si substrate will depend on future technology and the usage of the magnetic field seems to be undesirable in the conventional si lsi circuit . here ,",
    "we propose a coupled quantum dot system of a quantum computer which can be operated only by electrical effects and show that it can operate as a controlled - not - gate .",
    "it is shown to be realized by developing the technology of a single - electron memory of si nanocrystals@xcite .",
    "the controlled - not operation is given by@xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 shows a _ control qubit _ and @xmath2 shows a _",
    "target qubit_. the value of @xmath1 remains unchanged whereas that of @xmath2 is changed only if @xmath3 .",
    "this operation is important because it acts as a measurement gate and produces the entanglement@xcite which plays an important role in quantum cryptography gates@xcite . in this paper",
    "we show the quantum gates of the semiconductor coupled quantum dots , emphasizing their controlled - not operation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : c_not ] the basic idea of this paper is presented and the static and dynamic properties of the coupled quantum dots operating as a quantum gate are discussed . in sec.[sec : discussion ] we estimate the decoherence time in the quantum operation and the measurement time in the detection process of the proposed coupled quantum dot system .",
    "we also discuss the fabrication process of the coupled quantum dot system .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "coupled quantum dot systems with a few electrons have been extensively investigated in regard to many - body effects such as coulomb blockade @xcite . from the experiments by van der vaart@xcite",
    ", it can be seen that the electron transfer between dots occurs when the discrete energy - level of one of the dots matches that of the other dot of the coupled dots .",
    "et al._@xcite showed theoretically that , as a result of the correlations between a few electrons in quantum dots , the electrons behave as if they were noninteracting electrons . crouch _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that , if the tunneling barrier is low and the coupling of the two dots is strong , the coupled dots behave as a large single dot in a coulomb blockade phenomenon .",
    "this means that , if the tunneling barrier between the dots is sufficiently small , it is possible that only one electron exists in the coupled dots .",
    "thus , we can consider the electronic state of the two coupled dots in the range of the free electron approximation@xcite at the first step of investigation .",
    "when two dots of different size are coupled and one excess electron is inserted , the system can be treated as a two - state system where the energy - levels of the total coupled dot system show the localized state of wave function reflecting the different energy - levels of the independent isolated dots@xcite . when gate bias voltage is applied and the potential slope is changed , there appears a gate bias voltage , @xmath4 , at which the two energy - levels of the original single dots coincide and the electron transfers to another dot ( resonant tunneling ) .",
    "coupling removes the degeneracy of energy - levels in the single dot quantum states , and produces new states of delocalization such that the even - parity and odd - parity wave functions spread over the two coupled dots .",
    "thus , if we regard the perfect localization of the charge in one of the coupled dots as @xmath5 state and that in the other dot as @xmath6 state , we can constitute _ qubit _ by the coupled quantum dots ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the point is , by adjusting the gate bias , we can control the electronic state from the localized regions ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) to the intermediate delocalized region only where the electron transfers from one dot to the other in the coupled dots in a short time ( @xmath9 picosecond)@xcite .",
    "as the tunneling barrier structure is asymmetric , the leak current through the coupled dot system is extremely small@xcite and neglected actually .",
    "when the above coupled dots ( qubits ) are arrayed side by side , the charge distribution of the electron in a qubit changes the potential profiles and the energy - levels of the neighboring qubits by its electric field .",
    "we assume that the electron transfer between different qubits can be neglected .",
    "then the electronic state in a qubit is affected by whether the electrons in other qubits stay in the @xmath5 state , @xmath6 state or arbitrary superposition state of @xmath5 and @xmath6. by changing the charge distribution of the array of qubits , we can operate the total charge distribution of the electrons and the quantum circuit .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the case of the two - qubit controlled - not - gate where one set of the coupled dots operates as a _ control qubit _ and the other as a _ target qubit_. later , it is shown numerically that this array of the coupled quantum dot operates as the controlled - not - gate .",
    "one of the candidates for the coupled dots of the quantum computer is considered to be the si nanocrystals embedded in the gate insulator ( fig.[example ] ) .",
    "this is based on the si lsi technology similar to that of tiwari s single - electron memory@xcite which is extensively investigated because it operates at room temperature .",
    "the excess charge is supplied from the inversion layer in the substrate . by setting larger dots near the channel , the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can be realized .",
    "the arrangement of the gate electrodes which control the individual qubits depends on the individual algorithm .",
    "the simplest form is the case where there are two gate electrodes and two sets of coupled dots ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , which works as the controlled - not - gate explained in this paper .",
    "the _ measurements _ process is operated by the upper gate electrode which controls the overall channel carrier density .",
    "the upper gate also protects the electronic states in the dots from disturbance by shielding the external electromagnetic field .",
    "the qubits interact mutually and the distribution of the charges affects the current flow ( channel conductance ) between the source and drain and the threshold gate voltage .",
    "a @xmath10 state shifts the threshold voltage most and a @xmath11 state shifts it least .",
    "because of the sloping channel depth from the source to the drain , the @xmath12 state and @xmath13 state can be distinguished .",
    "thus the quantum mechanical calculation proceeds as follows : ( 0)to _ initialize _ the charge distribution ( initial quantum states ) , a large voltage is applied on the upper gate over the coupled dots , and unifies the charge distribution in the coupled dots , ( 1)the input and output signals are added through the gates over each qubit , ( 2)the final distribution of charges ( final quantum states ) is detected by the current between the source and drain and the threshold voltage shifts of the upper gates over the coupled dot system .",
    "when there are many qubits , the controlled - not operation of pairs of qubits is affected by the quantum states of the surrounding qubits .",
    "that is , the applied gate voltage of operation changes depending on the quantum states of other qubits .",
    "this is the same situation as the qubits of barenco _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "although the decoupling schemes used in nmr experiments can be applied to avoid the coupling between qubits , it is considered to be desirable that the general quantum calculations are designed by considering the arrangement of qubits@xcite .",
    "this structure of the proposed system has the merit that the charge distribution in the coupled dot system , which is considered to be a very small signal , is expected to be detected by the channel conductance with high sensitivity like that of the single - electron memory@xcite .",
    "similar to tiwari s single - electron memory , the charging effect appears between the coupled dots and the channel region and the probability that two electrons come into the qubits is very small as long as the capacitance of the junction is sufficiently small .    in principle , the qubits by the semiconductor quantum dots with discrete energy - levels do not directly require that the quantum dots be asymmetric .",
    "two coupled quantum dots with discrete energy - levels can organize the two - state system .",
    "however , when the coupled dots are embedded in the fet - type insulating layer that we propose , the asymmetry of the coupled dots is required for the following two reasons .",
    "first , in order to prevent the electron in the coupled dots from returning to channel region in the substrate during the quantum operation , a finite voltage is required .",
    "the second reason is related to the measurement process . for the current to flow , a finite gate voltage that is larger than the threshold voltage",
    "is required . because , as discussed below , a large gate voltage breaks the coherent state of the coupled dots , much voltage can not be applied on the gate electrode .",
    "thus , it is desirable that the two discrete energy - levels of quantum dots coincide under the applied gate voltage and the quantum calculation and the measurement be carried out near the threshold gate voltage .",
    "these are the reasons why the asymmetry of the coupled quantum dots is required .",
    "below , we show the static properties of the wave function of the localized electron by using the s - matrix theory and the controlled - not operation of the coupled dots .",
    "the periodical motion of the localized electron is shown by solving a time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the exact theoretical treatment of the coupled dot system would be to solve the exact three - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "however , since this direct method is difficult to apply in practice , we use the following approximations . the static behavior is studied by solving the one - dimensional schrdinger equation , and the dynamic behavior , which is more difficult to treat , is studied by regarding the quantum dots as zero - dimensional objects .",
    "the static properties of the wave function in the coupled dots can be shown by applying the s - matrix theory@xcite to the one - dimensional case .",
    "the one - dimensional schrdinger equation is given : @xmath14\\psi_{i } ( z ) = e \\psi_{i } ( z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 show the number of the mesh in the calculation .",
    "it is well known that a relatively small number of @xmath16 is sufficient for the calculation ( here @xmath16 @xmath9 1000 ) .",
    "the electric fields by other coupled dots are considered to be included in the potential , @xmath17 .",
    "we use the plane wave approximation for the wave functions : @xmath18 the boundary conditions are given @xmath19 which determines the coefficient @xmath20 , @xmath21 : @xmath22= \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } ( 1+r_i)e^{ik_i x } &   ( 1-r_i)e^{-ik_i x } \\\\ ( 1-r_i)e^{ik_i x } &   ( 1+r_i)e^{-ik_i x } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_{i } \\\\   b_{i }   \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath23 . here",
    "we assume that the electron is inserted from the channel layer ( @xmath24 part ) and neglect the reflection amplitude of the wave function of the gate electrode ( @xmath25 ) , similar to ref.@xcite .",
    "then the transmission coefficient is given : @xmath26 .",
    "the coulomb interaction on the dot @xmath27 from the dot @xmath28 , and that from the dot @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath32 is the density of the wave function of dot @xmath33 and @xmath34 shows the distance between the center of the dot @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "we set @xmath36 or 1 depending on the existence of the localized electron of the neighboring qubits .",
    "the coulomb interaction on the dot @xmath37 is treated similarly .",
    "these coulomb interactions are added to the potential bottom of the target qubit . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the self - consistent effects .",
    "the localized electron in one of the coupled dots moves into the other dot only if the two discrete energy - levels are set close ( on resonance ) .",
    "the slight change of the relative energy - level by the electric field generated by the other set of coupled dots makes impossible the transfer of the localized electron from one dot to the other .",
    "the basic concept of this scheme is similar to that of barenco _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "whereas barenco _",
    "et al_. use the ground state and excited state in a single dot with optical resonant effects , we are using only the ground state of the coupled dots only with electrical resonant effects ( _ ground state operation _ ) .",
    "the smaller the size of the dot , the more stable is the operation .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the calculated results of the controlled - not operation in si / sio@xmath38(@xmath39 ) material .",
    "the barrier height of sio@xmath38 is assumed to be 3.1 ev and the effective mass of si and sio@xmath38 are assumed to be @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a mass of free electron . as the tunneling barrier is sufficiently high , the coupled dot system can be made smaller in the si / sio@xmath38 system than in the gaas / algaas system@xcite .",
    "the diameter of the larger quantum dot is 6 nm and that of the smaller is 4 nm where the thickness of the tunneling barrier is 1.5 nm .",
    "the distance between centers of the dots of the same size is assumed to be 20 nm ( 4@xmath42 10@xmath43 dots/@xmath44 ) .",
    "these values are taken from the experiments by tiwari _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "the thinner tunneling barrier between the dots in a qubit becomes ( @xmath45 1 nm ) , the weaker the rate of the localization effect is .",
    "electron in a target qubit is localized in a larger dot at lower gate bias region ( region @xmath46 in the case where control qubit is in @xmath5 state in fig.[fig4 ] ) . as the gate voltage is applied , the energy - level of the localization in the larger dot exceeds that of the smaller dot . at @xmath47 ( center of the left hatched region in fig.[fig4 ] ) , the wave function of the lowest energy state ( even - parity ) and that of the excited state ( odd - parity ) spread over the two dots with equal weight , when the control qubit is in @xmath48 state .",
    "the degenerate energy - levels of the single dots are split by the coupling of the dots and show the small energy difference , @xmath49 ( @xmath9 6.28 @xmath50 ev : which is not distinguishable in the figure ) .",
    "this resonant gate bias shifts toward the higher bias region in the case where the control bit is in @xmath6 state .",
    "this is because the electron in the control qubit is localized in a smaller dot and the band bottom of the smaller dot in the target qubit is raised ( fig.[fig5](b ) ) .",
    "thus , when we apply the voltage , @xmath51 , in a half time of the oscillation with time period , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 picosec ) , the electron moves between alternate dots only if the control qubit is in @xmath5 state and we can show the controlled - not operation in the coupled quantum dot system .",
    "note that the wave function shown in fig.[fig4 ] is the static one and dynamical properties can be easily discussed by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation@xcite as follows .",
    "the localized wave functions in a quantum dot @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the eigenenergies are expressed as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , which are assumed to be far apart from each other . then the coupled wave function is constituted by these wave functions as , @xmath60 the hamiltonian of the schrdinger equation , @xmath61 , is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63(=3.1 ev ) is a barrier height between the quantum dot @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this equation is easily solved and the eigenenergies are given as @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 ^ 2 + c_a c_b}$ ] .",
    "when the applied bias puts the energy - level of dot @xmath54 and dot @xmath55 at the same level and makes the two dots symmetric ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 when the time - dependent phase is removed by the interaction picture , this solution shows that it includes the not operation in quantum computing , one of the basic single qubit operations .",
    "in particular , when the charge is localized in one of the coupled dots in the initial state(@xmath74 , @xmath75 ) , we have : @xmath76 this shows that the localized electron moves completely between dot @xmath54 and dot @xmath55 with a period , @xmath77 .",
    "thus we can show the charge transfer is realized when we apply the voltage at which the energy - levels of the initially isolated dot coincide , which also corresponds to the case where the energy - level of ground state and that of the excited state of the coupled dots approach most closely ( hatched area in fig.[fig4 ] ) , in the time period of @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , in the case of a different initial condition of charge distribution , @xmath78 /@xmath79 is realized as a static state .",
    "time spent for the transfer of the charge in a coupled quantum dot is given as @xmath80 with : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an average width of the quantum dot (= 5 nm ) , @xmath83 ( = 1.5 nm ) is the width of the tunneling barrier between the two dots , @xmath84 and and @xmath85 is the energy of incident electron .",
    "we obtained @xmath86 12 picosec in the case of fig.[fig4 ] , which is longer than the time obtained above(@xmath87 ) .",
    "this is because this time - dependent approach numerically identifies the exact results when the two dots are far apart@xcite . in any event",
    ", this numerical mismatch never changes the physical aspects of the coupled dot system .",
    "although the speed of the operation becomes faster as the tunneling barrier between the coupled dots in a qubit becomes thinner , the wave function of the qubit of thin tunneling barrier does not localize sufficiently . in the case of our calculation of sio@xmath38 ,",
    "the criterion of the minimum thickness of the tunneling barrier is considered to be around 1 nm , where the switching speed is estimated to be sub - picosecond .",
    "below , the switching speed is also discussed in relation to the measurement time .",
    "here we roughly estimate the decoherence time in quantum computation of the proposed coupled dots embedded in the sio@xmath38 material based on the results by leggett _",
    "et al._@xcite . during the quantum computation ,",
    "the voltage between the source and drain is kept zero and there is no flow of the detecting channel current .",
    "the decoherence in this case is considered mainly to originate from the phonon environments .",
    "the sio@xmath38 is a polar material and the optical phonon mode ( @xmath9 0.153 ev ) will be the major dissipation mechanism of the high temperature and high energy region . here , we consider the low temperature region where only the acoustic phonons play the major role in the decoherence mechanism .",
    "the effects of this dissipative environment on the two - state system is treated by the infinite bath of harmonic oscillators of acoustic phonons ( spin - boson hamiltonian ) where the interaction term between the two - state system and the acoustic phonons is derived from that of the amorphous sio@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the spectral function , @xmath88 , is given in the debye approximation as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 10 ev , @xmath91 4300 m / sec , @xmath92 2200 kg / m@xmath93 , @xmath94 0.5 nm , @xmath95 are a deformation potential , a sound velocity , a density , a lattice constant , and a dimensionless parameter , respectively .",
    "here , we use the value of the deformation potential of the electrons in the bulk si , because in the model of ref.@xcite , the particle in the two - state system is assumed to be an atom .",
    "the first term of eq.([eqn : spectral ] ) is the superohmic part and the second is the ohmic part . from ref.@xcite , the temperature where the ohmic part appears",
    "is estimated to be less than mk .",
    "first we estimate the decoherence time of the superohmic term . here",
    "we treat the case of no bias and denote the bare tunneling frequency as @xmath96 . according to leggett _",
    "et al._@xcite , the two - state system without bias voltage shows the underdamped @xmath97 oscillation where the damping rate , @xmath98 , at @xmath99 , is given as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the renormalized form of the bare tunneling frequency , @xmath102 , defined as @xmath103 when we take the above parameters of a - sio@xmath38 of ref.@xcite and cutoff , @xmath104 with @xmath105 450k , the value of the factor in the exponential is less than -10@xmath106 , which extremely reduces the value of @xmath101 ( @xmath107 ev in the above case ) . the decoherence time derived from the superohmic dissipation , @xmath108 , increases , as the @xmath101 decreases .",
    "the direct calculation of the decoherence time becomes more than seconds .",
    "this will be because the true microscopic values will be different from those used above , which will be partly the same situation as ref.@xcite .",
    "when we use bare tunneling frequency , @xmath102 instead of @xmath101 in eq.([eqn : decoherence_rate ] ) in order to estimate the shortest decoherence time at the present , @xmath109 4.8@xmath110 sec , during which thousands of quantum calculations can be realized in the proposed system where the one - step calculation is executed in a few picoseconds . because @xmath111 , this underdamped behavior persists up to the finite temperature ( see leggett et al.@xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to show the numerical behavior at the finite temperature , we need the microscopic material values which appear in eq.([eqn : delta ] ) .",
    "thus , we can not show the maximum temperature of operation limited by the above superohmic term here .    at low temperature region",
    "less than mk , ohmic dissipation should be considered .",
    "the dimensionless ohmic dissipation coefficient , @xmath112 , shows that in our case the _ coherent _ oscillations survive and the contribution of the incoherent part vanishes in this small @xmath113 regime ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these long decoherence times will originate from the high potential barrier(sio@xmath38 ) between the two coupled quantum dots .",
    "by contrast , the short transition time via acoustic phonons in the two - state model of glasses is estimated to be of the order of @xmath114 sec , which is derived from a low barrier height ( @xmath115ev ) and a short distance of the two states ( @xmath116 0.1 nm ) @xcite .",
    "these long decoherence times will be related with the phonon bottleneck of ref.@xcite and effects of phonons are different from those in the bulk@xcite .",
    "the promising results of the above estimation of the long decoherence time might be due to the simple two - state model of the ideal quantum dots apart from the question of the true microscopic values .",
    "when we consider the transitions to the excited energy - levels in each quantum dot ( about 0.018ev(@xmath9 210k ) above the ground state in the 10 nm si quantum dot ) , which will occur at higher temperature regions ( @xmath117 210k ) , it is possible that the desirable quantum operation will be limited . also , as the temperature rises , the effects of optical phonons can not be neglected and the decoherence time will be reduced by the energy exchange between the electron and the optical phonon modes . in particular , when the quantum gate is operated in the ac gate voltage mode of high frequency in a general quantum operation , the dipole of the charge distribution in the coupled quantum dots will be more strongly affected by the electronic environment and the decoherence time will be reduced .",
    "although there are many problems that need to be investigated in more detail , the above results show that the quantum computing in the semiconductor coupled quantum dots seems to be realizable from the viewpoint of one of the elementary steps of the investigation@xcite .",
    "next , the measurement process of the mosfet structure is discussed in more detail .",
    "we treat the linear region of channel current , @xmath118 , as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a transconductance of the fet , and @xmath121 is a threshold voltage .",
    "the change of the charge distribution in the coupled dots induces a shift of the threshold gate voltage , @xmath122 , which is measured through the variation of the detecting channel current , @xmath123 , by the field effect .",
    "the @xmath122 of a single qubit is given approximately by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the distance between the two dots in a qubit , and found to be of the order of a few tens of mev .",
    "this magnitude of the shift of the threshold voltage is found to be of a somewhat smaller order than that reported by guo _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath123 is given by @xmath126 .",
    "this measurement process is considered to be similar to that of a quantum point contact(qpc ) .",
    "the measurement process of the coupled dots by qpc has been intensively investigated@xcite .",
    "here we use the results of gurvitz@xcite .",
    "the measurement time , @xmath127 , at the channel current of @xmath118 , can be described as @xmath128 the behavior of the detector can be classified depending on whether @xmath129 or @xmath130 , where @xmath102 is the tunneling frequency of the electron in a qubit . the first case , @xmath129 ,",
    "is called a weak damping which implies that the electron oscillation in the qubit is faster than the detection and we will not be able to decide the position of the electron in a qubit .",
    "the second case , @xmath130 , is called a strong damping which implies that many electrons can flow through the channel region during an electron oscillation in a qubit . in the latter case",
    ", we can induce a zeno time , @xmath131 , and observe the position of the electron in the time interval between @xmath127 and @xmath132 by the continuous measurements by zeno effect .",
    "when we apply these arguments to the experiments of guo _",
    "et al._@xcite at @xmath133 mev , we have @xmath134 and @xmath135 sec @xmath136 ) , if @xmath137 ev .",
    "this shows that the measurement parameters in the results of ref.@xcite are not those of a good detection for @xmath137 ev .",
    "the @xmath120 can be simply increased by increasing the bias between the source and drain@xcite .",
    "these quantum - dot memories are considered to be prototypes , and , in the future , great improvement can be expected , for example , by reducing the resistive parasitics between the source and drain . however , when we would be unable to find a solution capable of improving the speed of transconductance by three orders , it would be necessary to reduce the speed of the gate operation , which can be controlled by the thickness of the tunneling barrier between the coupled dots , so as to realize better detection . in any events , the optimal speed of the gate operation will be able to be increased as the developing fabrication technology improves the measurement speed .",
    "lastly , we consider whether the set structure proposed by shnirman _",
    "et al._@xcite is more suitable for the measurement than the mosfet structure . if we adopt the set instead of mosfet , the josephson coupling energy , @xmath138 , of shnirman _",
    "et al._@xcite corresponds to our tunneling matrix element , @xmath139 , and their charging energy term corresponds to our bias term , @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "this is possible because the hamiltonian of shnirman _",
    "et al._@xcite is described by the two - state system , and their model is considered to be universal in the measurement process in quantum computing . in this case",
    "we have to reduce the @xmath141 to less than that of shnirman _",
    "_ in order to suppress the bias term in the coupled dots and prevent the breakdown of coherence of the two - state system .",
    "thus , the mosfet structure seems to be available for the read - out device of the semiconductor qubit system , although the strict comparison will be needed .",
    "moreover , problems may be ameliorated as the process technology of conventional lsi advances .",
    "the coupled dots ( qubits ) can be fabricated by applying the self - limiting oxidation process of si nanostructure@xcite .",
    "for example , the oxidation process after forming si nanocrystals on a thin amorphous si layer via sio@xmath38 thin film changes the amorphous si layer and leaves si dots only under the top si nanocrystals which also remain . thus forming the coupled dot system",
    "is more feasible than controlling donor atoms in substrates .",
    "the small fluctuation of the dot sizes is not serious because the on / off gate voltage can be adjusted to be initialized depending on each energy - level of each qubit .",
    "another concern is that interface traps may be another localized state and break coherence of the quantum calculation .",
    "however , the density of the trap state ( @xmath9 10@xmath142 @xmath143 ) is smaller than the assembly of the nanocrystals ( @xmath9 10@xmath43 @xmath143 ) .",
    "we have proposed a quantum computer based on the coupled dot system , which can be realized by developing the technology of the single - electron memory with si nanocrystals .",
    "the basic idea is ( 1 ) the electron is localized in one of the asymmetric coupled dots .",
    "( 2)the electron transfer takes place from one dot to the other when the energy - levels of the coupled dots are set close .",
    "( 3)the coulomb interaction between the coupled dots mutually affects the energy levels of the other coupled dots .",
