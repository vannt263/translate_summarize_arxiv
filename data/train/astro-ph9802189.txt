    "the forest clouds seen in spectra of quasars , which are crudely defined to have @xmath12 2 , were thought initially to contain primordial gas since no metal absorption lines were detected at their redshifts ( sargent et al 1980 ) . however , moderate - resolution spectra taken with much higher s / n ratios ( meyer & york 1987 ) provided the first evidence that some of these clouds , especially those with relative large equivalent width , do show weak absorption . by shifting to the rest frame and averaging the regions of hundreds of lines which did not show absorption individually ,",
    "lu ( 1991 ) provided a probably detection of absorption associated with these clouds at the @xmath13 m  level .",
    "subsequent high resolution , high s / n spectra taken with the 10 m keck telescopes ( cowie et al 1995 ; tytler et al 1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) have clearly revealed ( mostly ) weak absorption associated with individual clouds at @xmath14 with  as low as @xmath15 2 . specifically , it was found that essentially all clouds with @xmath16 2 show absorption , and that 50 - 75% of the clouds with @xmath17 2 show absorption .",
    "the presence of absorption in clouds with @xmath18 2 indicates that these clouds have been enriched in heavy elements at redshifts as high as @xmath19 .",
    "recent cosmological simulations of structure formation involving gas processes ( hydrodynamics ) suggest that the lines at @xmath20 represent low density gas in - between collapsed objects and are closely related to the formation of galaxies , clusters , voids , and other structures in the universe ( cen et al 1994 ; petitjean , mucket , & kates 1995 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al 1996 ; miralda - escude et al 1996 ) .",
    "an important issue is whether the metals seen in these intergalactic clouds were produced locally ( i.e. , produced by stars formed within the clouds , or ejected from nearby star - forming galaxies ) or were produced at a much earlier epoch in a wide - spread fashion ( i.e. , by population iii stars ; ostriker & gendin 1996 ) .",
    "if the metals in clouds were produced _ in situ _",
    ", one may expect that clouds in regions of space sufficiently far away from star - forming objects should be metal - free .",
    "whereas in the case of pop iii star enrichment , most of the universe may have been polluted to some degree and few clouds may be entirely metal - free . while it is not yet possible to directly see the spatial distributions of star - forming objects and clouds at high redshift , some insight is provided by cosmological simulations .",
    "these simulations indicate that clouds with @xmath21@xmath22 2 account for 40 - 60 % of the total baryons in the universe at @xmath23 ( miralda - escude et al 1996 ) , and that such clouds preferentially occupy the filamentary gaseous regions surrounding and connecting collapsed structures ( i.e. , galaxies ) .",
    "the simulations also indicate that clouds with @xmath10 2 predominantly occupy the void regions .",
    "these results lead to the idea that one can perhaps obtain clues about the origin of the metals by investigating the metal contents of the very low column density ( i.e. , @xmath10 2 ) clouds : the presence of any significant amount of metals in these clouds would favor the pop iii idea for the reasons discussed above .    in this paper we present the results of a search for absorption associated with clouds with @xmath24@xmath10 2 , using high resolution , high s / n quasar spectra obtained with the 10 m keck i telescope and the high resolution spectrometer ( hires ; vogt 1992 ) . given the low  of the clouds , it would be practically impossible to obtain spectra of quasars with sufficient s / n to detect the absorption in individual clouds even if the n()/  ratio remains the same as that in clouds with higher ( s / n at least a factor of 5 better than the current best spectrum would be required ) .",
    "the problem is compounded by the fact that the n()/  ratio is predicted to drop with decreasing  at @xmath10 2 as the clouds become more ionized ( e.g. rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "accordingly , the technique we adopt is the composite spectrum method pioneered by norris , hartwick , & peterson ( 1983 ) . essentially , one shifts a quasar spectrum into the rest frame of each absorption line and then averages the rest - frame spectra over the spectral region encompassing the @xmath31548.20 , 1550.77 lines to form a composite spectrum .",
    "the s / n in the composite spectrum increases roughly as the square root of the number of lines being averaged , making this a very effective way to achieve ultra - high s / n without using unrealistically large amounts of telescope time .",
    "the end result is then an average absorption associated with an ensemble of clouds .",
    "this technique has been applied previously to clouds to search for absorption by williger et al ( 1989 ) , lu ( 1991 ) , tytler & fan ( 1994 ) , and barlow & tytler ( 1998 ) , and to metal systems to search for o vi absorption by lu & savage ( 1993 ) .",
    "incidentally , this averaging process automatically suppresses any residual noise features in the spectra caused by imperfect flatfielding or other artifacts and is ideal for achieving ultra - high s / n in the averaged spectra .    in section 2",
    "we describe the spectra used in the analysis and the procedure for selecting lines with the desired column densities ( i.e. , ) .",
    "the composite spectra for various samples of clouds are discussed in section 3 .",
    "no absorption is detected in any of the composite spectra , thus yielding only upper limits to the metallicity of the clouds . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the nature of the metal enrichment in the clouds .",
    "we briefly summarize our main conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the list of 9 quasars whose spectra are used in the analyses is given in table 1 .",
    "these objects are selected because their spectra have the highest s / n among all @xmath26 quasars observed by the current authors with the keck hires .",
    "the objects have emission redshifts between 2.58 to 3.63 .",
    "the integration times range from 4 to 11 hours .",
    "the data were reduced using the ee package developed by t. barlow .",
    "the typical s / n per resolution element ( 6.6 ) in the region for each spectrum is given in the 4th column of table 1 .",
    "our goal is to determine the metallicity of clouds with in the range of @xmath27 to @xmath28 2 via the @xmath3 1548.20 , 1550.77 absorption .",
    "such clouds could be selected by fitting voigt profiles to all the lines in the spectra as is commonly done . since",
    "such profile fitting has not been done to all of the spectra listed in table 1 and indeed would be quite time consuming to carry out , we instead selected lines in the desired column density range based on the observed depth of the lines at the line center .",
    "previous voigt profile fitting to forest absorption lines obtained with the keck hires indicate that the doppler width distribution of the lines at @xmath29 is sharply peaked at @xmath30 km / s with the vast majority of lines having @xmath31 between 20 and 50 ( hu et al 1995 ; lu et al 1996a ; kirkman & tytler 1997 ) . for a mean @xmath32 , the central optical depths corresponding to the limiting  of @xmath27 and @xmath28 2 are 0.96 and 3.03 .",
    "the corresponding absorption lines should have a residual flux between 0.384 and 0.048 at the line center for unity continuum ( note that the lines are completely resolved at the hires resolution of fwhm=6.6 for the assumed @xmath31 value ) .",
    "we therefore selected clouds with by visually selecting lines with residual flux between 0.384 and 0.048 after normalizing the spectrum to unity continuum . in order to avoid biasing the line sample , only spectral regions which have sufficiently high",
    "s / n to securely identify absorption lines with residual flux of 0.048 were used .",
    "the spectral regions actually used to select lines are given in column 5 of table 1 .",
    "the lower wavelength limit is determined either by the above s / n requirement or by the onset of ly@xmath33 emission of the quasar ( we do not use the spectral region shortward of ly@xmath33 emission in order to avoid mis - identifying ly@xmath33 and higher order lyman lines with ) .",
    "the upper wavelength limit is determined by the emission .    in many cases lines with the desired optical depth ( i.e. , residual flux between 0.384 and 0.048 )",
    "are blended with other lines .",
    "if the blending is severe enough , two problems arise : ( 1 ) the blending makes it difficult to determine an accurate redshift for the absorption line ; ( 2 ) the blending could lead to a significant overestimate of the h  i column density of the absorption lines . to avoid these problems",
    ", we excluded from the sample lines within 50 of other `` strong '' lines ( or something else ) that would have otherwise been included in the sample .",
    "a `` strong '' line is defined here to have residual flux @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath35 2 if it is a ) .",
    "the choice of 50 is somewhat arbitrary and is based on the observation that lines satisfying the above criterion do appear to have well - defined redshifts and largely fall into the desired column density range .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , while it is critical for the line sample to be unbiased with respect to the column density distribution so that the average  of the lines comes out to be what is expected ( see below ) , it is not necessary for the line sample to be complete .",
    "most of the metal lines occurring in the forest are easy to recognize owing to their narrow line width ( see , for example , kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "relatively broad metal lines that are strong enough to be mistaken as lines in the desired column density range are rare and are also easy to identify because they are usually associated with prominent metal systems .",
    "spectral regions that are severely affected by metal absorption lines were not used to search for lines .",
    "there are a few cases where the presumed lines have estimated width of @xmath36 , which could be lines but could also be unidentified metal lines ; these are assumed to be lines .",
    "since the number of such lines is very small ( @xmath37% ) , their effect on the final composite spectrum and on the interpretation should be negligible .",
    "the selection criteria we employed will occasionally include some lines with  outside the range of @xmath38 2 and exclude some other lines within the desired column density range if the actual doppler widths of the lines are significantly different from the assumed mean of 25 .",
    "for example , a line with @xmath39 and residual flux 0.384 ( i.e. , barely strong enough to be included in the sample if it had @xmath32 ) would have @xmath40 2 but would still be included in the sample .",
    "on the other hand , a line with @xmath41 and residual flux 0.3 would have a = @xmath42 2 and would be excluded from the sample . however , because of the sharpness of the doppler distribution of the clouds , and because of the range of column densities considered , the vast majority of lines in the sample should have the desired  values .",
    "the only major effect of the above `` shuffling '' is to broaden the column density distribution of the selected lines .",
    "the mean  of the sample should be largely unaffected .",
    "kirkman & tytler ( 1997 ) have fitted voigt profiles to all lines in the hires spectrum of q1946 + 7658 which they took independently .",
    "it is therefore possible to examine the actual  distribution of the lines in the q1946 + 7658 spectrum that are included in our sample based on the above selection criteria using the results of kirkman & tytler .",
    "figure 1 shows this  distribution for the 47 systems which we have selected based on their optical depth .",
    "as expected , some of the systems ( 9/47 or 19% ) have  outside the desired range , and the extremes are @xmath43 and @xmath44 2 . the average  of the 47 lines included in the sample for q1946 + 7658 is @xmath45 2 based on the profile fitting results . the expected mean column density from the column density distribution , @xmath46 ( hu et al 1995 ; lu et al 1996a ; kirkman & tytler 1997 ) , is @xmath47 2 .",
    "note that the mean  is extremely robust .",
    "for example , if the power law index is 1.4 rather than 1.5 as assumed , the expected mean  becomes @xmath48 .",
    "the robustness of the mean  has to do with the fact that the total column density range considered here spans only a factor of 3 .",
    "the true mean  of any given sample will fluctuate according to the sample size .",
    "most of the samples we consider here ( table 4 ) contain between 126 and 282 lines .",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate that the 1@xmath49 dispersion in the mean  for samples of such sizes ranges between 0.006 and 0.013 dex for the assumed  distribution .",
    "the 1@xmath49 dispersion in the mean  for the sample with 27 lines is 0.028 dex , and that for the sample containing 12 lines is 0.04 dex .",
    "these uncertainties are very small .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the mean  of the actual samples will be somewhat larger than what the simulations indicate because of the `` shuffling '' effect discussed above .",
    "even so , the uncertainties associated with the mean  should be small compared to other uncertainties involved in the analysis ( e.g. , the ionization correction ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the simple selection procedure employed above does form a sample of lines with the vast majority of them having the desired range in , and that the average  of the sample is unbiased and can be estimated reliably from the known column density distribution .",
    "finally , we note that while line blending and blanketing effects can bias the observed  distribution of clouds , such biases are apprently negligible at the column densities we consider here ( see kirkman & tytler 1997 , for example ) .      before we formed the composite spectrum , we visually examined the region of individual systems in the sample to see if any of them have detectable absorption in the observed spectra .",
    "sixteen such systems were found , 6 of which form 3 close pairs ( @xmath50 ) and may be physically related .",
    "three of the 16 systems are marginal in the sense that only weak ( @xmath51 ) @xmath51548 absorption is detected and the corresponding @xmath51550 absorption is not apparent .",
    "we show in figure 2 these lines and the corresponding absorption .",
    "the properties of these systems are summarized in table 3 and are discussed in more detail in section 4.2 .",
    "these systems will be excluded from the composite spectrum analyses .",
    "nine of the 16 systems with detected  occur within 3,000 of the emission redshift of the quasars .",
    "it has been known for some time that there is in general an excess of metal absorption systems near @xmath52 of quasars , which are likely associated with material ejected from the quasar nuclei or in the host galaxies and their environment ( cf .",
    "foltz et al 1988 ) .",
    "we therefore classify these 9 systems as `` associated '' systems in table 3 .",
    "the remaining 7 systems are more than 10,000 away from the emission redshift of the background quasars ; these are classified as `` intervening '' in table 3 .",
    "most of the systems listed in table 3 show no detectable si iv absorption except for the two pairs of associated systems at @xmath53 toward q 1422 + 2309 and at @xmath54 toward q 2343 + 1232 , which happen to have ( perhaps not by accident ) the strongest  absorption among all systems given in table 3 .",
    "the @xmath55 system toward q 1422 + 2309 has a marginally significant si iv @xmath51393 absorption without obvious @xmath51402 absorption .",
    "of the 7 intervening systems , 4 are within 500 of other absorption systems , while another one is within 800 of other systems ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "interestingly , the 2 systems that do not have other absorption systems within 1000 , the @xmath56 system toward q1422 + 2309 and the @xmath57 system toward q2343 + 1232 , are both marginal in their detection .",
    "these results suggest a possible trend that low  clouds are more likely to show metal absorption when they are close to other metal systems .",
    "this possibility is explored later in section 3 .",
    "the 2 marginal systems that do not have other metal systems within 1000 could be false identifications .",
    "before we formed the composite spectrum , we visually inspected the spectral region of each quasar between the and emission lines and masked out any features ( absorption lines , apparent emission features due to cosmic rays , features due to poor subtraction of night sky lines or telluric absorption lines , etc ) that deviate significantly from the continuum .",
    "this essentially removed all features with significance above @xmath58 level ( as judged by eye ) .",
    "we will refer to these masked - out regions as `` bad '' regions or regions containing `` bad pixels '' , and refer to the resulting spectra as `` cleaned spectra '' .",
    "the bad regions are excluded from entering into the composite spectra .",
    "we then examined the region corresponding to each line in the sample in the cleaned spectra , and assign a flag to each system according to the `` cleanness '' of its region : `` 0 '' for systems whose @xmath31548.20 , 1550.77 regions are both clean , `` 1 '' for systems whose @xmath51550.77 region is clean but whose @xmath51548.20 region contains bad pixels , `` 2 '' for systems whose @xmath51548.20 region is clean but whose @xmath51550.77 region contains bad pixels , and `` 3 '' for systems that contain bad pixels in both the @xmath31548.20 , 1550.77 regions . in the above , `` @xmath51548.20 region '' refers to the spectral region within @xmath59 of the expected @xmath51548.20 line center ; likewise for @xmath51550.77 .",
    "we then formed composite spectra by shifting the spectrum of each system with certain chosen flag(s ) ( see section 3.3 ) to the rest frame of the line , rebinning the rest - frame spectrum onto a common velocity scale of bin size of 3.3 ( half the nominal resolution of the hires spectra ) , and averaging all the rest - frame spectra in the region weighted by the square of s / n at each bin .",
    "we also tried weighting each spectrum by the square of the mean s / n within @xmath59 of the @xmath51548 line , with negligible change in the results .    to estimate the equivalent width of the absorption in a composite spectrum",
    ", a continuum was first fitted to the composite spectrum using cubic splines after excluding the @xmath60 region centered on the @xmath51548.20 position .",
    "we then measured the equivalent width of @xmath51548.20 by directly integrating over the @xmath61 region centered on the position of @xmath51548.20 , where @xmath61 corresponds to 3 times the ( assumed ) fwhm of the absorption for @xmath62 based on profile fitting to absorption systems detected in other hires spectra ( cf .",
    "rauch et al 1996 ) .",
    "we had to assume a @xmath31 value for the absorption since no actual detection was made in any of the composite spectra ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "because no absorption was detected in the composite spectra , we estimated the equivalent width limit from monte carlo simulations .",
    "for each quasar spectrum , we first picked redshifts randomly within the redshift range over which the actual lines that were used to form a composite spectrum were found .",
    "the number of redshifts picked was the same as the observed number of lines .",
    "we then treated these random redshifts as positions of lines , assigned a flag to each redshift according to the `` cleanness '' of the region .",
    "we then formed a composite spectrum using these random redshifts and measured the equivalent width at the line position of @xmath51548.20 in exactly the same way as was done for the real data .",
    "this procedure was repeated 4000 times .",
    "the resulting distribution of measured equivalent width at the position of @xmath51548.20 was then examined to infer the 95.5% confidence limit on the equivalent width of @xmath51548.20 absorption in the composite spectrum , which corresponds to a 2@xmath49 upper limit if the distribution is gaussian .",
    "the actual distributions of the measurement equivalent widths from the simulations closely resemble a gaussian function .      the 95.5% confidence limit obtained above for each sample combined with",
    "the expected mean  of the sample ( column 5 of table 4 ) yields a /upper limit for the sample . in order to turn the n(c  iv)/n(h",
    "i ) limit into an estimate of the c abundance in the clouds , one must know the ionization conditions in the gas .",
    "since only  is known , it is not possible to constrain the ionization conditions from the ionic ratios .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations of cosmological structure formation in the context of the cold dark matter or other models have been generally successful in matching the observed characteristics of forest clouds over the redshift range @xmath29 ( cen et al 1994 ; petitjean , mucket , & kates 1995 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al 1995 ; miralda - escude et al 1996 ; rauch et al 1997 ) . in these models , the higher  clouds ( @xmath63 2 or so ) tend to be associated with filaments surrounding and connecting collapsed objects , while the lower  clouds tend to be found in voids .",
    "rauch et al ( 1997 ) addressed the ionization state of the clouds and heavy elements and showed that the observed n(c  iv)/n(h  i ) vs  follows the predicted relation from the simulations if a mean [ c / h]=@xmath64 is assumed for the gas .",
    "given the lack of observational constraints on the ionization conditions in the clouds in our sample and considering the reasonable success of the simulations , it seems appropriate to use their theoretical prediction of n(c  iv)/n(h  i ) vs  to estimate [ c / h ] for our clouds .",
    "an added benefit of using this relation is that the metallicity of the lower column density clouds considered here and that of the higher column density ( @xmath1 2 ) clouds considered by rauch et al are derived in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the n(c  iv)/n(h  i ) vs  relation of rauch et al ( 1997 ) over @xmath24@xmath10 2 can be described by the function @xmath65 for [ c / h]@xmath66 .",
    "this relation was used to infer [ c / h ] for the various composite spectra discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the conversion from /  to [ c / h ] was probably the most uncertain step in the entire analysis .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to estimate the magnitude of this uncertainty .",
    "however , because the same /vs  relation ( i.e. , equation ( 1 ) ) was used to derive metallicities for both the clouds ( this study ) and the @xmath1 2 clouds ( rauch et al ) , the relative metallicities between these clouds should be reasonably accurate .",
    "the results from analyzing the composite spectra for several samples ( next paragraph ) are tabulated in table 4 .",
    "column 1 of table 4 gives a letter identifying each sample .",
    "the second and third columns give the total number of lines in the sample and the mean redshift of the lines in the sample .",
    "column 4 indicates the estimated s / n per 6.6 resolution element in the composite spectrum based on propagation of the individual error spectra .",

    "following convention , we treat the clouds within 3,000 of the emission redshift of the background quasars separately from those further away from the emission redshift of the quasars for several reasons : ( 1 ) clouds very close to the quasar emission redshifts may be physically close to the background quasars and may be more highly ionized due to the enhanced uv ionizing flux .",

    "this upper limit is a factor of @xmath78 lower than for similar clouds that show absorption individually ( see `` associated '' systems in table 3 and section 4.2 ) . it is quite possible that these clouds occur within 3000 of the emission redshift of the background quasars solely by accident and that they are not related in anyway to the background quasars . in other words ,",

    "these results suggest that a rapid decrease with decreasing  in the mean metallicity level of the clouds sets in at @xmath82 2 .    in figure 4",
    "we show very crudely the metallicity distribution of quasar absorption line systems as a function of .",
    "the effects of non - solar relative abundances are ignored .",
    "a trend of decreasing metallicity with decreasing  is indicated by figure 4 .",
    "since the higher column density systems are likely to be more intimately associated with collapsed objects , where star formation is expected to occur earlier and more vigorously , the above trend of decreasing metallicity with decreasing  is consistent with the scenario in which star formation in collapsed objects eject metal - enriched material outwards and pollute their surroundings .",
    "the detection of absorption in individual clouds with  as low as @xmath15 2 in high sensitivity keck observations was considered evidence for the occurrence of an early generation of stars ( pop iii ) that may have polluted the entire universe in a wide spread fashion to a nearly uniform level of [ c / h]@xmath2 ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) .",
    "a similar inference was made by lu , sargent , & barlow ( 1997 ) based on the rough agreement between the metallicity , [ c / h]@xmath2 , that was inferred for the clouds and that of the lowest metallicity damped galaxies , generally believed to be the high - redshift progenitors of normal galaxies ( wolfe 1988 ) .",
    "however , the extremely low metallicities we infer for the clouds with rule out the scenario of uniform contamination by pop iii stars to [ c / h]@xmath83 .",
    "recent theoretical studies appear to corroborate this results .",
    "for example , ostriker & gnedin ( 1996 ) and gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ; see also murakami & yamashita 1997 ; steinmetz 1997 ) recently explored the process of early metal enrichment using high resolution numerical simulations . in the cobe - normalized cold dark matter plus cosmological constant model investigated by these authors ,",
    "the first generation of stars ( pop iii ) occurred at a redshift of @xmath84 through molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "subsequent supernova explosions from such stars then enriched the universe to a mean metallicity of @xmath85 solar , which is considerably lower than the mean [ c / h]@xmath2 found for  clouds with @xmath1 2 but is consistent with the upper limit found for clouds with .",
    "the energy release from the supernova also raised the temperature of the gas and destroyed the hydrogen molecules through photodissociation , thus temporarily shutting down the star formation process .",
    "it was not until @xmath86 when hydrogen line cooling became sufficient to induce a second major episode of star formation ( pop ii ) .",
    "interestingly , gnedin & ostriker predicted that there should be a sharp drop in the metallicity level of  clouds at column density below about @xmath87 2 at @xmath88 ( see their figure 7 ) , a feature apparently confirmed by our result .    in view of all the evidence , we conclude that , if a generation of pop iii stars occurred in the very early universe , the mean enrichment level of the intergalactic medium resulting from the associated supernova should be [ c / h]@xmath89 . the relatively high metallicities , [ c / h]@xmath2 , found for the @xmath1 2 clouds are best explained by later enrichment from pop ii stars occurring either within the clouds themselves or in nearby galaxies .",
    "it is possible to obtain some clues about the size scale of the metal - enriched ( i.e. , [ c / h]@xmath2 ) regions .",
    "if we assume that the observed velocity spread @xmath90 of the components in systems are purely due to ejection of metal - enriched gas from supernova , we can set a conservative upper limit on the maximum distance this enriched gas could have traveled by the time of observations .",
    "this distance is of the order of 200 kpc if a typical @xmath91 is adopted and if it is assumed that the first supernova occurred @xmath92 gyrs before our observation ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the lack of detectable metals in  clouds within 200 of known metal systems puts another limit on the spatial size of the enriched region to be @xmath93 kpcs if it is assumed that this velocity difference is purely due to hubble flow . finally , according to simulations , the @xmath94 2 contour , which roughly separates metal - rich gas with [ c / h]@xmath2 from metal - poor gas with [ c / h]@xmath7 , delineates a continuous filamentary gaseous structure in which galaxies are embedded .",
    "the thickness of this structure is of the order 100 kpcs ( rauch et al 1997 ) , in broad agreement with other estimates .",
    "as noted briefly in section 2.2 , some of the low column density clouds considered here show detectable absorption individually ( figure 2 and table 3 ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the vast majority of systems with similar  whose composite spectra did not reveal any absorption down to very sensitive limits ( table 4 ) .    to understand the nature of these low  clouds that apparently contain a significant amount of metals , we estimated the lower limit to their metallicity adopting the usual assumption that the clouds are photoionized by the integrated light from quasars .",
    "we ran several set of photoionization models using cloudy v90.02 ( ferland 1996 ) assuming plane - parallel geometry and uniform gas density for the clouds .",
    "we considered several plausible ionizing spectra : ( 1 ) the mean quasar spectrum constructed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ; hereafter hm ) assuming a transparent universe ; the spectrum has a spectral index @xmath95 over the critical 1 - 4 rydberg region ; ( 2 ) the above spectrum after taking into account the opacity of intervening clouds as calculated by hm ( their spectrum at redshift @xmath96 is adopted ) ; two further ionizing spectra considered were similar to the two mentioned above but with @xmath97 over 1 - 4 rydberg region .",
    "these latter spectra , which were also from hm ( private communication ) , were calculated in light of the work by zheng et al ( 1998 ) and laor et al ( 1997 ) after the hm paper had appeared in press .",
    "the cloudy results gave predictions about the variation of  as a function of the ionization parameter , @xmath98 ( the ratio of ionizing photon density to hydrogen gas particle density ) for chosen  and metallicity .",
    "for a given system with measured  and , we estimated a lower limit to [ c / h ] by assuming that the c  iv / h  i ratio is at the peak of the distribution .",
    "this approach resulted in the [ c / h ] lower limits given in column 7 ( [ c / h]@xmath99 ) of table 3 , where the cloudy results based on the @xmath97 hm spectrum without intervening opacity was used for the `` associated '' systems , and the cloudy results based on the @xmath97 hm spectrum taking into account the intervening opacity was used for the `` intervening '' systems . the ratio of c  iv / h",

    "the relative small differences suggest that the clouds in the rauch et al simulations are near the peak of c  iv / h  i distribution . ]",
    "it is possible that the clouds given in table 3 are collisionally ionized rather than photoionized .",
    "earlier studies ( blades 1988 , and references therein ; rauch et al 1996 ) found that the line widths of many  absorption lines are too narrow to be collisionally ionized .",
    "however , the conditions in the very low column density clouds considered here could be different . for gas that is in collisional ionization equilibrium , the ratio of c  iv / h  i peaks at temperature @xmath103 k with c  iv / h  i=@xmath104c / h ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) . for solar metallicity",
    ", this implies c  iv / h  i=7.2 . in comparison ,",
    "the peak c  iv / h  i value is around unity for the photoionization models considered above when solar metallicity is assumed .",
    "thus collisionally ionized clouds could reach much higher c  iv / h  i ratio than photoionized clouds for the same metallicity .",
    "the [ c / h ] limits derived from collisional ionization assuming the peak c  iv / h  i ratio are given in column 8 ( [ c / h]@xmath105 ) of table 3 .",
    "however , the widths of all but one of the absorption lines imply @xmath106 k , which is inconsistent with these clouds being collisionally ionized at @xmath107 k. it could be argued that the observed absorption is not responsible for the absorption . in this case ,",
    "the absorption corresponding to the collisionally - ionized absorption could be broad ( @xmath108 for @xmath109 k ) and shallow and may be hidden for some of the systems .",
    "however , 3 of the 7 intervening systems in table 3 have temperature @xmath110 k based on the width of the absorption lines .",
    "similarly , 2 of 8 of the associated systems in table 3 have @xmath110 k based on the width of the absorption .",
    "clearly the in these clouds can not be produced by collisional ionization at @xmath111 k under equilibrium conditions .",
    "it is perhaps no coincidence that almost all the absorption lines with inferred @xmath112 k are relatively strong and well measured , while those with inferred @xmath113 k are all relatively weak , suggesting that the temperature of the latter systems may have been overestimated owing to our inability to discern the component structure .",
    "we therefore conclude the these clouds are not likely to be collisionally ionized under equilibrium conditions .",
    "however , the clouds which show detectable  absorption could be collisionally ionized under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "indeed , hot plasma gas cools very fast over the @xmath111 k regime .",
    "as shown in figure 15 of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) , the cooling time for gas with solar composition at @xmath111 k is shorter than than the time to reach collisional ionization equilibrium for and especially for c  v. consequently , the overall ionization balance of c is governed by the slowly recombining c  v ion .",
    "figure 16 of sutherland & dopita indicates that large fractions of , c  v , and c  vi ions can exist at temperature as low as @xmath114 k under non - equilibrium conditions , while under collisional ionization equilibrium the fractions of these ions at such a low temperature would be negligible .",
    "these considerations raise the possibility that the ions in the clouds listed in table 3 with @xmath110 k could be produced by collisional ionization but under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "however , figure 16 of sutherland & dopita also indicates that n(c  ii)@xmath115  under such conditions .",
    "when the likely sub - solar metallicities of the clouds are taken into account , we infer from figures 9 , 14 , and 15 of sutherland & dopita that the actual cooling time scale in the clouds is likely to be shorter than the collisional ionization equilibrium time scale of c  ii and c  v but longer than that of .",
    "this should further _ increase _",
    "n(c  ii ) relative to n(c  iv ) because more should recombine to c  iii than can be created through the recombination of c  v. as a result , we expect to detect c  ii @xmath51334 absorption in these systems if the ions were produced by collisional ionization at @xmath110 k under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "no c  ii @xmath51334 absorption is found in any of the systems listed in table 3 in our hires spectra ( the c  ii @xmath51334 regions for three of the systems are contaminated by unrelated absorption lines ) .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the clouds showing detectable absorption are photoionized rather than collisionally ionized . assuming this is the case ,",
    "one then find that the intervening clouds have metallicities ranging from [ c / h]@xmath116 to [ c / h]@xmath117 ( see column 7 of table 3 ) , which is significantly higher than for typical clouds of similar .",
    "several of the associated systems have [ c / h ] within a factor of 2 of the solar metallicity .",
    "this result is consistent with previous work ( savaglio , dodorico , & moller 1994 ; petitjean , rauch , & carswell 1994 ; tripp , lu , & savage 1996 ) and it indicates rapid enrichment in the quasar nuclei / environment .",
    "the same characteristics appear to be shared by the broad absorption line clouds and broad emission line clouds ( cf .",
    "hamann 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "a few of the what we classify as `` associated '' systems ( because they are within 3,000 of @xmath52 ) actually have [ c / h ] lower limits comparable to most of the intervening systems ; some of these could be clouds that are unrelated to the quasar environment but happen to have redshifts close to @xmath52 .",
    "the inferred lower limits of [ c / h ] for the intervening clouds listed in table 3 are factors 20 - 400 ( or more ) higher than the mean [ c / h]@xmath7 found for the vast majority of intervening clouds ( table 4 ) .",
    "what are the causes of such large differences ?",
    "we consider two possibilities : ( 1 ) the intervening clouds which show individual absorption could represent the high metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution of the clouds ; ( 2 ) the intervening clouds with detectable absorption have a separate origin : perhaps they are ejected from the background quasar despite the large ejection velocities ( @xmath118 ) required , or they may be ejected from foreground quasars near the quasar sight line , in which case extremely large ejection velocity are no longer required .",
    "the latter possibility of case ( 2 ) above could be check by searching for foreground quasars near the redshifts of the systems that show detectable absorption .",
    "however , that the `` intervening '' systems listed in table 3 seem to have lower c  iv / h  i ratios on average than the `` associated '' systems suggests that they are probably not ejected from quasars .",
    "we now consider in some detail the more interesting case ( 1 ) above .",
    "if the weak lines in our sample have a broad distribution in metallicity and if the intervening clouds showing absorption indeed represent the high metallicity tail of that distribution , two conditions should be met .",
    "take sample a for example .",
    "first , the metallicity distribution in the clouds must be such that 6 toward q1422 + 2309 ) is within 50 of a strong line and does not qualify to be included in our sample .",
    "] of 282 + 6 randomly - drawn systems should have [ c / h]@xmath119 .",
    "second , the composite spectrum of the remaining 282 systems must not show @xmath51548 absorption with @xmath120 mor @xmath121 2 ( table 4 ) .    in order to examine the above conditions quantitatively , we explore the following simple model .",
    "we assume that the [ c / h ] distribution of the clouds can be described by a gaussian function with a mean metallicity @xmath122 and a standard dispersion @xmath123 .",
    "the first condition , that 6 of 288 randomly - drawn systems have [ c / h]@xmath119 then requires that [ c / h]@xmath124 is 2.04@xmath123 away from @xmath125 . in other words : @xmath126 for the second condition , it can be shown that , for a ensemble of clouds drawn randomly from the h i column density distribution @xmath46 and the above metallicity distribution , the mean column density of is @xmath127}-12.30}/n_l ,   \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the total number of lines in the sample . here ,",
    "equation ( 1 ) has been used to derive  for individual cloud from the  and [ c / h ] values drawn from the distributions .",
    "the sum in equation ( 3 ) can be estimated numerically .",
    "strictly speaking , one should take into account the variable detection sensitivity ( i.e. , variable s / n ) of the spectra in the above analysis .",
    "however , given the crudeness of this analysis , and considering the relative uniformity of the hires spectra , assuming a uniform detection sensitivity for this analysis probably suffice for our purposes .",
    "equation ( 2 ) maps out a straight line in the @xmath125 vs @xmath123 plane , while equation ( 3 ) combined with the requirement @xmath129 2 maps out a region in the @xmath125 vs @xmath123 plane .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 , where the solid straight line is equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the shaded area indicates the [ @xmath125 , @xmath123 ] combinations for which the composite spectrum of 282 randomly drawn systems , subject to the condition [ c / h]@xmath131 , would not reveal a @xmath51548.20 absorption with mean @xmath121 2 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the solid line connecting the dots gives the [ @xmath125 , @xmath123 ] relation for which the composite spectrum of 282 randomly drawn systems ( again , subject to the condition [ c / h]@xmath131 ) would produce a @xmath51548.20 absorption with a mean @xmath132 2 .",
    "it is seen that only at @xmath133 or so is there any overlap between the straight line and the shaded area , when the two conditions mentioned above are met simultaneously .",
    "thus , within the validity of the simple model explored here , if the 7 intervening systems with that individually show absorption are drawn from the same population as the remaining systems with similar  which do not show detectable absorption , then the overall metallicity distribution of the clouds must be such that it has a mean metallicity [ c / h]@xmath134 with a dispersion @xmath135 dex .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the mean metallicity of @xmath85 predicted by ostriker & gnedin ( 1996 ) for the enrichment by pop iii stars .",
    "we have investigated the metal contents of clouds at @xmath0 with  using high resolution ( fwhm=6.6 ) , high s / n ( @xmath73100:1 ) spectra obtained with the 10 m keck i telescope .",
    "previous investigations of similar nature were limited to clouds with @xmath1 2 for which a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath2 was deduced .",
    "it has been suggested that the metals seen in these clouds may have been produced by a generation of population iii stars occurred at a much earlier epoch before the formation of quasars and normal galaxies . from 9 of our best s /",
    "n quasar spectra obtained with the hires , we selected @xmath73300 lines with estimated  between .",
    "the lines selected have absorption redshift @xmath136 ( excluding lines within 3000 of the quasar emission redshifts ) . after eliminating a small number of lines that individually show detectable absorption ( see point 4 below ) , we shifted the quasar spectra into the rest frame of each of the remaining clouds in the sample and then averaged the rest - frame spectra over the spectral region encompassing the @xmath31548.20 , 1550.77 absorption lines .",
    "we reached s / n as high as 1860:1 per 6.6 resolution element in our composite spectra .",
    "such a high s / n would have been impossible to obtain through direct observations .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows :    \\(1 ) no significant absorption was detected in any of the composite spectra we investigated .",
    "the most sensitive limit was obtained when all lines in the sample ( excluding those showing absorption individually ) that are more than 3,000 away from the background quasars were included in the analysis , for which we reached a s / n=1860:1 per resolution element , corresponding to an upper limit of @xmath6 m  ( 95.5% confidence limit ) for the rest - frame equivalent width of the @xmath51548.20 line .",
    "we deduced a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath7 for these clouds using the cosmological simulations of rauch et al ( 1997 ) to infer the ionization correction ; the same simulation results have been used previously to deduce a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath2 for clouds with @xmath1 2 .",
    "the low metallicities derived for the clouds appear to hold to within a factor of @xmath75 independent of redshift or  over the range considered above .",
    "in particular , a sample of clouds occurring within 200 of known metal systems yielded a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath76 ( 95.5% confidence limit ) based on a composite spectrum analysis .",

    "this result rules out the suggestion that a generation of pop iii stars could have polluted the entire universe to a uniform level of [ c / h]@xmath2 .",
    "cosmological simulations involving gas hydrodynamics indicate that absorption with @xmath1 2 mostly occurs in continuous filaments of gas surrounding and connecting collapsed objects , while those with @xmath10 2 are preferentially found in void regions further away from collapsed objects .",
    "these results , coupled with theoretical predictions about pop iii star formation and enrichment ( ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , strongly suggest that most of the heavy elements in clouds with @xmath1 2 were probably produced _ in situ _ by pop ii stars , in the sense that they were either made by stars within the clouds or were ejected from nearby star - forming galaxies .",
