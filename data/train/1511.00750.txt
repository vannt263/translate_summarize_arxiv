    "the effects of social influence on consumer behaviour have been observed in a wide range of settings ( e.g. , @xcite ) . social influence may appear through different social signals , such as the number of past purchases , consumer ratings , and consumer recommendations , depending on the market and/or the marketing platform . however , not all social signals are equally important .",
    "indeed , two recent studies @xcite have been conducted to understand the relative importance of different social signals on consumer behaviour , one in the android app platform and the other one in hotel selection . both experiments arrived to the same conclusion , namely that the popularity signal ( i.e. , the number of purchases ) has a much stronger impact on consumer behavior than the average consumer rating signal .",
    "in addition to the impact of social influence , consumer preferences are also affected in significant ways by product visibilities . in digital markets ,",
    "the impact of visibility on consumer behavior has been widely observed , including in internet advertisement where sophisticated mathematical models have been developed to determine the relative importance of the various product positions @xcite .",
    "positioning effects are also of high significance in online stores such as expedia , amazon , and itunes , as well as physical retail stores ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    there are at least three key managerial decisions that naturally arise in markets with social influence and visibility :    1 .   how to assign products to the available positions ? 2",
    "how should social influence be used ?",
    "is it beneficial at all ? 3 .",
    "what are the benefits of market segmentation ?",
    "all these decisions may have a fundamental impact on market efficiency and predictability .",
    "the first type of decisions ponders how to rank the products and studies whether popularity or a concept of quality should drive the assignment of products to positions .",
    "the second type of decisions analyzes which social influence signal ( e.g. , popularity signals versus ratings ) is beneficial ( if any ) .",
    "finally , the third type of decisions analyzes the benefits of presenting different information to different customers .",
    "this is particularly significant in online markets where rich information may have been gathered on an arriving customer and its relationship with others .",
    "for example , a recent analysis performed by the online travel agent orbitz has shown that mac users spend up to about 30% more in hotel bookings than their pc counterparts @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "it is beneficial to show different rankings to customers depending on the computer they use .",
    "of course , these decisions do not take place in isolation .",
    "for instance , it is valuable to study how to combine social influence and market segmentation in order to determine which signal ( if any ) should be used for different segmentation strategies . while most online platforms display social signals about",
    "_ all _ past consumers , the major online travel agent _",
    "booking.com _ allows users to rank hotels according to the average consumers score of a particular segment such as couples , families , and solo travelers .",
    "see figure [ fig : awesome_image ] for an illustration of this feature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address these questions by studying the dynamics of a marketplace ran by a single firm and where the choice preferences of its heterogeneous consumers are modeled using a mixed multinomial logit . in this marketplace ,",
    "consumers are influenced by the past purchases , as well as by the inherent appeal of the products and how visible each product is in the marketplace .",
    "our approach applies to multiple settings such as those arising in music and film online markets and trial - offer and freemium markets .",
    "it also generalizes recent models already verified in cultural markets .",
    "our work is related to the musiclab experiment performed by @xcite . in that experiment , participants were presented a list of unknown songs from unknown bands , each song being described by its name and band .",
    "the participants were partitioned into two groups exposed to two different experimental conditions : the _ independent _ condition and the _ social influence _ condition . in the independent group , participants were shown the songs in a random order and they were allowed to listen to each of them and then download them if they wish . in the second group ( social influence condition ) , participants were shown the songs in popularity order , i.e. , allocating the most popular songs to the most visible positions . moreover , these participants were also shown a social signal , i.e. , the number of times each song was downloaded too .",
    "in order to investigate the impact of social influence , participants in the second group were distributed in eight `` worlds '' evolving completely independently .",
    "in particular , participants in one world had no visibility about the downloads and the rankings in the other worlds .",
    "the musiclab is an ideal experimental example of a trial - offer market where each song represents a product , and listening and downloading a song represent trying and purchasing a product respectively .",
    "the results by @xcite show that the different worlds evolve significantly differently from one another , providing evidence that social influence may introduce unpredictability in a market .",
    "to explain these results , @xcite proposed a framework in which consumer choices are captured by a multinomial logit model whose product utilities depend on songs appeal , position bias , and social influence .",
    "@xcite provided a theoretical and experimental analysis of such trial - offer markets using different ranking policies following the framework of @xcite .",
    "they proved that social influence is beneficial in order to maximize the expected number of downloads when using a greedy heuristic known as _ performance ranking_. in _ performance ranking _ selects greedily the ranking that maximizes the expected number of downloads at the next time period , i.e. it maximizes the short - term market efficiency .",
    "@xcite have also illustrated experimentally that the popularity ranking is outperformed by the performance ranking in a variety of settings .",
    "still based on the model of @xcite , @xcite have studied the performance of the _ quality ranking _ which ranks products by their intrinsic quality : they show that the quality ranking is in fact asymptotically optimal and has a considerably less unpredictability than the popularity ranking .",
    "the main shortcoming of the models employed in @xcite is the assumption that consumers are homogeneous : the product qualities and appeals are the same for all consumers .",
    "given that current technology makes it possible for a website to obtain user information ( including computer type ) , online firms may use this information to prioritize differently the product assortments for each incoming customer . moreover , these firms may also decide to incorporate information about the past purchases of a specific consumer class as a social signal .",
    "for example , instead of displaying the total number of bookings for each hotel , the firm may only display the number of bookings by similar consumers ( e.g. , in age or income bracket ) .",
    "pursuing such segmentation strategies has an associated cost as it requires to gather consumer information and to analyze it correctly .",
    "it is thus important to understand their potential benefits and to go beyond the models in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we remedy this limitation and study the dynamics of trial - offer markets with social influence and where consumers have heterogeneous preferences .",
    "more specifically , consumer preferences are modeled with a mixed multinomial logit @xcite .",
    "our main findings provide quantitative insights about the benefits of market segmentation in online markets and can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we first show that computing the ( optimal ) performance ranking in a mixed multinomial logit model is np - hard under turing reductions , indicating that moving from an homogeneous setting ( mnl ) to an heterogeneous setting ( mixed mnl ) has significant computational implications .",
    "we then study a policy , the average quality ranking , which orders the items in decreasing order of average quality .",
    "we show that the average quality ranking converges to a unique equilibrium when consumers are shown the number of past purchases ( the popularity signal ) .",
    "unfortunately , we also show that the popularity signal may , perhaps surprisingly , decrease the expected market efficiency of the average quality ranking .",
    "we consider a simple segmentation strategy , where customers are shown a quality ranking dedicated to their class and only observe the popularity signal for their own market segment ( i.e. , the past purchases of customers of the same class .",
    "we show that this segmented quality ranking always outperforms , asymptotically and in expectation , the average quality ranking and may improve the market efficiency by a factor @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the number of classes .",
    "these theoretical results are complemented by an agent - based simulation performed on a number of settings .",
    "the simulation results highlight every theoretical results , suggesting that the segmented quality ranking with a popularity signal is an interesting avenue for trial - offer markets .    the remaining of this paper",
    "is organized as follows .",
    "section [ the_model_section ] introduces the model of the dynamic trial - offer market .",
    "the most relevant ranking policies for this model are described in section [ ranking_policies_section ] , which also presents the np - hardness results for performance ranking in mixed multinomial logit models .",
    "section [ section : quality ] describes the convergence and the impact of social influence for the quality ranking in the same setting .",
    "section [ market_segmentation_section ] presents our segmentation strategy and its benefits .",
    "section [ section : simulations ] presents the results of the agent - based simulation and section [ section : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the proofs not given in the text are in the appendix .",
    "[ [ motivation ] ] motivation + + + + + + + + + +    we consider a firm running a marketplace that sells a set of products .",
    "following @xcite , we focus our attention to trial - offer markets , i.e. , markets in which consumers can try the product for free before deciding to make a purchase .",
    "consumers are position - biased in the following sense : the likelihood of trying a specific product is affected by the position of the product , as well as the position of the others products in the market .",
    "there is large experimental evidence for this type of bias in digital markets @xcite , as well as in traditional retailing @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important for the firm to decide how to allocate products to locations since this affects the market efficiency , i.e. , the total number of purchases .",
    "we also consider a marketplace where it is possible to display information about product popularity .",
    "in particular , we assume that the firm shows the total number of purchases for each item at each point in time . while there is considerable evidence and consensus among the researchers that the display of information about consumer preferences changes consumer behaviour , it remains a matter of discussion whether such display may benefit consumers and the market ,    unlike @xcite , we consider that there are different classes of consumers , meaning that the probability that a consumer would try a given item depends on the consumer class .",
    "our model for consumer behaviour is therefore far more general than in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the probability that a given consumer tries an item will follow a mixed multinomial logit ( mmnl ) . since @xcite proved that every random utility model can be well approximated by a mmnl , our model of consumer preferences is indeed very general .",
    "[ [ formalization ] ] formalization + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now formally describe a dynamic model for this marketplace . let @xmath1=\\{1,2,\\hdots , n\\}$ ] denote the set of items in the marketplace and @xmath2 denote the set of the permutations of these items . at any point in time , the firm decides how to position the items in the market by selecting a permutation @xmath3 such that @xmath4 implies that item @xmath5 is placed in position @xmath6 ( @xmath7 $ ] ) .    the consumer behaviour can be described as follows .",
    "there are @xmath0 different classes of consumers .",
    "the rate of consumers from class @xmath8 arriving in any given time interval of unitary length follows a poisson process with a mean value @xmath9 .",
    "the _ weight _",
    "@xmath10 of each class @xmath5 is then defined as @xmath11 when consumer @xmath12 enters the market , she observes all the items and a popularity vector @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of times item @xmath5 has been bought for prior to her arrival at time @xmath12 .",
    "when the consumer arrives , each of the @xmath15 items have been given a position through a permutation @xmath16 .",
    "the consumer selects an item to try and then decides whether to buy it . if the consumer belongs to class @xmath8 , the probability that she tries item @xmath5 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is fixed to a constant for the duration of the process , @xmath19 represents the visibility of position @xmath7 $ ] regardless of the consumer class ( the higher the value @xmath20 the more visible the item in that position is ) , and @xmath21 captures the intrinsic appeal of item @xmath5 for consumer class @xmath8 for all @xmath22 $ ] ( higher values correspond to more appealing items ) .    if a consumer from class @xmath8 has selected item @xmath5 for a trial , the probability that she would purchase the item is given by @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "observe that this probability is independent of both the appeal vector @xmath24 and the visibility vector @xmath25 .",
    "intuitively , this assumption , which has been validated in the musiclab experiment , captures the fact that it is more difficult to influence consumers after they have tested a product than before .",
    "when the consumer decides to purchase item @xmath5 , the popularity / sales vector @xmath26 is increased by one in position @xmath5 . to analyze this process , we divide time into discrete periods such that each new period begins when a new consumer arrives .",
    "hence , the length of each time period is not constant .",
    "the objective of the firm running this market is to maximize the total expected number of purchases . to achieve this , the key managerial decision of the firm is what is known as the ranking policy @xcite , which consists in deciding at each point in time the permutation @xmath3 to display the items .",
    "the next section describes a number of relevant ranking policies for this model .",
    "a key aspect of this paper is to study the potential benefits of the popularity signal on market efficiency and compare the ranking policies with and without this signal . in this paper",
    ", we always assume that the popularity signal is used as specified in equation .",
    "when the popularity signal is not used , the probability of sampling a product is given by assuming that the popularity signal is simply the vector @xmath27 .",
    "consider without loss of generality that the @xmath15 locations are sorted by their visibility such that @xmath28 .",
    "a ranking policy is a function @xmath29 which , given a vector of past purchases , returns a ranking of the items .",
    "ranking policies can be partitioned into two groups : _",
    "static _ and _ dynamic_. a ranking policy @xmath30 is said to be _",
    "static _ if the output ranking does not depend on the popularity signal , i.e. , if @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamic _ ranking policy is one in which the output ranking depends on this signal .",
    "a widely used dynamic policy consists in ranking the items according to their current popularity : select @xmath3 such that @xmath33 if item @xmath34 is currently the @xmath35 most purchased product at this point .",
    "this policy is called the _ popularity ranking _ and is widely used . @xcite",
    "have shown that this ranking policy does not maximize the expected number of purchases in the special case where @xmath36 .",
    "another dynamic ranking strategy , known as _ activity ranking _ , was studied in an experiment by @xcite . in activity",
    "ranking , products are sorted in chronological order of the last purchased time , i.e. , the item last purchased appears first , while the item least recently purchased appears last . in their experiment conducted with individuals recruited with the mechanical turk ,",
    "@xcite have observed that activity ranking improves consumer recommendations with respect to popularity ranking .",
    "the _ performance ranking _ is a dynamic policy that greedily selects a ranking that maximizes the expected number of purchases in the following period .",
    "this strategy was first proposed by @xcite for the special case with @xmath36 and we now generalize its definition for the more general model considered in this paper .",
    "given the memory - less nature of the poisson distribution , the probability that the next incoming consumer belongs to class @xmath8 is given by @xmath37 therefore the performance ranking at time period @xmath12 consists of finding the permutation @xmath38 maximizing the probability of a purchase in the next time period , i.e. , @xmath39 the probability @xmath40 of a purchase in the next time period is thus given by @xmath41    @xcite showed that the performance ranking can be computed efficiently , i.e. , in strongly polynomial time : see theorem 1 by @xcite .",
    "but their proof can be easily generalized for any @xmath42 .",
    "] moreover , despite the myopic focus of the performance ranking , a series of agent - based simulations performed by @xcite showed that , for the special case of @xmath36 , the performance ranking outperforms the popularity ranking by roughly 20 percent in the long run on experiments modeled after the musiclab , and exhibits much less unpredictability .",
    "unfortunately , the performance ranking can not be computed efficiently when there are at least two classes of consumers .",
    "more precisely , we can show that the 2-class logit problem which is known to be np - hard @xcite can be reduced ( under turing reductions ) to computing the performance ranking in our setting .",
    "[ theorem_hardness ] computing the performance ranking is np - hard under turing reductions .",
    "this is true even when @xmath43 and the product qualities are the same for all consumer classes .",
    "the proof uses the 2-class logit problem which is known to be np - hard @xcite .",

    "given an instance of the 2-class logit problem , the idea is to create @xmath15 different instances of the performance - ranking problem in order to capture the various possible assortments .",

    "hence , the performance ranking is np - hard under turing reductions .",
    "finally , the _ quality ranking _ is a simple and natural static policy studied by @xcite for the case @xmath36 : it simply consists in ranking the products by quality , ignoring the appeals and popularity signal .",
    "the quality ranking can easily be generalized to @xmath0 classes by taking the weighted average of the class qualities .",

    "the next section will study whether this continues to hold @xmath79 .",
    "note that , in the following , the ranking which orders the products by decreasing values of @xmath80 is called the _ average quality ranking_.",
    "this section studies the properties of the average quality ranking for the mmnl model .",
    "we first show that the average quality ranking converges to a monopoly ( under weak conditions ) .",
    "we then study the benefits of popularity signal for the average quality ranking .",
    "given a ranking policy @xmath81 , the random variable @xmath82 is known as the market share of item @xmath5 at time @xmath12 : it represents the ratio between the number of times that item @xmath5 was purchased and the total number of purchases at time @xmath12 .",

    "the direct consequence of these results is the lack of clarity about the benefits of the popularity signal in mmnl models . the popularity signal may be beneficial to the average quality ranking but it may also significantly degrade the performance of the market",
    "this is in contrast with the mnl model where the quality ranking always benefits from the popularity signal ( in expectation ) . as a result ,",

    "the market segmentation considered here assumes that the firm has the ability to know the class of each arriving consumer .",
    "this is a natural assumption in a number of online markets ( e.g. , amazon , online retail stores , itunes , and netflix ) where firms are able to learn information about their customers over time .",
    "armed with this information , the firm will now propose item rankings dedicated to each customer class . moreover , and equally important , the popularity signal will be tailored to each class . in other words , _ the firm will only show the popularity signal derived from purchases of customers of the same class as the incoming customer _",
    ", not the popularity obtained from the entire customer pool . as shown in figure [ fig : awesome_image ] , websites such as booking.com already give customers the option of selecting their peer groups to refine the site recommendations .",

    "we now study the benefits of this market segmentation .",
    "observe first that each market segment can be viewed as evolving independently and hence directly inherits the original benefits identified by @xcite for the quality ranking : it is asymptotically optimal and predictably goes to a monopoly .",

    "they differ in how the values for the item appeals and qualities are chosen .",
    "the schemes are depicted visually in figures [ fig : setting12 ] and [ fig : setting34 ] and were obtained as follows :    1 .",
    "scheme 1 : the product qualities for each class were chosen uniformly at random 1(@xmath188 and @xmath189 are independent ) .",

    "2 .   scheme 2 : product qualities are similar to scheme 1 .",

    "[ [ the - policies ] ] the policies + + + + + + + + + + + +    the simulations compare the average and segmented quality rankings with and without the popularity signal .",
    "we use the following notations :    * sqssi : segmented quality ranking with segmented popularity signal ; * sqnsi : segmented quality ranking without popularity signal ; * aqgsi : average quality ranking with `` global '' popularity signal ; * aqnsi : average quality ranking without popularity signal .",
    "figure [ fig : me12 ] depicts the results for schemes 1 and 2 . for scheme 1 , the popularity signal is beneficial for both the segmented and average quality rankings .",
    "sqssi is the most efficient ranking policy .",
    "interestingly , without the popularity signal , the segmentation policy ( i.e. , the sqnsi policy ) performs the worst .",
    "scheme 2 exhibits similar results but the benefits of popularity signal is extremely significant .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that aqgsi outperforms sqssi early on before being overtaken as highlighted in figure [ fig : me12inset ] .",
    "figure [ fig : me34 ] depicts the results for schemes 3 and 4 and they are particularly interesting .",
    "recall that , in schemes 3 and 4 , the two classes of customers associate opposite qualities to items . for scheme 3 , sqssi is again the best ranking policy but the second best policy is aqnsi , the average quality ranking with no popularity signal .",
    "the worst policy is aqgsi , providing a compelling illustration of theorem [ bound - nsi ] : the popularity signal may be detrimental to the average quality ranking . for scheme 4 ,",
    "the popularity signal is again beneficial for the segmented and average quality rankings .",
    "sqssi is almost twice as efficient than aqgsi , nicely illustrating theorem [ benefits_clustering ] , since the improvement is close to the best possible ratio .",
    "once again , sqnsi performs the worst .",
    "these results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "sqssi ( segmentation with the popularity signal ) is clearly the best policy and it dominates all other policies .",
    "market segmentation with the popularity signal is very effective in these trial - offer markets .",
    "sqnsi ( segmentation with no popularity signal ) is almost always the worst policy and is dominated by aqnsi ( average quality with no popularity signal ) . in these trial - offer settings ,",
    "segmentation with no popularity signal is not an effective policy .",
    "3 .   the popularity signal may be beneficial or detrimental to the average quality ranking .",
    "it is detrimental when the market has customers are from two classes with opposite tastes .",
    "we now illustrate the customer and market behaviors for the sqssi and aggsi rankings , which exhibit some significant differences . for scheme 3 ,",
    "the results are presented in figures [ fig : sqssi3 - 12unpred ] , [ fig : aqgsi3 - 12unpred ] , and [ fig : unpred3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sqssi3 - 12unpred ] depicts the purchase profiles of customers of classes 1 and 2 for policy sqssi .",

    "class 2 ) is in the rightmost position in the left ( resp .",
    "right ) picture .",
    "since the market is segmented , the results are not surprising and consistent with past results : the number of purchases is strongly correlated with quality .",
    "figure [ fig : aqgsi3 - 12unpred ] is more interesting and depicts the same information for policy aqgsi . here",
    "the number of purchases is no longer correlated with quality for a specific customer class .",
    "figure [ fig : unpred3 ] compares sqssi and aqgsi over all customers and the products are sorted by average quality .",
    "the figure highlights a fundamental difference in market behavior between the two policies , with very different products emerging as the `` best sellers '' .",
    "schemes 3 and 4 feature customer classes with opposite tastes .",
    "it is thus interesting to report the results on scheme 1 where the tastes ( qualities ) were generated independently for the two classes .",
    "figure [ fig : unpred1 ] depicts these results .",
    "we already know from figure [ fig : me12 ] that policy sqssi outperforms aqgsi but it is interesting to see how different the market behaves under these two policies . for aqgsi ,",
    "as expected , the products of best average quality receives the most purchases : asymptotically the market goes to a monopoly for that product . for sqssi ,",
    "the purchases at this stage of the market are distributed through a larger number of products , each of which have fewer purchases .",
    "asymptotically , the market will go to a monopoly for two products ( one for class 1 and one for class 2 ) but the popularity signal is weaker for sqssi since it is spread across the two classes .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the segmentation policy sqssi is still more efficient than policy aggsi despite this weaker popularity signal .",
    "figure [ fig : sqssi1 - 12unpred ] depicts the profiles for policy sqssi and nicely highlights that many products are receiving significant purchases .",
    "this paper considered a trial - offer market with social influence and position bias , where customers follow a mixed multinomial logit model ( mmnl ) .",
    "it proved that , for such a market , finding the best ranking at every step is a computationally hard problem .",
    "the paper then studied the performance of a ranking policy ( aqgsi ) based on average product qualities .",
    "the paper proved that the trial - offer market converges predictably to a monopoly by transforming the mmnl model into a traditional mnl model whose appeals and qualities depends on the popularity signal at each time step but are bounded from below and above .",
    "unfortunately , this average quality ranking1 is no longer guaranteed to benefit from the popularity signal in all cases .    the paper also studied a market segmentation policy which produces a different quality ranking for each class of customers and uses a popularity signal aggregating only customers in the specific segment .",
    "the resulting policy ( sqssi ) is optimal asymptotically in expectation and may improve the market efficiency by a factor @xmath0 over aqgsi , where @xmath0 is the number of customer classes .",
    "agent - based simulation results have been presented to illustrate the theoretical results .",
    "they present settings in which the popularity signal is indeed detrimental to policy aqgsi and in which sqssi improves aqgsi by a factor of about 2 with two classes .",
    "they also highlight that sqssi outperforms all other policies in these settings , complementing the fact that it is asymptotically optimal .",
    "moreover , they highlight the fact that aqgsi and sqssi produce very different market behavior , even in settings where the overall market efficiency is relatively close .    these results seem to indicate that a market segmentation policy , together with a popularity signal and position bias , is an interesting avenue to make markets more efficient , both for the market place and the customers .",
