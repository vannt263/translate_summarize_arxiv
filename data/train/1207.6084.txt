    "the recent works @xcite study the problem of _ optimal actuation for source and channel coding _ for resource - constrained systems . specifically , in @xcite , an extension of the wyner - ziv source coding problem is considered in which the decoder or the encoder can take actions that affect the quality of the side information available at the decoder s side .",
    "when the actions are taken by the decoder , the latter operates in two stages . in the first stage , based on the message received from the encoder , the decoder selects cost - constrained actions @xmath0 that affect the measurement of the side information @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is modelled by a channel @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the source available at the encoder . in the second stage",
    ", the decoder produces an estimate of source @xmath3 based on the side information @xmath1 as in the standard wyner - ziv problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar formulation also applies when the actions are taken at the encoder s side .",
    "this model can account , as an example , for computer networks in which the acquisition of side information from remote data bases is costly in terms of system resources and thus should be done efficiently .",
    "we refer to this class of problems as having _",
    "actions for _ _ side information acquisition_.    in @xcite , a related channel coding problem is studied in which the encoder in a point - to - point channel can take actions to affect the state of a channel .",
    "the encoder operates in two stages . in the first stage , based on the message to be conveyed to the decoder , cost - constrained actions @xmath0",
    "are selected by the encoder that affect the channel state @xmath4 of the channel @xmath5 used for communication to the decoder in the second stage . in the second stage ,",
    "the channel @xmath5 is used in a standard way based on the available information about the state @xmath4 ( which can be non - causal or causal , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to this problem as having _",
    "actions for channel state control_. as shown in @xcite , this model can be used to account for an encoder that in the first stage _",
    "probes _ the channel to acquire state information .      as discussed above , _",
    "optimal actuation for channel and source coding _ , as proposed in _ _",
    "@xcite , prescribes the selection of the actions @xmath0 towards the goal of improving the performance of the resource - constrained communication link between encoder and decoder .",
    "this can be done by acquiring side information in an efficient way for source coding problems , and by controlling or probing effectively the channel state for channel coding problems .",
    "this work starts from the observations that the actions @xmath0 often entail the use of physical resources for communication within the system encompassing the link under study .",
    "for instance , acquiring information from a data base requires the receiver to exchange control signals with a server , and probing the congestion state of a network ( modelled as a channel ) requires transmission of training packets to the closest router . in all these cases ,",
    "the `` recipient '' of the actions , e.g. , the server or a router in the examples above , may request to obtain partial information about the source or message being communicated on the link . to illustrate this point",
    ", the server in the data base application might need to acquire some explicit information about the file being transmitted in the link before granting access to the server .",
    "similarly , the router might need to obtain the header of the packet ( message ) that the transmitter intends to deliver to the end receiver .    in the scenarios discussed above , the action @xmath0 thus serves a double purpose : on the one hand , it should be designed to improve the performance of the communication link at hand as in @xcite , and , on the other , it should provide explicit information about source or message for a separate decoder ( the server or router in the examples above ) .",
    "a relevant question thus is : _ how much information can be embedded in the actions @xmath0 without affecting the performance of the link _ ? or , to turn the question around , _",
    "what is the performance loss for the link as a function of the amount of information that is encoded in the actions _ @xmath0 ?",
    "this work aims at answering these questions for both the source and channel coding scenarios discussed above ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] for the corresponding models with strictly causal and causal observation of the actions at decoder 2 , respectively . ]",
    "the interplay between communication and actuation , or control , is recognized to arise at different levels . as mentioned , the main theme in the papers @xcite is `` _ _ control for communication _ _ '' : in @xcite , actuation is instrumental in improving the performance of a resource - constrained communication system",
    ". extensions of this research direction include models with additional design constraints @xcite , with adaptive actions @xcite , with memory @xcite and with multiple terminals @xcite@xcite .",
    "somewhat related , but distinct , is the line of work including @xcite-@xcite , in which control - theoretic tools are leveraged to design effective communication schemes .",
    "an altogether different theme is instead central in work such as @xcite that can be referred to as `` _ _ communication for control _ _ '' .",
    "in fact , in a reversed way , in @xcite ( and references therein ) , communication is instrumental in carrying out control tasks such as stabilization of a plant .",
    "for instance , @xcite shows that an implicit message communicated between two controllers can greatly improve the performance of the control task .",
    "the idea of embedding information in the actions is related to the classical problem of information hiding ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in information hiding , a message is embedded in a host data under distortion constraints .",
    "the message is then retrieved by a decoder that observes the host signal through a noisy channel .",
    "note that the ( host ) signal onto which the message is embedded is a given process .",
    "instead , in the set - up of information embedding on actions considered here , the ( action ) signal on which information is embedded is designed to optimize the given communication task .",
    "the set - up at hand is also related to the source coding model of @xcite , in which an encoder communicates to two decoders and one of the decoders is able to observe the source estimate produced by the other . for its duality with the classical channel coding model studied in @xcite , the operation of the first decoder",
    "was referred to in @xcite as _ cribbing_. although the problem of interest here ( in the source coding part ) is significantly different , in that the recipient of the embedded information is a decoder `` cribbing '' the actions and not the estimates of another decoder , the solutions of the two problems turn out to be related , as it will be discussed .",

    "note that the joint distribution of the random variables @xmath384 established above factorizes as @xmath385 but can be restricted only to pmfs factorizing as in ( [ eq : joint_enc ] ) .",

    "assuming now that this rate region is achievable , we show that the rate region ( [ eqn : channel_region ] ) is also achievable .",
    "region ( [ eqn : channel_region ] ) is larger than ( [ eqn : channel_region_equiv ] ) owing to the absence of the inequality ( [ eq : r1+r2_equiv2 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : equivalence ] for a given choice of the distribution      ( [ eq : joint_channel ] ) , with region ( [ eqn : channel_region_equiv ] ) in solid lines and ( [ eqn : channel_region ] ) in dashed lines .",
    "we now argue that the achievability of region ( [ eqn : channel_region_equiv ] ) ( solid lines ) implies the achievability of region ( [ eqn : channel_region ] ) ( dashed lines ) as well , by following the same arguments as in @xcite . specifically , we observe that , if @xmath269 is achievable with some scheme , then @xmath395 is also achievable for all @xmath396 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , if the rate pair @xmath269 is achievable , then some of the rate of the common message @xmath247 can always be transferred to the private message @xmath397 for decoder 2 to achieve @xmath395 if @xmath396 .",
    "it follows immediately that all the points on the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : equivalence ] are also achievable .",
    "the discussion above allows us to conclude that concludes that , if region ( [ eqn : channel_region_equiv ] ) is achievable , then the desired rate region ( [ eqn : channel_region ] ) is also achievable .",
