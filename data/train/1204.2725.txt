    "there has been great progress in our understanding of inanimate matter .",
    "how is living matter different from inanimate matter ?",
    "our focus is on taking a fresh look at the hints provided by nature and develop a framework for understanding proteins @xcite , which are the engines of life .",
    "we suggest that ( 1 ) protein - like structures lie in a marginally compact `` phase '' of matter in the proximity of a transition to the swollen phase ; ( 2 ) the limited menu of protein folds @xcite arises independent of sequence specificity thereby relegating the role of sequence to picking from this menu the best - fit fold for its native state - the specific amino acids in the vicinity of the active site also play a key role in functionality ; ( 3 ) sequence design is relatively straightforward starting from random peptides , whose low energy conformations have snippets of secondary motifs ; ( 4 ) the native fold of a well designed sequence is robust to mutations as is observed in experiments @xcite ; and ( 5 ) protein structure is more fundamental than sequence even though they both play a pivotal role in determining protein behavior .    proteins @xcite are short linear heteropolymers made up of amino acids .",
    "current theory notes that the interactions of the side - chains of the amino acids with one another and with the water can be frustrating @xcite , as in spin glasses , resulting in a rugged free energy landscape riddled with many local minima .",
    "a rugged landscape is not conducive to rapid folding , because the chain can easily get stuck in spurious local minima and be unable to surmount the barriers required to escape from them .",
    "bryngelson and wolynes @xcite suggested that the choice of a sequence , for which these frustration effects are minimized , is crucial ",
    "the compatibility between interacting amino acids in the native state is maximized resulting in a funnel - like landscape @xcite with few , if any , significant minima competing with the native state basin @xcite",
    ".    the limited number of protein folds @xcite house a much larger number of protein sequences in their native state .",
    "the functionality of a protein is largely controlled by its low energy modes of motion @xcite .",
    "the interactions of proteins with other proteins and its binding partners are heavily based on geometry .",
    "the equilibrium fluctuations around the native state are mainly determined by the native state structure and not by the amino acid sequence .",
    "the shape of a protein in its folded state determine the probable motions which , in turn , directly impact on function . the chicken - egg question that this poses is which is more fundamental : sequence or structure ?",
    "if sequence choice is made by the principle of minimal frustration @xcite , what determines the limited menu of folds ?",
    "strikingly , all protein native state structures are made up of the same building blocks of helices and sheets , independent of amino acid sequence , with hydrogen bonds providing the scaffolding @xcite . also , the idea that steric avoidance @xcite promotes helices and sheets is a sequence - independent result .",
    "furthermore , distinct sequences can adopt the same native state fold and multiple protein functionalities can arise within the context of a single fold @xcite .",
    "the existence of a menu of folds largely determined by the common features of all proteins rather than sequence specificity would make the role of protein sequence much less onerous than in the standard picture . the chemistry of the amino acid side - chains would then be instrumental in selecting the best - fit native fold from the pre - determined menu of folds .    from everyday experience ,",
    "the helix is a natural , compact conformation of a short , flexible tube @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the helix appears as a winning conformation of a short flexible tube under various mechanims that promote compactness @xcite .",
    "the tube is anisotropic , i.e. locally the symmetry is cylindrical instead of being spherical .",
    "one may imagine a tube to be the continuum limit of a discrete chain of discs or coins placed perpendicular to the chain axis . unlike a chain of spheres , a _ chain of discs",
    "_ accurately captures the _ symmetry _ of a chain molecule because , associated with each point along the chain , there is a special axis , defined by the tangent to the chain , perpendicular to the face of the disc .",
    "indeed , the side chains of the amino acids stick out in a direction lying approximately perpendicular to the tangent to the chain .",
    "the protein - like tube @xcite is distinct from an ordinary garden hose in that the protein backbone snakes along the axis of the tube and the space within the tube ensures that there are no steric overlaps .",
    "the crucial feature is the symmetry of the monomers or the amino acids , which can be captured either by coin - like objects or , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , by requiring that the interaction between a pair of basic constituents depends not only on their mutual distance but also on the relative orientation of their local reference frames as determined by their neighbors along the chain .    here , through new calculations ,",
    "we reassess the role played by structures and sequences in light of previous studies @xcite .",
    "first , we show that there are distinctions between the structures found in the tube model and those in simple lattice models . though the latter have elucidated important aspects of protein folding at the cost of coarse - graining , we find that lattice models do not allow for the emergence of the marginally compact phase unlike the tube model .",
    "second , we show that random hp sequences in the tube model have ground states with a high content of secondary structures , just as for homopolymers and designed hp sequences .",
    "random mutations of a designed sequence can occasionally switch the designed structure to a new structure , which still is in the marginally compact phase .",
    "this suggests that the marginally compact phase provides an efficient route for sequence design starting from random sequences of amino acids .",
    "the role of sequence is to select structures that are appropriate for functionality and to enhance the stability of folded structures .",
    "two models of polymer are considered in our study .",
    "the first @xcite corresponds to a discrete tube homopolymer chain characterized by just tube - like self - avoidance and a pairwise attraction between the monomers .",
    "the second @xcite is more sophisticated and is aimed at mimicking proteins .",
    "it satisfies the tube constraint and also has specific interactions such as bending energy , pairwise hydrophobic contact interaction , and directional hydrogen bonding with energetic and geometrical constraints .    in the first model , the polymer",
    "is modeled as a chain of @xmath0 beads , each of hard - core radius @xmath1 .",
    "the bead spacing along the chain is equal to 1 . between any pair of non - consecutive monomers",
    "there is an attraction in the form of a square - well potential of range @xmath2 . for any triplet of beads , ( @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 )",
    ", one can draw a circle of radius @xmath6 going through the positions of the beads .",
    "let @xmath7 be the radius of a self - avoiding tube whose axis is defined by the positions of the beads .",
    "the tube constraint is imposed by requiring that @xmath8 for every triplet ( @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 ) @xcite .    in the second model ,",
    "the amino acids are coarse - grained as beads located at the positions of the @xmath9 atoms , and placed along the axis of a self - avoiding tube of thickness @xmath10 .",
    "the bead spacing along the chain is 3.8@xmath11 .",
    "additionally , sterics requires that two non - consecutive @xmath9 s can not be closer than 4@xmath11 from each other . the bond angle associated with three consecutive @xmath9 atoms",
    "is constrained to stay between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the energy of a chain conformation is given by : @xmath14 where the three terms on the right hand side correspond to bending energy , hydrophobic energy , and hydrogen bonding energy , respectively .",
    "the bending energy is equal to the sum of local bending penalties along the chain .",
    "a bending penalty energy @xmath15 is applied when the local radius of curvature at a given bead is smaller than 3.2@xmath11 ( the unit @xmath16 corresponds to the energy of a local hydrogen bond ) .",
    "the hydrophobic energy is the total energy of all pairwise hydrophobic contacts between amino acids .",
    "a contact is said to be formed when two non - consecutive beads are found within a distance of 7.5@xmath11 . in a homopolymer chain of amino acids ,",
    "the contact energies are all the same and equal to @xmath17 . for hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) sequences ,",
    "only contacts between hydrophobic residues are favorable and are assigned an energy of @xmath18 per contact .",
    "contacts involving polar residues are given zero energy .",
    "hydrogen bonds have to satisfy a set of distance and angular constraints @xcite on the @xmath9s as found by a statistical analysis of native protein structures @xcite from the pdb .",
    "a local hydrogen bond is said to form between residues that are separated by three peptide bonds along the chain , and is assigned an energy @xmath19 .",
    "a non - local hydrogen bond is assigned an energy of @xmath20 .",
    "additionally , a cooperative energy of @xmath21 is given for each pair of hydrogen bonds that are formed by pairs of consecutive amino acids in the sequence .",
    "we employ a parallel tempering @xcite monte carlo scheme for obtaining the ground state as well as other equilibrium characteristics of the system . for each system ,",
    "20 to 24 replicas are considered , each evolving at its own selected temperature @xmath22 . for each replica ,",
    "the simulation is carried out with standard pivot and crankshaft move sets and the metropolis algorithm for move acceptance . in a pivot move ,",
    "one randomly chooses a bead @xmath3 and rotates the shorter part of the chain ( either from 1 through @xmath23 or from @xmath24 to @xmath0 ) by a small angle and about a randomly chosen axis that goes through the bead @xmath3 . in a crankshaft move ,",
    "two beads @xmath3 and @xmath4 are chosen randomly such that @xmath25 , and the beads between @xmath3 and @xmath4 are rotated by a small angle and about the axis that goes through @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in both move sets ,",
    "the rotation angle is drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution of zero mean and a dispersion of 4@xmath26 .",
    "an attempt to exchange replicas is made every 100 mc steps .",
    "the exchange of replicas @xmath3 and @xmath4 is accepted with a probability equal to @xmath27 \\}$ ] , where @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the energies of the replicas at the time of the exchange .",
    "the weighted multiple - histogram technique @xcite is used to compute the specific heat of the system .",
    "simplistic lattice models @xcite have provided an useful tool to address fundamental questions on protein folding and sequence design . for example , it has been found in the hp model that only a few sequences can have an unique ground state @xcite , and correspondingly , only a few structures are highly designable @xcite .",
    "consider a lattice model of a chain made up of two kinds of monomers , h and p , representing hydrophobic and polar propensities .",
    "typically one assumes an effective attraction between non - bonded neighboring h - h pairs and no other interactions otherwise . for a homopolymer comprising a chain of h monomers , all compact conformations are degenerate ground states .",
    "the degeneracy grows with chain length .",
    "one is able to optimally design the sequence of a heteropolymer in order to ensure that it has a unique ground state which is likely to be but is not necessarily maximally compact  the choice of the sequence removes the large degeneracy .    , on the tube thickness , @xmath7 , for a short homopolymer of @xmath31 beads .",
    "@xmath1 is the hard - core radius of the beads and @xmath2 is the range that defines a contact between two non - consecutive beads .",
    "the figure shows a decreasing function of @xmath32 in multiple steps as @xmath7 increases .",
    "ground state conformations are shown for several values of @xmath7 corresponding to the end of some plateaus as indicated .",
    "( b ) ground state conformations of a chain of @xmath33 beads for selected values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 as indicated .",
    "the conformations shown include a lattice - like 3x3x3 maximally compact conformation and two types of planar sheets",
    ". , width=288 ]    in contrast , for a tube , on varying the thickness , one goes from a compact phase to a marginally compact phase with relatively small degeneracy arising from the constraint that spatially nearby tube segments must lie parallel to each other as in helices and sheets .",
    "1 shows results of calculations for a discrete homopolymer in the tube picture @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the absence of the tube constraint , one gets compact conformations with significant degeneracy on maximizing the number of contacts @xcite .",
    "for the set of parameters shown in fig .",
    "1a , we have determined the maximum number of possible contacts that the polymer can have as a function of the tube thickness .",
    "the number of contacts is found to decrease in discrete steps as the tube thickness increases .",
    "we have plotted the ground state conformation at the end of each plateau corresponding to the conformation with the largest thickness ( and therefore the greatest wiggle room ) that has number of contacts equal to the plateau value .",
    "there is a sharp drop in the number of contacts as maximally compact conformations , for small values of the thickness , give way to marginally compact conformations as the thickness increases and ultimately yields the swollen phase ( with few or no contacts ) for large values of the thickness .",
    "these marginally compact conformations include the helix and the hairpin .",
    "the key point is that there is a thinning of the number of degenerate conformations in the marginally compact phase and the marginally compact conformations include the building block motifs of protein structures .",
    "this is the case even for a homopolymer .",
    "interestingly , for more finely tuned parameters and chain length one can get compact conformations of a simple cubic lattice ( fig . 1b ) . here , in the compact phase , one obtains all maximally compact 3x3x3 conformations . again on increasing the thickness , one enters the marginally compact phase - two of the conformations in this phase",
    "are also shown in the figure and are small sheets made up of zig - zag strands .",
    "our calculations show that though lattice conformations can be obtained in the tube picture , they do not belong to the marginally compact phase of a flexible tube characterized by a remarkable low degeneracy of ground state conformations .",
    "let s consider now a homopolymer in a tube model of proteins @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , by changing @xmath34 and @xmath35 , one finds a marginally compact phase of ground states and low - lying energy minimum conformations that are protein - like .",
    "it is suggested that structures in this phase constitute a menu of pre - determined folds that a protein sequence can choose from .",
    "2 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat for a homopolymer of length @xmath36 amino acids with parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 chosen such that the ground state is a three - helix bundle .",
    "the specific heat shows multiple transitions from the swollen phase at high temperatures to a collapsed phase of marginally compact structures at low temperatures .",
    "one finds that the competing energy minima to the ground state are all characterized by protein - like tertiary structures .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath37-sheets are found to be present more frequently at higher temperatures .",
    "the above result is obtained for a homopolymer and suggests that geometry and symmetry are responsible for the selection of putative native state structures even before the sequence has had a chance to weigh in .",
    "thus sequence design becomes easier and the sequence has a less onerous task in sculpting a folding funnel landscape compared to the hp lattice model , where the sequence must not only break the degeneracy of the maximally compact structures but also create a folding funnel .",
    "there are distinct advantages for protein native state structures to be at the edge of compactness . in the vicinity of a phase transition",
    "( note that we are dealing with modest sized systems and the transition will necessarily be rounded ) , the system would be expected to be exquisitely sensitive to the right kinds of perturbations conferring the amazing functionalities that proteins possess .",
    ", of a homopolymer of length of @xmath36 beads in the tube model of proteins .",
    "the model parameters are the bending energy penalty , @xmath38 , and a favorable hydrophobic energy @xmath39 between nearby beads within a distance of 7.5@xmath11 from each other , where @xmath40 denotes the magnitude of the energy of a local hydrogen bond .",
    "the data are obtained through parallel tempering monte carlo simulations and by using the weighted histogram technique .",
    "the peak of the specific heat at the higher temperature corresponds to a transition from the swollen phase to the marginally compact phase .",
    "the peak at the lower temperature corresponds to a transition between competing marginally compact conformations .",
    "helical conformations are favored at lower temperatures , whereas a structure comprised of @xmath37-sheets is preferred at higher temperatures .",
    "the ground state of the system is the three - helix bundle .",
    "representative conformations at various temperatures are shown .",
    ", width=307 ]",
    "consider now the tube model with just two types of amino acids , hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) , in which pairwise attraction is given only between the h residues . in the marginally compact phase ,",
    "it is relatively easy to design a sequence that folds to a specific structure .",
    "it was shown by hoang et al .",
    "@xcite that there are relatively simple recipes in the design procedure to get a fragment of the chain to form a helix or a @xmath37-sheet .",
    "specifically , a fragment of periodic patterns like hpph or hppph ( the h residues are separated by 2 or 3 p residues ) is likely to form a helix .",
    "in contrast , a fragment of pattern like hphph ( the h residues are separated by one p residue ) is likely to from a @xmath37-sheet .",
    "interestingly , these recipes are consistent with the successful experimental design of _ de novo _ proteins and amyloid - like fibrils @xcite .",
    "3b shows a three - helix bundle folded by a designed hp sequence .",
    "folding of this sequence is highly cooperative as demonstrated by a sharp peak in the specific heat ( fig .",
    "3c ) . in order to further assess the role of sequences ,",
    "we ask how good is the folding of random sequences compared to that of the designed sequence ?",
    "we found that , in the marginally compact phase , random sequences also have ground states characterized by a high content of secondary structures ( fig .",
    "3a ) . however , the designed sequence has significantly higher stability and folding cooperativity manifested by the position and the height of the specific heat peak respectively ( fig .",
    "the designed sequence folds with much greater ease than the random heteropolymers . at low temperatures ,",
    "the specific heat of the designed sequence is smaller than for random sequences , highlighting that , in the former case , there is a unique ground state well separated in energy from other excited states .",
    "next , we proceed to assess the robustness of designed sequences against random mutations of amino acids . for this purpose",
    ", we designed a 24-bead hp sequence ( ppphhpphhpppphphpppphphp ) that folds to a zinc - finger motif ( fig .",
    "mutations are made from h to p or vice versa .",
    "for each mutated sequence , the ground state and the equilibrium properties are calculated through parallel tempering monte carlo simulations .",
    "we found that in 17 out of 24 single point mutations , the ground state conformation does not change .",
    "these mutations include all positions in the helix region ( residues 1 - 12 ) and several positions in the @xmath37-hairpin .",
    "other single point mutations ( at positions 14,17,18,19,20,21,23 ) in the @xmath37-hairpin region completely destabilize this structure and convert it into a helix or a loop .",
    "mutations also are likely to change the height and position of the specific heat , and thus affect the folding properties of the sequence either to poorer or better ( fig .",
    "we also tried a limited number of double and triple random mutations of the original sequence and found that the zinc - finger structure can persist in about 50% of double mutations but in none of the triple mutations considered .",
    "the above results suggest that there is an efficient route for an evolutionary sequence design @xcite starting from a random sequence . in the marginally compact phase of a chain molecule ,",
    "structures are stable enough so that a single point mutation on a very short 24 amino acid chain usually does not destroy the folded state .",
    "yet a few - point mutation may switch the chain to a new conformation which can be more functionally useful . without mutational stability",
    ", it would be very hard for an evolutionary selected sequence to survive .",
    "the hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) amino acids are shown in blue and yellow respectively . the hydrophobic interaction is present only between nearby h amino acids and is assigned an energy @xmath41 in the model .",
    "the bending energy penalty is uniform for all amino acids and is equal to @xmath38 .",

    "values of @xmath44 and @xmath43 for the original sequence are indicated by horizontal dashed lines .",
    "higher @xmath43 indicates a higher stability whereas higher @xmath44 indicates a higher folding cooperativity .",

    "the tube picture not only provides an elegant explanation for the novel phase selected by nature to house biomolecular structures but also bridges this phase and conventional polymer phases on reducing the tube thickness . additionally , upon increasing the length of the chain molecule or the number of chains , one observes , in computer simulations , a crossover to semi - crystalline structures with different portions of the backbone chain lying parallel to one another as extensively verified in @xcite .",
    "significantly , this low temperature anisotropic phase of tubes provides a simple rationalization of the formation of amyloid in mis - folded proteins @xcite ( leading to deadly diseases , including alzheimer s and the mad cow disease ) and the formation of semicrystalline polymer phases @xcite .",
    "the number of ground state structures in the marginally compact phase of a tube is much smaller than the corresponding number for chains of spheres : the energy landscape is vastly simpler .",
    "second , the resulting structures are marginally compact ( the effects of attractive self - interactions have just set in ) and , because of their proximity to a phase transition to the swollen phase , are sensitive to the right type of perturbations .",
    "because protein sequences are necessarily required to select from a limited menu of folds @xcite , there is a many - to - one mapping from sequences to structures . indeed , as observed experimentally , the native state fold is often robust to mutations in which one amino acid is changed into another in accord with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "sequences evolve rapidly without any deleterious consequences in terms of functionality , because the native state fold remains the same and continues to be able to have structure - based interactions with other proteins and cell - products .",
    "also , two proteins evolutionarily related to each other are likely to share the same fold .",
    "the successful interpretation of dynamical experiments @xcite and their sensitivity to amino acid mutations follows naturally from these observations .",
    "interestingly , not all pre - sculpted structures are necessarily chosen by natural proteins as their native states @xcite .",
    "a great simplicity in understanding inanimate matter is the concept of phases .",
    "the key point is that the gross properties of a material are often determined by the phase of matter that the material resides in .",
    "one might wonder whether living matter has adopted a powerful strategy by poising the native state structures of proteins in a novel marginally compact phase of matter .",
    "this would suggest that this phase could be exploited in the laboratory for the creation of powerful nanomachines @xcite and artificial life by networking these machines to yield novel emergent behavior .",
