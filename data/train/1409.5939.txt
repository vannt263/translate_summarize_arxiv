    "the naive quark model suggests that a meson is made of a quark and an anti - quark whereas a baryon consists of three quarks .",
    "the constituents in the hadrons are bound together by the qcd interaction to constitute a color singlet .",
    "but neither the quark model nor the qcd theory ever forbids existence of multi - quark states as long as they are color - singlets . the fact that by several years of hard work all experimental trials to observe pentaquarks failed , greatly discouraged theorists and experimentalists of high energy physics even though the idea about pentaquarks is really stimulating .",
    "one may ask if the nature indeed only favors economic textures of hadrons .",
    "the situation changes by the discovery of the exotic states @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , and especially the newly observed @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of such states are that @xmath5 and @xmath6-mesons contain hidden bottom @xmath7 or charm @xmath8 respectively and both are charged , therefore they can not be simply @xmath7 or @xmath8 bound states , but multi - quark states and are called as exotic states compared to the regular structures .",
    "the inner structure of the multi - quark states is more complicated than the regular mesons that the exotic states can be molecular states or tetraquarks or their mixtures .",
    "the molecular state is constructed by two color singlet mesons . a strong point to support such",
    "a structure is that the mass of the newly discovered meson @xmath0 is close to the sum of the masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while the mass of @xmath2 is also close to a sum of @xmath11 and @xmath12 masses .",
    "instead , the study on the decay modes of such mesons seem to support the tetraquark structure @xcite . to clarify the structures of those exotic states , one may need to investigate their all characteristics based on fundamental dynamics , instead of simply considering closeness of their masses with the sum of the constituents .    one observation may call our attention .",
    "the resonances @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been experimentally observed and confirmed as exotic four - quark states .",
    "many authors @xcite assumed them to be molecular states of @xmath9 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( and the corresponding anti - mesons ) which are well experimentally measured .",
    "there is a common point that the masses of the observed exotic mesons are larger than the sum of the supposed constituent mesons .",
    "concretely , @xmath14 mev @xcite ( the mass of @xmath0 ) is larger than sum of masses of @xmath9 and @xmath13 ( 10604.45 mev ) ; @xmath15 mev @xcite ( the mass of @xmath1 ) is larger than sum of masses of @xmath13 and @xmath13 ( 10650.4 mev ) ; @xmath16 mev @xcite ( the mass of @xmath2 ) is larger than sum of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( 3876.6 mev ) ; @xmath17 mev @xcite ( the mass of @xmath3 ) is larger than sum of @xmath12 and @xmath12 ( 4013.96 mev ) .",
    "generally , unless there exists a linearly increasing potential ( such as the confinement potential for quarks ) or a barrier , the binding energy of two constituent mesons which is caused by exchanging color - singlet hadrons must be negative .",
    "thus , by the common sense the mass of a composite meson should be smaller than the sum of the two ( or more ) constituent masses .",
    "moreover as estimated by some authors @xcite the masses of those exotic states are also larger than the sums of masses of the concerned diquark and anti - diquark . in our calculation , even though the sum of the two diquark masses is larger than the mass of the corresponding exotic meson , the negative binding energy still makes the resultant total energy smaller than the exotic meson . that may imply neither molecular nor teraquark states alone correspond to the observed exotic mesons .",
    "our study indicates that only their mixture provides a reasonable picture for the four - quark states .",
    "thus , both molecular state and teraquark state should exist , even though they may not be physical states which we observe in experiments .    by the born - oppenheimer @xcite approximation",
    ", the potential between atoms can be approximated as a function of the distance between two nuclei , by the scheme , heitler and london @xcite calculated the spectrum of hydrogen molecule . in that case , the two protons are supposed to be at rest and the two electrons are moving .",
    "since the two electrons are identical fermions , the wavefunction of the two - electron system must be totally anti - symmetric .",
    "it was found that there is only one energy minimum corresponding to the triplet .",
    "namely , in the hydrogen molecule the two electrons must be in the spin - triplet .    comparing with the hydrogen molecule , @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 )",
    "is made of four quarks : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 stands for @xmath20 or @xmath21 quark , since @xmath22 are much heavier than the light flavors , so we can approximate them to be at rest .",
    "thus it is natural that we can separate the four quarks into two groups .",
    "one possibility is that each group is in a color singlet , which corresponds to a molecular state , whereas another possibility is that one group containing @xmath23 is in a color - anti - triplet(or a sextet ) and the other group containing @xmath24 is in a color - triplet ( or an anti - sextet ) , i.e. the dipole - anti - dipole structure . since @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not identical particles , the wavefunction does not need to be anti - symmetrized . by the born - oppenheimer approximations ,",
    "the potential between two groups can be a function of distance between @xmath19 and @xmath27 and interactions between the two groups are taken as a perturbation . since the interactions between quarks are complicated , calculation of the energy spectrum of the exotic state is much more difficult than for hydrogen molecule .",
    "it is noted that braaten et al.@xcite also consider the born - oppenheimer potential to deal with the four - quark states .",
    "first we need to determine the wavefunctions of the color singlet of @xmath28 and the color - anti - triplet ( or sextet ) dipole @xmath29(color - triplet or anti - sextet @xmath30 . here",
    "we use the cornell potential @xcite as the interaction between the quarks and since the light flavors are relativistic , following the literature , we employ the schrdinger - like equation with relativistic kinematics . the effective interaction between the quarks ( quark - anti - quark ) which belong to different groups",
    "is complicated , because not only the short - distance qcd interaction exists , but also the long - distance interaction which can be treated by exchanging color - singlet light mesons : @xmath31 and @xmath32 etc .",
    "( for the molecule case ) or the color - flux tube ( for the tetraquark case ) plays important roles .",
    "here we do not involve the strange flavor . in analog to the hydrogen molecule , we calculate the spectrum of the ground state of the four - quark system ( the molecule and tetraquark separately ) .",
    "our strategy is similar to the heitler - london approximation , namely we take the products of the two meson wavefunctions(for the molecule ) and diquark - anti - diquark wavefunctions ( for the tetraquark ) as two independent trial functions and calculate the interaction between two groups to obtain the spectra as functions of the distance between @xmath20 and @xmath33 ( @xmath21 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "our goal is to see whether the molecular state or tetraquark state can possess energy minima with respect to the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath27 , by which one can judge if molecule or tetraquark can be physically allowed . if there exist minima for both cases , we would conclude that both structures are probable and the real physical state could be a mixture of the two structures .",
    "( in fact , our computations confirm that there are minima for both . )",
    "this work is organized as follows , after this long introduction , we would formulate the expressions for the energy spectra .",
    "we first present relevant effective potentials for the meson and diquark which are composed of a heavy quark and a light flavor and then derive the born - oppenheimer potentials for both molecule and tetraquark . in sec .",
    "[ formulae ] , we discuss the explicit color , spin structures of the molecular and tetraquark states and solving the schrdinger - like equation to obtain the spatial wavefunctions of color - singlet meson and color - anti - triplet diquark . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , along with all input parameters we present our numerical results which show that for both molecule and tetraquark there exist minima with repect to the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath27 .",
    "the last section is devoted to our discussion and conclusion .",
    "in this section , we derive the theoretical formulae for calculating the mass spectra and wavefunctions of both molecular and tetraquark states . we first by solving the schrdinger - like equations to obtain the mass spectra and wavefunctions of the mesons @xmath35 and @xmath12 and diquark ( anti - diquark ) which would be the trial functions for later calculation .",
    "but it is noted , since diquark is not a physical state , we determine its mass spectrum and wavefunction via theoretical computations .",
    "we go on using the born - oppenheimer approximation to evaluate the mass spectra of molecular and tetraquark states which are functions of the distance between two heavy constituents @xmath19 and @xmath27 .      here",
    "we first obtain the effective potentials between concerned constituents inside a color - singlet , i.e. mesons and color - triplet ( anti - triplet ) , i.e. anti - diquark(diquark ) .",
    "then we go on to derive the potential between constituents coming from different groups .",
    "for the two distinct configurations(the molecular state and tetraquark ( diquark - antidiquark ) state ( see fig . [",
    "fig : config ] ) , the effective interactions are different .          in this subsection ,",
    "let us first discuss the interactions among the constituents inside a meson ( @xmath36 ) or a ( anti)diquark(@xmath37 ) .",
    "the general hamiltonian can be written as @xmath38 where the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the 3-momenta of the light flavor @xmath41 and heavy one @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the interaction potential is @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the distance between quarks ( quark - antiquark ) .",

    "@xmath20 is the string tension , and @xmath21 is a global zero - point energy .",
    "@xmath54 is the qcd running coupling constant , which depends on the re - normalization scale @xmath55 @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the reduced mass of the @xmath58 system and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are fitted parameters .",
    "the framework can be generalized to the case for diquark(anti - diqaurk ) which involves two quarks ( two anti - quarks ) .",
    "the @xmath62-function in eq.([eq : voge ] ) is replaced by a gaussian smearing function @xcite with a fitted parameter @xmath63",
    "@xmath64      now we specify the interaction between the two mesons for the molecular structures(see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] ) .",
    "since the constituent mesons are in color singlet , the quarks ( antiquarks ) in one meson do not interact with the quarks in another meson via exchanging a single gluon , thus the interaction between @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) only comes from the meson - exchange between the light flavors @xmath67 .",
    "the constituent quark model was thoroughly studied by many authors , for example , vijande et al .",
    "@xcite , and its successful applications to phenomenology are noted , thus here we employ it to derive the effective interaction between mesons .",
    "the interactions @xmath68 induced by meson - exchange(me ) between @xmath69 and @xmath70 includes contributions of pseudoscalar@xmath71 and scalar@xmath72 , @xmath73      + v_{\\sigma}(r_{ij}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the explicit form of the interactions are @xmath74    ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_i\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma_j$}}),\\ ] ]    @xmath75\\ ] ]    with @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the @xmath78 flavor matrices .",
    "@xmath79 is the yukawa function , @xmath80 is the chiral coupling constant , @xmath81 is the mixing angle for the physical @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the chiral symmetry breaking scales .",
    "once the potential between @xmath85 is determined , the corresponding potential for @xmath67 can also be obtained from a @xmath86-parity transformation @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the employed framework is the su(3 ) chiral quark model where the heavy quark ( @xmath21 or @xmath20 ) does not couple to the su(3 ) mesons .",
    "furthermore , in the effective potential there also exists a piece @xmath87 induced by quark - antiquark @xmath88 pair annihilation into a light mesons which mediate interactions in s - channel . to the lowest order",
    "the quark - antiquark pair resides in an s - wave state , the contribution of @xmath89-meson(@xmath90 ) can be neglected @xcite .",
    "so here we only keep the contributions of @xmath91 and @xmath32 to the potential @xcite @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the isospin operator , and the @xmath62-function is also rewritten in the same form as eq.[eq : delta ] .    summing all the individual pieces up ,",
    "the interaction between the two mesons of the molecule is @xmath95      now , for the case of tetraquark , we are dealing with the interaction between the two groups @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the key point is to derive an effective potential .",
    "the total hamiltonian is written as @xmath98\\ ] ]    the interaction among constituents in diquark and that in anti - diquark is not simply determined by the perturbative qcd , becuse the short - distance and long - distance contributions exist simultaneously . following brodsky et al.@xcite",
    ", the flux tube model may properly describe the interaction for the tetraquark case . meanwhile in this case the contributions of the meson exchanges can be safely ignored comparing with that of gluon exchange @xcite .",
    "the general form of hamiltonian in the flux - tube model can also be decomposed into the coulomb - type piece which is responsible for short distance interaction and the confinement piece for the long - distance interaction . as",
    "brodsky et al.@xcite suggested , in a  substantial separation \" , diquark and antidiquark are connected by the flux - tube .",
    "it is noted that in our pictures according to the heitler - london approximation , we need to consider all the interactions among the constituents of different groups , thus we account for the interactions as shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] . obviously , as summing over all the contributions a resultant born - oppenheimer potential",
    "would be obtained which is also an effective flux tube between the diqaurk and anti - diquark and it is the picture of ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , as is well known , when the tension on the sting is beyond a certain bound the string would be broken into two stings and at the new ends a quark - anti - quark pair is created@xcite .",
    "one can use a step function to describe the breaking effect as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a parameter corresponds to the strengthening limit of the string .",
    "a typical scale for non - perturbative qcd is @xmath101 , therefore it is natural to consider @xmath102 . just as smearing the delta function , we need also to smear the step function .",
    "in fact @xmath103 smearing the step function implies that we keep @xmath104 as a non - zero free parameter to be determined .    here",
    "the interaction between @xmath69 of diquark and @xmath70 from the antidiquark at a relatively large distance is described by a modified form as @xmath105 and @xmath104 is a parameter in fm , and we set @xmath106 in this work .          in the essence of the born - oppenheimer approximation , we can choose the product of the two clusters s wavefunctions as the basis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] @xmath108    the radial wave function for each cluster is obtained by solving the schrdinger - like equation @xmath109\\phi_{\\kappa}=e\\phi_\\kappa , ~~\\kappa = u\\bar{q},\\bar{d}q , uq,\\bar{d}\\bar{q},\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath110 takes the cornell type potential ( see eq.([eq : voge ] ) and eq.([eq : vcon ] ) ) , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the masses of light@xmath113 and heavy @xmath114 quarks .",

    "our numerical results indicate that for both molecule and tetraquark states , the functions of the binding energies possess minima . for the case of molecular states ,",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath120 fm ( for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , see table .",
    "[ tab : minima ] ) , whereas , for the tetraquark , @xmath121=0.79@xmath1221.5 fm depending on the parameter @xmath104 where @xmath121 is the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath27 . the situations for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are slightly different , but roughly the tendency is the same .",
    "it is also noted that the resultant @xmath121 is flavor dependent , but no matter for @xmath21 or @xmath20 , it falls within a reasonable range i.e. roughly @xmath123 .",
    "ccc +    a few observations on the results .",
    "first from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one notices that the local minimum is a metastable one and for @xmath124 fm , the binding energy drops drastically . it may imply that there could be an anarchy state for a four - quark system .",
    "but it is only a qualitative inference , then the computed value for the binding energy is not reliable because here the adopted picture is only valid for the diqark - anti - diquark structure instead of the anarchy state .",
    "the main conclusion is that there are minima for both molecule and tetraquark structures , so that both of them can exist , a natural mixture would be expected .",
    "the mixing between molecular structure and tetraquark is induced by exchanging quark and anti - quark which reside in different groups ( fig . [",
    "fig : mix ] ) .",
    "such mechanism has been discussed in literature@xcite , but because it is a non - perturbative qcd effect , there is no appropriate way to calculate @xmath125 yet .",

    "[ tab : minima ] , table .",
    "[ tab : tetra - spectra ] and @xmath126 of eq.([eigenvalue ] ) , we obtain @xmath127 .    with the provided picture , we predict the positions of the partners of @xmath128 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath129 which weakly depend on the value of @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the key point to validate or negate our picture is to look for the counter - partners of the observed exotic mesons . however , since the masses of the expected mesons are below the production thresholds of @xmath118-@xmath130 or @xmath119-@xmath131 ( which can be realized in @xmath5 decays but not in @xmath6 s ) , one should look for them in the decay modes such @xmath132 etc .    to require quantitatively reliable conclusion , more information ( theoretical and especially experimental ) is needed .",
    "indeed the more accurate data are being accumulated , and we hope that more measurements will be carried out at bes , superbelle and lhcb , as well as the other proposed colliders .",
