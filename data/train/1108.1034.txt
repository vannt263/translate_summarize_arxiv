    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite , introduced in the middle of 70 s as a mean - field model for spin glasses , has played and important role besides the study of spin glasses .",
    "the search for its solution in the low temperature phase , the spin glass ( sg ) phase , has lead to the introduction and development of tools such as the _ replica method _ and the concept of _ replica symmetry breaking _ , that have found applications in a variety of other fields of the complex - system world , just to cite a few , neural networks , combinatorial optimization and glassy physics .",
    "the signature of the sg state is the presence of a large number of degenerate , locally stable states . when the system is driven into the sg phase , the spins almost freeze and fluctuate along local fixed directions .",
    "thus , similar to what happens in the low temperature phase of a ferromagnet , the thermal average of a single spin does not vanishes in the sg phase . yet , at difference with a ferromagnet , the local directions may change from spin to spin without any special rule , that is in a random way . therefore the sg phase is not characterized by a long range ordering . also ,",
    "since each spin can choose among different local directions , the sg phase is actually made by a large number of degenerate locally stable states .",
    "if we take a shot of one of such sg state , we shall discover that it is not distinguishable from a paramagnetic , i.e. , disordered state .",
    "thus we can think of the sg phase made by a large set of almost frozen paramagnetic ( disordered ) states .",
    "direct consequence of such a scenario is that identical ideal replicas of the system , indistinguishable in the paramagnetic phase , when driven into the sg phase may end up into different sg states and , hence , becoming distinguishable .",
    "the symmetry among replicas is then _",
    "broken_.    the solution of the sk model which accounts for this scenario was found at the end of the 70 s , and it is now know as the `` parisi solution '' @xcite . since then many of its properties have been studied and understood .",
    "some questions , however , are still open , among them its validity for finite dimensional systems . despite the subtleties , and mathematical ambiguities , of the replica method , see e.g. @xcite , it is now accepted that the parisi solution is correct for the mean - field sk model . for finite dimensional systems",
    "it is less clear and a different scenario , the _ droplet _ picture , an essentially replica symmetric description , as been put forward .",
    "the connection between the two is still not fully understood .    in this paper",
    "we shall discuss sk model replica symmetry breaking solutions that are obtained by expanding about the replica symmetric solution .",
    "the interest for these solutions is twofold : from one side one can investigate the set up of the replica symmetry breaking in the sg phase .",
    "the study of these solutions is also relevant for the definition of a field theory description of the sg phase that could be used to investigate the crossover from mean - field to the finite dimensional systems .",
    "in the last part of the paper we shall briefly discuss the solution of the sk model in the limit @xmath9 , where an ( almost ) replica symmetric description arises .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model in absence of external fields is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 are ising spins and the symmetric couplings @xmath12 are i.i.d .",

    "@xmath18 , and hence @xmath19 , is a random quantity .",
    "we must therefore average the free energy @xmath19 over the disorder . to overcome the difficulties of averaging a logarithm ,",

    "the reason for such a behaviour is that the frsb `` opens '' around the rs solution @xmath130 .",

    "symmetry @xmath128 must vanish .",
    "the finite value of @xmath128 then indicates that more terms in the expansion ( [ eq : freenc ] ) must be retained in order to balance the drag from @xmath37 .",

    "physically this means by performing the expansion around the paramagnetic solution . in this case",

    "this model is based on an expansion that retains only the main mathematical structure of the expansion of the replicated free energy in powers of @xmath30 near @xmath1 , where @xmath133 , but , similar to the landau lagrangian , with arbitrary coefficients .",
    "the mapping between the expansion ( [ eq : freen4c ] ) with @xmath43 and the truncated model is @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 with arbitrary @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in this case , if @xmath139 and @xmath138 are temperature independent , the frsb solution exists only down to @xmath140 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the rs solution can be taken as a starting point for a development of the frsb solution for @xmath141 .",
    "as the temperature becomes significantly lower than @xmath1 the expansion looses physical meaning and more and more terms are needed into the expansion to extend its validity .",
    "due to the particular structure of the expansion , in powers of @xmath142 , it is likely that an infinite subset of terms should be considered to tackle with very low temperatures .",
    "surprisingly a replica symmetric description appears at @xmath53 .",
    "indeed as the temperature is lowered towards @xmath48 the probability that @xmath143 remains finite , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath144 as @xmath53 @xcite . at the same time the probability of finding overlaps @xmath30 _",
    "significantly smaller _ than @xmath145 vanishes with @xmath0 .",
    "then , since @xmath146 , for @xmath9 the order parameter function @xmath70 undergoes an abrupt and rapid change of @xmath147 in a tiny boundary layer of thickness @xmath148 close to @xmath127 , while it is slowly varying for @xmath149 , as depicted in fig .",

    "this behaviour of @xmath70 has strong consequences on other relevant quantities and , also , on the structure of the eigenvalue spectrum of the hessian of the fluctuations governing the stability of the stationary point . for what concerns the stability one finds @xcite that in the region @xmath160 , where @xmath70 varies rapidly from @xmath153 up to @xmath161 ,",
    "the spectrum of the hessian of the fluctuations maintains the complex structure of the frsb solution found close to @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the eigenvalue spectrum has a completely different aspect .",
    "the bands observed in the frsb regime collapse and only two distinct eigenvalues are found : a null one and a positive one @xcite .",

    "we note that zero modes arise from the replicon geometry , with ward - takahashi identities protecting them @xcite , and arises also from the longitudinal - anomalous geometry , without protection of the ward - takahashi identities .",
    "it is worth to observe that the stability analysis of the rs solution also leads to two eigenvalues , one of which is zero to the lowest order in @xmath51 ( and negative to higher order ) and a positive one @xcite .    from the expression ( [ eq : pank ] )",
    "it follows that the variation of @xmath70 in the outer region , @xmath162 , is @xmath163 / q(x ) \\sim c ( t / x)^2 $ ] , rather weak for @xmath53 .",

    "moreover the value of @xmath128 is finite and vanishes only for @xmath49 with the third power of the temperature difference .",
