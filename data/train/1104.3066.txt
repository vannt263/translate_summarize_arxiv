    "black hole is one of the most interesting objects in physics .",
    "the study of black hole thermodynamics @xcite is therefore quite important .",
    "black holes are indeed thermodynamical objects with a physical temperature and an entropy . it has been known over the past few decades that thermodynamics of black holes provides an important tool for understanding several issues involving quantum theories of gravity .",
    "these have been intensely discussed for the recent past .",
    "however , there is no microscopic or statistical description behind their thermodynamical behavior , although thermodynamic studies of black holes do indicate extremely rich phase structures and critical phenomena in these systems .",
    "we can consider black holes as states in a thermodynamical ensemble and to study phase transition in black holes .",
    "a well - known example is due to hawking and page @xcite .",
    "motivated by these ideas , much work has been done on phase structure of black holes , quite rich phase structure and critical phenomena has been found @xcite .    recently , the study of phase transitions of black holes in asymptotically anti de - sitter spacetime @xcite has focused much interest since these transitions have been related with holographic superconductivity @xcite in the context of the ads / cft correspondence ( see relevant reviews in @xcite ) . in this paper , we first review a thermodynamic analogy between a @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole and a van der waals liquid gas system first discovered in @xcite . from this analogy",
    "we calculate the critical exponents of relevant thermodynamical quantities and discuss the scaling symmetry of the free energy .",
    "then we compare the critical exponents with the known case of a four dimensional rn - ads black hole @xcite and a van der waals liquid gas system @xcite and also check whether these exponents satisfy the scaling law for the singular part of the free energy near criticality . among the results we get",
    ", we find that the critical exponents of the four dimensional rn - ads black hole in @xcite have some errors .",
    "but we find identical exponents between the @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole and the van der waals liquid gas system , and possible universality in the phase transitions of these systems .",
    "furthermore we study the phase transition using a geometrical perspective of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "this approach has been developed over the last few decades @xcite .",
    "we find the scalar curvature diverges precisely at the van der waals - like critical point where the heat capacity at constant charge of the black hole diverges .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly discuss the thermodynamics of the @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole , mainly using it to establish our notations and obtain formulae of thermodynamic functions for later use . in section iii we study the critical behavior of the @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole at the van der waals - like critical point .",
    "further , in section iv , we study the state space scalar curvature of the @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole in detail .",
    "finally , section v contain a discussion of our results .",
    "the theme of the present sec . is to give an overview of the singular behavior of the heat capacity at constant charge of a @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole which forms the background of this work . for more details of the spherical case ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently , motivated by the study of holographic superconductivity @xcite , plane symmetric and hyperbola symmetric cases in special dimensions are also discussed @xcite .",
    "now we consider general @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black holes .",
    "the form of the spacetime metric is @xmath1 where , where all symbols have their usual meanings . ]",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 is the cosmological constant . here",
    "@xmath4 corresponds to the sphere , plane and hyperbola symmetric cases respectively and @xmath5 is the metric of the associated @xmath6-dimensional base manifold .    the mass of the black hole is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the value of @xmath9 at the horizon .",
    "using the bekenstein - hawking formula , we have @xmath10    it is now possible to determine the other thermodynamic entities using the basic thermodynamic relations @xmath11 these are defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the potential difference between the horizon and infinity , @xmath14 is the hawking temperature , @xmath15 is the entropy and @xmath16 is the heat capacity at constant charge of the black hole .    for a non - extreme black hole",
    ", it can be seen from ( [ hc ] ) that @xmath16 is always positive and regular for the @xmath17 cases , which tells us that there is no phase transition happening .",
    "however , for the spherically symmetry case @xmath18 , @xmath16 will become singular for a certain set of black hole parameters @xmath19 at which @xmath20 considering the equation ( [ sin ] ) , we then find that the critical points are given in terms of the radius of the event horizon as @xmath21 when @xmath22 .",
    "for the special value @xmath23 , the two horizons degenerate , so we denote @xmath24 .     for @xmath25 . ]    for fixed q so that @xmath26 , @xmath27 when @xmath28 and @xmath29 when @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so across the critical points at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , there is a change of thermodynamic stability of a black hole ( see fig.([fi1 ] ) ) .     for @xmath34 . ]    in the limit @xmath35 approaches the critical value @xmath36 , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 degenerate into @xmath37 . in this case , @xmath16 remains positive and the unstable phase of a black hole disappears ( see fig.([fi2 ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath35 is greater than @xmath36 , the heat capacity @xmath16 of the rn - ads black hole is always regular .",
    "as described in ii , when the charge of a rn - ads black hole reaches the critical value @xmath38,the critical points at @xmath32 and @xmath33 degenerate into a single critical point located at @xmath37 .",
    "the thermally unstable phase of a rn - ads black hole disappears ( see fig.([fi2 ] ) ) .",
    "the theme of this section is to study the critical thermodynamic behavior of a rn - ads black hole near @xmath37 . to this end , we shall first review a thermodynamic analogy between a rn - ads black hole and a van der waals liquid gas system .",
    "the analogy , though incomplete , will still serve as a very useful guide in the study of the critical behavior of a rn - ads black hole in the vicinity of @xmath37 .",
    "given the potential at the event horizon @xmath39 , the equation of state ( [ tem ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath40 in term of the thermodynamical variables @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 and @xmath43    it may be inferred from ( [ par ] ) that , like a subcritical isotherm of a van der waals liquid gas system in the @xmath44 phase plane , an isotherm of a rn - ads black hole with @xmath45 also has a local maxima and minima located respectively at @xmath46 and @xmath47 . along the segment of the isotherm between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "a rn - ads black hole is in a thermally unstable phase with @xmath48 ( see fig.([fi3 ] ) ) .    .",
    "the local maxima and minima located respectively at @xmath46 and @xmath47 are critical points of @xmath16 . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the black hole is unstable with @xmath48.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the limit when @xmath50 is reached , the shape of the isotherm undergo noticeable change ( see fig.([fi4 ] ) ) and the critical points located at @xmath46 and @xmath47 on a subcritical isotherm coalesce into a single critical point located at @xmath51 at the critical isotherm .",
    "the critical point at @xmath52 coincides with that located at @xmath37 on the critical isocharge curve with @xmath34 .    .",
    "the point of inflection located at @xmath52 is a critical point of @xmath16 , @xmath29 along the critical isotherm.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    like the case of the van der waals liquid gas system , the critical point at the critical isotherm ( along which @xmath53 ) of a rn - ads black hole is also a point of inflection of the critical isotherm and may be characterized by @xmath54 @xmath55 where the subscript @xmath56 denotes the corresponding quantity evaluated at the critical point at @xmath37 from now on . in view of the above similarities ,",
    "if we formally identify the variables @xmath41 of a rn - ads black hole with @xmath44 of a van der waals liquid gas system , then we see that , at least at a qualitative level , the phase structure of a rn - ads black hole does bear certain remarkable resemblances to that of a van der waals liquid gas system .      in analogy to a van der waals liquid gas system , an order parameter in the rn - ads context which measures the phase change across the critical at @xmath37",
    "may also be defined in terms of the maxwell equal - area law .",
    "to do so , in the @xmath41 phase plane , fix a subcritical isotherm and draw a horizontal line which interests the subcritical isotherm at points @xmath57 ( see fig.([fi5 ] ) ) such that the area bounded by the horizontal line segment @xmath58 and the isotherm is equal to that bounded by the line segment @xmath59 and the isotherm .     and @xmath60 of the subcritical isotherm .",
    "the area bounded by the line segment @xmath58 and the isotherm is equal to that bounded by the line segment @xmath59 and the isotherm.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as in the case of a van der waals liquid gas system , define    @xmath61    as the order parameter to describe the phase change of a rnads black hole near @xmath37 .      near the critical point at the critical isotherm ,",
    "the critical behavior of a van der waals liquid gas system may be described in terms of @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 with the formal correspondence @xmath66 as described in the preceding subsection , analogous quantities may also be defined for a rn - ads black hole .",
    "the concrete values of the corresponding critical exponents in the case of a rn - ads black hole can also be worked out as follows .",
    "@xmath67    using the equation of state ( [ state ] ) , we have @xmath68 in order to examine the neighborhood of the critical point , we introduce expansion parameter @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the neighborhood of the critical point , ( [ qstate ] ) can be written @xmath71 where @xmath72 the coefficient of @xmath73 in the expansion .",
    "let @xmath74 in ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath75 where @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 this means @xmath79",
    "@xmath80    in the neighbourhood of the critical point , we have ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath81 on either side of the coexistence curve can be found from the conditions that along the isotherm , @xmath82 and @xmath83 let @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "substitute ( [ exp ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 in order for ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) to be consistent , we must have @xmath88 .",
    "if we plug this into ( [ eq1 ] ) or ( [ eq2 ] ) , we get @xmath89 .",
    "this gives @xmath90 thus , @xmath91 this means @xmath92",
    "@xmath93    from ( [ entr ] ) , ( [ tem ] ) and ( [ pot ] ) , we have @xmath94 from ( [ hcp ] ) , we see that @xmath95 display no singular behavior at the critical point . therefore @xmath96",
    "@xmath97    let us compute @xmath98 .",
    "we obtain @xmath99 for @xmath100 one approaches the critical point along the critical isochore . then set @xmath101",
    ", we obtain @xmath102 for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore @xmath103 for @xmath45 one approaches the critical point along the coexistence curve .",
    "then set @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath105 for @xmath104",
    ". therefore @xmath106      in the case of a van der waals liquid gas system , scaling symmetry exists for the singular part of the gibbs free energy near the critical point located at the critical isotherm and the critical exponents may all be expressed in terms of the two independent homogeneity degrees of the gibbs energy @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we shall show that similar scaling symmetry also exists for a rn - ads black hole .",
    "the behavior of gibbs free energy near the critical point is similar to van der waals system , from which scaling laws for the critical exponents can be derived . scaling symmetry in the black hole critical phenomena",
    "was first discussed in @xcite in the context of of kerr - newman black holes .    sufficiently close to @xmath37 , the gibbs free energy for a rn - ads black hole may be written as @xmath107 . here",
    "@xmath108 is the regular part of the gibbs free energy whose second order partial derivatives are well behaved at the critical point at @xmath37 , and @xmath109 is the part of the gibbs free energy responsible for the singular thermodynamic behavior of a rn - ads black hole near @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath109 can be further worked out to be @xmath110 for some constant @xmath111 dependent on @xmath112 . from ( [ ge ] ) , we find @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 a real constant . as in the case of a van der waals liquid - gas system , the critical exponents derived in the previous section can be expressed in terms of @xmath116 as @xmath117 from ( [ sl1 ] ) , it may also be seen that the critical exponents in the critical regime of @xmath37 are not independent .",
    "they are related by following equations @xcite : @xmath118 apart from obtaining the algebraic relations among the critical exponents , ( [ sl1 ] ) or ( [ sl2 ] ) also enable us to give a consistency check of the validity of the critical exponents obtained in sec .",
    "in this section , we will study the critical phenomena of rn - ads black holes using thermodynamic geometry .",
    "the hessian of the entropy function ( or other thermodynamical potentials ) can be thought of as a metric tensor on the state space @xcite . in the context of thermodynamical fluctuation theory ruppeiner",
    "has argued that the riemannian geometry of this metric gives insight into the underlying statistical mechanical system . in this picture the occurrence of a van der waals critical point is connected with the divergence of the state space scalar curvature .",
    "the metric as defined by ruppeiner @xcite is given by , @xmath119 where the coordinates @xmath120 are chosen to be the extensive variables of the system .",
    "in fact , it is convenient to use the weinhold metric which is defined in the following way @xcite , @xmath121 where we use @xmath122 to denote the internal energy .",
    "it is well known that the line elements in ruppeiner geometry and the weinhold geometry are conformally related by @xcite @xmath123 where t is the temperature of the rn - ads black hole . in this picture",
    "we will consider @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .    from ( [ mass ] ) , ( [ entr ] ) , ( [ tem ] ) , ( [ pot ] ) and ( [ hc ] ) , we have @xmath127 now using ( [ mass2 ] ) and ( [ tem2 ] ) we can easily calculate the ruppeiner metric @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 observe that all the metric components have an identical denominator which appears in the expression of the temperature .",
    "our concern is the scalar curvature of the ruppeiner metric , which is @xmath131 where @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 is a regular function whose explicit form is irrelevant to the singular behavior of @xmath135 .",
    "the function @xmath136 is always positive due to the nonextremal condition , as can be seen from ( [ tem2 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath137 is identical with the denominator of the heat capacity at constant charge ( [ hc2 ] ) .",
    "hence the scalar curvature will diverge exactly at those points at which the heat capacity diverges .",
    "it is easy to see that there are two singular points when temperature above @xmath50 and these two points coincide as @xmath53 , so the thermal geometry method gives the same result which we have found in section iii .",
    "in the present work , we have obtained different thermodynamic entities like temperature , potential and heat capacity at constant charge for a @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole from the first law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the heat capacity shows a divergence at the van der waals - like critical point .",
    "moreover , we have investigated the critical behavior of the @xmath0-dimensional rn - ads black hole at the van der waals - like critical point .",
    "one of the striking characteristics of the phase transition is the fact that many measures of a system s behavior near a critical point are independent of the details of the interactions between the particles making up the system .",
    "the universal features are not only independent of the numerical details of the interparticle interactions , but are also independent of the most fundamental aspects of the structure of the system .",
    "the critical exponents of a @xmath138-dimensional rn - ads black hole and a van der waals liquid gas system are exactly the same .",
    "this result is quite interesting because of the differences in the physical property of the two systems .",
    "we have also studied the phase transition using the geometrical perspective of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we find that both the scalar curvature and the heat capacity at constant charge have a common denominator and hence diverge at identical points .",
    "this shows that a divergence in the scalar curvature corresponds to a divergence in the heat capacity at constant charge thereby suggesting the occurrence of a phase transition .",
    "moreover , there is another factor in the denominator of the scalar curvature which is the same expression arising in the expression for the temperature ( [ tem2 ] ) .",
    "so we can not put it equal to zero due to the nonextremal condition .",
    "therefore we can easily get information about the occurrence of phase transition from the scalar curvature .",
    "we have found that the van der waals - like critical behavior does not present in the planar or hyperbolic rn - ads black holes .",
    "but we know that there is another type of phase transition associated with a scalar hair in the planar case @xcite . based on the ads / cft correspondence , this type of phase transition describes the superconductivity phase transition in the dual boundary system ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which has been proved a powerful tool to study superconductivity phenomena . in our case , the boundary system dual to the spherical rn - ads black hole should also have critical behavior dual to the van der waals - like critical behavior in the bulk .",
    "so , it is quite natural to ask whether this dual boundary theory also describes some important , realistic phenomena of phase transition in physics .",
    "we have also observed that rn - ds black holes do not posses the van der waals - like phase transition , while the hawking - page phase transition can occur in this kind of background @xcite .",
    "so , we see that the asymptotic ads background is crucial for the van der waals - like phase transition .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon .",
