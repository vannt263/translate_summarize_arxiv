    "optical bottle beams that contain an intensity null point generated considerable interest due to their potential application in optical confinement of laser - cooled atoms and in optical tweezers systems @xcite .",
    "this bottling effect appears when plane waves in the fourier expansion of beams interfere destructively to generate a bottle or a null intensity point at the center of the beam .",
    "conventional hollow beams used in optical tweezers and following the abovementioned basic concept are laguerre - gaussian beams .",
    "more recently , an optical scheme for realizing a supersized light capsule was presented theoretically and experimentally in air , where the volume of darkness inside the light capsule can be changed in a wide range @xcite . in this case ,",
    "a binary phase mask was used to create such a tunable antiresolution region .",
    "alternatively , wave fields exhibiting a peak intensity of curvilinear trajectory that additionally constitutes the closed boundary of a geometrical shadow , instead of a null point , have been proposed to be used as optical bottles @xcite .",
    "a well - known example of this kind of wave fields are the so - called airy beams . unlike ordinary optical wavefronts , airy beams transversely accelerate , preserving their intensity profile throughout propagation but the profile s features follow a curved path @xcite . by appropriately superimposing mirror - symmetric airy beams , the field amplitude oscillates outward of a dark closed region @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions were subsequently verified by experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the resulting caustic surface that abruptly emerges and subsequently autofocuses was used as an optical bottle to trap and manipulate dielectric microparticles @xcite .",
    "the intensity peak of an airy beam follows a parabolic trajectory much like the ballistics of projectiles .",
    "the shape of the optical bottle produced by this sort of paraxial accelerating beam is also governed by the parabolic caustic curve .",
    "this fundamental limit may be overcome since fourier - space generation of arbitrary accelerating beams allow the propagation along controlled curvilinear trajectories @xcite .",
    "for instance , nonparaxial accelerating waves in two dimensions , whose intensity profiles are roughly preserved within a range of propagation distances , and whose maxima follow semicircular paths , were recently proposed @xcite .",
    "such a beam with bessel signature should be able to bend from a launch angle of @xmath0 perpendicular to the original direction of propagation all the way to an angle of zero , and immediately accelerating to propagate at angles close to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the wave field will propagate backward in the remainder half circular trajectory , a fact that in practice limits the formation of light capsules of circular symmetry .",
    "in this study we extend these ideas to synthesize an optical bottle exhibiting all - inclusive circular symmetry , integrating forward - only propagating waves . to construct these waves",
    "we combine two concentric incomplete bessel beams by applying the concept of symmetrization in a notably dissimilar way of that discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for that purpose",
    "we follow a method previously shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that potentially is appropriate for using in a compact - sized system , which makes use of a non - planar meta - surface sustained by dispersion localities .",
    "our multilayered metal - dielectric nanostructure is piecewise periodic in the angular coordinate , thus enabling to transform a high - aperture focused beam into a mirror - symmetric accelerating beam nearly enclosing a circular region .",
    "our study is based on the efficient transformation of a converging wave field into a mirror - symmetric accelerating beam with a prescribed circular trajectory .",
    "such beam shaping is achieved by a meta - surface , which diffracts the impinging circular wavefront to be modulated appropriately . for that purpose ,",
    "let us consider the diffraction of a monochromatic converging wave by a diffracting optical element . in this paper , for the sake of clarity , we will consider two - dimensional waves propagating in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "however , a generalization in three dimensions may be carried out straightforwardly .",
    "the polarization of the incident focused field and the subsequently diffracted field will be transverse magnetic ( tm ) , in such a way that the magnetic field with time - domain frequency @xmath3 can be set as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the unitary vector pointing along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "in addition , this will be of help in order to excite surface plasmon resonances in the elementary nano - slits taking part of the designed meta - surface .     as evaluated from the debye diffraction eq .  .",
    "the emerging wave field propagates in the @xmath2 plane , and the meta - surface induces a wavefront deviation from its original shape ( reference cylinder ) by @xmath7 . a beam carrying a given acceleration leads to wave localization along an incomplete circumference with center at focus @xmath8 . ]",
    "according to the debye diffraction theory , the wave field in the focal region of the shaped converging beam can be obtained by means of the following diffraction integral @xcite @xmath9 } \\mathrm{d } \\theta , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the wave number , and @xmath12 is the magnetic field over the reference cylinder . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , @xmath13 is the radius of the diffracted cylindrical wave as taken over the reference cylinder .",
    "finally , @xmath14 is a unit vector pointing from the focus @xmath8 in the direction of a given point @xmath15 on the wavefront .",
    "the scattered wave field @xmath16 will be expressed by means of a real and positive term , @xmath17 , and a phase only term @xmath18 $ ] , giving @xmath19 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the apodization function @xmath17 takes into account the truncation and local attenuation of the converging field after passing through the diffracting optical element , and @xmath7 denotes any deviation of the diffracted wavefront from the reference cylinder , which commonly is interpreted as monochromatic aberration .",
    "the apodization function in our simulations is a super - gaussian function instead of a customary flat - top profile , which can be written as , @xmath20 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] of semi - aperture angle @xmath21 , enabling to minimize edge effects .",
    "we should mention that the limits of integration in eq .   including forward - only propagating waves",
    "makes the diffracted fields practically unaltered for semi - apertures @xmath22 and higher values .",
    "furthermore we will consider a linear phase modulation , which induces the acceleration of the diffracted field around the focal point @xmath8 @xcite . by neglecting a constant term of taylor expansion of @xmath7 , which has no significant contribution in the diffraction integral eq .  , and also neglecting higher orders of this expansion , we can rewrite the phase term in eq .   as @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the parameter @xmath24 governs the curvilinear trajectory of the focused field around the geometrical focus @xmath8 , as demonstrated below .",
    "particularly , the distance between the focal point @xmath8 and where the beam is localized , is determined by @xmath24 .",
    "it can be used for controlling the acceleration of a focused beam . before the diffraction broadening overcomes ,",
    "the beam propagates along a circular trajectory whose radius can be estimated as @xmath25 @xcite .    analytical solution of the debye integral eq .   can be achieved provided that @xmath26 and including backward propagating waves . by considering the parameter @xmath24 as an integer number , the magnetic field @xmath27 finally yields an expression that is proportional to the bessel function , namely @xmath28 , where @xmath29 @xcite . disregarding backward propagation",
    ", the resulting wave resembles a sector bessel field centered on the positive ( negative ) @xmath30 axis for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . because of that",
    ", this type of accelerating beams can be called as incomplete bessel beams @xcite .     corresponding to a bessel wave field of order @xmath33 propagating at @xmath34",
    ". accelerating wave field with ( b ) semi - aperture @xmath22 and @xmath35 , and ( c ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "( d ) schematics of the circular trajectory of an incomplete bessel field . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig02_1]a and ( b ) we show the intensity distribution @xmath38 of a bessel field of order @xmath33 and the associated incomplete bessel beam of semi - aperture @xmath22 . by changing the sign of the parameter @xmath24 , the acceleration is reversed however maintaining the center of curvature .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig02_1]c and [ fig02_1]d .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that increasing the absolute value of the order @xmath24 results in increasing the distance between localized accelerating fields and center of coordinates .",
    "and order @xmath33 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "again @xmath34 .",
    "an intereference pattern of the field intensity is evident along the @xmath40 axis . ]",
    "the coherent superposition of accelerating beams with bessel signatures may be used to create new beam shapes .",
    "for instance , by combining two incomplete bessel fields of the same order @xmath24 but opposite sign , we obtain a mirror - symmetric distribution of light , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig02_2 ] . in this case , the phase - only term @xmath41 shown in eq .   will be substituted by the real - valued periodic modulation @xmath42 .",
    "note that an intereference pattern may arise in the vicinities of the @xmath40 axis for high semi - apertures @xmath21 .",
    "the term @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) behaves like a phase term produced by a blazed grating obtaining a maximum diffraction efficiency at a distance @xmath44 from focal point .",
    "in fact , a focused beam , associated with an incomplete bessel wave field of order @xmath45 , can be transformed into an accelerating beam by a circular blazed grating .",
    "furthermore , a meta - surface periodically modulating the amplitude of a focused wave , instead of its phase distribution , will introduce a symmetrization of the accelerated field with respect to the @xmath40 axis .",
    "the latter represents the basis of our study .     and its influence in the debye diffraction integral : ( a ) schematic of the binary function and ( b ) resulting field intensity of the diffracted field by using such binary function for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]    here we consider the generation of mirror - symmetric accelerating beams by using diffracting meta - surfaces that shape a given impinging focused wave near its focus . for practical reasons ,",
    "the modulation of the converging wave will be carried out more efficiently in phase rather than in amplitude .",
    "therefore we conveniently binarize the cosine function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03]a .",
    "this transformation will not significantly modify the main contribution to the diffracted field , that is carried by the first diffraction order .",
    "however noisy sidelobes corresponding to high diffraction orders may appear . fig .",
    "[ fig03]b illustrates the resulting field intensity @xmath46 whose phase distribution is governed by the binary function of periodicity @xmath47 .",
    "note that the resultant intensity slightly deviates from that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02_2 ] .",
    "the period of the modulation is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 . ]    as a proof of concept , in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] we show some simple numerical experiments performed by means of a finite - element - analysis commercial software @xcite .",
    "a uniform surface current ( sc ) that is set at a given distance from the origin of coordinates will excite a wave field that focuses at @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04]a , where the applied wavelength is @xmath49 . by introducing a binary modulation of the surface current of angular period @xmath50 ,",
    "the emitted field propagates near the focus exhibiting a spatial acceleration and a mirror symmetry with respect to the optical axis .",
    "the surface current distribution is additionally apodized by the super - gaussian distribution @xmath17 ; we also show the response for a parameter @xmath48 at different semi - apertures : @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig04]b and @xmath22 in ( c ) .",
    "a periodic modulation of dephase @xmath52 produced in adjacent domains will produce a light capsule provided that the semi - aperture @xmath21 remains close to @xmath53 , that is in agreement with our analysis based on the debye diffraction integral .",
    "nevertheless , even in the optimal case of @xmath22 , the hollow beam is not fully closed due to the proximity of the surface current to the caustic curve .",
    "otherwise , increasing the radius of the surface current , the field distribution approaches that computed by eq .  .",
    "radians . for the sake of clarity",
    "we show the basic nanostructured arrangement in a planar geometry . ]    as shown above , combining two incomplete bessel beams with positive and negative acceleration parameter @xmath24 may be achieved by molding the cylindrical wavefront of a converging wave introducing a phase - only binarization .",
    "such beam shaping will be carried out by a properly - designed plasmonic meta - surface .",
    "a geometrical interpretation of the beam shaping using optical rays is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig05]a . in",
    "the simple yet efficient model followed previously , the meta - surface will be segmented into regions wherein individually we induce a nearly - flat phase response in transmission , in a way that additionally neighbouring domains exhibit a dephase of @xmath52 .    in order to generate our light capsule we propose a locally - distributed periodic metal - dielectric media .",
    "the manipulation of light , such as beam acceleration or focusing in free space , can be achieved by controlling surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) that are excited at the entrance surface of metallic slits and corrugations with a subwavelength size @xcite .",
    "for instance , using metallic slit arrays we may control phase retardation between adjacent slits @xcite",
    ". however , when these nano - slits are tightly arranged , plasmonic modes couple leading to a ( certainly limited ) degree of homogeneization of the wave fields @xcite . as a result , it can be used to induce a controlled phase delay .",
    "the dephase of wave passing through the grating is evaluated by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the propagation distance in the grating and @xmath56 is the complex propagation constant computed from dispersion relation of periodic metal - dielectric multilayers medium for tm - polarized waves which is achieved by the floquet - bloch theorem . considering a multilayered structure of period @xmath57 composed of a metal and a dielectric of permittivity @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , and using the transfer matrix formulation",
    "we finally obtain @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath62 , @xmath63 refers to either the metal or the dielectric , @xmath64 is the propagation constant in either the metal or the dielectric along the direction that is perpendicular to the metal - dielectric interface , @xmath65 denotes the width of each material layer , and @xmath66 is the bloch wave number . since , in the simulations is considered that the incident wave impinges normally to the metallic grating , eq .",
    "is solved for @xmath67 ( propagation all along the slits ) .",
    "specifically the metal was gold with @xmath68 @xcite at the wavelength of interest @xmath69 ; also the dielectric under consideration was air .    according to eq .",
    ", the dephase @xmath70 gained by a bloch mode is highly dependent on the width of the layers .",
    "therefore , the phase retardation which is required for beam shaping can be obtained by controlling variation of the width of metal slabs and the periodicity of the array .",
    "finally , an alternating sequence of two dissimilar multilayered metamaterials , displaced transversally to the direction of propagation of the incident field to produce a beam shaping , will give rise to the required binary phase distribution .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig05]b . in our design ,",
    "the width of metal is kept fixed , @xmath71 , however the grating periods are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the separation between the entrance plane and the exit plane , @xmath74 , that is the width of the meta - surface , remains below the wavelength . as a consequence ,",
    "the dephase @xmath75 induced by adjacent photonic crystals will yield @xmath52 radians .",
    "it should be noted that there is certain flexibility in order to attain the required phase distribution @xcite .",
    "next we will consider a subwavelength meta - surface in such a way that the metallic nanoelements are arranged over a circular sector .",
    "the effective length of the compound meta - surface , that is the part that will be illuminated by the cylindrical wave field , as measured on the exit surface , is equal to @xmath76 , where @xmath13 is the inner radius of the curvilinear nanostructure . in our numerical simulations @xmath77 and @xmath22 , and consequently the meta - surface has to include a minimum of @xmath78 bi - grating groups ( periods ) .",

    "[ fig07 ] shows some numerical simulations for different values of @xmath24 , illustrating the radial tuning of the optical bottle .",
    "in conclusion , we proposed a simple method to shape a high - aperture focused field , in the near field , into a nonparaxial accelerating field exhibiting mirror symmetry and that can be used as an optical capsule . through both wave and ray optics we showed how axi - symmetric circular caustics can result from a binary phase modulation .",
    "the resultant nonparaxial hollow fields show a bessel signature and have beam - widths near the diffraction limit . while these fields are two - dimensional , spherical light shells can be easily produced by using meta - surfaces modulating the wavefront in the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "also , the paths followed by the maxima will be circular due to the use of solutions separable in spherical coordinates .",
    "our procedure can also be used for producing 1d or 2d optical bottles with arbitrary convex caustics , which is governed by the shape of the diffacting meta - surface , thus providing a versatile tool for all kinds of accelerating waves .",
    "the engineered light capsules are easily sizable and exert forces that can be exploited to realize micrometer - size optical bottles that could attract microparticles or cells .",
    "the beam shaping proposed here is expected to offer certain advantages over the direct generation of accelerating beams using phase masks only , such as the ability to combine mechanical and optical traps produced in the vicinities of the focal region .",
    "potential applications also include light - induced curved plasma channels , self - bending electron beams , and accelerating plasmons .",
