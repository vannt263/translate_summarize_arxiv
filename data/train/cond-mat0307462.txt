    "in the field of strongly correlated electrons , lanthanide- or actinide - based heavy electron materials constitute a longstanding challenge to experimentalists and theorists alike [ 1,2 ] .",
    "the majority of such systems , heavy fermions , are of course metallic ; whether they be paramagnetic or ordered , fermi- or non - fermi liquids . among them however resides a class of materials with insulating ground states : the so - called kondo insulators , containing a large variety of compounds reviewed _ e.g.  _ in [ 3 - 7 ] , and well known examples including @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this mainly cubic class of paramagnetic systems exhibit narrow - gap insulating / semiconducting behaviour at low temperatures , while their ` high ' temperature behaviour is largely indistinguishable from metallic heavy fermions , amounting in essence to a lattice of @xmath8 ions that scatter conduction electrons independently via the kondo effect .",
    "the insulating gap has long been argued ( see _ e.g.  _ [ 3 ] ) to arise from hybridization between essentially localized @xmath8-levels and a broad conduction band , the essential physics involving a flat @xmath8-band crossing one conduction band such that there are exactly two electrons per unit cell ( ` half - filling ' ) ; albeit that the resultant hybridization gap is not of course a simple one - electron entity , being strongly renormalized by many - body interactions that reflect the localized and hence correlated nature of the @xmath8-levels . as such ,",
    "the kondo insulators provide [ 3 ] a realisation of the simplest , canonical model for understanding heavy electron systems [ 1,2 ] : the half - filled periodic anderson model ( pam ) , in which each lattice site contains a non - degenerate , correlated @xmath8-level hybridizing locally with a non - interacting conduction band , and which represents the natural lattice generalization of the single - impurity anderson model ( aim ) [ 2 ] .    in the present paper we consider the half - filled , symmetric pam within the powerful framework of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft , reviewed in [ 8 - 11 ] ) . formally exact in the large - dimensional limit",
    ", dmft provides a tangible approximation in finite dimensions , whereby electron dynamics become essentially local but remain wholly non - trivial [ 8 - 11 ] .",
    "our basic aims here are to provide a many - body description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic kondo insulators , specifically single - particle dynamics , dynamical conductivities and static electrical transport ; and to develop the theory to the point where quantitative comparison with experiment can be made .",
    "these goals are of course easier stated than achieved , and the pam has been studied extensively within dmft via a wide range of techniques .",
    "numerical methods include the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) [ 12,13 ] , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) [ 14 - 17 ] and exact diagonalization [ 18 ] ; while theoretical approaches include perturbation theory in the interaction strength [ 19,20 ] , iterated perturbation theory [ 21,22 ] , the lattice non - crossing approximation [ 23,24 ] and the simpler average @xmath9-matrix approximation [ 25 ] , large-@xmath10 mean - field theory [ 26,27 ] , and the gutzwiller approach [ 28,29 ] .",
    "nrg aside however , the above techniques suffer in general from well recognised limitations ; whether it be an inability to handle large interactions and hence recover the exponentially small scales that are the hallmark of strongly correlated systems , failure to recover fermi liquid behaviour at low - energies , unrealistic confinement to the lowest energies , and so on .",
    "within dmft all correlated lattice - fermion models reduce to an effective quantum impurity hybridizing self - consistently with the surrounding fermionic bath [ 8 - 11 ] , _",
    "i.e.  _ to an effective , self - consistent aim . techniques for the latter thus underpin the former .",
    "motivated in part by this we have been developing a ` local moment approach ' ( lma ) to quantum impurity models ( aims ) [ 30 - 35 ] , the main emphasis of which is on dynamics and transport .",
    "intrinsically non - perturbative and able to capture the spin - fluctuation physics characteristic of the strongly correlated kondo regime , the lma encompasses all interaction strengths @xmath11 and recovers simple perturbative behaviour in weak coupling [ 30 ] .",
    "dynamics on all energy scales are handled , and the low - energy dictates of fermi liquid behaviour satisfied ( although the approach is not confined to fermi liquid ground states , see _",
    "e.g.  _ [ 33,34 ] ) .",
    "results for dynamics arising from the lma have been shown [ 30 - 32,34 ] to give very good agreement with nrg calculations ; and , for static magnetic properties , with exact results from the bethe ansatz [ 35 ] .    in a recent paper [ 36 ]",
    "we have further developed the local moment approach to encompass @xmath12 single - particle dynamics / spectra of the symmetric pam . while plain perturbative behaviour is again recovered in weak coupling , the natural focus of [ 36 ] was on the strong coupling ( _ i.e .  _",
    "large-@xmath11 ) kondo lattice regime . at sufficiently low energies in the vicinity of the fermi level",
    ", the lma recovers correctly the ` insulating fermi liquid ' behaviour [ 36 ] that reflects adiabatic continuity in @xmath11 to the non - interacting limit of the simple hybridization - gap insulator [ 2,10 ] .",
    "this is manifest in preservation of the single - particle gap , now characterised by a renormalized gap scale @xmath13 which is reduced from its non - interacting counterpart by the quasiparticle weight @xmath14 that embodies many - body interactions . in agreement with consensus",
    "[ 12 - 15,24,28,29 ] , strong coupling dynamics were found [ 36 ] to be characterized by the _ single low - energy gap scale @xmath13 ; which is exponentially small in strong coupling [ 36 ] ( reflecting its dependence on @xmath14 ) , thus leading to a clear separation between low- and high - energy scales . in consequence , ` low'-@xmath1 dynamics exhibit scaling : being dependent solely and universally upon @xmath15 , with _ no dependence on the ` bare ' high - energy parameters ( @xmath11 etc ) that enter the pam hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest manifestation of scaling is that at sufficiently low energies @xmath15 the spectral behaviour amounts [ 2,10 ] to a quasiparticle renormalization of the non - interacting hybridization - gap insulator ; which is of course the justification for renormalized band structure ideas . by itself",
    "however such quasiparticle behaviour gives rather a crude caricature of the scaling spectra , for it is confined to the immediate vicinity of the fermi level @xmath16 [ 36 ] ; beyond which and on scales on the order of @xmath13 itself , non - trivial dynamics rapidly sets in , embodied in long , slowly varying spectral tails that reflect genuine many - body scattering / lifetime effects .",
    "as we show in the present paper , it is in fact this that dominates both dynamics and transport properties for _ all _ temperatures . _ _    the paper is organised as follows . the model and basic underlying theory is discussed in  2 ; formulated for an arbitrary host lattice , and including relevant aspects of the lma in general (  2.1 ) as well as the specific class of diagrams contributing to the associated dynamical self - energies @xmath17 that we employ here in practice .  3 deals briefly with some basic formal results for conduction electron scattering rates , electrical transport and optical conductivities . here and",
    "thereafter we consider explicitly and together two canonical host lattices [ 8 - 11 ] , the hypercubic and bethe lattices ; our aim throughout being to emphasise both the differences and , more importantly , similarities between these two representative cases .",
    "results arising from the lma are then presented systematically in ",
    "our primary emphasis is again the strong coupling kondo lattice regime of the pam , this being both where the theoretical difficulties lie and the regime generally applicable to small - gap kondo insulators . by the same token we focus largely , albeit not exclusively , on the scaling behaviour of dynamics and/or transport , now depending universally on @xmath18 _ and @xmath19",
    "this is important for many reasons , not least because the lack of scale separation inherent to some previous approaches has we believe led to a number of misconceptions in the literature , particularly in regard to the scales relevant to the @xmath2- and @xmath1-dependence of the conductivity . in ",
    "s 4,5 , and considering _ all @xmath20 and @xmath21 scales , single - particle dynamics , conduction electron scattering rates and d.c .",
    "transport are considered ; including explicit connection to single impurity physics at high frequencies and/or temperatures ( ` kondo logs ' etc ) .",
    "optical conductivities @xmath22 are considered in  6 , with particular emphasis given to the nature of the optical gap and the clear separation between indirect and direct gap scales in both the @xmath1-dependence and thermal evolution of @xmath22 . _",
    "_    in  7 we turn to experiment , considering three prototypical materials for which extensive and reliable data is available [ 3 - 7 ] , _ viz _ @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; our aim being direct comparison between the present theory and experimental results for both d.c . transport and optical conductivities .",
    "that may be achieved in a minimalist fashion , employing directly the scaling behaviour discussed in ",
    "s 4 - 6 ; which requires neither multiparameter fits nor in general a specification of the bare model parameters .",
    "good agreement between theory and experiment is found , even quantitatively ; with many of the characteristic features arising theoretically being directly apparent in experiment , and a mutually consistent description of transport and optics thereby arising .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief summary .",
    "in standard notation , the hamiltonian for the pam is given by :    = -t_(i , j ) , c^_i c^_j + _ i , ( _ f + f^_i - f^_i- ) f^_if^_i + v_i , ( f^_i c^_i + ) [ eq : model ] the first term describes the uncorrelated conduction(@xmath23 ) band with nearest neighbour hopping @xmath24 , rescaled as @xmath25 in the large dimensional limit where the coordination number @xmath26 [ 8 - 11 ] ( with @xmath27 the basic unit of energy ) .",
    "the second term refers to the @xmath8-levels with site energies @xmath28 and on - site repulsion @xmath11 ; such that @xmath29 for the particle - hole ( p - h ) symmetric pam considered here , for which @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( for all @xmath11 ) as appropriate to the kondo insulating state .",
    "the final term in equation describes @xmath32-level hybridization via the local matrix element @xmath33 , whence the model is characterized by two independent dimensionless parameters , _ viz _ @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "our natural focus is on local single - particle dynamics , embodied in the retarded green functions @xmath36 and likewise @xmath37 for the @xmath23-levels , with corresponding local spectra @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 or @xmath8 ) .",
    "a knowledge of local dynamics and their thermal evolution is in turn sufficient within dmft [ 8 - 11 ] to determine optical and transport properties , as detailed in @xmath40[sec : transp ] .",
    "we begin with some brief remarks on the trivial limit @xmath41 , where ( equation ) the @xmath8-levels decouple from the free conduction band .",
    "the latter is specified by its local density of states @xmath42 , and it proves useful in the following to denote by @xmath43 the hilbert transform ( z)=^_- d [ eq : ht ] for arbitrary complex @xmath44 .",
    "the free @xmath23-electron ( local ) propagator @xmath45 is itself given simply by g_0()&= & ( ^+ ) + & = & ^-1 [ eq : s0def ] with @xmath46 here and throughout ; where ( as used below ) equation defines the feenberg self - energy @xmath47 [ 37,38 ] , with @xmath48 $ ] a functional of @xmath49 ( since @xmath50 ) .",
    "while our subsequent discussion holds for an arbitrary conduction band @xmath51 , specific results will be given in @xmath40 s 4_ff _ for the bethe lattice ( bl ) and hypercubic lattice ( hcl ) ; for which within dmft the @xmath51 are respectively a semi - ellipse and an unbounded gaussian , given explicitly by [ 8 - 11 ] : _ 0()= ^ : || t _ * [ eq : r0bl ] + _ 0()= ( -[/t_*]^2 ) [ eq : r0hc ]    as noted in @xmath40[sec : intro ] we are interested in the homogeneous paramagnetic phase of the pam , for which the @xmath52 are site - independent .",
    "the major simplifying feature of dmft is that the @xmath8-electron self - energy is site - diagonal [ 8 - 11 ] , and from straightforward application of feenberg renormalized perturbation theory [ 37,38 ] the @xmath53 are given by : g^c()&= & ^-1 [ eq : gc ] + g^f()&= & ^-1 [ eq : gf ] here @xmath54 is the conventional single self - energy ( defined to exclude the trivial hartree contribution which identically cancels @xmath29 ) , such that @xmath55 with @xmath56 for all @xmath57 ; and with p - h symmetry reflected in _",

    "specifically , the feenberg self - energy @xmath63 $ ] is precisely the same functional of @xmath64 as it is of @xmath45 in the @xmath41 limit ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xmath65 for the bl ) . in consequence",
    ", @xmath66 is given using equation by g^c()= ( ) [ eq : gchg ] where ( ) = ^+ - [ eq : gamma ] ( and we add in passing that in physical terms @xmath67 gives the conduction electron scattering rate which will be considered further in @xmath40[sec : transp ] ) .",
    "it is this that , for an arbitrary @xmath51 , prescribes the conventional ` single self - energy ' route to the propagators @xmath53 : given @xmath54 , and hence @xmath68 , @xmath69 follows directly by hilbert transformation ; @xmath62 follows ( from equation ) as s()=- [ eq : som ] and @xmath70 then follows in turn from equation . in practice of course the problem must be solved iteratively and self - consistently , because the approximate @xmath71 employed will itself in general be a functional of self - consistently determined propagators .",
    "self - consistent second order perturbation theory in @xmath11 [ 20 ] provides a direct example ; as too does iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) [ 21 ] where @xmath71 is constructed from the second order ( in @xmath11 ) skeleton diagram , employing host / medium @xmath8-electron propagators @xmath72^{-1}$ ] given from equation by ( ) = ^-1 [ eq : hostg ] and thus dependent on @xmath62 itself .",
    "results arising from ipt will be discussed in @xmath40 s 4 - 6 .      in the conventional route to dynamics sketched above ,",
    "the success of any particular theory is naturally determined by the approximation employed for the single self - energy @xmath73 .",
    "therein lie well known difficulties [ 2 ] , notably the inability of conventional perturbation theory to handle strong interactions in general , and to recover exponentially small scales that are the hallmark of strongly correlated behaviour ; together with the divergences that plague perturbation theory in @xmath11 [ 2 ] if one attempts to perform essentially standard diagrammatic resummations ( _ e.g .",
    "_ rpa ) of the sort one intuitively expects should be required to capture the regime of strong electron correlations . for these reasons the lma [ 30 - 36 ] eschews an approach based directly on the single @xmath73 , and focuses instead on a two - self - energy description that is a natural consequence of the mean - field approach from which it starts",
    "there are three essential elements to the lma .",
    "( i ) first that @xmath8-electron local moments ( ` @xmath74 ' ) , viewed as the initial effect of interactions , are introduced explicitly from the outset .",

    "i.e _ unrestricted hartree - fock ) ; containing two degenerate , local symmetry broken mf states , corresponding to @xmath75 .",
    "grossly deficient by itself ( see [ 36 ] ) , mf nevertheless provides a starting point for a non - perturbative many - body approach , to which end ( ii ) the lma employs the two - self - energy description that is a natural consequence of the underlying two local saddle points .",
    "the associated self - energies are built diagrammatically from the underlying mf propagators , and include in particular a non - perturbative class of diagrams ( @xmath40[sec : se ] and below ) that capture the spin - flip dynamics essential to describe the strongly correlated regime .",
    "( iii ) the final key idea behind the lma at @xmath12 is that of symmetry restoration [ 30 - 36 ] : self - consistent restoration of the broken symmetry endemic at pure mf level , and hence recovery on the lowest energy scales of the fermi liquid / quasiparticle behaviour that reflects adiabatic continuity in @xmath11 to the non - interacting limit .    as detailed in [ 36 ]",

    "the high - frequency behaviour of the impurity single - particle scaling spectrum @xmath292 for the aim has only recently been uncovered , using the lma [ 31 ] ( which gives excellent agreement with nrg results [ 34 ] for that problem ) .",

    "first let us consider the important differences between the hypercubic and bethe lattices ; which in turn reveals equally important similarities between the two . from figure 10",
    "it appears that with increasing @xmath21 , @xmath320 is growing apparently unboundedly , albeit relatively slowly ; while @xmath333 is slowly saturating to a constant value @xmath334 .",
    "this is indeed the case , and stems from the fact that in the limit of vanishing hybridization @xmath41  where the @xmath8-levels decouple from the conduction band  the bl has a non - zero residual ( @xmath12 ) conductivity / resistivity ( in contrast of course to _ any @xmath335 , for which the @xmath12 conductivity vanishes ) ; specifically , as follows straightforwardly using equation ( 3.7b ) , that : @xmath336^{2 } = \\frac{4}{\\pi^{2}}\\ ] ] it is this , the residual conductivity of the free ( @xmath41 ) conduction band , that corresponds to the ultimate high-@xmath21 constant asymptote seen in the inset to figure 10 for the bl ( @xmath337 , marked by an arrow in the figure ) .",
    "this is further evident if one considers the temperature dependence of @xmath333 on ` all scales ' , _",

    ". here the @xmath338-dependence of @xmath340 is also shown , and is seen to constitute an upper bound to the @xmath338-dependence of @xmath333 itself .",
    "since the gap @xmath13 is exponentially small in strong coupling , the scaling behaviour of @xmath333 illustrated in figure 10 for finite @xmath232 corresponds in figure 11 to exponentially small values of @xmath341 ; whence as seen from figure 11 , @xmath333 is bounded above by @xmath342 for large-@xmath21 in the scaling regime ( which corresponds formally to any finite @xmath21 in the limit @xmath343 ) . _",
    "the latter behaviour is readily understood in physical terms , since in the scaling regime the gap in the conduction band @xmath344 rapidly fills in with increasing @xmath21 and approaches the free @xmath41 conduction band ( see _ e.g.  _ figures 4b,5b ) . for @xmath265",
    "the gap @xmath13 is thus in essence irrelevant , _",
    "i.e.  _ might as well be zero  which is of course just the @xmath41 limit , with its characteristic residual resistivity for the bl .",
    "for the hcl by contrast the residual resistivity for @xmath41 is precisely zero ; reflecting the infinite conductivity associated with the coherent bloch states that in this case arise when @xmath41 .",
    "so for the hcl by the same reasoning , one does not therefore expect the conductivity _ in the scaling regime to saturate for @xmath265 , as indeed evident in figure 10 ( see also figure 11 ( inset ) where the @xmath338-dependence of @xmath320 is shown for a sequence of increasing @xmath339 , as well as figure 12 below ) .",
    "we believe this conclusion to be rather general : if for whatever reason the free ( @xmath41 ) conduction band is characterised by a non - vanishing residual conductivity / resistivity , be it due _",
    "e.g.  _ to the intrinsic nature of the free conduction band or to the presence of disorder , then we expect the conductivity in the scaling regime to approach asymptotically this limiting value for @xmath265 .",
    "_    to take the above into account when comparing the two lattices it is natural to subtract from the resistivity any finite high-@xmath21 asymptote , as embodied in @xmath345 ( a redundant operation for the hcl where @xmath346 ) ; considering therefore  in obvious parallel to the aim  the ` change in resistivity due to coupling the @xmath8-levels to the host conduction band ' .",
    "specifically , for the bl we consider below the following dimensionless resistivity : @xmath347    we have just highlighted the differences between the hcl and bl .",

    "two immediate features are apparent . first that the high-@xmath21 asymptotics of the @xmath351 s coincide ( whence re figure 10 , the rate at which the bl conductivity @xmath333 asymptotically approaches its saturation value is the same as that with which its hcl counterpart grows unboundedly ) ; the leading asymptotics is obtained explicitly below .",
    "in fact for @xmath353 or so , the behaviour of the two lattices is barely distinguishable .",
    "second , cursory inspection of figure 12 might suggest that the resistivities @xmath351 are themselves plateauing with increasing @xmath21 , since they change only slightly over a large temperature range out to many multiples of the gap .",
    "this interpretation , while rather natural at first sight , is not correct since the @xmath354 as @xmath355 .",

    "the ipt calculations were performed for @xmath305 and @xmath377 ( as employed for the bl in  4.1 ) ; and the inability of ipt to recover an exponentially small gap scale means that non - universal temperatures on the order of @xmath378 are reached by @xmath379 .",

    "this is surprising , since ipt is qualitatively correct in predicting a @xmath12 gap in the single - particle spectra @xmath380 [ 21,10 ] ; we have thus examined the problem in some detail .",
    "its physical origins stem from the fact that the imaginary part of the ipt @xmath12 self - energy , @xmath381 , is zero for @xmath382 rather than for @xmath383 as one might expect ( where ` zero ' strictly means exponentially small for the hcl with its soft - gap , although that is irrelevant in the following ) ; and in consequence the scattering rate @xmath384 ( see equation ( 3.4 ) ) likewise vanishes for @xmath385 .",
    "but for @xmath386 , there is a high density of conduction electron states embodied in @xmath344 ( see _ e.g.  _ figures 2 or 4 ) .",

    "while strictly an issue at @xmath12 since all gaps are technically destroyed for @xmath155 , this of course has major ramifications for both the frequency and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity .",
    "we note at the outset that our most basic conclusion here differs qualitatively from the work of [ 21,15 ] .",
    "it has been argued hitherto ( see _ e.g.  _ figure 2 of [ 21 ] ) that the optical gap in @xmath397 corresponds to the minimum _ direct gap @xmath398 of the renormalized band structure , as opposed to the _ indirect gap @xmath399 that is manifest in the single - particle spectra @xmath344 or @xmath400 ; a conclusion that in turn underpins the interpretation of experiment given in [ 21 ] ( see also [ 6 ] ) .",
    "we do not believe this to be correct on general grounds , neither do we find it supported by the present theory .",
    "by contrast we show , in agreement with the qualitative conclusions of [ 7 ] , that : ( i ) the optical gap corresponds to the indirect gap ( albeit that the direct gap scale is obviously also manifest in the @xmath1-dependence of the optical conductivity ) ; and ( ii ) that it is the indirect gap which sets the temperature scale for the thermal evolution of the optical conductivity in the kondo lattice regime , in particular the ` filling ' of the optical gap with increasing temperature ( which we regard as entirely natural , since in strong coupling @xmath13 is the characteristic low - energy scale of the system ) .",
    "_ _    it is first necessary to explain why we disagree in particular with the conclusions of [ 21 ] . as discussed in  2.1 ( see also [ 2,10,36 ] ) the limiting low - frequency behaviour of the single - particle green functions amounts to a renormalization of the non - interacting limit ; arising from the exact equations ( 2.5 ) by neglecting the imaginary part of the @xmath8-electron self - energy @xmath381 and replacing ( @xmath401 ) @xmath402 by its leading low-@xmath1 behaviour , _ viz _ @xmath403 with @xmath14 the quasiparticle weight .",
    "this leads directly to the quasiparticle behaviour embodied in equations ( 2.20 ) , _",
    "e.g.  _ @xmath404 with @xmath405 referring to the @xmath108 limit ; whence the lowest-@xmath1 behaviour of @xmath344 ( and likewise @xmath400 ) is a simple quasiparticle renormalization of the non - interacting limit , with @xmath406 . in particular (  2.1 ) the gap in the single - particle spectra is generically preserved .",
    "this is the indirect gap scale defined by , @xmath407 which is indeed manifest in the single - particle spectra ( the 2 simply reflecting the ` full ' gap , as opposed to that measured from the fermi level at mid - gap , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the quasiparticle form for the single - particle propagators is not approximate : it must be satisfied asymptotically at sufficiently low frequencies , reflecting as it does fermi liquid behaviour in the sense of adiabatic continuity to the non - interacting limit ; and indeed it is , as illustrated in figure 2 ( see also [ 36 ] ) .",
    "we emphasise however that this quasiparticle behaviour is confined to the lowest frequency scales @xmath408 , up to at most a few times the ( indirect ) gap @xmath409 ; beyond which , as detailed in  4 and [ 36 ] , this simple picture no longer holds .",
    "the arguments above may be extended  but with a wholly different validity  to the optical conductivity ; it is this that underlies the conclusion of [ 21 ] . from equations ( 3.7 ) , the optical conductivities are determined by the @xmath410 ; where (  3 ) @xmath411^{-1}$ ] with @xmath412^{-1}$ ] .",
    "if the asymptotic form equation ( 6.1 ) for @xmath413 is again employed here , then @xmath414 and hence @xmath415^{-1}$ ] which again amounts to a renormalization of the non - interacting limit .",
    "the two branches characteristic of this renormalized band structure then follow from the zeros of the approximate @xmath416^{-1}$ ] ; being given by @xmath417 $ ] , with the @xmath418-dependent gap function @xmath419 .",
    "the minimum such gap occurs for @xmath420 ; this is the ( approximate ) direct gap , @xmath421 ( which we add in passing is radically different from the indirect gap equation ( 6.2 ) in strong coupling where @xmath245 , since @xmath422 ) .",
    "if now one interprets the optical conductivity of the hypercubic lattice ( given from equation ( 3.7a ) ) in terms of a naive picture of renormalized interband transitions , then since @xmath398 above corresponds to the minimum energy for such , one would clearly expect it to vanish for @xmath423 ; concluding [ 21 ] therefore that the optical gap coincides with the direct gap , while the indirect gap is by contrast manifest only in the single - particle spectra , see _ e.g.  _ figure 2 of [ 21 ] . and",
    "indeed , if the above approximation @xmath424^{-1}$ ] is used explicitly in equation ( 3.7a ) , one finds directly that @xmath425 for all @xmath426 ( and in fact likewise for @xmath427 at any @xmath2 ) .",
    "the above argument is certainly correct for the _ non - interacting limit of the pam , which is characterised strictly by simple one - electron states . despite its superficial appeal however , it is incorrect beyond the confines of this limit : for it neglects completely [ 7 ] the effects of scattering arising from electron interactions , as embodied in the scattering rates @xmath428 ( equation ( 3.3 ) ) considered explicitly in  4.1 ; or equivalently ( see equation ( 3.4 ) ) in the imaginary part of the @xmath8-electron self - energy @xmath429 , which also controls the single - particle dynamics (  2,4 ) .",
    "the effect of this many - body scattering on the optical conductivity may be inferred from equation ( 3.7a ) , from which it is straightforward to prove that if @xmath381 is non - zero for @xmath430 , then @xmath431 is non - zero for @xmath432 .",
    "but the scale @xmath433 above which @xmath381 effectively ( hcl ) becomes non - zero is of course the single - particle gap scale @xmath13 , whence ( equation ( 6.2 ) ) the optical gap corresponds to the _ indirect gap @xmath434 .",
    "four further points should be noted here .",
    "( a ) we emphasize that this qualitative conclusion is not dependent on the lma , although the latter indeed gives @xmath435 .",
    "in fact it arises also within ipt for which , as discussed in  5 , @xmath413 is non - vanishing for @xmath436 ( the central point again being that @xmath437 ) .",
    "( b ) the above conclusion is certainly consistent (  5 ) with a transport gap ( equation ( 5.1 ) ) @xmath438 in the static conductivity : the latter is simply the @xmath16 limit of the optical conductivity , and at the very least it is natural to expect the optical gap to be proportional to the low - temperature gap scale for static transport .",
    "( c ) recall that the scaling regime characteristic of the strong coupling kondo lattice ( where the quasiparticle weight @xmath439 ) corresponds to any finite @xmath18 in the formal limit @xmath440 .",
    "but if the optical gap corresponded to the direct gap equation ( 6.3 ) , this would require @xmath441 for all @xmath442 .",
    "since such a frequency range clearly encompasses ( and goes well beyond ) the @xmath20-scaling regime , this would entail _ vanishing scattering rates throughout the scaling regime ; which is physically untenable .",
    "( d ) our discussion of the optical gap has in large part focussed implicitly on @xmath431 for the hypercubic lattice .",
    "but the same conclusion arises ( essentially trivially ) for the bethe lattice @xmath443 : from equation ( 3.7b ) @xmath444 where , since (  4 ) the conduction electron spectrum has a gap @xmath13 ( measured from the fermi level ) , the optical gap follows immediately as @xmath445 .",
    "this suggests in addition that we should expect the optical properties of the hcl and bl to be qualitatively similar , at least for sufficiently low frequencies and/or temperatures .",
    "that is indeed the case , as we show below .",
    "_ _ _    figure 14 shows the resultant lma optical conductivities @xmath312 ( equations ( 3.7 ) ) for both the bl and hcl , as a function of @xmath446 and for a range of temperatures @xmath232 .",
    "these are the universal forms , scaling in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 with no dependence on bare material parameters [ and by way of orientation we add that for gaps @xmath13 in the range @xmath447 , @xmath448 would correspond to frequencies @xmath1 in the range @xmath449 .",
    "the indirect gap @xmath434 ( @xmath450 ) is marked on the figures and is indeed seen to be the ( @xmath12 ) optical gap .",
    "the @xmath12 optical conductivity is ` sharper ' in an obvious sense for the bl than the hcl , but in either case it is again the indirect gap that sets the scale for thermal destruction of the gap : by @xmath451 or so , the gap is well filled in and the optical conductivity essentially constant over the @xmath20-range shown .",
    "these are of course characteristic features of experimental kondo insulators [ 3 - 7 ] , as discussed for specific materials in  7 . here",
    "we simply add that @xmath312 s on the order of @xmath452 lead to absolute conductivities @xmath453 in the range @xmath454 ( taking a typical @xmath321 (  3 ) of @xmath455 ) ; values that are typical for kondo insulators around room temperature [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "figure 14 also shows that on initially increasing @xmath21 from @xmath456 , the optical conductivity acquires a drude - like peak centred on @xmath16 , which broadens with increasing @xmath21 and is subsequently destroyed as the gap is filled in ; as also seen in a qmc study of the hcl [ 15 ] ( discussed further below ) .",
    "this is more clearly evident in figure 15 , where the thermal evolution of the drude peak for the hcl is shown for @xmath457 and @xmath458 .",

    "two features are immediately apparent in figure 16 .",
    "first , unsurprisingly , that the optical conductivity is large on frequency scales on the order of the direct gap ; particularly for the hcl where , as expected physically and known from previous work [ 15,21 ] , @xmath427 is strongly peaked around @xmath471 .",
    "the second point concerns the thermal evolution of the optical conductivity .",
    "the @xmath313 range shown in figure 16 corresponds to temperatures up to 5 times the _ indirect gap @xmath472 ; over which range , as shown in figure 14 , the optical gap ` fills in ' .",
    "as seen from figure 16 however , temperatures of this order have essentially no effect on the optical conductivity at frequency scales on the order of the direct gap @xmath473 , which for all practical purposes retain their @xmath12 values .",
    "this is not surprising , for one should expect the optical conductivity on frequency scales @xmath471 to be thermally eroded only on temperature scales of the same order .",
    "this is indeed the case , as illustrated in figure 17 which ( for the same bare parameters ) shows the thermal evolution of @xmath427 up to temperatures @xmath474 ( _ i.e .  _",
    "@xmath475 ) : significant thermal erosion on the direct gap scale sets by around @xmath476 , and is well established at the highest temperature shown in the figure . _    it is clear from the above that the indirect and direct gap frequency scales , each determined by but with their different dependences upon the quasiparticle weight @xmath14 ( equations ( 6.2,3 ) ) , are qualitatively distinct in the strong coupling kondo lattice regime where @xmath245 ; as too in consequence are the corresponding temperatures for which dynamics on these respective scales evolve . but this ` clean ' separation of scales will not of course be evident in the @xmath477-dependences of the optical conductivity if one is _ e.g.  _ restricted technique - wise either to low interaction strengths ( where @xmath478 ) or to high temperatures .",
    "this is the case with quantum monte carlo , and is we believe the reason why the above scale separation is not apparent in the qmc work of [ 15 ] .",
    "this lack of scale separation is also intrinsic to ipt [ 21 ] , since its resultant quasiparticle weight decays algebraically rather than exponentially in the interaction strength .",
    "numerical renormalization group calculations [ 12,13 ] by contrast are not constrained in the above sense , although nrg calculations of finite-@xmath2 dynamics and transport properties of the pam have not to our knowledge been performed thus far .",
    "experimentally , kondo insulators have been widely studied via an impressive range of techniques ( for reviews see _ e.g.  _ [ 3 - 7 ] ) . here",
    "we consider briefly three prototypical materials among those for which the most extensive and reliable data is available , _ viz _ @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "our aim here is simple : to compare the present theory directly to experimental results for d.c .  transport and optical conductivities .",
    "we also emphasise that subsequent comparison to experiment does _ not involve multi - parameter fits , or a detailed knowledge of the bare material parameters ; and in these terms is minimalist .",
    "the essential point of scaling , as detailed in the preceding sections , is that in strong coupling the temperature dependence of transport / optics is encoded in @xmath232 alone , independently of the bare model parameters .",
    "the gap @xmath13 ( @xmath479 ) may thus itself be obtained from experiment ( as below ) ; given which , the theory then predicts the full @xmath2-dependence .",
    "the same comment applies to the @xmath1-dependence of the optical conductivity , which in the scaling regime depends only on @xmath18 ( albeit of course that ` non - universal ' @xmath480 s (  6 ) are also accessed experimentally ) .",
    "all this is naturally based on the assumption that the experimental materials are indeed strongly correlated , which we take for granted unless there appear to be experimental hints to the contrary ( as we suggest below may be the case for @xmath5 ) .",

    "one must of course choose whether to compare experiment to theoretical results arising from the hcl or bl , the two host lattices we have considered explicitly . here",

    "these are compared to results arising for @xmath291 ( @xmath485 ) from the present theory for the bl , taking @xmath486 .",
    "the transport gap ( equation ( 5.1 ) ) inferred experimentally is @xmath487 [ 48 ] , from which (  5 ) @xmath488 follows .    the quantitative agreement between experiment and theory is clear from figure 18 , being excellent for @xmath489 or so , as seen in particular from the d.c .",
    "conductivity shown directly in the inset .",
    "the agreement extends up to @xmath490 or @xmath491 , an appreciable multiple of the gap where ( see _ e.g.  _ figure 10 ) the high - temperature logarithmic asymptotics of the kondo regime are being approached ; so that the temperature range shown spans essentially the full range of expected physical behaviour .",
    "the activated insulating nature of the low-@xmath2 transport ( equation ( 5.1 ) ) is likewise evident in the figure , although transport in @xmath3 at the lowest temperatures is dominated by variable range hopping between extrinsic states in the gap [ 48 ] which the theory does not of course seek to include .    as discussed in  6 , the d.c .",
    "transport and optics should be consistent in the sense that the ( @xmath12 ) gap in the optical conductivity should correspond to the indirect gap , @xmath445 ; and the thermal evolution of the optical conductivity should likewise be controlled by the indirect gap scale . taking @xmath492 from the d.c .",
    "experiments as above , figure 19 ( top panel ) shows the theoretical optical conductivity @xmath493 _ vs @xmath1 up to @xmath494 , for temperatures @xmath495 and @xmath496 ( each curve thus corresponding to a particular ` realisation ' of the universal bl optical conductivities shown in figure 10 ) .",
    "the lower panel in figure 19 shows corresponding experimental results [ 49 ] for @xmath497 , obtained from kramers - kronig transformation of reflectivity measurements ; we have also indicated the indirect gap on the @xmath1-axis , and have marked experimental values of the d.c .",

    "the relevant temperature scale indeed appears to be the indirect gap [ 7,50 ] : as noted in [ 49 ] , for @xmath2 between @xmath498 and @xmath496 the optical gap is well filled in and the optical conductivity nearly constant in the far infrared ; and the gap begins to develop markedly only below @xmath499 ( which we add is naturally consistent with thermal evolution of the single - particle dynamics , see _",
    "e.g.  _ figure 4 ) .",

    "conductivities are larger than their a.c .",
    "counterparts at the lowest @xmath500 , the difference diminishing with increasing @xmath2 and being barely perceptible by @xmath501 .",
    "this we believe to be symptomatic of the low-@xmath1 drude - like peak discussed in  6 ( figures 14,15 ) that lies below the detection limit of @xmath502 but is apparent ( albeit weakly ) in the theoretical @xmath503 ; and further evidence for which arises in the systems discussed below ( see figures 21,23 ) . finally , a remark on the optical gap itself . as noted in [ 49 ] , linear extrapolation to zero of the steep part of the experimental @xmath504 would suggest a gap value on the order of @xmath505 .",
    "this is certainly consistent with @xmath506 , inferred as above from d.c .",
    "transport . on the other hand",
    "a charge gap @xmath507 has been identified in [ 49 ] , for natural reasons evident in the experimental data shown in figure 19 ( and with @xmath508 indicated on both panels in figure 19 ) .",
    "our point here is simply that @xmath434 and @xmath508 are fundamentally equivalent scales ( each being proportional to the quasiparticle weight @xmath14 ) .",
    "the former is ` correct ' insofar as the optical gap is strictly a @xmath12 notion ; while the latter is natural if one wishes instead to focus on the incipient development of a gap coming from the ` high'-temperature regime @xmath509 .",
    "samarium hexaboride provides another long studied [ 51 ] , prime example of a kondo insulator .",
    "here we refer to a recent comprehensive study [ 52 ] of both static transport and low - energy electrodynamics , performed on a high quality single crystal sample ; with the optical conductivity obtained directly via sub - millimeter spectroscopy in the frequency range @xmath511 [ 52 ] , and by kramers - kronig analysis of reflectivity in the infrared [ 52,53 ] .",
    "we restrict our considerations mainly to temperatures @xmath512 , since for lower temperatures variable range hopping again arises .",
    "experimental results for the resistivity @xmath484 [ 52 ] , spanning five orders of magnitude , are shown in figure 20 ; and compared to theoretical results for the hypercubic lattice ( as one might anticipate to be appropriate for a clean sample ) , taking @xmath513 and @xmath514 . between @xmath515 and @xmath516 the experimental d.c .",
    "conductivity / resistivity has the activated form equation ( 5.1 ) , with a transport gap @xmath517 @xmath518 ) [ 52 ] .",

    "the main figure shows @xmath484 on a log - scale _ vs @xmath2 ; while the insets show the corresponding d.c .",
    "conductivity _ vs both @xmath522 ( to exemplify in particular the activated regime ) and temperature on a log - scale .",
    "the agreement between theory / experiment for @xmath512 is rather striking ; for @xmath523 the experimental variable range hopping behaviour is of course evident from the right inset to the figure . _ _    the consequent optical conductivity @xmath503 for the hcl is shown _",
    "vs @xmath1 in figure 21 ( top panel ) on a log - log scale , for temperatures @xmath524 and @xmath496 .",
    "corresponding experimental results for the same temperatures [ 52 ] are shown in the lower panel , including the extrapolated conductivities ( dashed lines ) obtained from the phenomenological fit to the data employed in [ 52 ] .",
    "the @xmath1-range shown , up to @xmath525 , naturally encompasses non - universal scales at high - frequencies , and the calculations were performed specifically for @xmath526 and @xmath460 .",
    "the system is however strongly correlated for these parameters , so we emphasise that the resultant ` low'-@xmath1 conductivity ( up to @xmath527 or so in practice ) lies in the @xmath18 scaling regime that is actually independent of the bare parameters (  s 4 - 6 ) : the choice of bare parameters ` matters ' only at the high frequency end , and we have simply chosen those above as illustrative .",
    "we would however add that for the chosen parameters the quasiparticle weight @xmath528 , which is in qualitative accord with the experimentally inferred effective mass ( @xmath529 ) @xmath530 ( from [ 52 ] ) and @xmath531 from a previous study [ 54 ] ( and which values themselves attest to the correlated nature of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the first point to note here is that the theoretical optical gap @xmath445 , indicated on figure 21 , is @xmath532 ( from @xmath13 obtained as above ) .",
    "this accords remarkably well with the gap of @xmath533 inferred experimentally from the optical conductivity [ 52 ] , and we emphasise that there is no _ a priori connection between these two ways of obtaining the optical gap  as above , the theoretical optical gap is inferred directly from the much smaller transport gap @xmath326 .",
    "there is in consequence no conundrum between a transport gap of @xmath534 and an optical gap of @xmath535 .",
    "the level of agreement between theory / experiment is self - evident in figure 21 , and encouraging both in terms of its @xmath1-dependence and thermal evolution .",
    "one small twist may also be added . for the phenomenological fitting employed in [ 52 ]",
    ", it was found that for a complete description of the conductivity spectra an additional parameter ( termed ` @xmath536 ' ) had to be introduced in the form of an additive , frequency - independent contribution to the optical conductivity ; with @xmath537 in the low - temperature regime [ 52 ] . without wishing to speculate here on the origin of the @xmath536 , the inset to figure 21 ( top panel ) shows the effect of simply adding a constant @xmath538 contribution to our theoretical optical conductivity .",
    "for low - temperatures its effect is noticeable in the @xmath539 range , particularly at the lowest @xmath540 ; and the improved agreement with experiment is clear . _",
    "finally we mention that we have taken no consideration above of the presence , in the kondo insulating gap , of an additional narrow donor - type band which is known to occur experimentally [ 52 ] in @xmath4 ( and may possibly be due to impurities ) .",
    "while certainly of interest in itself , the present theory has of course nothing to say about it ; and it plays no role in the extent to which , as above , theory concurs with experiment .",
    "resistivity [ 55 ] and optical measurements [ 56 ] have likewise been performed on single crystal @xmath5 , the only known @xmath542-based kondo insulator .",
    "experimental results for @xmath484 up to @xmath543 are shown in figure 22 , and for @xmath544 exhibit activated behaviour ( equation ( 5.1 ) ) with a transport gap @xmath545 .",
    "optical conductivity results [ 56 ] , again obtained via kramers - kronig from reflectivity spectra combined with a hagen - rubens extrapolation at low-@xmath1 , are shown in the top panel of figure 23 .",
    "the experimental optical gap is determined as @xmath546 [ 56 ] ; while the strong ir peak around @xmath547 as naturally interpretable [ 7 ] in terms of direct gap excitations ( see _ e.g.  _ figures 16,17 for the hcl ) .",
    "it is the temperature dependence of the experimental optical data which suggests to us that @xmath5 may be in an intermediate - weak coupling regime .",
    "as seen from figure 23 [ 56 ] , increasing temperatures up to @xmath548 leads to significant redistribution of spectral weight at much higher energy scales on the order of the direct gap and beyond .",
    "this is not behaviour characteristic of strong coupling , as evident from the discussion of  6 ( figures 16,17 ) .",
    "it is however typical of intermediate - weak coupling interactions , theoretical consideration of which thus requires specification of bare model parameters . in the following we consider specifically @xmath549 and @xmath460",
    ": these values should not of course be taken too seriously _",
    "per se _ , but they lead within our approach to behaviour representative of intermediate - weak coupling and should be viewed simply as such .",
    "we find with the latter that the low - temperature transport has as expected the activated form equation ( 5.1 ) , with @xmath550 and the constant @xmath551 ( as opposed to @xmath552 for the hcl in strong coupling ) .",
    "equating the theoretical @xmath326 with the experimental @xmath545 , and taking @xmath553 , direct comparison between the @xmath2-dependence of the theoretical and experimental @xmath291 s is shown in figure 22 ; and the agreement with experiment is seen to be rather good across essentially the full temperature range .",
    "does this lead to a consistent description of the optical conductivity ?",
    "the answer is yes in two senses .",
    "first , the theoretical estimate of the optical gap @xmath554 follows directly as @xmath555 using only the experimental transport gap above ; which value coincides with @xmath434 obtained directly from the optical experiments ( a situation analogous to that for @xmath4 discussed above ) .",
    "second , the resultant theoretical optical conductivity is shown in the bottom panel of figure 23 .",
    "it is seen to accord well qualitatively with the experimental results ( top panel ) , both in terms of its overall @xmath1-dependence and thermal evolution ; including the redistribution of spectral weight on energy scales beyond the direct gap , for temperatures up to @xmath556 that merely corresponds to the indirect gap itself .",
    "( improved agreement with experiment could no doubt be obtained by playing with the bare parameters , but would add little new . )",
    "we have developed in this paper a non - perturbative local moment approach to dynamics and transport properties of the symmetric periodic anderson model , the basic microscopic model for understanding small - gap kondo insulator materials [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "our primary focus has naturally been the strong coupling , kondo lattice regime . here",
    "the system is characterised by the low - energy scale @xmath13 which , being exponentially small in strong coupling , leads to a pristine separation between low- and high - energy scales ; and hence to ` universal scaling ' of dynamics / transport in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath232 alone , with no explicit dependence on bare model parameters .",
    "it is this single , indirect gap scale @xmath13 that is of paramount importance in controlling the physical properties of the system that we have investigated systematically here ; for it determines the single - particle spectral gap , the transport gap for d.c .",
    "conductivity and the optical gap in the dynamical conductivity , all of which are simply proportional to each other .",
    "it sets the scale for thermal evolution of single - particle dynamics and d.c .",
    "transport , from the gapped / activated behaviour symptomatic of the low - temperature insulator through to the incoherent single - impurity physics that is found to arise naturally for @xmath265 . and",
    "likewise it is @xmath13 that sets the thermal scale for ` filling ' the optical gap with increasing temperature ; the much higher direct gap scale naturally also being apparent in the @xmath1-dependence of the optical conductivity , but in strong coupling being essentially irrelevant as a thermal scale for its evolution .",
    "notwithstanding the innate simplicity of the pam itself , and the range of material - specific factors it naturally omits , the present theory also appears to account well for experiments on materials such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; with many characteristic features arising theoretically apparent in experiment , and a mutually consistent picture of d.c .",
    "transport and optics arising .",
    "we believe this lends further support to the essential veracity of both the underlying model ( the pam within dmft ) as well as the present theory , the local moment approach . further development of the lma to encompass the asymmetric pam , and hence heavy fermion metals , will be reported in subsequent work .",
