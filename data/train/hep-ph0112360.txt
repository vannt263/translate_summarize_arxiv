    "various solutions have been proposed @xcite all of which have implications for the production of an excess of baryons over antibaryons in the early universe , for which @xmath5 violation is a precondition .",
    "the production of gravitational kaluza - klein modes in the early universe in such models , in which some compactified extra dimensions are orders of magnitude larger than the fundamental length , gives a severe upper bound on the maximum temperature attained consistent with cosmological observations .",
    "even for the maximum number ( usually considered as 6 ) of large extra dimensions and the relatively large value @xmath13tev , a maximum temperature of a few gev is the upper bound if overclosure of the universe , disruption of the successful predictions of nucleosynthesis , and an observationally unacceptable level of background gamma - rays from k - k mode decay are to be avoided @xcite . the energy density in k - k modes would also affect the evolution of density fluctuations by altering the time of matter - radiation equality @xcite .",
    "astrophysical production and decay of such modes also leads to an independent lower bound on the fundamental scale @xcite , which is also constrained by the non - observation ( to date ) of direct and loop effects in experiments @xcite .",
    "any attempt at explaining proton longevity and baryogenesis should operate within these constraints . exact ( anomaly - free )",
    "discrete or horizontal symmetries can be imposed to forbid @xmath5-violating operators mediating proton decay @xcite while allowing others , through which baryogenesis occurs : this approach requires an `` x - boson '' to be present , with couplings which appear unnaturally small ( in contrast to the standard gut or leptogenesis scenarios ) .",
    "baryon number can be gauged if the anomaly is canceled by a string theory mechanism , or @xmath5 violation may be forbidden to all orders in perturbation theory by string selection rules , in some `` intersecting brane '' models @xcite .",
    "note however that in a more general class of intersecting brane models @xcite , such selection rules do not prevent the four - fermion operators from appearing , as discussed above , in which case the fundamental scale can not be low .    if baryon number is perturbatively exact , nonperturbative processes @xcite are the only option to create net baryon number .",

    "* first reference ) actually satisfies the bounds , since a hot plasma at temperature @xmath14 is needed . ]",
    "a novel mechanism for suppressing proton decay in the context of a low fundamental scale theory has been proposed in ref .",
    "this is a geometrical mechanism for suppressing 4d @xmath5-violating operators , namely localization of fermions in extra dimensions .",
    "the simplest implementation is for the su@xmath15 gauge fields to propagate in one extra dimension ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , in which the quark and lepton wavefunctions are peaked about points separated by a distance @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : branesetup ] ) . then any strong @xmath5-violating operators in the effective 5d theory can only produce proton decay proportional to the overlap of the wavefunctions , which can be exponentially small .",
    "alternatively , proton decay by exchange of massive modes is suppressed by the yukawa propagator over the distance @xmath17.-violating interactions propagate over the bulk . ]",
    "nonperturbative quantum effects which may lead to proton decay , for example virtual black holes @xcite , are also exponentially suppressed due to the integration over the fifth dimension .",
    "baryogenesis in such scenarios has been discussed in ref .",
    "however , the authors of that work introduced a standard model singlet scalar with renormalizable baryon number - violating interactions and primarily considered the effect of thermal corrections to the wave function overlap which controls the strength of the baryon number violation .    an affleck - dine - type scenario consistent with large extra dimensions , which involves introducing a scalar charged under a new @xmath18 group , has recently been described in @xcite ; while the idea appears viable from a cosmological viewpoint , the authors do not discuss how @xmath5-violating couplings which induce proton decay are to be suppressed , while still keeping the operators by which the scalar decays .",
    "one might imagine that additional exact symmetries could be imposed to achieve this , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider a related , but simpler class of scenarios and report mostly on a `` no go '' result .",
    "specifically , we consider the feasibility of baryogenesis under the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the only renormalizable operators that are present at the electroweak scale are those of the standard model , and the perturbative 4d effective field theory ( dimensionally reduced from an intrinsically higher - dimensional theory ) is valid .",
    "( the possibility of doing without an `` x - boson '' was briefly mentioned in @xcite . ) in other words , we work with an effective theory with top as the heaviest field that has not been integrated out and neglect any lorentz violating operators resulting from time dependence of the extra dimensional geometry .",
    "this condition is motivated from our ignorance about the physics beyond the standard model and the fact that no viable baryogenesis scenario has yet been proposed with only the standard model fields and gravity .",
    "the leading baryon number - violating operator due to physics at the fundamental scale is a dimension-6 operator of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 the wave function overlap , which is a time dependent function .",
    "the wave function overlap @xmath20 can be time - dependent whenever fermion localization is controlled by a field , akin to the radion , which is initially displaced from the minimum of its effective potential .",
    "the work of @xcite can also be taken to be of this type , where the `` radion '' is always at the minimum of a time dependent effective potential , which is derived from time dependent finite temperature effects .",
    "note that this condition implies the assumption that 4d instanton / sphaleron induced baryon number violating operators are weaker than the dimension-6 operator , _",
    "i.e. _  only perturbative physics is analyzed for dimension @xmath21 operators .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption as long as the temperature is well below the electroweak scale ( which is anyway required in low fundamental scale models ) and the su@xmath22 coupling remains small ( appendix [ app : inst ] ) .",
    "the 4d planck scale @xmath23 has an adiabatic time dependence due to the change in the volume of extra dimensions , and the fundamental scale of gravitational physics is at @xmath24gev .",
    "the upper bound on this scale comes from the desire to ameliorate the hierarchy problem without susy , while the lower bound is obtained by the bounds on neutron - antineutron oscillations , which can not be suppressed by a geometrical mechanism .",
    "note that there is still a certain amount of fine tuning , of order @xmath25 , with such a ( relatively ) large fundamental scale .",
    "there is no electroweak phase transition because of a low reheating temperature ( _ i.e. _  @xmath26gev ) @xcite .",
    "baryogenesis is also assumed to occur above the qcd phase transition temperature ( _ i.e. _  @xmath27gev ) . 5 .",
    "the effective 3d space is homogeneous and isotropic at all times when the temperature of the universe is @xmath27gev .    in this context",
    ", we analyze the possibility of baryogenesis and find specific conditions under which it is feasible .",
    "our setup contains all the necessary ingredients of baryogenesis @xcite :    1 .",
    "baryon number violation ( dimension-6 operator ) 2 .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 violation ( standard model ckm + dimension-6 operator ) - the resulting quantity is much larger than the jarlskog invariant .",
    "3 .   nonequilibrium ( spacetime expansion or other unspecified means )    the reason for the difficulty of this scenario will be ingredient 1 , the baryon number violating operator being too weak in the low temperature setting , independently of ingredients 2 and 3 . since the usual jarlskog invariant of the sm is not the relevant quantity , given the presence of dimension-6 operators , the reason why this baryogenesis scenario is difficult has nothing to do with traditional wisdom . in particular , we find that dimension-6 operators are in most cases too weak to compete with baryon number - conserving operators which create entropy , for most sets of reactants .",
    "navely , one finds this result a little surprising because one would expect @xmath30 can be easily engineered to be sufficiently large , where @xmath31 is the dimensionless quantity associated with @xmath0 violation , @xmath32 is the maximal branching ratio into the baryon number violating channel fixed by our model , @xmath33 is the number density of particles that can be converted into baryon number , @xmath34 is the number of degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy , and @xmath35 is the temperature at some fiducial time after which the baryon number is conserved .",
    "however , even though @xmath31 can be naturally large in our scenario ( not governed by the jarlskog invariant ) , @xmath36 can not in general be made large because as the baryon number violating reactions are creating baryon asymmetry , the baryon number conserving counterparts are creating proportionately large amounts of entropy density . in other words , having the quark - lepton separation go to zero does not generate order 1 branching of the baryon number violating channels . instead , such channel is always suppressed by a scale much larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "we do find an exception to our `` no go '' rule for a special situation in which the universe starts out dominated by the @xmath2 and @xmath1 quarks and gluons ( which might happen through the peculiarities of reheating after inflation ) , and the lighter quark @xmath1 is out of equilibrium while the heavier quark @xmath2 is in equilibrium , for example due to the anomalously large expansion rate and the anomalously small density of @xmath1 quarks .",
    "in this exceptional scenario , there are two key ingredients compensating the suppression of the dimension 6 operator : 1 . due to the small @xmath37 ,",
    "the @xmath2 quark interactions with out of equilibrium @xmath1 quarks do not generate significant entropy ; 2 .",
    "the integration time for baryogenesis can be made long if the expansion rate is small , due to the nonstandard cosmology of extra dimensions .",
    "however , this remote possibility , which requires additional assumptions about special initial conditions and/or more new physics , is unlikely to be realizable , and we do not have a detailed model to demonstrate its full viability .    throughout this paper , we do not assume thermal equilibrium initial conditions , except where explicitly noted .",
    "hence , although the short distance operators are fixed , the nonzero initial particle densities that exist in the universe can be _ a priori _ arbitrary combinations of species .",
    "thus , when we consider bounds , we explicitly check all likely combinations of species without any bias to their initial number distributions , except when otherwise noted .",
    "as far as the out - of - equilibrium - condition due to the expansion of the universe is concerned , we assume that somehow the planck scale can be adjusted to dial into the appropriate expansion rate .",
    "of course , in a more completely specified model , this may turn out to be problematic , due to the bounds on moduli overproduction and other light moduli problems .",
    "however , our results are robust with respect to how the moduli problems and initial conditions problems can be solved . in fact",
    "most of our results do not depend on how the particles are out of equilibrium .",
    "this broad insensitivity with respect to cosmological details is one of the key features to our work",
    ".    the order of our presentation will be as follows .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the class of braneworlds and the energy scales and couplings that we are interested in .",
    "we then present our constraint on this scenario for baryogenesis with dimension-6 operators in the low temperature regime .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the simplest way to realize the proposal of geometrical proton decay suppression is for the `` brane '' on which we live to be a nontrivial scalar field profile in an extra dimension @xcite . on a smooth manifold ,",
    "chiral fermions are localized in the presence of a scalar field profile with yukawa couplings to the fermion fields , resulting in a position - dependent effective mass term .",
    "the simplest ansatz is to take a linearly varying scalar field , which results in chiral fermion zero modes with a gaussian wavefunction , localized about the point where the effective fermion mass vanishes @xcite . on an orbifold",
    "@xcite one may impose special boundary conditions , which themselves ensure that the lowest mode is chiral , then with a scalar field which is forced to take up a kink configuration one obtains a fermion wavefunction which varies approximately as @xmath38 .    by coupling the leptons and quarks differently to different scalar fields , one may separate the zero mode wave functions such that the wave function overlap factor @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavefunctionoverlap ] ) obtains an exponentially suppressed value .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it is not easy to induce _ large _ displacements of the points of localization away from special points such as the orbifold fixed points ( whose boundary conditions force the zero of the scalar field ) without introducing arbitrary scale parameters . in this paper",
    ", we will not assume any particular mechanism to make these localization points ( which we will sometimes loosely call `` branes '' ) dynamical , but rather suppose that large dynamical displacements of the localization points ( branes ) from their final value are possible .",
    "hence , we treat @xmath39 as merely a time - dependent function that is controlled by an exponential of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant coefficient of order 1 and @xmath17 is a time - dependent function giving the distance between the quark and lepton localizations",
    ". there may be additional contributions to @xmath39 varying as @xmath42 but these will be subleading unless @xmath43 .",
    "we will see below that @xmath41 actually has to be greater than or equal to about @xmath44 in our scenario .",
    "the baryogenesis scenario is then as follows : at some early time in the evolution of the universe , @xmath45 and the baryon number violating operator is suppressed only by the fundamental scale . by the time of nucleosynthesis , @xmath46 will have settled down to today s value of about 50 , consistent with proton decay constraints ( see appendix [ app : pprotection ] ) . for the purposes of our paper",
    ", we will not need the specific details of how the quark - lepton separation is stabilized at its final value .",
    "we will show that the short - distance physics prevents sufficient baryogenesis in the minimal model that we consider , except in the special case already mentioned .",
    "since the zero mode quark and lepton wave functions are separated in the extra dimension and since the quarks and the leptons interact through the @xmath47 gauge group , these gauge fields must also propagate in the extra dimension , and the 4d gauge theory must come from dimensional reduction . similarly , since everything interacts with gravity , 4d gravity also arises from dimensional reduction .",
    "we now derive bounds on the fundamental scale as well as the size of the extra dimensions by demanding perturbativity of gauge fields propagating in the extra dimensions and that einstein gravity be recovered .    from gravitational dimensional reduction ,",
    "given that there are a total of @xmath33 extra dimensions and one of them is asymmetric with length @xmath48 , the others having lengths @xmath49 , @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the present time and @xmath53 is the reduced planck mass @xmath54 .",
    "there is also a perturbativity constraint on the yang - mills coupling constant . in @xmath55 dimensions ( for example for a @xmath56-brane ) ,",
    "the yang - mills coupling is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a dimensionless number . by dimensional reduction to 4d",
    ", we have the 4-dimensional dimensionless yang - mills coupling @xmath59 related to @xmath58 by @xmath60 if @xmath61 is to remain perturbative at time @xmath62 , we must have @xmath63 given that @xmath64 for the ew theory [ @xmath65 $ ] , we require @xmath66 if we have a scenario in which @xmath67 this is not an issue , but in general , this is constraining .    now , let us consider absolute perturbativity of the five dimensional theory .",
    "since the cutoff is set at @xmath7 , perturbativity requires @xmath68 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:4dandhigher ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 for 5d perturbativity .",
    "however , this requires the volume enhancement factor to be small . in the end , if we want to minimize this effect , we must have only a d4-brane ( _ i.e. _  @xmath70 ) .",
    "note that our perturbativity constraint is for calculational feasibility rather than necessarily for fundamental physical reasons .",
    "coming back to eq .",
    "( [ gravityscale ] ) , if we impose that @xmath71 in which the gauge fields propagate is the largest extra dimension @xmath72 where the approximate equality is due to eq.([5dpertbound ] ) , one sees that @xmath73 to restate this , if the gauge fields come from dimensional reduction of the _ largest compact _ dimension , perturbativity requires @xmath74 hence , for this scenario to have @xmath75gev , there must be compact dimensions larger than the dimension in which the gauge fields propagate",
    ".    then we take , for simplicity , 5 large extra dimensions of length @xmath76 in which the gauge fields do not propagate , and one comparatively smaller extra dimension of length @xmath77 in which ( electroweak ) gauge fields do propagate . since in that case ,",
    "@xmath78 we can choose @xmath79 furthermore , the experimental limit from neutron - antineutron oscillations forces @xmath80gev @xcite , therefore @xmath81 must be smaller than about @xmath82gev@xmath83 . in the spirit of the original motivation for large extra dimensions , namely in order to ameliorate the hierarchy problem , we take the smallest consistent value of @xmath7 and set it to @xmath84 gev .    what is important to keep in mind from this section is eq .",
    "( [ 5dpertbound ] ) .",
    "since @xmath85 , the maximum value that @xmath86 can take is @xmath87 .",
    "hence , proton decay constraint requires @xmath88 as claimed below eq .",
    "( [ eq : defzeta ] ) .",
    "furthermore , to `` unsuppress '' the dimension-6 operator , @xmath89 is required during baryogenesis .",
    "this means that if the distance between the branes @xmath17 is equal to the time dependent size of the extra dimension @xmath90 , then @xmath91 during baryogenesis .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : branesetup ] , if the distance between the branes can be adjusted independently of the size of the extra dimension , this need not be true . finally , if we require that no k - k modes of the @xmath47 gauge group contribute to the baryogenesis dynamics , we must have @xmath92 .",
    "this leads to the requirement that @xmath93 .",
    "we will henceforth take @xmath94 to be a free ( time - dependent ) parameter , with a value @xmath95    with a setup in which proton decay and other @xmath5-violating processes are suppressed by the quark - lepton separation , the next question to ask is which processes dominated at the epoch when @xmath17 was smaller ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "proton decay due to massive fermion exchange , which appears in the effective theory by operators suppressed as @xmath97 with @xmath98 , is the most `` difficult '' to suppress at the present epoch , since one requires @xmath99 at the present time up to factors of order 1 , and @xmath100 is bounded from above by @xmath101 if su@xmath102 is to remain perturbative in the bulk .",
    "decay mediated by local interactions in the @xmath103 effective field theory , requiring the localized sm fermions to propagate through the bulk with a suppression of @xmath104 , might also be problematic if @xmath105 is small relative to @xmath106 , as it must be for a credible field theory model of localization . here",
    "we would require @xmath107 today .",
    "nonperturbative effects involving the extra dimensions should also be considered , for example virtual black holes or wormholes connecting the two branes .",
    "however , given very reasonable assumptions for the topology of the corresponding instantons , their action is large enough for the effects to be negligible @xcite .",
    "all other @xmath100-dependent effects turn out generically to be smaller , including the weak instantons which do not cause proton decay but might be important in baryogenesis ( appendix [ app : inst ] ) .",
    "then , assuming that both suppression factors saturate the current bound , as @xmath100 shrinks from its present value the effective operators suppressed by @xmath104 grow much more quickly than those varying as @xmath108 . at the time of baryogenesis , for @xmath100",
    "comparable to @xmath7 , the dominant processes ( all other things being equal ) will be those mediated by the sm fermions propagating through the bulk , for which the suppression is @xmath109 .",
    "the goal now is to see if without an electroweak phase transition , we can create enough baryon asymmetry with the dimension-6 operator which is unsuppressed .",

    "the wave function overlap integral that gives rise to @xmath39 will be taken to be @xmath117 during baryogenesis .",
    "rotating the quarks and leptons into mass eigenstates , we have @xmath118 @xmath119 which corresponds to the usual flavor mixing matrices @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "since a high initial temperature is crucial , some mechanism besides just the expansion of the universe is required to keep @xmath1 out of equilibrium while is @xmath2 in equilibrium . even if the @xmath1 densities could somehow be kept small , since the self - annihilation cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath1 are approximately the same , if the cosmological expansion is responsible for the out - of - equilibrium condition , then it must delicately tune itself to be smaller than the @xmath2 scattering rate while larger than that of the @xmath1 s . however , our `` model - independent '' analysis does not rule out this scenario , and it may be viable in a complicated and fortuitous setting .    as for the scenario in which @xmath2 quarks",
    "are in equilibrium while @xmath341 quarks are out of equilibrium , it will be even more difficult ( if not impossible ) to keep @xmath341 quarks out of equilibrium for the required `` exponentially long '' duration @xmath287 , because the gluons which are supposed to be in equilibrium have one of their strongest equilibration reactions through @xmath341-@xmath354 creation . can not have approximately equilibrium distribution if the particles with which @xmath355 interacts _ most strongly _ are not in equilibrium . ] for the scenario with other quarks ( besides the top and the bottom ) in equilibrium during baryogenesis , the exponential enhancement of the duration of baryogenesis is too weak to allow sufficient baryogenesis .",
    "hence , remarkably , only one scenario , namely out of equilibrium @xmath1 quarks interacting with equilibrium @xmath2 quarks , may generate sufficient baryon asymmetry with the dimension 6 operator if the out of equilibrium mechanism can be appropriately engineered .",

    "we have studied a new scenario of baryogenesis involving dimension-6 baryon number - violating operators that would generically arise from integrating out ultraviolet degrees of freedom in the context of the standard model .",
    "the question to be answered in this scenario was whether a time - dependent dimensionless suppression coefficient for the dimension-6 operator can allow sufficient baryogenesis between the effective temperatures of @xmath356gev and @xmath320gev , if the only fields that are allowed to participate in the short distance physics are those of the standard model .",
    "the upper bound on the temperature is motivated from the cosmological bound on kk graviton decay while the lower bound is purely for our calculational feasibility ( related to the qcd phase transition ) .",
    "the time - dependent suppression coefficient was motivated from the generic possibility that with the arkani - hamed - schmaltz mechanism of suppressing proton decay , the proton decay suppression factor can be time - dependent .",
    "unfortunately , if the fundamental scale setting the size of the unsuppressed dimension-6 operator is forced up to values @xmath357tev by the bound from neutron - antineutron oscillations , the branching ratio of @xmath5-violating interactions to @xmath5-conserving interactions is set by the quantity @xmath358 .",
    "we have shown this to be too small to allow sufficient baryogenesis for most cases .",
    "another way to view this bound is that as the dimension-6 operator creates baryon asymmetry , the same reactants participate in creating entropy through @xmath5-conserving operators .",
    "the competition between the two types of reactions is almost always dominated by the @xmath5-conserving one .",
    "hence , within the perturbative setting where the 4d effective action is valid , sufficient baryogenesis in this scenario is in most cases impossible almost independently of cosmology .",

    "this involves out of equilibrium @xmath1 quarks interacting with equilibrium @xmath2 quarks from a temperature of about @xmath356gev until a temperature of @xmath320gev .",

    "furthermore , given that nonstandard cosmology of braneworlds may give a slow expansion rate , one can have baryogenesis persist for a long time period , giving a large integrated pileup .",

    "however , this scenario does pass the general tests not relying upon the specifics of the out of equilibrium mechanism .",
    "since neutrinos are almost massless and have vanishingly small tree level annihilation cross section in the limit of small @xmath360 , one would navely think that this channel might be weak enough for the baryon number - violating operator to compete with it .",
    "unfortunately , this turns out not to be the case .",
    "it is interesting to note that even with just the standard model fields , the presence of nonrenormalizable operators implies the existence of additional @xmath0-violating rephasing invariants beyond the jarlskog parameter . in any theory ,",
    "the number of physical @xmath0-violating phases is given by the number of couplings in the lagrangian that are allowed to be complex , minus the dimension of the symmetry group which describes phase redefinitions of the fields : introducing new effective operators into the sm automatically creates more @xmath0-violating invariants , even if all the couplings of the new operators are real in some basis .",
    "hence , it is not the smallness of the jarlskog invariant that prevents the success of our baryogenesis scenario .",
    "it is merely the fact that unless neutron - antineutron oscillations are suppressed by some means other than the fundamental scale , the phenomenologically acceptable scale of @xmath361tev is still too large for dimension-6 operators to play a significant role for baryogenesis below the temperature of the electroweak phase transition .    as with any `` no go '' arguments",
    ", there are many loopholes in our conclusion ( besides the one remotely possible scenario that we already mentioned ) .",
    "first , we neglected any possible nonperturbative physics .",
    "the 4d coupling constants are inversely proportional to the volume of the extra dimensions in which the gauge fields propagate . thus ,",
    "if the volume of the extra dimensions was small at some epoch in the early universe , then nonperturbative physics may dominate ( see appendix [ app : inst ] ) , given that the perturbative contributions to @xmath362 are insufficient in our scenario .",
    "for example , the @xmath363 instanton effects may become unsuppressed , giving rise to a scenario similar to that of sphaleron transitions at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "also , for effective temperatures below about @xmath346 gev , non - perturbative qcd effects will be relevant , since the quark degrees of freedom become confined .",
    "although this is not likely to change the suppression of the dimension-6 operator , the kinematics and matrix elements will be very different from our perturbative calculation done in the regime of deconfined quarks .",
    "secondly , we have neglected all effects of the kk modes ; or , in the higher dimensional picture , we have neglected the fact that the space may be inhomogeneous in the higher dimensions .",
    "for example , one may envisage a scenario in which there is a phase transition which localizes the wave functions of the quarks and the leptons",
    ". a proper description of quark - lepton separation in higher dimension will require analysis beyond the zero mode .",
    "however , this type of effect will most likely play a role in enhancing the nonequilibrium condition rather than changing the baryon number - violating branching ratio .",
    "hence , our conclusion is most likely robust with respect to this assumption .",
    "thirdly , we have neglected all cpt violation effects that must exist because of the time dependence of the quark - lepton separation .",
    "if the time scale associated with the quark - lepton separation process is very short , then there may be significant contributions from these effects to enhance the baryon number violating channels .",
    "however , such models will probably be severely constrained by the restriction on bulk graviton production , just as the reheating temperature is severely constrained .",
    "hence , although there are loopholes and caveats to our `` no go '' claims , it seems fair to conclude that with only perturbative physics , degrees of freedom beyond the standard model fields must play a significant role in baryogenesis if the effective temperature of the universe never exceeds 30 gev ( which is a very conservative upper bound for the maximum temperature in models with large extra dimensions , if the fundamental scale is to be accessible to collider experiments ) .",
    "the requirement of beyond the standard model field content is not an obvious statement , considering that we hardly impose any restrictions on the cosmology and that there is an unsuppressed dimension-6 operator as well as an effectively large @xmath0 violating phase available for baryon asymmetry generation .",
    "of course , our `` no go '' claims would be significantly relaxed if the dimension-9 operator responsible for neutron - antineutron oscillations is suppressed by some symmetry mechanism which is introduced by hand to supplement the geometrical suppression of proton decay operators .    in closing , note that even if the fundamental scale can be lowered by evading the bound from neutron - antineutron oscillation , there is a significant challenge in this type of scenario as the quarks ( and/or leptons ) must be forced out of equilibrium at rather high temperatures . to accomplish this ,",

    "to find the minimum value of @xmath17 consistent with proton stability , we consider the decay process in the four - dimensional low energy theory , where we have argued that four - fermion operators give the largest contribution .",

    "the proton decay rate calculation for these operators is analogous to muon decay in the fermi theory , giving an estimate of@xmath364 for the `` partial lifetime '' of decay into any allowed channel , where @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant of order 1 .",

    "however , it can easily be checked that the instanton rate today is many orders of magnitude smaller than the bound on such perturbative processes , therefore instantons can never have dominated over the perturbative operators , unless the perturbative operators were further suppressed by many orders of magnitude ( for example , if they vanished by an exact discrete symmetry ) .",

    "this is a counterexample to the claim that all processes are exponentially suppressed with increasing @xmath100 ; it is understood by noting that the formation of sphaleron configurations is a classical , thermally - activated process , in contrast to quantum effects which are suppressed by a massive propagator or by the euclidean action .",
