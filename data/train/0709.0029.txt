    "our 0z project has now taken moderate resolution spectra of more than 600 candidates with the double spectrograph @xcite on the hale 5-m telescope at palomar mountain , and more than 1100 at the 6.5 m clay and baade telescopes at the las campanas observatory .",

    "these include , for example , three fe  ii lines near 3270    which are stronger than any in the optical band .",
    "this is important as often only the two strongest fe  ii lines in the optical are detected in even high quality spectra of such extremely metal poor giants ; the remaining optical fe  ii lines are too weak . for the most extreme emp dwarfs ,",

    "if these slopes were valid , they would suggest that for these two stars , @xmath2  needs to be decreased by @xmath7300  k to achieve excitation equilibrium for fe  i. however , a careful scrutiny of the behavior of the derived fe abundance from individual fe  i lines indicates that the problem lies largely in the 0  ev lines ; for those of higher excitation ( the majority of the lines ) , the deduced abundance shows no statistically significant dependence on @xmath30 .",
    "a typical example of this is shown in fig .",

    ". the ratios of [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] among the emp stars analyzed by our 0z project , including those discussed here , show a very wide range among both the c - normal and c - rich emp stars ( see fig .  [ figure_sr_ba ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that no star in the present sample , neither c - normal nor c - rich , has [ ba / fe ] @xmath94  dex . among more metal - rich c - rich stars ,",
    "the fraction of stars with enhancements of the @xmath54-process elements is large , exceeding 75% ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of c - enhanced stars among emp stars is a very contentious issue . adopting the definition of c - enhanced stars of @xcite as those with [ c / fe ] @xmath95  dex , recent values for this fraction from several independent survey for stars with [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath96  dex cover the range from @xmath970.2% @xcite to 9@xmath982% @xcite , with our 0z survey yielding a preliminary value of 14@xmath984% @xcite .",
    "the samples are in each case reasonably large , but there is a fairly large range in the deduced frequency of c - rich emp stars .",
    "this suggests that differences in the analysis are contributing to this problem .",
    "it is not surprising in the context of the previous discussion ( see , for example , that of  [ section_heres ] ) that the fraction of c - rich stars calculated from a set of different independent analyses of large samples would result in different estimates from different surveys .",
    "our [ fe / h ] values are systematically higher than those of @xcite by @xmath70.3 dex , and the differences in c and n abundances determined from molecular bands between the two surveys show a larger dispersion than do the abundances based on atomic absorption lines .",
    "stars near the boundary of the c - enhanced class could easily be shifted into or out of the c - rich class as a result of small systematic differences between the various ongoing large projects .",
    "this would affect such frequency calculations , whatever the specific abundance characteristic of interest might be .",
    "since there are many stars near the boundary of the c - enhanced class as defined above , we suggest that a substantial part of the variation in the deduced fraction of c - enhanced emp stars arises from such differences in the details of the analysis .",
    "it is thus extremely important for people engaged in this type of work to publish the full details of their analyses , as we did in @xcite , and to analyze a few stars in common with other major groups working in this area . among the details that must be described , in addition to those discussed above ,",
    "is the issue of the way one handles the recent upheaval in the solar cno abundances through the work of @xcite and @xcite with 3d models .",
    "the modified definition of the cutoff for enhanced [ c / fe ] suggested by @xcite offers the advantage of a cleaner cut with fewer stars near the boundary between c - normal and c - enhanced classes .",
    "it is preferable to the definition we are using , which is that of @xcite . with the latter definition ,",
    "two of the three stars are just at the boundary , while with the newer definition , all three of the c - rich stars discussed here would clearly be considered c - rich .",
    "we have presented detailed abundance analyses of five extremely metal poor giants which are newly discovered from our datamining of the hamburg / eso survey .",
    "one of these turned out to be a rediscovery of a star found in the hk survey with an unusually large error in its published coordinates .",
    "we include here a new analysis based on better spectra of he0132@xmath42429 , part of the keck pilot project ( see cohen et al 2002 and carretta et al 2002 ) .",
    "we also analyze new high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the only emp giant found in the heres project @xcite and of an emp giant from the first stars project to use as a calibration object for comparison of the two projects , for a total sample of 8 emp giants .",
    "the high quality of our hires spectra and our discovery of many more emp stars , including some close to @xmath99  dex , makes it possible to search for , to find , and to confirm outliers which have anomalous abundance ratios [ x / fe ] among the fe - peak elements , where such have not been detected previously .",
    "the lowest metallicity star in our sample , he1424@xmath40241 , with [ fe / h ] @xmath100 dex , has only upper limits for the c and n abundances , based on our non - detection of the g band of ch and of the 3360    band of nh .",
    "this star shows highly anomalous abundance ratios , with extremely low [ si / fe ] ( @xmath101  dex ) and very low [ ca / fe ] ( @xmath102 dex ) and [ ti / fe ] ( @xmath103 dex ) , while [ mg / fe ] is normal .",
    "mg is produced in hydrostatic @xmath78-burning , while the other three elements are made in explosive @xmath78-burning . in essentially all other emp stars , these three abundance ratios are positive .",
    "these deficits in he1424@xmath40241 are accompanied by strong excesses for the odd atomic number elements , so that [ mn / fe ] and [ co / fe ] are significantly larger than is typical of all other emp giants . we speculate that the parcel of gas from which this star formed in the early milky way contained ejecta from only a few snii , and was deficient in ejecta from core collapse sn whose progenitors had masses at the upper end of the relevant range .",
    "the nucleosynthesis was such that the explosive @xmath78-elements ( si , ca and ti ) were not produced by the snii at typical rates , while the hydrostatic @xmath78-element mg , formed during the course of normal stellar evolution even in zero metallicity stars , was produced at normal rates .",
    "a second outlier , he0132@xmath104 , shows enhanced sc relative to fe , with [ n / c ] @xmath105 .",
    "we suggest that this chemical inventory of this star had the opposite bias , namely a larger contribution from snii toward the upper end of the progenitor mass range near 60@xmath85 .",
    "the remaining three c - normal stars have abundance ratios typical of slightly more metal rich emp stars ; they do not show any detectable anomalies in their chemical inventory .",
    "no other emp giant known to us shows peculiar abundance ratios among the fe - peak elements .",
    "one emp dwarf , he2344@xmath42800 , first studied in the keck pilot project , and now revisited with a better hires spectrum , appears to have [ cr / fe ] @xmath92  dex and [ mn / fe ] of @xmath93  dex higher than typical emp dwarfs , a large sample of which were studied in @xcite .",
    "c and n have only upper limits in this hot dwarf , where the molecular bands are , even for normal [ c / fe ] ratios , very weak and difficult to detect .",
    "many emp stars show unexpectedly high cno abundances , which are likely due to intrinsic production followed by mixing ( for luminous giants only ) or pollution from a former agb binary companion . a smaller number of stars , including two of the three c - rich stars studied here , show large enhancements of the light elements na , mg and al as well .",
    "all such @xmath78-enhanced stars with the exception of bs16964@xmath4002 , very recently discovered by @xcite , are c - rich , and this star is highly o - rich .",
    "the behavior of the c - rich stars contains no surprises .",
    "two in our present sample have large enhancements of the light elements through al ; the third shows normal abundance ratios for na , mg and al with respect to fe .",
    "two of the sample stars have [ n / c ] @xmath89 , which is not common among c - rich emp giants .",
    "it is generally believed that c - rich emp stars are the result of mass transfer within a binary system when the former primary was an agb star .",
    "if this is true , nucleosynthesis calculations by @xcite , @xcite and references therein suggest that to produce such a large excess of n the former primary must have a mass towards the upper end of the range for agb stars .",
    "we present the first determination of [ cu / fe ] for emp giants below [ fe / h ] @xmath106  dex based on the rarely measured uv resonance lines of cu  i near 3250   .",
    "we find that the plateau level which was suggested for [ cu / fe ] for dwarfs with [ fe / h ] @xmath107  dex by @xcite continues to even lower metallicities .",
    "the heavy neutron capture elements are low in all eight emp stars in our sample , with [ ba / fe ] @xmath59  dex .",
    "this is rare among more fe - rich c - stars , which often have strong @xmath54-process enhancements .",
    "the ratio @xmath26(ba)/ @xmath26(sr ) varies by more than a factor of 100 among the stars studied here , and suggests again that another nucleosynthesis mechanism that preferentially produces the light neutron capture elements such as sr is required .",
    "a careful comparison of the procedures and results of the detailed abundance analyses carried out by our 0z project with those of the first stars project @xcite demonstrates that there is a systematic offset between the deduced [ fe / h ] values ; ours being on average 0.3  dex higher .",
    "thus the most metal poor star we found , he1424@xmath40241 , with [ fe / h ] @xmath100 dex based on our 0z project analysis , would translates roughly into @xmath108 dex if it were analyzed by the first stars project of @xcite . for elements which display measurable atomic absorption features , the differences between these two projects results in systematic changes in abundance ratios with respect to fe which are much smaller .",
    "inter - comparison between surveys of abundances [ x / fe ] derived from molecular bands , typically used to determine cno abundances , is much less common and more difficult to carry out .",
    "systematic differences between surveys for cno abundances from ch , nh , cn , co or oh bands may be common and may be larger than for elements where atomic lines can be utilized .",
    "any such systematic differences between surveys may affect the deduced fraction of c - rich stars found in a survey and may contribute to the wide range in published values for this parameter .",
    "we have observed @xmath7100 emp candidates with andicam in queue mode over the past three years .",
    "we calibrate to the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system using standard star fields from @xcite .",
    "the observer at ctio running the queue only carries out our program if the night is believed to be photometric .",
    "data from nights which at sunset were believed to be photometric , but subsequently the observer changed his opinion of the sky conditions , were discarded .",
    "the zero points of our photometric calibration are based on two sets of images of standard star fields per night in almost all cases , and never more than two .",
    "most stars were observed only on one night ; about 1/3 were observed on two nights , and a few on three nights .",
    "we assess whether our assigned photometric errors for andicam photometry of the he s candidate emp stars are valid by comparison of stars from our sample which are included in much larger , and hopefully better calibrated , photometric surveys .",
    "this is a key issue since we use this photometry , together with @xmath109 from 2mass , to determine stellar parameters .",
    "we compare our values with those from the sdss @xcite dr4 release @xcite , using the transformations of @xcite for johnson @xmath17 and kron - cousins @xmath18 .",
    "there are 26 stars in common .",
    "the mean difference in @xmath17 and in @xmath18 between that we measure using andicam and that from the sdss database appropriately transformed is less than 0.01 mag .",
    "the dispersion about the mean is 0.06 mag for each of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , somewhat larger than one might expect for our nominal errors of @xmath110  mag for each combined with the nominal uncertainties of @xmath111  mag for the sdss .",
    "this suggests that our assessment of the uncertainty in our andicam photometry may be somewhat underestimated .",
    "the sdss is a very large area survey with a very extensive photometric calibration effort , and our andicam measurements agree well in the mean with the sdss values , suitably transformed .",
    "this suggests that the photometric calibration of our andicam data has no systematic errors .",
    "the recent large photometric survey of emp candidate stars of @xcite includes 17 stars from our andicam sample .",
    "@xcite include data taken at many sites with many different instruments on many different runs .",
    "for these 17 stars , our @xmath17 is fainter by 0.05  mag on average , with @xmath44 of the differences being 0.05  mag .",
    "our @xmath112 colors are identical to within @xmath63 mag on average with those of @xcite for the 12 stars with such colors in the survey of @xcite , with @xmath44 of the difference being 0.03  mag .",
    "the ( identical ) systematic difference in @xmath17 and in @xmath18 may arise from calibration difficulties across a survey with such a wide variety of data sources .",
    "he1424@xmath40241 , the most metal - poor star discussed here , has @xmath17(andicam , sdss , beers ) = 15.47 , 15.36 , 15.32  mag respectively , and is among the three stars with the largest deviation in @xmath17 for both of these comparisons .",
    "its @xmath18 mag is the same ( differing by only 0.015 mag ) for the sdss and for the andicam data , while the @xcite photometry for this star has @xmath112 identical to the andicam result , but @xmath17 brighter by 0.15  mag .",
    "if we assume the sdss @xmath113 to be correct , then we have underestimated @xmath2  for this star by @xmath7130  k , the nominal uncertainty we adopt for this key stellar parameter is 100  k.",
    "in this appendix we provide additional details , beyond the discussion given in  [ section_comp ] , of the comparison of the analyses we have carried out for emp giants with those of the first stars project as given in @xcite .",
    "we selected a representative sample of stars from @xcite to cover the range of stellar parameters of interest here ( [ fe / h ] below @xmath106  dex and log(@xmath19 )  as expected for rgb stars ) .",
    "three values of @xmath2  determined for each of these stars are shown in table  [ table_teff_cayrel ] .",
    "the first is the value we would derive using the codes and procedures of the 0z project , including reddening from the map of @xcite .",
    "the second is that we would derive if we used @xmath114 from @xcite instead .",
    "the third is that adopted by the first stars project , taken from table  4 of @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the @xmath17  mag given in table  2 of @xcite was used .",
    "@xmath2  for the second and third cases are given in the table as differences from that of our 0z project .    at first sight",
    "the differences between the @xmath2  adopted by each project for the representative sample of stars given in the last column of table  [ table_teff_cayrel ] are satisfactory considering the quoted accuracies of @xmath2  by us of @xmath115  k and by the first stars project of @xmath6680  k. however , we stress that this is a systematic , not a random , effect . table  [ table_teff_cayrel ] shows , by comparing the first and second values of @xmath2  given for each star , that the somewhat larger values of @xmath114 that we adopt result in our @xmath2  being higher than that of the first stars project by up to @xmath7100  k. this difference depends both on the reddening difference for the particular star ( i.e. where the star is in the sky ) and on @xmath2  for the star , as hotter stars have smaller values of @xmath116@xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition , for a specified set of stellar colors and a fixed choice of reddening , comparing the second and third choices for @xmath2 , we find that our @xmath2  are higher by up to 100  k. this must arise from some systematic difference in the transformation within the grid of colors ( specifically @xmath117 and @xmath16 ) and the stellar parameters for emp giants . it should be noted that the @xmath2  given by @xcite are based on the @xcite relations while ours are based on those of the marcs and atlas model atmosphere grids .",
    "this issue was discussed in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the marcs and atlas9 @xmath2  color - relations are in very good agreement , but that they disagree with those of @xcite .",
    "we also note that the @xcite color relations have not been calibrated adequately at the very low values of [ fe / h ] considered here ; a theoretical calibration is easier to achieve at present than an observational one for emp stars .",
    "the result of adding these two effects is that our @xmath2  would be from 30 to 165  k hotter than those adopted by @xcite for the same input set of observed colors , with the hotter stars in the sample ( @xmath2@xmath118  k ) having larger differences than the cooler ones ; the coolest stars in our sample have @xmath2@xmath119  k. this of course will result in a systematic offset such that the [ fe / h ] value deduced for a star with a particular set of @xmath31  will be higher as determined by the 0z project than as determined by the first stars project @xcite .",
    "this is accompanied by a smaller effect on the deduced abundance ratios , as we will see below .    since @xcite use ionization equilibrium to determine log(@xmath19 ) , given a @xmath2 , while we use evolutionary tracks , there is some scatter of the difference of log(@xmath19)between the two projects for a given star . in most cases",
    "the difference is small ; the largest difference among the stars compared in table  [ table_teff_cayrel ] is 0.4 dex for the same input parameters .",
    "we next isolate the differences introduced into the abundance ratios by the different abundance analysis codes and model atmosphere grids between our 0z project and the first stars project .",
    "recall that we use model atmospheres from atlas @xcite while the first stars project uses osmarcs models @xcite .",
    "we first note that changing to the latest and currently preferred kurucz models which have a somewhat different treatment of convection with no overshooting described in @xcite and an improved opacity distribution function ( which are labeled as `` odfnew '' models ) leads to very small changes ( not exceeding 0.01 dex ) in the derived log[@xmath26(x ) ] for all species considered here .",
    "the predicted model colors @xmath117 and @xmath16 differ by less than 0.02 mag in this range of [ fe / h ] and @xmath2 , introducing a change of less than 50  k in deduced @xmath2",
    ". since these stars are so metal - poor , the details of the treatment of the line opacity used in computing the model atmosphere do not matter .",
    "for this test , we assume , for a given star , the same stellar parameters as @xcite derived . we then carry out an abundance analysis using our codes and our model atmospheres appropriate to those input stellar parameters , and compare the resulting [ fe / h ] values and abundance ratios [ x / fe ] .",
    "first we compare the deduced values of log[@xmath26(x ) ] for three stars .",
    "the first case we examined is the bright emp giant cd @xmath120 245 .",
    "we use the @xmath31and @xmath22 values from @xcite ; we do not have any hires spectra of this star . for the other two stars , bs16467@xmath4062 and cs22949@xmath4037 ( a.k.a .",
    "he2323@xmath40256 ) we have independent hires spectra ; we use our own measured @xmath31  and our own adopted atomic parameters .    the comparison for the three stars is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_cayrel_diff ] .",
    "this figure shows our absolute abundances being systematically about 0.15  dex larger for all species .",
    "this difference is similar to that found by @xcite ( see their fig .  1 )",
    ", who have carried out a similar test for stellar parameters appropriate to cepheid variables .",
    "this systematic offset would be largely eliminated if we were to use a stellar atmosphere which was @xmath790  k lower than the @xmath2  adopted by the first stars project .",
    "the agreement for the c and n abundances , with differences as large as 0.4 dex , is not as good .",
    "this is not surprising , as we have shown in ",
    "[ section_comp ] that the @xmath22 values for atomic absorptoin lines adopted by both projects are in very good agreement .",
    "the c and n abundances , on the other hand , are derived from molecular bands and many more parameters enter , none of which have been compared between the two projects .",
    "the offset from equality shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_cayrel_diff ] does not affect the deduced abundance ratios [ x / fe ] derived from our work and the first stars project as the offset is approximately constant for all species considered .",
    "however the first stars project adopts log@xmath26(fe ) = 7.50  dex for the sun , while we use a value 0.05 dex smaller .",
    "since , as we have shown earlier , the @xmath22 value scales are identical , we will therefore see a systematic difference of 0.05  dex in all values of [ x / fe ] and in [ fe / h ] , with our values being higher ( i.e. more metal - rich ) .",
    "this is in addition to the offset of 0.15  dex due to differences in the model atmosphere grids and analysis codes .    for cd@xmath438  245",
    "both analyses give very good ionization equilibrium , so it matters little whether one uses fe  i or fe  ii as the reference .",
    "ideally , since log@xmath121feii ) is less sensitive to @xmath2 , it would be better to use that in calculating [ fe / h ] and [ x / fe ] , but there are few fe  ii lines detected in these emp stars , and many of those detected are very weak with somewhat unreliable @xmath31 .",
    "the differences in [ x / fe ] for the 12 species in common ( ignoring the reference species , fe  i ) range from @xmath65 to + 0.05 dex , with a mean of @xmath122 dex and @xmath44 of 0.04 dex , which we consider very good agreement .",
    "the difference in the deduced abundance ratios between our 0z project and the first stars project for he2323@xmath40256 , ignoring n ( deduced from the nh band at 3360     in both cases ) , ranges from @xmath103 to + 0.11 dex for the 11 species in common , with a mean of @xmath65 dex and @xmath44 0.10 dex .",
    "( that for [ n / fe ] is 0.38 dex , with our value being lower . )",
    "part of this may arise in the problem with the @xmath31  for this star ; incorrect values were published by @xcite for at least 7% of the lines in common with our 0z values given here in table  [ table_eqw ] ( m.  spite , private communication , july 2007 ) . the ionization equilibrium of fe is good in both analyses .",
    "bs  16467062 , the third case we checked , gives similar results . here , with the stellar parameters set by the first stars project , the difference in log@xmath26(fe  i ) is 0.16  dex , with our value again being higher .",
    "the ionization equilibrium in our solution for this set of stellar parameters is log(@xmath26)(fe  i ) ",
    "log(@xmath26)(fe  ii ) + 0.04 dex ; for the first stars project derived + 0.12  dex .    but",
    "the true comparison is what happens when we use the stellar parameters derived with our own codes and procedures and the reddening values we adopt ( i.e. our systematically higher @xmath2  as compared to those of the first star project ) . for bs  16467062 ,",
    "if we compare log@xmath26(fe  i ) as published by @xcite versus that given in table  [ table_abunda ] and [ table_abundb ] , the difference in [ fe / h ] 0.30 dex , with our value being higher .",
    "the higher @xmath2  we adopt ( 164  k higher than that of the first stars project ) based on our higher reddening and on our @xmath2  scale is somewhat compensated by the difference in adopted log(@xmath19 ) . the difference in adopted @xmath2  for cs22949 - 037 ( a.k.a .",
    "he2323@xmath40256 ) between the two projects is small only because our @xmath17  mag from andicam photometry is 0.05  mag fainter than that adopted by @xcite .",
    "we thus find a difference of + 0.18  dex in the final deduced [ fe / h ] , our value being higher .",
    "this , given the essentially identical @xmath2 , reflects just the difference in analysis details discussed above .    in summary",
    ", it appears that the different analysis codes , and stellar atmospheres grids adopted lead to [ fe / h ] values from our 0z project being systematically 0.15@xmath123  dex higher than those of the first stars project .",
    "the difference becomes somewhat larger , @xmath70.25 dex , when the hotter stellar parameters determined from the independent codes , procedures , and adopted reddening map of our 0z project are used instead of those adopted by @xcite .",
    "there is an additional contribution of 0.05 dex to the difference in derived [ fe / h ] from the two projects which arises from the difference in the adopted solar fe abundance .",
    "overall , the [ fe / h ] value derived by the first stars project as described in @xcite will be systematically @xmath70.3  dex lower than that for the same star , the same set of @xmath31 , and the same set of observed stellar photometry as analyzed by the 0z project .",
