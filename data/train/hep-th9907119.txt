    "it does appear that the properties of low dimensional manifolds can be very successfully unraveled by relating them to infinite dimensional manifolds of fields .",

    "let us start with a brief discussion of knots and links .",
    "_ what is knot ? _ a smooth non - intersecting closed curve in a three - manifold is a knot .",
    "oriented closed curves are oriented knots .",
    "a string with its ends joined in the shape of a circle without any entanglements is a model for the simplest non - intersecting closed curve called _",
    "unknot_. with a given knot , we associate a _ knot diagram _ obtained by projecting the knot on to a plane with a minimum number of double points . in such a diagram over - crossings and under - crossing are to be clearly marked . the number of double points in a knot diagram is called its _ crossing number_.",
    "a few simple knots with low crossing numbers are :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    clearly , for a given minimum number of crossings , there can be more than one type of topologically inequivalent knots .",
    "the number of knots increases rapidly with the crossing number . for crossing number 9 , there are 49 knots ( not distinguishing mirror reflections ) , for 10 there are 165 and for crossing number 11 we have 552 knots . for 13 crossings ,",
    "there are more than 10,000 different knots .    _ what is a link ? _ a collection of a number of oriented non - intersecting loops ( knots )",
    "is an oriented link .",
    "a knot then is single component link .",
    "links like knots can be represented by their two dimensional projections , _ the link diagrams _ with minimum number of double points , but with the over - crossings and under - crossings clearly marked .",
    "examples of a few two - component links are :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    to a topologist , length , thickness or precise shape of a knot are not of any interest .",
    "two knots or links are to be identified if one can be made to go continuously into other by shrinking or stretching or wiggling without snapping the string .",
    "there is a minimal set of elementary rules which encode these qualitative notions more precisely .",
    "these are the three reidemeister moves which do not change the topological type of a link :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    invariance under all these three moves is called invariance under _",
    "ambient isotopy_. if a quantity is invariant under type ii and iii moves only , but not under type i moves , it is said to be a _ regular isotopic invariant .",
    "_    the reidemeister move iii is of particular interest .",
    "it represents a defining relation for the generators of braids .",
    "in addition , it is a graphical representation of the yang - baxter relation of statistical mechanical models .",
    "these facts are not accidental but reflect a deep connection that knots and links have with braids and exactly solvable two - dimensional vertex models @xcite . in fact",
    "this connection has been successfully exploited to obtain infinitely many new exactly solvable statistical mechanical models@xcite .",
    "though the reidemeister rules are so simple , it is not an easy exercise in general to tell whether given two knots or links are topologically distinct or not .",
    "for example , it took nearly eighty years , since the time of knot tables of c.n .",
    "little from the end of last century to the work of k.a .",
    "perko in 1972 , to recognize that the knots in the figure below are isotopically equivalent@xcite :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    finding mathematical methods for distinguishing knots and links is indeed an important problem in knot theory . to this end , some definite invariants , called _ link invariants",
    "_ , are associated with the links .",
    "these are mathematical expressions which depend only on the isotopic type of the link and not on any of its particular representations .",
    "some such invariants are in the form of polynomials .",
    "first polynomial invariant was discovered in late twenties by j.w .",
    "it took almost sixty more years before the next one was discovered by v.r.f .",
    "the new invariant proved to be topologically more powerful than that of alexander .",
    "for example , unlike alexander polynomial , jones polynomial does distinguish many mirror reflected knots . soon after , a two variable generalization of jones invariant was found @xcite .",
    "though two distinct jones polynomials do represent two isotopically distinct knots , the converse is not always true .",
    "there are examples of distinct knots with same jones polynomial .",
    "still jones work represents a leap forward in the developments of knot theory .",
    "what is impressive about the topological field theoretic description of knots is that it provides a whole variety of link invariants in a straight forward manner . of these jones one - variable polynomial and its two - variable generalization",
    "are the simplest examples .    before starting a discussion of knots and links in terms of a quantum field theory ,",
    "let us make a few historical remarks about knots and links in physics .",
    "* a few historical remarks : *   knots and links first captured the imagination of physicists when lord kelvin ( william thomas ) introduced them as early as 1857 as fluid - mechanical models of atoms @xcite .",
    "reluctant to accept the prevailing notion of an infinitely rigid point - like atom , he thought of atoms as vortex - lines in a perfect homogeneous fluid , the _",
    "ether_. different sorts of atoms were then to differ in accordance with the number of intersections of these vortex rings .",
    "`` stability '' of the atoms in this theory thus is a reflection of the fact that knots do preserve their essential knottedness during their movement .",
    "indeed lord kelvin would have wanted to develop a new theory of gasses , theory of elastic solids and liquids based on the dynamics of these vortex atoms  a programme he did not complete nor was considered by later day physicists worth while in this context . however , a new area , _ knot theory _ , of mathematics was born .",
    "two contemporary scottish physicists , j.c . maxwell and p.g .",
    "tait did find lord kelvin s hypothesis attractive enough .",
    "tait had hoped to explain the position of lines in the spectrum of a chemical element from the knot type representing it .",
    "thus , it was natural for him to attempt the formidable task of classifying knots in three - space .",
    "for this he needed some measure of complexity of a knot .",
    "thus the concept of the _ degree of knottedness _ was introduced .",
    "this is what we nowadays call crossing number of a knot , a notion already defined above .",
    "tait with this notion of crossing number , produced the first knot tables , listing knots in order of their increasing knottedness . if atoms had been really knots , we would have been studying these tables instead of the periodic table of chemical elements in our schools .    since the pioneering work of these physicists , knot theory was solely investigated by mathematicians till about ten years ago when physicists came back to it through quantum field theories .",
    "this brings us to modern field theoretic interpretation of knots in three dimensions .",
    "in a field theory , the properties of a system of infinitely many oscillators are represented collectively by a field , @xmath3 defined over all the space though the space label @xmath4 .",
    "an action functional is prescribed for these fields .",
    "for example , for a one - component scalar field @xmath5 , say in three dimensional flat euclidean space @xmath6 , the action functional may be taken to be :    @xmath7~=~ { \\frac 1 { 2 } } \\int d^3x ~\\delta^{\\mu \\nu } \\partial_{\\mu } \\phi(x ) \\partial_{\\nu } \\phi(x ) ~ , \\nonumber\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 are space indices and for @xmath6 , the metric is flat @xmath9 . for a theory defined over a general curved three - manifold endowed with a metric @xmath10 ( and its inverse @xmath11 ) , this action generalizes to :    @xmath7~=~ { \\frac 1 { 2 } } \\int d^3x { \\sqrt { g(x)}}~g^{\\mu \\nu}(x )   \\partial_{\\mu } \\phi(x ) \\partial_{\\nu } \\phi(x ) ~ ,   \\nonumber\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 .    similarly for a vector field @xmath13 , the gauge field of maxwell theory in three dimensions",
    ", we write the action functional as :    @xmath14~=~ { \\frac 1 { 4 } } \\int d^3x { \\sqrt { g(x)}}~g^{\\mu \\alpha}(x ) g^{\\nu \\beta}(x )     \\bigl [ \\partial_{\\mu } a_{\\nu}(x ) -   \\partial_{\\nu}a_{\\mu}(x )   \\bigr ]    \\bigl [ \\partial_{\\alpha } a_{\\beta}(x ) -\\partial_{\\b } a_{\\a}(x )   \\bigr ]   \\nonumber\\ ] ]    both these actions above are invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "quantum field theories normally studied , like the examples above , depend on the metric @xmath15 of the three - manifold in which the theory is defined .",
    "the metric describes the geometric properties , such as distances , curvature etc .",
    "but , here we are interested in attempting a field theoretic description of knots and links in such a way that only their topological properties are represented . their size , exact shape , location etc are not of our concern .",
    "the topological properties , unlike these , do not depend on the metric .",
    "thus we are seeking a field theory which is independent of the metric .",
    "such theories are called _ topological field theories_. a simple example of metric independent field theory is the chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "its action in the abelian version ( with convenient normalization ) is given by :    @xmath16~=~ - { \\frac k { 8\\pi } } \\int_{s^3 } d^3x ~ \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\alpha } a_{\\mu}(x)\\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\alpha}(x)\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is a completely anti - symmetric contravariant three - tensor density whose only nonzero component is @xmath18 . for definiteness",
    ", we shall discuss this theory in a three - manifold @xmath0 .",
    "clearly this action is independent of the metric .",
    "also it is invariant under general coordinate transformations . like the maxwell theory ,",
    "this theory exhibits a gauge invariance .    the quantum version of this theory is described by the functional integral representing the partition function :    @xmath19 ~e^{iks } \\label{abel}\\ ] ]    and for metric independent gauge invariant functionals @xmath20 $ ] of the gauge field @xmath21",
    ", we have the functional averages ( vacuum expectation values of the associated operators ) :    @xmath22~ w~ e^{iks } \\label{abel1}\\ ] ]    though the action and gauge invariant functionals @xmath23 do not depend on the metric , there are potential sources which can introduce metric dependence in these functional averages",
    ". the functional integration may be thought of to be done by discretizing the space into a mesh .",
    "infinitely many ordinary integrals over @xmath24 at every point @xmath4 of the mesh are to be done and finally the limit of mesh size going to zero is taken in some well defined manner .",
    "this is the usual way we understand these infinite dimensional integrals .",
    "further , there is a gauge invariance in the theory , which like in other gauge theories needs to be fixed by a choice of gauge .",
    "both the choice of mesh as well as gauge fixing condition are generically metric dependent .",
    "thus the gauge fixed measure of integration @xmath25 $ ] in a field theory defined on a curved space , in general depends on the metric .",
    "however , despite these , it can be shown that various metric dependence so conspire in this topological theory that they cancel out without spoiling the metric independence of the functional averages @xcite .",
    "now let us give an explicit form of a topological operator @xmath23 in this abelian chern - simons theory .",
    "consider a link @xmath26 made up of knots @xmath27 .",
    "wilson knot operator for each these knots @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 $ ] where @xmath30 is an integer measuring the charge on the loop .",
    "clearly these are independent of the metric .",
    "then the wilson link operator is product of all such knot operators :    @xmath31 \\ = \\ \\prod_{\\ell=1}^s~exp\\bigl[i~n_{\\ell}\\oint_{k_{\\ell } } dx^{\\mu } a_{\\mu}(x)\\bigr]\\ ] ]    if we expand the exponential here , the expectation value @xmath32 \\rangle$ ] is given by the expectation values of the various terms in this expansion .",
    "this is a non - interacting theory ; all these expectation values are given in terms of the `` two - loop '' expectation values only :    @xmath33    here in the first expression the two loops are distinct in contrast to the second expression where both the loop integrals are along the same knot .",
    "clearly , these expressions can be easily evaluated in terms of the two - point correlator @xmath34 . to do this , we can locally identify the region containing our link with @xmath6 so that we can use the flat metric @xmath35 in this region .",
    "then @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the euclidean flat coordinates along the two knots @xmath28 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "this allows us to do away with the complications connected with the curved nature of the three - manifold @xmath0 ; we can do all our calculations in flat euclidean space without loss of generality .",
    "elementary field theory allows us to read off the flat space two - point correlator from the action ( subject to a gauge condition , which we choose to be the covariant lorentz gauge @xmath39 ):",
    "@xmath40 so that @xmath41 this double loop integral over two distinct knots ( @xmath42 ) is a well known topological invariant , called _ gauss linking number _ of the two closed curves .",
    "it measures the number of times one knot @xmath28 goes through the other knot @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , linking number of two knots is an integer .",
    "for example , for the right - handed hopf link @xmath44 ,    0.5 cm    0.5 cm its value is @xmath45 .",
    "its value for the mirror reflection of this link ( left - handed hopf ) is @xmath46 .",
    "linking number does not depend on the exact location of the two knots , nor on their size or shape .",
    "it depends only on their topological relationship with each other .",
    "this invariant has a physical interpretation due to maxwell  in electrodynamics , it represents the work done to move a magnetic monopole around one knot in three - space while an electric current runs through the other knot .",
    "the abelian chern - simons theory also provides a representation for yet another simple topological quantity associated with an individual knot called its _ self - linking number _ and also some times _ framing number _ or simply _",
    "framing_. this is related to the second expectation value given in ( [ twoloop ] ) where the two loop integrals are over the same knot .",
    "this expectation value is to be evaluated through a limiting procedure :",
    "to a knot @xmath47 parametrized by @xmath48  @xmath49 along the length of the knot by the parameter @xmath50 , associate another closed curve @xmath51 , called its _ frame , _ given by coordinates @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a small parameter and @xmath54 is a unit vector field normal ( principal normal ) to the curve at @xmath50 .",
    "that is , @xmath51 is the curve @xmath47 displaced along the normal by a small amount .",
    "then the linking number of the curve @xmath47 and its frame @xmath51 is called self - linking number @xmath55 of the knot : @xmath56    this self - linking number is independent of the parameter @xmath53 and can easily be shown to obey the following important theorem , first proven by g. calugareanu almost forty years ago @xcite :    * calugareanu theorem * : _ the self - linking number of a knot is the sum of its twist and writhe numbers : _",
    "@xmath57    where the vector field @xmath58 is given by @xmath59    is a map @xmath60 and @xmath54 is the normal vector field along the length of the curve @xmath61 .",
    "the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent well defined _ geometric _ properties of the knot .",
    "@xmath62 represents the _ twist _ in the knot @xmath47 with reference to its frame @xmath51 and @xmath63 is the amount of _ writhe _ or _ coiling _ of the knot . clearly , the twist number and writhe number are not necessarily integers nor are they ambient isotopic invariants .",
    "but their sum , the self - linking number , is indeed an integer and also an ambient isotopic invariant .",
    "this theorem can be easily appreciated if we recall that stretching a coiled up telephone cord reduces its coils but increases its twist and loosening of a twisted cord coils it up .",
    "the amount of coils lost ( or gained ) is exactly the same as the amount by which the twisting is gained ( or lost ) so that their sum is always unchanged .",
    "this theorem of calugareanu when applied to circular ribbon ( which can be thought of as a framed closed curve ) has been put to good use in the study of the properties of circular polymers and circular dna @xcite .",
    "notice that the self - linking number does carry dependence on the frame .",
    "the mathematical concept of framing of a knot is intimately connected to the concept of regularization in field theory . in order to avoid the coincidence singularity in the two - point correlator @xmath64",
    ", we need to regularize it , say by point - splitting . evaluating , ` two - loop ' correlator of eqn.([twoloop ] ) , where the two loops are same , we face this same divergence , which , through framing , has been resolved by ` loop - splitting ' . ordinarily , quantities in field theory do depend on the regularization .",
    "like - wise the self - linking number here depends on the framing . but all those framing curves enveloping around the knot , which can be continuously deformed into each other without snapping the knot , form a topological class for which the self - linking number does not change . in field theory language",
    ", framing provides a _",
    "topological regularization_.    now collecting all these pieces of information , the expectation value of the wilson link operator for a link @xmath65 in the abelian chern - simons theory on @xmath0 can be written down in terms of the linking and self - linking ( framing ) numbers as : @xmath66 \\rangle   \\ = \\ exp \\left\\ { -   { \\frac{2\\pi i } { k } }   \\bigl [ \\sum_{\\ell}^s n_{\\ell } ^2 ~{\\cal sl}(k_\\ell ) + \\sum_{\\ell \\ne m}^s n_\\ell n_m { \\cal l}(k_\\ell ,   k_m ) \\bigr ] \\right\\}\\ ] ]    thus , we have indicated here how this simple field theory does indeed , through expectation values of wilson link operators , provide a field theoretic interpretation of some of the topological invariants , linking number and self - linking number of knots and links .",
    "non - abelian chern - simons theories are much richer in their structure ; these capture even more complex topological properties of knots and links .",
    "a non - abelian chern - simons theory , instead of being a gauge theory of one vector field , involves , say for gauge group @xmath2 , three such fields , @xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "these three are collectively written as a matrix valued vector field @xmath69 , where anti - hermetian matrices @xmath70 are the generators of the group @xmath2 .",
    "action functional defined in a three - manifold , say @xmath0 , is given by :    @xmath71\\ ] ]    like abelian chern - simons theory , this action has no metric dependence . besides a gauge invariance , it is also invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "the topological operators are the wilson loop ( knot ) operators defined as @xmath72~=~ tr_j p exp \\oint_k dx^\\mu a_{\\mu}^a t_j^a   \\label{wil}\\ ] ] for an oriented knot @xmath47 carrying spin @xmath73 representation reflected by the associated representation matrices @xmath74  @xmath75 .",
    "the symbol @xmath76 stands for path ordering of the exponential .",
    "this is done by breaking the length of the knot @xmath47 into infinitesimal intervals of size @xmath77 around the points labeled by the coordinates @xmath78 along the knot .",
    "then path ordered exponential is :    @xmath79\\ ] ]      these expectation values can be obtained non - perturbatively .",
    "for example , for knots and links carrying only the spin @xmath85 representations , witten has shown that the link invariants ( expectation values of the associated wilson link operators ) satisfy a simple relation .",
    "this relation is given for three link diagrams which are identical every where except for one crossing where they differ in that it is an over - crossing ( @xmath86 ) , or no - crossing ( @xmath87 ) or an under - crossing ( @xmath88 ) as shown in the figure below : 0.5 cm    0.5 cm    then the invariant for such links are related as : @xmath89 - q^{-1 } v_{1/2 } [ l_- ] \\",
    "= \\ ( q^{1/2 } - q^{-1/2 } ) ~v_{1/2 } [ l_0]\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is a root of unity related to the chern - simons coupling @xmath91 through the relation @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "this is precisely the well known generating skein relation for the jones polynomials .",
    "indeed @xmath93 $ ] , which is the expectation value of the wilson link operator where every component knot carries the doublet spin @xmath85 representation , is the one - variable jones polynomial .",
    "the above skein relation is powerful enough that it recursively yields jones polynomial for any arbitrary link .",
    "for example consider following three link diagrams :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    we use an important factorization property of these invariant : _ the link invariant of two distant ( disjoint ) links ( that is , with no mutual entanglement ) is simply the product of invariants for the individual links_. that is , for the link @xmath87 above , @xmath94   =   ( v_{1/2}[u])^2 $ ] , where symbol @xmath95 represents the unknot .",
    "then use of the skein relation yields : @xmath96 - q^{-1 } v_{1/2 } [ u ] \\ = \\ ( q^{1/2 } - q^{-1/2})~(v_{1/2}[u ] ) ^2\\ ] ] so that spin @xmath85 invariant for an unknot is given by : @xmath97   =   q^{1/2 } + q^{-1/2 } $ ] .",
    "next apply the skein relation to three links , where the @xmath98 is the right - handed hopf link , @xmath99 is simply the union of two ( unlinked ) unknots and @xmath87 is an unknot :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    this yields , the invariant for the right - handed hopf link @xmath44 as : @xmath100 \\ = \\ 1 + q^{-1 } +    q^{-2 } + q^{-3}$ ] .",
    "now use recursion relation for the three links :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    where @xmath86 is a right - handed trefoil ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath88 is an unknot and @xmath87 is a right - handed hopf @xmath102 .",
    "this gives us the invariant for the trefoil knot as @xmath103 \\ = \\ q^{-1/2 } + q^{-3/2 } +   q^{-5/2 } - q^{-9/2}$ ] .",
    "this way invariant for any arbitrary link can be recursively obtained .",
    "jones polynomial is in fact the simplest of the examples of a whole host of new link invariants that emerge naturally from this field theory .",
    "more general invariants are the expectation values of wilson link operators with arbitrary spin representations placed on the knots .",
    "the formalism does also allow for placing different representations on each of the component knots .",
    "this leads to so - called _ coloured polynomial invariants_. besides , instead of the gauge group @xmath2 , chern - simons theory based on any other semi - simple group can be used .",
    "these then yield even richer spectrum of the new invariants .",
    "while jones polynomial can be obtained by recursive use of the skein relation , other more general invariants ( for spin representations @xmath104 can _ not _ be obtained in this manner .",
    "of course there are generalizations of the skein relations for an arbitrary spin invariants .",
    "but these do not possess recursively complete solutions ( except for spin @xmath85 case above ) .",
    "therefore methods had to be developed to obtain expectation values of wilson operators with arbitrary representations living on the component knots of a link .",
    "one such method in its complete manifestations has been presented in ref @xcite .",
    "this allows us to present a complete and explicit solution of the chern - simons theory .",

    "the over - crossings and under - crossings of the strands are to be clearly marked .",
    "when all the strands are identical , we have ordinary braids .",
    "the theory of such braids , first developed by artin , is well studied .",
    "these braids form a group . however",
    ", we may wish to orient the individual strands and further distinguish them by putting different colours on them .",
    "these different colours are represented by different @xmath2 spins .",
    "these braids , unlike braids made from unoriented identical strands , have a more general structure than a group .",
    "these instead form a groupoid .",
    "the necessary aspects of the theory of such braids have been presented in ref.@xcite    one way of relating the braids to knots and links is through closure of braids .",
    "we obtain the closure of a braid by connecting the ends of the first , second , third , ..... strands from above to the ends of respective first , second , third , ..... strands from below as shown in ( a ) :    0.5 cm    0.5 cm    there is a theorem by alexander@xcite which states that _ any knot or link can be obtained as closure of a braid .",
    "_ this construction of a knot or link is not unique .",
    "there is another construction associated with braids which relates them to knots and links .",
    "this is called platting .",
    "consider a @xmath108-braid , with pairwise adjacent strands carrying the same colour and opposite orientations . then connect the @xmath109th strand with @xmath110th from above as well as from below .",
    "this yields the plat of the given braid as shown in ( b ) above .",
    "there is a theorem due to birman@xcite which relates plats to links .",
    "this states that _ a coloured - oriented link can be represented ( though not uniquely ) by the plat of an oriented - coloured @xmath108-braid_.    use of these two inputs , namely relation of chern - simons theory to the boundary wess - zumino conformal field theory and presentation of knots and links as closures or plats of braids leads to an explicit , complete and non - perturbative solution of the chern - simons theory .",
    "conformal field theory on associated boundary gives matrix representations for braids and platting or closing of a braid corresponds to taking a specific matrix element of these braid representations .",
    "this then yields the expectation value of the wilson link operator associated with that link .",
    "for example this invariant for an unknot @xmath95 carrying spin @xmath73 representation turns out to be :      the link invariants calculated from the field theory depend on the regularization used to define the coincident loop correlators , that is , the framing of the knots .",
    "the invariants above have been obtained in a specific framing called _",
    "standard framing_. in particular , the skein relation for spin @xmath85 invariants given above is in this framing . in this framing ,",
    "the self - linking ( framing ) number of every knot is zero .",
    "the invariants so obtained are unchanged under all the three reidemeister moves .",

    "there is another framing choice which has been of special interest . in this case , the frame is thought to be just vertically above the two dimensional projection of the knot . in this framing , known as _ vertical framing _ , reidemeister moves ii and iii do leave the link invariants unchanged , but reidemeister move i changes them .",
    "the general framework developed provides a powerful method of calculating knot and link invariants .",
    "this has in the process also provided answers to some of the open problems of knot theory .",
    "for example , one such problem is to find polynomial invariants which would discriminate between two chiralities of a given knot .",
    "the invariants for the mirror reflected knots are give by simple complex conjugation .",
    "up to ten crossing number , there are six chiral knots , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( as listed in the knot tables in rolfsen s book @xcite ) which are not distinguished from their mirror images by spin 1/2 ( jones ) polynomials .",
    "spin one ( kauffman / akutsu - wadati ) polynomials do detect the chirality of four of them , namely @xmath122 . but for @xmath123 both jones and kauffman polynomials are not changed under chirality transformation @xmath124 .",
    "however , the new spin @xmath125 invariants are powerful enough to distinguish these knots from their mirror images@xcite .    another problem of knot theory that has been provided with an answer is to do with so called _ mutant _ knots .",
    "a mutant of a knot or link is obtained in the following way : isolate a portion of the knot in such a way that it has two strands going into and two strands leaving from it .",
    "scoop it out and rotate it through @xmath126 about any of three orthogonal axes ( rotations about only two of these are really independent ) .",
    "glue it back after , if necessary , changing the orientations on the strands to match the free ends of strands of rest of the knot to which the free ends of the rotated portion are glued .",
    "this yields a mutant of the original knot .",
    "it has been possible to prove that polynomial invariants obtained from a chern - simons theory based on _ any arbitrary non - abelian gauge group _ do not distinguish isotopically inequivalent mutant knots@xcite . as an example consider the following sixteen crossing mutant knots :    0.4 cm    0.2 cm    the two knots are related by a mutation of the portion indicated by dashed enclosure .",
    "like all other mutants , the invariants obtained from any non - abelian chern - simons theory for them are identical .",
    "what is of particular interest about this pair is that one of them is chiral , other is not .",
    "this then yields an example of a chiral knot whose chirality can not be detected by any of these invariants .",
    "the general framework developed to study knots and links is also applicable to another set of gauge invariant operators called graphs . for @xmath2 chern - simons theory ,",
    "these are the graphs containing vertices with three legs .",
    "the edges of the graph between vertices carry wilson line operators .",
    "more general gauge invariant operators which include links attached to the edges of graphs can also be evaluated in this framework .",

    "this is one of the rare quantum field theories which can be explicitly and non - perturbatively solved . while abelian chern - simons theory provides a simple description of linking and self - linking numbers of a link , non",
    "- abelian theories are even richer . for every representation of any non - abelian gauge group",
    ", there is a new link invariant .",
    "jones polynomial associated with spin @xmath85 representation in an @xmath2 chern - simons theory , is the simplest example of such link invariants .",
    "even more general invariants ( _ coloured invariants _ ) are obtained if we place different representations on the component knots .",
    "the framework is rich enough to discuss the knots and links not only in simple manifold like @xmath6 or @xmath0 , but any arbitrary three - manifold .",
    "chern - simons partition function is a particularly interesting three - manifold invariant for which a simple and efficient computational method is available now .",
    "perturbative studies of chern - simons theory have given a new framework for describing vassiliev invariants .",
    "in the process of developing this framework for knot theory , new representations of braids also have been obtained .",
    "the close connection that braids have with yang - baxter equation , has provided methods of obtaining a variety of new exactly solvable two - dimensional statistical mechanical models in physics@xcite .",
    "these models are the higher vertex generalizations of the six - vertex model of lieb and wu and 19-vertex model of zamolodchikov and fateev .",
    "chern - simons field theories are also of direct interest in other areas of physics .",
    "one area where these have found profound application is quantum gravity .",
    "three - dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant , itself a topological field theory , is essentially described by two @xmath2 chern - simons theories .",
    "micro - states of a black hole in the four dimensional spin - polymer gravity can also be modeled by a chern - simons theory .",
    "this allows an exact computation of black hole entropy going beyond the semi - classical result .",
    "these calculations so far have been done for non - rotating black holes only .",
    "these need to be extended for charged and rotating black holes , which requires certain amount of technical work .",
    "further , while an exact formula for quantum entropy of a non - rotating black hole has been derived , a similar exact formula for the expectation value of the area operator in the chern - simons approach is not known .",
    "also , a satisfactory understanding of hawking radiation in this picture is yet to be developed .",
    "string theory is another interesting framework in which black hole entropy has been analyzed in recent times .",
    "though it provides a fundamental quantum description , unfortunately , calculations in this theory can be done for extremal or near extremal black holes only .",
    "these despite their mathematical interest are not astrophysically realistic .",
    "in particular , black holes of interest such as a schwarzschild black hole are not generally amenable to analysis in this approach . also supersymmetry plays an important role in the string picture .",
    "in contrast , modeling of micro - states of a black hole by an effective chern - simons theory is not limited by the constraint of extremality or near extremality .",
    "this framework handles the curved geometry of the black hole directly without invoking supersymmetry .",
    "there are other topological quantum field theories also .",
    "one particularly interesting class is so called _ cohomological field theories_. these are the field theoretical interpretations of four - manifold invariants obtained by s. donaldson in 1983 .",
    "his work is an example of developments in mathematics which have made critical use of some of the notions of physics @xcite .",
    "his theory provides an understanding of the geometry in four dimensions through self - dual and anti - self - dual yang - mills gauge fields known to physicists as ` instantons and anti - instantons ' .",
    "five years later , e. witten provided a quantum field theoretical framework for donaldsons s work in terms of a four dimensional topological yang - mills gauge field theory@xcite .",
    "this field theory has certain kind of twisted supersymmetry .",
    "donaldson invariants are given as the correlation functions in this field theory . in recent years , this area has registered even further boost through the work of seiberg and witten @xcite .",
    "these developments use the powerful electric - magnetic duality to relate the cohomological field theory based on gauge group @xmath2 to that based on @xmath227 .",
    "this brings in completely new insights into this area and makes calculation of donaldson four manifold invariants rather easy .",
