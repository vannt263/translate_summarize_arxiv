    "red giant and super - giant stars of late - m spectral class often exhibit sio masers in their extended atmospheres .",
    "these masers are strongly variable over time scales of @xmath11  y. sio maser emission emanates from a typical radius of @xmath12  au ( @xcite ) , which corresponds to @xmath13  mas at the assumed 8.0  kpc distance of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "as our measurements were made over a time - span much longer than the stellar cycle , we can not track individual maser features , and we accept an intrinsic stellar position uncertainty of about @xmath14  mas owing to possible variations across the maser shell . for a late - type super - giant ,",
    "the stellar radius is considerably larger than for a red giant of similar spectral class , and its sio masers are found at radii roughly an order of magnitude larger .",

    "sio masers are likely detectable over a very wide range of velocities , probably exceeding 700  . however , wide - band observations at the vla are currently severely limited by the correlator . in order to obtain adequate spectral resolution and sensitivity , we chose to limit our velocity coverage and observe in seven 6.25  mhz bands ( each covering @xmath15  excluding band edges ) .",
    "we observed in both right and left circular polarization for each band and obtained 64 spectral channels per band , resulting in uniformly weighted spectral channel spacings of about 98  khz or 0.67  .",

    "we observed by cycling among bands centered at lsr velocities of @xmath18 ; the latter six bands covered the lsr velocity range @xmath19  with only two small gaps .",
    "this setup allowed for deeper integrations for the previously known , or suspected , sio maser stars than would be possible for a `` wide - open '' search .",
    "initial calibration of the vla data was done in a standard manner recommended by the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) documentation .",
    "the flux density scale was based on observations of 3c  286 , assuming 1.49  jy for interferometer baselines shorter than 300  k@xmath20 .",
    "amplitude and bandpass calibration was accomplished with observations of nrao  530 , which had a flux density of 2.8  jy during the 2006 observations .",

    "however , this is unlikely to shift the measured position of the masers significantly , as the positions are determined almost entirely by the phase data .",
    "we searched for new maser stars by making very large images , covering about @xmath22 , or most of the primary beam of an individual vla antenna at 43 ghz , about .",
    "this was done by limiting the range of uv - data used and resulted in maps with a nearly circular beam of 0.15 .",

    "we include the results from the 1995 vla observations reported in paper i , the 1998 and 2000 vla observations reported in paper ii , and the 2006 results reported in this paper . since stellar sio masers are variable in strength over the period of the stellar pulsation and the sensitivity of each epoch s data differed somewhat , only the stronger sources are detected at all epochs .",
    "one of the stars , irs  7 , is a super - giant . as discussed in paper  ii , it has sio maser features spread over @xmath26  and is highly variable .",
    "we would expect its stronger sio maser peaks could be spread over a region of at least @xmath27  mas .",

    "since the estimated uncertainties for individual east - west and north - south positions were neither identical , nor exactly linearly related , we chose a single , average reference epoch for each star ( instead of a separate reference epoch for the east - west and north - south directions ) , which resulted in slight parameter correlations .    assuming a distance of 8.0  kpc to the galactic center @xcite , we convert proper motions to linear velocities and , with the radial velocities , determine the full 3-dimensional speed , @xmath30 , of each star with respect to .",
    "these speeds are given in table  [ table : enclosed_masses ] . while the speeds on the plane of the sky are directly referenced to , the speeds along our line - of - sight",

    "near - ir observations were obtained on the 8.2-m ut4 ( yepun ) of the eso - vlt on cerro paranal , chile , using the detector system naos / conica ( hereafter naco ) consisting of the adaptive optics system naos @xcite and the @xmath31-pixel near - ir camera conica @xcite .",
    "we obtained 8 data sets in h and k bands with a scale of 27 mas / pixel ( large scale ) covering 5 epochs ( may 2002 , may 2003 , june 2004 , may 2005 , april 2006 ) .",
    "each image covers a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath32 arcsec . during each observation",
    "the camera pointing was shifted so that the total fov of a complete data set was between @xmath33 and @xmath34  arcsec , centered on . in all cases",
    "the spatial resolution was ( nearly ) diffraction limited , leading to a typical fwhm of @xmath35 mas .",
    "typical limiting magnitudes were 18@xmath36  mag at k band and 20@xmath36 mag at h band .",
    "all images were sky - subtracted , bad - pixel removed and flat - field corrected . in order to obtain the best signal - to - noise ratios and maximum fov coverages in single maps , we combined all good - quality images belonging to the same data set to mosaics after correcting for instrumental geometric distortion .",
    "details of the distortion correction will be given in @xcite .    in order to establish an astrometric near - ir reference frame ,",
    "we selected one high - quality mosaic ( may 2005 ) , extracted image positions for all detected stars and transformed them into astrometric coordinates using the positions of all 9 maser stars in the fov interpolated to the epoch of the image . to compare positions among images of different epochs , we chose an ensemble of @xmath37 `` well - behaved '' stars ( stars that are well - separated from neighbors and are bright but not saturated ) in the `` master mosaic '' and computed in each image all stellar positions relative to this ensemble . due to varying fovs , the number of stars usable for a given mosaic varied between about 400 to 600 .    in each image , positions were extracted by fitting stars with 2-dimensional elliptical gaussian brightness distributions . although over the entire fov significant departures from isoplanicity occur , this effect elongates the stellar psfs symmetrically and does not affect significantly the centroids of gaussian - fitted positions .",
    "proper motions were computed by fitting the positions versus times with straight lines .",
    "to assure statistically `` clean '' errors for the proper motions , outlier rejection and error rescaling were applied where possible .",
    "this led to typical position accuracies of @xmath0  mas and typical proper motion accuracies of @xmath1  . unfortunately",
    ", this accuracy was not achieved for all maser stars , as some are very bright stars and are affected by detector non - linearity / saturation in some images ; also the star most distant from  ( irs19nw ) was observed only in the last two epochs .",
    "thus , some of the maser stars have errors larger than typical .",
    "the proper motions of stars in the galactic center cluster , measured from infrared images , are _ relative _ motions only .",
    "one can add an arbitrary constant vector to all of the stellar proper motions without violating observational constraints .",
    "until now , the `` zero points '' of the motions have been determined by assuming isotropy and removing the average motion of the entire sample . since the radio proper motions are inherently in a reference frame tied directly to",
    ", one can use any one of the sio stars , or the mean motion of a group of them , to place the infrared proper motions in s frame .",
    "we have measured radio positions and proper motions , relative to , for the nine bright sio maser stars that appear on the naco images ( ie , within @xmath26  of ) .",
    "the position and proper motion accuracies typically are @xmath11  mas and @xmath38  , respectively .",
    "this allows us to align the radio and infrared frames , both in position and in proper motion .",
    "thus , not only can the location of  can be accurately determined on infrared images , but also stellar proper motions from infrared data can be referenced directly to , without assumptions of isotropy or homogeneity of the stellar motions .    the radio and infrared proper motions measured for the nine stars are listed in table  [ table : motion_alignment ] .",
    "the nine stars have weighted mean differences ( and standard errors of the means ) of @xmath39  toward the east , and @xmath40  toward the north .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those published in paper ii .",
    "quantitatively , the differences between the ir motions of paper ii and this paper for some stars ( notably irs 12n ) are greater than expected based on the quoted uncertainties . since the ir motions in paper ii were based on 2 epochs only , which did not allow for an internal check on the formal motion uncertainties , we believe those uncertainties were somewhat optimistic",
    ".    currently only one star , irs  7 , has a significant discrepancy between the radio and infrared motions in the both coordinates .",
    "this is the only super - giant star in the sample and , owing to its extreme brightness , the infrared measurements are compromised by detector saturation .",
    "additionally , the radio measurements are subject to significant uncertainty from the large sio maser shell size . after removing irs  7 ,",
    "the weighted mean differences between the radio and ir motions change only slightly and become @xmath41  toward the east , and @xmath42  toward the north .",
    "when comparing how well the ir frame matches the radio frame , we need to consider the statistical uncertainty of the average ir motion , which has been removed . for most epochs ,",
    "the average motion is based on @xmath43 stars , each of which has a typical motion of @xmath44  .",
    "thus , the mean ir motion should have an uncertainty of roughly @xmath45  . adopting the result with irs  7 removed , converting to linear speeds for a distance of 8.0  kpc to the galactic center @xcite , and adding in quadrature a @xmath46   uncertainty for the mean ir motion removed from each coordinate ,",
    "implies that the infrared stellar cluster moves @xmath47  toward the east , and @xmath48  toward the north , with respect to .",
    "the northward component motion does not deviate significantly from zero ; the eastward component formally presents a @xmath49 significance . combining these components in quadrature",
    "formally yields a speed difference of @xmath50  .",
    "however , at this time , we do not consider that we have firmly detected motion of the stellar cluster , and we adopt a @xmath51 upper limit of @xmath2   for the proper motion of the stellar cusp with respect to .",
    "estimates of the enclosed mass versus projected radius from , based on infrared stellar motions , rely on _ relative _ motions not tied directly to . since , the 3-dimensional motions of the sio masers in this paper are both very accurate and directly tied to , they provide valuable information on the enclosed mass within projected radii of 0.2 to 2 pc of .    in paper ii ,",
    "we derived a lower limit to the enclosed mass at the projected radius of each star , assuming the stellar motions reflect gravitational orbits dominated by a central point mass . given the 3-dimensional speed , @xmath30 , and projected distance from , @xmath52 , for each star , we obtained a strict lower limit to the mass enclosed , @xmath53 , within the true radius , @xmath54 , of that star from . for a given enclosed mass , semi - major axis and eccentricity ( @xmath55 ) , the greatest orbital speed occurs at pericenter for @xmath56 .",
    "since the _ projected _ pericenter distance can not exceed the true distance , we obtained @xmath57 note that this enclosed mass limit is a factor of two lower than would be obtained for a circular orbit .",
    "this lower limit approaches an equality only when three criteria are met : 1 ) @xmath58 , 2 ) the star is near pericenter , and 3 ) it has an eccentricity near unity .",
    "the _ a priori _ chance of any star satisfying all three of these criteria is small , especially since a star in a highly eccentric orbit spends very little time near pericenter .",
    "thus , eq .  ( 1 ) provides a very conservative limit on enclosed mass .",
    "we evaluate the lower limit to @xmath53 using eq .  1 by adopting conservatively the smallest total velocity allowed by measurement uncertainties , by subtracting @xmath51 from @xmath30 in table  [ table : enclosed_masses ] before calculating a mass limit .",
    "the mass limits , given in table  [ table : enclosed_masses ] , are mostly consistent with the enclosed mass versus projected distance from  given by @xcite and @xcite . for many of the stars ,",
    "the lower mass limits are well below the estimated enclosed mass curves , as expected given the very conservative nature of the calculated limits .",
    "our most significant lower mass limit is from irs  9 . in paper ii",
    ", we arrived at a limit @xmath59  , which exceeded the then favored model of a @xmath60   black hole @xcite , plus a @xmath61  contribution from the central stellar cluster @xcite , by about 50% . with our improved proper motions",
    ", we now find a more stringent limit of @xmath62  at a projected radius of 0.33 pc from .",
    "[ fig : enclosed_mass ] displays our enclosed mass versus radius constraint based on the 3-dimension motion of irs  9 , along with other constraints in the recent literature . the current best estimate for the mass of the smbh ( ) is @xmath63  , for the distance to the galactic center , @xmath64 , of @xmath65  kpc .",
    "this mass estimate comes from an unweighted average of the results of @xcite and @xcite , based on stellar orbit determinations . adding in a @xmath61  contribution from the central stellar cluster , based on a density profile of @xmath66  pc@xmath67 by @xcite , yields @xmath68  , still leaving a discrepancy of @xmath69  , for @xmath70  kpc .",
    "formally , this is about a @xmath71 discrepancy , assuming an uncertainty of @xmath72  in the mass estimate of  and an estimated @xmath73% uncertainty in the mass of the stellar cusp .",
    "since we do not know the line - of - sight distance of irs  9 from , one might be tempted to argue that @xmath74 and the star is simply sensing an enclosed mass of @xmath75   from the central stellar cluster at that radius .",
    "however , the mass limit derived from eq .",
    "( 1 ) scales as @xmath54 and would be approximately @xmath76  for @xmath77  pc .",

    "[ fig : enclosed_mass ] ( but see  5.2 ) .    how can the lower limit to the enclosed mass provided by irs  9 be explained ?",
    "we now discuss some possibilities .",
    "one could explain the motion of irs  9 , were the central stellar cluster to contain dark matter ( in addition to ) whose mass exceeds @xmath69  within @xmath79  pc .",
    "@xcite estimates that @xmath80   of `` dark '' stellar remnants ( eg , white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes ) could have accumulated in the inner few tenths of a parsec of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite show that , with data available at the time , the orbital fit of star s2 allows for ( but does not require ) @xmath81  of dark matter distributed within 0.001  pc of .",
    "should such a dark component exist and extend to greater radii , it might explain some of the irs  9 mass discrepancy .",
    "however , other estimates of the total mass in black holes in the central few tenths of a pc do not exceed @xmath82   @xcite .",
    "given these estimates and the evidence from other enclosed mass indicators that do not support @xmath80  of dark matter within @xmath0  pc of  @xcite , it seems unlikely that a dark component could explain more than a modest fraction of the irs  9 mass discrepancy .      a critical assumption for calculating the minimum enclosed mass using irs  9 s space velocity ( eq .",
    "1 ) is that it is in a bound orbit dominated by a central point mass .",
    "if irs  9 is in a highly eccentric orbit with a semimajor axis greater than a few parsecs , this assumption can break down .",
    "in such a case , the star s space velocity could exceed the `` local '' escape velocity , based on the mass enclosed at its current radius , but still be bound at a larger radius .",
    "for example , a star could be bound by mass within @xmath83  pc of , but observed plunging into the inner few tenths of a parsec at a speed that makes it appear unbound .",
    "this could happen via gravitational scattering starting either at small radii and increasing orbital energy or at large radii and removing angular momentum .",
    "@xcite suggest a similar explanation for three oh / ir stars with large radial velocities ; these stars are seen projected tens of parsecs from  and would require semimajor axes of a few kpc .",

    "thus , if irs  9 is in a highly eccentric orbit that takes it out to a radius of @xmath110  pc , it could achieve its very high observed 3-d velocity without violating the enclosed masses estimated by other methods .    a priori it might seem very unlikely that even one of 15 stars with detectable sio masers would have such an orbit and be observed near closest approach to  ( where it spends little time ) .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate the likelihood , especially with the limited statistics available at this time .      were the mass of  @xmath112  , no mass discrepancy would exist .",
    "the best current mass estimates are based on fitting orbits for many stars and should be robust .",

    "we estimate that the stellar radial velocity of irs  9 has changed by less than 2  over 8 years . also , the proper motion components are well - fit by constant velocities , with @xmath51 upper limits to accelerations of 0.4 and 0.6 mas y@xmath132 ( 15 and 23  y@xmath133 at 8.0  kpc ) for the eastward and northward components , respectively",
    ".    the observed changes in radial velocity ( or proper motion components ) would have different characteristics depending on the relative values of the time span of the observations , @xmath134 , and the orbital period , @xmath135 .",
    "for @xmath136 , we would have sampled large changes in the orbital mean anomaly and hence would have seen quasi - random changes of magnitude equal to the orbital speed . our limit of @xmath8  change in the radial velocity over 8 y , would place a limit of @xmath137  for the radial component of any orbital velocity .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath138 , then we could be sampling only a small portion of an orbit and detecting a velocity change might be difficult .",
    "however , setting @xmath139  y requires @xmath140  y. since any bright companion for irs  9 would have been observed , we adopt companion mass @xmath141 of @xmath142  .",
    "this would even allow for most black hole companions .",
    "for @xmath143  and @xmath140  y , we find an upper limit for an orbital speed of @xmath144  .",
    "thus , a binary orbital contribution to the observed space velocity of irs  9 could not exceed @xmath26  and likely would be considerably less .",
    "thus , it is highly unlikely that the extreme velocity of irs  9 could be explained as owing to a binary orbit .",
    "could irs  9 have been in a binary system and come unbound ( or bound at a much larger radius as discussed in  5.2 ) after a close encounter with ?",
    "a small number of `` hyper - velocity '' stars are thought to have been ejected from the galactic center in this manner @xcite . however , these are estimated to be very rare events ( @xmath24 in @xmath145 y ) and we are statistically unlikely to be witnessing a newly created hyper - velocity star so close to .",
    "all hyper - velocity stars discovered to date are early - type main - sequence stars ; they are found in the outer galaxy and are moving at speeds of @xmath146  , even after climbing out of the gravitational potential of the inner galaxy .",
    "main sequence stars can survive the strong tidal forces experienced during close encounters with .",
    "however , irs  9 is an agb star and , thus , is a very extended ( @xmath147 solar radii ) and low surface - gravity object .",
    "it is unclear if such a star could survive the ejection event , without losing its extended atmosphere .",
    "we have now measured the radio positions and proper motions of 15 late type stars with sio maser emission in the galactic center stellar cluster .",
    "all but two of these stars have been detected at three or more epochs and have measurement accuracies of @xmath0  mas in position and @xmath1  in proper motion .",
    "nine of these stars have multi - epoch measurements of proper motions at infrared wavelengths .",
    "a comparison of the radio motions , which are relative to , with the infrared motions indicates that the stellar cusp moves with   to within 45  .    the three - dimensional speeds and projected distances of individual stars from  yield lower limits to the enclosed mass .",
    "the enclosed mass limit for one star , irs  9 , exceeds current estimates of the combined mass of  and the luminous stars in the cusp within the central parsec .",
    "this result is puzzling , but might be explained , for example , by a combination of i ) a population of dark stellar remnants in the central parsec , ii ) irs  9 being on a plunging `` orbit '' with a semimajor axis @xmath148  pc , and/or iii ) a value of @xmath149  kpc .",
