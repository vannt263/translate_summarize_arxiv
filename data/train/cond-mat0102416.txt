    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in trapped dilute gases of bosonic atoms @xcite triggered a wide spread interest in the field of ultracold atomic gases .",
    "meanwhile these systems appear as a unique lab for the study of all kinds of fundamental quantum phenomena .    after a series of excellent experiments on bosonic systems",
    "the question arises , whether a dilute gas of fermionic atoms can also be cooled to temperatures where quantum effects dominate . in 1999",
    "the group of deborah jin managed to cool a sample of typically @xmath0 fermionic @xmath1k atoms to temperatures significantly below the fermi energy of the system @xcite ; in recent experiments they achieved a temperature corresponding to one fifth of the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "in this temperature regime the system can be described as a degenerate fermi gas , where the majority of the atoms successively fills the lowest available one - body states according to the pauli principle .",
    "one of the goals of the investigations on dilute and ultracold fermi gases is the observation of cooper pairing and the transition to a superfluid state .",
    "the transition temperature depends on the density and on the strength of the attractive interaction that is necessary for the formation of cooper pairs @xcite . in order to increase the transition temperature",
    "one may increase the density or the interaction strength , where the latter seems to be more promising .",
    "an atomic species favored for the experimental observation of a bcs transition is @xmath2li due to its large s - wave scattering length of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "but also @xmath1k , which shows a rather small natural scattering length , is a possible candidate for cooper pair formation @xcite , because a simultaneous s- and p - wave feshbach resonance is predicted @xcite , which allows tuning of the s- and p - wave scattering lengths over a very wide range .",
    "a serious constraint on the way towards a superfluid fermi gas is the mechanical stability of the progenitor , i.e. , the normal degenerate fermi gas .",
    "as was experimentally demonstrated for the bosonic @xmath4rb system @xcite , an attractive interaction between the atoms leads to a mean - field instability of the trapped gas if the density exceeds a critical value .",
    "a similar collapse is expected in fermionic systems with attractive interactions .",
    "in contrast to the bosonic systems p - wave interactions contribute in a fermi gas and may have strong influence on the stability of the system @xcite .    in the following we address the question of the stability of degenerate one- and two - component fermi gases in presence of s- and p - wave interactions within a simple and transparent model . in section [ sec : eci ] we derive an effective contact interaction ( eci ) for all partial waves that is suited for a mean - field treatment of the many - body problem . using the s- and p - wave part of this interaction we construct in section [ sec : ef ] the energy functional of a trapped multi - component fermi gas in thomas - fermi approximation . from that the ground state density profile can be determined by functional variation . in section [ sec:1comp ]",
    "we discuss the structure and stability of single - component fermi gases , where only the p - wave interaction contributes according to the pauli principle .",
    "section [ sec:2comp ] deals with two - component fermi gases where s- and p - wave interactions are present and lead to a subtle dependence of the stability on the two scattering lengths .",
    "the approximate solution of the many - body problem in a restricted low - momentum sub - space of the full hilbert space faces a fundamental problem : many realistic two - body interactions  like van - der - waals - type interactions between atoms or the interactions between two nucleons in an atomic nucleus  exhibit a strong short - range repulsion .",
    "this repulsion generates particular short - range correlations in the many - body state , which can not be described within a low - momentum model - space @xcite .",
    "therefore short - range correlations inhibit the use of a realistic two - body interactions in the framework of a naive mean - field model .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to replace the original interaction by a suitable effective interaction .",
    "how this effective interaction has to be constructed from the original potential depends on the properties of the actual physical system under investigation .",
    "cold and very dilute quantum gases allow an effective interaction of simple structure .",
    "the typical wave length of the relative motion of two particles is always large compared to the range of the interaction .",
    "therefore the particles experience only an `` averaged '' two - body potential and do not probe the detailed radial dependence .",
    "moreover the gases are in a metastable not self - bound state that is kept together by the external trapping potential .",
    "thus the bound states of the two - body potential are not populated and have only indirect influence . we make",
    "use of these facts and replace the original potential by a contact interaction . the strength of the contact terms is related to the properties of the original potential .    we establish this relation via the energy spectrum of the two - body system .",
    "consider a two - body problem with an auxiliary boundary condition at some large radius such that the spectrum is discrete even for positive energies . for noninteracting particles this spectrum shows a sequence of levels at positive energies @xmath5 which are labeled by an angular momentum quantum number @xmath6 and a radial quantum number @xmath7 .",
    "a schematic sketch of this spectrum for some fixed @xmath6 is shown in figure [ fig : eci_spectrumschematic ] .",
    "if we switch on an interaction between the particles two things happen : a number @xmath8 of bound two - body states with relative angular momentum @xmath6 may appear at negative energies and the levels at positive energies @xmath9 are shifted compared to the noninteracting spectrum . for our purpose",
    "this energy - shift @xmath10 is defined between the positive energy states only .",
    "the lowest level of positive energy is labeled with the quantum number @xmath11 .     with the energy spectrum @xmath9 in presence of a two - body interaction for",
    "given relative angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the interaction generates @xmath8 bound states and shifts the positive energy states by @xmath12 . ]",
    "the energy - shift is the relevant `` averaged '' property of the two - body potential that the effective interaction should reproduce .",
    "we require that the expectation value of the effective interaction calculated with eigenstates @xmath13 of the noninteracting two - body problem equal the energy shift @xmath12 induced by the original potential @xmath14 due to the angular momentum dependence of the energy - shifts we have to construct the effective contact interaction as a sum of contact interaction for each partial wave .",
    "the strength of each contact term is fixed by this condition .",
    "the construction of the effective contact interaction ( eci ) is organized in two steps : firstly , the two - body energy - shift induced by the original potential is evaluated .",
    "secondly , the operator of the effective contact interaction is formulated for each partial wave and the interaction strengths are fixed by condition .",
    "assume a system of two particles with reduced mass @xmath15 .",
    "their wave function can be decomposed into a center of mass and a relative wave function , where the latter separates into a radial and a angular component because of rotational symmetry @xmath16 the radial wave functions @xmath17 of the noninteracting two - body system are solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath18 r_{nl}(r ) = 0\\ ] ] ( we use units with @xmath19 ) .",
    "we require the radial wave function to vanish at some arbitrary but large radius @xmath20 @xmath21 this auxiliary boundary condition leads to a discrete energy spectrum , which is needed to enumerate the energy levels and to evaluate the energy shift .    in the noninteracting case",
    "the solution of the radial schrdinger equation is given by a spherical bessel function @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the relative momentum of the two particles and @xmath25 a normalization constant .",
    "the discrete momenta @xmath24 are determined by the boundary condition and thus are related the to the zeros of the bessel function . since the radius @xmath20 can be chosen arbitrary large it is sufficient to use the asymptotic expansions of the spherical bessel and neumann functions @xmath26 evaluating the boundary condition with the asymptotic form of the bessel function we obtain for the possible relative momenta @xmath27 accordingly the two - body energy spectrum in the noninteracting case is given by @xmath28 the normalization constant can be determined explicitly @xmath29 inserting the asymptotic form of the bessel function we finally get @xmath30 in presence of a two - body potential @xmath31 of finite range @xmath32 the solution @xmath33 of schrdinger equation @xmath34 \\bigg ]     \\bar{r}_{nl}(r ) = 0\\ ] ] outside the range of the potential ( @xmath35 ) is given by a superposition of spherical bessel and neumann functions @xmath36 , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes the phase shift of the potential for the @xmath6-th partial wave .",

    "first we look at typical wave functions to which the idea of the eci applies .",
    "the major condition is that the typical wavelength of the relative motion is large compared to the range of the interaction .",
    "this is ensured by choosing the radius @xmath32 of the square - well much smaller than the radius @xmath20 associated with the boundary condition ; in the following we use @xmath99 .",

    "only the wavelength is changed slightly due to the different matching to the wave function in the interior ( see insert of figure [ fig : eci_rectwell_wavefunc ] ) .",
    "this change of the relative momentum translates immediately into an energy shift . from that picture",

    "the insert in figure [ fig : eci_rectwell_wavefunc ] shows that the wave functions behave very different within the range @xmath32 due to the different potential depths .",
    "moreover the potentials have a different number of bound states , e.g. , the thick solid curve is associated with a potential with one bound state but zero phase shift .",
    "hence the behavior outside the potential is identical to the noninteracting case ( thin solid curve ) and the energy shift is zero .     obtained from the exact @xmath61 solutions plotted versus the strength @xmath101 of the square - well potential .",

    "a characteristic pattern appears : in the vicinity of interaction strengths where the potential gains another bound state the relative energy shift assumes large positive and negative values .",
    "large positive energy shifts occur for potentials that have a very weakly bound state , negative energy shifts for those that have an almost bound state . in between these interaction strengths extended plateaus of nearly constant energy shift appear . within the plateaus",
    "the energy shift is independent of the radial quantum number @xmath7 of the level or the relative momentum .",
    "this is a special property of the s - wave channel ; for higher partial waves the relative energy shift is proportional to @xmath105 . only at the edges of the plateaus a slight dependence on the relative momentum shows up ( see figure [ fig : eci_rectwell_energyshift ] ) .",
    "this structure is closely related to the behavior of the s - wave scattering length .",
    "the @xmath61 energy shift induced by the eci in scattering length approximation is proportional to the scattering length @xmath94 . for the square - well potential",
    "we get @xmath106 this eci energy shift is right on top of the solid curve in figure [ fig : eci_rectwell_energyshift ] , i.e. , it agrees very well with the exact energy shift for the lowest positive energy state . even for higher",

    "we expect that the agreement gets worse if either the relative momentum or if the scattering length is large .",
    "therefore , figure [ fig : eci_energydeviation ] shows the relative energy deviation for @xmath61 and @xmath71 states as function of the product of momentum and scattering length , @xmath111 , which was assumed to be small in order to introduce the scattering length .",
    "the different curves correspond to different values of the momentum @xmath24 and were obtained by varying the depth of the square - well potential and thus the scattering length .",
    "as expected the deviation increases with increasing value of @xmath111 .",
    "nevertheless , the deviation of the energy calculated with the eci in scattering length approximation is below 1% up to rather large values of @xmath112 .",
    "if we tolerate a maximum deviation of 5% then the scattering length formulation can be used up to values @xmath113 .",
    "it should be noted that the relative deviation of the general form of the eci in the parameter range discussed above is below @xmath114 .",
    "thus all approximations made to obtain equation are valid on a high level of accuracy .",
    "the restrictions on the validity of the scattering length formulation originate for the replacement of the phase shifts by the scattering length alone , which is no inherent part of th eci concept .",
    "if the simple scattering length formulation is not sufficient for a special application one can go beyond that .    for example , the inclusion of effective volume corrections ( see eq . ) improves the agreement with the exact energy shifts . in this way we can reduce the maximum deviation to only 1% up to @xmath115 .",
    "the idea to simulate the effect of a complicated finite - range two - body potential by a simple s - wave contact interaction dates back to e. fermi @xcite and was used by several authors @xcite in various physical contexts .",

    "will always lead to an absolute stabilization , i.e. , there is no collapse for arbitrary large particle number despite of the s - wave attraction .",
    "we will study these special effects in detail in the following section .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that it is necessary to include the p - wave interaction if the scattering length @xmath277 is roughly in the same order of magnitude as the s - wave scattering length .",
    "even if the ratio of the scattering lengths , @xmath278 , is approximately 0.3 dramatic effects like the p - wave stabilization , which is discussed in the next section , can occur . as can be seen from figure [ fig:2comp_stabmap ] the p - wave interaction",

    "due to density fluctuations this state may undergo a transition to the energetically preferred equilibrium state , which includes the high - density phase .",
    "the physical origin of the high - density phase is quite intuitive : the usual stability is determined by a competition between kinetic energy , which favors low densities , and attractive mean - field , which prefers higher densities .",

    "for even weaker p - wave interactions with @xmath304 @xmath182 can be negative .",
    "that means that the high - density solution forms a self - bound state independent of the trapping potential .",
