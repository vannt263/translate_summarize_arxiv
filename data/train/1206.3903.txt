    "* two tetrads @xmath34 and @xmath35 related by a local lorentz transformation define the same metric and are gauge - equivalent . are nt then the field , and the minkowski tetrad , which define the same metric , gauge - equivalent in this sense ?",
    "the answer is no , because a ( proper orthochronus ) lorentz transformation does not change the direction of time .",
    "accordingly , the quantity detected by the fermion clock and not coded into the metric , is lorentz - invariant . in fact , there are two signs which are not modified by a lorentz transformation : the direction of time and the parity of space",
    ". these are modified , respectively , by time reversal @xmath36 and parity @xmath37 .",
    "therefore there are _ two _ signs that are invariant , corresponding to the four connected components of the full lorentz group .",
    "these are captured for instance by the sign of the lapse @xmath38 and the sign of the determinant of the tetrad , @xmath39 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that fermion dynamics is affected by both . in this paper , for simplicity , we focus on the sign of the lapse , and assume @xmath40 , mentioning the @xmath41 only briefly . in this case , the sign @xmath42 of @xmath43 reflects the sign of the lapse .",
    "the negative - lapse region of the gravitational field is extended all over spacetime .",
    "we learn more about the physics of these regions by considering a region which is confined in space . as and example , consider the gravitational field e^0=d f(t , x ) ,  e^i = dx^i [ ee ] where @xmath44 is a smooth function whose @xmath27 derivative is negative in some bounded region .",

    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ regioni ] illustrates the three regions for @xmath49    , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath48 takes the same value ( @xmath49 ) . ]    the spin - connection of the field vanishes , therefore its spacetime has vanishing curvature : it follows that locally this spacetime is minkowski space .",
    "but in this case spacetime is not globally minkowski . in fact",
    ", the map from this spacetime and minkowski space in minkowski coordinates @xmath52 is given by t_m = f(x , t ) [ map ] but @xmath53 is not injective .",
    "the three regions @xmath54 , @xmath51 and @xmath50 are mapped onto the same region @xmath55 of minkowski space by .",
    "the geometry defined by the gravitational field is that of a trouser s pocket : outside these three regions , spacetime is globally isomorphic to minkowski space ; each of the three regions is itself flat as well , but they are joined in such a way that @xmath55 is replaced by three regions with the same geometry as @xmath55 : region @xmath54 is glued to the past , region @xmath51 is glued to the future , and region @xmath50 is glued to region @xmath54 and region @xmath51 , as in fig .",
    "[ tasca ] .",
    "now , the dirac equation can be easily solved wit this gravitational field .",
    "a solution with four - momentum @xmath56 is ( x , t)=e^ip_i _ q^(x , t)e^i  _ o where the integral is a line integral from an arbitrary fixed spacetime point @xmath57 to the point @xmath58 . the result does not depend on the path , because of the vanishing of @xmath59 . for the field , this gives ( x , t)=e^ip_0f(x , t)+ip_ix^i  _ o we see immediately that the fermion dynamics outside the three regions is unaffected , since this is the standard solution in minkowski coordinates : a solution on minkowski space remains a solution on this field .",
    "futhermore , the solution inside the region @xmath54 is equal to the solution inside the region @xmath51 and is the time reversed of the solution inside the negative - lapse region @xmath50 . in other words , the fermion crosses the pocket as if only region @xmath54 existed .",
    "a pendulum at the origin , instead , would measure the time that takes into account the duration of all the three regions .",
    "notice that causal behavior of the propagation is nontrivial : a fermion wave packet entering the region @xmath54 travels ahead in time in region @xmath54 , then backward in time with respect to the sign of the lapse in region @xmath50 , and then again forward in time in region @xmath51 and since .",
    "this propagation is always consistent with the global causal structure defined by the metric .",
    "however , in the analogous situation where @xmath60 is negative the propagation of a wave packet violates the global causal structure defined by the metric .",
    "for instance , the field @xmath61 , where @xmath48 is non injective , determines an @xmath41 pocket where a wave packet can follow the path represented in fig .",
    "[ tasca2 ] . in region",
    "@xmath50 propagation is inconsistent with the causal structure defined by the metric .",
    "a fermion wave packet entering the region @xmath54 from the left of the picture would immediately give rise to two other fermion - wave - packets appearing inside the pocket : one traveling up the region @xmath50 and annihilating with the initial wave packet ; the other traveling upward the region @xmath51 and emerging in the future .",
    "pocket and the a - causal propagation of a wave packet.,title=\"fig : \" ]    an objection to taking regions as the ones described as physically realistic comes from determinism . if the initial data are flat and the future is determined by the past , what could cause the development of a negative lapse region ?",
    "there are two possible answers .",
    "first , the flat case we have described is only a simple example .",
    "one might imagine that in a generic curved spacetime with matter the determinant of the metric can evolve towards zero , and the smooth continuation of the tetrad field evolution generate negative-@xmath43 regions .",
    "more interestingly , pockets can appear in of - shell quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field , namely in the context of quantum gravity . in the next section",
    ", we turn to such a context .    in conclusion ,",
    "if gravity is described by the tetrad , there might be spacetime regions where the determinant of @xmath34 is negative and a fermion clock runs backward with respect to a pendulum clock governed by the metric .",
    "do such regions exist in nature , or should we assume that all gravitational fields in nature satisfy @xmath62 and @xmath63 ?",
    "since the difference is measurable , the question is well posed .",
    "the question closing the previous section becomes particularly significative in quantum gravity , when the dynamics is defined  la feynman by summing over field configurations .",
    "should the sum be taken over all tetrad fields , or only over those with @xmath64 ?",
    "if the gravitational action is taken to be the einstein - hilbert action @xmath65 which depends on the metric , the issue is not much relevant , since tetrads with different signs of @xmath43 give the same action .",
    "but the natural geometric action for the tetrad is not @xmath65 , but rather s_= [ eef^ * ] , where @xmath66 is the curvature of the spin connection and the star indicates the hodge dual in minkowski space .",
    "this action _ differs _ from @xmath65 by a sign when @xmath67 .",
    "this can be easily seen writing the two in tensor notation as functions of @xmath34 : @xmath68 , \\label{tb}\\\\ s_{\\text{tetrad}}&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^4x\\ ; ( \\det e)\\   r[e ] , \\label{ta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the ricci scalar .",
    "@xmath69 defines a quantum theory where negative @xmath70 regions contribute to the amplitude with a negative sign . loosely speaking ,",
    "the metric is the square of the tetrad , and a sign is lost in the metric formulation .",
    "the effect of this sign appears in covariant loop quantum gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the contribution of a single simplex to the dynamics is given in the semiclassical limit by a vertex amplitude satisfying @xcite a  e^ s+e^-s , [ terms ] where @xmath71 is a discretization of @xmath65 ( with or without cosmological constant ) associated to the simplex .",
    "the two terms in are determined by the two possible signs that @xmath43 can take on the simplex @xcite .",
    "the same happens in the 3d ponzano - regge model @xcite .    if in nature it is always true that @xmath64 , then the second terms in should perhaps be seen as spurious .",
    "attempts to get rid of it have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "but if such regions can exist , then it is reasonable to assume that they affect the gravitational path integral , and the existence of the two terms in simply reflects their existence . in other words",
    ", spacetime might fluctuate over negative @xmath43 regions .",
    "the fact that these regions are physically distinguishable , as shown in this paper , renders this scenario more plausible .    as noticed in @xcite , there is an analogy between negative @xmath43 regions and antiparticles . in both cases",
    ", the action contributes to the feynman sum with a reversed sign . both can be seen , in a sense , as configurations running backward in time . for antiparticles ,",
    "this is the intuition that grounds the stckelberg - feynman positron theory @xcite , where antiparticles are interpreted as particles running backward in time .",
    "the analogy is reinforced by the results of the previous sections , where we have shown that a fermion crossing a negative @xmath43 region is affected as if time was running backward therein .",
    "these observations justify the evocative name  anti - spacetimes \" suggested in @xcite for such regions .",
    "feynman has given in @xcite a general physical argument indicating that antiparticles should exist as a general consequence of quantum theory and special relativity : positive - energy propagation necessarily spills outside the light cone ; but spacelike propagation can be interpreted as backward in time in a different lorentz frame .",
    "can an analogous argument be formulated in quantum gravity ?",
    "the existence of fermions indicates that the complete characterization of gravity requires a tetrad field @xmath72 .",
    "the natural geometric action for this field differs from the einstein - hilbert action by a sign factor , determined by the determinant @xmath43 .",
    "regions of negative @xmath43 , or  anti - spacetimes \" , might therefore contribute to the quantum gravity path integral .",
    "this is what happens in the ponzano - regge model and in loop gravity , where the two signs of @xmath43 are at the source of the two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the vertex amplitude .",
    "here we have shown that if such anti - spacetime regions exist , they are in principle detectable . over an",
    " anti - spacetime \" region , the fermion s phase runs backward with respect to a standard clock .",
    "tetrads corresponding to the same metric can be physically inequivalent .",
    "the are several possibilities : ( i ) anti - spacetimes do not exist , @xmath64 should constrain the gravity path integral , the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath69 is irrelevant .",
    "( ii ) anti - spacetimes exist , but they contribute trivially to quantum gravity because the relevant action is @xmath65 .",
    "( iii ) the relevant action is @xmath69 , anti - spacetimes exist and contribute nontrivially to quantum gravity .",
    "we are inclined to think that the detectability of anti - spacetime , via fermion interference , enhances the credibility of the last scenario .",
    "do anti - spacetimes exist in nature ?",
    "do they contribute to a feynman formulation of quantum gravity in the same manner as antiparticles contribute to the total propagation of particles ?",
    "these questions are well defined experimentally (  are there regions where the phase of a fermion runs backward with respect to the minkowski time ? \" ) and theoretically (  which of the two actions and defines quantum gravity \" ? ) .",
