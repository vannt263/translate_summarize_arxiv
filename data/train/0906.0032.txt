    "a 2-dimensional electron system ( 2des ) at high magnetic fields , @xmath3 , and low temperatures , @xmath4 , exhibits the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) , which is characterized by plateaus in the hall resistance @xmath2 _ vs_. @xmath3 , at @xmath5 , with @xmath6 = 1,2,3 , ... and concurrent vanishing diagonal resistance @xmath1 as @xmath7 0 k , in the vicinity of integral filling factors of landau levels , i.e. , @xmath8.@xcite with the increase of the electron mobility , @xmath9 , at a given electron density , @xmath10 , and low @xmath4 , iqhe plateaus typically become narrower as fractional quantum hall effects ( fqhe ) appear in the vicinity of @xmath11 , at @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 denotes mostly odd - denominator rational fractions.@xcite experimental studies of the highest mobility specimens have typically focused upon fqhe and other novel phases.@xcite meanwhile , the possibility of new variations of iqhe that might appear with the canonical effect in the reduced - disorder specimen , especially at large-@xmath0 , has been largely unanticipated . in the first dark - study part of this paper , we show that three distinct phase relationships can occur between the oscillatory diagonal- and hall- resistances in the high - mobility dark specimen at @xmath14 , and that iqhe can be manifested in two of these variations .",
    "the results therefore suggest one new class of iqhe , as they provide insight into the origin of oscillatory variations in the hall effect , and their evolution into hall plateaus , in the low-@xmath3 large-@xmath0 regime of the radiation - induced zero - resistance states in the photoexcited high mobility 2des.@xcite    = 3.25 in    transport studies of photo - excited two - dimensional electron systems have become a topic of interest following the discovery of novel radiation - induced zero - resistance states in the gaas / algaas system at high filling factors.@xcite the characteristic field @xmath15 for these zero - resistance states and associated magneto - resistance oscillations is a linear function of the radiation frequency , @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 , and , therefore , an increase in @xmath16 could be expected to bring about an overlap of the radiation - induced zero - resistance states and the quantum hall effect . in this case , a topic of interest is the interplay between the radiation - induced phenomena and quantum hall effect .",
    "hence , in the second part of the paper , we follow up the above - mentioned dark - study of oscillatory resistances and quantum hall effect at large filling factors , by examining also the influence of microwave photo - excitation . here , the experimental results show that vanishing resistance induced by photo - excitation helps to replace the quantum hall effect by an ordinary hall effect over broad magnetic field intervals in the vicinity of the radiation - induced oscillatory @xmath1 minima .",
    "the results also identify a strong correlation between the vanishing of sdh oscillations in @xmath1 and the narrowing of hall plateaus in @xmath2 under photo - excitation .",
    "comparative plots of the oscillatory diagonal and off - diagonal resistances that help to establish this correlation also serve to confirm the observations made on the dark specimen , namely , that iqhe sometimes goes together with `` type-3 '' resistance oscillations in the high mobility specimen at large @xmath0 .",
    "simultaneous low - frequency ac lock - in based electrical measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 were carried out on gaas / algaas single hetero - junctions at @xmath18 , with matched lock - in time constants , and sufficiently slow @xmath3-field sweep rates .",
    "the @xmath3-field was calibrated by esr of dpph.@xcite    = 3.0 in    shubnikov - de haas oscillations and associated iqhe became weaker , as usual , at higher @xmath4 , and few oscillations or hall plateaus were evident for @xmath19 at @xmath20 in the dark study .",
    "thus , we focused upon @xmath21 , where @xmath4-induced changes in the phase relations were not discerned and , further , beats were not observed in the sdh oscillations .",
    "the observed phase differences were verified not to be experimental artifacts originating from the choice of experimental parameters such as the b - sweep rate , the data acquisition rate , lock - in integration time , and other typical variables .",
    "the observed phase relations also did not show an obvious dependence on the sample geometry , or type ( au - ge / ni or in ) of contacts .",
    "the reported phase relation between the oscillatory hall- and diagonal- resistances could often be identified by eye . yet , we have utilized background subtraction here for the sake of presentation , mainly to realize overlays in the figures , for phase comparison .",
    "an explicit example of the background subtraction procedure is illustrated in appendix a. finally , although the mobility @xmath9 has been provided , @xmath9 alone seems not to be sufficient for classifying the observed phenomena in high-@xmath9 specimens . here , the high mobility condition was realized by brief illumination with a red led .",

    "to review the basics , figure 1(a ) exhibits measurements from a typical low mobility hall bar specimen with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here , as is usual with iqhe , large amplitude shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in @xmath1 lead into zero - resistance states with increasing @xmath3 , as @xmath2 exhibits plateaus at @xmath24 for @xmath25 , with @xmath6 = 2,4,6 , ... this canonical low - mobility iqhe system is known to follow a resistivity / resistance rule,@xcite at a each @xmath4,@xcite whereby @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 is the @xmath3-field derivative of @xmath2.@xcite in order to check the validity of this rule , fig .",

    "there also occurs the more remarkable `` type-3 '' case where @xmath38 is enhanced ( suppressed ) at the @xmath1 sdh oscillation minima ( maxima ) and the @xmath30 oscillations are phase - shifted by approximately `` @xmath39 '' with respect to the @xmath1 or @xmath29 oscillations , as shown in fig .",

    "4(a ) and 4(b ) provide further evidence for in - phase `` type-2 '' oscillations in a hall bar . here , the hall oscillations tend to enhance the magnitude of @xmath2 at the @xmath1 sdh maxima ( `` type-2 '' ) , even as hall plateaus are imperceptible in the @xmath2 curve . yet , from fig .",
    "4(a ) , it is clear that @xmath43 is a hall effect component , and not a misalignment offset admixture of @xmath1 into @xmath2 , since @xmath30 is antisymmetric under @xmath3-reversal .",

    "this plot suggests that as the amplitude of shubnikov - de haas oscillations in @xmath1 is reduced by photo - excitation , for example , in the vicinity of the @xmath100 radiation - induced resistance minimum , the hall plateaus tend to narrow and vanish , although the plateaus reappear once again at either end of the @xmath100 minimum , when the shubnikov - de haas oscillations in @xmath1 grow stronger .",

    "concurrently , the amplitude of shubnikov - de haas oscillations in @xmath1 becomes smaller in the vicinity of , for example , the @xmath100 minimum .",

    "it is worth pointing out that iqhe were easily observable down to approximately @xmath108 at this temperature , @xmath109 , in the absence of photo - excitation , as in fig .",
    "10 shows , however , that under photo - excitation , although some iqhe are still observable in the vicinity of @xmath110 , they disappear in the vicinity of @xmath111 as a consequence of the photo - excitation , only to reappear at an even higher @xmath3 .    the data of figs . 8 - 10",
    "help to illustrate that microwave photo - excitation not only produces radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations , but it also influences the amplitude of shubnikov - de haas oscillations , producing a non - monotonic variation in the amplitude of these oscillations _ vs_. @xmath3 or @xmath0 .",
    "further , the data show that this non - monotonic variation in the amplitude of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations correlates with a non - monotonic variation in the width of the iqhe plateaus _ vs_. @xmath3 or @xmath0 .",

    "<S> we report the experimental results from a dark study and a photo - excited study of the high mobility gaas / algaas system at large filling factors , @xmath0 . at large-@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the dark study indicates several distinct phase relations ( `` type-1 '' , `` type-2 '' , and `` type-3 '' ) between the oscillatory diagonal- and hall- resistances , as the canonical integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) is manifested in the `` type-1 '' case of approximately orthogonal diagonal- and hall resistance- oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the investigation indicates quantum hall plateaus also in the `` type-3 '' case characterized by approximately `` anti - phase '' hall- and diagonal- resistance oscillations , suggesting a new class of iqhe .    </S>",
    "<S> transport studies under microwave photo - excitation exhibit radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations in both the diagonal , @xmath1 , and off - diagonal , @xmath2 , resistances . </S>",
    "<S> further , when the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations extend into the quantum hall regime , there occurs a radiation - induced non - monotonic variation in the amplitude of shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in @xmath1 _ </S>",
    "<S> vs_. b , and a non - monotonic variation in the width of the quantum hall plateaus in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect leads into the vanishing of iqhe at the minima of the radiation - induced @xmath1 oscillations with increased photo - excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we reason that the mechanism which is responsible for producing the non - monotonic variation in the amplitude of sdh oscillations in @xmath1 under photo - excitation is also responsible for eliminating , under photo - excitation , the novel `` type-3 '' iqhe in the high mobility specimen . </S>"
