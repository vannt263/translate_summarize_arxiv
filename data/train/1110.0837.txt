    "the accretion of gas onto galaxies is regarded as a process fundamental to their formation @xcite and is required to reconcile the limited cool gas supply in galactic disks with the cosmic star formation history @xcite .",

    "recent semi - analytic and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations @xcite suggest that the requisite baryons are delivered from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) or low - mass satellites to high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) galaxies via cool ( temperature @xmath14 k ) filaments of dense gas . at @xmath15",
    ", these filaments are truncated in massive halos , but accretion in the form of dense , cold clouds persists .    in the milky way ,",

    "previously - expelled material may be recycled to provide additional fuel for star formation ( i.e. , in a galactic fountain ; @xcite ) , and likely gives rise to intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) at distances @xmath17 kpc @xcite .",
    "in addition , nearby spirals exhibit both extraplanar clouds and morphological disturbances which may be attributed to gas infall @xcite . however , the emission from these diffuse structures is difficult to map beyond @xmath18 mpc @xcite , and empirical evidence for gas accretion ( or re - accretion ) onto more distant galaxies is poignantly lacking .",
    "cool accreting gas which has been enriched to modest metallicities ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) may give rise to absorption in background light sources in rest - frame ultraviolet transitions such as @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "however , studies of cool gas absorption along the sightlines toward star - forming galaxies have instead reported the ubiquity of outflows at @xmath22 @xcite . in one of the only studies showing evidence for inflows in distant systems , @xcite report _ redshifted _",

    "the lack of evidence for the inflow phenomenon is hardly surprising given that the predicted covering factor of accreting gas is small ( e.g. , @xmath27 at @xmath28 ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , as we will demonstrate , studies of cool gas kinematics in galaxy spectra are likely to identify inflows only if they achieve signal - to - noise ( s / n ) levels adequate for analysis of individual spectra , rather than coadded data . in this letter , we report on high - s / n keck / lris spectra of a sample of six star - forming galaxies at @xmath29 found to exhibit inflows traced by and/or @xmath30 absorption .",

    "the remaining ( redder ) objects have low sfrs ( @xmath63 ) and lie in the green valley between the red sequence and the blue cloud . because these latter galaxies have disk - like rather than disturbed or early - type morphologies it is likely that these objects appear in the green valley due to enhanced dust reddening and their relatively modest sfrs , rather than the sudden cessation of star formation .",
    "further , the hst / acs imaging of these objects suggests the presence of several compact , star - forming knots in the outskirts of the galactic disks . taken together ,",
    "the stellar masses ( @xmath64 ) , sfrs , optical colors and morphologies of these three galaxies indicate that they are close analogs to the milky way , while the higher - sfr subset of the inflow sample has slightly lower stellar masses and more diffuse morphologies .",

    "all but one of the six inflow galaxies are highly inclined ( having @xmath65 ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates only a 1.1% probability that the inflow and parent populations are drawn from the same distribution .",

    "the median and @xmath67 inclinations are marked with dashed lines .",
    "the distribution of inclinations for galaxies exhibiting inflows ( red ) is skewed to high values ( i.e. , they are edge - on ) . [ fig.cmdi ] ]",
    "we have discovered a small sample of late - type , highly inclined , star - forming galaxies having sfrs over a wide range whose spectra show evidence for redshifted cool gas absorption .",
    "we interpret these kinematics as evidence for gaseous infall and discuss these findings in the context of galaxy formation models below , but first critique alternative explanations .",
    "if a galaxy s motions are dominated by rotation , the ism absorption may appear offset from the systemic velocity for an asymmetric gas distribution .",
    "because this inflow galaxy sample is nearly edge - on , we are particularly sensitive to velocity offsets in the direction of rotation . @xcite analyzed line emission in two - dimensional spectra of two of these objects , finding line - of - sight terminal rotation velocities of @xmath68 and @xmath69 for tkrs4045 and tkrs4387 , respectively . in an extreme scenario in which all -absorbing ism is located on only the receding side of these galaxies ( and therefore has @xmath70 ) , it may appear to be offset in velocity by @xmath71 from the stellar absorption .",
    "while most of our measured inflow velocities are much larger than @xmath72 , tkrs4387 has a @xmath73 of only @xmath74 .",
    "however , given the velocity resolution and s / n of our spectra , we would be unlikely to detect this absorption unless it covers well over half ( @xmath75 ) of the galaxy continuum ( i.e. , unless the profile is sufficiently deep )",
    ". a spurious inflow signature could additionally result from an error in our determination of the galaxy systemic velocities due to , e.g. , a spatial offset between our slitlets and the centroid of the stellar continuum emission , such that the galaxy spectra are dominated by light from the approaching part of the disks .",
    "however , most of the galaxies have diameters @xmath76 , and a @xmath38 slit width was used in @xmath77 seeing conditions ; in addition , this scenario would yield an artificial inflow velocity of only @xmath78 and @xmath72 in the cases of tkrs4045 and tkrs4387 .",
    "we therefore adopt the interpretation that the absorption arises from metal - enriched gas flowing toward each galaxy from the igm , as part of an accreting satellite , or from recycled wind material circulating in a galactic fountain .    at the most conservative level",
    ", the detection of six galaxies with inflows in a sample of 101 ( with sufficient s / n ) implies a covering fraction of such material of @xmath79 .",
    "this estimate should be considered a firm lower limit , however .",
    "these six galaxies are unique not for the presence of strong absorption redward of systemic velocity , but instead for the _ absence _ of strong , blueshifted absorption .",
    "figure  [ fig.ews ] shows line profiles for one object in our inflow sample ( bottom panel ) and three other objects drawn from the parent lris sample .",
    "a by - eye analysis ( and our fitting results ) suggests that profiles ( a ) and ( b ) exhibit outflows ; i.e. , they show an excess of absorption blueward of systemic velocity .",
    "profile ( c ) is symmetric and dominated by absorption at systemic velocity .",
    "however , all of these profiles have similar @xmath80 ews ( @xmath81  ) redward of systemic velocity ( yellow ) , and thus could easily be tracing significant amounts of gas moving toward the host galaxies at @xmath82 .",
    "the difference in the measured kinematics is due to the differences in ews at systemic velocity and blueward ( cyan ) ; i.e. , profiles ( a - c ) have blueward ews at least 0.5   larger than the profile from the inflow sample ( d ) .",
    "we are therefore sensitive to inflows only in the absence of strong outflows , and are likely missing instances of cool accretion in our larger parent sample .",
    "for instance , the fraction of the parent sample with @xmath83 or @xmath80 ews at least as large as those measured for our inflow sample in the velocity range @xmath84 ( 0.61 and 0.74  , respectively ) is 26 - 47% .",
    "furthermore , 23% of the parent sample has @xmath80 ews @xmath85   in the velocity range @xmath86 ( i.e. , at least as large as the ews for those inflow galaxies with @xmath87 ) .",
    "we therefore suspect the presence of inflow traced by saturated metal - line absorption in up to @xmath88 of our parent sample , and suggest that it is likely occurring in at least @xmath89 of the galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that due to the low frequency of detected inflows in individual spectra , the observed inflow signatures would likely be completely obscured in coadds of the parent sample ( or subsamples thereof ) , similar to the composite spectra analyzed in @xcite .",
    " ) at @xmath90 ( yellow ) , with a wide range in blueshifted ( cyan ) and systemic absorption strengths . dashed , dotted , and gray curves are as in figure 1 . despite the significant redshifted absorption , we only confidently identify inflow for the system without strong blueshifted / systemic absorption .",
    "[ fig.ews],width=192 ]    our observations provide almost no constraint on the distance between this inflowing gas and the galaxies or on the spatial distribution of the gaseous material . however , the large model @xmath53 values ( @xmath91 ) suggest that the material extends at minimum to sizes of order the size of the stellar disks ( listed in table 1 ) . in cases with high values of @xmath92 , we use the derived velocities and column densities to estimate a rough mass inflow rate .",
    "we assume that the absorbing gas has a surface area given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the average of the galaxy semi - major and semi - minor axes , and that the gas will accrete onto the galaxy with a timescale @xmath95 . neglecting ionization corrections , dust depletion , and assuming metallicities @xmath96",
    ", we find mass inflow rates @xmath97 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the values are slightly lower than the sfrs of the low - sfr half of the sample , and about an order of magnitude lower than the sfrs in the remaining galaxies .",
    "the inflow rates are also consistent with mass inflow rates derived for the milky way ( @xmath98 ; @xcite , lehner & howk 2011 , submitted ) .    given the strength of the metal - line absorption , the observed inflows are unlikely to arise from the  cold flows \" which are invoked to provide pristine hydrogen to star - forming galaxies from the igm @xcite .",
    "instead , this gas may have been enriched by star formation in satellite dwarf galaxies , or may have already cycled through the host galaxy s ism .",
    "ivcs and hvcs in our own galaxy could easily give rise to the inflow signatures observed in our sample , as they have a wide range of velocities ( up to @xmath99 ) and are mostly optically thick in with metallicities @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite suggest that the recycling of gas blown out by winds is the dominant mode of accretion in halos with masses above @xmath101 at @xmath102 , with recycling times @xmath103 gyr .",
    "further , detailed simulations of individual galaxy halos show that accretion occurs in the plane of the galactic disk , rather than along the minor axis ( @xcite , mnard & murray 2011 , in prep ) .",
    "winds vent out of the galaxy along the path with the lowest ambient gas pressure , i.e. , the minor axis , preventing accretion from occurring in locations other than along the disk plane .",
    "while we have not ruled out the presence of infall onto galaxies along their minor axes , results from these simulations are fully consistent with our detection of inflows along the line - of - sight toward several highly - inclined , disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "these results highlight the importance of analysis of cool gas kinematics in distant galaxies on an individual basis . only through examination of absorption line profiles for a large sample of objects",
    "were a handful of examples of cool gas accretion , a process fundamental to galaxy formation , identified . at the same time , these spectra provide only a cursory view of the complexities of gas infall and recycling .",
    "studies of gas kinematics at higher spectral resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in large galaxy samples are needed to achieve tighter constraints on the frequency of inflows and the concurrent action of outflows and inflows .",
    "equally propitious are studies of cool gas abundances along sightlines to background qsos that may differentiate between pristine gas accreted from the igm and material that has been previously recycled @xcite .",
    "the combination of these experiments in studies of individual halos will in turn enable the simultaneous mapping of gas abundances and kinematics relative to the host galaxies .",
    "in concert with hydrodynamic simulations that track the accretion , expulsion , and recycling of gas , these observations will provide unprecedented insight into the processes regulating galaxy growth .",
