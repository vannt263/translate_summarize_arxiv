    "the macroscopic behavior of many - body systems depends on whether the interaction is of long - range or short - range . for many - body systems with short - range interaction , the thermodynamic observables such as entropy and magnetization",
    "are additive and extensive but not so for those with long - range interaction .",
    "the additivity and the extensivity of observables are assumed to hold in the equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "macroscopic behaviors of many - body systems with long - range interaction are quite different from those with short - range one @xcite .",
    "the long - range interaction system is likely to be trapped in quasi - stationary states ( qsss ) , and accordingly a very long time is needed to reach the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the duration of those qsss increases according to the system size , and diverges if one takes the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "it is a widely accepted understanding that the equilibration is brought about by the finite size effect .",
    "a way to analyze a hamiltonian system with long - range interaction is to use the vlasov equation or collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite , which can be derived by taking the limit of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of elements @xcite .",
    "the qsss are supposed to be associated with stable stationary solutions to the vlasov equation @xcite . finding a stability criterion for stationary solutions to the vlasov equation is the first step to investigate qsss , since such a criterion makes it possible to decide whether a stationary solution can be a qss or not .",
    "the stability of solutions to the vlasov equation has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "there are several concepts of stability such as the spectral stability , the linear stability , the formal stability , and the nonlinear stability @xcite .",
    "the interest of this paper centers on the spectral stability and the formal stability , but the linear stability and the nonlinear stability are not touched upon .",
    "the formal @xcite and spectral @xcite stability criteria for spatially homogeneous solutions have been well known already .",
    "meanwhile , the stability of spatially inhomogeneous solutions has been investigated in the astrophysics @xcite since around a half century ago .",
    "the stability for the spherical galaxy is rigorously investigated recently @xcite .",
    "antonov s variational principle @xcite particularly gives a necessary and sufficient condition for stability of some stationary solution by considering stability against not all perturbations but only accessible perturbations called phase preserving perturbations @xcite .",
    "the restriction for the perturbations comes from the fact that the vlasov equation has an infinite number of invariants .",
    "we note that the stability of given stationary state can not be determined by using the stability criterion given in a statement of antonov s variational principle @xcite practically .    in the context of statistical physics for qsss , the stability of spatially inhomogeneous solutions to the vlasov equation",
    "has been studied , say , by campa and chavanis @xcite .",
    "they set up criteria for formal stability both in the most refined form and in less refined forms , by using the fact that accessible perturbations conserve all casimir invariants at linear order .",
    "we call the most refined formal stability , simply , the formal stability in this paper .",
    "their formal stability criterion in the most refined form requires one to take into account an infinite number of casimir invariants and to detect an infinite number of associated lagrangian multipliers in order to determine the stability of spatially inhomogeneous stationary solutions .",
    "their formal stability criterion is hence hard to use .",
    "in contrast with this , the canonical formal stability criterion which is one of the less refined formal stability criteria is of practical use .",
    "using the canonical formal stability criterion , one can check stability of a stationary state against a perturbation which keeps the normalization condition but may break the energy conservation and other casimir invariant conditions .",
    "though the criterion for canonical formal stability is stated as a necessary and sufficient condition , it is just a sufficient condition for the formal stability .",
    "it is to be expected that a criterion for the formal stability is found out in the form of necessary and sufficient condition without reference to an infinite number of quantities such as lagrangian multipliers .",
    "this article deals with the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model @xcite with the anticipation stated above .",
    "the hmf model is a simple toy model which shows typical long - range features .",
    "for instance , the hmf model has been used for investigating the nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite , the core - halo structure @xcite , the creation of small traveling clusters @xcite , the construction of traveling clusters @xcite , and a relaxation process with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the hmf model allows one to perform theoretical study on dynamics near spatially inhomogeneous stationary solutions to the vlasov equation by the use of the dispersion function which can be explicitly written out for the hmf model .",
    "for instance , the dynamics of a perturbation around the spatially inhomogeneous stationary solution @xcite and the algebraic damping to a qss @xcite have been investigated theoretically and numerically by using the hmf model .",
    "further , the linear response to the external field is studied in an explicit form @xcite for a spatially inhomogeneous qss . in those studies ,",
    "the stability of the spatially inhomogeneous solutions have been assumed to hold , and then it is worthwhile to give an explicit form of necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the spatially inhomogeneous stationary solutions .",
    "the aim of this article is to find spectral and formal stability criteria for spatially inhomogeneous stationary solutions .",
    "the spectral stability criterion is derived by means of the dispersion relation .",
    "the formal stability criterion is obtained by using the same idea as exhibited in @xcite .",
    "the criterion we are to find by using the angle - action variables is free from an infinite number of lagrangian multipliers , and is stated in the form of a necessary and sufficient condition , which allows us to look into the stability of spatially inhomogeneous solutions in an accessible manner .",
