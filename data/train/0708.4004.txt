    "many different types of magnetic systems are commonly modeled by spin hamiltonians , such as the heisenberg model . in special limits ,",
    "such model hamiltonians can be solved analytically , e.g. , by the bethe ansatz for integrable one - dimensional systems .",
    "away from special limits , powerful numerical methods , such as monte carlo simulations or density - matrix renormalization group techniques , provide much useful information , but at high computational cost .",
    "full exact diagonalization is even more expensive , and thus limited to rather small systems .",
    "quite generally , analytical and numerical techniques work best for models in which all sites are equivalent , so that translational invariance can be used to reduce the complexity of the problem .    in magnetic nanostructures@xcite and molecular magnets@xcite",
    ", the generic many - body features of spin hamiltonians coexist with additional real - life complications , such as impurities , defects , boundaries , textures , etc . the resulting _ spatially inhomogeneous _",
    "spin hamiltonians do not have translational symmetry , and often also lack other simplifying symmetries , which makes them hard to treat by traditional analytical and numerical methods .    mean - field theory can , of course , always be applied , but is not sufficiently reliable to permit quantitative modeling , and is often even qualitatively wrong . in this paper",
    "we describe one analytical and one numerical method to obtain beyond - mean - field energies for spin chains without translational invariance .",
    "the analytical calculations are based on model density - functional theory ( dft ) . in _",
    "ab initio _ electronic - structure calculations dft@xcite is a useful way to include correlations beyond the mean - field approximations , at very little additional computational cost . to deal with defects within dft for spin chains ,",
    "we propose a local - bond approximation ( lba ) , akin to the local - density approximation ( lda ) of _ ab initio _ dft and the local - spin approximation ( lsa ) previously proposed for spin systems with impurities@xcite .",
    "these schemes are described in sec .",
    "2 .    to obtain results with higher precision than is possible by local approximations , and to judge the performance of such simple improvements on mean - field theory , we also perform fully numerical calculations , employing an iterative modification of the power algorithm , described in section 3 .",
    "representative results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "dft has been applied to model hamiltonians , such as the heisenberg@xcite and the hubbard@xcite model , within generalized local - density approximations . specifically for the heisenberg model with impurity spins ,",
    "this scheme consists in adding to the mean - field energy a local approximation to the correlation energy @xmath0 , of the form @xmath1 = \\sum_i e_c^{hom}(j , s ) \\mid_{s\\rightarrow s_i}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all sites @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the per - site correlation energy of the homogeneous spin @xmath4 heisenberg model , for which various approximations exist@xcite .",
    "this so - called local - spin approximation@xcite has been applied to investigate the energetics of impurities in one , two and three - dimensional heisenberg models@xcite .",
    "impurities here are defined , relative to a homogeneous model in which all sites have the same spin @xmath4 , as sites with a spin @xmath5 ( see inset of fig . 1 for an example ) .",
    "another important class of spatial inhomogeneity , defects , can not be treated within the lsa .",
    "we define defects , again with respect to a homogeneous model , as bonds having strength @xmath6 ( see insets of figs . 1 and 2 for examples ) . to extend the local - approximation scheme to spin hamiltonians with defects ,",
    "we here propose the _ local - bond approximation ( lba ) _",
    ", @xmath7 = \\sum_b e_c^{hom}(j , s)|_{j\\rightarrow j_b } \\;,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all bonds @xmath8 , and for @xmath3 we use the same expressions employed in the lsa .",
    "conceptually , the lba decomposes the system in bonds , acting between sites , whereas the lsa decomposes it in sites , connected by bonds .",
    "both approximation schemes become exact for infinite homogeneous systems , and both can be used in analytical calculations , as all one has to do to obtain corrections to the mean - field energies is to evaluate eqs .",
    "( 1 ) or ( 2 ) site by site or bond by bond .",
    "to obtain energies of higher quality than is possible with analytical calculations employing local approximations , we resort to a numerical scheme . even in the presence of impurity spins and/or bond defects ,",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the exchange integral between nearest - neighbor spin - vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , conserves the @xmath13-component of the total spin , @xmath14 .",
    "the lieb - mattis theorem guaranties that the gs pertains to the subspace of minimum @xmath15 . as basis vectors",
    "we therefore use the set of quantum numbers @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the eigenvalues of @xmath11 , and can take values @xmath18 .",
    "a practical way of generating this set of states is by decomposing integer numbers .",
    "for instance , for a chain with four spins 1/2 , the binary decomposition of the integer 6 gives the sequence 0110 , representing the vector @xmath19 , one among other five of the subspace with @xmath20 .",
    "it is straightforward to assemble the matrix representation of @xmath21 in this base .",
    "however , although the resulting matrix is sparse , storing it is impractical : for 20 spins 1/2 the order of the matrix is 184756 , with 1108536 non - vanishing elements . in practice , we therefore do not store the matrix , but compute each matrix element every time it is needed ; this saves a lot of memory , but is time consuming .    to obtain the ground - state energy of @xmath21 we propose an iterative modification of the well - known power algorithm",
    "this modification , to be described in more detail in a separate publication , is easy to code and requires less memory than the lanczos method , although it typically takes more processing time to extract the ground state .",
    "the power algorithm starts by decomposing a trial function for the ground - state eigenvector in terms of the unknown eigenvectors @xmath22 of @xmath21 , according to @xmath23 , with @xmath24 constants . if @xmath25 is an upper limit of the energy spectrum , acting @xmath26 times with the operator @xmath27 on @xmath28 yields @xmath29 where @xmath30 . for antiferromagnetic chains ,",
    "the highest energy @xmath25 corresponds to the ferromagnetic configuration , whose value is trivial even in the presence of impurities or defects . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the above series is dominated by the ground - state term @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we can extract @xmath33 by performing @xmath34 where @xmath35 is any vector non - orthogonal to the ground state . without the constant @xmath25 , the method yields the highest ( in modulus ) eigenvalue instead .",
    "our experience shows that the best trial function is the nel state , a mean - field approximation for the ground state , consisting of a sequence of an up and down spins .    to speed up the search for @xmath33",
    ", we implement the above limit iteratively : at each step @xmath26 , we use for @xmath35 the state @xmath36 obtained in the previous step .",
    "this reduces the processing time to reach convergence , which we characterize by two successive values of @xmath37 differing by less than @xmath38 .",
    "typically , a few hundred @xmath26-steps are required for chains larger than 20 spins , and only a few dozens for smaller chains . using a desktop microcomputer with 1.5 mb of ram",
    ", we obtained the ground - state energy of a homogeneous chain with 30 spins 1/2 , reproducing the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "bond defects do not require more memory space .",
    "as a first application of the lba concept we compare , in fig .",
    "1 , an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin 1/2 ring ( periodic boundary conditions ) with one impurity spin @xmath39 to an afm spin 1/2 ring with one bond defect @xmath40 . in the mean - field approximation , both systems are , erroneously , predicted to have the same ground - state energy .",
    "this spurious degeneracy is lifted by adding the lsa and lba correlation energies , respectively .",
    "judged by the remaining distance to the exact data , lsa performs slightly better for the impurity than lba does for the defect , but both provide significant improvements on the mean - field data .",
    "( circles ) , treated exactly ( filled symbols ) and via local approximations lsa / lba ( open symbols ) . within mean - field theory ( stars ) , the impurity and the defect yield the same ground - state energy .",
    "inclusion of correlation energy in the lsa ( impurity case , open triangles ) and the lba ( defect case , open circles ) removes this spurious degeneracy . ]",
    "ferromagnetic ( fm ) defects , with @xmath41 , can be handled similarly .",
    "however , an ambiguity arises in how the local substitution is to be performed . in principle",
    ", the lba can be applied to a fm defect by substituting @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the first possibility can lead to positive correlation energies , in violation of the variational principle .",
    "the second and third possibilities correctly predict negative correlation energies , but numerically the second is slightly inferior to the third for the type of system investigated here , as judged by comparison to exact data .",
    "below , we thus employ the third substitution .",
    "physically , this choice , @xmath44 , means that a ferromagnetic bond does not contribute to the correlation energy , which is rather reasonable , as at zero temperature the mean - field energy of a homogeneous ferromagnetic chain is already exact .    in fig .",
    "2 we show ground - state energies of an afm spin chain ( open boundary conditions ) with one afm defect @xmath45 , and of the same chain with one relaxed fm defect , @xmath46 .",
    "comparison of lba data with exact data shows that the lba significantly improves on the mean - field approximation both for fm and afm defects .",
    "quantitatively , the performance for the fm defect ( squares in fig .",
    "2 ) is better than that for the afm defect , but in both cases a significant improvement over the mean - field data is achieved .",
    "note , in particular , that for an fm defect the mean - field curve is even qualitatively wrong , predicting a wrong sign for the slope at @xmath47 , whereas the lba recovers the correct behavior .",
    "we stress that the lba calculations for both afm and fm defects , as well as lsa calculations for impurities , can be done analytically , in any dimensionality and for any system size , regardless of boundary conditions and symmetries .",
    "such local approximations thus provide a very convenient way to obtain beyond - mean - field results at the expense of a conventional mean - field calculation .",
    "when used in this way , local approximations yield robust results of moderate precision , even for large and complex systems .",
    "high precision results , on the other hand , can not be expected from simple local approximations .",
    "improved algorithms for fully numerical diagonalization , such as that described in section 3 , can be used to make progress from exactly the opposite starting point : high precision for small systems .      00",
