    "while mesons in large @xmath0 continue to exhibit the quantum numbers of a single quark - antiquark pair , the large-@xmath0 baryon requires @xmath0 valence quarks , since su(@xmath0 ) group theory requires a minimum of @xmath0 fundamental representation indices to form a color singlet .. ] however , physical baryons consist also of myriad gluons and sea quark - antiquark pairs ; does this then imply that large @xmath0 baryons have a meaning only within the context of the valence quark model ?",
    "in this paper we claim that this is not the case , and indeed argue that it is possible to use the very existence of baryons boasting well - defined quantum numbers and large-@xmath0 arguments to derive a _ rigorous _ constituent quark picture .",
    "these assumptions are clearly independent of the momentum transfer scale , and therefore this constituent picture holds from the low - energy to deep - inelastic scattering regimes .",

    "it is not known where this transition occurs . ]",
    "this is actually the same picture , in a somewhat different language , used to derive an effective hamiltonian @xmath5 operator expansion for baryon observables .",
    "the operator expansion has been used to analyze phenomenologically the baryon mass spectrum of the ground - state@xcite , orbitally - excited@xcite , and heavy - quark@xcite baryons , as well as magnetic moments@xcite , axial - vector couplings@xcite , and photoproduction@xcite and pionic@xcite transitions of @xmath6s in large @xmath0 .",
    "we then apply this knowledge to a study of the charge radii of the nonstrange baryons @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we first present the generic expansion demanded by @xmath5 when no other physical input is included , and then specialize to include physical restrictions , such as the statement that the operators representing the charge radii must be proportional to the constituent quark charges .",
    "we find that there are actually two independent contributions at the leading order , @xmath7 , and one at @xmath8 .",
    "since there are six baryons in the @xmath9 multiplets , this implies a number of relations between the charge radii that are expected to be satisfied particularly well , as we explore below .",

    "[ concl ] .",
    "we begin with the quantum numbers of the current quarks themselves . to obtain the electric charge and hypercharge of the quarks for arbitrary @xmath0 , we require only that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 remain weak isospin doublets with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , that under strong isospin the up quark and down quark still form a doublet with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , while the strange and all other quarks are isosinglets , and that all quarks in the electroweak interaction and @xmath17 quarks in the strong interaction satisfy the gell - mann  nishijima condition @xmath18 then the cancellation of the su(@xmath0)@xmath19su(2)@xmath19u(1 ) standard model chiral anomalies imposes @xmath20 while under strong hypercharge one finds @xmath21 it is interesting to note that these results maintain for arbitrary @xmath0 the usual electric charge and hypercharge assignments familiar in @xmath22 , such as the proton quantum numbers @xmath23 .",
    "baryons in large @xmath0 have masses of @xmath24 , owing to both the intrinsic @xmath25 masses of the quarks and interaction terms which also scale as @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the emergence of an exact spin - flavor symmetry in the large-@xmath0 limit for any number of flavors was first demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that it is meaningful to classify baryons into spin - flavor representations at leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "the ground - state multiplet of baryons for arbitrary @xmath0 fills , by assumption , a spin - flavor multiplet described by a tensor completely symmetric on @xmath0 indices ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for three flavors ( @xmath17 ) , this is an su(6 ) multiplet that for @xmath10 reduces to the familiar positive - parity @xmath26-plet containing the spin-1/2 su(3 ) octet and spin-3/2 decuplet . when @xmath27 , these multiplets are much larger",
    ". then each multiplet possesses , in general , a number of states whose quantum numbers reduce to those of the familiar baryons in @xmath10 . for example , the spin - flavor multiplet of fig .",
    "1 decomposes into @xmath0 distinct flavor multiplets with spins 1/2 , 3/2 ,  , @xmath28 : is the @xmath2 to be identified as a spin-3/2 or spin-@xmath28 state ? in this case , one finds that@xcite @xmath29 , compared to @xmath30 .",
    "the observed relatively small @xmath2-@xmath1 mass splitting suggests that one should take @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 .",
    "similar considerations@xcite lead one to take the large-@xmath0 analogues of the familiar baryons to have the usual spins , isospins , and hypercharges of @xmath25 rather than @xmath24 . in particular , this identifies the proton as a state with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and valence quark content consisting of the usual triple of @xmath35 in an @xmath36 combination , augmented by @xmath37 @xmath38 pairs , each in a spin - singlet , isosinglet combination .",
    "then @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and one may verify the previous claim that @xmath23 .",
    "obtaining a rigorous constituent picture for baryons requires that each baryon truly resides in a unique spin - flavor multiplet . in the case of the familiar su(3 ) octet and decuplet baryons , this is the completely symmetric * 56 * -plet of su(6 ) .",
    "such an assumption is subject to two conditions :    1 .",
    "the baryons are stable under strong interactions , so that they are true narrow - width eigenstates of the strong hamiltonian .",
    "this is true in large @xmath0 , since the production of each meson costs one power of @xmath41 in the amplitude .",
    "it is also true for physical nucleons , where only weak decays are permitted , and to a lesser extent for the other ground - state baryons , where phase space suppresses such decays .",
    "configuration mixing between the dominant ground - state multiplet and higher multiplets is suppressed .. ] this is also true in large @xmath0 , where such mixing requires the exchange of gluons to excite the ground state into an overlap with the higher state .",
    "these gluon couplings introduce additional @xmath5 suppressions .",
    "for example , consider flipping the spin of one of the @xmath0 quarks in a proton to form a @xmath42 .",
    "dynamics tells us that the spatial wavefunction of the baryon should adjust itself to the new spin configuration ; however , since only one of the quarks in @xmath0 has changed , one expects this effect to be suppressed by some power of @xmath5 .",
    "once these conditions are satisfied , it becomes a matter of mathematics alone to identify individual `` constituent '' quarks within the baryon .",
    "this is seen from the spin - flavor young tableau for the ground state ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; the spin - flavor wavefunction is a completely symmetric tensor with @xmath0 indices , represented by @xmath0 boxes in the tableau .",
    "each index corresponds to a fundamental representation of the spin - flavor group , and carries precisely the same quantum numbers as one of the current quarks within the baryon .",
    "one may use spin - flavor projection operators to isolate these representation `` quarks '' ( which we call _ r - quarks _ ) , the collective action of which is to reproduce the _ entire _ baryon spin - flavor wavefunction . in terms of field theory ,",
    "the r - quarks are interpolating fields carrying the spin - flavor quantum numbers of current quarks , such that an appropriately symmetrized set of @xmath0 boast complete overlap with the baryon wavefunction ( fig .  [ merc ] ) .",
    "the r - quarks are then true `` constituent '' quarks , in that the baryon is constituted entirely of them and nothing else . to reiterate , _ the rigorous constituent quark is the r - quark , which is defined as the interpolating field associated with a single box in the baryon young tableau .",
    "_ it turns out that the `` naive quark model for an arbitrary number of colors '' presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the constituent quark model , is not so naive after all .",
    "we hasten to add that this is not a revolutionary idea .",
    "it was understood , at least implicitly , in a number of large-@xmath0 analyses where knowledge of the completeness of sets of spin - flavor operators acting upon particular baryon multiplets is important , such as in refs .",
    "@xcite . indeed , the `` quark representation '' presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is mathematically equivalent to the r - quark construction .",
    "our purpose in introducing the r - quark is to give such analyses a firm physical interpretation as well as to probe the limitations of this picture , as detailed above .",
    "obviously , such a manipulation can not possibly tell us everything about the baryon structure . as an explicit example , consider the strangeness content of the proton .",
    "we have argued that the flavor structure of the proton for arbitrary @xmath0 consists of the usual valence @xmath35 triple and @xmath37 @xmath38 pairs each in a spin - singlet , isosinglet combination .",
    "but if these are all of the r - quarks , how can the proton have strange content ?",
    "the answer is that @xmath43 pairs are present , as are other sea quarks and gluons , but all of these have been incorporated into the r - quarks . in terms of field theory , these other components have been integrated out in favor of the r - quark fields .",
    "pairs in the proton appear only in vacuum loops , which introduce @xmath5 suppressions compared to pure glue interactions .",
    "the same is not necessarily true for @xmath44 or @xmath45 pairs in the proton , which can appear in @xmath46-graphs . ] thus , the proton may have strange content even if it has no strange r - quarks .",
    "the r - quark decomposition clearly does not indicate in detail how constituent quarks are formed from the fundamental degrees of freedom in the baryon .",
    "but it does give , by construction , values for observable matrix elements that an arbitrarily good constituent quark model , i.e. , one that gives all of the correct baryon observables , must satisfy . in this way it serves as a means to improve explicit quark model calculations . as an example given in the next section",
    ", one can extract the r - quark masses and interaction energy terms from the @xmath11 spectrum .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that this decomposition has nothing to do with large @xmath0 _ per se _ , except that identifying physical baryons with distinct irreducible spin - flavor representations for larger @xmath0 is on somewhat more solid theoretical ground because of the conditions listed above .",
    "if one declares that the proton lies entirely in an su(6 ) * 56 * -plet in the physical case of @xmath10 , there is no problem in defining the three r - quarks .",
    "the analysis of any observable with given spin - flavor quantum numbers in the @xmath5 expansion may be carried out in essentially the same way : one simply writes down all operators with the same spin - flavor transformation properties as the observable , weighted with the appropriate suppression power of @xmath5 .",
    "the number of such operators is finite since the number of spin - flavor structures connecting the initial- and final - state baryons is finite . as a trivial example , consider the problem of mass operators of the @xmath47 nucleon states .",
    "the wigner - eckart theorem tells us that only operators with isospins @xmath48 or 1 can connect the states .",
    "indeed , the most general decomposition , as was done for the ground - state baryon masses@xcite , or the orbitally - excited baryons@xcite , or here for the charge radii , may be considered the application of the wigner - eckart theorem in spin - flavor space .",
    "we also see from this example that there are precisely as many operators ( 2 ) as independent mass observables , which permits arbitrary masses for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 states . in the given example , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 operators contribute to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . unless some of the operators in a given expansion may be eliminated or suppressed , the operators merely provide a reparametrization of the data , i.e. , a different basis for the same vector space of observables .",
    "however , we have not yet taken into account suppressions of operators by powers of @xmath5 . in order to identify these suppressions for baryons ,",
    "it is most convenient to work with r - quarks .",
    "let us define an _",
    "n - body operator _ as one that requires the participation of @xmath50 r - quarks ; that is , the feynman diagram has a piece that is @xmath50-particle irreducible .",
    "since r - quarks each carry a fundamental color index , they exchange gluons just like current quarks and hence obey the same large-@xmath0 counting rules .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to see that an @xmath50-body operator requires the exchange of a minimum of @xmath55 gluons and hence a suppression of @xmath56 , since@xcite @xmath57 .",
    "the most general possible @xmath50-body operators can be built from @xmath50th - degree polynomials in 1-body operators , whose members fill the adjoint representation of the spin - flavor group .",
    "we denote these @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the usual pauli spin matrices , @xmath60 denote gell - mann flavor matrices , and the index @xmath61 sums over all @xmath0 quark lines in the baryons . in the two - flavor case considered here , @xmath62 is replaced with the isospin operator @xmath63 .",
    "one then builds polynomials in @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 with the same spin - flavor quantum numbers as the observable in question",
    ".    however , there are still three important points to take into account before the analysis is complete . first , the operators in eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) sum over all the r - quarks in the baryon and may add coherently to give combinatoric powers of @xmath0 that compensate some of the @xmath5 suppressions .",
    "generally , this occurs for @xmath66 and not @xmath65 or @xmath64 , since we have chosen baryons to have spins and isospins of @xmath25 rather than @xmath24 .",
    "second , there exist relations , called operator reduction rules@xcite , between some combinations of operators due to the spin - flavor symmetry or the symmetry of the baryon representation .",
    "for example , one particular combination of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the quadratic casimir of the spin - flavor algebra , and just gives the same number when applied to all baryons in the same representation . in the two - flavor case with scalar operators , the operator reduction rules of ref .",
    "@xcite tell us that the @xmath70 never need appear , since every possible contraction of its spin index leads to a reducible combination .",
    "likewise , @xmath71 in the two - flavor case .",
    "third , the most complicated operator necessary to describe a baryon with @xmath0 r - quarks is an @xmath0-body operator .",
    "however , ultimately we are interested in the subset of these baryons that persist when @xmath10 , and by the same logic , these are completely described by expanding only out to 3-body operators .",
    "the 4- , 5- ,  , @xmath0-body operators would be linearly independent when acting upon the _ full _ baryon representation , but must be linearly dependent on the 0- , 1- , 2- , and 3-body operators when acting upon the baryons that persist for @xmath10 .",
    "since we are not taking the strict @xmath72 limit but rather @xmath0 large and finite , the question of losing information due to noncommutativity with the chiral limit@xcite does not arise .    using these rules , it is straightforward to write down the expansion for an arbitrary scalar quantity with possible isospin breaking but preserving @xmath73 ( as in electromagnetic interactions or masses ) .",
    "our example is the derivative of the baryon charge ( sachs ) form factor @xmath74 at @xmath75 , but note that the same expansion would hold for the whole @xmath76-dependent form factor , as well as masses@xcite : @xmath77 the brackets indicate that the operators are to be evaluated for a particular baryon state ; anticommutators are used to remind one that the commutator combinations are reducible , owing to the spin - flavor symmetry . here ,",
    "each of the coefficients @xmath78 possesses a @xmath5 expansion starting at order @xmath79 ; they play the role of reduced matrix elements in the wigner - eckart theorem .",
    "we make the naturalness assumption that any dimensionless coefficient appearing in the analysis is of order unity , unless one can think of a reason it is suppressed ( additional symmetry or chance dynamical cancellation ) or enhanced ( additional dynamics ) .",
    "an example of the first case is the neutron - proton mass difference , where one would find an anomalously small coefficient unless the approximate symmetry of isospin is recognized .",
    "an example of the second case is that the neutron - proton scattering lengths are much larger than `` natural size , '' pointing to shallow bound ( the deuteron ) or nearly bound ( @xmath80 ) states .    to illustrate the r - quark picture for the baryons ,",
    "consider the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses using the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath81 clearly gives a common mass @xmath82 to each r - quark , while the @xmath73 term differentiates @xmath83 and @xmath84 r - quarks .",
    "the remaining operators require interactions of the r - quarks and may be considered matrix elements of the potential . using breit - wigner masses for the @xmath2 states ( note ,",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a treatment using pole masses ) , one finds @xmath85 and the interaction energy terms for nucleons and @xmath2 s amount to about 73 and 366 mev , respectively .",
    "these values for the quark masses are consistent with those used in ordinary constituent quark models .",
    "the r - quark masses thus account for the bulk of baryon masses , underscoring the economy of this picture .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) in terms of the global quantum numbers @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which equal @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , in the two - flavor case",
    ". then the expansion reads @xmath90 where again each @xmath91 possesses a @xmath5 expansion starting at order @xmath79 .",
    "note in either case that there are 6 independent operators , reflecting that there are 6 observables , corresponding to the isodoublet of @xmath1 s and the isoquartet of @xmath2 s .",
    "equation ( [ opoldn ] ) is therefore the most general expansion one can write down , modified only by the @xmath5 suppression factors .",
    "for the particular case of the charge form factor , one can go a bit further . despite their @xmath24 masses ,",
    "baryons in large @xmath0 nevertheless have a finite size@xcite , so @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ opoldn ] ) should actually be replaced by @xmath93 .",
    "one can see this by noting that no interaction diagram in the baryon is larger than @xmath94 , so that the interaction energy per quark is no larger than @xmath79 , and thus the wavefunction of each quark has a spatial extent of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the most general expansion based solely upon symmetry and the grossest features of large @xmath0 reads @xmath95 this operator method lies at one extreme end of possible analyses , in that it includes _ only _ symmetry information . at",
    "the other end lie phenomenological models , in which not only the structure of the individual operators but also their coefficients are provided . as an intermediate choice , one may impose mild physical constraints on the allowed operators ; this is the approach of the `` general parametrization ( gp ) method''@xcite .",
    "it was applied to the case of baryon charge radii@xcite in order to check relations appearing in a quark model calculation@xcite that includes two - body exchange currents .",
    "here we extend the analysis to arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "pion - baryon couplings are studied using the gp and compared with results of a @xmath5 approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that these `` mild physical constraints '' do indeed impose some model dependence on the gp , meaning that its predictivity follows not from qcd alone but requires additional dynamical assumptions .",
    "however , as argued next and in the first paragraph of sec .",
    "[ results ] , these assumptions have a firm dynamical basis and are more mild than those of an arbitrary model .",
    "the assumptions of the gp method for charge form factors are quite minimal : all scalar operators are allowed that couple to the quarks ( r - quarks in our case ) through precisely one factor of the quark charges , which is what one expects from a single photon vertex .",
    "then one has @xmath96 the rules for assigning @xmath5 suppressions in the coefficients are the same as above : @xmath50-body operators have a factor @xmath56 , and @xmath97 each possess @xmath5 expansions starting at order @xmath79 .",
    "note that this expression , unlike eq .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , has no strange quark term : as discussed above , the @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s have no strange r - quarks ; the @xmath43 contributions appear as @xmath8 corrections to the dynamical coefficients already presented .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate matrix elements of these three operators .",
    "the sums are re - expressed in terms of the casimirs @xmath87 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . to evaluate the final two casimirs , note that the spin - flavor wavefunction is completely symmetric .",
    "thus , all of the @xmath83 quarks , for example , are in a symmetric state , and one then has total @xmath83-quark spin @xmath101 . after simplifying all terms , one finds @xmath102 \\left [ n_c - 2j \\right ] / 2n_c , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ opold ] ) and ( [ opnew ] ) .",
    "first , one sees that the latter is , as it must be , a special case of the most general possible expression eq .",

    "the other terms in eq .",

    "explicit isospin breaking due to , say , the @xmath83-@xmath84 quark mass difference introduces factors of the operator @xmath119 , which do not conform to the expression ( [ opnew ] ) , but appear with an additional small ( @xmath120 ) coefficient .",
    "similar statements are expected for loop corrections ; for example , one can see how electromagnetic loop corrections induce a @xmath118 and possibly other suppressed terms in the expansion , at the cost of an @xmath121 suppression .",
    "inasmuch as these additional effects are dynamically suppressed , the gp expansion should give an excellent expansion for the charge form factors .",
    "since the neglected coefficients are small , they would make little numerical difference if included in the analysis below .    one interesting feature of the gp expression eq .",
    "( [ opnew ] ) is that the terms not proportional to the total baryon charge @xmath87 are all proportional to @xmath122 , and in particular , vanish for @xmath32 .",
    "that is , all charge radii ( and other electromagnetic matrix elements ) are proportional to @xmath87 for @xmath32 , which was pointed out by coleman@xcite for the case @xmath10 .",
    "the symmetry reason for this feature is not hard to see : the charge operator @xmath87 transforms according to the adjoint representation of the spin - flavor group . the @xmath32 flavor representation , unlike that of @xmath34 , 3/2 , ",
