    "characteristics of the super - dense objects like neutron stars ( nss ) are based on the calculations of the eos for the matter at very high densities .",
    "however , the nuclear interactions beyond the density of @xmath3 are empirically not well known ( dolan 1992 ) and the all known eoss are only extrapolations of the empirical results far beyond this density range . in this",
    "regard , various eoss based on theoretical manipulations are available in the literature ( arnett & bowers 1977 ) . since the status of eos of nuclear matter can not be established empirically beyond a certain density range , one can apply physical constraints to obtain an upper bound of neutron star mass .",
    "brecher and caporaso ( 1976 ) assumed that the speed of sound in the nuclear matter equals the speed of light and obtained a value of @xmath4 as an upper limit of the neutron star masses .",
    "however , the matter described by this stiffest eos , @xmath5 ( geometrized units ) or @xmath6 [ where @xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath8 is the energy - density and @xmath9 represents the surface density ] has a super - dense self - bound state at the surface of the configuration where the pressure is vanishingly small , which represent the ` abnormal state of matter ' ( lee 1975 ; haensel & zdunik 1989 ) .",
    "this ` abnormality ' may be specified as - ( i ) the pressure vanishes at the average nuclear densities , and ( ii ) the speed of sound is equal to that of light even when the pressure is vanishing small .",
    "this ` abnormality ' can be removed if we ensure continuity of pressure , density and both of the metric parameters at the boundary of the structure ( negi & durgapal 2000 ) .",
    "earlier , rhoades and ruffini ( 1974 ) , without going into the details of the nuclear interactions , assumed that beyond a certain density @xmath10 ( the range of densities where no extrapolated eos is known ) the eos in the core is given by the criterion that the speed of sound attains the speed of light , that is , @xmath11 , and matched the core to an envelope with the bps ( baym , pethick & sutherland 1971 ) eos and obtained an upper limit for the neutron star mass as @xmath12 .",
    "hartle ( 1978 ) emphasized that the maximum masses of neutron stars obtained in this manner involve a scale factor , @xmath13^{-1/2}$ ] , such that , the matching density , @xmath14 , plays a sensitive role to obtain an upper bound on neutron star masses .",
    "usually , @xmath15 is taken to be equal to or greater than one in all the conventional models .",
    "for the densities less than @xmath14 , the matter composing the object is assumed to be known and unique .",
    "that is , the eos of the envelope of these stars are chosen so that the ` abnormalities ' in the sense mentioned above are removed .",
    "friedman and ipser ( 1987 ) calculated the masses of the neutron stars for different values of the matching densities using eos given by bps and nv ( negele & vautherin 1973 ) , respectively , and concluded that the eos chosen for the envelope does not make any significant difference in the results , because in each case the mass in the envelope turns out to be insignificant as compared to that of the core containing the most stiff material .    in order to implement this ` insignificant ' mass of the envelope component , crawford & demiaski ( 2003 ) have recently constructed the ns models for seven representative eoss of dense nuclear matter by covering a range of ns masses .",
    "they have computed the ` fractional moment of inertia ' of the core component which is defined as the glitch healing parameter , @xmath16 , in the starquake mechanism of glitch generation as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 represents the moment of inertia of the entire configuration .",
    "their study shows that the much larger values of @xmath19 for the crab pulsar are fulfilled by all but the six eoss considered in the study corresponding to a ` realistic ' neutron star mass range @xmath20 . on the other hand , for the much lower values of @xmath21 corresponding to the case of the vela pulsar , their models predict a ns mass @xmath22 which is too low as compared to the ` realistic ' ns mass range .",
    "thus , their study concludes the ` starquake ' as a feasible mechanism for glitch generation in the crab - like pulsars ( corresponding to a larger value of @xmath16 ) and the ` vortex unpinning ' , the another mechanism of glitch generation , suitable for the vela - like pulsars ( corresponding to a lower values of @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , it seems quite surprising that if the internal structure of nss is supposed to be described by the same two - component conventional model , then why different kinds of glitch mechanisms are required to explain a glitch !",
    "this is the purpose of this study to provide an insight about a fundamental ` theorem ' concerning the hydrostatic equilibrium of ns models ( which was laking in the earlier studies ) and to show that as soon as this theorem is implemented to an appropriate conventional ns sequence , the various shortcomings of the conventional ns models ( as mentioned above ) can be resolved .",
    "in order to construct such an appropriate sequence of ns models , consistent with causality and dynamical stability , we offer here an entirely different approach to the whole problem which will not only remove the ` abnormalities ' of the stiffest eos ( as discussed earlier in detail under section 1 ) but can also assure the _ necessary and sufficient _ condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for the resulting configuration . since , as we would show later in section 3 that the @xmath2 relations corresponding to the configurations ( i ) governed by the pure stiffest eos , and ( ii ) those resulting from the removal of ` abnormalities ' from the stiffest eos ( core - envelope models ) , do not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability unless the ` compatibility criterion ' ( negi & durgapal 2001 ) which states that : `` for each and every assigned value of @xmath23 the ratio of central pressure to central energy - density ] , the compactness ratio @xmath24 of the entire configuration should not exceed the compactness ratio , @xmath25 , of the corresponding homogeneous density sphere ( that is , @xmath26 ) '' is ` appropriately ' satisfied by such configurations .",
    "the present approach is based on the ` theorem ' applicable to a wide range of conventional ns sequences ( including the core - envelope models ) provided that every member of such sequences satisfies the condition @xmath27 ( here and elsewhere in the paper , the subscript ` 0 ' represents the value of the corresponding quantity at the centre of the configuration ) .",
    "this theorem asserts that in order to assure the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability for the mass , the maximum stable value of @xmath28 ( corresponding to the case of first maxima among masses in the mass - radius ( @xmath2 ) relation ) and the corresponding central value of ` local ' adiabatic index @xmath29(dp / de)_0)$ ] of such sequences must satisfy the inequalities , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively ( negi 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to the result of previous study regarding the ` compatibility criterion ' , we would show in the present study that `` the @xmath2 relation ( or the mass - central density relation ) corresponding to an equilibrium sequence provides the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability only when the ` compatibility criterion ' for the equilibrium sequence is also satisfied .",
    "but the fulfillment of the ` compatibility criterion ' does not depend upon the fulfillment of the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability provided by the @xmath2 relation '' .",
    "the proof of this statement would explicitly show that the fulfillment of ` compatibility criterion ' independently provides , in general , the necessary and sufficient condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for any sequence composed of regular configurations , since the first sentence of this statement has already been proved in the previous study for the equilibrium sequences of the type mentioned above ( negi 2007 ) .    in order to provide a proof of the last statement , the present paper deals with the construction of a four step consecutive study in the following manner    * step ( 1 ) :",
    "* we would construct the ns models corresponding to the pure stiffest eos , @xmath32 , and show that the @xmath2 relation corresponding to this sequence does not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability , since the ` compatibility criterion ' can not be fulfilled by the equilibrium configurations corresponding to this ` abnormal ' eos",
    ".    * step ( 2 ) : * we would construct the ns sequences composed of core - envelope models by considering the stiffest eos , @xmath32 , in the core and the eos of classical polytrope , d@xmath33d@xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the density of the rest - mass and @xmath36 is the constant adiabatic index ; see , e.g. tooper 1965 ) , in the envelope ( so that each member of these sequences satisfy the extreme case of causality condition , @xmath1 , at the centre ) for an ` arbitrarily ' assigned value of pressure to density ratio , @xmath37 ( say ) , at the core - envelope boundary . though this procedure removes the ` abnormalities ' from the stiffest eos , but as we would show later in sec.3 that the @xmath2 relation corresponding to the ns models with an envelope @xmath38 and 2 , do not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability , since the ` compatibility criterion ' remains unsatisfied by various stable ( as well as unstable ) models corresponding to the said sequences .",
    "* step ( 3 ) : * in this sub - section we would re - construct the ns sequence composed of core - envelope models as described in step ( 2 ) for the same boundary value of @xmath39 .",
    "but instead of the constant @xmath38 and 2 , the constant @xmath40 would be used for the envelope .",
    "we would show that although the ` compatibility criterion ' is satisfied by all stable ( as well as unstable ) models comprising the sequence but still , the @xmath2 relation does not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability , since the ` compatibility criterion ' is not ` appropriately ' satisfied by the equilibrium configurations",
    ".    * step ( 4 ) : * we would re - construct the ns sequences described in steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively for an ` appropriate ' boundary value of @xmath41 ( say ) .",
    "since for this particular value of @xmath42 , the ` compatibility criterion ' turns out to be ` appropriately ' satisfied by all the equilibrium sequences corresponding to an envelope with @xmath43 and 2 respectively , it would follow that the @xmath2 relation does provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability for the said sequences [ the value @xmath44 corresponds to the _ minimum _ value of @xmath42 for which the @xmath2 relation fulfills the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability for the equilibrium sequence corresponding to ns models with an envelope @xmath45 .",
    "since the value @xmath44 turns out to be greater than @xmath39 , it follows , therefore , that this particular value @xmath44 would guarantee the automatic fulfillment of the ` compatibility criterion ' for all the sequences corresponding to ns models with an envelope @xmath43 and 2 respectively , together with fulfilling the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability provided by the @xmath2 relation .",
    "this condition is termed as the ` appropriate ' fulfillment of ` compatibility criterion ' . ] .    the methodology regarding the construction of various models mentioned in steps ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) above and the important outcome emerging thereafter",
    "are discussed in the following section .",
    "the assignment of different values of @xmath36 between the range ( 4/3 ) and 2 in the envelope of ns models discussed under step ( 2 ) to step ( 4 ) above follows from the fact that ( 4/3 ) represents the eos of ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons and non - relativistic nuclei ( chandrasekhar 1935 ) or of relativistic degenerate neutron gas ( zeldovich & novikov 1978 ) .",
    "( 5/3 ) corresponds to the well known eos of non - relativistic degenerate neutrons gas ( oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 ) and @xmath45 represents the case of extreme relativistic baryons interacting through vector meson field ( zeldovich 1962 ) [ the value of @xmath46 is also possible for some eos , e.g. , malone , johnson & bethe ( 1975 ) ; clark , heintzmann & grewing ( 1971 ) , however , the results obtained in this paper do not get affected by choosing @xmath46 ] .",
    "the various values of @xmath36 chosen in this range ( @xmath48 ) can cover almost all of the nuclear eos discussed in the literature ( and , therefore , it can cover almost full range of nuclear density which might be applicable for the envelope region as well ) , and in our opinion , it could be more appropriate to choose an average ( constant ) value of @xmath36 for a conventional ns model , instead of going into the details of the density range below @xmath49 specified by different eos [ for example , bps , nv , or fps ( lorenz , ravenhall & pethick 1993 ) ] which are frequently used by various authors in the conventional models of neutron stars in - spite of their uncertainty ( friedman & ipser 1987 ; dolan 1992 ) as mentioned earlier .",
    "the eos of classical polytrope for the said @xmath36 values , considered in the present study , will not only simplify the procedure but also provide necessary insight regarding the suitability of the eos for the envelope region , since this study yields the important finding that the stable sequences of neutron star models terminate at the same value of maximum mass independent of the eos of the envelope .",
    "the metric for spherically symmetric and static configurations can be written in the following form ( remembering that we are using geometrized units , i.e. @xmath50 ; where @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent respectively , the universal constant of gravitation and the speed of light in vacuum ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are functions of @xmath56 alone .",

    "may be calculated by using an approximate but very precise empirical formula which is based on 30 theoretical eoss of dense nuclear matter . for ns models ,",

    "@xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown in table 1 and the @xmath2 diagram is presented in fig.1 .",

    "it follows , therefore , that the @xmath2 relation corresponding to the stiffest eos does not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability for the equilibrium configurations . since",

    "the important conclusions emerge from the four step study and discussion presented above may be summarized in the following manner :    \\(1 ) steps ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) show that the @xmath2 relation provides the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability only when the ` compatibility criterion ' for the equilibrium configurations is satisfied . without satisfying the ` compatibility criterion ' , the @xmath2 relation can not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability .",

    ", the fulfillment of ` compatibility criterion ' is quite independent of the fulfillment of necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability provided by the @xmath2 relation , because the ` compatibility criterion ' can be made satisfied even without fulfilling the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability provided by the @xmath2 relation . since , the fulfillment of the ` compatibility criterion ' alone is a measure of the fulfillment of necessary and sufficient condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for any static and spherical configuration ( negi 2007 ) , it follows from the above discussion that the fulfillment of the ` compatibility criterion ' alone , independently provides , in general , the necessary and sufficient condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for any sequence composed of regular , static and spherical configurations .",
    "we have investigated that the mass - radius relation corresponding to the stiffest equation of state does not provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability because at the maximum value of mass along the mass - radius relation , the pair of the maximum ` stable ' value of compactness , @xmath69 , and the corresponding central value of the ` local ' adiabatic index , @xmath70 , turns out to be inconsistent with that of the pair of _ absolute _ values , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , compatible with the structure of general relativity , causality , and dynamical stability .",
    "the reason behind this inconsistency lies in the fact that the ` compatibility criterion ' ( negi and durgapal 2001 ) can not be fulfilled by any of the sequence , composed of regular configurations corresponding to a _",
    "single _ eos with finite ( non - zero ) values of surface and central density ( negi 2004 ; 2006 ) .",
    "we have further constructed the sequences composed of core - envelope models such that , like the stiffest eos , each member of these sequences satisfy the extreme case of causality condition , @xmath1 , at the centre by considering the stiffest equation of state in the core and a polytropic equation with the constant adiabatic index @xmath116d@xmath117d@xmath118 $ ] in the envelope and investigated the resulting configurations on the basis of the ` compatibility criterion ' and the mass - radius relation for different values of @xmath43 and 2 .",
    "together with the finding corresponding to the case of stiffest eos mentioned above , the investigation of the said sequences of the core - envelope models explicitly show that the mass - radius relation corresponding to the said sequences can provide the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical stability only when the ` compatibility criterion ' for the sequences in ` appropriately ' satisfied .",

    "these results explicitly show that the ` compatibility criterion ' _ independently _ provides , in general , the _ necessary _ and _ sufficient _ condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for any regular sequence .",
    "the causal sequences of ns models constructed in the present study ( which fulfill the necessary and sufficient condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical stability simultaneously ) terminate at the same value of maximum mass , @xmath119 ( for @xmath120 g @xmath66 ) , independent of the eos of the envelope .",

    "the sequence corresponding to an envelope with @xmath40 , however , yields the maximum mass @xmath137 for the vela pulsar ( @xmath105 ) but it does not provide the minimum stable mass for the crab pulsar as soon as the constraint of @xmath138 is imposed .",
    "the higher mass values mentioned in the last paragraph for the crab pulsar seem to be unlikely , since none of the observational and/or the theoretical study predict such higher mass values for the crab pulsar .",
    "thus , unlike the results of steps 2 - 3 ( section 3 ) which deal with the study of ns models without implementing the ` appropriate ' fulfillment of ` compatibility criterion ' , the implementation of the ` appropriate ' fulfillment of ` compatibility criterion ' also reveals that in order to construct a ` realistic ' ns sequence composed of ns masses comparable with those of the observations , we have to modify the value of matching density at the core - envelope boundary . in view of the modern eoss of dense nuclear matter ,",
    "the upper bound on ns mass compatible with causality and dynamical stability can reach up to a value as large as @xmath139 , since among the variety of modern eoss discussed in the literature only the following eoss yield the maximum mass of ns model in excess of 2@xmath140 : sly ( douchin & haensel 2001 ) eos , @xmath141 ; bgn1 ( balberg & gal 1997 ) eos , @xmath142 ; and apr ( akmal et .",
    "al . 1998 ) eos , @xmath143 ( see ,",
    "e.g. haensel et al 2006 ) .",
    "however , on the basis of other modern eoss for ns matter , fitted to experimental nucleon - nucleon scattering data and the properties of light nuclei , kalogera & baym ( 1996 ; and references therein ) have also shown that the lowest possible upper bound on ns mass , compatible with causality and dynamical stability , corresponds to the value of @xmath144 which can exceed up to a value as large as @xmath145 . considering their mean @xmath146 as the most likely recent value to the upper bound on ns masses and substituting this value as an upper bound to our models mentioned in step 4 of section 3 , we obtain the ` appropriate ' value of matching density @xmath147 g @xmath66 at the core - envelope boundary . on the basis of this density , our re - constructed sequences ( corresponding to an envelope with @xmath38 and 2 respectively ) yield the maximum masses @xmath148 for the vela ( @xmath105 ) and the minimum masses @xmath149 for the crab ( @xmath150 pulsar as shown in fig.6 .",
    "the sequence corresponding to an envelope with @xmath40 , however , yields the maximum mass @xmath151 for the vela pulsar ( @xmath105 ) but as shown in fig.6 , the minimum mass of the crab pulsar ( @xmath152 ) belongs to the unstable branch of the sequence as soon as the constraint of @xmath138 is imposed . obviously , the other conclusions of the present study , drawn on the basis of assigning the fiduciary density @xmath153 g @xmath66 at the boundary will remain unaltered .",
