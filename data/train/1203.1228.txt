    "a major breakthrough in the study of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) was the discovery of their x - ray afterglow by the beppo - sax satellite ( costa , e. et al .",
    "1997 ) , which led to their localization and consequently to the discovery of their longer wave - length afterglows ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 , frail & kulkarni  1997 ) , which were predicted ( paczynski & roads 1993 , katz 1994 , mezaros & rees 1997 ) by the fireball model of grbs ( paczynski 1986 , goodman 1986 ) . until the launch of the swift satellite , the fireball model was widely accepted as the correct model of grbs and their afterglows ( see , e.g. , the reviews by meszaros  2002 , zhang & meszaros  2004 , piran  2004 ) . the rich data on grbs and their afterglows obtained in recent years with the swift and fermi satellites complemented by data from ground - based rapid response telescopes and large follow - up telescopes , however , have challenged this prevailing view ( see , e.g. , dar  2006 and the publications of dado et al . cited in this paper and references therein ;",
    "margutti et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , the cannonball model ( cb ) of grbs ( dar & de rjula 2004 and references therein ) has been very successful in reproducing also the detailed light - curves of grbs and their ags that were measured with the swift and fermi satellites ( see , e.g. , dado et al .",
    "2009a , b ) .",
    "this success required adjustment of the free parameters of the cb model to fit the data , which could have made one wonder whether the good agreement between theory and observations was due to the flexibility of the model rather than to its validity .",
    "the cb model , however , has been used also to predict universal properties of grbs and their afterglows _ before their discovery by observations _ , which do not depend on free or adjustable parameters . for the prompt emission ,",
    "these included the large linear polarization of the prompt gamma rays ( e.g. , shaviv & dar 1995 ) , the rapid spectral softening that accompanied the fast decline of the prompt @xmath4-ray emission ( see , e.g. , dado et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) , and several correlations among grb observables ( see , e.g. , dar & de rjula  2000 , dado & dar  2012 and references therein ) including the amati relation ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) .    as for the afterglow emission ,",
    "the cb model predicted the appearance of an underlying supernova in the optical ag of relatively nearby long duration grbs ( see , e.g. , dar 1999 , dado et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 and references therein ) , the canonical behaviour of x - ray light - curves - the transition to a plateau phase after a fast decline with a rapid softening of the prompt emission spectral energy density ( sed ) that bends / breaks smoothly into an asymptotic power - law decline ( e.g. , dado et al .",
    "2002 , dar & de rjula  2004 ) - before it was discovered with swift ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the chromatic behaviour of the broad - band ( xuvonir ) afterglow at early time ( e.g. , covino et al .  2006 ) that becomes achromatic well after the smooth bend / break time with roughly a universal spectral index @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we have used the cb model to derive another universal feature of the late - time broad band ( xuvonir ) afterglow of grbs , which does not involve adjustable parameters .",
    "namely , we show that in the cb model the observed pectral energy density of the _ late - time _",
    "afterglow declines with time and frequency , like @xmath6 where the difference between the temporal and spectral power - law indexes can have one of the values @xmath7=0 , 1/2 or 1 .",
    "this closure relation then was tested using the 0.3 - 10 kev light - curves of the x - ray afterglow of 315 swift grbs , which were measured accurately enough well beyond 1 day with the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "the cb model best fits to the entire available data of their x - ray afterglows were used to extract the values of their late - time temporal index @xmath1 , while the values of their spectral index @xmath2 were those inferred by the swift team from the spectrum of the time integrated x - ray afterglow .",
    "in the cb model ( see , e.g. , dar & de rjula 2004 , dado et al .  2002 , 2009a and references therein ) grbs and their afterglows",
    "are produced by the interaction of bipolar jets of highly relativistic plasmoids ( cbs ) of ordinary matter with the radiation and matter along their trajectory ( shaviv & dar 1995 , dar 1998 ) .",
    "such jetted cbs are presumably ejected in accretion episodes on the newly formed compact stellar object in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions ( dar et al .  1992 , dar & plaga  1999 , dar & de rjula  2000 ) , in the merger of compact objects in close binary systems ( goodman et al .  1987 , shaviv & dar 1995 ) and in mass accretion episodes in microquasars and phase transitions in compact stars ( dar  1998 , dado et al . 2009b ) .    in the cb model , the circumburst medium in front of a highly relativistic cb is completely ionized by the radiation from the cb .",
    "in the cb s rest frame , the ions of the medium that are continuously impinging on the cb generate within it a turbulent magnetic field , whose energy density is assumed to be in approximate equipartition with that of the impinging particles , @xmath8 ( e.g. , dado et al . 2002 ) , where @xmath9 is the external baryon density and @xmath10 is the proton mass .",
    "the electrons that enter the cb with a relative lorentz factor @xmath11 in the cb s rest frame are fermi accelerated there to a smoothly broken power - law distribution in @xmath12 with a break around @xmath11 and a power - law index @xmath13 well above it .",
    "these electrons cool rapidly by emission of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) .",
    "this sr is isotropic in the cb s rest frame and has a smoothly broken power - law with a characteristic break frequency @xmath14 , which is the typical synchrotron frequency radiated by the interstellar medium ( ism ) electrons that enter the cb at time @xmath15 with a lorentz factor @xmath16 . in the observer frame ,",
    "the emitted photons are beamed into a narrow cone along the cb s direction of motion by its highly relativistic bulk motion , their arrival times are aberrated and their energies are boosted by its bulk motion doppler factor @xmath17 and redshifted by the cosmic expansion during their travel time to the observer .",

    "2009a ) , @xmath18 ^ 3 \\delta(t)\\ , ,   \\label{nub}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is its doppler factor with @xmath20 being the angle between the line of sight to the cb and its direction of motion . for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 to an excellent approximation .",
    "the spectral energy density of the _ unabsorbed _ sr afterglow has the form ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( 26 ) in dado et al .",

    "the photon spectral index of the unabsorbed x - ray afterglow and the photon spectral index of the emitted radiation is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the intercepted ism particles that are swept into the cb decelerates its motion . for a cb of a baryon number @xmath32 , a radius @xmath33 and an initial lorentz factor @xmath34 , which propagates in an ism of a constant density @xmath9 , relativistic energy - momentum conservation for plastic collisions yields the deceleration law ( dado et al .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , for a constant - density ism , the shape of the light - curve of the ag depends on only three parameters : the product @xmath38 , the deceleration time scale @xmath39 and the spectral index @xmath40 .",
    "as long as @xmath41 , @xmath16 and consequently @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath40 change rather slowly with @xmath15 and generate the plateau phase of @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , eq .",

    "such a canonical behviour of the x - ray afterglow of grbs is demonstrated in figure 1 where the 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray light - curve of grb 060729 that was measured with the swift xrt is plotted together with its cb model best fit light - curve .",
    "often the break of the x - ray afterglow of very luminous grbs is hidden under the prompt grb emission or its fast decline phase ( this happens because @xmath54 is rather large and @xmath55 ^ 2\\ll 1 $ ] yielding a rather small @xmath56 ) . in such grbs",
    "the `` late - time '' power - law decline of the x - ray ag begins right after the fast decline of the prompt emission with the canonical late - time temporal index @xmath57 ( dado et al .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 2 where the light - curve of the x - ray afterglow of grb 061007 that was measured with the swift xrt is plotted together with its cb - model best fit light - curve .",
    "consider now a cb that encounters a wind - like density profile @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "for simplicity , let us set the encounter time to be @xmath60 in the observer frame .",
    "as long as the cb has not yet swept in a relativistic mass comparable to its mass , @xmath4 and @xmath17 change rather slowly as a function of time and stay put at their values at @xmath60 .",

    "( dado et al .",
    "a grb produced near the center of an elliptical galaxy may have an x - ray afterglow with such a late - time behaviour .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 4 where we plotted the light - curve of the x - ray afterglow of the short grb 060414 and its cb model best fit light - curve .    in the cb model ,",
    "the prompt emission pulses are produced by different cbs which , for simplicity , are assumed to be emitted in the same direction .",
    "the time resolution during the afterglow phase is usually much longer than the time separation between the prompt grb pulses , i.e. , the separation between the cbs emission times , which , coupled with the initial fast expansion of the cbs and their merger due to the deceleration of the leading one in the ism , allow us to consider them as a single blob during the afterglow phase ( see e.g. dar & de rjula 2004 ) , which we have so far done .",
    "however , if the ejecta has a `` shot gun '' distribution , i.e. , consist of many ( @xmath64 ) cbs , which are spread within a small angle angle @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , then one must integrate their contribution taking into account their different viewing angles . in the limit of a uniform angular distribution of cbs within an angle @xmath65 ( namely , an angular density @xmath67 ) and neglecting the spread in arrival times from different cbs at late time , the simple integration of eq .",

    "these results are valid also for observers slightly off - axis because the integration over viewing angle is dominated by the contribution from cbs moving near the line of sight . in figure 5",
    "we have plotted the 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray afterglow of grb 110808a that was retrieved from the swift / xrt light - curve repository ( evans et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) and its cb - model best fit light - curve assuming a shot - gun configuration of cbs .    all together",
    ", the cb model predicts that the late - time temporal decay of the grb afterglow is well approximated by power - law with a power - law index @xmath71 that is simplly related to the spectral index @xmath25 of the late - time afterglow .",
    "in particular it predicts that error - free measurements of the late - time @xmath0 , must yield a triple - peak distribution with narrow peaks around 0 , 1/2 and 1 provided that the circumburst environments are well represented by the assumed constant density ism or a wind - like density profile .",
    "note , however , that while the cb model predicts a triple peak distribution of @xmath72 at late time , it predicts a single - peak distribution of the late - time @xmath73 around 1.083 and a late - time power - law decay of @xmath50 with a temporal index that is peaked around @xmath74 ( e.g. , dar and de rjula 2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "reliable and accurate values of the temporal and spectral power - law indexes @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the late - time x - ray afterglow measured with the swif xrt , which are reported in the swift / xrt light - curve repository ( evans et al . 2007 , 2009 ) , often are difficult to obtain because of one or more of the following reasons : + ( a ) the xrt measurements often run out of statistics or approach the background level before @xmath1 reaches its late - time constant value . + ( b ) temporal gaps in the late - time data .",

    "+ ( d ) a too simplistic model of extragalactic absorption restricted to the host galaxy whose chemical composition is taken to be solar and independent of redshift , that is used to infer @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , grbs without known redshift are treated as grbs at redshift z = 0 .    before the launch of the swift satellite , the knowledge of the x - ray afterglow of grbs was incomplete and its inferred behaviour from limited and patchy data appeared to agree with the fireball model predictions ( meszaros and rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) . after the launch of the swift satellite it became rather clear that the observed properties and the diversity of the measured x - ray - afterglows , both at early and late times , challenge the fireball model paradigm ( see , e.g. , dar 2006 and the other publications of dado et al .",
    "cited in the bibliography , and the references therein ) .",
    "this led to empirical parametrizations of ag light - curves such as smoothly broken power - laws ( e.g. , beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ) exponential to power - law functions ( e.g. , willingale et al . 2007 ) , and smoothly broken segmented power - laws ( e.g. , margutti et al .",
    "2012 ) , which have never been derived from an underlying physical model . in most cases it was possible to fit reasonably well the observational data by introducing sufficient number of free adjustable parameters .",
    "however , because of difficulties ( a)-(d ) and the scarcity of late - time data it was not clear whether the extrapolation of these fits to late times yields reliable values of the late - time ( asymptotic ) @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the cb model light - curves summarized in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) , which were derived in fair approximations from the underlying assumptions of the cb model , were shown to describe very well the observed x - ray light - curves of the x - ray ags of a large sample ( over 150 ) of swift grbs with known redshift , including those with superimposed early - time and late- time flares ( see , e.g. , dado et al .",
    "2009a , b ; dado and dar 2010 and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", their underlying smooth component was fitted very well by eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) only with three adjustable parameters , @xmath76 , @xmath56 and @xmath77 and the properly chosen circumburst environment ( a constant density or a wind - like density profile ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in figures 1 - 6 .",
    "thus , in order to avoid difficulties ( a)-(d ) and empirical parametrizations of the x - ray ag , we have extracted the late - time temporal slope @xmath1 from the asymptotic power - law behaviour as given by eqs .",
    "( 4)-(6 ) of the cannonball model fits to the entire x - ray light - curve moreover , since the late - time behaviour of the x - ray ag is independent of redshift , we have extended our fits to all the 315 x - ray light - curves that were reported in the swift / xrt light - curve repository ( evans et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) before august 1 , 2012 , with or without known redshift , whose measured 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray ag extended beyond 1 day and the reported error in their inferred spectral index is @xmath3 .",
    "the typical error in the values of @xmath1 obtained from the cb model fits to the entire 0.3 - 10 kev light - curve of the x - ray ag of the swift grbs was much smaller than the typical error in the inferred value of @xmath75 that was reported in the swift / xrt light - curve repository ( evans et al .",
    "2007,2009 ) .",
    "we caution that the values of the late - time @xmath1 that were obtained from the cb model best fit light - curves of the entire x - ray afterglow may differ significantly from those obtained from empirical parametrizations of the light - curves and arbitrary selection of time intervals .",
    "for instance , the cb model best fit light - curve of the smooth 0.3 - 10 kev light - curve of the x - ray afterglow of grb 090618 that is shown in figure 6 , yielded @xmath78 , @xmath79 s and @xmath80 i.e. , a late - time @xmath81 ( @xmath82 for dof=1301 ) while a smoothly broken power - law ( beuermann et al . 1999 ) fit yields @xmath83 , a break time @xmath84 d and a late - time @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",

    "2007 , 2009 ) , but is inconsistent with the value inferred from the smoothly broken power - law parametrization of the ag .    in figure 7",

    "their distribution is shown in figure 8 . as can be seen from figures 7 and 8 , their distribution peaks around the canonical value @xmath91 of the cannonball model , which is represented by the horizontal and vertical lines , respectively , in figures 7 and 8 .    in figure 9",
