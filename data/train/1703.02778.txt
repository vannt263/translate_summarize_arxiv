    "we consider the systematic numerical approximation of a class of allen - cahn type equations describing , for instance , the motion of anti - phase boundaries in crystalline solids @xcite , the evolution of interfaces in more general phase field models @xcite , or the geometric evolution by mean curvature @xcite . for motivation of our considerations ,",
    "let us briefly consider two particular examples which have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "as a first model problem , we consider the generalized allen - cahn equation @xmath0 here @xmath1 is an order parameter which takes values close to zero in one phase of the medium and close to one in the other , @xmath2 is the double well potential , @xmath3 is a source term due to external loading , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are model parameters .",
    "the coefficient @xmath6 plays the role of a regularization parameter that allows to widen the transition zone between the phases and thus to alleviate the numerical simulation . for the choice @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , one obtains the standard allen - cahn equation @xmath11 which has been studied intensively in the literature",
    "; see e.g. @xcite and the references given there .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that , and therefore also , can be understood as a gradient flow for an associated free energy functional , which for the problem has the form @xmath12 the multiplicative term @xmath13 on the right hand side of yields a scaling of time that leads to a non - trivial behavior for @xmath14 , which is called the _ sharp interface limit_. it is shown in @xcite that the velocity of the interface @xmath15 can be expanded as @xmath16 \\cdot n_\\gamma + c \\lambda^{1/2 } \\kappa_{\\gamma } + o(\\mu^{1/2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 can be expressed expicitly in terms of the problem data .",
    "$ ] denotes the jump of the eshelby tensor @xcite which is related to the external forces @xmath3 and @xmath19 is the normal vector while @xmath20 is the mean curvature of the interface @xmath21 . in the limit @xmath14 , the velocity of the interface motion",
    "can thus be described by the well - known relation @xcite @xmath22 \\cdot n_\\gamma + c \\lambda^{1/2 } \\kappa_{\\gamma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] choosing the regularization parameter @xmath23 leads to an incorrect speed of the interface motion , and according to , one should choose @xmath24 to keep the consistency error small .",
    "for parameter @xmath23 the interface is widened to a transition zone of width @xmath25 . in order to resolve the smoothed interface in simulations , the mesh size should therefore be chosen at least as small as @xmath26 .",
    "more restrictive assumptions on the mesh size are required to really prove a good approximation of the interface evolution ; see @xcite for details . if @xmath5 is small , then a very small mesh size is thus required to obtain a good approximation .    in order to allow for a larger mesh size and to reduce the computational burden ,",
    "the following model for the interface motion has been proposed and analyzed in @xcite @xmath27 this equation , which has been termed _",
    "hybrid model _ in @xcite , describes the motion of the levelsets of the order parameter @xmath28 with normal speed proportional to the term in parenthesis . following the arguments of @xcite",
    ", the problem can again be interpreted as a gradient flow for an associated energy functional , which here reads @xmath29 the gradient here has to be defined with respect to a metric induced by the solution @xmath30 itselve ; we refer to @xcite and to section  [ sec : variational ] for details . using asymptotic analysis ,",
    "the propagation speed of the interface has been shown in @xcite to behave like @xmath31 \\cdot n + \\nu^{1/2 } \\omega_1 \\kappa_\\gamma + o(\\nu^{1/2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath32 can again be computed from the model data .",
    "a comparison of the two formulas and reveals that for a proper choice of the model and scaling parameters , the hybrid model leads to the same propagation speed for the interface @xmath21 as in the allen - cahn model up to higher order terms . to obtain a good agreement of the results",
    ", one should choose @xmath33 and in this case width of the smoothed interface in the hybrid model can be shown to behave like @xmath34 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "when @xmath5 is small , the smoothed interface of the hybrid model is thus substantially larger then that of the corresponding allen - cahn model and a mesh size of @xmath35 should be sufficient to resolve the interface in computations , instead of @xmath36 required for the corresponding allen - cahn model .",
    "the hybrid model should therefore allow to compute the interface evolution on a much coarser mesh , which was the main motivation for the proposal of this method .",
    "due to the close connection to mean curvature flow , there has been much interest in the numerical approximation for the allen - cahn equation .",
    "various discretization schemes have been proposed and analyzed , see e.g. @xcite and the references given there .",
    "particular aspects of the efficient numerical approximation have been addressed in @xcite and a - posteriori error estimates have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the convergence of numerical approximations of the allen - cahn equation in the sharp interface limit @xmath37 towards the generalized motion by mean curvature has been established in @xcite ; see also @xcite for further numerical tests .",
    "the direct numerical approximation of mean curvature flow has also been investigated intensively ; see for instance @xcite and refer to @xcite for a review about available results and further references .",
    "the focus of the current manuscript is somewhat different to these previous works : here we want to study the systematic numerical approximation of a large class of allen - cahn type models which includes , , and as special cases .",
    "the common feature of all these models is the underlying gradient flow structure with respect to an associated energy functional , and we aim to strictly preserve this structure in the approximation process on the semi - discrete and the fully discrete level . with this in mind , we automatically obtain discretization schemes that are uniformly energy stable and thus consistent with the second law of thermodynamics . in this paper",
    "we establish well - posedness and qualitative properties of a discretization strategy appropriate for a large class of allen - cahn type problems .",
    "the models and introduced above will be considered as particular examples . as a by - product of our investigations",
    ", we also obtain further numerical evidence for the asymptotic expansions and of the interface velocities .",
    "our main arguments can be extended to elastic allen - cahn type models which describe the evolution of phase interfaces in binary alloys @xcite .",
    "the required coupling to the additional elasticity system will be investigated in a forth - comming publication .",
    "the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : variational ] , we first introduce a unified formulation of the problems discussed in the introduction and then present a variational characterization of smooth solutions . in addition , we verify that the respective energies decrease along solution trajectories which is due to the underlying gradient flow structure . in section  [ sec : galerkin ] , we then discuss the galerkin approximation of the underlying variational principles .",
    "we establish the well - posedness of the resulting semi - discrete schemes and verify the energy decay on the discrete level . in section  [ sec : time ] , we then discuss the subsequent discretization in time by a problem adapted implicit time stepping scheme .",
    "we establish the well - posedness of the fully discrete problem and again prove the decay in energy . a particular space discretization by finite elements is discussed in seciton  [ sec : implementation ] , and some further aspects of the implementation are presented . for illustration of our theoretical results ,",
    "we report in section  [ sec : numerics ] about some numerical tests , in which we also verify the asymptotic expansions for the interface velocities given in and .",
    "we close with a short discussion of our results and open problems for future research .",
    "for the rest of the manuscript , we consider the following general model problem : @xmath38 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a bounded lipschitz domain , @xmath41 are model parameters , and the functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 are given a - priori . for our analysis",
    "later on , we will assume that    * @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; * @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "some of these technical assumptions are made only for convenience and could further be relaxed without problems .",
    "this will become clear from our analysis below and we will make some remarks in this direction . to complete the model description , we additionally assume that @xmath51 other boundary conditions can also be treated without much difficulty .",
    "the above problem is of quasilinear parabolic type and existence of solutions for appropriate initial values @xmath52 can be proven with standard arguments ; see e.g. @xcite .",

    "note that acording to our definition , smooth solutions and their spatial derivatives are uniformly bounded .",
    "the allen - cahn model can be phrased in the form by setting @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and defining the potential as @xmath60 .",
    "note that the second derivative @xmath61 of the potential is unbounded here . using maximum principles ,",
    "the solution @xmath30 can however be shown to remain bounded and therefore @xmath62 could be modified for large @xmath30 in order to satisfy ( a2 ) without changing the solution ; see @xcite for other appropriate conditions on the potential .",
    "the hybrid model can also be cast into the form with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . to avoid problems for vanishing gradient",
    ", one can set @xmath67 for some @xmath68 instead , and thus obtain a regularized version of .",
    "the limit @xmath69 may be studied in the framework of @xmath21-convergence @xcite .    as a next step ,",
    "let us define an associated energy functional for the problem  by @xmath70 equation can then be interpreted as a gradient flow for this energy with respect to the metric @xmath71 .",
    "problem can thus be formally expressed as @xmath72 which , following @xcite , has to be understood in the sense that @xmath73 for all @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the last term is the negative directional derivative of the energy functional in direction @xmath76 .",

    "motivated by the results of the previous section , we now consider the galerkin approximation of the variational principle to construct semi - discretizations in space .",

    "[ lem : decayh ] let @xmath95 denote a solution of problem  [ prob : semi ] .",

    "this implies that @xmath99 remains uniformly bounded and hence the solution can be extended uniquely to arbitrarily large @xmath75 .    under assumptions ( a1)(a2 )",

    "let us note that the energy decay estimate also provides a uniform bound for the time derivative of the solution which might be useful for a full convergence analysis for the galerkin approximation ; we refer to @xcite for results in this direction .",
    "as a second step in the approximation process , let us now discuss the discretization in time . given some time step @xmath116",

    "the second term on the right hand side of the above energy estimate stems from numerical dissipation of the implicit time - stepping scheme .",
