    "classical stability arguments require the presence of an additional term in the nonlinear @xmath1-model lagrangian @xcite ; this term was introduced initially by skyrme . in this scenario , baryons emerge as solitonic solutions of the euler - lagrange equations @xcite , which are highly nonlinear second order equations and can not be solved in exact closed form .",
    "solutions are obtained by numerical integration .",
    "this is an awkward situation for the evaluation of physical quantitie s. in practice it is more convenient to have explicit approximate representations for the solitonic solutions .    in the present work",
    "we obtain reliable approximate representations for the solution of the skyrme model in the @xmath3 sector by means of the pad approximant ( pa ) @xcite procedure whereby the series expansion solution of the differential equations is continued analytically .",
    "the successful implementation of pa summation relies on the simple structure of the series solution near the origin which is almost an alternate geometric series . in order to reproduce the essential features of the exact solution at large distances",
