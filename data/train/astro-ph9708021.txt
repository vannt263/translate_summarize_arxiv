    "16.00truecm    observational data on galaxy clustering are rapidly increasing in both quantity and quality , which brings new challenges when it comes to data analysis . as to quantity",
    ", redshifts had been published for a few thousand galaxies 15 years ago . today",
    "the number is @xmath4 , and ongoing projects such as the aat 2df survey and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) will raise it to @xmath5 within a few years .",
    "comprehensive reviews of past redshift surveys are given by efstathiou ( 1994 ) , vogeley ( 1995 ) , strauss & willick ( 1995 ) and strauss ( 1996 ) , the last also including a detailed description of 2df and sdss .",
    "as to quality , more accurate and uniform photometric selection criteria ( enabled by the well - calibrated 5-band photometry of the sdss ) reduce potential systematic errors .",
    "this increased data quality makes it desirable to avoid approximations in the data analysis process and to use methods that can constrain cosmological quantities as accurately as possible , without bias . here",
    "we will focus on how to correct for the finite volume of a survey .",
    "as is well known , this causes the measured power spectrum to be a convolution of the true power spectrum with some window function which depends on the survey geometry and the data analysis method used .",
    "exact expressions have been derived ( see feldman , kaiser & peacock 1994 , hereafter `` fkp '' ) for the window function and its normalization for the case where the number density of galaxies is assumed to be known _ a priori _ , but the more realistic case where the mean galaxy density is determined from the survey itself has thus far only been treated approximately ( peacock & nicholson 1991 ; park 1994 ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive exact expressions for this important correction .    the methods for power spectrum estimation that have been proposed in the literature fall into two categories :    1 .",
    "direct fourier methods 2 .",
    "pixelized methods    the direct fourier methods make use of the exact position of each galaxy , whereas the other methods start by  pixelizing \" the data set ( by computing counts in cells or expansion coefficients for some set of functions ) , thereby reducing the problem to manipulating large vectors and matrices . in section  [ traditionalsec ] , we will derive the finite - volume correction for direct fourier methods .",
    "the corresponding correction for pixelized methods is given in section  [ pixelizedsec ] .",
    "it is customary ( see fkp ) to model the observed galaxy distribution as a 3d poisson process @xmath6 with intensity @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath8 is the selection function of the galaxy survey under consideration , , @xmath9 is the expected ( not the observed ) number of galaxies in a volume @xmath10 about @xmath11 .",
    "the density fluctuations @xmath12 are modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic ( but not necessarily gaussian ) random field with power spectrum @xmath0 , and the power spectrum estimation problem is to estimate @xmath0 given a realization of @xmath13 .",
    "due to space limitations , the method summary below is very brief , and the interested reader is referred to fkp and tegmark ( 1995 , hereafter  t95 \" ) for more detailed introductions to the various methods .",
    "all direct fourier methods not involving random numbers are specified by choosing a weight function @xmath14 in real space and a set of weights @xmath15 in fourier space , as defined below .",
    "they all involve the following two steps :    1 .   at a grid of points @xmath16 in fourier space ,",
    "fluctuation amplitudes are estimated by ( _ i ) & & ( ) e^-i_i d^3 r + & = & _ j ( _ j)(_j)e^-i_i_j - ( _ i ) .",
    "( here and throughout , hats denote fourier transforms . ) 2 .",
    "the power @xmath17 at some given @xmath18-value , say @xmath19 , is estimated by squaring these fluctuation amplitudes , subtracting off their shot noise bias , rescaling them to correct for the integral constraint , and averaging them with some weights @xmath15 that add up to unity : ( k _ * ) _ i w_i .    as we will show in section  [ tradderivationsec ] , the new and exact expressions for the shot noise and integral constraint corrections ( when @xmath8 is normalized so that @xmath20 ) are ^2()&=&(1+|()()|^2)c_s(0 ) - 2\\{()^*()^ * c_s ( ) } , + [ normdefeq ] n()&=&(1+|()()|^2)f(0 ) - 2\\{()^*()^ * f ( ) } , where the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined by c_s()&&e^-id^3r , + f()&&()^2 e^-id^3r .",
    "if the survey is volume limited , then @xmath8 is independent of @xmath11 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "four different choices of the galaxy weighting function @xmath25 have appeared in the literature : ( ) & = & \\{. + [ apmeq ] ( ) & = & ( ) + [ fkpeq ] ( ) & = & ( ) 1+()p + [ t95eq ] ( ) & = & .",
    "the first choice , , weighing all galaxies in a survey volume equally , was employed by fisher ( 1993 ) .",
    "the second choice was used for the apm survey ( baugh & efstathiou 1994 )  since redshifts were not measured , the radial galaxy weighting by default became the selection function ( moreover , modes could of course only be computed in the directions perpendicular to the line of sight ) .",
    "the third choice is that advocated by feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 , hereafter fkp ) , where @xmath17 denotes an _ a priori _ guess as to the power in the band under consideration , and minimizes the variance in the limit when @xmath26 the depth of the survey .",
    "the fourth choice corresponds to the method of t95 , and gives the narrowest window function for a given variance ( the constant @xmath27 determines the tradeoff ) .      as to the weights in fourier space , @xmath15 ,",
    "a common choice ( fkp ) is to perform a straight average of all modes in a spherical shell with its radius centered on @xmath19 , although when the survey volume is anisotropic , a weighted average giving smaller error bars can generally be obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem ( t95 ) .",
    "the expectation value of a power estimate @xmath28 that has been corrected for the shot noise bias and the integral constraint can always be written as = w(k ) p(k ) dk , where the function @xmath29 , known as the _ window function _ , has the property that _ 0^w(k)dk=1 .",
    "we can therefore think of @xmath30 as measuring a weighted average of the true power spectrum , with @xmath29 specifying the weights ( for most methods , but not all , these weights are strictly non - negative as well ) .",
    "the window function for a general direct fourier method is derived in section  [ tradderivationsec ] , and is found to be ( k ) _",
    "i w_i |_i()|^2 k^2 d_k , where @xmath31 is given by and the angular @xmath32-integral is carried out over a spherical shell of radius @xmath18 . in the limit where @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the smallest survey dimension , the 3d window function simplifies to @xmath35 .",
    "if we knew the selection function @xmath36 _ a priori _ , before counting the galaxies in our survey , we would be able to probe the power on the largest scales . for modes of wavelength much larger than the survey volume",
    ", this would essentially correspond to counting the difference between the observed and expected number of galaxies in our sample .",
    "of course , we do not know @xmath8 _ a priori _ , so our most accurate way of normalizing the selection function is by using the galaxies in the survey itself .",
    "when @xmath8 is normalized in this way , naive application of will give the artifact @xmath37 as @xmath38 because fluctuations on the scale of the survey are forced to zero by definition ( peacock & nicholson 1991 ) .",
    "let us assume that we know the shape of the selection function but not its normalization . to reflect this , we write ( ) = _ 0 ( ) , where @xmath39 is our guess as to the shape and @xmath40 is an unknown normalization constant . if we had used @xmath39 in place of the correct @xmath8 in , we would in general not obtain the desired result @xmath41 but rather @xmath42 , which would enter as a systematic positive power bias .",
    "it is the need to eliminate this problem that forces us to impose an integral constraint .",
    "let @xmath43 denote our estimate of @xmath40 .",
    "we will choose @xmath43 so that this bias vanishes , , so that the integral constraint ( ) d^3r=0 holds , or explicitly , ( ) d^3r= 1()_j(_j)_0(_j ) .",
    "this is an unbiased estimator of the density normalization , since @xmath44 , the true value . substituting @xmath45 and into , we obtain ( _ i ) & = & 1 + & = & 1 + & = & _ i ( ) d^3 r _",
    "i ( ) d^3 r , where the function @xmath31 is defined by _ i ( ) ( ) . since we will have @xmath46 with a relative accuracy @xmath47 of order @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of galaxies in the survey , we can to a good approximation treat @xmath40 as a known constant from here on and take @xmath50 on the last line of . since @xmath51 , we now have @xmath52 , so we see that we have succeeded in eliminating the above - mentioned power bias .",
    "the price for this is slightly more complicated equations .",
    "let us now derive the expressions for the shot noise correction and normalization given in equations and .",
    "since @xmath46 , we substitute the last expression of into equation ( 3 ) of t95 , treating @xmath53 as a known function , which gives = 1(2)^3|_i()|^2 p(k ) d^3k + d^3 r , comparing this with and , we identify the three - dimensional window function as w()|_i()|^2 and see that the shot noise correction is _ s^2(_i)&= & d^3 r + & = & |e^-i_i-(_i)()|^2 ( ) ^2()d^3r , and expanding the square completes our derivation of . performing an angular integral",
    "of completes the proof of .",
    "the normalization coefficient @xmath54 of is determined by the requirement that the window function integrate to unity , , @xmath55 .",
    "using parseval s theorem , we obtain n(_i ) & = & |_i()|^2 d^3 r + & = & |e^-i_i-(_i)()|^2 ( ) ^2 d^3r , and expanding the square as above completes our derivation of .",
    "let us evaluate the integral constraint correction factor @xmath56 for a couple of simple examples .",
    "we first note that for the special case of , we have @xmath57 .",
    "hence @xmath58 , and reduces to n()=(1-|()()|^2)f(0 ) , which we recognize as the approximation of park ( 1994 ) . for volume - limited surveys ,",
    "the prescriptions given by equations , and all coincide , so we see that this approximation becomes exact for the volume - limited case with these galaxy weighting schemes . for flux - limited surveys , on the other hand ,",
    "these schemes all give a decreasing weight function @xmath25 , since @xmath8 decreases with distance . for the simple gaussian case @xmath59/\\pi^{1/4}r^{1/2}$ ] , gives n ( ) = 1 + e^-(rk)^2 - 2e^-34(rk)^2 , whereas the approximation gives n ( ) = 1 - e^-(rk)^2 .",
    "a taylor expansion shows that for @xmath60 , the latter overestimates @xmath49 by a factor of two , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "pixelized data analysis methods start by reducing the galaxy survey problem to one similar to that occurring in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments : estimating a power spectrum given noisy fluctuation measurements in a number of discrete  pixels \" . after this , the remaining steps are quite analogous to the cmb case , and involve mere linear algebra ( operations such as matrix inversion , diagonalization , ) .",
    "let us define the overdensity in @xmath49  pixels \" @xmath61 by x_i _",
    "i ( ) d^3 r for some set of functions @xmath31 . although the specific choices of @xmath31 are irrelevant for our present discussion , common choices are to either make these functions fairly localized in real space ( in which case the pixelization is a generalized form of counts in cells ) or fairly localized in fourier space ( in which case one refers to the functions @xmath31 as  modes \" and to @xmath62 as expansion coefficients ) .",
    "let us group the pixels @xmath62 into an @xmath49-dimensional vector @xmath63 .",
    "all proposed pixelized methods assume that the mean and the covariance matrix of this pixel vector are & = & , + & = & , where @xmath64 depends in some known way on the power spectrum .",
    "once the problem has been cast in this form , the power spectrum can be estimated using standard machinery , with either a brute force likelihood analysis ( as in white & bunn ) , a karhunen - love eigenmode analysis ( karhunen 1947 , vogeley & szalay 1996 ; tegmark , taylor & heavens 1997 ) or a direct quadratic analysis ( hamilton 1997ab ; tegmark 1997 ) .      for pixelized methods of power spectrum estimation ,",
    "the procedure for dealing with the integral constraint is quite analogous to that for direct fourier methods . however , as we will now show , it is much simpler to implement . for counts in cells , for example ,",
    "one simply removes the mean from all rows and columns of the covariance matrix @xmath64 before proceeding with the analysis . because of this simplicity , one can , at an almost negligible numerical cost , take a more ambitious approach and allow for more than one unknown parameter in the selection function .",
    "for instance , one can impose the constraints that the radial fluctuation average equals zero for a few hundred different angular bins , thereby eliminating the sensitivity to galactic extinction variations on this scale , as well as requiring that the angular fluctuation average vanish for a number of radial bins to be insensitive to errors in estimating the precise shape of @xmath8 .",
    "let us parametrize the true selection function @xmath8 as ( ) = _ j=1^m _ j_j ( ) , where @xmath65 are known functions and the `` nuissance parameters '' @xmath66 , which we group into an @xmath67-dimensional vector @xmath68 , are _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "let @xmath39 denote some _ a priori _ estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "defining the  uncorrected \" pixels as x_i _ i ( ) d^3 r , we find that = , where the @xmath69-dimensional matrix @xmath70 is defined by _ ij_i ( ) d^3 r. this means that in general , @xmath71 , so the uncorrected data set does not satisfy .",
    "instead , its statistical properties depend on the unknown nuissance parameters @xmath68 .",
    "however , we can easily construct a new  corrected \" data set whose mean is independent of @xmath68",
    ". let us define ",
    ", where -^t , and @xmath72 is a matrix whose rows form an orthonormal basis ( @xmath73 ) for the space spanned by the rows of @xmath70 .",
    "is readily constructed by orthonormalizing the rows of @xmath70 with a gram - schmidt or cholesky procedure ( as in tegmark & bunn 1995 ) . ]",
    "@xmath74 is a symmetric ( @xmath75 ) projection matrix ( @xmath76 ) projecting onto the subspace orthogonal to the columns of @xmath70 , , @xmath77 . our corrected data set @xmath78 satisfies , since @xmath79 .",
    "letting @xmath80 denote the covariance matrix of the uncorrected data set , the corrected data will have the covariance matrix = . once @xmath78 and @xmath64 have been computed , the rest of the pixelized analysis proceeds just as if there had been no integral constraints .",
    "the only complication is that @xmath64 is now singular , having rank @xmath81 instead of @xmath49 .",
    "as shown in the appendix of t97 , the correct way to deal with this is to replace all occurrences of @xmath82 ( which is of course undefined ) by the  pseudo - inverse \" of @xmath64 , defined as ^-1for some constant @xmath83 .",
    "the result is independent of @xmath27 , but a good choice for numerical stability is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the order of magnitude of a typical matrix element of @xmath64 .",
