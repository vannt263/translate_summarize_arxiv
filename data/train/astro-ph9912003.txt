    "ngc6946 is a face - on sc spiral galaxy at a distance of 5.1  mpc @xcite .",
    "twenty - seven supernova remnant ( snr ) candidates have been reported in this galaxy by @xcite , using h@xmath1  and [ sii ]  images . because of the large distance to ngc6946 and limited sensitivity of x - ray and radio detectors , it is difficult to confirm these snr candidates . the most luminous snr candidate in ngc6946 , listed as mf16 in @xcite , is the only one of the 27 candidates confirmed with radio and x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "mf16 , at , ( j2000 ) , was the first known snr in ngc6946 because of its extremely high luminosities in both the x - ray and optical bands @xcite .",
    "it is the brightest known snr in x - rays , @xmath01000 times as luminous as the young galactic remnant cas a and @xmath03.5 times as luminous as the young , ultraluminous snr in ngc4449 @xcite .",
    "its optical brightness is roughly the same as that of the ngc4449 snr and over 10 times greater than that of n49 @xcite , the brightest snr in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "such high luminosities are usually associated with young remnants , as is high velocity gas . yet , gas with has not been detected from mf16 . _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images of this remnant show multiple loops .",
    "this has led @xcite to suggest that mf16 actually consists of colliding snrs of different ages .",
    "intrigued by the extremely high luminosity and interesting morphology , we have obtained a high - dispersion echelle spectrum of mf16 to investigate its physical nature and the cause of its very high luminosity .",
    "the echelle spectrum clearly resolves the emission lines into a broad component and a narrow component , which presumably correspond to the shocked and un - shocked material , respectively . from the velocity profile of the h@xmath1  line and the _ hst _ f656n image ,",
    "we are able to derive the mass and kinetic energy of the snr .",
    "the echelle spectrum has also detected multiple nebular lines , allowing us to examine the diagnostic line ratios .",
    "we find that the [ nii]@xmath36584 to h@xmath1  line ratio is anomalously high for both the narrow and broad components .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath1   ratio of the narrow line component is much higher than those of hii  regions in ngc6946 at similar galactrocentric distances .",
    "a high [ nii]/h@xmath1  ratio is frequently seen in nebulae around wolf - rayet stars and luminous blue variables ; for all such nebulae with good temperature measurements , an enhanced nitrogen abundance is found ( e.g. , esteban et al .",
    "1992 ; smith et al .",
    "the high [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath1  ratio in the narrow component of the snr mf16 is thus a significant discovery . to determine how unusual this high [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath1",
    "ratio is , we have compared mf16 to other snr candidates in ngc6946 .",
    "we have also examined echelle spectra of eight snrs in m33 , and compared the [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath1  ratios for both the narrow and broad components .",
    "we have further explored the nature of mf16 by examining its x - ray spectra and comparing it to several snrs in the lmc .    in this paper",

    "the data we used to study the snr mf16 in ngc6946 included available archived _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations , high - dispersion echelle spectra , and archived _ rosat _ observations . for comparison ,",
    "optical echelle spectra of a control group of eight snrs in m33 and archived _ rosat _ observations of three snrs in the lmc were also examined .",
    "all of the data were reduced using standard routines in iraf and the stsdas and pros packages .",
    "_ hst _ wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) observations of mf16 ( pi : blair ) took place on 1996 january 27 ( ut ) .",

    "a 2@xmath4400  s observation was made with the f439w filter ( blue continuum ) again using cr - split .",
    "a 700  s observation was made with the f555w filter ( visual continuum ) ; cr - split was not used for this observation , making rigorous cosmic - ray removal difficult .",

    "a flat mirror , replacing the cross disperser , and a broad h@xmath1  post - slit filter were used to isolate a single order around the h@xmath1  line .",

    ", we have determined that for the point source  emission from mf16 , so the brightness of the point source can not be accurately measured and visual magnitude can not be derived . ] .",
    "the point source has a fwhm of @xmath02  pixels , and therefore it could be up to @xmath02.5  pc across .",
    "this size is too small for the point source to be an open cluster or ob association @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the point source is consistent with a single class ia supergiant or a multiple star system with fainter individual stars @xcite .",
    "we have also explored the stellar and interstellar environments surrounding mf16 .",
    "the remnant is in a rather unpopulated region of ngc6946 , many hundreds of parsecs north of a spiral arm .",
    "the f656n image shows that mf16 is not associated with any obvious hii  region ( see figure  [ fighst]a ) . a few faint point sources roughly 1  west of mf16 are visible in the wfpc2 f555w and f439w images ( see figure  [ fighst]b ) . to determine whether these point sources constitute an ob association we have made photometric measurements .",
    "these measurements have high uncertainties because the sources are faint ; the typical uncertainty is 0.5 mag in m@xmath8 and 0.2 mag in m@xmath9 . if the extinction is negligible , the spectral types and luminosity classes of these stars range between b  early - a main - sequence stars and f  g class ii bright giants @xcite . these spectral types",
    "are too late for this group of stars to be an ob association . on the other hand , due to the large uncertainities in the magnitude measurements , and",
    "hence colors , these stars could be brighter , have earlier spectral types , and may belong to an ob association .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of an associated hii  region indicates that either these stars have no ionizing power or there is no gas in the surrounding region ; the extinction is therefore unknown . in either case , the association must be old , at least @xmath010@xmath10  yr old .",
    "the closest large structure to mf16 is an hii  region centered @xmath0200  pc to the northwest of the remnant at , ( j2000 ) .",
    "the location of the hii  region is indicated on the f656n image ( see figure  [ fighst]a ) .",
    "the f439w image also shows a stellar concentration in this same location ( see figure  [ fighst]b ) .",
    "the morphology and spatial distribution of this hii  region / stellar concentration are qualitatively similar to some hii  regions / ob associations in the lmc @xcite .",
    "the stellar concentration is likely an ob association roughly 75  pc across .",
    "this size is similar to the average ob association sizes for the lmc , @xmath070  pc @xcite , and m31 , @xmath090  pc @xcite . @xcite",
    "have raised the possibility that mf16 is associated with this stellar concentration . to include the stellar concentration and the stellar sources in and around mf16 , the ob association would be @xmath0250  pc across , far larger than the normal range indicated by lmc and m31 ob associations @xcite .",
    "the ob association would also be required to extend over a region of space @xmath0120  pc across that does not appear to contain a strong concentration of bright stars in the wfpc2 f439w image .",
    "this requirement is not compatible with the results of either older `` by eye '' ob association searches , such as @xcite , or recent automated ob association searches using the path linkage criterion or the `` friends of friends '' algorithm @xcite .",
    "mf16 is therefore unlikely to be associated with the stellar concentration .",

    "we have taken the expansion velocity of the remnant to be the half - width at zero intensity of the h@xmath1  broad component and obtained .",
    "the majority of the h@xmath1 , [ nii]@xmath36584 , and [ oiii]@xmath35007 emission from mf16 comes from the broad component of the lines . in h@xmath1 , the broad component is @xmath01.5 times as strong as the narrow component . in [ nii]@xmath36584 ,",

    "the ambiguity in the model fit was attributed to the low spectral resolution and the very soft energy band of the pspc .",
    "we note that the pspc spectrum of mf16 has a high - energy tail above 2  kev , as shown in figure  [ figxray ] .",
    "this high - energy emission has been confirmed by an asca observation , which shows a complex spectrum that requires multiple emission components @xcite .",
    "we have examined the echelle spectra of the m33 snrs by the same methods used for the echelle spectra of mf16 .",

    "if mf16 is not highly energetic or very young , then we must find another explanation to generate the luminosity of the remnant . a possible mechanism for the luminosity could be the interaction of the expanding snr shell with dense material around the snr .",
    "the young , ultraluminous snr in ngc4449 , which has optical luminosity comparable to the snr mf16 @xcite , is luminous because it is expanding into a nearby hii  region @xcite .",

    "at present , it is premature to determine the real fraction of thermal plasma emission in the x - ray spectrum of mf16 .      much can be learned from the [ nii]@xmath36584/h@xmath1  ratios of the broad and narrow line components of an snr s optical spectrum by comparing them to those of nearby hii  regions .",

    "this colliding snr hypothesis is based on the multiple - loop morphology seen in the f656n wfpc2 image ( see figure  [ fighstha ] ) .",

    "the multiple - loop morphology of mf16 is also consistent with a single snr hypothesis . during the evolution of a massive star , the main - sequence winds , stellar ejecta , supergiant winds , and/or wolf - rayet winds shape multiple shells of ambient material around the evolving star @xcite .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in the nebula ngc6888 , which contains a wn star surrounded by a nitrogen - enriched circumstellar bubble of of size 12@xmath46 pc and an interstellar bubble of diameter 28 pc @xcite .",
    "as a massive star inside such a nebula explodes as a supernova , the resultant snr will have a multiple - loop morphology .",
    "we therefore suggest that a single snr hypothesis is favored over a colliding snr hypothesis for mf16 .",
    "we conclude that the ultraluminous snr mf16 in ngc6946 is a normal snr expanding into a complex ring nebula formed by a massive progenitor , specifically a wn star or lbv .",
    "such a nebula is expected to contain a fragmented circumstellar bubble of stellar ejecta surrounded by a larger interstellar bubble of ambient material swept up by stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the optical luminosity of the remnant is caused by the interaction of the snr shell with these dense shells of material in the nebula .",
    "the multiple - loop morphology seen in the f656n wfpc2 image is a result of this interaction .",
    "since the supernova exploded into the cavity of this nebula , the snr shell would have expanded rapidly through the fragmented circumstellar bubble until it encountered the outer interstellar bubble .",
    "the remnant is therefore still young , @xmath2010@xmath21 yr , and the interior of the snr contains dense clumps of stellar ejecta being ablated by the snr shock and evaporated by the hot medium of the snr interior .",
    "we further suggest that because the progenitor was either a wn star or an lbv , its circumstellar material is nitrogen - rich , leading to the strong [ nii]/h@xmath1  ratio .",
    "similar high luminosity is expected when the ejecta of sn1987a hits the circumstellar rings , which have strong [ nii]/h@xmath1  ratios @xcite .",
    "future observations with a spectroscopic instrument able to resolve the nebula , such as the space telescope imaging spectrograph , would allow the spectral properties of individual sections of the snr mf16 to be probed , resolving many of the outstanding questions of this most interesting supernova remnant .",
