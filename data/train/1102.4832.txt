    "the physical processes operating within the chromospheres of cool stars are very complex and are still far from being fully understood .",
    "the dissipation of chromospheric energy can be probed by the related radiative cooling via chromospheric line emission , most importantly the mg  ii and ca  ii lines , see linsky & ayres ( 1978 ) . as discussed in more detail by judge ( 1990 ) , radiative",
    "cooling is not much affected by the optical thickness of the lines .",
    "the photons leave from a low - density giant chromosphere after multiple line - scattering ( `` effectively thin '' ) .",
    "empirically , the chromospheric line emission shows a minimal , i.e. , `` basal '' flux level , that depends on the effective temperature ( strassmeier et al .",
    "1994 ; schrijver 1987 ; rutten et al .",
    "1991 ) , above which there is a wide distribution of line emissions for the different stars ( vilhu & walter 1987 ) , which also may vary with time .",
    "it has been suggested to associate the basal flux with the dissipation of purely mechanical ( i.e. , acoustic wave ) energy in the turbulent chromosphere ( e.g. , buchholz , ulmschneider & cuntz 1998 ) , while energy released by magnetic activity phenomena is expected to produce the wide variation of emission beyond the basal flux . albeit this is a simple picture",
    ", there is still a number of open questions remaining .",
    "nevertheless , this view appears to be at least consistent with existing empirical evidence for chromospheric energy dissipation ( e.g. , ulmschneider 1991 ; cuntz , ulmschneider & musielak 1998 ; cuntz et al .",
    "1999 ; theurer , ulmschneider & kalkofen 1997 ; fawzy et al .",
    "2002 ; see also review by musielak 2004 ) . specifically , a similar dependence on the effective temperature is obtained ( @xmath3 ; see musielak & rosner 1988 and buchholz et al .",
    "1998 , particularly their fig .",
    "15 ) for both the initial acoustic wave energy flux and the radiative emission flux observed as basal emission .",
    "furthermore , acoustic wave dissipation is mostly independent of gravity ( see ulmschneider 1988 , 1989 and cuntz , rammacher & ulmschneider 1994 ) , providing a further empirical prediction that can be tested by observation .    while earlier studies ( e.g. , strassmeier et al .",
    "1994 ) have already established that the basal flux emission declines towards cooler stars with a large power of @xmath0 , this type of work was mostly based on main - sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "in contrast , our focus is on the basal flux emission of low - gravity stars ; i.e. , stars with about two ( giants lc  iii ) to over four orders of magnitude ( supergiants lc  i ) lower surface gravity than the sun .",
    "hence , we not only aim at refining the dependence of the basal flux on @xmath0 , but also at contesting any possible dependence of the basal flux on gravity .",
    "giant stars also present an interesting case , noting that only a small fraction of their chromospheric mechanical flux would be needed to satisfy the input requirements of their non - dust - driven ( `` reimers - type '' ) cool winds , assuming that a mechanism with a sufficiently large dissipation length operates ( e.g. , holzer & macgregor 1985 ; cuntz 1990 ; sutmann & cuntz 1995 ) .",
    "schrder & cuntz ( 2005 ) have shown , based on a simple analysis of the energy requirements of the winds , that such a mechanism would be well consistent with the reimers formula ( reimers 1977 ) .",
    "the resulting , improved mass loss relation was then successfully tested by schrder & cuntz ( 2007 ) . an updated concept of structured red giant chromospheres and winds initiated by magnetized hot bubbles and",
    "the action of alfvn waves , including long - range action by mode - coupling , has been given by suzuki ( 2007 ) .",
    "his models are also consistent with the existence of a small hot gas component apparently buried under a large column of chromospheric material ( ayres , brown & harper 2003 ) .    to revisit the empirical evidence , we measure the chromospheric emission line fluxes of 177 giant and supergiant stars ( sect .",
    "2 ) . thereafter ,",
    "we determine the basal emission flux for this sample , including its dependence on @xmath0 ( sect .",
    "3 ) , by a detailed statistical analysis .",
    "we also take a look at how well the observed variability of 19 stars over periods of up to two decades is consistent with the basal flux concept .",
    "as we find no evidence for a significant dependency on gravity , we derive an upper limit to any residual change of basal flux over a gravity range of 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "associated aspects of stellar evolution are elucidated in sect .",
    "4 . finally , we compare our results with previous empirical and theoretical findings ( sect . 5 ) and present our discussion and conclusions ( sect . 6 ) .    c    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     for later depiction , we also calculated the interval estimates associated with the position of each basal flux line given by the sample ( see greyish area ) ; see , e.g. , montgomery , peck & vining ( 2006 ) for a brief description of the involved algebra .",
    "we considered both the systematic uncertainty of the data and the statistical uncertainty with respect to the two previously determined basal flux lines .",
    "we assumed a confidence interval ( ci ) of 95% , corresponding to 2.101 standard deviations .",
    "the systematic and the statistical uncertainties have been combined in a linear manner .",
    "the size of the uncertainties obtained for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see table 2 ) are mostly due to the relative small number of objects considered for our analysis .",
    "fortunately , however , they do not result in an overly large interval estimate for the position of either basal flux line .    a further result obtained by utilizing the procedure by press et al .",
    "( 1986 ) consists in the computation of the spearman rank - order coefficient @xmath6 ( see table 2 ) for the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an outcome of @xmath9 would indicate a perfect anti - correlation , whereas an outcome of @xmath10 would indicate a perfect ( positive ) correlation .",
    "for the basal flux line obtained by employing the @xmath2 method , we obtain a @xmath6 value of 0.99995 , whereas for the basal flux line obtained by employing the @xmath11 method a @xmath6 value of 0.99989 is found .",
    "thus , in conclusion , there is an almost perfect ( positive ) correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 for both lines , as expected .",
    "based on the above analysis , while noting that we prefer the @xmath2 based relation ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , the empirical basal flux of the full sample can be represented by a straight line given as @xmath12 that is depicted in both fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 . it is also depicted when comparing our results with previous empirical results as well as results from detailed model computations ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    here , the statistical uncertainty of the empirical slope of the basal flux line in the @xmath8  @xmath13 diagram , given as 7.33 , is 0.47 .",
    "the systematic errors are of similar order . when using the @xmath11 relations instead , the slope is 6.78 , and if furthermore the barnes - evans relation is used for deriving the surface fluxes , with @xmath14 and @xmath0 taken from the @xmath2 relations above , the slope is 7.62 .",
    "hence , these alternative values fall on either side of the purely @xmath2 based result above .",
    "c    c      our sample consists of 16 giants and supergiants for which multiple observations exist ( marked by an asterisk in table 1 ) and to which the relations concerning the derivation of the mg  ii fluxes ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) are applicable . in most cases ,",
    "these observations span over at least several years , in some cases nearly the whole two decades of the iue life time , a timescale comparable to the expected duration of long stellar activity cycles ( e.g. , baliunas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "hence , in view of all sporadic variations of stellar activity on timescales of months , as well as their systematic variations over the full activity cycle , the range of this variability should clearly lie above the basal flux limit .",
    "however , it should be noted that the large - scale of giant granular structure is also expected to yield a certain level of flux variation , expected to be statistical in nature , even in the case of pure acoustic wave heating ( e.g. , judge & cuntz 1993 ) .",
    "figure 3 indicates that this is indeed the case concerning the 16 stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that , despite looking at 16 different objects over a relatively long period of time , _ none _ of them showed a minimum mg  ii emission line flux dipping _ below _ the limit given by the basal chromospheric flux .",
    "note that this assessment is valid for both basal flux limits obtained by employing either the @xmath2 or @xmath11 relationship ; see sect .",
    "about the same temperature dependence as given above has been found in earlier studies ( oranje & zwaan 1985 ; schrijver 1987 ; rutten et al .",
    "1991 ) , which were however mostly aimed at ms stars .",
    "for example , rutten et al .",
    "( 1991 ) derived a dependence on the effective temperature akin to @xmath15 .",
    "a paper focused on the basal flux in g and k - type giants has been given by strassmeier et al .",
    "they measured the ca  ii line emission using ground - based spectroscopy . for the k - line they found a basal flux represented by @xmath16 which has a similar slope as the relationships obtained in our present study , particularly the relation based on @xmath2 color transformation ( see eq .  7 ) .    a more recent result for the emission flux in ca  ii",
    "was given by pasquini , de medeiros & girardi ( 2000 ) .",
    "they obtained ca  ii h+k high resolution observations for 60 evolved stars of spectral type f to k located in five open clusters .",
    "pasquini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the ca  ii k fluxes scaled , in essence , linearly with the stellar rotational velocity , whereas the basal flux line scaled with respect to the stellar effective temperature according to @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the slopes of the basal mg  ii flux emission ( based on @xmath2 and @xmath11 colors ) as well as the slope of the previously derived basal ca  ii flux emission fully agree with respect to each other within their respective uncertainties , if available . in absolute terms , the mg  ii basal flux derived in the present study lies about 0.6 dex higher , while the expected off - set should be only about 0.3 dex due to the intrinsically smaller emission measure of the ca  ii k lines compared to the mg  ii lines , as well as other differences in the ca  ii and mg  ii line formation processes ( for a detailed study see , e.g. , linsky & ayres 1978 and ayres 1979 ) .",
    "the remaining difference of a 0.3 dex higher basal flux deduced in the present study is attributable to the fact that the earlier work did not fully consider underlying uncertainties .",
    "the omission of uncertainties readily results in an artificially broadened flux distribution towards smaller values . if we choose not to average over various borderline cases ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) but simply set the basal flux line to consistently undercut _ all _ lowest flux values , our findings would essentially be in perfect agreement with the historical values .",
    "links to theoretical studies of angular momentum evolution have been explored by gray ( 1991 ) , schrijver ( 1993 ) , schrijver & pols ( 1993 ) , charbonneau , schrijver & macgregor ( 1997 ) , and others .",
    "these studies show that when solar - type stars evolve away from the main - sequence , their rotation slows down beyond what must be expected from the increase in the moment of inertia caused by changes in the internal mass distribution . hence , their angular momentum subsides , due to magnetic braking resulting from the onset of massive stellar winds .",
    "thus , one would rather expect little magnetic activity in evolved stars .",
    "but as demonstrated by fig .  2 ,",
    "this is mostly true only for m and late k giants ( i.e. , with @xmath18 ) .",
    "by contrast , flux measurements for many g giants and g supergiants are spread over several orders of magnitude above their basal fluxes .",
    "a look at the evolutionary history of the respective giants shows that the latter group should indeed be expected to exhibit strong magnetic activity , whereas the former should not .",
    "the same picture has been found empirically from the strength of coronal x - ray emission , and was explained based on the same reasoning ( schrder , hnsch & schmitt 1998 ) : g giants are usually first - time hertzsprung - gap crossers of about 1.5 to 2 @xmath19 , whereas g supergiants are relatively massive ( 4 to 10 @xmath19 ) stars in their central he - burning phase .",
    "all these giants once were , as ms stars , too hot ( i.e. , spectral type earlier than f0 ) to possess convective outer layers ; those only developed later .",
    "hence , g giants and supergiants were unable to host a solar - like magnetic dynamo until only very recently in their evolutionary history , and their present magnetic activity has not suffered much from magnetic breaking .    by contrast , k and m giants have mostly evolved from less massive ms stars , as k giant clump stars and as rgb / agb stars .",
    "their progenitors have been active during their entire ms life times and suffered from magnetic breaking all along .",
    "hence , for these stars , like in regards to their coronal x - ray emission , we find a reduced ( but still not vanished ) level of magnetic activity .",
    "it has therefore been argued ( e.g. , dupree et al . 1990 ; buchholz et al .",
    "1998 ) that the dominant chromospheric heating mechanism in single inactive late - type ( super- ) giants might be essentially acoustic rather than magnetic in nature . early results in support of this picture based on the analysis of the evolution of rotation rates and chromospheric activity of giants have been given by rutten & pylyser ( 1988 ) .",
    "figure 4 offers a detailed comparison of our results for the chromospheric basal flux line with results from previous theoretical and empirical studies as given by schrijver ( 1987 ) , rutten et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , judge & stencel ( 1991 ) , cuntz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and buchholz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . even though the sample of stars presented here is much larger and",
    "has a different composition compared to some of the earlier studies , we find that our results are in good agreement , especially with the theoretical results obtained by buchholz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . with respect to the different approaches in the derivation of the chromospheric basal flux line and the associated systematic errors ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) , no discernible differences were found .",
    "the systematic errors are commensurate to the uncertainties of the individual data .    as shown in fig .  4 , our observational results , i.e. , the empirical basal flux limits for the adopted sample including the biparabolic envelopes for the associated statistical uncertainties , show considerable agreement with the previous results by schrijver ( 1987 ) and rutten et al .",
    "agreement is found for the relatively hot segment of the sample ( @xmath20  k ) with the previous results by schrijver ( 1987 ) and rutten et al .",
    "( 1991 ) as well as for the relatively cool segment of the sample ( @xmath21  k ) with the result by judge & stencel ( 1991 ) ; note that none of these authors communicate any uncertainty bars for their results .",
    "judge & stencel provided an empirical analysis for the global thermodynamic properties of the outer atmospheres of giant stars and a small number of supergiants by addressing both the mass - loss energetics and the outer atmospheric heating in the framework of previously proposed concepts .",
    "previous work by linsky & ayres ( 1978 ) , schrijver ( 1987 ) and rutten et al .",
    "( 1991 ) revealed the surprising property that the ca  ii and mg  ii basal flux lines for ms stars and giants essentially coincide .",
    "this result is , in principle , also consistent with the findings from the more recent study by cardini ( 2005 ) based on 225 stars of luminosity class i to v , even though it is providing some indications that the mg  ii _ k _ flux increases slowly ( i.e. , by a factor of 2 ) with decreasing stellar gravity , especially if supergiants are included . on the other hand , it is highly noteworthy that the targeted gravity range encompasses more than four orders of magnitude and , furthermore , a factor of 2 is well within one standard deviation of the position of the mg  ii basal flux line obtained by the present study ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the lack of a pronounced difference in the mg  ii ( and ca  ii ) basal flux limits is mainly caused by the enormous differences in the geometrical extent of the stellar radiative zones for the different types of stars , especially with respect to the h@xmath22 continuum ( ulmschneider 1988 , 1989 ; cuntz et al .",
    "1994 ; buchholz et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the framework of acoustic models , the wave energy flux at photospheric levels",
    "is significantly increased in giant stars compared to ms stars , but so is the extent and efficiency of the h@xmath22 radiative damping zones ( ulmschneider 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "however , both features largely off - set each other , leading to a very similar amount of available wave energy in the ca  ii and mg  ii line formation region in ms and giant stars .",
    "consequently , for the special case of magnetically inactive stars , this behaviour can readily explain a relatively similar basal flux emission for both types of objects , consistent with observations .",
    "cuntz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) expanded this type of analysis to evolved stars of different metallicities which led to the same type of outcome , thus providing consistency with previous observational results by dupree et al .",
    "with an unprecedented sample size and time coverage , our study confirms the concept of a basal chromospheric emission flux from a purely empirical point of view . we confirm a strong dependence of the flux on @xmath0 , while a dependence on gravity ( shift of the basal flux regarding samples of stars of different luminosity classes ) must be smaller than the involved statistical errors .",
    "in addition , all well documented cases of time - variable chromospheric flux emission ( see sect .",
    "3.2 , fig .",
    "3 ) remain well above the basal flux limit .",
    "we view this as further empirical evidence for a _ physically different _ origin of the basal flux , which is obviously unrelated to the highly time - variable heating processes associated with stellar magnetic activity .",
    "we acknowledge that there is still an ongoing debate about the physical origin of the basal flux .",
    "previously , judge & cuntz ( 1993 ) confronted the predictions of 1-d acoustic heating models for @xmath23 tauri ( k5  iii ) with hst - ghrs observations .",
    "they arrived at a list of problems associated with the disagreements between the theoretical acoustic models and the observation .",
    "judge & cuntz ( 1993 ) concluded that @xmath23 tauri s chromosphere might either ( partially ) be magnetically heated or @xmath23 tauri has acoustic properties substantially different from those of traditional mixing - length models or its chromosphere is determined by 3-d turbulence and/or horizontal flows .",
    "however , so far , no detailed 3-d acoustic chromospheric heating models have been given for giant or supergiant stars , which would allow contesting the empirically deduced basal flux limits , although significant progress on the calculation of 3-d non - magnetic chromosphere models has meanwhile been made for the sun ( e.g. , wedemeyer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we therefore suggest , also considering our discussion of sect .",
    "5 , that the processes for the heating and emission of chromospheric basal flux stars are largely attributable to the dissipation of mechanical energy .",
    "this form of energy is inherent in any star and shows little variability with time ( except on stellar evolutionary time - scales ) . as its physical manifestation , acoustic waves and turbulent motions have been suggested as a candidate mechanism long time ago ( e.g. , narain & ulmschneider 1990 ) . in combination",
    "they might also explain or contribute ( in an appropriate 3-d implementation ) to the spectroscopically derived near - sonic ( or apparently even supersonic ) turbulent velocities revealed by chromospheric line profiles .",
    "the dissipation of a form of non - magnetic , supposedly acoustic wave energy deposited in the turbulent chromosphere , agrees with the refined empirical relationship , which we obtained for the basal flux including its dependence on the stellar effective temperature .",
    "different approaches to derive the surface fluxes and the values for the effective temperatures yielded no significant differences ( i.e. , no more that 1@xmath24 of the involved statistical parameters ) .    in that sense",
    ", we can also confirm that our results agree with previously attained hydrodynamic chromosphere models , also noting that the mechanical energy deposited in the mg  ii line formation regions vary very little with gravity .",
    "in fact , within the uncertainties , our relation renders the same basal flux even over four orders of magnitude as has been attained for ms stars .",
    "still , a small contribution to the basal flux from heating processes related to some permanent , weak magnetic carpet can not entirely be ruled out since the empirical basal flux appears to be slightly higher ( by about its inherent uncertainty ) than the fluxes suggested by previous acoustic heating models . in fact , it has been argued that magnetic fields might also contribute to balancing the basal emission flux ( judge & carpenter 1998 ) , although more detailed studies are still needed to further investigate this claim .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the upward propagating mechanical flux and energy required for driving a cool wind emerging from the outer chromosphere is about an order of magnitude smaller than the total mechanical turn - over of the turbulent chromosphere in the above mentioned models .",
    "hence , it may be possible for a turbulent giant chromosphere to divert such a small fraction of its mechanical flux to drive a cool star wind .",
    "it is intriguing that both the basal flux and a matching wind energy input show about the same dependency on @xmath0 ( by a power of 7.5 , as assumed by schrder & cuntz 2005 ) , and neither seems to depend considerably on gravity .",
    "an extended giant chromosphere definitely assists a cool star wind in another aspect : mass loss emerging from the outer chromosphere requires a lot less energy input compared to a wind originating directly from the stellar photosphere due to the reduction in the required amount of potential energy .",
    "these two arguments strongly support the idea that the mechanical energy reservoir of the chromosphere , as probed by the basal flux , also nurtures the wind energy input , possibly associated with weak magnetic fields .",
    "updated models based on structured red giant winds have meanwhile been presented by suzuki ( 2007 ) .",
    "he attributes the occurrence of mass loss to the action of alfvn waves , excited by surface convection , which travel outward while dissipating via non - linear processes to accelerate and heat the stellar winds ; see , e.g. , hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) , hartmann & avrett ( 1984 ) and airapetian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for previous models of mass loss concerning low - gravity stars invoking alfvn waves . in case of hybrid stars , suzuki ( 2007 )",
    "advocates the existence of hot bubbles , which are the source of the observed uv / soft x - ray emission .",
    "clearly , in the framework of cool giant chromospheres and winds , it appears that there might be an intricate interplay of different processes operating on different scales which are responsible for producing the observed phenomena and features .",
    "this work has been supported by the mexican science foundation conacyt under their postgrad - student grant program and by conacyt grant no .",
    "80804 ( cb-2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , we are very grateful for the on - line availability of the iue final data archive at stsci , without which this study would not have been possible ."
