    "it is well known  @xcite that the dynamics of point vortices in a plane ( vortex lines ) in an ideal incompressible fluid can be described by the ( hamiltonian ) system of first - order equations @xmath2 where @xmath3 are coordinates of vortices in the complex form , and @xmath4 are their intensities .",
    "the velocity of fluid  @xmath5 at a given point of the plane is determined by the expression @xmath6 so that the velocity near a fixed vortex @xmath7 can be represented in the form of the series @xmath8    thus , the dynamics of point vortices is the dynamics of singularities in the field of an ideal incompressible fluid of a special kind  . in their work",
    "mentioned above , a.a.fridman and p.ya.polubarinova @xcite consider the dynamics of singularities of a more general form ( these singularities persist during fluid motion ) , in the case when the expansion of velocity near the singularity is determined by the laurent series @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are complex numbers such that all @xmath11 do not vanish simultaneously .    to determine the velocity of the singularity we use the following principle  @xcite :    *",
    "suppose that  @xmath12 is a ring near a singularity with the inner radius  @xmath13 and external radius  @xmath14 ( see  figure  1 ) ; if the fluid bounded by the ring  @xmath12 , solidify in the moment considered ( without redistribution of the surrounding velocity field ) , the obtained buoy will have a translational velocity @xmath15 and the angular velocity @xmath16 .",
    "when the radii @xmath17 tend to zero , we obtain the respective _ velocities of the singularity_.    using   and taking into account the conservation laws of momentum and angular momentum , we obtain the following : @xmath18 and passage to the limit yields @xmath19    thus , the translational velocity of the singularity ( in the complex form ) is equal to the absolute term in the expansion of flow velocity into laurent series , and the angular velocity does not vanish only if @xmath20 , which corresponds to an ordinary point vortex in a fluid with @xmath21 .    * remark 1 . * _ the above reasoning shows that additional physical considerations ( such as the existence of minimum admissible sizes within which the flow has no singularities and the like ) , should be involved in the construction of dynamic models of higher - order singularities ( dipoles , quadrupoles , and the like ) and the evaluation of their angular velocity . _    the simplest singularities ( which also are isotropic , that is , their angular velocity has no effect on their translational velocity ) are the following first - order singularities ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) :    * vortex @xmath23 ; * sources @xmath24 ; * vortex source @xmath25 .",
    "the equation of vortex motion can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the intensities of the source and the vortex , respectively .",
    "a particular case of the system   is the system of equations for motion of vortices  @xcite and sources  @xcite , which , as was found , can be represented in hamiltonian form .",
    "at arbitrary complex intensities @xmath29 , equations   are invariant with respect to the group of motions of the plane @xmath30 .",
    "the invariance with respect to translations results in the existence of two linear integrals , which in a complex form can be written as @xmath31    in the case of ordinary vortices and sources , we have the well - known integrals for the vorticity center and the center of divergence : @xmath32 in the general case , @xmath33 in determines _ the center of intensities_. clearly , if @xmath34 , we can choose the origin of the coordinates such that @xmath35 .    unlike the vortex dynamics , the rotational symmetry , which corresponds to a field of symmetries of the type of @xmath36 , does not result , in the general case , in the existence of an additional integral . in this case , we have only a differential relation @xmath37 in the case of vortices  , this relationship allows us to obtain the well - known integral of momentum @xmath38 and in the case of sources , we obtain @xmath39 thus , in the case of sources , we have the non - autonomous integral @xmath40 it is clear that , when @xmath41 , in the case of sources , we obtain an ordinary autonomous integral . in the general case of vortex sources ,   fails to yield even a non - autonomous integral .    it can be easily shown that the divergence of the right - hand part of equations   is equal to zero ; therefore , we have    * proposition 1 * _ the equations of motion of vortex sources conserve the standard ( i.e. , constant - density ) invariant measure . _    in addition to the above - mentioned integrals and relations , equations in particular cases of vortices and sources yield one more integral @xmath42 and also can be written in the hamiltonian form : @xmath43    this representation is well known for vortices ; the hamiltonian and the poisson bracket are : @xmath44    analogous representation for sources was suggested in  @xcite : @xmath45 the integral was obtained in @xcite . as is the case with vortices , the integrals of motion and   are non - involutive , and satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath46    equations   and , by virtue of the liouville theorem , imply the following conclusion .",
    "* proposition 2 * _ if in the problem of motion of three sources @xmath47 or  @xmath48 , the system is completely integrable in these cases . _    indeed , if @xmath49 , we have three involutive integrals , for example , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath42 , while if @xmath52 , such integrals are @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath42",
    ".    moreover , for the case of four sources , we obtain    * proposition 3 * _ suppose that in the problem of four sources , we have @xmath55 , then the system is completely integrable on the invariant manifold determined by condition @xmath56 . _    indeed , in this case we have three autonomous independent integrals @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 , which are in involution on this manifold .",
    "note that , for the problem of four vortices to be integrable , it is sufficient to require that @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "* remark 2 * _ in the general case of vortex sources , we can consider the complex function _",
    "@xmath59 which satisfies the following relations  @xcite : @xmath60",
    "this problem is completely integrable by quadratures , and its particular cases are well known .",
    "if @xmath61 , both vortices move along concentric circles around a center of vorticity with coordinates @xmath62 , remaining on a common line with this center , and the angular rotation velocity is    @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the distance between the vortices .    if @xmath65 , the motion of vortices is translational in the direction perpendicular to the straight line connecting them .",
    "and the velocity of vortices is @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 , the sources move along a single straight line fixed in space and approach the center of intensity with coordinates @xmath68 ; and the square of the distance between them varies in accordance with the following formula @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 , the sources move along a fixed line so that the distance between them remains constant and their velocity is @xmath71 .",
    "the equations of motion in this case are @xmath72 suppose that @xmath73 ; without loss of generality , we can assume that the center of intensity lies in the origin of coordinates , that is @xmath74 expressing from here the coordinates of each particle and passing to polar coordinates @xmath75 , @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "solving these equations yields the law of motion : @xmath80 where @xmath81 are constants of integration .",
    "thus , equations are integrable by quadratures .    _ in this case , the trajectories of vortex sources are spirals with an infinite number of turns around the center of intensities_.    if @xmath82 , assuming that @xmath83 , we find that @xmath84 that is , the vortex sources move with a constant velocity along parallel straight lines at an angle of @xmath85 @xmath86 with respect to the segment connecting them .",
    "interestingly , equations also have an integral of the energy type , which is a superposition of integrals and : @xmath87    it is well known that the presence of three integrals in a four - dimensional system ( in this case , these are integrals @xmath88 and  @xmath42 ) implies in that such system can be represented in the hamiltonian form  @xcite .",
    "if we take the function  @xmath42 in   as the hamiltonian , the respective poisson brackets are @xmath89 explicitly , we obtain @xmath90    * remark 3 * _ generally speaking , the system can be represented in the hamiltonian form in three different ways , but the poisson brackets thus obtained are not constant .",
    "_    * remark 4 * _ although the system is hamiltonian , the merging of vortex source ( at @xmath91 ) within finite time is not excluded . _",
    "it is common knowledge that a three - vortex system on a plane is liouville integrable and its phase space in the compact case is foliated into two - dimensional tori filled with quasiperiodic motions . to study that problem methods of qualitative analysis of hamiltonian systems ( geometric interpretation , construction of bifurcation diagrams , and so on ;",
    "see @xcite , where a vast bibliography is presented ) can be used .    in the general case ,",
    "the three - source problem is not liouville integrable by quadratures .",
    "its behavior , however , is regular .",
    "indeed , this problem is determined by a hamiltonian system with the poisson bracket @xmath92 and the hamiltonian @xmath93    as in the general case , the equations of motion of this system are invariant with respect to the @xmath30 group ( group of motions of the plane ) . according to the general theory  @xcite",
    ", we obtain a closed system for the invariants of the symmetry group . in our case",
    "( as in the vortex theory ) , it is convenient to take distances between the sources @xmath94 , @xmath95 as invariants .",
    "we obtain @xmath96    note that such reduction into invariants of the group of symmetries in this case differs from the traditional hamiltonian reduction .",
    "this is due to the fact that system   does not admit autonomous integrals , the hamiltonian vector field of rotations is associated with the nonautonomous integral , which linearly varies with time .    in the hamiltonian form ,",
    "reduction only by one degree of freedom is possible ( based on integrals  ) . in this case , the distances @xmath97 should be complemented by one of the angles @xmath98 ; the hamiltonian of the reduced system and the poisson bracket can be written as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the doubled oriented area of the triangle formed by the sources ; this area can be expressed in terms of the distances by the heron formula : @xmath101 the equation @xmath102 which describes the evolution of  @xmath103 , completely determines the absolute dynamics of the sources ( the remaining angles @xmath104 can be found from the law of cosines ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian reduction in this case is a simple restriction on the level of integrals .",
    "let us consider equations in more detail .",
    "direct calculations readily show that system also has the nonautonomous integral @xmath105 and conserves the invariant measure with the density @xmath106 equations   are homogenous so they also admit the one - parameter symmetry group , @xmath107 , which allows an additional reduction of the order by a change in the variables and the time in the following form ( the so - called projection procedure ) : @xmath108 we have @xmath109    thus , qualitative analysis of the system considered here reduces to the examination of the system on the plane  . as a result ,",
    "the dynamics of the system is regular , although it does not have a complete set of global integrals .      in vortex dynamics , an important role in the qualitative analysis of systems played by stationary configurations , with which stationary points of the reduced system were associated .",
    "_ homothetic configurations _",
    "( this terminology was adopted from celestial mechanics ) , i.e. , configurations that remain self - similar in any time moment , play an analogous role in the dynamics of sources .",
    "this condition can be represented in the following form @xmath110 * remark 5 * _ it can be readily seen that , because of the existence of integral , the system of equations has no fixed points . _",
    "the following simple statement is true :    * proposition 4 * _ the only possible homothetic configurations in a three - source system are _ :    1 .   _ equilateral configuration , in which the sources form an equilateral triangle _ : @xmath111 ; _ the vortices move along fixed straight lines , which cross in the center of intensity , and the equality _",
    "@xmath112 _ is valid ; _ 2 .   _ collinear configurations , such that the vortices lie on the single fixed straight line _",
    "@xmath113 , @xmath114 , _ where _ @xmath115 _ is a root of the cubic equation _ @xmath116 _ such that _",
    "@xmath117    proof .    according to  ,",
    "homothetic configurations are fixed points of the system  .",
    "the cases where @xmath118 or @xmath119 correspond to singularities of the initial system , where one of the distances vanishes ; therefore , they should be left out of consideration .",
    "the remaining fixed points can be found in the following way .",
    "note that equation @xmath120 is linear with respect to @xmath121 ; solving this equation with respect to @xmath121 and substituting @xmath122 , we obtain , after cancellation , the equation that determines a homothetic configuration @xmath123    we find from here one more solution @xmath124 , which , as can be readily seen , corresponds to @xmath125 ; that is , this solution corresponds to an equilateral configuration .",
    "the remaining equation , which is cubic with respect to @xmath126 , with the substitution @xmath127 can be represented in the form @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the polynomial . substituting the obtained solution for @xmath126 in the equation for @xmath121 yields @xmath130",
    ", that is , this solution corresponds to a collinear configuration ( with differently ordered sources ) .    using equation",
    ", we find that in both cases , @xmath131 , ( by virtue of either @xmath132 or @xmath133 ) , that is , the sources move along straight lines fixed in the space . the evolution rates of the squared distances can be immediately found from equations after the substitution of the obtained solutions.@xmath134      it is well known that complete qualitative analysis can be made for both the motion of a reduced system and the absolute motion @xcite .",
    "a convenient tool for study in this case is a projection of the phase flow on the plane of the integral of momentum in the space of mutual distances @xmath135 .",
    "we will show that , in the case of three sources , such projection also exists ; the corresponding plane system admits complete qualitative analysis and gives a complete description of both relative and absolute dynamics of sources .",
    "let us write a nonautonomous integral of the system in the form @xmath136 and define the projection and time transformation by the formulas @xmath137 the equations of motion for the projective variables are @xmath138 clearly , the trajectories of the system   that correspond to the trajectories of the original system lie on the invariant manifold @xmath139 this manifold is the plane in the three - dimensional space @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "however , imply that the heron formula and the conditions @xmath143 , the domain of possible motions lies within one half of the cone determined by the inequality @xmath144    thus , the boundary of the domain of possible motions on the plane , which is determined by inequality , is a second - order curve of one of the three types :    1 .",
    "ellipse ( if @xmath145 ) ; 2 .   hyperbola ( if @xmath146 ) ; 3 .",
    "parabola ( if @xmath147 ) .    a one - to - one mapping exists between the trajectories of the system in the domain considered here and the trajectories of the reduced system of three sources .",
    "thus , we have constructed a projection of the phase flow of a three - source system , which is completely identical to the analogous projection in the vortex dynamics ( up to the change @xmath148 ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider in more detail the structure of the phase portrait in the first case ( see figures  2,3 ) , which , by analogy with vortex dynamics will be referred to as _",
    "`` compact '' _ ; clearly , in this case all ratios @xmath149 remain bounded for all time . the second ( _ `` noncompact '' _ ) case can be studied in a similar manner ; however , the latter , third case ( as well as the case @xmath150 ) requires special consideration because , according to  , an autonomous integral exists in this case .",
    "the structure of the phase flow of the system on the plane   is completely determined by its singularities , fixed points , and separatrices connecting fixed points .",
    "statement 1 makes it possible to show that the system on the plane considered here has either four fixed points , which we denote @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ( figure  2 ) , or two fixed points   @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( figure  3 ) .",
    "point @xmath151 corresponds to an equilateral homothetic configuration and lies within the domain ( ellipse ) ; points @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 lie on the boundary of the domain and determine collinear homothetic configurations ( since it is clear that for these points , @xmath155 ) .",
    "additionally , the system has ( in the domain considered ) three singularities @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , which lie on the boundary in the tangent points of planes @xmath159 ; they correspond to the situation when the pair of sources merges .    as in the vortex dynamics , in the compact case , we distinguish two cases , in which the portraits qualitatively differ :    1 .",
    "all intensities have the same sign ; 2 .",
    "two intensities are positive ( negative ) , while the third intensity is negative ( positive ) , and @xmath160 .    in the case of @xmath161 , as can be seen from figure  2 , collinear configurations are saddle points , and the equilateral configuration is a node point ( at @xmath162 , it is a sink , while at @xmath163 , it is a source ) , such that all the three separatrices of collinear points enter into it .",
    "all the trajectories start ( at @xmath162 ) from singularities @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , do not go beyond the domain limited by the separatrices of collinear points @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and merge in the fixed point @xmath151 .",
    "( at @xmath164 , the direction of motion along these trajectories should be reversed . )    in the case @xmath165 , the only fixed point @xmath152 ( corresponding to the collinear configuration ) is a source ( @xmath162 ) ; the equilateral configuration now corresponds to a saddle point .",
    "three separatrices of the saddle point end in the singularities @xmath156 @xmath157 , @xmath158 , respectively , and the fourth separatrix , ends in the fixed point @xmath152 .",
    "a general phase portrait is given in figure  3 .",
    "of great importance in the dynamics of @xmath166 point vortices are the simplest periodic solutions , i.  e. , stationary configurations such that vortices rotate around a common center of vorticity without changing their mutual arrangement .",
    "analogous solutions were found in the dynamics of @xmath166 point sources , with the only difference that the points move along fixed straight lines passing through the center of divergence of the sources so that their configuration remains self - similar at any time .",
    "such configurations will be referred to as _ homothetic_.    let us show that the following statement is true    * proposition 5 * _ there exists a one - to - one map between the stationary configurations of the dynamics and the homothetic configurations of the dynamics of @xmath166 point sources .",
    "_    proof    indeed , for any stationary configuration in a coordinate system with the origin at the vorticity center , the coordinates of vortices are as follows @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the constant angular velocity of rotation of the configuration , and the constant complex numbers @xmath169 satisfy the system of algebraic equations : @xmath170 where @xmath28 are the intensities of vortices @xmath171 .    in the case of sources",
    "@xmath172 , we similarly find the particular solutions which specify the homothetic configurations in the form @xmath173 where @xmath169 are complex numbers satisfying the system of equations , in which the change of variables @xmath174 must be made.@xmath134    note that the solution of the system of algebraic equations is not known , and the problem of finding the homothetic configurations of sources also can not be solved completely .",
    "a some of particular results for stationary configurations in vortex dynamics are summarized in @xcite .",
    "* remark 6 * _ in celestial mechanics , the homothetic configurations form a particular case of a wider class of homographic configurations , when all points at all times form such configurations , which rotate around a common center of masses .",
    "there seems to be no such configurations , other than homothetic , in the source dynamics .",
    "as far as we know , the question of existence of such configurations in the case of vortex sources has not been considered . _",
    "let us consider a possible generalization of the motion equations of vortex sources ( and other singularities in a fluid flow ) for the case of a sphere . to do this",
    ", we make a stereographic projection of the plane onto the sphere and write the equations of vortex motion on the sphere  @xcite in complex form .    in the case of the stereographic projection from the southern pole onto the plane passing through the northern pole ( see figure  4 ) , the rectangular coordinates of a point on the sphere can be written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the curvature .        the velocity of the fluid determined by the vortices in any point of the sphere is expressed analogous to  : @xmath180 it can be easily shown that the divergence of this velocity field is zero and its vorticity is constant at any point of the sphere @xmath181 and equals @xmath182    by analogy with the planar case , let us replace the intensities @xmath183 by complex numbers @xmath184 ; we obtain the equations describing the motion of singularities .",
    "these singularities can be interpreted as vortex sources on the sphere .",
    "@xmath185    unlike the planar case , the velocity field determined by the singularities ( this field can be calculated by formula with replacement @xmath186 ) , in addition to the vortex sources in points @xmath169 , has a non - zero vorticity   and a divergence equal to @xmath187 at any point of the sphere @xmath188 .    clearly , such corrections in the motion equations of a fluid on a sphere stem from the compactness of the sphere , and if a point source or a vortex appears in some point , at the same time , a point sink or sinks uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere must appear somewhere .",
