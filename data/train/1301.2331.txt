    "x - ray emission of late - type stars arises in hot gas contained by magnetic loops above the stellar surface .",
    "these loops are produced by the interaction of convective motion and differential rotation in the stellar envelope ; hence the magnetic activity of a late - type main - sequence star  and with it the x - ray emission  is found to be higher in rapidly rotating stars ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "as stars age their rotation slows down , and it was a surprise that a _ rosat _ study of the old open cluster m67 discovered a large number of x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "comparison with optical observations provided the explanation : in an old cluster stars may rotate rapidly when tidal forces spin them up towards corotation with the binary revolution @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of old open clusters help in identifying such , otherwise inconspicuous , active binaries ( abs ) in which tidal forces are or have been effective , and contribute to the understanding of tidal interaction . since the typical timescale for tidal interaction rapidly increases with the ratio of the orbital separation to stellar radius @xcite , only stars in binaries with relatively short periods or relatively large radii experience the effects of tidal locking .",
    "x - ray observations of abs in old clusters thus probe the populations of hard binaries , and the relative number of such systems found in clusters with different properties is an important tool for understanding the effects of the cluster environment on the binary content .    thanks to prolonged optical studies , e.g.  in the wiyn open cluster study @xcite , our knowledge of the binary population in clusters is reaching completeness levels which enable a detailed comparison with theoretical models of the evolution of stellar clusters and of the binary population in them .",
    "to explain the large number of blue stragglers observed in m67 ( 4 gyr ) , the model by @xcite requires a large initial number of short - period binaries that act as seeds from which blue stragglers are formed .",
    "as the simulated hard - binary fraction and period distribution do not evolve much , the close binaries remain abundant throughout the life time of the cluster .",
    "@xcite point out that comparison with the observed binaries in the old cluster ngc188 ( 6.5 gyr ; @xcite ) finds no evidence of such a high fraction of close binaries .",
    "the number of clusters studied is still small , as is the number of detailed models , and more study is required before a final verdict on these and other discrepancies ( see @xcite for details ) can be made .",
    "by now , observations of globular clusters with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ have uncovered hundreds of faint ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 ) close binaries , only part of which have been classified so far . as these binaries are an important driver of the long - term evolution of a cluster ,",
    "understanding the properties and frequency of the various binary classes is a major goal of investigating ( globular ) cluster x - ray sources .",
    "sometimes the outcome of a dynamical encounter is a binary or multiple system in a very unusual configuration , and this allows us to study source types that are not , or only rarely , found in the field . besides abs , which are the dominant x - ray source class in old open clusters , globular - cluster x - ray sources include cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , low - mass x - ray binaries in quiescence ( qlmxbs ) , and milli - second pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "the correlation of the numbers of qlmxbs and cvs with the stellar encounter frequency reveals the important role that dynamical encounters play in the creation of such binaries @xcite , but the net balance between formation and destruction is less clear . for a large part",
    "this is due to the lack of a reference point that quantifies their number densities in a dynamically inactive environment .",
    "ideally , the comparison should be made against the galactic field where stellar densities are low , but this is complicated because of the generally limited information on distance and age for stars in the field , and the intrinsic scarcity of sources such as qlmxbs . old open clusters provide an alternative that is worthwhile to explore , but so far only few have been studied in detail in x - rays .",
    "moreover , it should be kept in mind that dynamical encounters can not be completely ignored in open clusters .",
    "observational indications for the occurrence of dynamical interactions have come from individual systems whose properties are difficult to explain by binary evolution as it would take place outside a cluster environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present the results of the first x - ray observation of ngc6791 , which , at an age of about 8 gyr , is one of the oldest known open clusters in our galaxy .",
    "besides the _ chandra _ data , we obtained optical spectra to classify candidate optical counterparts to the detected x - ray sources .",
    "ngc6791 has been studied extensively in the optical .",
    "the rich body of available literature has proven to be very useful for the classification of our _ chandra _ sources , and for separating cluster members from non - members . for the study of interacting binaries it is a promising target : before this work it was known to harbor two of only three spectroscopically - confirmed cvs found in open clusters @xcite , and many optical - variability studies have revealed dozens of close binaries in the field of the ngc6791 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate if the x - ray source content of ngc6791 is as rich and varied as was found for the few old open clusters studied previously , viz .",
    "m67 @xcite and ngc188 @xcite .",

    "we adopt a distance of 4.1 kpc and a constant reddening @xmath6 , which corresponds to a neutral - hydrogen column density @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the reddening could vary across the area of the cluster @xcite but the effect is too small to have a significant impact on our results .",

    "we make a very conservative estimate of the number of cvs and abs . a lower limit",
    "is derived by counting the number of ( candidate ) cvs and abs in table 2 of @xcite , while an upper limit ( given in square brackets in table  [ tab_oc ] ) is estimated by adding all unidentified and unclassified sources to either the cvs or abs and subtracting the estimated contribution from agn .",

    "table  [ tab_oc ] readily shows that the total number of abs above @xmath92 erg s@xmath1 , normalized by cluster mass , is much lower in the two globular clusters than in m67 and ngc6791 . for 47tuc",
    "the difference is a factor of 65230 compared to m67 , whereas ngc6397 likely does not have any abs at all above this luminosity .",
    "lowering the x - ray luminosity cutoff value would increase the numbers of abs especially for ngc6397 , but this is not enough to make up for the lower specific x - ray luminosity .",
    "the poor statistics in the open clusters left aside , cvs appear underrepresented in globular clusters as well , by about an order of magnitude .",
    "a likely explanation is that dynamical encounters have a net effect of destroying abs_both _ those with evolved components and wider orbits _ and _ main - sequence systems  and cvs . at the same time",
    ", the correlation with encounter rate found by @xcite implies that at least cvs are formed as well ; perhaps this is why the specific frequencies in open and globular clusters are less disparate for cvs than for abs .",
    "ab - like sub - subgiants are underabundant in globular clusters as well , but on the other hand sub - subgiants in ( candidate ) binary msps are not found in open clusters ( note that in table  [ tab_oc ] the different types of sub - subgiants are grouped together because some have not been studied well enough to make the distinction ) .",
    "the relative lack of abs in ngc6397 with respect to other globular clusters was already noted by @xcite and @xcite , who ascribed it to its post - collapsed state .",
    "we now show that 47tuc is deficient in abs , too .",
    "m4 , studied by @xcite and not included in table  [ tab_oc ] , shows the same effect . even if all fifteen sources or so that are brighter than @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 were abs ( which is not the case as there are also cvs , background and foreground sources , and an msp among them ) , it is not enough to reach the number of abs expected based on scaling by mass from open clusters . @xcite find a lower overall binary fraction in globulars compared to open clusters @xcite .",
    "if this is the result of binary destruction , the x - ray emitting , and thus hardest , binaries are affected as well .",
    "we can not exclude that other factors are important .",
    "there is a trend of decreasing ab frequency with age for all clusters in table  [ tab_oc ] except ngc6819 .    in @xcite",
    "it was first pointed out that the total _",
    "luminosity per unit mass of most globular clusters is lower than that of m67 . while m67 may be exceptional in some ways ( see sect .",
    "[ disc_oc ] ) , the last column of table  [ tab_oc ] shows that the specific x - ray luminosity of globular clusters may be lower than for open clusters in general .",
    "cvs , abs , and sub - subgiants are all responsible for this .",
    "the x - ray emission from qlmxbs and msps in globular clusters , of which there are no confirmed cases in old open clusters , can not make up for the lack of other types of faint sources .",
    "a more extensive investigation , based on a larger sample of globular clusters and old populations , is done by heinke et al .",
    "( in preparation ) to investigate the effects of age , central density , and metallicity on differences in the x - ray emissivity .",
    "we have studied ngc6791 , which is one of the oldest open clusters known , in x - rays for the first time . of the twenty _ chandra _ sources that are identified with proper - motion cluster members , nineteen are binaries .",
    "we find a mix of cvs , abs , and sub - subgiant binaries . with optical follow - up spectroscopy",
    "we confirm the classification of one cv in the cluster , and identify one new candidate cv .",
    "the origin of these and the other two cluster cvs is likely primordial .",
    "a comparison with the x - ray sources in the younger cluster ngc6819 suggests that in order to find numerous ( main - sequence ) abs brighter than @xmath93 erg s@xmath1 in open clusters , one must look at those older than @xmath32.5 gyr .",
    "the mass - specific frequency of main - sequence and sub - giant abs in ngc6791 ( 8 gyr ) is 37 times lower than in m67 ( 4 gyr ) ; it is not clear why this is the case .",
    "comparison with a small number of globular clusters shows that all three source classes that are mainly responsible for the x - ray emission from old open clusters are under - represented in the globulars .",
    "this accounts for the lower total x - ray luminosity per unit mass of globular clusters , and indicates that the net effect of dynamical encounters may be destruction of  even the hardest  binaries .",
    "the cutoff luminosity for comparing source populations among clusters was set at @xmath94 erg s@xmath1 ( 0.37 kev ) .",
    "a lower cutoff luminosity might be needed to account for effects of variations of the ab x - ray luminosity function with age or metallicity .",
    "while @xcite note that population - ii abs may have lower x - ray luminosities , it remains unclear in this context why ngc6791 , which has a super - solar metallicity , should also have relatively fewer abs above our limiting @xmath95 .",
    "we defer a more thorough investigation to a future study .",
    "deeper data are needed for ngc6791 to match the already deep existing data for m67 , 47tuc , and ngc6397 . the x - ray",
    "derived ab populations may then be compared to those derived from other wavelengths , e.g.  optical variability studies . also in this respect , studies of ngc6791 may benefit from being in the field of view of the _ kepler _ satellite .",

    "<S> we present the first x - ray study of ngc6791 , one of the oldest open clusters known ( 8 gyr ) . </S>",
    "<S> our _ chandra _ observation is aimed at uncovering the population of close interacting binaries down to @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ( 0.37 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 86 sources within 8  of the cluster center , including 59 inside the half - mass radius . </S>",
    "<S> we identify twenty sources with proper - motion cluster members , which are a mix of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , active binaries ( abs ) , and binaries containing sub - subgiants . with follow - up optical spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the nature of one cv . </S>",
    "<S> we discover one new , x - ray variable candidate cv with balmer and he  ii emission lines in its optical spectrum ; this is the first x - ray  selected cv confirmed in an open cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the number of cvs per unit mass is consistent with the field , suggesting that the 34 cvs observed in ngc6791 are primordial . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the x - ray properties of ngc6791 with those of a few old open ( ngc6819 , m67 ) and globular clusters ( 47tuc , ngc6397 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is puzzling that the number of abs brighter than @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 normalized by cluster mass is lower in ngc6791 than in m67 by a factor @xmath337 . </S>",
    "<S> cvs , abs , and sub - subgiants brighter than @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 are under - represented per unit mass in the globular clusters compared to the oldest open clusters , and this accounts for the lower total x - ray luminosity per unit mass of the former . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the net effect of dynamical encounters may be the destruction of even some of the hardest ( i.e.  x - ray  emitting ) binaries . </S>"
