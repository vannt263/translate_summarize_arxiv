    "for nearly half a century the theory of the weakly interacting bose gases ( wibg ) remained in the realm of purely theoretical investigations @xcite ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) providing insight into the nature of superfluid states of matter but not directly relating to existing experimental systems .",
    "the situation changed with the realization of bose einstein condensation in cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the typical values of the interaction parameter for alkali atoms are very small @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number density of the gas and @xmath2 is the @xmath3-wave scattering length .",
    "since 1995 both the theory of wibg and experiments have progressed with a close relationship between the two  @xcite .    until recently , existing mean - field and variational treatments such as the bogoliubov zero - temperature approximation and the finite - temperature quasi - condensate theory @xcite were capable of describing the data within the relatively large experimental uncertainties .",
    "however , the improvements in detection techniques , the studies of optical lattice systems in which the effective gas parameter can be made arbitrarily large , and the need for reliable thermometry , e.g. , through precise entropy matching , all indicate the need for a more accurate and controllable theory .",
    "it is highly desirable , similarly to the well - known corrections to the ground state energy @xcite and condensate density @xcite , to have a theory which accounts for leading corrections to all thermodynamic properties at finite temperature , works in any dimension , and provides estimates for omitted higher order terms .",
    "the accuracy of the description plays an important role in this paper .",
    "we systematically estimate the errors of all approximations , which is crucial for comparing seemingly different schemes proposed for bose gases . indeed , alternative theories can be equivalent to each other within the level of their accuracy , but a definitive conclusion",
    "can only be drawn on the basis of analyzing their systematic errors .",
    "for example , within the same accuracy gap - less and gap - full finite - temperature schemes may often be regarded as equivalent without any preference for one of them , as long as the gap is on the order of or smaller than the terms in the chemical potential which the theory ignores . also , in the fluctuation region all perturbative schemes are equally inaccurate in terms of their treatment of the order parameter , and it makes no sense whatsoever to distinguish between them by the type of the transition they predict .    in this work , we provide a rigorous framework for obtaining a consistent description of all thermodynamic finite-@xmath4 properties of the wibg in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "it is based on beliaev s regularized diagrammatic technique @xcite which allows us to calculate all relevant thermodynamic functions of the system .",
    "the diagrammatic technique also leads to an accurate description of correlation functions up to sufficiently large distances where popov s hydrodynamic description takes over @xcite .",
    "the key results of our calculations are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] , which is accessible to the general reader .",
    "it turns out that all final results for thermodynamic functions perfectly fit into the pseudo - hamiltonian picture , i.e. we prove that the same answers would be obtained if they were calculated in the standard way with bogoliubov s non - interacting quasi - particle picture ( with a self - consistently defined temperature dependent spectrum ) .",
    "in addition , we find an explicit expression for the pressure and give a more accurate expression for the chemical potential .",
    "we obtain the equations of state for all basic thermodynamic quantities in an integral parametric form using temperature , effective chemical potential , and the interaction strength as parameters .",
    "these results include sub - leading corrections .. at low enough temperatures , these quantities lose their ideal - gas leading terms , getting nothing instead  as opposed to energy , chemical potential , and pressure , having straight - forward mean - field contributions that start to lead at low temperatures . ]",
    "the analysis of systematic errors shows that the accuracy of our results can not be further improved within the paradigm of non - interacting quasiparticles with a ( temperature - dependent ) bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "moreover , there exists a two - parametric continuum of possibilities for recasting the form of the final answers with the same accuracy due to the freedom of modifying the definitions of approximate notions of `` effective interaction '' and `` effective chemical potential '' . using this freedom",
    ", one can trade the higher order terms in the explicit integral expressions for the thermodynamic quantities for those of the effective interaction vertex .",
    "our analysis shows that the question of the energy and momentum dependence of the interaction vertex is more a matter of taste rather than accuracy .",
    "we show that even in 2d  where , in view of the vanishing @xmath3-scattering amplitude , a low - energy cutoff is unavoidable and one could expect that the momentum - dependent effective - interaction vertex is crucially important in any theory taking care of sub - leading corrections  the effects associated with the energy and momentum dependence of the effective interaction can be naturally accounted for on equal footing with all the other effects of the same order . within the systematic error bars of our pseudo - hamiltonian approach ,",
    "the effective interaction of the 2d wibg can be safely treated as an energy and momentum independent constant .",
    "such analytical approaches are not supposed to work in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath5 .",
    "this so - called fluctuation region is characterized by scaling functions that are universal for all u(1 ) weakly - interacting systems .",
    "it has already been studied numerically with high accuracy @xcite , so that a combination of analytical and numerical data provides an accurate description at all temperatures .    despite its success in treating the weakly interacting bose gas , beliaev",
    "s original technique features a subtlety that has seriously questioned its reliability : the normal and anomalous self energies  the fundamental quantities of the theory  have been demonstrated to be essentially momentum - dependent , with the anomalous self - energy vanishing in the limit of zero momentum and frequency @xcite . on the other hand the first - order diagrams in the theory of the weakly interacting gas with a contact interaction yield momentum independent self energies . in the literature",
    ", one can find a number of recipes of how to deal with this inherent infrared problem of beliaev s technique . in popov s approach @xcite",
    ", the diagrammatic technique applies only to the higher - momentum part of the bosonic field , while the lower - momentum part is treated separately within the hydrodynamic representation .",
    "similar results can be achieved by working with a finite - size system and taking advantage of the bi - modality of correlation properties of weakly interacting superfluid bosonic systems ( away from the fluctuation region ) @xcite .",
    "the bi - modality allows one to select such a system size that in terms of local thermodynamic properties the system is already well in the macroscopic limit while the effect of the infra - red renormalization of the self energies is still negligibly small .",
    "another option of a controllable microscopic description of weakly interacting bose gas is the renormalization - group treatment @xcite .",
    "similar to the finite - size regularization , our approach is to exploit the bi - modality of correlation properties of the wibg , see figure  [ fig : bimodal ] , by cutting off infra - red divergencies using small u(1 ) symmetry breaking terms .",
    "the amplitude of the symmetry - breaking terms is such that their effect on the local thermodynamic properties of the system is negligibly small while all infrared singularities in beliaev s technique are gone .",
    "clearly , the solution to the infrared problem comes at the expense of suppressing long - range fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter ( with opening of a gap in the spectrum at small momenta ) , and thus distorting the long - range behaviour of correlation functions",
    ". nevertheless , this distortion is essentially irrelevant since it takes place at large distances where the ( generic to all superfluids ) behaviour of correlators is governed by hydrodynamic fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter , with a simple and transparent theoretical description @xcite . moreover , in all final answers one can explicitly take the limit of vanishing symmetry breaking terms .    in terms of the final results ,",
    "we confine our analysis to the most typical ( and most difficult in two and three dimensions ) case of the dilute gas , when the size of the potential @xmath6 is much smaller than the distance between the particles : @xmath7 in principle , the theory works also at @xmath8 , and becomes even simpler , since in this case the weakness of interaction literally implies born type of the potential ( while in the opposite case the amplitude of potential can be arbitrarily large in two and three dimensions ) .",
    "however , only with the condition ( [ dilute ] ) the final answers become insensitive to the details of the interaction potential .",
    "the second condition which is assumed in our final results is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the de broglie wavelength .",
    "given the inequality ( [ dilute ] ) , the condition ( [ lambda_t_vs_r_0 ] ) is satisfied _ automatically _ as long as one is interested in essentially quantum properties of the system , implying @xmath11 .",
    "an extension of the theory to the boltzmann high - temperature regime @xmath12 , where answers become sensitive to the particular form of the interaction potential , goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we first summarize the key results of our approach for thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions in a form easily accessible to the general reader .",
    "the next chapters systematically introduce the technique and derive the results . in section [ sec : diagrams ] we re - derive the diagrammatic technique for the phase with the broken u(1 ) symmetry by introducing explicit ( arbitrary small ) symmetry breaking terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we keep the discussion as general as possible to cover inhomogeneous , e.g.  trapped , systems and states with non - zero average current . in section [ sec : diagrams ] we also derive the central expressions for the proper self energies and chemical potential . in section [ sec : quasicondensate ] we consider thermodynamics ( including the superfluid density ) of a homogeneous system in the superfluid phase . in particular , we introduce the notion of the renormalized chemical potential @xmath13 and show that @xmath13 and temperature form a natural pair of thermodynamic parameters , in terms of which all the other quantities are obtained from the single - particle momentum - space integrals . in section [ sec : estimates ] we discuss , at the order - of - magnitude level , the structure of higher - order corrections to the spectrum of elementary excitations and thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this analysis , in particular , leads to the conclusion that within the pseudo - hamiltonian approximation and bogoliubov ansatz for the spectrum of elementary excitations our results can not be further improved . in section [ sec : off ]",
    "we show that the answers for the asymptotic long - range behaviour of off - diagonal correlation functions are readily obtained on top of beliaev s diagrammatic treatment for medium - range correlations , by employing the generic hydrodynamic description of a superfluid . the short section [ sec : normal_region ] deals with the normal region . in section",
    "[ sec : pseudo ] we show that in both normal and superfluid regimes ( but away from the fluctuation region around the critical point ) the thermodynamic relations can be associated with a pseudo - hamiltonian in the following sense .",
    "the partition function and the entropy of the system turn out to correspond to those of a non - interacting bosonic hamiltonian with temperature - dependent parameters and a temperature - dependent global energy shift . in section [ sec : fluct ]",
    "we render the results for the fluctuation region , which previously were obtained in 2d and 3d , but not in 1d . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we finally compare our solutions with first - principle monte carlo data for wibg both in continuous space and on a lattice .",
    "here we summarize the most important relations which we derive in the main part of the paper , assuming that the conditions ( [ dilute ] ) and ( [ lambda_t_vs_r_0 ] ) are met .",
    "the results of this section work for both continuous - space and lattice systems ; in the latter case , the mass @xmath14 is understood as the effective mass of low - energy motion .",
    "the equilibrium state of the system is conveniently parametrized by two independent variables , the temperature @xmath4 and the effective chemical potential @xmath15 . the latter is always negative , so that @xmath16 .",

    "a representational freedom allows one to use slightly different expressions for @xmath17 , without sacrificing the order of accuracy .",
    "our particular choice is @xmath20 in three dimensions , and @xmath21 in two dimensions , where @xmath22 is euler s constant .",
    "a particular expression for @xmath17 comes from fixing the specific form of an auxiliary function @xmath23 .",
    "the latter enters thermodynamic relations in such a way that the values of those remain insensitive  up to irrelevant higher - order corrections  to slightly changing @xmath17 by adopting a slightly different @xmath24 .",
    "equations ( [ u_3d_gas ] ) and ( [ u_2d_gas ] ) correspond to @xmath25 @xmath26 respectively , where @xmath27 is the particle dispersion relation . in one dimension @xmath28 . within the representational freedom , different choices of the @xmath29-pair",

    "equation ( [ rel1 ] ) implies the following relation for @xmath291 : @xmath539\\nonumber \\\\ + \\ ,   ( m^{2d } t^4 u^d)^{1\\over 4-d}\\int_0^x   \\lambda^{(d)}(x')\\ , { \\rm d } x ' \\ , , \\label{param_p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then with ( [ s2])-([e1 ] ) one obtains similar relations for @xmath3 and @xmath257 .",
    "to see how accurate our description is for the density matrix we performed monte carlo simulations of weakly interacting two- and one - dimensional systems where phase fluctuations are the strongest .",
    "we deliberately aim at systems with substantial decay of the density matrix to see the difference between the perturbative treatment and exact solution . in figure",
    "[ fig : rho2d ] we present data for the two dimensional square - lattice system described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath540   \\ ; , \\label{bh}\\ ] ] where @xmath541 is the hopping amplitude between the nearest neighbor sites . model ( [ bh ] ) was simulated for @xmath542 , @xmath543 and filling factor @xmath544 on a lattice with @xmath545 points by using the worm algorithm approach @xcite .",
    "formally , all expressions in this manuscript relating energy spectrum , particle density , and density matrix remain valid for an arbitrary dispersion relation with @xmath546 at small momenta .",
    "moreover , the theory is supposed to work as written for systems with periodic boundary conditions provided the sums over momenta are understood as @xmath547 , where @xmath548 and @xmath549 is a @xmath550-dimensional integer . to suppress statistical noise ,",
    "simulation data for @xmath551 were collected to spherically symmetric bins .",
    "we are using exactly the same procedure to present theoretical data .",
    "thus , the only difference between the essentially exact ( up to statistical errors ) simulation data and the theory is due to the finite value of @xmath17 . even for relatively large values of @xmath17 and temperature @xmath552",
    "we observe a remarkable accuracy of ( [ spdm_2 ] ) .",
    "one can get an idea of the systematic theoretical error by comparing curves derived from ( [ spdm_2 ] ) and ( [ spdm_3 ] ) . [ the latter is obtained by exponentiating the phase correlator at large distances ] .    in figure  [",
    "fig : rho1d ] we apply our theory to the lieb - liniger model of the one - dimensional bose gas with contact interactions . since exact correlation functions at finite temperature",
    "are not known , we performed monte carlo simulations using recently developed techniques for continuous space systems @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the on - dimensional characteristic length @xmath553 as the unit of length .",
    "the limit of weak interactions is obtained then by considering large densities @xmath554 , and we have chosen @xmath555 corresponding to the power law - decay of off - diagonal correlations at zero temperature with the exponent @xmath556 .",
    "the upper curve in figure  [ fig : rho1d ] shows results for low temperature @xmath557 , or @xmath558 when thermal phase fluctuations are barely influencing the data for the simulated system size @xmath559 .",
    "when temperature is increased to @xmath560 ( lower curve in figure  [ fig : rho1d ] ) we clearly see the bimodal decay of the density matrix and the crossover from the power - law to exponential decay .",
    "contrary to the 2d case , equation ( [ spdm_3 ] ) captures the actual behaviour better than ( [ spdm_2 ] ) which is not so surprising given the large suppression of @xmath456 at large distances .",
    "finally , figures [ fig : energyn_comparison ] and [ fig : pressuren_comparison ] show the agreement of monte carlo results for the energy ( squares ) and the pressure ( triangles ) at temperatures @xmath561 with theoretical curves from ( [ e_nrml ] ) and ( [ p_normal ] ) ( solid lines ) .    in the following we compare thermodynamic functions obtained in sections [ sec : quasicondensate ] and [ sec : normal_region ] with exact quantum monte carlo results of a weakly interacting three - dimensional system .",
    "let us start with the case of a homogeneous system with a small parameter @xmath562 . in figures [ fig : energyqc_comparison ] and",
    "[ fig : pressureqc_comparison ] we compare monte carlo results for the energy ( squares ) per particle and pressure ( triangles ) at temperatures @xmath347 , with the theoretical curves from ( [ e_cnd ] ) and ( [ p3 ] ) ( solid lines ) .",
    "the analytical expressions are in very good agreement with numerical results up to temperatures @xmath563 and there is no need to switch to the description in terms of universal functions @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate ( [ p_e_s_fluct ] ) showing that fluctuation contributions to energy and pressure are very small .",
    "the same does not apply to the superfluid and condensate densities for which the perturabtive expansion in @xmath17 is not valid as fluctuations of the order parameter can not be neglected on approach to the critical temperature . in figure  ( [ fig : nsf_ncnd_comparison ] ) squares and triangles are the results of quantum monte carlo simulations for the superfluid and condensate fraction , respectively .",
    "solid and dashed lines are the theoretical expressions from ( [ nslandau ] ) for the superfluid density and ( [ n_total ] ) for the condensate density , respectively , combined with preexisting classical monte carlo results  @xcite for the fluctuation region . at a temperature @xmath564 we switch to the universal description , as @xmath565 [ see ( [ gamma_t_rel3 ] ) ] becomes of the order of unity . for @xmath563",
    "the remaining discrepancy between classical and quantum monte carlo results is due to finite interaction strength .",
    "one should not be misled by the small value of the gas parameter in the fluctuation region since the proper parameter controlling the size of the fluctuation region in temperature , @xmath566 , and the accuracy of the universal description involves a large numerical prefactor and is rather @xmath567 , see @xcite .",
    "we have shown that beliaev s diagrammatic technique regularized by adding a small term explicitly breaking the u(1 ) symmetry to the hamiltonian yields a simple and controllable description of the weakly interacting bose gas in any dimension .",
    "this approach is especially convenient for obtaining thermodynamic functions that are not sensitive ( up to higher - order corrections ) to the long - range phase fluctuations .",
    "the symmetry breaking term introduces a small gap in the otherwise gapless goldstone mode and suppresses long - range fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter , thereby introducing a genuine condensate density and thus substantially simplifying the description of lower - dimensional systems . in this sense ,",
    "the symmetry - breaking trick is an alternative to berezinskii s finite - size trick and popov s special ( hydrodynamic ) treatment of long - wave parts of the fields . at the end of the calculation ,",
    "the symmetry breaking term is set to zero .    another important feature of our approach is that it completely avoids such notions as seed- or quasi - condensate for its construction .",
    "the quasi - condensate density defined as the modulus squared of the order parameter field at distances larger then the healing length is calculated as the long - wave property of the theory , rather than serving as an input parameter .",
    "it is only natural to have the theory which handles the short - range physics first and uses it for dealing with the low - energy physics next .",
    "as far as long - range off - diagonal correlations are concerned , the approach produces accurate answers for the off - diagonal correlation functions up to distances where further evolution of the correlators is controlled by generic hydrodynamic relations , and thus can be accurately extrapolated to arbitrarily large distances .",
    "we confined our analysis to the most typical and non - trivial ( in 2d and 3d ) case of dilute gas , when the size of the potential @xmath6 is much smaller than the distance between the particles .",
    "in the ( boltzmann ) high - temperature regime , we have restricted ourselves to low enough temperatures at which de broglie wavelength remains much larger than @xmath6 and the answers do not depend on the details of the pair potential . under the two above - mentioned conditions ,",
    "the effective inter - particle interaction is described by a single parameter @xmath17 .",
    "technically , generalization of the theory to the case of @xmath8 is straightforward . in this case",
    ", the weakness of interaction literally means born interaction potential , and complete summation of ladder diagrams in 2d and 3d becomes irrelevant .",
    "the description of a normal gas at @xmath568 is a well - studied topic that goes beyond the scope of the present paper .    the pair of variables @xmath569 and @xmath4 form the most convenient set of parameters determining the rest of thermodynamic quantities , including the condensate density , if any .",
    "the structure of the answers corresponds to a picture of non - interacting bosonic quasiparticles with the bogoliubov spectrum ( [ e2 ] ) , on top of the ` vacuum ' with temperature - dependent energy .",
    "this allows one to introduce the bilinear bosonic pseudo - hamiltonian ( [ h_ps ] ) with bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "we argue that within the bilinear pseudo - hamiltonian ansatz our results can not be further improved at least at @xmath385 . in the @xmath392 limit ,",
    "when thermodynamics is exhausted by dilute non - interacting phonons , using the improved value of the sound velocity obtained directly from the zero - temperature compressibility , yields more accurate answers for thermodynamic quantities , but is inconsistent with retaining the bogoliubov form of the spectrum for _ all _ the momenta .",
    "we also show that any attempt to improve the self - consistent mean - field description of the superfluid region , aimed at getting rid of the spurious first - order phase transition , is senseless as long as the fluctuation - induced non - perturbative shift of the critical temperature is not accounted for .",
    "in fact , there is no need to extrapolate the pseudo - hamiltonian description to the fluctuation region around the critical temperature in view of the availability of the numerical answers for universal scaling functions describing all the weakly interacting u(1 ) systems at @xmath570 . with these data , the two analytical descriptions  in the normal and superfluid phases  are readily connected across the fluctuation region . by comparing our results to first - principles mote carlo data , we observe that the most vulnerable region of parameters is @xmath570 , where the description is accurate only when the gas parameter @xmath571 is as small as @xmath572 .",
