    "the notion of @xmath0-orthocenter is define in strictly convex minkowski plane because the strictly convex property guarantees that there exists only one circle passing through the three different points , i.e , each triangle with circumcenter has one and only one .",
    "note that the way asplund and grnbaum used to define the notion of @xmath0-orthocenter needs three different circles of the circumcircle . however , there are cases where no three different circles exist of the circumcircle that holds the hypothesis of the previous theorem and therefore , in this situation we have a problem with this way to define the @xmath0-orthocenter .",
    "another problem with the definition of asplund and grnbaum is that there are cases where the intersection of the three circles is more than one point and therefore , how to known which point is the @xmath0-orthocenter of the triangle .",
    "on the other hand , in minkowski planes there are cases where a triangle can have many or not have it and therefore , the same happen with the , but as our intention is to characterize the euclidianity in minkowski planes , by studying some geometric properties of the @xmath0-orthocentric systems , we will on defining the notion of @xmath0-orthocenter for triangles having circumcenter . the problem here is how to decide which is associates with a particular circumcenter , when the triangle has many circumcenters .",
