    "the so - called giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) was discovered experimentally twenty years ago by fert and coworkers@xcite and by grunberg@xcite . since then",
    ", intensive investigations , both experimentally and theoretically , have been carried out to understand the origin and the behaviors of the spin current in magnetic multilayer systems.@xcite this spectacular development is due mainly to an important number of industrial applications using such systems in data storage and magnetic sensors.@xcite    experimental observations show that when the spin of an itinerant spin is parallel to the spins of the environment it will go through easily while it will be stopped if it encounters an antiparallel spin medium .",
    "the resistance is stronger in the latter case resulting in a gmr .",
    "although many theoretical investigations have been carried out , detailed understanding of the influence of each physical parameter on the spin current is still lacking .",
    "for example the role of interface scattering and the effect of interface roughness on the gmr are still currently investigated ( see for example refs . and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , to date no monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have been performed regarding the temperature dependence of the dynamics of spins participating in the current .",
    "this defines the aim of this work .",
    "this paper deals with the transport of spins in a system composed of three magnetic films .",
    "we show that the spin current depends on the orientation of the lattice spins found on the trajectory .",
    "the dependence of the spin transport on the magnetic ordering , i.e. , on the temperature is studied .",
    "the difficulty of the task is that we have to deal at the same time with surface and interface effects and with dynamical properties of itinerant spins interacting with the lattice spins .",
    "surface physics of systems such as films and multilayers have been enormously studied at equilibrium during the last 30 years .",
    "this was motivated in particular by applications in magnetic recording , let alone fundamental theoretical interests .",
    "much is understood theoretically and experimentally in thin films whose surfaces are clean , i.e. , contain no impurities , no steps etc . @xcite far less is known  at least theoretically  on complicated thin films with special surface conditions such as defects , arrays of dots and magnetization reversal phenomena . as a result ,",
    "studying the behavior of itinerant electrons injected into such systems is a formidable task which can not be fulfilled in every respect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the description of our model and the rules that govern its dynamics .",
    "we take into account ( i ) interactions between itinerant and lattice spins , and ( ii ) interactions between itinerant spins themselves ( iii ) interactions between lattice spins .",
    "where rules governing the dynamics are concerned , we include a thermodynamic force due to the gradient of itinerant spin concentration , an applied electric field that drives electrons , and the effect of a magnetic field . in section iii , we describe our mc method and discuss the results we obtained for several physical quantities in various situations , e.g. , the mean free - path , the spin current and the resistance . comparison with a very recent experiment@xcite performed on a permalloy - insulator multilayer is also shown in this section .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we consider in this paper three ferromagnetic films being antiferromagnetically coupled to each other via nonmagnetic layers .",
    "we use the ising model and the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice for the films .",
    "the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsstruct ] where the films are stacked along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the multilayer is made up of three films each of which has a volume given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the number of atomic layers ( i.e. , single film thickness ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in the @xmath5 planes .",
    "nonmagnetic spacers sandwiched between films have a thickness @xmath6 .",
    "spins at fcc lattice sites are called `` lattice spins '' hereafter .",
    "they interact with each other through the following hamiltonian :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the ising spin at lattice site @xmath9 , @xmath10 indicates the sum over every nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spin pair @xmath11 . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the case where all exchange interactions @xmath12 are ferromagnetic and equal to @xmath13 , except for the interaction across the nonmagnetic spacer which we define using the following rkky model , @xmath14 here , @xmath9 and @xmath15 refer to spins on either side of a nonmagnetic layer , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants chosen in such a way that the strength of @xmath12 is physically reasonable .",
    "the shape of the interaction is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : rkky ] .",
    "when the coupling across nonmagnetic layers is antiferromagnetic , the ground state corresponds to the two exterior films having spins pointing in one direction and the interior one spins pointing in the opposite direction .    in order to study the spin transport inside the multilayer system described above ,",
    "we consider a flow of itinerant spins interacting with each other and with the lattice spins .",
    "the interaction between itinerant spins is defined as follows ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the ising spin at position @xmath20 , and @xmath10 denotes a sum over every spin pair @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction @xmath22 depends on the distance between the two spins , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "a specific form of @xmath22 will be chosen below .",
    "the interaction between itinerant spins and lattice spins is given by    @xmath24    where the interaction @xmath25 depends on the distance between the itinerant spin @xmath19 and the lattice spin @xmath8 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume the same form for @xmath22 and @xmath25 , namely , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants expressing the respective strength of interactions .      let us now explain the procedure we utilize in our simulation .",
    "first we study the thermodynamic properties of the multilayer system alone , i.e. , without itinerant spins , using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamil1 ] ) . in this view",
    ", we perform mc simulations in order to determine quantities as the internal energy , the specific heat , layer magnetizations , the susceptibility , ... as functions of temperature @xmath0.@xcite from these physical quantities we determine the critical temperature @xmath1 below which the system is in the ordered phase , e.g. , with up - spin phase for the outer films and down - spin phase for the middle film .",
    "the total staggered lattice magnetization is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetization of the @xmath9th film .",
    "we depict in fig.[fig : m(t ) ] the lattice magnetization versus @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi ] shows the susceptibility calculated from the fluctuations of @xmath31 for two spacer thicknesses @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath1 is equal to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively for these spacers .",
    "once the lattice has been equilibrated at @xmath0 , we study the dynamics of itinerant spins at that temperature by injecting itinerant spins with a density @xmath35 into the multilayer system .",
    "there are two ways of doing this : i ) the itinerant spins move parallel to the film surface ( cip case ) ; ii ) the itinerant spins move perpendicular to the films ( cpp case ) . in this paper",
    "we show results in the cip case .",
    "the itinerant spins in the cip case move into the system at one end , travel in the @xmath36 direction , escape the system at the other end to reenter again at the first end under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "note that pbc are used to ensure that the average density of itinerant spins remains constant during the time ( stationary regime ) .",
    "the dynamics of itinerant spins is governed by the following interactions :    \\i ) an electric field @xmath37 is applied in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "its energy is given by @xmath38where @xmath39 is the velocity of the itinerant spin    \\ii ) a chemical potential term which depends on the concentration of itinerant spins within a sphere of radius @xmath40 ( `` concentration gradient '' effect ) .",
    "its form is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the concentration of itinerant spins in a sphere of radius @xmath40 centered at @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is a constant taken equal to @xmath27 for simplicity .",
    "\\iii ) interactions between a given itinerant spin and lattice spins inside a sphere of radius @xmath45 ( eq .  [ eqn : hamil3 ] ) .",
    "\\iv ) interactions between a given itinerant spin and other itinerant spins inside a sphere of radius @xmath40 ( eq .  [ eqn : hamil2 ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the case without an applied magnetic field .",
    "the simulation is carried out as follows : at a given @xmath0 we calculate the energy of an itinerant spin by taking into account all the interactions described above .",
    "then we tentatively move the spin under consideration to a new position with a step of length @xmath46 in an arbitrary direction .",
    "note that this move is immediately rejected if the new position is inside a sphere of radius @xmath47 centered at a lattice spin or an itinerant spin .",
    "this excluded space emulates the pauli exclusion principle in the one hand , and the interaction with lattice phonons on the other hand . for the sake of example ,",
    "if the spacing between nn lattice spins is @xmath48 then @xmath47 is taken of the order of 0.05 .",
    "this value can be made temperature - dependent to account for the cross section of phonon - electrons collisions .",
    "if the new position does not lie in a forbidden region of space , then the move is accepted with a probability given by the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite ; in particular , it is always accepted if the energy of the itinerant spin at the new position is lower than its previous value .",
    "in this paragraph , we show the results obtained by mc simulations with the hamiltonians given above .",
    "all ising spins are of magnitude @xmath49 .",
    "the parameters we use in most calculations are , except otherwise stated , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the dimension of the films , @xmath53 for the spacer thickness .",
    "we also make use of pbc in the @xmath5 plane .    at each temperature",
    "the equilibration time for the lattice spins lies around @xmath54 mc steps per spin and we compute statistical averages over @xmath54 mc steps per spin . taking @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath56 for the estimate of the critical temperature of the lattice spins ( see figs.[fig : m(t ) ] and [ fig : chi ] ) . before calculating the mean free path and the spin current ,",
    "we let @xmath35 itinerant spins travel through the system several thousands times until a steady state is reached .",
    "the parameters used for the results shown below are @xmath57 ( in unit of the fcc cell length ) , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfp ] we sketch the travelling length @xmath62 computed after a fixed lapse of time as a function of temperature @xmath0 . as can be seen",
    ", @xmath62 is very large at @xmath63 .",
    "we note that there is a small depression in the transition region",
    ". we will show below that this has important consequences on the spin current .",
    "we also note that at very low @xmath0 ( @xmath64 ) , the mean free path suffers a decrease with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this is a well - known artefact of mc simulation at very low @xmath0 : the moving probability is so small that the motion of itinerant spins is somewhat slowed down . as we will show below when comparing with experimental data , this freezing",
    "is also observed in real systems due to finite experimental observation time .",
    "figures [ fig : d1 ] and [ fig : d2 ] show the effects of varying @xmath45 and @xmath40 at a low temperature @xmath65 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] , @xmath62 is very large at small @xmath45 : this can be explained by the fact that for such small @xmath45 , itinerant spins do not `` see '' lattice spins in their interaction sphere so they move almost in an empty space .",
    "the effect of @xmath40 is on the other hand qualitatively very different from that of @xmath45 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] : @xmath62 is saturated at small @xmath40 and decreases to the minimum value , namely @xmath62=1 , at large @xmath40 .",
    "we conclude that both @xmath45 and @xmath40 dominate @xmath62 at their small values .",
    "however , at large values , only @xmath40 has a strong effect on @xmath62 .",
    "this effect comes naturally from the criterion on the itinerant spins concentration used in the moving procedure .",
    "the mean free path is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nz ] as a function of @xmath0 for two magnetic film thicknesses . in the absence of interface impurities",
    ", it is expected that there would be no large effects on the motion of itinerant spins .",
    "this is indeed what we observe here .",
    "note however that the mean free path for the smaller magnetic film thickness is systematically smaller than that of the thicker film .",
    "we will discuss on the role of interfaces below while showing the resistance ( fig .",
    "[ resist ] ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : nm ] the effect of the spacer thickness on the mean free path .",
    "note that for each thickness value we have used the inter film coupling constant @xmath66 calculated by eq .",
    "[ rkky ] . increasing the thickness",
    ", i. e. decreasing @xmath66 , will result in a decrease of the mean free path visible at low @xmath0 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nm ] .",
    "this is expected since the itinerant spins at magnetic - nonmagnetic interfaces have weaker inter film coupling energy , so they are scattered more easily .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] the effect of the electric field @xmath67 for @xmath0 both above and below @xmath1 .",
    "the low - field part verifies the ohm regime .    for the @xmath9-th layer",
    ", we define the resistivity as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of spins crossing a unit area perpendicular to the @xmath36 direction per unit of time . note",
    "that this definition is applied to three magnetic ( @xmath70 ) and two nonmagnetic layers ( @xmath71 ) . the total resistance @xmath72 is defined as    @xmath73    this definition is suitable for low-@xmath0 phase where the spin current is distinct in magnitude between magnetic and nonmagnetic layers . on the contrary , in the paramagnetic phase",
    "the spin current is almost spatially uniform , and the resistance can be defined as @xmath74    in fig .",
    "[ resist ] we show the resistance @xmath72 as a function of temperature .",
    "there are several striking points :    * @xmath72 is very low in the ordered phase and large in the paramagnetic phase . below the transition temperature",
    ", there exists a single large cluster with small - sized excitation inside it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : meansize ] ) , so that any itinerant spin having the appropriate orientation goes through the structure without any hindrance .",
    "the resistance is thus very small .",
    "* @xmath72 exhibits a cusp at the transition temperature , the existence of which was at first very surprising .",
    "while searching for its physical origin , we found that it was due to changes in the size distribution of clusters of lattice spins as the transition temperature is approached ; it is known indeed from the theory of critical phenomena that clusters of up ( resp .",
    "down ) spins of every size form when @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 in a critical phase transition . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the distribution of cluster sizes displays clusters of various sizes , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : clus ] ( more details on the cluster construction algorithm will be given below ) .",
    "as a result , the conductivity is drastically lower than in the ordered phase since itinerant electrons have to steer around large clusters in order to go through the entire structure .",
    "indeed thermal fluctuations are still not large enough to allow the itinerant spin to overcome the energy barrier created by the opposite orientation of the clusters ; this is all the more influential that we fixed an infinite spin - flip time , and this forbids the itinerant electron to reverse its orientation in order to reduce energy barriers . * below @xmath1",
    ", there is no effect of magnetic layer thickness on @xmath72 .",
    "however , for @xmath75 , the larger thickness yields a smaller @xmath72 .",
    "this can be explained by the effect of interfaces at nonmagnetic spacers : near @xmath1 the lattice spins at those interfaces are more strongly disordered than the bulk lattice spins , they therefore enhance the resistance .",
    "the importance of this contribution to the enhancement of the total resistance depends on the ratio of interface spins to bulk spins .",
    "this ratio becomes smaller when the magnetic layer thickness is larger .    far above @xmath1",
    ", most clusters have a small size , so that the resistivity is still quite large with respect to the low-@xmath0 phase .",
    "however , a few facts account for the decrease of the resistivity as @xmath0 is increased : ( i ) thermal fluctuations are now sufficient to help the itinerant spin overcome energy barriers that may occur when it bumps into islands of opposite orientation ; ( ii ) the cluster size is now comparable with the radius @xmath45 of the interaction sphere , which in turns reduces the height of potential energy barriers .    we have pitted this interpretation by first creating an artificial structure of alternate clusters of opposite spins and then injecting itinerant spins into the structure .",
    "we observed that itinerant spins do advance indeed more slowly than in the completely disordered phase ( high-@xmath0 paramagnetic phase ) .",
    "this finding is very interesting .",
    "we believe that it will have other important related physical effects yet to be discovered .    in order to show the existence of clusters at a given temperature , we have used the kopelman algorithm to construct clusters @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : clus ] the distribution of cluster size at different temperatures . as can be seen ,",
    "the distribution peak is enlarged with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : meansize](a ) the cluster size @xmath76 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : meansize](b ) shows the @xmath77 scale of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "the slope is @xmath79 indicating that @xmath76 does not depend significantly on @xmath0 at @xmath63 as expected .    at this stage",
    ", it is worth to make a comparison with a recent experiment performed on ni@xmath80fe@xmath81/al@xmath82o@xmath83 multilayer by brucas and hanson.@xcite this system is a magnetic permalloy / insulator multilayer which is very similar to our model : magnetic layers of thickness @xmath84 ( in the authors notation ) are separated by insulator of fixed thickness of 16 @xmath85 .",
    "measures of magnetization and resistance have been carried out as functions of @xmath0 for two thicknesses @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath85 .    for @xmath86 @xmath85 , x - ray reflectivity ,",
    "transmission electron microscopy and kerr measurements have shown that the magnetic layers are ferromagnetic with @xmath88 k. they found that ( see fig .",
    "2a of ref . )",
    "the resistance is very small at low @xmath0 ( except for very low @xmath0 ) , increases slowly with increasing @xmath0 , makes a jump at @xmath1 and saturated at room temperature 300 k. this behavior is very similar to what we obtained in the present paper .",
    "we note however that our model gives a sharper jump than experimental data .",
    "this is due to the perfect crystalline structure ( without impurities and defects ) of our model which is certainly not the case of the experimental system . besides , at very low @xmath0 ( @xmath89 25 k ) , due to thermally frozen dynamics , experimental measures show an anomaly also very similar to mc results at very low @xmath0 : the decrease of @xmath62 with decreasing @xmath0 shown in fig . [",
    "fig : mfp ] at t@xmath894 means an increase of @xmath72 with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "both experimental and theoretical systems show therefore a long - relaxation effect due to finite observation time .    for @xmath90 @xmath85 ,",
    "the magnetic layers of the experimental system are in fact composed of superparamagnetic domains .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath86 @xmath85 , the resistance in the case of @xmath90 @xmath85 decreases with increasing @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "2b of ref . ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the experimental system in this case , which is composed of superparamagnetic domains , is equivalent to our model in the paramagnetic region above @xmath1 where the existence of domains of clusters is shown above .",
    "the behavior of the resistance observed in our model for @xmath75 is in excellent agreement with experimental data ( see fig .",
    "[ resist ] at @xmath75 ) .",
    "the effect of domains on the resistance discovered in our present model is thus verified by this experiment .",
    "finally we show the effect of a magnetic field @xmath91 applied in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "if the inter magnetic film coupling is @xmath92 , then in the ground state , we need a critical field @xmath93 to align all spins in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : aim(t ) ] the lattice staggered magnetization at @xmath91=0 , 0.5 and 2 .",
    "as seen , for @xmath94 all lattice spins are aligned in the @xmath2 direction at low @xmath0 : the staggered magnetization is then equal to @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
    "an applied field much smaller than @xmath97 is expected not to modify significantly the itinerant spin current at @xmath98 .    in order to show the effect of the magnetic field strength , we define the following quantity termed as `` magnetoresistance '' hereafter @xmath99    we now show in fig . [",
    "fig : mrb1 ] the magnetoresistance in a weak field as a function of @xmath0 . at low @xmath0 ,",
    "no significant magnetoresistance is expected since itinerant spins are parallel to lattice spins .",
    "the same is observed at @xmath0 much larger than @xmath1 : the lattice spins are parallel to the applied field , so itinerant spins will go through the lattice without resistance .",
    "however , at @xmath0 slightly larger than @xmath1 we observe a large peak of the resistance .",
    "this peak has the same origin as that observed in fig .",
    "[ resist ] , namely it is due to the existence of the structure of domains in the transition region .    for large fields , the same is observed except that the peak is wider and stronger as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrb1 ] for @xmath94 .",
    "we have studied , by means of mc simulations , the transport of itinerant spins interacting with localized lattice spins in a trilayer system of fcc lattice structure in the cip configuration .",
    "various interactions have been taken into account .",
    "we found that the spin current is strongly dependent on the lattice spin ordering : at low @xmath0 itinerant spins whose direction is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the lattice spins yield a strong ( weak ) current . at high temperatures ,",
    "the lattice spins are disordered , the current of itinerant spins is very weak and does not depend on the input orientation of itinerant spins . as a consequence",
    ", the resistance is very high at high @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to emphasize here a striking effect found in the transition region between low-@xmath0 ordered phase and high-@xmath0 paramagnetic phase : at @xmath0 slightly higher than @xmath1 , we discovered a peak of the resistance due to the existence of domains of lattice spins .",
    "such an existence of domains in the critical temperature region is well known from the theory of critical phenomena , but no one has expected that it would play an important role in the spin transport . while writing this paper , we discovered a just - appeared experimental paper@xcite which supports our finding on the effect of domains in the resistance behavior .",
    "we have also investigated the effects on the spin current of different parameters which enter in our model : nonmagnetic spacer thickness , interaction range , electric field , and magnetic field .",
    "physical meaning of each of these effects has been discussed .",
    "let us note that so far , except ref .",
    ", most magnetoresistance experiments have been performed as a function of an applied magnetic field , at a given temperature . while , in our present study , we have considered the effect of the lattice ordering on the spin current .",
    "we think that in the light of the results obtained here , more experiments should be performed to investigate the effect of multilayer ordering on the spin transport . as a final remark",
    ", we note that the cpp case is perhaps more difficult to study because effects from non magnetic spacers as well as from impurities and roughness at interfaces will fully set in .",
