    "the unitarity corrections to scattering lengths for @xmath224 scattering had been studied in refs . @xcite with such a method .",
    "one may also consider coupled channel effects like the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite with this method . to consider the resonance effects from t and u channels for @xmath11 scattering , a more complete treatment on the left - cut is possible because there the chiral expansion has been carried out to @xmath225 .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the chiral corrections to the s - wave meson - baryon scattering lengths to the third chiral order in su(3 ) hb@xmath2pt .",
    "hopefully these explicit expressions of chiral corrections will be helpful to the chiral extrapolations of the scattering lengths in the future lattice simulations .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "there is a good possibility of measuring these meson - baryon scattering lengths experimentally from the strangeness program at csr , lan - zhou and jhf in the near future .",
    "therefore we have also done some numerical analysis of these scattering lengths based on the available experimental information .",
    "we find that the chiral expansion converges quite well in several channels .",
    "hence , hb@xmath2pt predictions of these scattering lengths are reliable , which may be useful to the construction of the meson - baryon interaction models .",
