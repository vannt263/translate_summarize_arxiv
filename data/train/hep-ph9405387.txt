    "in 1976 t hooft @xcite observed that the standard model does not absolutely conserve baryon and lepton number due to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly .",
    "in particular t hooft considered spontaneous fermion number violation due to instanton transitions between topologically inequivalent vacua .",
    "recently fermion number violating tunnelling transitions at high energies attracted much attention @xcite .    in 1983",
    "manton @xcite reconsidered the possibility of fermion number violation in the electroweak theory . by constructing a non - contractible loop in the configuration space of the weinberg - salam theory",
    "manton predicted the existence of a static , unstable solution of the field equations , a sphaleron @xcite , representing the top of the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua .",
    "the sphaleron is relevant in cosmology for the baryon asymmetry of the universe . at finite temperature",
    "the energy barrier between distinct vacua can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations of the fields , and vacuum to vacuum transitions can occur , accompanied by a change of baryon and lepton number .",
    "the rate for such baryon number violating processes is largely determined by a boltzmann factor , containing the height of the barrier at a given temperature , and thus by the energy of the sphaleron @xcite .",
    "the non - contractible loop constructed by manton @xcite corresponds to a non - trivial mapping @xmath3 with winding number one .",
    "since @xmath4 , there exist non - contractible loops with higher winding numbers .",
    "while the minimal maximal energy configuration along the loops with winding number one corresponds to the sphaleron , there should be analogous extremal configurations for the loops with higher winding numbers . correspondingly there",
    "should exist further unstable solutions of the weinberg - salam theory , multisphalerons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the configuration space of the weinberg - salam theory further and construct multisphaleron solutions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the sphaleron @xcite which is spherically symmetric for zero mixing angle , the multisphaleron solutions are only axially symmetric , even for zero mixing angle @xcite .",
    "the appropriate ansatz for the multisphalerons represents a generalization of the axially symmetric ansatz for the sphaleron at finite mixing angle @xcite , preserving the invariance under parity .",
    "the ansatz for the multisphalerons contains an integer @xmath1 , representing the winding number with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath5 . while @xmath5 covers the full trigonometric circle once , the fields wind @xmath1 times around .",
    "the ansatz is thus analogous to the ansatz of manton @xcite and rebbi and rossi @xcite for multimonopole solutions of an su(2 ) gauge theory with a higgs triplet .",
    "the winding number @xmath1 also determines the chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions , @xmath6 , and thus also their baryon number @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we briefly review the weinberg - salam lagrangian , discuss the ansatz and present the resulting energy functional .",
    "we then point out a residual u(1 ) gauge invariance of the energy functional .",
    "after fixing the gauge we specify the boundary condition for the fields .",
    "we present the chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions , subject to these boundary conditions , and we consider the extraction of their electromagnetic properties . in section 3",
    "we discuss the numerical procedure for solving the seven coupled non - linear partial differential equations .",
    "we then present the numerical results for the multisphaleron solutions with @xmath7 for various values of the higgs mass . while the multisphalerons were briefly described in @xcite for zero mixing angle , we here consider the full range of the mixing angle , @xmath8 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "let us consider the bosonic sector of the weinberg - salam theory @xmath9 with the su(2)@xmath10 field strength tensor @xmath11 with the u(1 ) field strength tensor @xmath12 and the covariant derivative for the higgs field @xmath13 the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath14 of the higgs field @xmath15 leading to the boson masses @xmath16 the mixing angle @xmath17 is determined by the relation @xmath18 , and the electric charge is @xmath19 .",
    "gauge field configurations can be classified by a charge , the chern - simons charge .",
    "the chern - simons current is not conserved , its divergence represents the u(1 ) anomaly of the baryon current .",
    "the su(2 ) chern - simons current is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and the su(2 ) chern - simons charge of a configuration is given by @xmath23 for the vacua the chern - simons charge is identical to the integer winding number , while the sphaleron has a chern - simons charge of 1/2 @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the ansatz for the multisphaleron solutions .",
    "following manton @xcite and rebbi and rossi @xcite we define a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath24 and expand the fields as follows @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 this ansatz has axial symmetry , i.  e.  a rotation about the @xmath28-axis can be compensated by a suitable gauge transformation @xcite . to restrict the ansatz",
    "further we require invariance under the discrete transformation consisting of charge conjugation and reflection through the @xmath29-plane ( mirror symmetry ) .",
    "this leads to the conditions @xcite @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32      the resulting energy functional @xmath33 then has the axially symmetric contributions @xmath34",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36      the energy functional is still invariant under gauge transformations generated by @xmath37 analogous to @xcite .",
    "note , that under this transformation the 2-d higgs doublets @xmath38 and @xmath39 transform with angle @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , while the 2-d gauge field @xmath42 transforms inhomogeneously .",
    "here we fix this gauge degree of freedom by choosing the ` coulomb gauge ' condition @xcite @xmath43 this choice of gauge leads to regular solutions , while other choices of gauge are known to lead to singular solutions @xcite .",
    "in addition to axial , charge conjugation and mirror symmetry we also require parity reflection symmetry .",
    "changing to spherical coordinates and extracting the trivial @xmath44-dependence we specify the ansatz further @xcite + @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 note , that the spherically symmetric ansatz for the sphaleron corresponds to @xmath2 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( where the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to those of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the above ansatz , when inserted into the classical equations of motion in the chosen gauge , yields a set of coupled partial differential equations for the functions @xmath53 , to be solved numerically subject to certain boundary conditions . to obtain regular , finite energy solutions with the imposed symmetries , we take as boundary conditions for the functions @xmath53 @xmath54",
    "the chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions can be evaluated analogously to the chern - simons charge of the sphaleron @xcite . at spatial infinity",
    "the su(2 ) vector fields are pure gauge configurations @xmath55 with @xmath56 the proper gauge for evaluating the chern - simons charge is the gauge with @xmath57 at infinity , which is obtained with the transformation @xmath58 @xmath59 and the boundary conditions @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions is then given by @xmath62 where the su(2 ) chern - simons density is determined by @xcite @xmath63 eq .",
    "( 30 ) explicitly demonstrates the effect of a gauge transformation of the form ( 28 ) .",
    "only the first term of @xmath64 determines the su(2 ) chern - simons charge , since the derivative terms do not contribute , due to the boundary conditions for the functions @xmath53 and for @xmath65 .    since the u(1 )",
    "field does not contribute to the chern - simons charge @xcite , the full chern - simons charge is given by the su(2 ) chern - simons charge .",
    "we thus obtain for the multisphalerons the chern - simons charge @xmath66 independently of the higgs mass and of the mixing angle , reproducing the well - known chern - simons charge of the sphaleron , @xmath67 .",
    "the chern - simons charge of the sphaleron and of the multisphalerons corresponds to their baryonic charge , @xmath68 @xcite .      another interesting physical quantity characterizing",
    "the electroweak sphaleron is its magnetic moment @xmath69 .",
    "the electromagnetic field of the electroweak sphaleron has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the magnetic moment .",
    "it can be extracted from the long - range behaviour of the functions @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . to extract the magnetic moment we perform an ( asymptotic ) gauge transformation , which changes the asymptotically twisted higgs field from the ` coulomb gauge ' to the ` physical gauge ' , where the higgs field is asymptotically constant . applying this transformation to the su(2 )",
    "gauge field yields the ` physical ' asymptotic isospin-3 component of the gauge field , needed to construct the asymptotic behaviour of the electromagnetic field and of the massive @xmath75-field .",
    "the magnetic moment consists of a sequence of multipoles @xmath76 where the first terms are the dipole moment @xmath77 and the octupole moment @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "subject to the boundary conditions ( 25 ) we solve the equations numerically , using the dimensionless coordinate @xmath79 .",
    "we fix the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we vary the higgs mass , though most calculations presented are performed for @xmath82 ; and we vary the mixing angle over the full range @xmath8 , the physical value being @xmath83 .",
    "to obtain the multisphaleron solutions we start with the @xmath2 sphaleron solution as initial guess and increase the value of @xmath1 successively .",
    "the numerical calculations are based on the newton - raphson method .",
    "we use the program package fidisol @xcite which also provides us with an estimate of the discretization errors .",
    "the equations are discretized on a grid covering the integration regions @xmath84 up to @xmath85 and @xmath86 with typical grid sizes @xmath87 and @xmath88 in most calculations a method with a prescribed grid and order of consistency is used .",
    "the estimates of the discretization errors are on the order of @xmath89 , which suffices to extract the physical quantities with high accuracy .",
    "the calculations are more difficult for large higgs masses , @xmath90 .",
    "there a method with optimization of the grid and of the order of consistency is applied @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the solution can be thus improved until the estimate of the maximal discretization error is lower than a given limit , e.  g.  @xmath89 in our calculations .",
    "we first present the multisphaleron solutions in the limit of zero mixing angle . in this limit the u(1 ) field decouples and the function @xmath91",
    "can consistently be set to zero @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the gauge invariant properties of the axially symmetric multisphaleron solutions , the energy , the energy density and the length of the higgs field . in fig .  1 we display the energy @xmath92 of the @xmath93 multisphaleron , divided by the winding number @xmath1 , as a function of the higgs mass and",
    "compare it with the energy of the @xmath2 sphaleron .",
    "we also indicate the energy of the @xmath94 and 4 multisphalerons at several values of the higgs mass .",
    "the energy @xmath92 of the multisphalerons up to @xmath93 is also shown in table 1 for the higgs masses @xmath95 , @xmath82 and @xmath96 together with the ratio @xmath97 . for small higgs masses the energy of the multisphalerons is smaller than @xmath1 times the energy of the sphaleron . for large higgs masses the energy of the multisphalerons is larger than @xmath1 times the energy of the sphaleron .",

    "we now consider the case of finite mixing angle and specify to the higgs mass @xmath82 .    at finite mixing angle the sphaleron and",

    "the dipole moment @xmath77 can be extracted with good accuracy up to the mixing angle @xmath110 , beyond which the function @xmath91 increases rapidly , leading to large errors on @xmath91 and making the extraction of @xmath77 unreliable .",

    "we now consider the multisphalerons at the physical mixing angle @xmath83 .    in table 2",
    "we show the energy ( in tev ) of the multisphalerons up to @xmath93 at the physical mixing angle and compare it to the energy at zero mixing angle ( for the higgs mass @xmath82 ) . the change in energy due to the finite mixing angle is small , increasing from 1% for @xmath2 to 2% for @xmath93 .    in fig .",
