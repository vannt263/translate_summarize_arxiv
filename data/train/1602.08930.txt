    "during the last years , a number of magnetic studies focused on the detection of magnetic fields in massive early b and o - type stars .",
    "the characterization of magnetic fields in massive stars is indispensable to understand the conditions controlling the presence of those fields and their implications for the stellar physical parameters and evolution .",
    "accurate studies of the age , environment , and kinematic characteristics of magnetic stars are also promising to give us new insights into the origin of the magnetic fields .",
    "while a number of early b - type stars were detected as magnetic already several decades back , the first magnetic field detection in an o - type star was achieved only 13 years ago , even though the existence of magnetic o - type stars had been suspected for a long time .",
    "indirect observational evidence for the presence of magnetic fields were the many unexplained phenomena observed in massive stars , which are thought to be related to magnetic fields , like cyclical wind variability , h@xmath0 emission variation , chemical peculiarity , narrow x - ray emission lines , and non - thermal radio / x - ray emission .",
    "however , direct measurements of the magnetic field strength in massive stars , using spectropolarimetry to determine the zeeman splitting of the spectral lines , are difficult , since only a few spectral lines are available for these measurements . in addition , these spectral lines are usually strongly broadened by rapid rotation and macroturbulence , and frequently appear in emission or display pcyg profiles . in high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations",
    ", broad spectral lines frequently extend over adjacent orders , so that it is necessary to adopt order shapes to get the best continuum normalization . furthermore , most of the existing high - resolution spectropolarimeters are operating at smaller telescopes , and can not deliver the necessary high signal - to - noise ( snr ) observations for a majority of the massive stars . especially o - type stars and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are rather faint .",
    "indeed , the bright star catalog contains only about 50 o - type stars and only very few wr stars .    in view of the large line",
    "broadening in massive stars , to search for the presence of magnetic fields , the low - resolution vlt instrument fors2  and prior to that fors1  appears to be the most suitable instrument in the world , offering the appropriate spectral resolution and the required spectropolarimetric sensitivity , giving access to massive stars even in galaxies in our neighborhood .",
    "only the faint object camera and spectrograph at the subaru telescope has an operating spectropolarimetric mode , and , pending the commissioning of the pepsi spectrograph in polarimetric mode installed at the large binocular telescope , no further high - resolution spectropolarimetric capabilities are available on any of the 810 m class telescopes .",
    "the first spectropolarimetric observations of o - type stars at eso started with fors1 already in 2005 . during a survey of thirteen o - type stars ,",
    "the discovery of the presence of a magnetic field was announced in the of?p star hd148937 @xcite .",
    "the class of of?p stars was introduced by walborn @xcite and includes only five stars in our galaxy .",
    "of?p stars display recurrent spectral variations in certain spectral lines , sharp emission or pcygni profiles in hei and the balmer lines , and strong ciii emission lines around 4650 . in the last years",
    ", it was shown that all of?p stars are magnetic with field strengths from a few hundred gauss to a few kg . among them , only two of?p stars , hd148937 and cpd@xmath1282561 are observable from paranal and , noteworthy , the first magnetic field detections were achieved through fors1 and fors2 observations @xcite .",
    "all fors1/2 observations of hd148937 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofp ] together with the espadons observations obtained at cfht @xcite .",
    "this figure demonstrates the excellent agreement between the fors2 and espadons measurements , highlighting the outstanding potential of fors2 for the detection of magnetic fields and the investigation of the magnetic field geometry in massive stars .",
    "notably , while an exposure time of 21.5h at the cfht was necessary to obtain seven binned measurements , the exposure time for the individual fors2 observations accounted only for two to four minutes and only 2.3h were used for the observations at six different epochs , including telescope presets and the usual overheads for readout time and retarder waveplate rotation .",
    "also the fors2 measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic field of the second of?p star , cpd@xmath1282561 , were consistent with a single - wave variation during the stellar rotation cycle , indicating a dominant dipolar contribution to the magnetic field topology with an estimated polar strength of the surface dipole b@xmath2 larger than 1.15 kg @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the studies of these two of?p stars , none of the reported detections reached a 4@xmath3 significance level .",
    "while 3@xmath3 detections with fors2 can not always be trusted for single observations , they are genuine if the measurements show smooth variations over the rotation period , similar to those found for the of?p stars hd148937 and cpd@xmath1282561 . the detection of rotational modulation of the longitudinal magnetic field is important to constrain the global field geometry necessary to support physical modeling of the spectroscopic and light variations .    to identify and to model the physical processes responsible for the generation of their magnetic fields , it is important to establish whether magnetic fields can also be detected in massive stars that are fast rotators and have runaway status .",
    "recent detections of strong magnetic fields in very fast rotating early - b type stars indicate that the spindown timescale via magnetic braking can be much longer than the estimated age of these targets ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , current studies of their kinematical status identified a number of magnetic o and of?p stars as candidate runaway stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) . increasing the known number of magnetic objects with extreme rotation , which are probably products of a past binary interaction , is important to understand the magnetic field origin in massive stars .",
    "the star @xmath4ophiuchi ( = hd149757 ) of spectral type o9.5v is a well - known rapidly rotating runaway star , rotating almost at break - up velocity with @xmath5kms@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the fors2 observations showed the presence of a weak magnetic field with a reversal of polarity @xcite and an amplitude of about 100 g .",
    "the resulting periodogram for the magnetic field measurements using all available lines showed a dominating peak corresponding to a period of about 1.3d , which is roughly double the period of 0.643d determined by pollmann @xcite , who studied the variation of the equivalent width of the he  i  6678 line .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields might change our whole picture about the evolution from o stars via wr stars to supernovae or gamma - ray bursts .",
    "neglecting magnetic fields could be one of the reasons why models and observations of massive - star populations are still in conflict .",
    "another potential importance of magnetic fields in massive stars concerns the dynamics of stellar winds .",
    "a few years ago , hubrig et al .  ( 2016 , _ submitted _ ) carried out fors2 observations of a sample of galactic wr stars including one wr star in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "magnetic fields in wr stars are especially hard to detect because of wind - broadening of their spectral lines .",
    "moreover , all photospheric lines are absent and the magnetic field is measured on emission lines formed in the strong wind .",
    "remarkably , spectropolarimetric monitoring of wr6 , one of the brightest wr stars , revealed a sinusoidal nature of @xmath7 variations with a period of 3.77d , with an amplitude of only 7090 g .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    recent high - precision uninterrupted high - cadence space photometry using a number of satellites ( e.g. , wire , most , corot , kepler , brite ) led to a revolutionary change in the observational evaluation of variability of massive stars . supported by results of photometric monitoring",
    ", it is expected that a large fraction of massive stars show photometric variability due to either @xmath11cep- or spb - like pulsations , or stochastic @xmath12-modes , or convectively - driven internal gravity waves .",
    "high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations of pulsating stars frequently fail to show credible measurement results , if the whole sequence of subexposures at different retarder waveplate angles has a duration comparable to the timescale of the pulsation variability . as an example , even for the bright fourth magnitude @xmath11  cephei star @xmath13cma with a pulsation period of 5h , a full harps sequence of subexposures requires about 30min .",
    "in contrast , one fors2 observation of the same star lasts less than 10min . owing to the strong changes in the line profile positions and the shapes in the spectra of pulsating stars , a method using spectra averaged over all subexposures leads to erroneous wavelength shifts and thus to wrong values for the longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "for the first time , fors1 magnetic field surveys of slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars and @xmath11cephei stars were carried out from 2003 to 2008 . as a number of pulsating stars showed the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "our observations implied that @xmath11  cephei and spb stars can no longer be considered as classes of non - magnetic pulsators .",
    "notably , although the presence of magnetic fields in these stars is already known for more than ten years , the effect of these fields on the oscillation properties is not yet understood and remains to be studied .",
    "@xmath13cma , discovered as magnetic with fors1 observations long ago , is still the record holder with the strongest mean longitudinal magnetic field among the @xmath11  cephei stars of the order of 300400 g @xcite . using fors2 measurements obtained in service mode in 2009/10 , hubrig et al .",
    "@xcite detected a rotational modulation of its magnetic field with a period of about 2.19d and estimated a magnetic dipole strength of about 5.3 kg .",
    "fully unexpected , observations of this particular star with the _ xmm - newton _ telescope revealed for the first time x - ray pulsations with the same period as the stellar radial pulsation @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : lida1 ] and [ fig : lida2 ] , we present the observed x - ray light curve and the x - ray / optical light curves phased with the pulsation period . this first discovery of x - ray pulsations from a non - degenerate , massive star , stimulates theoretical considerations for the physical processes operating in magnetized stellar winds .    observations of pulsating stars also allowed the first detection of a magnetic field in another @xmath11  cephei star , @xmath14  lup @xcite , which is an sb2 system and recently received attention due to the presence of a magnetic field in both components . since binary systems with magnetic components are rather rare , the detection of a magnetic field in this system using low resolution fors spectropolarimetry indicates the potential of fors2 also for magnetic field searches in binary or multiple systems .",
    "during the last years , the measurement strategy for high - resolution and low - resolution spectropolarimetric observations was modified in many aspects . to measure the mean longitudinal magnetic fields in high - resolution polarimetric spectra obtained with espadons , narval , and harps",
    "most teams are using the moment technique introduced by mathys @xcite and the least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) introduced by donati et al .",
    "@xcite . in the last years ,",
    "carroll et al .",
    "@xcite developed the multi - line singular value decomposition ( svd ) method for stokes profile reconstruction .",
    "the basic idea of svd is similar to the principal component analysis approach , where the similarity of the individual stokes @xmath15 profiles allows one to describe the most coherent and systematic features present in all spectral line profiles as a projection onto a small number of eigenprofiles ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the excellent potential of the svd method , especially in the analysis of extremely weak fields , e.g.  in the herbig ae / be star pds2 , was recently demonstrated by hubrig et al .",
    "( @xcite ; right side of their fig.4 ) .    in the reduction process of low - resolution spectropolarimetric observations ,",
    "hubrig et al .",
    "@xcite perform rectification of the @xmath16 spectra and calculate null profiles , @xmath17 , as pairwise differences from all available @xmath15 profiles . from these ,",
    "3@xmath3-outliers are identified and used to clip the @xmath15 profiles .",
    "this removes spurious signals , which mostly come from cosmic rays , and also reduces the noise .",
    "a full description of the updated data reduction and analysis will be presented in a paper by schller et al .",
    "( _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath7 , is defined by the slope of the weighted linear regression line through the measured data points , where the weight of each data point is given by the squared signal - to - noise ratio of the stokes @xmath15 spectrum .",
    "the formal @xmath18 error of @xmath7 is obtained from the standard relations for weighted linear regression .",
    "this error is inversely proportional to the rms signal - to - noise ratio of stokes @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we apply the factor @xmath19 to the error determined from the linear regression , if larger than 1 .    since 2014 , hubrig et al .  @xcite also implement the monte - carlo bootstrapping technique , where they typically generate @xmath20 statistical variations of the original dataset , and analyze the resulting distribution @xmath21 of the @xmath22 regression results . mean and standard deviation of this distribution are identified with the most likely mean longitudinal magnetic field and its @xmath18 error , respectively .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it provides an independent error estimate .",
    "a number of discrepancies in the published measurement accuracies has been reported by bagnulo et al .",
    "@xcite , who used the eso fors1 pipeline to reduce the full content of the fors1 archive .",
    "the same authors already published a few similar papers in the last years suggesting that very small instrument flexures , negligible in most of the instrument applications , may be responsible for some spurious magnetic field detections , and that fors detections may be considered reliable only at a level greater than 5@xmath3 .",
    "however , no report on the presence of flexures from any astronomer observing with the forses was ever published in the past .",
    "the authors also discuss the impact of seeing , if the exposure time is comparable with the atmospheric coherence time , which they incorrectly assume to be in seconds and not in milliseconds . in the most recent work do the authors present for the first time the level of intensity fluxes for each image and report which spectral regions were used for the magnetic field measurements . however , no fluxes for left - hand and right - hand polarized spectra are available , thus the reproduction of their measurements is not possible .",
    "notably , already small changes in the spectral regions selected for the measurements can have a significant impact on the measurement results @xcite .    and , the @xmath23  scuti star hd21190 , the nitrogen rich early b - type star hd52089 , and the herbig ae star pds2 .",

    "all these stars were announced in studies by hubrig et al .  as magnetic .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.0% ]    since the measurement accuracies predominantly depend on photon noise , an improper extraction of the spectra , for instance the use of smaller extraction windows , would explain why bagnulo et al .",
    "@xcite disregarded 3@xmath3 detections by other authors .",
    "indeed , the inspection of the levels of intensity fluxes for each subexposure compiled in the catalog of bagnulo et al .",
    "@xcite shows that their levels are frequently lower , down to 70% in comparison to those obtained in our studies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] , we present the comparison of fluxes for a few stars for which detections were achieved and published by hubrig et al .  during the last years .",
    "it is obvious that the detection of weak magnetic fields is especially affected if the extracted fluxes are low . from the consideration of the snr values presented by bagnulo et al .",
    "@xcite , we also noted that emission lines are not taken into account during the measurements .",
    "the reason for this is not clear to us , as there is no need to differentiate between absorption and emission lines : the used relation between the stokes @xmath15 signal and the slope of the spectral line wing holds for both type of lines , so that the signals of emission and absorption lines add up rather than cancel .",
    "to increase the reliability of magnetic field detections , but also to carry out a quantitative atmospheric analysis and to probe spectral variability , it is certainly helpful to follow up fors2 detections with high - resolution harps observations . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only collaboration that uses fors2 and harps to monitor magnetic fields is the bob ( `` b - fields in ob stars '' ) collaboration @xcite , which is focused on the search of magnetic fields in massive stars . combining observations with different instruments",
    "allowed the bob collaboration to report during the last couple of years the presence of magnetic fields in a number of massive stars .",
    "as an example , the first detection of a magnetic field in the single slowly rotating o9.7v star hd54879 was achieved with fors2 and follow - up harps observations could show that hd54879 is , so far , the strongest magnetic single o - type star detected with a stable and normal optical spectrum @xcite ."
