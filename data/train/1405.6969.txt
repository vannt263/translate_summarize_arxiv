    "multiphase flows represent the cornerstone of many fields of science and technology ranging from micro - scale devices to the large scale cyclonic separators of industrial plants . in the context of micro / nano technologies ,",
    "the transport of small particles or bubbles by a carrier fluid is fundamental in designing micro - devices where particles must be separated , mixed or advected towards the sensible regions of the apparatus for detection purposes , see e.g @xcite .",
    "concerning larger scale devices , the turbulent transport of a disperse phase is relevant for the dynamics of small fuel droplets in combustion chambers , @xcite , or in the spatial evolution of sprays employed for surface coating , @xcite .",
    "important aspects of multiphase flows are related to the intrinsic coupling between the motion of the disperse phase and the carrier fluid which involves mass , momentum and energy exchange between the two phases .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions among the particles or inter - particles collisions might also occur .",
    "the regime where all these interactions take place is known as four - way coupling regime , see e.g. @xcite . the straightforward method to capture such complex physics",
    "is represented by numerical simulations where the fluid flow around each particle is fully resolved .",
    "this means that the actual particle boundary has to be resolved on the computational grid and the coupling with the fluid occurs via the non slip boundary conditions imposed on the particle surface .",
    "the hydrodynamic force on each particle can be directly computed by integrating the pressure and shear stress distribution on the boundary . even though this approach captures entirely the physics , it is computationally demanding and limited to the simulation of a relatively small number of `` large '' particles .",
    "the adjective large means that the particle typical size , the diameter @xmath0 , is larger than the smallest physically active hydrodynamical scale @xmath1 .",
    "for instance @xmath1 could be either the kolmogorov dissipative scale in a turbulent flow or the smallest spatial scale in a micro - fluidic apparatus . in the context of",
    "the so called resolved particles simulations many approaches are available ranging from finite volume techniques , @xcite , immersed boundary methods , @xcite , or approaches based on the lattice - boltzman equations , @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches are however available . for instance , the physalis technique , see e.g. @xcite and references therein , has been recently adopted to address the interaction of solid particle and a turbulent flow , @xcite .",
    "@xcite adapted the pseudo - penalization spectral method proposed by @xcite to account for the coupled dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles in a turbulent flow . the force coupling method ( fcm )",
    "proposed by maxey and coworkers , see e.g. among many others the papers by @xcite , is certainly worth mentioning in detail . in the fcm",
    "the effect that each particle exerts on the fluid is approximated by a multipole expansion of a regularized steady stokes solution where the concentrated delta - function forces are mollified to a gaussian .",
    "the basic method has been continuously improved by including several physical effects such as lubrication forces for closely packed particles @xcite or the effects of elongated particles @xcite . recently a numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence laden with thousands of relatively large particles @xmath2 has been reported by @xcite .",
    "the opposite limit of particles much smaller than the smallest hydrodynamical scale is also relevant in many applications .",
    "for instance the mixing and combustion of a turbulent spray after that the primary atomization phase has occurred , takes place in presence of significant momentum coupling among the carrier fluid and the fuel droplets , see e.g. the recent review by @xcite .",
    "in fact , in dilute suspensions the volume fraction of the particles is small enough to neglect hydrodynamic interactions and collisions among particles .",
    "however , for large values of the particle - to - fluid density ratio , significant mass loads ( ratio between the mass of the disperse phase and the fluid ) may occur .",
    "in such regime , the so called the two - way coupling regime , the momentum exchange between the two phases is significant and must be accounted for .",
    "the particle in cell ( pic ) method , @xcite , is still a valuable tool to model the momentum coupling .",
    "such approach needs substantial care , however , due to technical issues associated with the injection of the point - wise forcing of the particles on the computational grid where the continuous fluid phase is resolved .",
    "indeed , the force that the particles exert on the fluid is regularized by averaging on the volume of the computational cell .",
    "hence , the coupling term results strongly grid dependent unless the number of particles per cell @xmath3 exceeds a certain threshold , see e.g. the numerical results in @xcite , the discussion by @xcite and the comments in @xcite .",
    "alternative to the pic approach , other methods which are able to work irrespective of particle number density do indeed exist .",
    "for instance @xcite modeled the disturbance flow produced by each point particle in terms of the steady stokeslet .",
    "though interesting , this approach has several potential shortcomings .",
    "the disturbance flow decays in space away from the particle as slow as the inverse distance and the perturbation induced by a single particle affects the whole domain . in these conditions ,",
    "any truncation is undoubtably bound to deeply alter the dynamics .",
    "additionally , the disturbance flow presents the singularity associated with the steady stokeslet .",
    "moreover , the steady stokes solution used to model the fluid - particle interaction is not uniformly valid and fails away from the particle .",
    "the oseen correction consistently accounts for the unavoidable far field convective effects , see classical textbooks like @xcite .",
    "numerical approaches based on this improved modeling can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a new approach able to provide a physically consistent and numerically convergent solution for the flow disturbance produced by a huge number of small , massive particles coupled to a generic , possibly turbulent , carrier flow . hereafter",
    "this new formulation will be referred to as the exact regularized point particle ( erpp ) method . as it will be shown in detail",
    ", this approach presents several advantages .",
    "the most significant one is related to the physical accuracy of the momentum coupling modeling . in a nutshell , in the relative motion with respect to the fluid",
    ", the particle generates a vortical field .",
    "even though the relative reynolds number is small , the local flow is dominated by unsteady viscous effects as discussed by @xcite .",
    "vorticity production is a localized process that takes a finite elapsed time @xmath4 since generation to reach the relevant hydrodynamic scales of the flow .",
    "it is indeed this transient process of localized generation and finite time diffusion that introduces the actual momentum coupling with the carrier flow .",
    "indeed , the model here envisaged reproduces this physical process by addressing the velocity field , rather than vorticity .",
    "the finite time delay @xmath4 automatically provides the regularization of the disturbance field . instead of being a purely mathematical or numerical ingredient ,",
    "the regularization featured by erpp is intrinsically associated with the actual physical process of vorticity generation and viscous diffusion .",
    "a distinguishing aspect of erpp is that all the vorticity generated by the particle is properly transferred to the fluid phase , entailing momentum conservation .",
    "a crucial concern is the small scale component of the disturbance field associated with the instantaneously generated vorticity not yet diffused up - to the hydrodynamic scales .",
    "this localized , inner scale part of the disturbance exhibits a @xmath5 local singularity and vanishes altogether at the relevant hydrodynamic scales .",
    "although , in principle , this field should contribute locally to the convective term of the navier - stokes equations , its effect is proportional to the ( small ) particle reynolds number based on the slip velocity .",
    "consistently , it negligibly contributes to the dynamics of the relevant hydrodynamic scales .",
    "concerning the hydrodynamic force acting on the particles in the two way - coupling regime , the expression provided by @xcite is easily adapted to the present context .",
    "a crucial issue is the fluid - to - particle slip velocity appearing in the expression of the stokes drag that should be understood as the undisturbed fluid velocity ( i.e. the relative fluid - particle velocity in absence of the particle ) . in the erpp the self - induced velocity disturbance can be evaluated in a closed form , allowing to explicitly remove its contribution .",
    "it follows a consistent evaluation of slip velocity and hydrodynamic force .    despite the underlying theoretical aspects",
    "may look complicated at first sight , the practical implementation of the ensuing algorithm is remarkably simple and efficient . in principle",
    ", the coupling algorithm can indeed be embedded in any available discretization scheme as implemented in one s favorite navier - stokes solver .",
    "this flexibility allows to easily handle hundred thousands particles at affordable computational cost .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section  [ sec : methodology ] forms the main theoretical body of the paper .",
    "along with its subsections , it introduces the physical model and discusses the inter - phase momentum coupling . in section  [ sec : validation ] the proposed approach is validated against available analytical results . section  [ sec : turb_flow ] reports preliminary results concerning a turbulent particle - laden shear flow . finally , the last section  [ sec : final ] summarizes the main findings . to smooth out the reading , several appendices are devoted to lengthy technical issues",
    "whose description inside the main text would have hampered a clear exposition of the main material .",
    "in this section we present the physical model used to achieve the momentum coupling between the carrier fluid and the disperse phase in view of describing the algorithm for the simulation of particle laden flows in the two way coupling regime . in doing so",
    ", we assume to know the state of the system at time @xmath6 and propagate the solution for one time step @xmath7 .",
    "clearly , reiteration of the procedure allows to proceed in time , as in standard time integration algorithms . during the generic time step of length @xmath8",
    "the state of the system will propagate from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "hereafter we shall often address the generic step as the step @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the running time will be @xmath12 in all the differential equations to be addressed . in the discussion ,",
    "a quantity @xmath4 with dimension of time and the role of a regularization parameter will play a central role . in this case , having dubbed the current time as instant @xmath13 , it could well happen that certain time - delayed variables ( i.e. @xmath14 ) could be negative : we like to assure the reader before hand that this will be no harm .",
    "integral representation of the solution may represent an exception to this rule .",
    "indeed , such integral representation will be used to derive a systematic regularization procedure from which we obtain by differentiation the regularized pde s to be solved in the algorithm . in such cases",
    "the time extrema will typically range in the interval @xmath15 $ ] , with @xmath6 arbitrary , and typically larger than @xmath4 .    in this framework ,",
    "the short time evolution ( @xmath16 ) of the overall flow ( fluid and particles ) is conceptually split into a ( modified ) navier - stokes evolution of the carrier fluid and a superimposed disturbance flow produced by the relative motion of the particles , here assumed spherical , with respect to the fluid .",
    "relying on the small reynolds number of the particle - fluid relative motion , the disturbance flow is described by the linear unsteady stokes equations .",
    "in fact , we will rearrange the equation in such a way that the exact solution of the particle disturbance field is consistently embedded into the carrier phase navier - stokes solver allowing to reconstruct the actual fluid - particle coupled solution in the limit of vanishing time step and grid spacing for small particle reynolds number .",
    "the detailed derivation of the coupling model needs a gradual illustration better achieved starting from a schematic description divided in five conceptual steps :    * carrier flow - disperse phase interaction and disturbance flow equation ( subsection  [ sec : interaction ] ) * solution of the disturbance flow equation ( subsection  [ sec : disturbance ] ) * regularization ( subsection  [ sec : sing_reg ] ) * embedding the disturbance flow into the navier - stokes equations ( subsection  [ sec : coupling_phases ] ) * evaluation of the hydrodynamic force on the particles in the two - way coupling regime and removal of the self - induced velocity disturbance ( subsection  [ sec : prtcl_motion_force ] ) .      in presence of a disperse phase",

    "the equations of rigid body dynamics need be coupled to the equation for the fluid velocity field to determine the particle motions , where the fluid tension acting at the particle boundary provide the relevant forces and moments .    in principle",
    "the system ( [ eqn : ns_resolved ] ) can be numerically integrated at the price of resolving all the particle boundaries on the computational grid .",
    "when the suspension is formed by a huge number of small particles their direct solution is unaffordable . in any case ,",

    "other choices are possible , but the actual shape of the field inside the particle domains is irrelevant to our present purposes : under this respect , the solid body motion provides an elegant example given the continuity of the field @xmath46 at the particle boundaries . in problem ( [ eqn : ns_background ] ) , a part from the prolongation of the field @xmath46 , the particles disappeared altogether from the domain and the convective term , retaining its complete nonlinear nature in the fluid domain , is treated as a prescribed forcing term .",

    "the field @xmath51 can be regarded as a free space solution in the whole @xmath52 restricted the actual flow domain @xmath18 .",
    "indeed the value of @xmath51 at the domain boundary is used to correct the boundary condition for @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth calling the reader s attention to the initial conditions for the two complementary problems : the initial velocity field is assigned as initial condition for @xmath49 , leaving homogenous initial data for @xmath51 . as shown in a later section , the homogeneous initial conditions for the perturbation field @xmath51 will turn out to be a crucial feature of the decomposition .    the solution of equations ( [ eqn : unsteady_stokes ] ) can be expressed in terms of the boundary integral representation of the unsteady stokes equations that involves the unsteady stokeslet @xmath53 , a second order cartesian tensor , and the associated stresses in the form of the third order tensor @xmath54 , see appendix [ app : unsteady_stokeslet ] and classical textbooks , @xcite .",
    "the unsteady stokeslet @xmath53 is readily interpreted as the fluid velocity ( @xmath55th direction ) at position @xmath56 and time @xmath6 due to the singular forcing @xmath57 ( @xmath58th direction ) applied at @xmath59 at time @xmath60 . exploiting the vanishing initial condition ,",

    "the convective effect of the singular field will be dealt with in more detail , to show that it is indeed negligible when the dynamics is observed at the relevant hydrodynamical scale .      the regularized fluid velocity of the carrier flow in presence of the perturbing particles is obtained by aggregating the two contributions of the velocity decomposition @xmath133 described in subsection  [ sec : interaction ] .",

    "finally , the forcing term is grid independent in the sense that , once the grid spacing is refined ( @xmath147 progressively getting smaller at fixed @xmath111 ) , any successively finer grid will only provide a better numerical approximation of the same forcing .",
    "the dynamics of a point particle of mass @xmath148 in the relative motion with respect to a newtonian fluid is described by the equation of motion , @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the displaced mass of fluid , @xmath151 is the hydrodynamic force , and @xmath152 the acceleration due to gravity . clearly , for the accurate evaluation of the particle trajectories and of the inter - phase momentum coupling , an accurate and efficient expression for the hydrodynamic force is mandatory . to obtain such expression",
