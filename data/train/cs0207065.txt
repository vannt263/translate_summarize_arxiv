    "@xcite is at once the most popular and the most controversial non - monotonic formalism dealing with uncertain information .",
    "popular , because knowledge can be represented in a natural way in default logic .",
    "controversial , because the concept of an extension as presented by reiter is quite complex .",
    "since default logic has been presented  @xcite a lot of effort took place to establish relationships between default logic and other non - monotonic formalisms , such as _ autoepistemic logic _",
    "@xcite and _ circumscription _  @xcite .",
    "poole  @xcite ( _ theorist _ ) was  to our knowledge  the first one who tried to embed reiter s default logic in an _ assumption - based framework _",
    "it turned out that his proposition derives more extensions than the original default theory allows .",
    "the transformation proposed by ben - eliyahu & dechter  @xcite ( _ meta - interpretations _ ) results in a one - to - one correspondence of the original default theory and the their constructed propositional theory , but their transformation is in general is np - complete . another quasi - transformation proposed by bondarenko et al .",
    "@xcite ( _ abstract argumentation - theoretic approach _ ) lacks a procedure to compute the extensions of the specified default theory . in conclusion ,",
    "the transformations mentioned so far have their weaknesses .",
    "that is the main reason , why we searched for a translation of propositional default theories into an assumption - based framework , called _ argumentation systems _",
    "@xcite , to overcome the weaknesses encountered so far .    in argumentation systems",
    "all inference is done without leaving the field of classical propositional logic .",
    "informally speaking , argumentation systems allow to judge open questions ( hypotheses ) about the unknown or future world in the light of the given knowledge .",
    "the problem is to determine a set of possible assumptions that allows to deduce the hypothesis from the given knowledge .",
    "note that the concept of argumentation systems has many different meanings and we refer to @xcite for an overview .",
    "for instance , the _ argumentation framework _ proposed by prakken  @xcite , which uses the same terminology as in bondarenko et al .",
    "@xcite , is a derivation of nute s  @xcite _ defeasible logic_. so , prakken s proposal has only the term _ argumentation _ with our approach in common and it is not an assumption - based framework .",
    "therefore , we do not make a comparison between prakken s  @xcite and our approach .",
    "but it is worth noting that prakken s proposal is close to lukasiewicz s",
    "@xcite approach which extends still another derivation of nute s defeasible logic with probabilities .",
    "lukasiewicz proposal in turn has similar properties as the framework proposed by benferhat et al .",
    "however , in this paper the notion of an argumentation system is defined in section  [ sec05 ] .    in this paper , we present a transformation of reiter s default logic into the framework of argumentation systems .",
    "this transformation is linear in the number of defaults and allows us to establish a bijection between extensions of the default theory and some subsets of assumptions of the argumentation system .",
    "moreover , we provide procedures to answer any query on the specified default theory .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec012 ] repeats the necessary basic notions of propositional logic as a remainder . in section  [ sec03 ]",
    "we briefly present reiter s default logic and introduce the transformation of propositional default theories into associated propositional argumentation systems .",
    "section  [ sec04 ] discusses the basic elements of propositional argumentation systems . in section  [ sec05 ]",
    "we present the new results obtained using the transformation mentioned .",
    "we conclude with an outlook in sections  [ sec06 ] .",
    "proofs of the new theorems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of propositional logic .",
