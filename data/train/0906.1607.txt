    "what determines the mass of a newborn star ?",
    "our knowledge on this fundamental question in astrophysics is still limited .",
    "observationally , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a power law with the salpeter slope @xmath8 on the high - mass side and becomes flatter below a break at @xmath9 on the lower - mass side . towards even lower mass ( @xmath10 )",
    ", the number of stars appears to decline ( e.g. , muench et al .",
    "that is , the characteristic mass in the solar neighborhood is @xmath11 .",
    "recently , the mass distribution of dense cores in a star - forming region was found to have a similar shape to the stellar imf , with a mass offset about a factor of three ( alves et al .",
    "also , the typical mass of the cores @xmath12 is approximately the jeans mass @xmath13 : @xmath14 where we used the typical number density @xmath15 and temperature of the cores @xmath16  k. these facts indicate that the characteristic stellar mass is set already at the formation stage of dense cores through gravitational fragmentation .",
    "the factor of three reduction of the stellar mass from the core mass can be a result of some stellar feedback , e.g. , protostellar outflows , which reduce the amount of material in the core , or binary / multiple formation .",
    "theoretical estimations support such an efficiency for the low - mass cores ( e.g. , matzner & mckee 2000 ) .",
    "even though the characteristic stellar mass is determined by the gravitational ( or turbulent ) fragmentation process , formation of the most massive stars will be limited by the feedback from the protostar , as inferred from the following consideration .",
    "a small protostar , which forms at the center of the core subsequent to its gravitational collapse , grows in mass by accretion from the leftover core material , i.e. , envelope .",
    "since a massive protostar becomes so luminous during accretion , radiation pressure on dust grains easily disrupts the accretion envelope ( larson & starrfield 1971 ; kahn 1974 ; wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) . under a typical accretion rate ,",
    "i.e. , a jeans mass @xmath13 of gas falling on the protostar in a free - fall time @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sound speed in the natal core and @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , the upper mass limit by radiative pressure falls on about @xmath21 .",
    "although rare , stars more massive than this limit do exist in the milky way .",
    "how such stars formed is still debated .",
    "accretion through a circumstellar disk can somewhat alleviate the radiative feedback .",
    "besides , it appears that massive star formation requires a non - standard environment .",
    "for example , faster accretion than the standard or stellar mergers are sometimes invoked .",
    "in fact , observations tell us that accretion rates on massive protostars are quite high , @xmath22 ( e.g. , zhang et al . 2005 ; keto & wood 2006 ; grave & kumar 2009 ) , and the natal dense cores are unusually massive @xmath23 ( e.g. , saito et al . 2006",
    "; motte et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , as a guide , the upper mass limit within the standard accretion scenario is still important .",
    "metallicity governs the thermal balance in prestellar cores , thereby affecting the core temperature and the protostellar accretion rate through equation ( [ eq : mdot_sol ] ) .",
    "the accretion rate in turn alters the protostellar evolution .",
    "metals also act as catalysts in the cn cycle , modifying the stellar structure .",
    "in addition , lowering the dust opacity is expected to reduce the strength of the radiative feedback . as a first step , we here aim to calculate the evolution of accreting protostars and evaluate the mass limit where the accretion is prohibited by the stellar radiative feedback as a function of metallicity under the standard accretion rates and spherical symmetry .",
    "we consider the effects of radiation pressure exerted on the accretion envelope , as well as expansion of an h  ii region .",

[ eq : mdot_sol ] ) , which depends on metallicity .",
    "the temperature evolution during the prestellar collapse for various metallicities has been studied by omukai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) by using a one - zone model with detailed chemical and radiative processes .",
    "the prestellar core is assumed to undergo run - away collapse , i.e. , its central flat part has a radius about the jeans length and the central density increases at a free - fall timescale .",
    "note that its radius and mass generally decreases with increasing density and thus most of the material originally in the core is left behind after some moment .",

    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : thev_mdotz ] shows those accretion rates .",
    "the higher accretion rates at lower metallicities reflect the higher temperatures in the envelopes .    here",
    ", we have adopted the standard accretion rate @xmath48 .",
    "however , the accretion rate can vary according to the way of prestellar collapse .",
    "for example , in a dynamical runaway collapse , the larson - penston ( lp ) solution , the accretion rate reaches as high as @xmath49 , while the standard rate is almost exact for the static collapse of the singular isothermal sphere , the shu solution . in realistic hydrodynamical calculations ,",
    "the prestellar collapse asymptotically approaches the lp solution .",
    "the accretion rate is initially as high as @xmath50 times the standard rate and decreases gradually until it reaches the standard rate ( e.g. , larson 2003 ) . to accommodate possible such variations",
    ", we also examine the evolution with the accretion rate ten times higher than the standard value .",
    "next , we calculate the protostellar evolution with the derived accretion rates at each metallicity",
    ". stellar feedback effects , which possibly alter the accretion rates , are separately examined in   [ ssec : fdbk ] with the calculated evolution .",
    "details of our numerical method are summarized in our previous papers ( e.g. , hosokawa & omukai 2009 and references therein ) .",

    "dust grains in the accretion envelope evaporate at a dust destruction front , where their temperature reaches about 2000  k. the envelope is divided into inner gas envelope and outer dust cocoon , whose boundary is the dust destruction front .",
    "we numerically solve the structure of an accreting protostar and gas envelope .",
    "the basic equations for the protostar are the stellar structure equations with mass accretion ( e.g. , stahler , shu & taam 1980 , palla & stahler 1991 ) .",
    "we adopt the free - fall flow for the optically thin gas envelope .",
    "when the flow becomes opaque before reaching the stellar surface , we solve the structure of the opaque part , called a radiative precursor .",
    "the flow finally hits the stellar surface and forms an accretion shock front .",
    "the whole structure of the protostar and gas envelope is consistently determined to satisfy the shock jump conditions .",
    "an evolutionary calculation begins with a small initial protostar constructed according to stahler , shu & taam ( 1980 ) .",
    "we construct sequence of models with increasing stellar mass by accretion , until the protostar reaches the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) stage .",
    "nuclear burning reactions of deuterium , hydrogen , and helium are included in our calculations .",

    "figure [ fig : m_r_fid_10times ] presents the calculated protostellar evolution at each metallicity .",
    "the evolution at @xmath3 agrees with previous calculations by omukai & palla ( 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "there are four evolutionary stages with the fiducial accretion rates ( upper panel ) : ( i ) adiabatic accretion ( @xmath52 ) , ( ii ) swelling ( @xmath53 ) , ( iii ) kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) contraction ( @xmath54 ) , and ( iv ) accretion to zams star ( @xmath55 ) . a key quantity to understand varieties of the evolution is a ratio between two timescales : the accretion timescale , @xmath56 and the kh timescale , @xmath57 the two timescales @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be regarded as evolutionary and thermal - adjustment timescales of the protostar .",
    "the protostar gains materials with high entropy generated at the accretion shock front on @xmath58 .",
    "meanwhile , radiation diffuses outward and reduce the stellar entropy on @xmath59 . in the early phase , @xmath58 is much shorter than @xmath59 .",
    "the entropy taken into the star adiabatically accumulates in the stellar interior ( adiabatic accretion ) .",
    "this stage is over because @xmath59 decreases ( @xmath39 increases ) as the stellar mass increases .",
    "as @xmath59 approaches @xmath58 , the interior entropy is gradually transferred outward by radiation .",
    "a part of transferred entropy is received by the outer layer near the stellar surface .",
    "this causes the swelling of the star .",
    "finally , @xmath58 becomes longer than @xmath59 .",
    "the star loses energy by radiation , and contracts hydrostatically ( kh contraction ) .",
    "the central temperature increases with the kh contraction .",
    "when hydrogen burning is ignited , the protostar reaches the zams stage .",
    "the above four evolutionary stages can be applied for other @xmath60 cases .",
    "the protostellar radius gradually increases in the early stage and then experiences the swelling .",
    "the protostar contracts in the next stage and finally arrives at the zams . in all cases , the timescale balance switches from @xmath61 to @xmath62 at the swelling",
    "however , figure [ fig : m_r_fid_10times ] also presents some different aspects of the evolution with different metallicities .",
    "the following three evolutionary tendencies result from the lower accretion rates at higher metallicities ( see also hosokawa & omukai 2009 ) .",
    "\\(i ) the protostellar radius is larger for lower metallicity .",
    "for @xmath3 , the radius exceeds @xmath63 at @xmath3 , while only a few @xmath64 for @xmath1 .",
    "this reflects higher entropy content in the star for higher accretion rate ( see e.g. , hosokawa & omukai 2009 ) as the radius is related with entropy @xmath65 by @xmath66.\\ ] ] without enough time after the shock for accreted matter to cool radiatively before burying into opaque interior , the interior entropy is higher for higher accretion rate .",
    "( ii ) the protostellar mass is higher at the onset of zams phase for lower metallicity .",
    "the star arrives on the zams at @xmath67 for @xmath3 , and at a few @xmath68 for @xmath1 ( also see fig.[fig : tau_fid ] ) .",
    "since the stellar radius is larger for lower metallicity ( e.g. , lower accretion rate ) , the interior temperature is higher according to the relation , @xmath69 thus , higher @xmath70 is needed for ignition of hydrogen burning at @xmath71  k. ( iii ) signatures of deuterium burning appear only at metallicity @xmath72 . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the protostar becomes almost fully convective by deuterium burning at @xmath73 .",
    "the linear increase of the radius at @xmath74 is due to this effect .",
    "after that , the star gradually returns to be radiative by the swelling at @xmath75 .",
    "this is in contrast to the metal - poor cases . at @xmath3 ,",
    "deuterium burning begins later at @xmath5 and hardly affects the evolution .",
    "the protostar remains radiative until its arrival to the zams .",
    "these variations are also due to different evolution of the stellar inner temperature following equation ( [ eq : t_typ ] )",
    ".    apart from different accretion rates , metallicity still influences the protostellar evolution .",
    "for example , the accreting ms star has smaller radius at the lower metallicity .",
    "this is due to different initial abundances of c and n atoms .",
    "massive ms stars is supported against gravity with hydrogen burning via cn - cycle reactions . with lower cn abundance",
    ", higher temperature is required to supply enough to support the star , thus leading to smaller ms radius .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : m_r_fid_10times ] shows the protostellar evolution with accretion rate ten times higher than the fiducial value .",
    "the mass - radius relation varies with metallicity in the same manner as in the fiducial cases . compared to the fiducial case at the same metallicity , a protostar has larger radius and arrives to the zams at higher stellar mass , which is consistent with the dependence on accretion rates discussed above .",
    "clear differences are found only for @xmath3 and @xmath76 .",
    "the protostar turns to inflate during the kh contraction in these cases .",
    "we separately focus on these cases in ",

    "the cocoon is optically thick if @xmath80 , which is indicated by the dotted background.,width=336 ]      protostellar luminosity increases with growth of the star by accretion .",
    "radiative feedback effects will eventually terminate the accretion .",
    "below we examine the effects of radiation pressure exerted on a radiative precursor and dust cocoon , as well as of the expansion of an h  ii region .",
    "our calculations have already included radiation pressure on the radiative precursor .",
    "we examine the other effects by separate analytic treatments and evaluate when these effects limit the accretion as a function of metallicity .",
    "a protostar growing with very high accretion rate exerts strong radiation pressure on a radiative precursor , which is a optically thick part of the gas envelope .",
    "this effect is found in the calculated protostellar evolution with @xmath81 for @xmath82 ( the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m_r_fid_10times ] ) . in these cases , at @xmath83 the kh contraction turns to the abrupt expansion ( also see omukai & palla 2003 ) .",
    "the expansion occurs because radiation pressure decelerates the accreting flow before reaching the stellar surface . the stellar surface pressure ,",
    "which balances the ram pressure by the flow , becomes too low to maintain the hydrostatic structure of the star .",
    "the expansion occurs when the total stellar luminosity @xmath84 approaches the eddington limit @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the thomson scattering opacity .",
    "although the luminosity from stellar interior @xmath87 remains below the eddington limit , the total luminosity @xmath84 from the protostar has an extra contribution from the accretion shock : @xmath88 note that the internal to accretion luminosity ratio @xmath89 is equal to the timescale ratio @xmath90 . since @xmath91 , @xmath92 becomes very high and @xmath84 reaches the eddington limit for a high enough value of @xmath93 during the kh contraction , where the radius approaches the zams value .",
    "this happens for the accretion rate exceeding the critical value @xmath94 for the case of @xmath95 and depending on metallicity only weakly ( omukai & palla 2003 ; hosokawa & omukai 2009 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case for @xmath82 with @xmath81 . in such cases",
    ", the protostars can not keep accreting at its original rate after the abrupt expansion . if the accretion terminates at this moment , the final stellar mass will be @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_10times ] ) .",
    "we here estimate the effect of radiation pressure on the dust cocoon .",
    "first , we consider how the radiation propagates outward in the accretion envelope .",
    "most of the stellar radiation is initially emitted in uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "the stellar radiation travels freely between the photosphere and dust destruction front .",
    "subsequent outward propagation in the dust cocoon depends on whether the cocoon is optically thick or thin for the stellar uv / optical light .",
    "if the cocoon is optically thick , most of the direct light is absorbed near the dust destruction front and is re - emitted in infrared wavelengths , then propagates outward diffusively .",
    "this is the case for the present - day protostars still embedded in their natal dense cores , which are observed as bright infrared sources . with lower abundance of dust grains ,",
    "however , the cocoon becomes transparent even for the stellar uv / optical light . in this case , the direct stellar light escapes from the cocoon without absorption and re - emission .",
    "figure [ fig : env_struct_schem ] schematically shows the structure of the flow for these two cases .",
    "the optical depth of the cocoon is roughly estimated as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is dust opacity for optical and uv light , and the suffix `` d '' denotes physical quantities at the dust destruction front .",
    "we regard the cocoon as optically thin ( thick ) if @xmath99 @xmath100 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath79 can be evaluated as follows .",
    "the position of the dust destruction front is @xmath101 ( wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : env_struct ] shows evolution of the dust destruction front at @xmath102 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 for the fiducial accretion rates .",
    "the front moves outward with increasing stellar mass as the total luminosity @xmath84 increases .",
    "we adopt a typical dust opacity in the optical range ( e.g. , mckee & ostriker 2007 ) , @xmath103 for a free - falling flow , the density at @xmath104 is @xmath105 we derive @xmath106 by substituting equations ( [ eq : rd ] ) and ( [ eq : rhod ] ) into ( [ eq : tauc ] ) .",
    "hence the optical depth decreases with the increase of stellar mass and luminosity .",
    "even if the cocoon is initially optically thick , it becomes optically thin at some moment in the evolution .",
    "evolution of the optical depth shown in lower panel of figure [ fig : env_struct ] demonstrates this transition . at @xmath107 , for example , the cocoon becomes transparent for the direct light at @xmath108 .",
    "note that the optical depth @xmath109 does not linearly scale with @xmath110 , owing to another dependence on @xmath93 .",
    "figures [ fig : tau_fid ] and [ fig : tau_10times ] summarize the evolution of the dust cocoon for all cases .",
    "next , we consider the condition for the flow to overcome the radiation pressure for cases where the cocoon is optically thick or thin , respectively . in the optically thick case ,",
    "most of the direct radiation is absorbed in a thin layer near the dust destruction front and isotropically re - emitted subsequently in infrared wavelengths .",
    "hence the absorbing layer receives outward momentum flux of @xmath111 . for the accretion to proceed ,",
    "the inward momentum flux of the flow must exceed this outward flux ( wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the free - fall infall velocity , @xmath114 using the continuity equation @xmath115 , equation ( [ eq : pram ] ) leads to a condition for accretion rates , @xmath116 additionally , the flow in the cocoon must overcome the radiation pressure by the infrared re - emission",
    ". this condition can be stated as that the stellar total luminosity be less than the eddington limit defined with dust opacity for infrared light @xmath117 : @xmath118 otherwise , radiation pressure decelerates the accretion flow before reaching the dust destruction front .",

    "we adopt the rosseland mean opacity at this maximum as the infrared opacity @xmath120 on the other hand , for an optically thin cocoon , the stellar radiation is not converted to infrared radiation by absorption and re - emission .",

    "figures [ fig : tau_fid ] and [ fig : tau_10times ] show that these limits are reached after the protostar arrives at the zams .",
    "for very high feedback limits , accreting stars might end their lives before reaching such limits .",
    "the maximum mass of the star can gain in its lifetime is roughly given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the lifetime of a zams star of @xmath160 .",
    "this limit is also presented in figures [ fig : tau_fid ] and [ fig : tau_10times ] . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath159 of primordial stars from marigo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for @xmath161 and from schaerer ( 2002 ) for @xmath162 , as their dependence on metallicity is weak .",
    "we see that the limit by the lifetime is less stringent than those by the radiative feedback effects .",
    "hence the final stellar mass will be set by the feedback effects , as long as the prestellar core is massive enough .",
    "the mass limit derive above is reached only in the case that the mass reservoir , i.e. , the mass of the natal core , is sufficient . here",
    ", we discuss the characteristic mass of the prestellar cores and compare them with the mass limits by the feedback .",
    "the cores are formed as a result of fragmentation of a more massive cloud . according to analytical ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ; larson 2005 ) and numerical ( bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ; jappsen et al . 2005",
    "; clark , glover & klessen 2008 ; smith et al .",
    "2009 ) arguments , fragmentations likely occur around temperature minima of thermal evolution tracks ( see figure [ fig : thev_mdotz ] ) , and cores of about the jeans mass @xmath13 are produced .",
    "this figure shows that the tracks at @xmath163 experiences two local temperature minima , i.e. , one at lower density @xmath164 , where @xmath165 , and the other at higher density @xmath166 , where @xmath167 .",
    "the former is induced by the line cooling , i.e , cooling by the h@xmath168 lines for @xmath169 , and the metal fine - structure lines for higher metallicity , while the latter is by the dust cooling . in clouds with extremely low - metallicity ,",
    "dust - induced minimum disappears , thus only high - mass fragmentation is allowed . on the other hand , at @xmath170 , two minima almost merges and result in a single characteristic mass - scale .",
    "the typical core mass in the cases with two fragmentation epochs is not clear yet .",
    "we speculate that massive and small cores corresponding to two fragmentation epochs exist simultaneously , and their number ratio depends on the efficiency of dust - induced fragmentation .",
    "those characteristic core mass - scales are also shown in figure [ fig : tau_fid ] and [ fig : tau_10times ] for comparison with the stellar mass limits by the feedback .",
    "the characteristic core masses by the dust - induced fragmentation is much smaller than the stellar mass limits . in such cores ,",
    "the final stellar masses are bounded by the amount of mass reservoir rather than the stellar feedback . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical core masses by the line - induced fragmentation are comparable to the mass limit by the radiative effects . in such massive prestellar cores , therefore , the final stellar masses should be limited by the radiative effects and very massive stars can be formed in low - metallicity environments .",
    "we studied protostellar evolution as a function of the metallicity , using the results to evaluate the significance of radiative feedback effects . for metallicities between zero and solar",
    ", we showed how the feedback terminates the mass accretion and determines the final stellar mass .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    first , we estimated accretion rates onto a protostar from the thermal evolution of a prestellar core at each metallicity .",
    "the accretion rates are higher at the lower metallicity , ranging from @xmath171 at @xmath95 to @xmath172 at @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the core temperature is higher at the lower metallicity .",
    "next , we numerically calculated the protostellar evolution with the derived accretion rates at each metallicity .",
    "the calculated evolution depends on the metallicity . for lower metallicity",
    ", a protostar has larger radius and arrives at the zams at higher stellar mass .",
    "these variations reflect the difference in the accretion rates .",
    "we also examined radiative feedback effects that may halt the mass accretion onto a protostar , i.e. , radiation pressure on a radiative precursor and dust cocoon , and expansion of an h  ii region .",
    "the radiation pressure exerted on the dust cocoon limits mass accretion for @xmath4 . the upper mass limit increases with decreasing metallicity . at low metallicity ,",
    "the high accretion rate and low dust opacity enable the accreting flow to overcome the radiation pressure barrier .",
    "for @xmath126 , the expansion of an h  ii region instead will disrupt the accretion envelope .",
    "the mass limit resulting from the h  ii region expansion also increases with decreasing metallicity because higher density in the flow hinders the development of the hii region .",
    "these feedback effects become significant after the protostar reaches the zams , but before the stellar lifetime is over . with the accretion rates ten times higher than the fiducial values ,",
    "radiation pressure on the radiative precursor limits the steady mass accretion at @xmath150 for @xmath154 .",
    "cores of two typical mass - scales are produced by fragmentation over wide ranges in metallicity .",
    "one scale comes from line cooling ( @xmath173 ) , and the other from dust cooling ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the mass limit due to the radiative feedback effects is far higher than the typical masses with dust cooling , and comparable to those with line cooling . in massive cores formed by line - induced fragmentation ,",
    "the radiative feedback effects terminate mass accretion and set the final stellar masses .",
