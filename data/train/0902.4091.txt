    "one thing we can do is to determine the recurrence equations satisfied by the data we are given .",
    "any recurrence for @xmath20 must certainly be among those .    to find the recurrence equations of @xmath20 valid for the first terms ,",
    "the simplest way to proceed is by making an ansatz with undetermined coefficients .",
    "let us fix an order  @xmath28 and a degree  @xmath29 and consider the generic recurrence ( [ eq : rec ] ) , where the @xmath30 are indeterminates .",
    "for each specific choice @xmath31 , we can evaluate the ansatz , because we know all the values of @xmath32 in this range , and we obtain a system of @xmath33 homogeneous linear equations for @xmath34 unknowns  @xmath35 .    if @xmath36 , this system is under - determined and is thus guaranteed to have nontrivial solutions .",
    "all these solutions will be valid recurrences for @xmath20 for @xmath37 , but they will most typically fail to hold beyond .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath38 , then the system is overdetermined and nontrivial solutions are not to be expected .",
    "but at least recurrence equations valid for all  @xmath0 , if there are any , must appear among the solutions .",
    "we therefore expect in this case that the solution set will precisely consist of the recurrences of  @xmath20 of order  @xmath18 and degree  @xmath39 valid for all  @xmath0 .    as an example , let us consider the contribution to the gluon splitting function @xmath40 at leading order , @xmath41 .",
    "the first 20 terms , starting with @xmath42 , of the sequence @xmath20 are @xmath43 making an ansatz for a recurrence of order  3 with polynomial coefficients of degree  3 leads to an overdetermined homogeneous linear system with 16 unknowns and 17 equations . despite of being overdetermined and dense",
    ", this system has two linearly independent solutions . using bounds for the absolute value of determinants depending on the size of a matrix and the bit size of its coefficients",
    ", one can very roughly estimate the probability for this to happen `` by coincidence '' to about  @xmath44 . and in fact",
    ", it did not happen by coincidence .",
    "the solutions to the system correspond to the two recurrence equations @xmath45 and @xmath46 which both are valid for all  @xmath47 .",
    "if we had found that the linear system did not have a nontrivial solution , then we could have concluded that the sequence @xmath20 would _ definitely _",
    "( i.e.  without any uncertainty ) not satisfy a recurrence of order  3 and degree  3 .",
    "it might then still have satisfied recurrences with larger order or degree , but more terms of the sequence had to be known for detecting those .",
    "the method of determining ( potential ) recurrence equations for sequences as just described is not new .",
    "it is known to the experimental mathematics community as _ automated guessing _ and is frequently applied in the study of combinatorial sequences .",
    "standard software packages for generating functions such as  @xcite for or  @xcite for  provide functions which take as input a finite array of numbers , thought of as the first terms of some infinite sequence , and produce as output recurrence equations that are , with high probability , satisfied by the infinite sequence .",
    "these packages apply the method described above more or less literally , and this is perfectly sufficient for small examples .",
    "but if thousands of terms of a sequence are needed , there is no way to get the linear systems solved using rational number arithmetic .",
    "even worse , already for medium sized problems from our collection , the size of the linear system exceeds by far typical memory capacities of  1664 gb . for the big problem  @xmath48 , it would require approximately 11 tb of memory to represent the corresponding linear system explicitly .",
    "it is thus evident that computations with rational numbers are not feasible .",
    "instead , we use arithmetic in finite fields together with chinese remaindering and rational reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "modulo a word size prime , the size of the biggest systems reduces to a few gb , a size which easily fits on our architecture . and modulo a word size prime , such a system can be solved within no more than a few hours of computation time by",
    ".    the modular results for several distinct primes @xmath49 can be combined by chinese remaindering to a modular result whose coefficients are correct modulo the product @xmath50 . if the bit size of this product exceeds twice the maximum bit size appearing in the rational solution , then the exact rational number coefficients can be recovered from the modular images by rational reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "the number of primes needed ( and thus the overall runtime ) is therefore proportional to the bit size of the coefficients in the final output .",
    "the final output is a recurrence equation for  @xmath20 .",
    "but the recurrence equation satisfied by a sequence @xmath20 is not unique : if a sequence satisfies a recurrence equation at all , then it satisfies a variety of linearly independent recurrence equations .",
    "the bit size of the rational number coefficients in these recurrence equations may vary dramatically . in order to minimize the number of primes needed for the computation of the rational numbers in the recurrence , it seems preferable to compute on a recurrence whose coefficients are as small as possible in terms of bit size . according to our experience",
    ", this recurrence happens to be the ( unique ) recurrence whose order  @xmath18 is minimal among all the recurrence equations satisfied by  @xmath20 .",
    "we have no explanation for this , but it seems to be a general phenomenon , as it can also be observed in certain combinatorial applications  @xcite .    also the number of unknowns for the linear system may vary dramatically among the possible recurrence equations for  @xmath20 , and it seems preferable to compute on a recurrence where the number of unknowns is as small as possible .",
    "small linear systems are not only preferable because of efficiency , but also because the number of unknowns in the linear system determines the number of initial terms @xmath25 that have to be known a priori in order to detect the recurrence . according to our experience",
    ", the size of the linear system is minimized when the order  @xmath18 and the degree  @xmath39 are approximately balanced .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that the recurrence with _ minimal _ ( in terms of bit size ) rational number coefficients has the _ maximal _ number of unknowns in the corresponding linear system , and vice versa .",
    "but there is a way to combine the advantages of both at a reasonable computational cost .",
    "consider the two recurrence equations and from the example of the gluon ",
    "gluon splitting function at leading order , @xmath51 , quoted above",
    ". a recurrence of smaller order can be obtained from these by multiplying by @xmath52 and by @xmath53 , and then subtracting the results .",
    "the choice of the multipliers is such that the coefficient of @xmath54 in the difference cancels : we obtain @xmath55 the calculation just performed can be recognized as the first step in a difference operator version of the euclidean algorithm  @xcite .",
    "applied to two recurrence equations satisfied by a sequence  @xmath20 , this algorithm yields their `` greatest common ( right ) divisor '' , which is , with high probability , the minimal order recurrence satisfied by  @xmath20 . in our example , the algorithm terminates in the next step , and indeed the sequence @xmath20 of @xmath51 does not satisfy a recurrence of order less than two .",
    "note that the linear system for finding the second order recurrence directly would have involved @xmath56 unknowns instead of the 16 unknowns we needed for finding the third order recurrences . for the big problem  @xmath48",
    ", a direct computation would require 33804 unknowns instead of the 5022 we actually used .",
    "we combine the advantage of a small linear system with the advantage of small coefficients in the output as follows .",
    "we first compute for several word size primes the solutions of a small linear system , but then instead of applying rational reconstruction to those , we compute , for each prime independently , their greatest common right divisor modulo this prime .",
    "we then apply rational reconstruction to recover the rational number coefficients of those .    in summary",
    ", we used the following procedure for finding the recurrence equations .    1 .   [ step:1 ] choose a word size prime  @xmath57 .",
    "[ step:2 ] choose some bounds @xmath18 and @xmath39 and make an ansatz for a recurrence of order  @xmath18 and degree  @xmath39 .",
    "the linear system is constructed and solved modulo  @xmath57 only .",
    "[ step:3 ] if there are no solutions , repeat step  [ step:2 ] with increased bounds @xmath18 and  @xmath39 .",
    "[ step:4 ] if there are solutions modulo  @xmath57 , compute their greatest common right divisor modulo  @xmath57 by the euclidean algorithm for difference operators .",
    "[ step:5 ] repeat steps [ step:1][step:4 ] until chinese remaindering and rational reconstruction applied to the greatest common right divisors for the various primes yields a recurrence that matches the given data @xmath58 .",
    "[ step:6 ] return the reconstructed recurrence as the final result .    for the big problem  @xmath48 , most of the computation time ( about 53% )",
    "was spent in step  [ step:4 ] . solving the modular linear systems consumed about",
    "28% of the time , and chinese remaindering and rational reconstruction took about 18% of the time .",
    "the memory bottleneck is in step  [ step:2 ] where the linear system is constructed .",
    "the memory requirements for the other steps , if implemented well , are negligible .    for problems that are even bigger than those we considered , further improvements to the procedure",
    "are conceivable .",
    "first , there are asymptotically fast special purpose algorithms for step  [ step:2 ] available  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms outperform the naive linear system approach we are taking for problem sizes where fast polynomial multiplication algorithms outperform classical algorithms .",
    "it is likely that their use would have already been beneficial for some of our problems .",
    "second , a gain in efficiency might result from running the procedure on a different platform .",
    "we have done all our computations within  6 , but we expect that in particular step  [ step:4 ] might considerably benefit from a reimplementation in a computer algebra system providing high - performance polynomial arithmetic .",
    "s modular arithmetic , on the other hand , appears to be quite competitive .",
    "third , it might be worthwhile to run parts of the procedure in parallel .",
    "in particular , computations for distinct primes are completely independent from each other and can be done on different processors without any communication overhead .",
    "observe that these steps dominate the runtime .",
    "after having obtained difference equations of high order and degree we will now discuss general , efficient algorithms by which these equations can be solved . _ given _ a recurrence relation @xmath59 of order @xmath18 , _ find _ all its solutions that can be expressed in terms of indefinite nested sums and products .",
    "such solutions are also called dalembertian solutions  @xcite , they form a subclass of liouvillian solutions  @xcite .",
    "note that such solutions cover as special cases , e.g. , harmonic sums  @xcite or generalized nested harmonic sums  @xcite .",
    "the solution to this problem consists of two parts .    1 .",
    "first , compute all dalembertian solutions by factoring the recurrence as much as possible into linear right factors .",
    "then each linear factor contributes to one extra solution . to be more precise , the @xmath60th factor yields a nested sum expression of depth @xmath61 .",
    "second , simplify these nested sum solutions to closed form expressions , e.g. , in terms of harmonic sums , that can be processed further in practical problem solving .    in general",
    ", the package  @xcite can solve these problems in the setting of @xmath19-difference fields  @xcite .",
    "this means that the coefficients @xmath62 and the inhomogeneous part @xmath63 of   can be given as polynomial expressions in terms of indefinite nested sums and products .    for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourself to the situation that the given coefficients @xmath62 are polynomials in @xmath0 and that the inhomogeneous part @xmath63 is zero . in other words , we assume that we are given a recurrence of the form   or   that is produced , e.g. , by the method described in the previous section .",
    "subsequently , we present algorithms that find all dalembertian solutions of  .",
    "equivalently , we can say that we look for all dalembertian sequences which are annihilated by the linear operator @xmath64 which is understood to act on a sequence @xmath20 via @xmath65 we start as follows .",

    "can be carried out by executing a generalized version of algorithm  @xcite that works in general @xmath19-difference fields ; for an alternative algorithm to find such hypergeometric terms we refer to  @xcite .",
    "if there does not exist such a product solution  , then there is no dalembertian solution at all ; see , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.5.5 ) . in this case",
    ", we just stop .",
    "otherwise , we look for additional solutions as follows .",
    "_ step 2 : splitting off a linear right factor .",
    "_ by dividing the operator   from the right with the operator @xmath68 we arrive at an operator @xmath69 of order @xmath70 such that @xmath71 i.e. , @xmath72 is a linear right factor of @xmath73 .",
    "_ step 3 : recursion .",
    "_ now we continue by recursion and look for all dalembertian solutions for the operator @xmath74 with order @xmath70 .",
    "note that after at most @xmath70 steps we end up at a recurrence of order @xmath75 whose dalembertian solution can be read off immediately .",
    "_ step 4 : combining the solutions .",
    "_ if we do not find any dalembertian solution for @xmath74 , we just return the solution   for @xmath73 .",

    "then the final output of our algorithm is @xmath83 the following remarks are in place . by construction",
    "all the elements from   are solutions of  : for each @xmath84 , @xmath85 and hence @xmath86 but even more holds .",
    "the derived solutions   are linearly independent . in particular",
    ", any solution of @xmath73 in terms of indefinite nested sums and products can be expressed as a linear combination of  ; see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* proposition  4.5.2 ) .    summarizing , with the algorithm sketched above we can produce all dalembertian solutions of @xmath73 , i.e. , all solutions that are expressible in terms of indefinite nested sums and products .",
    "we emphasize that the expensive part of the sketched method is the computation of the product solutions  .",
    "the following improvements were crucial in order to solve the recurrences under consideration .",
    "_ improvement 1 .",
    "_ if one finds several product solutions , say @xmath87 , one can produce immediately a recurrence @xmath74 like in  , but with order @xmath88 instead of order @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , given all dalembertian solutions of this operator @xmath74 , one gets all the solutions of the recurrence   without any further computations ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.5.6 ) .",
    "_ improvement 2 .",
    "_ for the problems under consideration , it turns out that it suffices to search for product solutions   that can be written in the form @xmath89 for polynomials @xmath90 and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we used optimized solvers  @xcite of  which generalize the algorithm presented in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , arithmetic in finite fields is exploited in order to determine the solutions   effectively .",
    "_ improvement 3 .",
    "_ in our applications , rather big factors from @xmath91 and @xmath81 cancel in the summand @xmath92 of  ; in particular , the usually irreducible factor @xmath93 from   ( @xmath0 substituted with @xmath60 ) cancels .",
    "hence it pays off to compute directly the summand expression @xmath92 : namely , instead of the operator   we continue with the operator @xmath94 and look for all its dalembertian solutions @xmath95 .",
    "then by construction , the solutions of   can be given directly in the form @xmath96    as illustrative example we solve the difference equation for the @xmath97-term of the unpolarized 3-loop splitting function @xmath98 , @xmath99 using the methods from the previous section , we generate the recurrence relation @xmath100 with @xmath101 given this recurrence , we produce its dalembertian solutions as follows .",

    "the initial values @xmath120 imply @xmath121    for our concrete problems all the recurrences could be factored completely .",
    "equivalently , for a recurrence of order @xmath39 we found @xmath39 linearly independent solutions @xmath122 where the solution @xmath123 with @xmath124 can be given in the form @xmath125 where for @xmath126 the @xmath127 and @xmath128 are polynomials and @xmath129 .

    "<S> about four months of cpu time were needed to establish and solve the recurrences for the anomalous dimensions and wilson coefficients on a 2  ghz machine requiring less than 10  gb of memory . </S>",
    "<S> no algorithm is known yet to provide such a high number of moments for 3loop quantities . yet </S>",
    "<S> the method presented shows that it is possible to establish and solve recurrences of rather large order and degree , occurring in physics problems , uniquely , fast and reliably with computer algebra .    </S>",
