    "unruh s observation in the seventies that the vacuum state of a free quantum field appears as a temperature state when looked at in a uniformly accelerated frame @xcite has been proved for all finite - component wightman fields by bisognano and wichmann , who addressed the problem around the same time and with a more mathematical motivation @xcite .",
    "starting from the field operators located in the rindler wedge , a generic algebraic construction yields a strongly continuous one - parameter group of unitary operators on the one hand and an antiunitary operator on the other .",
    "since these objects arise from the modular theory due to tomita and takesaki , they are referred to as the _ modular unitaries _ and the _ modular conjugation _ of the rindler wedge , respectively .",
    "the modular unitaries turned out to implement lorentz boosts , and the modular conjugations give rise to a pct - operator .",
    "on the other hand , the automorphism group implemented by the modular unitaries , the _ modular group _ , exhibits a property that characterizes thermodynamical equilibrium states , the so - called _ kms - condition _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so the bisognano - wichmann result shows that the vacuum state is a thermodynamical equilibrium state not only in an inertial frame , but also in a uniformly accelerated frame , as unruh found independently for the free field .",
    "while the result of bisognano and wichmann is quite general , there still are field theories of physical interest to which their arguments do not apply , e.g. , anyons in 1 + 2 dimensions or infinite - component wightman fields in any dimension .",
    "what is more , there are examples of theories that do not exhibit the unruh effect @xcite , so the long term goal is to find a criterion that tells the theories showing the unruh effect apart from those without this property .",
    "an important application of the bisognano - wichmann symmetries in low dimensions , which motivated the subsequent analysis , are a couple of recent proofs of pauli s spin - statistics connection and its extension to particles with braid group statistics @xcite .",
    "as this approach does not depend on the special features of finite - component wightman fields , it also provides a spin - statistics connection for 1 + 2-dimensional theories without spinor structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the original bisognano - wichmann analysis is confined to finite - component wightman fields , whereas the symmetries they established are not confined to these fields ; so the further analysis of the bisognano - wichmann symmetries is of interest on its own .    during the last decade ,",
    "several authors have been investigating the unruh effect and pct - symmetry in the algebraic approach to relativistic quantum physics . below for some examples , see @xcite for textbooks on the algebraic approach . ]",
    "this activity has been initiated by borchers proof of two commutation relations which ( essentially ) imply the unruh effect for algebraic theories in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions , and in higher dimensions lead to the impression that there is not much room left for theories violating the effect .",
    "this impression has motivated our subsequent analysis .",
    "the question is what can `` go wrong '' if the modular unitaries or conjugation are known to implement a `` geometric action '' in some way to be made precise .    a first approach to this question specifies this `` geometric action '' by assuming that the adjoint actions of the corresponding operators map the algebra of observables associated with a double cone region @xmath0 onto the algebra associated with some arbitrary open set @xmath1 .",
    "this open set does , a priori , not need to be the image of the double cone @xmath2 under a function from @xmath3 to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 may be bounded or unbounded , and it may be connected or disconnected . it has been shown in @xcite that the modular conjugation implements a pct - symmetry provided that it implements any geometric action in this sense . if the modular unitaries of the rindler wedge act geometrically on the net , they implement the boosts leaving the wedge invariant _ plus a possible translation along the edge of the wedge_. it is shown below that this translation degree of freedom can be eliminated by an application of the borchers - vladimirov double cone theorem on analytic functions in several complex variables . that the double cone theorem can be used here ,",
    "was brought to my attention by s. trebels , whose thesis contains similar results @xcite . with this completion",
    ", the result provides a _ first uniqueness theorem on modular symmetries_.    a similar trick allowed the unruh part of the problem to be treated in an alternative way : if the modular unitaries of the rindler wedge map local observables onto local observables and let their localization regions change in a continuous way , these regions have to transform as under a boost which leaves the rindler wedge invariant .",
    "this will be referred to as the _ second uniqueness theorem on modular symmetries_. in order to investigate this question , the notion of a localization region of a single local observable had to be made rigorous .",

    "<S> the unruh effect and a closely related form of pct - symmetry have been proved in general for finite - component wightman fields by bisognano and wichmann . while this result incorporates most of the fields occurring in four - dimensional high energy physics , </S>",
    "<S> there still are field theories of interest that are not covered ( e.g. , low - dimensional anyon fields and infinite - component fields ) . from the spectrum condition , borchers has derived a couple of commutation relations which `` almost , but only almost '' imply the unruh effect and pct - symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this result does imply unruh effect and pct - symmetry provided that the operators involved in borchers commutation relations act geometrically on a local net of observables . </S>"
