    "our current understanding of most of the processes governing the nuclear systems is based on studies made with stable nuclei , which constitute less than ten percent of all the nuclei known to exist in nature .",
    "away from the valley of stability there are a large number of nuclei having very short half lives and very small one- and two - nucleon separation energies .",
    "many of them exhibit a halo structure in their ground states in which loosely bound valence nucleon(s ) has ( have ) a large spatial extension with respect to the respective core @xcite .",
    "we still lack a fully microscopic understanding of the stability of these unique many body systems .",
    "these nuclei are also important from nuclear astrophysics point of view .",
    "the r - process and the s - process paths which together are dominant mechanisms for nucleosynthesis of heavy elements above iron , pass through the region of neutron rich exotic nuclei , in the segr chart .",
    "properties of these nuclei are , therefore , important inputs to theoretical calculations of stellar burning which otherwise are often forced to rely on global assumptions about nuclear masses , decays and level structures extracted from stable nuclei .",
    "projectile breakup reactions have played a major role in unraveling the structure and properties of halo nuclei .",
    "however it is clear that pure coulomb @xcite or pure nuclear @xcite breakup calculations may not be fully sufficient to describe all the details of the halo breakup data which have been increasing rapidly both in quality and quantity @xcite . in majority of them both coulomb and nuclear breakup effects as well as",
    "their interference terms are likely to be significant and the neglect of the latter terms may not be justified @xcite .",
    "a theory which can take care of the coulomb and nuclear breakup effects as well as their interference terms on an equal footing is an important requirement in interpreting the data obtained from the experiments done already or are planned to be done in future .    for breakup reactions of light stable nuclei",
    ", such a theory has been developed @xcite within the framework of post - form distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , which successfully describes the corresponding data at low beam energies .",
    "however , since it uses the simplifying approximation of a zero - range interaction @xcite between constituents of the projectile , it is inapplicable to cases where the internal orbital angular momentum of the projectile is different from zero .",
    "recently , we have presented a theory @xcite to describe the breakup reactions of one - nucleon halo nuclei within the post - form dwba ( pfdwba ) framework , that consistently includes both coulomb and nuclear interactions between the projectile fragments and the targets to all orders , but treats the fragment - fragment interaction in first order .",
    "the coulomb and nuclear breakups along with their interference term are treated within a single setup in this theory .",
    "the breakup contributions from the entire continuum corresponding to all the multipoles and the relative orbital angular momenta between the valence nucleon and the core fragment are included in this theory where finite range effects are treated by a local momentum approximation ( lma ) @xcite .",
    "full ground state wavefunction of the projectile , of any angular momentum structure , enters as an input to this theory .",
    "the coulomb - nuclear interference ( cni ) terms have also been calculated using the prior - form dwba @xcite and within models @xcite where the time evolution of the projectile in coordinate space is described by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation , treating the projectile - target ( both coulomb and nuclear ) interaction as a time dependent external perturbation .",
    "recently , within an eikonal - like framework , coulomb and nuclear processes have also been treated within the same framework in ref .",

    "this theory can be used to calculate breakup of both neutron and proton halo nuclei .",
    "generally , the maximum value of the partial waves @xmath67 must be very large in order to ensure the convergence of the partial wave summations in eq .",

    "only two terms , with reasonable upper limits , are required to be evaluated by the partial wave expansion in eq .",

    "the wavefunction , @xmath76 , appearing in the structure term , @xmath77 , has been calculated by adopting a single particle potential model in the same way as in ref .",

    "the single particle wavefunction was constructed by assuming the valence neutron-@xmath81be interaction to be of woods - saxon type whose depth was adjusted to reproduce the corresponding value of the binding energy with fixed values of the radius and diffuseness parameters ( taken to be 1.15 fm and 0.5 fm , respectively ) .",
    "this gave a potential depth of 71.03 mev , a root mean square ( rms ) radius for the valence neutron of 6.7 fm , and a rms radius for @xmath0be of 2.91 fm when the size of the @xmath81be core was taken to be 2.28 fm .",
    "the neutron - target optical potentials used by us were extracted from the global set of bechhetti - greenlees ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) , while those used for the @xmath81be - target ( @xcite ) system are shown in table i. following  @xcite , we have used the sum of these two potentials for the @xmath0be - target channel .",
    "we found that values of @xmath74 of 500 for au , ta , u , pb and ti targets and 150 for be and c targets provided very good convergence of the corresponding partial wave expansion series [ eq .",
    "( [ eq17_5 ] ) ] .",
    "the local momentum wave vectors are evaluated at a distance , @xmath32 = 10 fm in all the cases , and their directions are taken to be same as that of asymptotic momenta ( see appendix a ) .       in table iii",
    ", we present the total one - neutron removal cross section in the breakup of @xmath0be on au and be targets at 41 mev / nucleon for different directions of the lm .",
    "we note that these cross sections depend on the local momentum directions only to the extent of @xmath85 .    in figs . 8 and 9",
    ", we show the variation of the neutron angular distribution for different combinations of lm directions of the core and the valence neutron in the breakup of @xmath0be on au and be targets , respectively , at 41 mev / nucleon . in both the figures ,",
    "the solid line shows the calculation with direction @xmath86 . in panel",

    "calculations are shown for directions @xmath87 ( dotted line ) and @xmath88 ( dashed line ) , panel ( b ) shows it for @xmath89 ( dotted line ) and @xmath90 ( dashed line ) , while panel ( c ) shows the same for @xmath91 ( dotted line ) and @xmath92 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we see that for the be target case the neutron angular distributions are minimally dependent on various lm directions , but for the au target case , some dependence is observed at large angles .",
    "however , the magnitudes of the cross sections here are very small .",
    "consequently no such angular dependence will be observed in cross sections which involve angular integrations for both the outgoing fragments or in more inclusive cross sections ."
