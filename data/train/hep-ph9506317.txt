    "tests of qcd carried out at @xmath5 colliders have received a considerable boost at lep and lhc @xcite , where , because of the large centre of mass energy , the perturbative character of jet production becomes quite prevalent .",
    "although jet studies at lep provide convincing evidence of the validity of the perturbative approach , the determination of the strong coupling from jets can not be considered as solid as other type of determinations , like those from the @xmath6 hadronic width or deep inelastic scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "in fact , even at lep energies , there are substantial power suppressed effects that are corrected for using monte carlo models .",
    "the estimate of the theoretical error associated with these corrections is very difficult , and inherently model  dependent .",
    "it would be very desirable to acquire some knowledge of power corrections from theory alone , without the need to resort to models .",
    "some sources of power suppressed effects are in fact understood as originating from factorial growth of the coefficients of the perturbative expansion arising either from the large momentum region ( uv renormalons ) or from the low momentum region ( ir renormalons ) of a certain class of feynman graphs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ir renormalons , uv renormalons and instantons are the only known sources of factorial growth in the perturbative expansion .",
    "instantons are known to give corrections that are suppressed by a very high power of the hard scale involved in the process , while renormalons may give @xmath7 corrections to certain quantities .",
    "it has been argued in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite that @xmath7 power corrections arising from infrared renormalons are present in certain jet shape variables , and that these corrections may also be described in a common framework in terms of a `` frozen '' running coupling constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite the strongest suggestion is made that the @xmath7 corrections may factorize , and it may even be possible to describe power corrections in drell - yan pair production and in jet events in a unified framework .",
    "power corrections to jet shape variables were also considered in a simplified model in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we actually compute the effect of renormalons on jet shape variables in qcd in the limit of large @xmath8 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the theory is not asymptotically free , but we will try to infer the properties of the full theory just by changing the sign of the first coefficient of the beta function at the end of our calculation .",
    "our attitude is that qcd is at least as bad as this limit .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows . in section  2",
    "we will give an introductory description of our calculation , without going into any technical detail .",
    "in fact , the essence of the physical picture that we develop is contained in this section . in section",
    "3 we give a description of the full calculation , and deal with the subtleties associated with canceling the real and virtual divergences by performing the calculation in dimensional regularization . in section  4",
    "we discuss the term ( which we call `` sudakov '' term ) that has a factorized 3body form , which we identify with the term discussed in refs .  @xcite and @xcite . in section  5",
    "we discuss the non - factorizable piece .",
    "we show explicitly that this term is different for thrust and for the heavy jet mass , which are quantities that have the same definitions at the 3parton level , but differ at the 4parton level . in section  6",
    "we discuss the possible effects of subleading corrections , and what could be expected in the full qcd theory .",
    "finally , in section  7 we give our conclusions .",
    "we will first examine the effect of infrared renormalons in the limit of large @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the dominant graphs are those given in fig .",
    "[ threejetsblob ] .",
    "notice that there are two types of contribution , one with three partons in the final state and one with four .",
    "when taking the square of the amplitude with four final state partons the fermions coming from the gluon splitting should not interfere with those coming from the photon vertex in order to give a dominant term in the large @xmath9 limit .",
    "we will now discuss what we expect for the result of the calculation of jet shape variables .",
    "the aim of this discussion is simply to give the flavour of how the exact calculation , which will be presented in the following section , works .",
    "all details of the infrared cancelation will be dealt with in the next section .    in some appropriate renormalization scheme",
    "the inclusion of all vacuum bubbles will amount to the replacement [ evolalfa ] _ s where b_0=- , and @xmath10 .",
    "the contribution of the graphs with three partons in the final state will be simply given by the born cross section , with the replacement of eq .",
    "( [ evolalfa ] ) at @xmath11 . in this limit",
    "our expression vanishes , which is to say , we have no virtual graphs after we have resummed the whole perturbative expansion . it does not vanish , however , order by order in perturbation theory , but has instead an expansion with infrared divergent coefficients . in the next section",
    "we will show that these divergences are canceled order by order in perturbation theory by the real term . for the sake of the present illustrative discussion",
    ", we will instead accept the fact that it vanishes , and concentrate on the finite remainder coming from the real process .",
    "for the corresponding real process , the amplitude will in general have the form a(k^2,)d",

    "we have factored out the infrared divergent term @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 is in fact regular for @xmath16 .",
    "observe that since @xmath13 is positive , the logarithm in the running coupling acquires an imaginary part .",
    "let us now suppose that we are computing some infrared safe shape variable @xmath17 .",
    "infrared safety implies that in the limit of small @xmath13 @xmath17 goes continuously to its three  body form , so that the cancelation between real and virtual infrared divergences takes place .",
    "we define g(k^2)= a(k^2 , ) s(k^2 , ) d. the value of @xmath18 will be given by s = g(k^2 ) | |^2 which we rewrite as s&= & + [ 4body ] & & + g(0 ) . for the integral in the second term",
    "we get & & g(0 ) + & & = + [ 4bodyresult ] & & = -where @xmath19 is an infrared cutoff .",
    "there is a subtlety in the second step , where we use the identity @xmath20 , in which the @xmath21 takes the same sign as @xmath22 .",
    "thus our substitution is only correct when the arguments of both arctangents have the same sign .",
    "this condition is violated if @xmath23 is positive , and it might appear that we have neglected a term proportional to @xmath24 with no coupling in front .",
    "however , we should remember that we are computing a perturbative expansion , and that our algebraic manipulations should always be interpreted as an order by order expansion in @xmath25 .",
    "we should therefore always be reasoning by assuming that terms with factors of @xmath25 are small , even if multiplied by infrared or ultraviolet divergent coefficients . in this sense eq .",
    "( [ 4bodyresult ] ) is correct for either sign of @xmath23 .",
    "the infrared divergent term we obtain cancels against the virtual diagram .",
    "the cancelation is explicitly shown in the next section .",
    "here we just assume that it will take place . in the present context",
    ", the real infrared divergent term vanishes in the same sense in which the virtual term was vanishing .",
    "we see therefore that the only place where we can obtain an infrared renormalon is the first term of eq .",
    "( [ 4body ] ) .",

    "however , this is not to be trusted , since for positive @xmath23 we should interpret our results only as a power expansion in @xmath25 , as discussed earlier .    in case",
    "the behaviour of @xmath34 is of the type @xmath35 instead of a simple power , it is easy to convince oneself that the @xmath33 correction will be enhanced by @xmath36 inverse powers of @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the inclusion of powers of @xmath37 can be achieved from formula ( [ ipdef ] ) by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "thus , since the large order behaviour of the expansion of @xmath39 has the form ( n+1)()^n+1 , taking a derivative with respect to @xmath38 we get the leading behaviour ( n+2)()^n+1 = ( n^+1 ) ( ) ^n^+1 with @xmath40 , which corresponds to a @xmath41 enhancement .    we have therefore found that in our approach the coefficient of the power correction will depend upon the behaviour of @xmath42 for small @xmath13 , which is to say , upon how the definition of the shape variables for 4 partons goes to the 3parton definition in the collinear limit .",
    "this indicates that the coefficient of the power correction can not be simply factorized in terms of the three  body definition of the shape variable , a fact that we will examine in more details in the following sections .",
    "we begin with some kinematical preliminaries .",
    "outgoing legs for the three and four  parton process are given in fig .",

    "one projects the event onto the plane orthogonal to the thrust axis , and then oblateness is defined as the difference between the major and minor axis . for the particular configuration shown in the figure , oblateness is just the difference between the distance 12 ( called @xmath121major ) and the distance 34 ( called @xmath121minor ) in the projected event .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the 34 distance is proportional to @xmath104 . in the limit of @xmath54 oblateness",
    "behaves therefore like @xmath104 , which generates a @xmath7 correction .",
    "the @xmath7 correction in the case of the energy ",
    "energy correlation has instead a very different origin .",
    "one such correction arises from the sudakov term . in the 3body configuration , when parton 3 is soft , the sudakov term for the energy ",
    "energy correlation is ^2 eec ( ) = 81 _ 0 ^ 12q .",
    "the integral over @xmath122 generates a @xmath7 correction .",
    "other contributions come from the @xmath87 term .",
    "consider some weighted average of the energy ",
    "energy correlation , with a weight @xmath123 in an angular interval that does not include the back  to  back region .",
    "then , for example , the contributions coming from partons 1 and 3 would be d_3 f ( ) e_1 e_3 .",
    "if parton 3 ( the gluon ) splits into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair , carrying fractions @xmath67 and @xmath124 of parton 3 s momentum , and having an opening angle @xmath125 . also assume for simplicity that the splitting takes place in the 13 plane .",
    "the contribution in the collinear limit is then & & d_4 e_1e_3 ( f(+z)(1-z)+f(-(1-z))z ) + & & d_4 e_1e_3(f ( ) + f ^()^2z(1-z ) ) + & & = d_4 e_1e_3(f ( ) + f^()s_34/e_3 ^ 2 ) , [ eecexample ] which seems to give rise to a @xmath113 power correction .",
    "this is in fact not the case , since we integrate over the region where @xmath126 becomes small . in this region",
    "the cross section behaves as @xmath127 , so the @xmath126 integral in eq .  (",
    "[ eecexample ] ) yields _ , and we see that in this way a @xmath7 power correction does arise . therefore , the energy ",
    "energy correlation receives @xmath7 power corrections for all values of the angle , coming from the region near the two  jet limit .",
    "it might appear that if we set @xmath128constant , this @xmath7 correction would be zero .",
    "however there would still remain @xmath129-function weights defining the edges of the integration region , which would give equivalent @xmath7 terms .",
    "unlike the case of oblateness , we see that for the eec the correction arises because the kinematic region near the two  jet configuration contributes for all values of the angle .",
    "all other commonly considered shape variables depend instead upon the three jet region for intermediate values of the shape parameter .",
    "we have seen from the previous section that , except for special cases like oblateness , @xmath7 corrections arise from configurations with a soft gluon emission , where the gluon virtuality is of the order of its energy , followed by the decay of the virtual gluon into massless partons .",
    "this process can not occur away from the two jet region at leading @xmath9 , but it can certainly arise at subleading @xmath9 .",
    "we may imagine adding to a three  jet , @xmath130 configuration a soft , off ",
    "shell gluon ( i.e. with energy of the same order as its virtuality ) decaying into a massless parton pair .",
    "it is difficult to imagine any shape variable that will not receive @xmath7 corrections from this kind of process .",
    "in fact , shape variables are typically linear in the parton momenta , as dictated by the requirement of insensitivity to collinear splitting .",
    "the production of a soft , off ",
    "shell gluon reduces linearly the energy available to all the other partons , which in general may affect the shape variable linearly in the gluon energy .",
    "since the cross section for soft gluon emission has the characteristic behaviour @xmath131 , and the emission coupling will be evaluated at the virtuality of the gluon ( assumed to be of the same order as @xmath132 ) it follows that @xmath7 corrections are present .",
    "we have not , of course , rigorously proven this fact .",
    "needless to say , if shape variables that never develop @xmath7 corrections were found , their importance for the determination of @xmath25 would be enormous .",
    "let us therefore assume , for a moment , the pessimistic ( and perhaps realistic ) view that shape variables always develop a @xmath7 correction at some order in perturbation theory .",
    "let us consider , for example , thrust with a cut @xmath133 , so that we are always in the three jet region .",
    "according to the above argument an extra soft gluon emission will generate a correction of order @xmath7 .",
    "it seems plausible however that the hard real emission contributes a factor of @xmath134 , such that the overall correction is of the order of @xmath135 .",
    "this would again be a very important fact .",
    "it would tell us that some shape variables are indeed better than others , in the sense that their @xmath7 power correction carries an extra @xmath136 suppression .",
    "it may also be possible that the @xmath7 suppression will turn out to be enhanced by a power of @xmath137 , which would compensate the @xmath25 suppression .",
    "this could be produced , for example , by a 5parton term that behaved as @xmath138 when particles 4 and 5 become collinear .",
    "whether these logarithmic enhancements are present or not is a matter that ought to be clarified with further studies . in the present work , we simply remark that it is conceivable that one may find shape variables in which the enhancement is not present , and that therefore do have a @xmath25 suppression of the @xmath7 power corrections .",
    "in the present work , we have proven that even in the simple model of qcd at large @xmath9 , shape variables in @xmath5 annihilation show remarkably different properties with regard to power corrections originating from infrared renormalons .",
    "in particular , we have shown that in the large @xmath9 limit , variables like @xmath82 , @xmath139 , and the @xmath118 for any value of the angle , develop a @xmath7 correction , while thrust and the @xmath140 parameter do not develop any @xmath7 correction in the region where the two jet configuration does not contribute .",
    "another remarkable result is that oblateness develops a @xmath7 correction even away from the two jet region .",
    "we compare our findings with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recover a correction term with the factorized form proposed there , but we also find an extra correction that spoils factorization , since it specifically depends upon the 4parton definition of the shape variable .",
    "thus , two shape variables that have the same 3body expression , but differ at the 4body level , will have different power corrections .",
    "the discrepancy with the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite can be tracked back to the fact that they assume to some extent the validity of the perturbative expansion even when the scale of @xmath25 is very low , a fact that does not take place in our calculation in the leading @xmath9 limit .",
    "we argue that even shape variables that do not develop a @xmath7 correction at the leading large @xmath9 level , may develop one at subleading level , and therefore in the full qcd .",
    "we conjecture that the leading power correction to shape variables will have in general the form @xmath141 , and one may classify shape variables according to the value of @xmath36 . it may therefore be possible to find a class of shape variables with leading power correction of the form @xmath135 . with these shape variables ,",
    "the influence of non  perturbative effects upon the determination of @xmath25 would be truly negligible at lep energies .",
