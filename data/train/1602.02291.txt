    "professor miroslav fiedler discovered a very fruitful relationship between connectivity properties of graphs and their spectra . among other things , his works",
    "@xcite from the 1970s , together with other pioneering work  @xcite , gave birth to what is now known as _ spectral partitioning of graphs_. fiedler considered the so called combinatorial laplacian  @xmath0 of graphs  @xmath1 and their spectrum @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "generalizing the fact that  @xmath1 is connected if and only if  @xmath4 , fiedler named  @xmath5 the _ algebraic connectivity _ of  @xmath1 and went on to prove that  @xmath5 is a lower bound for the standard connectivity of  @xmath1 ( unless  @xmath1 is the complete graph ) .",
    "furthermore , he also considered partitioning the vertex set of  @xmath1 by considering the coordinates of the eigenvector belonging to  @xmath5 .",
    "the algebraic connectivity of a graph is now sometimes referred to as the _ fiedler value _ and the associated eigenvector is referred to as the _ fiedler vector_. alon  @xcite and sinclair and jerrum  @xcite later proved that graphs with small fiedler value can be partitioned according to the fiedler vector in a direct way to produce a cut that is small in relative terms ( that is , in terms of the ratio of the number of cut edges to the number of separated vertices ) .",
    "while a small fiedler value tells us that the graph in question may be split along a `` small cut '' , a large fiedler value implies that the graph is an _ expander _ , that is , it has no cuts that are `` small ''  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relation between such `` edge - distribution properties '' and spectra , but focusing on the case of `` uniform edge - distribution '' , by which we mean the _ quasirandom _ case , in the sense of chung , graham and wilson  @xcite .",
    "since we shall be concerned with cayley graphs , which are regular graphs , for simplicity , we shall work with adjacency matrices and _ not _ with combinatorial laplacians .",
    "let an @xmath6-vertex graph  @xmath1 be given .",
    "the _ eigenvalues _ of  @xmath1 are simply the eigenvalues of the  @xmath6  by  @xmath6 , @xmath7@xmath8  adjacency matrix of  @xmath1 , with  @xmath8 indicating edges .",
    "let  @xmath9 be the @xmath10th largest eigenvalue of  @xmath1 , in absolute value . recall that  @xmath1 is said to be `` quasirandom ''",
    "if the edges of  @xmath1 are `` uniformly distributed '' ( we postpone the precise definition ; see definition  [ def : disc_delta ] ) . a fundamental result relating the  @xmath11 to quasirandomness states that _ there is a large gap between  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 @xmath14 _ if and only if _",
    "@xmath1  is quasirandom_.    the assertion above may be turned precise in different ways .",
    "we are interested in the form given by chung , graham , and wilson  @xcite .",
    "recall that  @xcite presents a `` theory of quasirandomness '' for graphs , exhibiting several , quite disparate almost sure properties of graphs that are , quite surprisingly , equivalent in a deterministic sense .",
    "earlier work in this direction is due to thomason  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , and also alon  @xcite , alon and chung  @xcite , frankl , rdl and wilson  @xcite , and rdl  @xcite .",
    "one of the so - called `` quasirandom properties '' that is presented in  @xcite is the `` eigenvalue gap '' between  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "chung and graham  @xcite set out to investigate the extension of the results in  @xcite to _ sparse graphs _",
    ", that is , graphs with vanishing edge - density . as it turns out , a nave approach to such",
    "a project is doomed to fail , as the results in  @xcite _ do not _ generalize to the `` sparse case '' in the expected manner ( for a thorough discussion on this point , the interested reader is referred to  @xcite and also to  @xcite ) . in particular , having succeeded in proving that eigenvalue gap does imply uniform distribution of edges in the sparse case , chung and graham asked whether the converse also holds ( see  @xcite*p .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question would fully generalize the relationship between these two concepts to the sparse case .",
    "however , krivelevich and sudakov  @xcite showed that the answer to the question posed by chung and graham is negative , by constructing a suitable family of counterexamples . here",
    ", our aim is to show that _ the answer is positive if one considers cayley graphs of finite abelian groups , regardless of the density of the graph . _",
    "it is worth noting that several explicit constructions of quasirandom graphs are indeed cayley graphs ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite*section  3 ) .",

    "secondly , we note that in general it is not true that @xmath40 implies @xmath70 for arbitrary sequences of graphs .",
    "this was already pointed out by krivelevich and sudakov in  @xcite . for every @xmath66 and every @xmath26",

    "such a graph @xmath1 has density @xmath84 and for every fixed @xmath26 with high probability it satisfies @xmath35 .",

    "we also remark that in  @xcite , it is proved that , under some additional conditions , @xmath40 implies @xmath70 for sequences of sparse graphs .",

    "consequently , by theorem  [ thm : main_positive ] it also satisfies  @xmath70 .    on the other hand ,",
