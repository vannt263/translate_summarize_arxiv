    "@xcite , all these studies claim that hadronic interactions alone can not account for the @xmath0 suppression in all @xmath3 and @xmath4 data .    implicitly , geometrical models of nuclear absorption such as glauber scattering assume that the nuclei traverse each other without distortion or energy loss .",
    "this seems to be appropriate for the description of the hard drell - yan @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite production processes and some authors also treat charmonium dissociation perturbatively @xcite .",

    "the drell - yan production cross section in @xmath3 interaction is known to scale linearly with @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 . because of the apparent charmonium absorption discussed below there is no direct experimental evidence for linear scaling in charmonium production , or the hard nature of this process , respectively . however , we assume hard production of charmonium since measurements of open charm production in @xmath11 reactions show no significant deviation from @xmath9 scaling @xcite",

    "while the model prescription for the charmonium rescattering stage is varied in order to study different conceivable scenarios , the initialization of the nuclei and the simulation of the hard @xmath15 production process are the same for all calculations presented in this work .",

    "the default values of these parameters are fit to data from elementary hadronic and p+a reactions over a range of energies .",
    "all concepts and parameters related to the treatment of heavy quarkonia in the model are specified in the following .",

    "we use this initialization procedure for the simulation of hard processes via perturbative qcd and the soft hadronic cascade , respectively .",
    "consequently , the average nuclear density profiles are the same . however , in each event , the initial positions of the nucleons are determined independently for the two simulations after the impact parameter @xmath25 is chosen .",
    "thus , we insert the @xmath15 states into the hadronic environment according to an averaged distribution of hard production processes rather than linking the hard and soft simulations event by event .",
    "we therfore avoid strong and probably unphysical spatial correlations between hard and soft processes is chosen to be exactly the arithmetic mean of the positions of the two incident nucleons or randomly distributed between them .",
    "this seems to be unreasonable and is due to the naive geometrical interpretation of the interaction cross section in the semiclassical cascade . ] .    in the microscopic urqmd transport model @xcite , many nucleons are excited to baryonic strings , _",
    "i.e. _ their constituent quarks and diquarks are separated and propagate independently as the endpoints of color flux tubes .",
    "a significant fraction of the constituent quarks in the incident nucleons may thus appear as the core of leading mesons and are allowed to interact immediately after their production while leading baryons containing the remaining diquark interact with a reduced cross section in the urqmd model .",
    "a sharp distinction between nuclear absorption and absorption by secondaries is not supported in this picture of nucleon break - up .",
    "we now introduce the scenarios for quarkonium suppression applied in our simulations .",
    "this scenario follows ref .",
    "charmonium states are assumed to be produced as color - octet ` preresonance ' states , @xmath26 , which exist until after their passage through the nuclei is completed .",

    "the @xmath26 states are produced at rest .",
    "nuclear stopping and a change of the absorption cross section due to string excitation of incident nucleons is not considered .",
    "then , in the urqmd simulation , all but the charmonium - nucleon interactions have zero cross sections .",
    "@xmath0 dissociation by secondary hadrons is not taken into account , since qcd calculations with heavy quarks predict a strong damping close to threshold @xcite .",
    "there is one free parameter , the @xmath26nucleon cross section .      according to this scenario , nuclear absorption is due to interactions of color - octet states .",
    "thus , absorption by nucleons is calculated as in scenario  i , and the @xmath26 dissociation cross section is the first free parameter .",
    "thus , we follow the arguments of @xcite and the ` preresonance ' hypothesis , respectively , as far as the nuclear absorption is concerned .    then , in a full urqmd simulation , the environment of secondary hadrons is calculated .",
    "after their finite formation time ( on average , @xmath27 fm / c ) resulting from the string fragmentation used in the urqmd model , secondary hadrons may dissociate the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are assumed to be fully formed states by @xmath28 . in order to clearly separate the nuclear absorption of color - octet states from the delayed interactions of produced mesons with the asymptotic color - singlet states ,",
    "we exclude the prompt interactions of leading secondary hadrons .",
    "the interaction of the leading quarks is effectively accounted for in the calculation of the nuclear absorption because the possible break - up of the incident nucleons due to a string excitation is ignored .    to calculate charmonium dissociation by secondary hadrons ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between the distinct charmonium states in the simulation .",
    "the charmonium states are distributed according to their assumed production probability times their decay probability to @xmath0 s .",
    "thus 40% of the final states are @xmath2 s , 55% are @xmath0 s , and 5% are @xmath1s @xcite .",
    "according to the degeneracy of the angular momenta , 1/3 of the @xmath2 s are @xmath29 states and 2/3 are @xmath30 states .",

    "[ ratab ] , the @xmath1 survival probability in s+u collisions in scenario  iii would need to be increased by more than 50% in order to agree with the experimental observations . to test the effect of refeeding , we have implemented the process @xmath92 in urqmd with an energy independent cross section above the kinematic threshold , @xmath93 .",

    "therefore , in view of the theoretical uncertainties concerning charmonium dissociation cross sections and formation times it seems premature to draw definite conclusions from the model comparison presented here .",
    "since lowering the sps beam energy has been discussed , it is worthwhile to check if such a change could distinguish between an evolving @xmath15 dissociation cross sections and a constant cross section . with a constant cross section",

    "there is no cancelation , however , in the case of evolving cross sections . in the limit of very high beam energies the nuclei become transparent for charmonium states despite the large nuclear density , since the absorption cross section is essentially zero immediately after production .",
    "comover absorption , on the other hand , should increase with energy in both scenarios because the number of secondaries rises .",
    "however , the average comover velocity should be also enhanced which increases their average formation times in the center of mass frame counteracting the effect of increasing density .",
    "thus for very high energies , disregarding leading hadrons , absorption by comovers must eventually become negligible due to the large formation times . in any case , the comover density and its time evolution varies with energy and can lead to different characteristic behaviours within the two scenarios .",

    "dissociation by nucleons stays constant in scenario  ii while it decreases with increasing beam energy in scenario  iii .",
    "the numerical results show that the comover absorption gets slightly stronger with increasing energy both for constant and evolving dissociation cross sections .",
    "the combined effects of absorption by baryons and mesons lead to a decrease of the @xmath0 survival probability for 80  gev as compared to 160  gev in the case of evolving cross sections and an increase for constant cross sections . however , the relative change of the survival probability is only on the order of a few percent in both cases .",
    "thus the experimental distinction between the two scenarios with the suggested change of beam energy is unlikely .",
    "another means by which the charmonium production mechanism might be determined is the study of the survival probability as a function of rapidity .",
