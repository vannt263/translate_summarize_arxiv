    "classical vacuum is a linear medium for which the principle of superposition holds .",
    "consequently , light propagation in classical vacuum is unaffected by the presence of a magnetostatic field . however , within the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , vacuum is a nonlinear medium jackson .",
    "the qed vacuum can be linearized for a rapidly time - varying electromagnetic field with a small amplitude subjected to a slowly varying ( or static ) magnetic field adler2007 .",
    "a consequence of linearization is that the qed vacuum appears as a uniaxial dielectric  magnetic medium for optical fields adler71 .",
    "the constitutive parameters which characterize this uniaxial medium depend on the magnitude and direction of the magnetostatic field .",
    "the degree of anisotropy associated with the qed vacuum is exceedingly small .",
    "consequently , a direct measurement of this attribute poses enormous challenges to experimentalists iac , and experimental verification of the anisotropy of the qed vacuum is eagerly awaited zav . in view of this difficulty",
    ", we propose an experimental simulation of the qed vacuum which would enable the anisotropy to be explored for practicable magnetostatic fields .",
    "the simulation is based on a homogenized composite material ( hcm ) , which arises from the homogenization of remarkably simple component materials .",
    "for example , the component materials could be isotropic dielectric and magnetic materials , randomly distributed as oriented spheroidal particles .",
    "similar hcm - based simulations have recently been described for the schwarzschild-(anti-)de sitter spacetime ml_prb and cosmic strings ml_cloak .    in the following sections ,",
    "3-vectors are underlined with the addition of the @xmath0 symbol denoting a unit vector .",
    "double underlining indicates a 3@xmath13 dyadic with the dyadic transpose being labelled with the additional @xmath2 symbol .",
    "the 3@xmath13 identity dyadic represented as @xmath3 .",
    "the permittivity and permeability of classical vacuum are written as @xmath4  f  m@xmath5 and @xmath6  h  m@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we consider vacuum under the influence of a magnetostatic field @xmath7 , as reported by an inertial observer . however , this is not the case for the qed vacuum .",
    "the qed vacuum is a nonlinear medium which can be linearized for rapidly time  varying plane waves .",
    "thereby , for propagation of light , qed vacuum is represented by the anisotropic dielectric ",
    "magnetic constitutive relations adler71 @xmath8 the relative permittivity and relative permeability dyadics of the qed vacuum have the uniaxial forms lm07 @xmath9 where the constant @xmath10 .",
    "the constitutive dyadics were derived by adler adler71 from the heisenberg ",
    "euler effective lagrangrian of the electromagnetic field e , schwinger .",
    "since @xmath11 is exceedingly small , the value of @xmath12 is also exceedingly small in comparison with unity for typical values of @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in the pvlas experiment @xmath14 t typically zav , which yields @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , the degree of anisotropy represented by the constitutive dyadics is also exceedingly small . in order to achieve degrees of anisotropy that could be realistically attained in a controlled manner for a practical simulation of qed vacuum",
    ", we implement the affine transformation @xmath16 of the spatial coordinates .",
    "the transformation dyadic @xmath17 employs @xmath18 and the scalar parameter @xmath19 . for definiteness , we fix @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the affine - transformed relative permittivity and permeability dyadics are given as pio_cloaking @xmath21 and @xmath22 notice that for the range @xmath23 t , the denominators of both terms on the right side of eq .",
    "are both approximately equal to unity , and therefore @xmath24 .",
    "the components @xmath25 and @xmath26 are linearly dependent upon @xmath13 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the plots of @xmath27 versus @xmath13 are practically identical to those of @xmath28 .",
    "let us now turn to the question : how can one specify an hcm which is a uniaxial dielectric - magnetic material with relative permittivity dyadic @xmath29 and relative permeability dyadic @xmath30 ? in order to answer this question , we make use of the well - established bruggeman homogenization formalism @xcite .",
    "suppose we consider the homogenization of four component materials , labelled @xmath11 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "two of the components ( @xmath11 and @xmath31 , say ) are isotropic dielectric materials while the other two ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are isotropic magnetic materials .",
    "thus , the component materials are specified by    * the relative permittivities @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 , with @xmath38 ; and * the relative permeabilities @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .    the four component materials are randomly distributed with volume fractions @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "all four component materials consist of identically oriented spheroidal particles .",
    "the symmetry axis for all these spheroidal particles lies parallel to @xmath49 .",
    "accordingly , the surface of each spheroid relative to its centre is prescribed by the vector @xmath50 wherein the shape dyadic @xmath51 is real symmetric lakh2000 and positive definite , the radial unit vector is @xmath52 , and the linear measure @xmath53 is required to be small compared to the electromagnetic wavelengths under consideration .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath54 for prolate spheroids and @xmath55 for oblate ones .    under the bruggeman homogenization formalism ,",
    "the corresponding hcm is a uniaxial dielectric - magnetic material , specified by relative permittivity and permeability dyadics of the form @xmath56 for the particular case of the uniaxial dielectric - magnetic hcm involved here , full details of the numerical process of computing the dyadics @xmath57 and @xmath58 , from a knowledge of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are provided elsewhere ml_prb .",
    "conventionally , homogenization formalisms are used to estimate the constitutive parameters of hcms , based on a knowledge of the constitutive and morphological parameters of their component materials and their volume fractions .",
    "in contrast , here our goal is to estimate the constitutive and morphological parameters as well as the volume fractions of the component materials which give rise to a hcm such that @xmath57 coincides with @xmath63 and @xmath58 coincides with @xmath64 .",
    "we do so via an inverse implementation of the bruggeman formalism .",
    "formal expressions of the inverse bruggeman formalism are available wsw_motl , but in some instances these can be ill - defined herkaev . in practice , the inverse formalism may be more effectively implemented by direct numerical methods ml_jnp .",
    "note that certain constitutive parameter regimes have been identified as problematic for the inverse bruggeman formalism sj_tgm , but these regimes are not the same as those considered here .",
    "we consider the following three different implementations of the inverse bruggeman formalism . in each implementation , four scalar parameters are to be determined .    * the relative permittivities @xmath65 and the relative permeabilities @xmath66 are assumed to be known , and all spheroidal particles have the same shape , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "we then determine the common shape parameter @xmath68 and the volume fractions @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "* the relative permittivities @xmath65 and the relative permeabilities @xmath66 are assumed to be known , and the volume fractions @xmath69 are fixed .",

    "next :    * let @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . for all @xmath80 , determine the value @xmath81 which yields the minimum value of the scalar quantity @xmath82^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * let @xmath83 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",

    "while the volume fractions vary little as @xmath102 is increased from 1 to 2.5 t , the common shape parameter increases exponentially . * the constitutive parameters of the component materials were again taken to be @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath103 for fig .  [ fig3 ] .",

    "the computed four shape parameters @xmath61 are plotted versus @xmath102 .",
    "all four shape parameters increase uniformly as @xmath102 is increased from 1 to 2 t. this reflects the fact that the degree of anisotropy of the hcm is required to increase as @xmath102 increases .",

    "is increased from 1 to 3 t , the opposite is true of @xmath35 and @xmath42 .",
    "by means of the inverse bruggeman formalism , an hcm may be specified which is electromagnetically equivalent to the qed vacuum subject to a spatial affine transformation .",
    "the affinely transformed qed vacuum retains the same uniaxial dielectric - magnetic form as the un - transformed qed vacuum , but the degee of anisotropy is greatly exaggerated by means of the affine transformation . by reversing the transformation represented by eq .",
    ", the properties of qed vacuum may be inferred from those of the hcm .    for illustration ,",
    "the inverse homogenization formulation presented here was based on four isotropic component materials .",
    "however , the desired hcm could also be realized by alternative inverse homogenization formulations .",

    "these two components materials could be either both isotropic dielectric - magnetic materials distributed as oriented spheroidal particles or both uniaxial dielectric - magnetic materials ( with parallel symmetry axes ) distributed as spherical particles ab , mw_jopa . however , the four - component formulation presented here involves the simplest of component materials and allows a large degree of freedom in choosing their constitutive parameters .    finally , let us note that the relative permittivities and relative permeabilities of the component materials needed for the hcm , as presented in figs .",
