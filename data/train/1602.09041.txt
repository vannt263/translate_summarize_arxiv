    "<S> using the qcd sum rule approach we investigate the possible four - quark structure for the new observed @xmath0 narrow structure ( d0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use a diquak - antidiquark scalar current and work to the order of @xmath1 in full qcd , without relying on @xmath2 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> our study indicates that although it is possible to obtain a stable mass in agreement with the state found by the d0 collaboration , a more constraint analysis ( simultaneous requirement of the ope convergence and the dominance of the pole on the phenomenological side ) leads to a higher mass . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the masses of the bottom scalar tetraquark resonances with zero and two strange quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the d0 collaboration reported the observation of a narrow structure , called @xmath3 , in the decay @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first observation of a hadronic state with two quarks and two antiquarks of four different flavors and , therefore , can only be explained as a tetraquark or molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and width of the observed state were reported to be : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , considering the large mass difference between the mass of the @xmath3 and the sum of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 masses , it can be difficult to explain the @xmath3 as a molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath3 is an excellent candidate for a tetraquark state . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath0 pair in the @xmath3 decay is produced in @xmath9-wave , its quantum numbers are @xmath10 as the very narrow @xmath11 state , first discovered in the @xmath12 decay channel by the babar collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to its low mass , the structure of the @xmath13 meson has been extensively debated . </S>",
    "<S> it has been interpreted as a @xmath14 state @xcite , two - meson molecular state @xcite , @xmath15- mixing @xcite , four - quark states @xcite or a mixture between two - meson and four - quark states @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use the qcd sum rule ( qcdsr ) approach @xcite to investigate the possible four - quark structure for the @xmath3 and , therefore , to test if the @xmath3 could be the isovector bottom partner of the @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcdsr for scalar mesons are constructed from the two - point correlation function written in terms of a scalar current @xmath17 : ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0 |t[j_s(x)j^_s(0)]|0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the key idea of the qcdsr method is to consider that this correlation function is of dual nature and it depends on the value of the momentum @xmath18 . for large momentum , i.e. , short distances </S>",
    "<S> , the correlation function can be calculated using perturbative qcd . in this case , the current @xmath17 is written in terms of the quark content of the studied mesons . however , since we are interested in studying the properties of hadrons , the relevant energies are lower and contributions from quark condensates , gluon condensates , etc . , need to be included in the evaluation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . this can be done by using the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) of the correlation function . in this case , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) is expanded in terms of local condensates and a series of coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the local operators incorporate nonperturbative long - distance effects , while the coefficients , by construction , include only the short - distance domain and can be determined perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> this way of evaluating the correlation function is customarily named as the calculation on the  ope side \" .    at large distances , or , equivalently , small momentum , the currents @xmath19 and @xmath17 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) can be interpreted as operators of creation and annihilation of the scalar mesons . in this case , the correlation function is obtained by inserting a complete set of scalar states . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of the correlation function is called as the  phenomenological side \" . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption made in the qcdsr approach is that there must be a range of @xmath20 values in which both descriptions must be equivalent . calculating the correlation function of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> of course a scalar - scalar diquark - antidiquark form is not the only possible choice for a scalar tetraquark current , and one could use pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar , vector - vector or axial - axial diquark - antidiquark form . </S>",

    "<S> , we analyze the pole contribution , the ope convergence and the borel stability . in the qcdsr approach </S>",
    "<S> we extract information only from the ground state , therefore we must ensure that the pole contribution is greater that the continuum contribution . here </S>",
    "<S> we fix the borel mass in such a way that the pole contribution is always between 80% and 50% of the total contribution . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we can see that this condition is satisfied for values of the borel mass in the range @xmath38 .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> using the central values of the parameters in table  [ tab1 ] and @xmath40 we get m_x~5.58 .    </S>",
    "<S> to evaluate the uncertainties inherent to the qcd sum rule approach , we consider the variation of the mass in borel window , as a function of the continuum threshold , changed within a small range : @xmath41 , and the quark masses and condensates errors indicated in table  [ tab1 ] . considering these uncertainties </S>",

    "<S> the requirement of a good convergence sets a lower limit to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis in shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , there is no ope convergence in any region allowed by the upper bound given by pole / continuum analysis : @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the lower bound given by ope convergence will be higher than the upper bound , and there is no valid `` sum rule window '' where we can completely trust the results for this current .    to overcome this problem </S>",
    "<S> we can consider higher dimension condensates in the ope side and test if the series starts converging with such contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we include the condensates of dimension seven and eight whose expressions are given below : & & ^|ssg^2(s)= , ^g^2(s)&=&- ,    & & ^|qgq(s)= ,    & & ^|ss|qgq(s)=- ,    ^|sgs(s)=-(6+(s - m_b^2 ) ) ,    ^g^4g^4(s)&=&- .    </S>",
    "<S> on continuing with our analysis we find that , even after considering condensates up to dimension eight , a valid `` sum rule window '' exists only for values of @xmath43 . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] we show the ope convergence and the pole versus continuum contribution for @xmath43 .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we can see that there is an ope convergence , the dimension eight condensate contribution is smaller than 20% of the total contribution , only for values of @xmath44 . on the other hand , from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] we can see that the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution for values of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> although very small , there exists a valid borel window in the region @xmath46 , which provides a good `` sum rule '' to extract a reliable value for the mass of the state .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the crosses in the figure indicate the `` sum rule window '' .    finally , considering all the restrictions described above we get : m_x=(6.390.10 ) , [ result2 ] which is not in agreement with the experimental mass of the @xmath3 determined by the d0 collaboration @xcite . as a matter of fact , recently the lhcb collaboration has not confirmed the observation of the @xmath3 . in their preliminary analysis @xcite </S>",
    "<S> no structure is found in the @xmath0 mass spectrum from the @xmath47 threshold up to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> more analyses are required to clarify this situation . </S>",
    "<S> our work predicts a tetraquark state decaying in this channel with a mass around 6.39 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result2 ] ) is only related with the range of values of the borel mass window , a small variation in the continuum threshold , @xmath49 , and the quark masses and condensates errors indicated in table  [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the values in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result1 ] ) and ( [ result2 ] ) can be associated mainly with the change in the value of the continuum threshold . however , as discussed above , there is no allowed borel window for values of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the result obtained with @xmath51 given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result1 ] ) , although being obtained in a borel region where one has pole dominance , can not be trusted . </S>",
    "<S> this result illustrates very well how we can reproduce the mass of a given state and then after a more careful analysis conclude that the state is not the particle associated with the chosen current . </S>",
    "<S> we also would like to point out that the difference between @xmath52 and the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result2 ] ) is about 0.5gev , as the general supposition of the qcdsr approach for the start of the continuum threshold . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to notice that the difference : @xmath53 increases with the value of the continuum threshold . as an example , for @xmath54 we get @xmath55 which implies @xmath56 , much larger than 0.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an indication that there is a contribution from higher resonances below the continuum threshold and , therefore , once again , the estimated mass can not be trusted . therefore , to fix a `` good range '' of the values of @xmath27 we test if it provides an allowed borel window ( where both constraints of the pole dominance and the ope convergence are satisfied ) , and that the value of the obtained mass falls within the range 0.4 gev to 0.6 gev smaller than @xmath57 . using these criteria , </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained @xmath27 in the range @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can extend the formalism to study bottom scalar mesons states that contain zero and two strange quarks . in order to calculate the correlation function for these states we use the following interpolating fields for these states ( zero and two strange quarks , respectively ) :    j_0&=&_abc_dec(u_a^tc_5q_b ) ( |d_d_5c|b_e^t ) , + j_ss&=&_abc_dec(u_a^tc _ </S>",
    "<S> 5s_b)(|s_d_5c|b_e^t ) , [ int2 ] where @xmath18 represents the quark @xmath59 or @xmath60 according to the charge of the meson . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the resulting spectral densities are given in appendix  a.    we call @xmath61 and @xmath62 the scalar bottom tetraquark mesons represented by @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively ( eq .  [ int2 ] ) . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we show the masses of the states as a function of the borel mass for different values of the continuum threshold , and as the previous case there is good @xmath39-stability in the allowed borel window , represented by the crosses in these figures .    </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained for the masses of the states are : m_b_0 ^ 0s=6.100.16 , + m_b_0 ^ 2s=6.390.17.[result3 ] the sources of errors are the same that were used for the strange - bottom scalar meson .    comparing the results of the masses in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result2 ] ) and ( [ result3 ] ) we can see that the @xmath24 ( the state with one strange quark ) and @xmath65 resonance masses are basically degenerated , while the mass of @xmath66 is around @xmath67 smaller than the others . </S>",
    "<S> the same behavior is observed for the scalar mesons in the charm sector , as it was pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in the mass is expected with the inclusion of one strange quark ( from zero to one strange quarks ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fact this is not observed when one goes from one to two strange quarks can be traced when we compare the contribution of the quark condensate term , that is smaller for the @xmath65 , but this is compensated by the inclusion of a term @xmath68 ( eq .  [ rhoms ] ) .    in summary , we have presented a qcd sum rule study for a bottom scalar meson considered as diquark - antidiquark state . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation of the study is to look for a possible state associated with the recently claimed @xmath3 by the d0 collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is possible to obtain a stable mass in agreement with the state found by the d0 collaboration while satisfying the condition of the pole dominance on the phenomenological side , but by sacrificing the simultaneous constraint of the ope convergence . </S>",
    "<S> this last missing ingredient casts a doubt on the reliability of the result , leading us to conclude that the @xmath3 state can not be represented by the scalar tetraquark current . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a rigorous application of qcd sum rule constraints leads to a higher mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we predict the existence of a scalar bottom - strange tetraquark state with a mass around 6.4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also have obtained the masses for the resonances with zero and two strange quarks , which we call @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> these resonances have also not been observed yet , but our calculations show that they should exist .    : this work has been supported by cnpq and fapesp .    </S>",
