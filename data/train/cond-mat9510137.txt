    "kauffman networks are a disordered dynamical system .",
    "they were introduced in 1969 as a simplified model of the genetic regulatory system acting in cell differentiation @xcite . the debate about cellular automata grew the interest of physicists about the model @xcite .",
    "it was soon recognized @xcite that it has deep analogies with a disordered system studied in statistical mechanics , the infinite range spin glass , whose properties had been investigated and understood in the immediately former years @xcite .",
    "a configuration of the system consists of @xmath0 binary variables , @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in the biological metaphor , the variable @xmath3 represents the state of activation of the @xmath4-th gene in the cell .",
    "the configuration space is provided of a metric structure through the hamming distance ( normalized to one ) , say the fraction of variables whose states are different between two configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 : d(c , c ) = 1n_i=1^n(_i-_i2)^2 .",
    "the system is disordered in the sense that the dynamic is deterministic , but its rules are chosen at random at the beginning in the following way : for each gene @xmath4 , @xmath7 genes are extracted randomly to send a signal to it ( the same gene can be extracted more than once ) ; these are denoted by @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; for each gene @xmath4 and each of the @xmath10 configurations of the signal it can receive , the value of the response function @xmath11 is extracted to be 0 with probability @xmath12 and 1 with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the dynamic rules are then quenched and do not change during the evolution of the system .    at each time",
    "step the @xmath0 variables are updated simultaneously , according to the signal received and to the response to that signal : _",
    "i(t+1)=f_i(_j_1(i),_j_k(i ) ) .    in a more compact way",
    ", the evolution law can be put in the form @xmath14 , where @xmath5 denotes a configuration of the dynamic variables and @xmath15 a configuration of the dynamic rules .",
    "due to the fact that configuration space is finite , every trajectory ends up , after a transient time , on a periodic orbit , and configuration space is partitioned into a certain number of attraction basins of weight @xmath16 , where the @xmath17 labels the periodic orbit .",
    "so , as it is customary in the theory of disordered systems , three kinds of average have to be defined :    * the time average , which is equivalent to the average over a given limit cycle . * the average over the same network , where different cycles have to be weighted with their own @xmath16 . * the average over different realizations of the network .",
    "it was soon discovered that kauffman networks have two different kinds of dynamical behaviours : a @xmath18 regime , when the average cycle length grows as a power of @xmath0 , and a @xmath19 regime when it grows exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible to characterize this transition as a phase transition and two order parameters have been found to describe it .",
    "derrida and pomeau considered the average limit distance between configurations on two randomly chosen trajectories in the same network .",
    "they computed its value in the framework of the annealed approximation and found that it is zero in the frozen phase ( in the limit of an infinite network : remember that the distance is defined as the fraction of different variables ) , while it is different from zero in the chaotic one @xcite .",
    "then flyvbjerg introduced the concept of _ stable core _ , defined as the set of the variables that evolve to a constant state not depending on the initial configuration .",
    "the fraction of variables belonging to the stable core is 1 ( in the limit of infinite @xmath0 ) in the frozen phase while is less than 1 in the chaotic phase @xcite .",
    "the transitions described by these parameters take place at the same critical point , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is such that @xmath22 @xcite .    despite of the success of this approach , the connection between these order parameters and dynamical properties ( of the kind of the average cycle length or the weights of attraction basins ) is still lacking .",
    "this work is a contribute to fill in this gap .    in the second section",
    "we define the closing probabilities , which are the quantities that allow to compute the full cycle length and transient time distribution .",
    "section 3 describes the annealed approximation , first introduced by derrida and pomeau @xcite , that here is used to compute the distribution of the overlap between different time configurations and the closing probabilities , whence we obtain the distribuition of cycle lengths ( section 4 ) and the distribution of attraction basins weigths in the chaotic phase ( section 5 ) , which turn out to be the same as those obtained by derrida and flyvbjerg in the limit case @xmath23 ( the so called random map ) @xcite .",
    "section 6 deals with the average number of cycles in a given network , which is computed in the chaotic phase , in the framework of the annealed approximation .    in section",
    "7 numerical results are presented .",
    "this section is subdivided into three subsections : in the first one , data concerning the distribution of the overlap are shown ; they support the validity of the annealed approximation , but only in some range of the temporal variables . in section @xmath24 simulations about the closing probabilities",
    "are reported , which show deviations from the annealed approximation after an initial agreement . in section @xmath25",
    "we show the exponents which give the @xmath0 behaviour of the average cycle length for different values of the parameter @xmath7 ; there is a good agreement between our computations and the numerical results , but the distribution of cycle lengths that we measured is quite different from the predicted one .    in the last section we interpret the meaning of the approximation used and the discrepancies that we noticed with the simulations , and point out the direction of future work .",
    "in the following , we will use the overlap @xmath26 to describe the metric of configuration space .",
    "we will follow a stochastic strategy , with the aim to compute the probability distribution of the overlap @xmath27 between the configurations @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , on the same trajectory .",
    "it is convenient to consider only trajectories not yet closed at time @xmath31 , so what we actually want to compute is a conditional probability , that we denote by the symbol @xmath32 .",
    "we define the closing probability @xmath33 as the probability to find @xmath34 , which means that the two configurations are equal , over a trajectory not yet closed at time @xmath31 :    _ n(t , t)=p \\ { q(t , t)=1q(t_1,t_2 ) < 1 , t_1<t_2 < t}.    we will have also to deal with the integral closing probability , @xmath35 , which is the probability that a trajectory not yet closed closes at time @xmath36 regardless of the length of the cycle reached , @xmath37 .",
    "then it is easy to compute @xmath38 , the probability that a trajectory has not yet closed at time @xmath36 .",
    "it satisfies the equation @xmath39 , whence , in the limit of large systems , introducing a continuous time variable , and using the fact that @xmath35 is small even at times when nearly every trajectory has closed , one finds the simple expression    [ f ] f_n(t)= ( -_0^t _ n()d ) , so that the probability to find a trajectory that , after a transient time @xmath36 , reaches a cycle of length @xmath40 , is given by    [ periodo ]",
    "p\\ { t = t , l = l } =( -_0^t+l _",
    "n()d ) _ n ( t , t+l ) .",
    "the goal to compute the overlap distribution becomes easier if one can reduce the dynamics of the overlap to a stochastic process .",
    "we can treat kauffman model as a stochastic process by extracting the values of the response functions not at the beginning , but every time a variable receives a signal that it had never received , and using the values already extracted every time the same signal comes back .",
    "note that , if every gene receives signals from the whole system , we have not to worry about this last eventuality , which never occurs before the trajectory closes . in this case the annealed approximation that we are going to define is exact .",
    "this case corresponds to the limit of infinite @xmath7 and is known as the random map model , studied ananlitically by derrida and flyvbjerg @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we generalize their results to finite @xmath7 values , in the framework of the annealed approximation .",
    "thus , in order to compute the overlap between two configurations , for every gene we distinguish two cases : either the gene received the same signal @xmath41 at the two previous time steps , and so it will be in the same state , or it did nt :    q(t+1,t+1)=1n_i _ s_i(t)s_i(t ) + 1n_i ( 1-_s_i(t)s_i(t))_f(s_i(t ) ) f(s_i(t ) ) .",
    "now , the annealed approximation consists in this : we extract at random _ at every time step _ all the connections in the network , keeping memory only of the minimal information about the overlap @xmath27 , so that the probability that the two signals @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the same is @xmath43 ; if they are not equal , we extract at random the values of the response function , and they will be equal with probability @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "derrida and pomeau introduced the annealed approximation in order to obtain the equations for the evolution of the average hamming distance between two randomly chosen configurations ; we will use it in order to treat the overlap as a markovian stochastic process , and so to compute the closing probabiliies .",
    "we will argue later from our simulations that the overlap distribution obtained through the annealed approximation is very close to the quenched one .",
    "it is not possible , using this kind of approximation , to impose the condiction that the trajectory where we measure @xmath27 was not closed at time @xmath31 : we can only impose that it did not close on a cycle of length @xmath46 .",
    "as we shall see , this fact is likely to be the source of the main discrepancies between the annealed approximation and our simulations .",
    "if we impose this condiction , we obtain the master equation    [ master ] p_n(t+1,t+l+1;q_n)= nn _",
    "m=0^n-1 p_n(t , t+l;q_m ) ( ( q_m))^n ( 1-(q_m))^n - n 1- p_n ( t , t+l;1 ) , where @xmath47 and    [ gamma](x)=(1-)+x^k .    given an initial distribution @xmath48 , the process defined by ( [ master ] ) , which is ergodic because we exclude the overlap @xmath49 , evolves to a stationary distribution independent on both @xmath36 and @xmath40 , which appears only in the initial distribution but not in the transition probability .",
    "we look for a stationary distribution @xmath50 in an exponential form , p_n ( q = x)=c_n ( x)e^-n(x ) .    in the limit",
    "@xmath51 we can use continuous variables , transform the sum into an integral and apply the saddle point method to perform it , obtaining the following selfconsistence equations for the unknown functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( the last one is the saddle point of the integral for a given value of @xmath54 ) : [ alpha ] & ^(q(x))-^(q(x ) ) ( x(q(x))- 1-x1-(q(x)))=0 + & ( x ) = ( q(x))+x(x(q(x ) ) ) + ( 1-x)(1-x1-(q(x ) ) ) , [ alpha2 ] with the condition @xmath55 .",
    "deriving the first equation and inserting the result in the second one we get a non - local transcendent equation for the function @xmath53 :    (q(x))(x(q(x))- 1-x1-(q(x)))=(q(x)1-q(x ) ) -((q(q(x)))1-(q(q(x ) ) ) ) . [ q(x ) ]    we were not able to solve this equation , so we had to solve numerically a discrete version of it in order to obtain the exponent of the closing probability , @xmath56 .    before to turn to this point , however , there are some important features of the overlap distribution that can be easily understood",
    ".    deriving ( [ alpha2 ] ) , we can see that the point @xmath57 where the overlap distribution is concentrated satisfies the equation    q(t+1)=(q(t))[q2 ] , which , at stationarity , becomes    q^*=(q^*)=1-+^k .",
    "[ q * ]    this equation was first derived by derrida and pomeau as a mean field solution of the annealed model @xcite . the condition @xmath58 separates parameter space in two different regions :    * @xmath59 : _ frozen phase_. the only fixed point of the map ( [ q2 ] ) is @xmath60 .",
    "this implies , as we shall see , that @xmath56 goes to zero and the typical cycle length increases less than exponentially with system size .",
    "* @xmath61 : _ chaotic phase_. the fixed point @xmath60 becomes unstable ( moreover , it would give raise to a negative variance ) and the overlap is concentrated around another fixed point of ( [ q2 ] ) , @xmath62 . in this case @xmath56 is finite and the typical cycle length increases exponentially with system size .",
    "the variance of the distribution can also be easily obtained , in the gaussian approximation , deriving ( [ alpha2 ] ) twice and imposing the saddle point condition .",
    "one finds that the variance multiplied by @xmath0 , @xmath63 , follows the recursive equation    v(t+1)=(^(q(t))^2 v(t)+q(t+1)(1-q(t+1 ) ) , whose fixed point is v^*=q^ * ( 1-q^*)1-(^(q^*))^2    it is appearent that the stationary overlap distribution is a non binomial one : the presence of correlations between the genes are made evident by the fact that @xmath64 is larger than @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , it is also easy to see that @xmath66 is approximately equal to @xmath67 and does not diverge , while in the binomial distribution it does .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath7 tends to infinity destroing the correlations between consecutive overlaps , the stationary overlap distribution becomes a binomial one and @xmath68 tends exponentially to @xmath69 .    in the frozen phase ,",
    "when @xmath70 , @xmath60 is the true solution of equation ( [ q * ] ) , and @xmath56 vanishes or , to say better , is of order @xmath71 .",
    "it is important to see how the term of @xmath72 vanishes with time : to see that , let us see what happens at the critical point @xmath73 .",
    "the evolution of the most probable overlap at the critical point , for @xmath74 , is such that , introducing a continuous time variable , q^(t)=1k(q-1)^2 _ i=1^k-1 ( k-1-i)q^i , and the asymptotic behaviour in @xmath36 is 1-q((k-1)t2)^-1 .",
    "let s now turn to the numerical computation of the exponent of the closing probability , @xmath56 .",
    "we have to use the discrete variables @xmath75 ; moreover , in place of the stationary state equation , we consider the evolution of the exponent of the overlap distribution , @xmath76 ( we omit to specify the dependence on @xmath40 , which appears only in the initial condition @xmath77 ) .    neglecting the normalization factor , in the master equation , we get the following map for the evolution of @xmath78 :    & _ t+1(q_i)=q_i(q_i)+ ( 1-q_i)(1-q_i)+ + & _ j <",
    "n(_t(q_j ) -(q_i)((q_j ) ) -(1-q_i)(1-(q_j ) ) ) , [ map ]    this map does not have a fixed point @xmath79 , as it can be seen numerically : for istance , @xmath80 reaches a minimum at a certain time and then increases uniformly .",
    "this increase is not in contradiction with the existence of a stationary distribution ; in fact equation ( [ map ] ) misses the normalization factor @xmath81 , and so the probability computed by means of it has to decrease when the exact probability has reached the stationary value .",
    "the increment is of order @xmath82 , because , after @xmath83 reaches its stationary value @xmath68 , @xmath84 grows of a term of that order due to the difference , @xmath85 , between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , so it is not important because we also miss terms of order @xmath88 in the saddle point approximation . in our algorithm",
    ", we decided to get the function @xmath78 at the time when @xmath80 reaches its minimum value .",
    "there is another finite @xmath0 effect in our numerical calculation : because of the condition @xmath89 ( this means that the overlap @xmath90 can not be taken as a starting point ) , the stationary value of @xmath91 decreases with @xmath0 . in fact , the larger is @xmath0 , the lower can be the minimum in ( [ map ] ) , and the effect , of order @xmath71 , is important especially for @xmath92 , because in this case in the stationary state the minimum in ( [ map ] ) would be attained for @xmath93 .",
    "the finite size effects become more relevant at the critical line @xmath94 . as a discretization effect ,",
    "the most likely value of the annealed distribution is not @xmath60 , because the corresponding value @xmath93 in the equation ( [ map ] ) is not allowed , and at stationarity @xmath95 has a minimum for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 is of order @xmath85 .",
    "actually , in the frozen phase the equation ( [ map ] ) is not more a good approximation , because then we are not allowed to neglect @xmath100 in the denominator of equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "we keep it in the complete form and obtain the equation for the first moments of the distribution : ( 1-)+q^k = q(1-p(1 ) ) + ( p(1 ) ) , whence , at the critical point , neglecting terms of order @xmath101 and @xmath102 , one gets p = k-12(1-q+vn(1-q ) ) .",
    "[ p2 ]    this suggests that both @xmath100 and @xmath103 are of order @xmath104 . combining this fact with the previous results , one finds in the critical line an asymptotic closing probability of the form    [ pk2 ] _",
    "n(t , t)(-4n(k-1)t^2 ) ,    while in the chaotic phase we find an exponential behaviour : _",
    "n(t , t)^(1)n , provided that the smallest time @xmath36 is large enough for the overlap to reach the stationary distribution .",
    "we now use the closing probabilities obtained in the previous section to compute the asymptotic distribution of transient times @xmath105 and cycle lengths @xmath106 .    in the chaotic phase , inserting the expression for the asymptotic closing probability into the equation ( [ periodo ] ) , we obtain    \\{t = t ,",
    "l = l } ( -12(t+l)^2 e^-n ) e^-n , [ perann](from now on , we will shortcut @xmath56 with @xmath17 ) .",
    "so , for finite @xmath7 , we obtain the same form of the distribution as in the random map model , differing only in the value of @xmath17 .    introducing the continuous variables @xmath107 and",
    "@xmath108 , with    [ tau ] = e^12n , the period and transient distribution becomes a continuous distribution with density    f(x , y)=e^-12(x+y)^2 .",
    "[ densa ]    while the form of the distribution predicted by the annealed approximation is not confirmed by our simulations , the @xmath0 behaviour of the time scale @xmath109 is in good agreement with the results of the simulations , as it is shown by figure [ fig_alp ] where we compare the value of @xmath17 obtained by the iteration of equation ( [ map ] ) with twice the exponent of the average cycle length and transient time or with the exponent of the variance of the period obtained by a fit of experimental data , for some @xmath7 value .",
    "other numerical results will be presented later .    in the frozen phase @xmath17",
    "vanishes , and the average cycle length grows as a power of @xmath0 . the closing probability , for @xmath110 ,",
    "is given by _",
    "n(t , t+l)(-(2t)^2 ) , where the time - scale at the critical point is given by = .",
    "this suggests a kind of universality of the critical line in the kauffman model : the time scale of the dynamics diverges always as the square root of the number of the elements ( except for the case @xmath111 , where the variance in the gaussian approximation diverges linearly with @xmath36 , thus destroying the validity of the approximation , and our method fails ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the exponent @xmath17 of the closing probability vanishes quadratically when @xmath112 approaches to the critical point ( except for the case @xmath111 ) .",

    "in kauffman networks configuration space breaks into a number of limit cycles with their own attraction basins .",
    "the statistical distribution of the weights of such basins , @xmath16 ( the rate of the number of configurations in the basin to the total number ) , has been computed in the limit cases @xmath111 and @xmath115 by derrida and flyvbjerg @xcite and flyvbjerg and kjaer @xcite respectively .    in the framework of the annealed approximation it is possible to obtain this distribution for every value of the parameters , at least in the chaotic phase : in this case , it turns out to be the same distribution computed in @xcite for the random map .",

    "in fact one finds that this quantity is linear or less than linear in @xmath36 , so that @xmath38 has a stretched exponential behaviour .",
    "this feature is not surprising because we have already seen that the integral closing probabiity is a decreasing function of @xmath36 from a point on , and @xmath216 is just its integral , but it is striking that the exponent of @xmath36 is a slightly decreasing function of @xmath0 .    this last observation was made looking at the period distribution which is a quantity much easier to compute : to measure @xmath38 one has to keep in memory the whole trajectory , while to measure the period one needs only a reference configuration .    the distribution of cycle length @xmath106 and transient time @xmath105 are simply related to @xmath38 : \\{t = t , l = l}=f_n(t+l)_n(t , t+l ) .",
    "for @xmath139 , the probability to find a cycle of period greater than @xmath36 decays as a stretched exponential , @xmath206 ; the time scale @xmath109 grows exponentially with @xmath0 , with the same exponent @xmath202 of the average cycle length ; the decay exponent @xmath217 goes down with @xmath0 , even if very slowly : we found an exponent of @xmath218 for @xmath219 and @xmath220 for @xmath144 .",
    "this fact is in contradiction with the results of the annealed approximation , which predicts @xmath221 , but it is a direct consequence of the decrasing with time of the closing probability .    from our simulations on systems with @xmath181 and @xmath0 ranging from 30 to 90 and @xmath139 and @xmath0 ranging from 10 to 100",
    "it appears that the histogram of transient time has a peak corresponding to the time @xmath36 where the closing probability reaches its maximum value , and then decreases as a stretched exponential ; and the cycle length histogram decreases with the same law .",
    "in addition , very short periods are much more common respect to the others than one would expect on the basis of the annealed approximation ( see figure [ fig_pertrans ] ) .",
    "another unexpected feature of the period distribution is the fact that cycles of even lengths are more likely than odd ones , as one can already see by the fact that the closing probability is higher for even periods .",
    "we have seen in this fact a clue of a non trivial distribution of local periodes , say the period of a single element in a network .",
    "we have obtained in our simulations an indirect confirmation of this guess .",
    "we will present these data in a forecoming paper .",

    "the definition of the closing probabilities is crucial in this scheme .",
    "the annealed approximation , introduced by derrida and pomeau , has revealed to be a good tool for the computation of the closing probabilities and the approximate solution of the model .",
    "there are deviations from the approximation , which are larger close to the frozen phase , but the mean quantities that we computed are in good agreement with our numerical results .",
    "the annealed approximation works better in the chaotic phase , but it allows also to predict an universal behaviour of cycle lengths along the critical line .",
    "we have in plan to check this point .",
    "we havent , till now , tried to justify the approximation used . the annealed approximation allows to compute the overlap distribution using only a minimal information about the past evolution of the system and neglecting everything else , so we think that a loss of memory of the history of the system is needed for its validity .",
    "this fact is consistent with our numerical results , which show that the overlap of two configurations very far apart along the trajectory is in some sense \" more annealed  than the overlap of two configurations temporally closer .",
    "how this loss of memory comes about and what are its limitations would be an interesting question to address to understand in a more analytical way dynamical systems with quenched disorder .    as we saw in the previous section , the main discrepancies between our simulations and the annealed approximation arise from the fact that the closing probabilities ultimately decrease in time .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as a consequence of the definition of the closing probabilities as conditional probabilities : the requirement to consider only trajectories not yet closed selects , from a time on , trajectories where the typical overlaps are smaller and smaller .",
    "we did not impose the opening condition in our computation , so we think that the best way to improve the annealed approximation would be to take into account the opening of the trajectory in the computation .",
    "this purpose requires to keep memory of much more information about the past history of the trajectory than the simple one that we used in doing the annealed computation .",
