    "for some years , the theory of inflation @xcite has represented our most successful approach to the very early universe .",
    "although we do not know with certainty what physical conditions applied in the very distant past , it is believed that a number of fundamental properties of our universe were determined at that time . among the most important of these",
    "is the ensemble of small density perturbations which later condensed into galaxies and gave rise to the network of cosmic structure we see today .",
    "therefore , one question which must be answered by any theory which purports to describe the very early universe concerns the origin and nature of these perturbations . in inflationary models ,",
    "the answer is provided by use of an era of quasi - exponential expansion to generate small fluctuations from the vacuum .",
    "remarkably , the properties of these perturbations can be calculated by applying a minimal extension of quantum field theory to the expanding universe @xcite .",
    "the inflationary perturbations are generated by quantum - mechanical effects among field modes of wavelength @xmath0 around the time when such modes are of order the hubble scale , that is , @xmath1 . if the inflationary expansion is still ongoing when these perturbations are generated then the local hubble scale continues to contract , so that eventually they are far outside the horizon , giving @xmath2 . in this regime",
    "the field behaves in an approximately classical fashion @xcite .",
    "therefore the evolution of the curvature perturbation can be calculated reliably until the end of inflation , when it is generally assumed to settle down to a time - independent final value , unless isocurvature modes exist which drive its evolution on large scales @xcite . in this simple picture",
    "we have a robust prediction of the properties of the perturbations regardless of the details of the inflationary era .",
    "the above account neglects at least one possible source of trouble , namely the question of quantum mechanical corrections . in any quantum theory , including inflation , we are obliged to study the role of so - called _ loop corrections _ , which may modify or destroy the leading semiclassical prediction .",
    "loop corrections are systematic corrections in powers of a coupling constant , which is small if perturbation theory is to be a good approximation .",
    "however , perturbation series are generally asymptotic rather than convergent , and if the coefficients of higher - order terms are large then such corrections need not negligible even if the coupling constant is small . in such circumstances",
    ", these corrections must be taken into account when performing accurate comparisons of theory with observational data ; for example , their use is routine when interpreting the outcome of particle physics experiments .",
    "modern cosmological datasets have become remarkably precise @xcite , and observational improvements imply that future datasets will possess even greater constraining power .",
    "it is important that our theoretical predictions keep pace with observational developments .",
    "for this reason , as in particle physics , we should ask whether loop corrections can modify the predictions we use to compare with experiment .",
    "if such corrections are to play a role , what form should we expect them to take ? models of inflation make predictions concerning the properties of the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath3 .",
    "this perturbation is communicated to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at decoupling .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath3 are predicted by supposing that the universe is geometrically close to a patch of the classical , eternal de sitter universe , in which the expansion is exactly exponential .",
    "the de sitter universe has a special simplicity as a solution of the einstein equations since it is maximally symmetric , implying that its curvature is constant .",
    "however , as an arena for physics the de sitter universe is considerably less simple @xcite .",
    "a horizon surrounds any freely falling observer and screens a portion of the spacetime from view .",
    "this horizon is associated with a finite entropy , @xmath4 , which can be thought of as representing a finite state space of size @xmath5 available to each inertial observer .",
    "one therefore expects that perturbative predictions made over a volume @xmath6 ( in planck units ) are untrustworthy , since the volume @xmath7 carries more perturbative degrees of freedom than can actually be available in the full quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "an inflationary epoch lasting for @xmath8 e - folds causes the universe to expand by a factor @xmath9 , so we expect that the inflationary era can not be described in perturbation theory for an arbitrarily long time ; in order not to violate the volume bound , it is necessary that @xmath10 for reliable calculations .",
    "related limits on @xmath8 of various sorts have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the above intuitive argument implies that we should expect the coefficients in the loop expansion to become large when @xmath11 . for sufficiently large @xmath8",
    ", we will have a breakdown of perturbation theory and thus an apparent loss of predictivity from the early universe .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore the details of this loss of predictivity , quantified as a loop correction to the observable perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "although a proper understanding of the breakdown of perturbation theory is important as a matter of principle , it is also important in practice .",
    "the apparent success of the inflationary prediction means that it has become routine for experiments which measure temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background to report their findings in terms of constraints on inflationary models .",
    "these constraints are usually derived using tree - level predictions for @xmath3 which ignore the possibility of a breakdown in perturbation theory .",
    "the important ramifications which attach to a failure of the perturbative description mean that loop corrections have received attention from many authors , beginning with t hooft & veltman @xcite .",
    "the possibility of an infrared perturbative breakdown was explored by sasaki , suzuki , yamamoto & yokoyama @xcite , and later authors computed loop corrections in a variety of different settings ; for example , refs .",
    "we will derive an estimate for the loop correction for an arbitrary potential , using the slow - roll approximation to control the calculation .",
    "a central feature of this analysis is the use of the non - linear @xmath12 expansion @xcite .",
    "this expansion provides a systematic method for computing the evolution of @xmath3 ( and its correlation functions ) in terms of the field perturbations at earlier times ( and their correlation functions ) .",
    "moreover , as will be described below , the @xmath12 formulation has many useful properties for the purposes of loop calculations . in order to apply this method consistently ,",
    "it is necessary to account for the presence of loop corrections in the field perturbations at early times .",
    "the requisite loop correction has recently been calculated @xcite , and in this paper all these corrections are assembled into a loop correction for @xmath3 , which allows an estimate of the onset of any breakdown in perturbation theory in a number of popular models of inflation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : deltan ] the non - linear @xmath12 formula is briefly reviewed , and in  [ sec : oneloop ] it is used to derive the complete one - loop correction to the power spectrum of @xmath3 . our result agrees with that of byrnes _",
    "et al . _ , who recently gave an expression for the loop correction valid to two loops .",
    "a feature of the @xmath12 expansion is that one is free to construct the initial hypersurface at any time after the relevant @xmath13-modes have left the horizon .",
    "this freedom is discussed in  [ sec : slice ] . in  [ sec : rg - power ] we use the formal @xmath12 expression to compute an estimate for the loop correction .",
    "the loop correction is shown to be divergent on large scales in  [ sec : rg - log ] , and must be regularized by restricting the computation to some finite box of size @xmath14 . in   [ sec : constant - tilt][sec : monomials ] estimates for the regularized loop correction are given in two approximations . in  [ sec : constant - tilt ] the spectrum is assumed to be defined by a constant tilt , whereas in  [ sec : monomials ] we specialise to the case of a monomial potential and compute an explicit , but model - dependent , estimate .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of these results in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we use natural units in which the speed of light @xmath15 , planck s constant @xmath16 and the planck mass @xmath17 are set equal to unity .",
    "the metric signature is @xmath18 and the unperturbed background metric is taken to be of friedmann  robertson  walker form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is cosmic time and @xmath21 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "it is often more convenient to use a conformal time variable , @xmath22 , defined by @xmath23 .",
    "the hubble parameter satisfies @xmath24 , where an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath20 , and inflation occurs whenever @xmath25 .",
    "our theory will consist of einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field @xmath26 with potential @xmath27 ) , which can be arbitrary except that it must support an epoch of inflation for some values of the field .",
    "the background is taken to be homogeneous with spatially - dependent perturbations @xmath28 which satisfy the smallness condition @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 , the field @xmath26 rolls only a short distance in a hubble time , and therefore this is known as the slow - roll regime . when slow - roll applies , it is often a good formal approximation to compute in powers of @xmath31 or related small quantities obtained by taking dimensionless time derivatives of @xmath31 , although a key theme of this paper will be that such expansions are usually asymptotic rather than convergent .",
    "the most important related parameter is @xmath22 , not to be confused with the conformal time , and defined by @xmath32 .",
    "this measures the local curvature in the potential @xmath7 , and in typical models it is small whenever @xmath31 is , although this need not be true in general .",
    "our theories which govern cosmological evolution at high energies are typically written in terms of a number of microscopic fields whose quanta are the particle species which populate the universe .",
    "the interesting cosmological observables are expectation values of products of these fields , often in the special case where the fields which participate in the expectation value are evaluated at equal times but at distinct spatial positions @xmath33 .",

    "how are we to assign an interpretation to the notion of mean expansion ?",
    "this is necessary to determine what question we actually answer when we compute properties of @xmath3 using the @xmath12 formula .",
    "it corresponds to specifying which region of the universe is supposed to be described by the unperturbed background metric  . in practice",
    ", we do not imagine that the inflationary patch which gave rise to the large flat region we observe today fills our entire spatial slice .",
    "for example , this may happen because the universe emerged from some primeval phase with initial conditions which were chaotically varying , and the requirements for successful inflation were only realised at a fraction of spatial positions .",
    "arguments of this sort are invoked for chaotic inflationary models , and arise in a similar way for cosmologies based on the so - called `` landscape '' of string theory vacua . in such scenarios we should expect spacetime to retain a disordered , inhomogeneous and anisotropic character beyond the boundary of the inflationary patch .    it is quite clear that we should only associate the frw background metric   with the region of spacetime containing the primordial inflationary patch , perhaps after a few e - foldings of inflation so that the patch is sufficiently close to spatial flatness and isotropy @xcite .",
    "one then expects that whatever primordial unpleasantness lurks beyond the boundary is irrelevant when we make predictions from inflation , provided we live sufficiently far from the boundary .",
    "this is analogous to the decoupling theorem in field theory ( see , _ eg .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from the simple point of principle , related to cluster decomposition , that in order to make a prediction at one point we should not need to know the disposition of the universe at some far distant location .    in practice this means that @xmath88 should be interpreted as providing only an effective description within some box which coincides with the inflationary patch .",
    "but we are quite free , if we wish , to imagine that we are working within some smaller box , as long as it is large enough to contain scales of order the present horizon size .",
    "whichever box size we pick , @xmath3 represents the modulation in local expansion as one varies one s location within the box .",
    "do the answers to calculations depend on the box size ? certainly .",
    "in fact , @xmath88 will generally shift in value between differently sized boxes @xcite , because the split between background and perturbations is different on disparate scales .",
    "one can obtain the correct variation in @xmath88 by demanding that the expectation value of @xmath3 vanish within the box , that is , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 represents the spatial expectation value within a box of characteristic size @xmath14 .",
    "this process , which determines the physical perturbation mode within the box , is analogous to imposing a renormalization condition which determines a physical property of a particle , such as its mass .",
    "this @xmath14-dependence of @xmath88 and @xmath3 imply that one is left with predictions for the properties of @xmath3 which depend on the box size , @xmath14 . as emphasized by boubekeur & lyth",
    ", one can aggregate predictions in boxes of size @xmath14 into larger boxes of size @xmath91 in such a way that the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath14 is cancelled by the variation of background quantities @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to renormalization group invariance in field theory",
    ". nevertheless , the statistical properties of @xmath3 itself depend on @xmath14 . at first sight which seems like a failure of locality .",
    "the resolution is that if the properties of @xmath3 calculated within a small box are accessible to experiment , the properties of @xmath3 calculated some much larger box are not , because they require measurements to be made on scales which are larger than our present horizon . in order to make predictions for the cmb , we wish @xmath3 to represent the perturbation which is actually present in the radiation when the universe becomes transparent",
    "this entails making an optimal choice for @xmath14 in the same way that making a prediction for a scattering experiment at some characteristic momentum transfer entails making an optimal choice for the running coupling constant .    in what follows",
    "we compute the loop correction in @xmath92 .",
    "this will enable us to discuss the @xmath14-dependence of the prediction , and select an appropriate box size for the purposes of cmb predictions .",
    "in this section , we compute the formal @xmath12 expression for the one - loop correction to @xmath93 .",
    "this expression will turn out to be divergent and will require , as outlined in  [ sec : deltan ] above . in order to organize the calculation , it is convenient to express the various contributions to @xmath3 using a set of graphical rules , analogous to the feynman diagrams of quantum field theory .",
    "similar diagrams were introduced by crocce & scoccimarro @xcite and adapted for use in the present context by zaballa , rodrguez & lyth @xcite .",

    "therefore , in order to compute reliably with a slow - roll truncated q - loop such as eq .",
    "one should pick the point of evaluation in such a way that large logarithmic terms do not appear .",
    "this means that the initial hypersurface on which we base the @xmath12 expansion should be close to the horizon crossing hypersurface .",
    "the slow - roll expansion is then safe between these two hypersurfaces , and we can compute the q - loop to very good accuracy by assuming it is dominated by the leading slow - roll part of the first diagram .",
    "for the two - point function this difficulty is not severe , since for moderate values of @xmath156 one can account for the contribution of the second diagram , together with the subleading part of the first . however , for higher - order correlation functions this may become a practical consideration",

    "@xcite and the present paper on the one hand and the conclusions of martineau & brandenberger @xcite on the other arises because in ref .",
    "@xcite the random distribution of phases present in the inflationary perturbations caused an overall cancellation of the effect .",
    "in the present formalism the distribution of phases is invisible ; only the spectrum is relevant , not the modes themselves , and the large effect described in table  [ table : constraints ] is effectively the phase - space volume divergence given in eq .  (",
    "46 ) of martineau & brandenberger @xcite .",
    "in this paper , the @xmath12 formalism has been used to estimate the magnitude of the one - loop correction to the inflationary power spectrum in the case of a single - field , slow - roll model of the inflationary epoch .",
    "the calculation can be split into two separate parts .",
    "the first depends on a detailed estimate of the one - loop correction generated by interference among quantized field modes around the time of horizon crossing .",
    "this calculation has recently been performed in ref .",
    "the second measures the pile - up of field modes outside the horizon which are generated by the quasi - de sitter expansion .",
    "this accumulation of modes as inflation proceeds gives an ever - larger phase space for infrared divergences @xcite , which is measured by the so - called c - loops of the @xmath12 formalism . in this paper these two parts are assembled , allowing an estimate of the magnitude of the loop correction which includes all relevant effects .",
    "the results is entirely consistent with our expectations from flat space quantum field theory : we are free to formulate the fundamental microscopic theory which governs inflation at any energy scale we wish , but if we choose to formulate it at an energy scale which is wildly different from that of the phenomena we wish to observe , then we must expect significant corrections to be generated by loop effects .",
    "such corrections take the form of large logarithms that violate the predictions of nave dimensional analysis . in the present case",
    "the loop correction is given by eqs .",
    " , the fundmental theory is formulated at a scale @xmath14 , and we wish to predict phenomena associated with the cmb at a scale @xmath179 . the large logarithm which gives a significant loop correction is @xmath247 .",
    "if @xmath248 is exponentially large , which occurs in monomial models of inflation if initial conditions are set at around the planck scale , then the loop correction has a sensitivity to the tilt of the field perturbation power spectrum . the @xmath12 loop from the convolution of two power spectra is the most sensitive and scales like @xmath249 ; the @xmath12 loop from any intrinsic non - gaussianity among the @xmath235",
    "is suppressed , because @xmath44 scales in the opposite direction , giving @xmath250 . in the case of a negative tilt , which produces perturbations of increasing amplitude on _ large _ scales ,",
    "the loop correction rapidly becomes very significant .",
    "the correction is irrelevant only if inflation lasts for a small number of e - folds .    the physical effect which demands that loop corrections be taken into account is nothing more than back reaction .",
    "long ago , salopek & bond @xcite used the stochastic formalism to show that any initially homogeneous background field would develop wild fluctuations on ultra - large scales as inflation progressed . the large loop correction encountered in the limit of a large box",
    "is another manifestation of this effect .",
    "it measures the dispersion generated by comparing a correlator calculated in one region of the universe with the same correlator calculated in a different region , perhaps where the background fields have very different values .",
    "the correlator calculated in the large box is therefore not measureable in any experiment : it involves comparing the cmb temperature which would be seen in an ensemble of different universes , and no physical observer can make such a comparison .",
    "for this reason , the correlation is a `` computable '' in the sense of witten @xcite , but is not an observable .",
    "this result has no consequences for how we make or report cosmological observations , but has very significant consequences for how such observations are compared with theoretical models . in models where",
    "the fundamental theory is not taken to be valid within an exponentially large region , we are entitled to entirely disregard the question of loop corrections , since in this case they yield a negligible shift in tree - level values .",
    "this class of models includes the familiar single - field examples where inflation ends when the field reaches a certain point on its potential . in such cases",
    "we know the conditions which lead to the end of inflation and we always have the option to work within a small box .",
    "on the other hand , where isocurvature fields are present , these fields will generally acquire large fluctuations within the inflating region .",
    "if these fields play a role in ending inflation , then we may lose the option to compute within a small box , whereas the correlator within a large box may be afflicted with large loop corrections .",
    "this problem is perhaps most severe precisely for those models to which we presently attach the greatest interest ",
    "those motivated from fundamental particle physics . for example , one popular class of such models arise from the so - called landscape of string vacua @xcite . in such models ,",
    "one imagines the unwanted six dimensions predicted by string theory to be wrapped up on a calabi  yau three - fold which may be topologically quite non - trivial , as measured by the existence of a large number of homological cycles .",
    "these cycles can be wrapped by fluxes of @xmath251-form fields , giving rise to regions of the three - fold which have different values for the cosmological constant @xmath252 , together with the other constants of nature @xcite , and in general many scalar fields will be present which measure the size and shape of the calabi  yau three - fold .",
    "these different regions may exhibit substantially different low - energy physics .",
    "in such models , the natural scale at which one computes the masses and couplings in the low - energy theory would be the planck scale , or perhaps the self - reproduction scale of eternal inflation .",
    " show that to compare any such theory to observation , one must account for large loop corrections which are inevitably encountered in passing from the planck scale to the scale relevant for cmb predictions .",
    "this has some implications for how large - field models of inflation are compared with cmb observations . to understand how the planck scale theory is related to the theory when scales associated with the cmb exited the horizon",
    ", one would need to integrate out the relevant degrees of freedom between @xmath253 and the cmb scale .",
    "by analogy with conventional field theory , as one changes scale the effective lagrangian should be controlled by a flow equation analogous to polchinksi s exact renormalization group equation @xcite . in flat space theory",
    "this flow has well - understood effects , attracting the lagrangian to an invariant hypersurface on which non - renormalizable couplings are suppressed .",
    "( this would refer to the effective field theory for @xmath3 , not to the couplings in the matter theory . )",
    "unfortunately a complete understanding of this process in the cosmological case is not yet in hand , and it does not appear to be understood precisely how the planck scale theory will be related to the theory in a small box .",
    "one possible approach is to use the method of salopek & bond @xcite , who gave a fokker ",
    "planck equation which determined the probability distribution of the classical fields on large scales .",
    "having done so , it is possible to use a small box to determine the value of the correlation functions at each value of the allowed background fields , but one is then restricted to making probabilistic statements concerning what should be observed in the cmb .",
    "this issue deserves further study .    in any case , considerable work remains to be done .",
    "the present analysis should be generalized to the case of multiple scalar fields in order that it can be applied to the best - motivated models from fundamental physics .",
    "this involves an extension of the q - loop calculation given in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of many scalar fields .",
    "the calculation given by weinberg  @xcite shows that where @xmath3 is accompanied by @xmath254 isocurvature fields , we can expect the @xmath3 loop to receive an enhancement by a factor @xmath255 .",
    "however , in a multiple field scenario a more involved process is required to estimate @xmath256 @xcite , since the growth of @xmath39 on superhorizon scales is no longer simple to predict .",
    "these issues should be addressed with some urgency .",
