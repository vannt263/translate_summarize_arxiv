    "searching for the similarity and the unifying principles in the description of the variety of the thermodynamical properties of complex matter is the key point of statistical physics .",
    "one of the most known is the principle ( theorem ) of corresponding states ( pcs ) which goes back to van der waals @xcite .",
    "of course this law is approximate because of the difference in intermolecular forces for different substances .",
    "strictly speaking the pcs is applicable only to the substances which have similar interparticle potentials @xcite .",
    "moreover the pcs is pure classical since it is based on the continuous scaling of the characteristic of the interparticle potential .",
    "the quantum effects which lead to the discrete number of the energetic levels in the potential well lead to the deviation from this law even for heavy noble gases @xcite .",
    "in such a case the search of the universal relations which applicable to broad class of substances is of great importance .",
    "well - known the rectilinear diameter law ( rdl ) @xcite for the density as the order parameter of the phase coexistence : @xmath1 is one of the examples .",
    "although the relation is also approximate it is observed for a wide variety of fluids in a surprisingly broad temperature interval beyond the critical region where the critical fluctuations lead to the appearance of the non analytic corrections @xcite ( for the recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "another typical phenomenological batchinsky law was derived from the van der waals equation@xcite .",
    "it states that the curve defined by the equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the compressibility factor , is a straight line which can be described by simple equation on @xmath4-plane : @xmath5 the temperature @xmath6 corresponds to the boyle point @xcite and @xmath7 is the value of the density obtained by the extrapolating the coexistence curve into the low temperature region beyond triple point @xcite . in work of ben - amotz and herschbach @xcite the line @xmath2",
    "is called by the zeno - line ( zl ) .",
    "they also noted the striking correlation between two remarkable linearities and .",
    "these findings have been further developed in works of apfelbaum _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and successfully applied for the prediction of the critical points of high - temperature metals @xcite .",
    "two main empirical facts discovered in these works are very important .",
    "the first one is the fact that the zl tends asymptotically to the liquid branch of binodal at low temperatures .",
    "the second fact is that the corresponding median asymptotically close to the rectilinear diameter at @xmath8 .",
    "these facts allow to formulate the conception of the  triangle of liquid - gas states  @xcite .",
    "the authors also claimed that the rdl can be considered as the consequence of the linear dependence of the zeno line at low temperatures .",
    "the aim of this work is to propose simple geometrical interpretation which naturally explains the linearities and as the consequence of ( approximate ) isomorphism of the real fluids with the lattice gas .",
    "the geometrical fact that the zl is the tangent to the coexistence curve allows to state that there is global isomorphism between the phase diagram of the lattice gas ( lg ) or equivalently the ising model and the liquid - gas part of the diagram of the simple fluid with the coexistence region extrapolated in the region @xmath8 .",
    "the phase diagram of the lg is remarkably symmetrical ( see [ fig_zeno_tri ] ) .",
    "this is the reflection of the particle - hole symmetry which in real fluids is absent due to finite size of the particles and the infinite repulsive potential at small distances @xcite .",
    "in particular the specific shape of the particles influences the equation of state @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the lattice gas is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy of the site - site interaction of the nearest sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the chemical potential .",
    "this hamiltonian is trivially isomorphic to the hamiltonian of the ising model of interacting spins @xmath14 via the transformation @xmath15 so that @xmath16 whether the site is empty or occupied correspondingly .",
    "the order parameter is the probability of occupation @xmath17 and serves as the analog of the density .",
    "indeed there are two specific elements which determine the structure of the liquid - gas part of the phase diagram .",
    "the first one is the coexistence line which is terminated by the second element - the critical point ( cp ) .",
    "the comparison of the phase diagram of the lg and the real fluid shows that they are topologically isomorphic .",
    "therefore the one - to - one correspondence between the basic elements can be given ( see [ fig_zeno_tri ] ) . moreover taking into account the linearities of the characteristic elements like diameter of the binodal and the zeno - line such isomorphism can be chosen in the simplest form of the projective mapping since it conserves the incident and tangential relations between the corresponding linear elements .",
    "moreover the transformation of such class is unique because any projective transformation is determined by the correspondence between two triplets of three nonconcurrent lines @xcite . in our case",
    "we choose the following triplets the critical isotherms , the zeno - lines and the zeno - medians : @xmath18 as a sequence the binodal of the lg is mapped onto binodal of the real fluid . thus the projective nature is based on the fact that the zl must be tangential to the extension of the liquid branch of the binodal in low temperature region stated in @xcite .    ) . the zeno - line @xmath0 and the zeno - median",
    "are shown .",
    "the latter coincides with the diameter of the binodal . ]    basing on the consideration above we can find the corresponding projective transformation between @xmath19 and @xmath4 planes which maps these configurations onto each other .",
    "this transformation has the following general form ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath20 taking into account the correspondence between the coordinate axes : @xmath21 e can put @xmath22 .",
    "finally we can write : @xmath23 where the parameter @xmath24 can be derived from the correspondence between the critical points @xmath25 .",
    "elementary algebra gives : @xmath26 it is easy to verify that the triples maps onto each other .",
    "obviously the value of @xmath27 is determined by the interparticle potential .",
    "note that the boyle temperature @xmath6 of the real fluid corresponds to the physically unreachable state with @xmath28 for the lattice gas .",
    "this reflects the fact that two particles of the lg can not occupy the same site because this is the prohibited configuration ( occupation number @xmath29 is either 0 or 1 ) .",
    "additional argument comes from the consideration of the second virial coefficient .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 is determined by the balance between repulsive and attractive contributions into the second virial coefficient @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the diameter of the hard core , @xmath33 - the potential of the long range attractive part of the interaction . from this consideration",
    "it is clear that for point like particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 in accordance with .",
    "taking into account that the lattice gas cp @xmath36 maps onto the cp of real fluid @xmath37 from it is easy to get the value of the asymptotic density @xmath7 : @xmath38 this relation is the direct consequence of the proposed isomorphism and can be verified using the experimental data .",
    "in particular it is known that for many substances the approximate relation @xmath39 is valid .",
    "then from we get : @xmath40 below we show how , follow directly from the augmented by the scaling properties of the lg model . also within such geometrical approach",
    "we can derive the linearity of the critical points line which was obtained in @xcite by the consideration of the binodals of the liquids in reduced coordinates @xmath41 .",
    "indeed different molecular fluids are described by the different scales for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for the corresponding lattice gas models it means that their parameters also scales in the same way .",
    "basing on the structure of the lg hamiltonian we can state that the phase diagram of the lg is invariant under the scale transformation @xmath44 as the lg temperature parameter @xmath45 is proportional to the interaction constant @xmath10 .",
    "note that this scale symmetry correlates exactly with the lenard - jones ( lj ) potential where the leading interaction is of van der waals nature @xmath46 . omitting the influence of the repulsive part",
    "we get the same result since @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the average interparticle distance at the cp . from here",
    "it follows that @xmath50 is invariant under the scale transformation similar to .",
    "of course this is nothing but the pcs for the lj fluids which can be easily extended to other interaction potentials which have the scale invariant properties @xcite .",
    "+    the spatial scale in lg is determined by the state for which @xmath51 where the lattice of particles without the hole defects is formed .",
    "this corresponds to the asymptotic state of the infinite density @xmath52 . in the real fluid",
    "the cavities are always present . the relations together with the projective isomorphism lead to the fact that the point @xmath53 of intersection of the line @xmath54 with the zeno - line @xmath51 of the lg determines the fixed point of the scale transformation . since the point @xmath55 of @xmath19-plane maps into infinite point , then becomes as the following : @xmath56 from the empirical equalities : @xmath57 follow directly .",
    "they have been used above as the empirical facts ( see ) . under the infinitesimal transformation of the scale the locus of the lattice - gas cp shifts along the line : @xmath58 which connects the points @xmath59 and @xmath55 on the lg plane .",
    "also , the line transforms into the line of the critical points on @xmath4 plane : @xmath60 this situation is shown on [ fig_cpshift ] . note that perfectly corresponds with the equation of the critical points line : @xmath61 obtained in @xcite basing on the lj model ",
    "_ as the most consecutive one and the one closest to the real substances _  .",
    "so we can conclude that the fact that the value of the parameter @xmath24 is close to @xmath62 reflects the scale invariance property of the  @xmath63  attractive part of the lj potential similar to that for the lg hamiltonian .",
    "for the real substances the parameter @xmath24 depends on the repulsive part also so that @xmath64 is no more valid . in such a case",
    "the general form of the cp line is : @xmath65 nevertheless for many substances the value of @xmath24 is close to @xmath62 and correspondingly the estimates are quite good .",
    "this allows to give the classical principle of corresponding states new formulation using the proposed approach .",
    "we have shown that all the empirical relations about the linearity of the zeno - line and the rectilinear diameter can casted into geometrical form .",
    "the proposed geometrical picture allows to get the unifying view on the empirical relations obtained in @xcite .",
    "such geometrical interpretation is based on the essential similarity of the lj liquid isomorphism and scaling symmetry for the hamiltonians of the lg and the lj fluids .    in conclusion",
    "we discuss the range of validity of the proposed isomorphism .",
    "of course the proposed isomorphism is approximate just like the pcs .",
    "nevertheless it provides the useful zeroth approximation for the estimates of the corresponding properties of the real substances @xcite .",
    "the range of the validity for such simple projective isomorphism is based on the conservation of the essential features of the lg .",
    "they are ( a ) independence of the interaction on the thermodynamical state ; ( b ) the absence of the formation of the additional structures in liquids , e.g. polymerization , h - bond network etc . from this point of view",
    "it is expected that the linear character of both the zeno - line and the rectilinear diameter rely on the lj character of the interparticle interactions .",
    "this correlates with the known facts that the rdl and the linearity of the zeno - line are violated in liquid metals metals @xcite and water @xcite .",
    "also the triple point which exists in real fluids and is absent for lg leads to the deviation of the isomorphism from the simple form of the projective transformation .",
    "indeed the zeno - line is defined as the tangent to the binodal in the physical inaccessible region of @xmath8 and must correctly describe the low - temperature part of the binodal @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to elaborate the extension of the proposed approach taking into account the existence of the triple point which bounds the coexistence line at finite densities .",
    "the growth of the fluctuations in the vicinity of the cp is responsible for the deviation from the linearities which specified by the projective mapping .",
    "the latter is nonlinear and therefore @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the statistical average . in particular , in the vicinity of the cp the rectilinear diameter deviates from the simple linear law and shows anomalies @xcite .",
    "because of this the zeno - median does not coincide with the diameter and approaches it only asymptotically far away from the cp @xcite",
    ".    such deviations could give the support to search the isomorphism on the basis of the initial statistical local fields like in the approach proposed @xcite rather than the nonlinear transformation of the thermodynamic averages only @xcite ."
