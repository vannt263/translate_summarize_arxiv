    "qso absorption line systems probe the baryonic matter over most of the history of the universe ( 0  @xmath10  @xmath11  @xmath12  5 ) .",
    "the so - called damped ly@xmath13 ( hereafter dla ) systems are characterized by a very large h  i column density ( @xmath4(h   i )  @xmath14  2@xmath1510@xmath6  @xmath7 ) , similar to the one usually seen in local spiral disks .",
    "such systems at large redshift ( @xmath11  @xmath5  23 ) are thought to be produced by proto - galactic disks .",
    "the main argument in favor of this conclusion is that the cosmological density of gas associated with these systems is of the same order of magnitude as the cosmological density of stars at present epochs ( wolfe 1996 ) .",
    "moreover they present a metallicity @xmath16 ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) , while strong metal line systems have been demonstrated to be associated with galaxies at low and intermediate @xmath11 ( e.g. bergeron & boiss 1991 ) .",
    "the detailed study of low-@xmath11 dla systems is thus crucial as information can be gathered both on the absorbing gas via optical and uv spectroscopy ( kinematics , ionization state ) and the associated galaxy ( impact parameter , morphology , star formation activity ) .",
    "however very few dla systems are known at low-@xmath11 ( lanzetta et al . 1995 , rao et al . 1995 ) .",
    "moreover identifying the galaxy associated with low-@xmath11 dla systems is not easy as it often lies very close to the quasar ( steidel et al .",
    "1994 ) . indeed , using _",
    "high spatial resolution images of the field of seven quasars whose spectra present dla lines at intermediate redshifts ( 0.4  @xmath12  @xmath11  @xmath12  1 ) , le  brun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that , in all cases , at least one galaxy candidate is present within 4  arcsec from the quasar , the closest being at @xmath50.75  arcsec .",
    "there is no dominant morphological type in their sample : three candidates are spiral galaxies , three are compact objects and two are amorphous low surface brightness galaxies .    here , we report on the detection of a galaxy projected at 4.2  arcsec ( or 5.2  @xmath1  kpc for @xmath2  =  0.5 at @xmath11  =  0.101 ) from the quasar q  0459433 .",
    "the galaxy has the same redshift as a strong fe  ii - mg  ii - c  iv metal line system detected in _ hst - fos _ spectra .",
    "b , v , r and i broad - band images of the rich field around q  0439433 and spectra of the qso and galaxy were obtained on 20 and 22 february 1996 , with emmi mounted on the ntt .",
    "1 shows the b - band image after flat - fielding and flux - calibration .",
    "the scale is given by a tick mark of size 10  arcsec .",
    "the quasar is marked with an arrow ; a galaxy is seen 4.2  arcsec north of it .",
    "b , v , r and i magnitudes for the quasar and the galaxy are 17.21 , 16.84 , 16.75 , 16.44 and 18.76 , 17.74 , 17.24 , 16.74 respectively with an error of 0.05 magnitude .",
    "the galaxy luminosity is thus @xmath17 .",
    "its inclination measured on the r and i images is @xmath18 assuming this is a spiral galaxy .",
    "mg  ii@xmath192797 , [ ne  v]@xmath193426 , [ o   ii]@xmath193727 and [ ne  iii]@xmath193869 emission lines from the quasar are detected at a mean redshift of @xmath20  @xmath21  0.594 .",
    "the galaxy spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "2 . it presents a spatially resolved emission line with @xmath22   at @xmath195353.08 ( on top of a broad absorption feature ) , identified as h@xmath23 at @xmath0  =  0.1012 ; this value is confirmed by the presence of the mg  i absorption blend and the ca  +  fe e absorption band at 5700.3 and 5800.9     for a redshift of 0.1014 and 0.1009 respectively .",
    "the infrared observations were carried out on 27 - 28 january 1995 , with the eso irac2b camera ( moorwood et al .",
    "1992 ) mounted on the 2.2  m telescope .",
    "the detector is a 256@xmath15256 nicmos3 array .",
    "we used lens c in the k and j ",
    "bands with a resolution of 0.52  arcsec per pixel .",
    "the seeing was typically 1  arcsec or slightly better .",
    "every 2  min , we moved the object on the array by about 10  arcsec .",
    "the image of the sky has then been obtained by median - filtering all the images .",
    "each image has then been dark - subtracted and flat - fielded using the normalized sky - image .",
    "accurate registration is obtained by determining the peak of the 2d correlation function between images .",
    "the total integration time is 100  min in k and 25  min in j. the final result is displayed in fig .",
    "the magnitudes of the quasar and the galaxy in j and k are 16.1 , 14.5 and 16.2 , 14.7 respectively .",
    "spectroscopic observations of q  0439433 , yet unpublished , were accessed from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "the observations were made using the faint object spectrograph with the g190h grating ( over the wavelength range 16002300   , for a resolution of 1.35     fwhm ) and with the g270h grating ( over the wavelength range 22503250   , for a resolution of 1.92     fwhm ) .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard pipeline reduction techniques .",
    "the zero point of the wavelength scale was determined requiring that galactic interstellar absorptions occur at rest .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath24  =  0.101 system .",
    "table  1 gives the characteristics of the lines detected in this system ( observed wavelengths and equivalent widths , errors from the adjacent noise , identifications and corresponding redshifts ) .",
    "4 shows portions of the spectrum with the lines of interest .",
    "during the spectroscopic observation , the long - slit was oriented north - south and happened to intercept a faint object located 25.8  arcsec north of the quasar ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the spectrum presents an emission line at @xmath195161.3 .",
    "the identification with [ o   ii]@xmath193727 gives a redshift of @xmath0  =  0.3848 .",
    "there is no absorption line in the _ hst _ data at this redshift with a 3@xmath25 observed equivalent width limit of 0.3   .",
    "the projected distance between the object and the line of sight to the quasar is 324  @xmath26  kpc ( @xmath2  =  0.5 ) .",
    "this large distance is consistent with the idea that the metal line systems at intermediate redshift arise in galaxy halos with radius of the order of 35  @xmath26  kpc ( e.g. bergeron & boiss 1991 , steidel 1993 ) .",

    "the mean redshift is @xmath24  =  0.1010 .",

    "4 that the lines are blends of several components .",
    "given the limited resolution of the spectra , it is only possible to perform a rough decomposition .",

    "the ratio @xmath29(fe  ii@xmath192382)/@xmath29(mg  ii@xmath192796 ) @xmath5 0.6 indicates that the system is certainly of fairly high h  i column density ( @xmath4(h  i )  @xmath30  10@xmath31  @xmath7 , bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) .",
    "the detection of a strong mg  i@xmath192852 absorption line ( rest equivalent width @xmath32  =  0.26   ) further supports this conclusion .",

    "there is an absorption feature at @xmath192229.6 which we would normally not attribute to zn  ii@xmath192026 at @xmath11  =  0.101 because the wavelength discrepancy ( 120  km  s@xmath9 ) is slighly larger than the resolution .",
    "however the feature has a red wing that could be due to zn  ii , in which case we find log  @xmath4(zn  ii )  @xmath5  13.3 .",

    "the c  iv and mg  ii doublets are spread over @xmath5  150  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "however the velocity distribution of the gas is different in c  iv and mg  ii ( doppler parameters of 60  km  s@xmath9 were used to fit the c  iv lines ) as often observed in dla systems where mg  ii and c  iv are thought to probe galactic disks and haloes respectively ( e.g. turnshek et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the low ionization lines have equivalent width typical of the absorption lines produced by the milky way gas in the spectra of extra - galactic objects ( savage et al .",
    "however the c  iv lines are much stronger in the present system .",
    "moreover there is an additional c  iv system redshifted relative to the galaxy by about 1100  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "its origin is unclear but could be due to a companion .",
    "several candidates are present in the field within 35  arcsec ( or 45@xmath1  kpc , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "high resolution imaging of the field with _ hst _ is needed to investigate the morphology of the galaxy . indeed , although a faint spiral feature can be seen in the k-band and optical images",
    ", the morphology of the galaxy is unclear .",
    "the colours however are indicative of a spiral galaxy .",
    "it seems likely that the @xmath24  =  0.101 mg  ii - fe   ii - c  iv absorption system detected in the spectrum of q  0439 - 433 is a damped ly@xmath13 system of moderate column density ( @xmath4(h  i )  @xmath5  10@xmath6  @xmath7 ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the large @xmath32(fe  ii)/@xmath32(mg   ii )  @xmath5  0.6 equivalent width ratio , the presence of a strong mg  i absorption and strengths of the absorptions by low ionization species similar to what is observed for damped systems .",
    "the absorption in the x - ray spectrum of q  0439 - 433 corresponds to @xmath4(hi)@xmath38@xmath7 ( wilkes et al .",
    "1992 ) with a galactic contribution of @xmath39@xmath7 ( lockman & savage 1995 ) .",
