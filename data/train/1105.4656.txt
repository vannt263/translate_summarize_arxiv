    "the gaussian free field is commonly assumed to be a universal field describing the fluctuations of random surfaces appearing in a wide class of models in statistical physics .",
    "however , rigorous proofs are only known for some particular integrable models . for example , interesting progress has been made on dimer models on bipartite planar graphs ( see @xcite for a survey and a list of references ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study a random surface appearing in a stochastic growth model on a system of interlacing particles and show that its fluctuations are governed by the gaussian free field .",
    "this work is partially inspired by @xcite , where the authors introduced a general model in 2 + 1 dimensions that connects the random surfaces of the type that occur in the dimer models , with the random growth of particle systems on a one dimensional lattice ( e.g. exclusion processes ) .",
    "here we will discuss a particular specialization of that model .    in the initial configuration",
    "the particles are placed on the grid @xmath0 and are densely packed in a triangular region as shown in the left picture in figure  [ fig : init ] .",
    "each particle has an exponential clock and when the clock rings , the particle attempts to jump to the right by @xmath1 . to ensure that the interlacing of the particles on subsequent horizontal levels is preserved ,",
    "each attempted jump is subject to certain rules ( specified later on , but in short : each particle is blocked by the particles below , but pushes the particles above ) .",
    "the central feature of our model is the fact that we have two different types of particles : slow and fast .",
    "more precisely , we draw a horizontal separating line and equip the particles above that line with a higher jump rate than the particles below . as a consequence",
    "the particles above the separating line tend to move faster .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough analysis for the situation in which all particles have the same jump rate .",
    "[ fig : init ]    for large time , the particles will be distributed on a large domain that is shown in figure  [ fig : domains ] .",
    "see also figures  [ fig : confbefore ] and [ fig : confafter ] for sample configurations .",
    "there exists a critical time , after which the limiting domain develops a cusp .",
    "this means that after the critical time , there is a group of fast particles that is drifting away from the slower particles below the separating line , while other fast particles are held back by the slow particles below due to the jump rules .",
    "the latter situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : confafter ] and the right picture in figure  [ fig : domains ] .",
    "our main results on the long time behavior are expressed in terms of a height function that integrates the particle configuration .",
    "the graph of the height function defines the random surface that has our interest .",
    "we show that this height function has a deterministic shape in the large time limit .",
    "the difference in speed for the two types of particles induces a jump discontinuity in the normal to the limit shape at the line separating the slow and fast particles .    in order to describe the limit shape ,",
    "we introduce a bijection that maps the limiting domain to the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "this map constitutes a natural complex structure on the system .",
    "away from the separating line it satisfies the complex burgers equation ( for more details on the connection between this equation and limit shapes see @xcite ) . due to the different jump rates , the bijection in our case is only homeomorphism but not a diffeomorphism ( in contrast to the situations in for example @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of the paper is that the fluctuation of the pushforward of the random surface under this map are governed by the gaussian free field on the upper half plane .",
    "the limit shape is subject to a pde .",
    "away from the separating line , this pde brings our model _ locally _ in the 2d anisotropic kpz class @xcite ( see also @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this constitutes an important class of stochastic growth models . in @xcite , the author used non - rigorous arguments to show that the fluctuations in these models are similar to the fluctuations of random surfaces in the edwards - wilkinson class , which predicts the logarithmic behavior of the height fluctuations",
    "however , it does not predict the full result on the gaussian free field , especially in relation with the complex structure .",
    "the only model of this type ( that the author is aware of ) for which the gaussian free field in the fluctuations is rigorously proved , is the one jump rate situation analyzed in @xcite . in our situation",
    ", the pde has a jump discontinuity on the separating line .",
    "it is not a priori clear if and how this effects the fluctuations .",
    "for example , it is not obvious at first ( and perhaps slightly surprising ) , that the correlations of the fluctuations of the height function at a point in the slower part and at a point in the faster part that starts drifting away , are essentially of the same type as for points that are both in the slow part .",
    "the essence of our main result is that in all cases these correlations are given by the pullback of the green s function for the laplace operator on the upper half plane with dirichlet boundary conditions by the complex structure on the system .",
    "finally , we remark that in for example @xcite , the presence of the gaussian free field is established by computing the limiting behavior for the moments of the height fluctuations at multiple points . in this paper",
    ", we follow an alternative approach that exploits the determinantal structure of the process .    [ [ acknowledgements ] ] acknowledgements + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    i thank alexei borodin for drawing my attention to the subject of this paper and for many fruitful discussions .",
    "in this section we will state our main results .",
    "the proofs can be found in sections [ sec : newco]-[sec : asymptoticsr ] .",
    "let us start with describing the model .",
    "we consider dynamics on a system of interlacing particles placed on the grid @xmath0 . at each point in time , there are @xmath2 particles on the horizontal section @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the horizontal coordinate of the @xmath5-th particle ( counting from left to right ) on the @xmath2-th level by @xmath6 for @xmath7 . in the initial configuration at time @xmath8 the positions are @xmath9 as shown in the left picture of figure  [ fig : init ] .",
    "each particle has an exponential clock and when its clock rings , it attempts to jump to the right by one .",
    "however , we enforce the following interlacing condition to hold at all times @xmath10 to ensure that this interlacing condition holds , we impose the following rules . if the exponential clock of the particles positioned at @xmath6 rings then    1 .",
    "it remains put if @xmath11 .",
    "it jumps to the right by one and so do all particles with horizontal coordinate @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "hence a particle is blocked by particles that are below , but it pushes particles that lie above .    it remains to set the rate for the exponential clocks .",
    "the first @xmath14 horizontal levels have an exponential clock with rate @xmath1 , whereas the particles at the higher levels have rate @xmath15 .",
    "hence the particles at @xmath6 with @xmath16 will attempt to move faster in time .",
    "we are interested in the long time behavior of the system .",
    "the above model can also be established as a tiling of the half plane by lozenges @xcite .",
    "we proceed with an informal discussion on the long time behavior .",
    "precise statements are formulated in the next paragraph .    in figures  [ fig : confbefore ] and [ fig : confafter ] we give two particular sample configurations .",
    "as these figures suggest , for large time the particles fill a domain as given in figure  [ fig : domains ] .",
    "the slanted dashed line in figure  [ fig : domains ] represents the line @xmath17 .",
    "note that at all times , the particles are positioned at the right of that line .",
    "the horizontal dashed line is the line @xmath18 that separates the slow and fast particles . as a consequence to the different speeds of the particles ,",
    "there is a transition in the shape of the domain and the density as one crosses the line @xmath18 .",
    "the particles above that line tend to move faster than the particles below .",
    "due to the interlacing condition , the particles more to the left in the upper part of the system are held back by the particles in the lower part .",
    "the particles to the right move independently from the lower part .",
    "there is a critical time , after which particles more to the right in the upper part start forming a group that starts drifting away and a cusp appears in the domain .",
    "this is illustrated in the domain at the right in figure  [ fig : domains ] .",
    "although the focus to this paper is on the global scale and its fluctuations , it is also possible retrieve interesting universality classes at the local scale . as the proofs are standard and the results are not relevant to this paper , we content ourselves with a brief discussion . for points in the bulk , the local correlation are described by extensions of the discrete sine kernel that fall into the class described in @xcite .",
    "near the edge , we obtain extensions of the airy process ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the local correlations near the cusp are determined by the pearcey process @xcite . at the points where the domain touches the line @xmath17 , the horizontal axis and the line @xmath18 ( after the critical time ) , the local process is governed by the gue minor process @xcite .      to each particle configuration",
    "we assign a surface , which is the graph of the height function given in the following definition .",
    "we define the height function @xmath19 by @xmath20 in other words , @xmath21 counts the number of particles that are at the right of @xmath22 ( including the possible particle at @xmath22 ) .    for each configuration",
    ", the height function defines a stepped surface .",
    "our first result is an explicit description of the limit shape of the mean @xmath23 . to this end , we need the following definitions .    denote the upper half plane by @xmath24 define the function @xmath25 by @xmath26 for @xmath27 . to every @xmath28 there exists at most one @xmath29 such that @xmath30",

    "as in section [ sec : asymptoticsk ] , we deform the contours of integration to paths of steep(est ) descent / ascent for @xmath513 leaving from @xmath366 and @xmath514 ( for a discussion on these paths see section [ sec : asymptoticsk].1 ) . each time we deform one of the contours , we possibly pick up a residue due to the intersection with another contour . by repeating this a number of times we are left with several integrals ,",

    "whenever the integrand contains an exponential , the integral tends to @xmath70 as @xmath98 .",
    "there is only one integral that does not contain an exponential and this gives the main contribution and the right hand side of .",
    "now let us discuss this procedure in more detail for the case @xmath159 .",
    "the case @xmath498 follows by precisely the same arguments but with @xmath515 replaced by @xmath516 and vice versa . in case @xmath170 , the initial contours for @xmath147 are slightly different , but this does not lead to essentially new complications .",
    "we set @xmath159 and start with the contours as in figure  [ fig : quadr ] .",
    "let @xmath110 first be a very small contour around the origin and @xmath164 a very large contour close to infinity far away from the other contours . deform the contours @xmath495 and @xmath112 to paths of steep ( not necessarily steepest ) ascent leaving from @xmath375 and @xmath376 and their conjugates , such that they do not intersect with @xmath110 and @xmath164 ( yet ) . then deform the contours @xmath110 and @xmath164 to paths of steep descent leaving from @xmath375 and @xmath376 and their conjugates .",
    "by doing so , we pick up several residues , and are left with quadruple , triple and double integrals .",
    "in some of these integrals , we need additional deformations , but first we will collect the various terms that we obtained .    for illustration purposes ,",
    "let us also assume that for the deformed contours we still have that @xmath164 goes around @xmath110 and that @xmath112 goes around @xmath495 ( the other situations follow by similar arguments ) .",
    "see also the left picture in figure [ fig : quadrsteep ] , where @xmath376 is the top saddle point . in this case",
    "we are left with seven integrals : one quadruple integral ( the same as in but now over paths of steep ascent / descent ) , four triple integrals over contours that are indicated in figure  [ fig : finaltriple ] and two double integrals given in figure  [ fig : finaldouble ] .",
    "we discuss the seven integrals that are obtained in this way , starting with the double integrals in figure  [ fig : finaldouble ] .",

    "the double integral over the contours in left picture of figure  [ fig : finaldouble ] is given by @xmath518 where @xmath519 and @xmath520 are the point of intersection in the upper half plane of @xmath110 and @xmath112 , and the contours @xmath164 and @xmath495 respectively .",

    "we analyze the quadruple integral @xmath525 which is the same integral as in but now with deformed contours .",
    "since the deformed contours are of steep descent / ascent and the functions @xmath364 appear both the numerator and denominator , the integrand is bounded .",
    "in fact , the main contribution , comes from small neighborhoods around the saddle points . as in section 6.3",
    ", we introduce the local variables as in around the saddle points . for example , near @xmath375 and @xmath376 we introduce @xmath526 the scaling by @xmath527 in the local variable , implies that the integrals tend to zero as @xmath98 ( as was the case for the double integral for @xmath289 in ) .",
    "to this end , note that @xmath528 the sign depends on the choice of the square roots , but is irrelevant in this discussion .",
    "since by assumption the points @xmath375 and @xmath376 are sufficiently far apart and the fact that the right - hand side is integrable ( despite the singularities ) , we indeed see that the quadruple integral is of order @xmath529 as @xmath98 . moreover , the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of @xmath39 .",
    "we now come to the triple integrals presented in figure  [ fig : finaltriple ] .",
    "let us start with the top right case .",
    "in that situation the triple integral is given by @xmath530 the integral over the path from @xmath531 to @xmath376 can be explicitly computed .",
    "as for the integrals over @xmath110 and @xmath495 , the main contribution comes again from small neighborhoods near the saddle points . by introducing local variables as in and arguing as before , it is apparent that the integral vanishes as @xmath98 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath39 .",
    "the same can be done for the situation in the lower right picture .    for the triple integral over contours as in the top left picture of figure  [ fig : finaltriple ] we have @xmath532 in this triple",
    "integral we deform the path from @xmath533 to @xmath520 to an arc of circle centered at the origin which is path of steep descent for @xmath534 for the case @xmath159 ( as mentioned earlier in the treatment of .",
    "hence , it is exponentially small as @xmath98 .",
    "note that in the latter deformation we possibly pick up a residue again , which results in an additional double integral .",
    "however , since the contours are paths of steep descent / ascent the contribution of this term , possibly after an additional deformation , can be shown to be negligible .",
    "concluding , from the seven multiple integrals obtained after deforming the contours , the leading term in the asymptotic expansion for @xmath147 comes from the double integral .",
    "this integral equals the right - hand side of and we proved the statement .",
    "+ finally , we come to .",
    "if @xmath287 are sufficiently far apart , then this bound follows from .",
    "if on the other hand the points are close , then we need to deal with singularities in the integrals above .",
    "for example , the double integral that is over the contours in the left picture of figure  [ fig : finaldouble ] , is no longer exponentially small .",
    "in fact , both double integrals and grow logarithmically with @xmath87 as @xmath98 , in case the points @xmath366 come closer and closer .",
    "the fact of the matter is that in all integrals obtained after deformation , the logarithmic behavior is however the worst that can happen .",
    "this can be checked by introducing local variables in the triple and quadruple integrals .",
    "for example , in the quadruple integral the integrand has a singular term . as long as @xmath535 , then this is still integrable and the result is of order @xmath536 as @xmath537 .",
    "hence for @xmath159 we obtain .",
    "the other situations @xmath170 and @xmath498 can be dealt with in a similar way . however , care should be taken in case @xmath538 ( and hence @xmath539 ) .",
    "in that case , deforming the contours leads to divergent integrals .",
    "the way around this is to perturb one of the saddle points ( and the paths of steep descent / ascent ) with a term of @xmath529 and argue as above .",
