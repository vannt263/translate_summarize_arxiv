    "almost all the gravitational binding energy of the pre - supernova star is converted into neutrinos and antineutrinos in a core - collapse supernova , yielding a very large neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "consequently neutrino properties play a very important role , not only in the dynamics of a core - collapse supernova , but also in the r - process nucleosynthesis if supernovae are the appropriate sites @xcite .",
    "neutrinos traveling through supernovae undergo matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations ( due to the msw effect resulting from neutrinos interacting with the background electrons and positrons ) much like neutrinos traveling through the sun or the earth @xcite .",
    "however , unlike these latter sites , in a supernova environment it is possible to have matter - enhanced antineutrino flavor transformations @xcite .",
    "it was ascertained that , because of the large number of neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) emitted by the proto - neutron star , background neutrinos also contribute to the coherent forward scattering of neutrinos in a core - collapse supernova @xcite .",
    "once the importance of the flavor - mixing non - diagonal terms coming from neutrino - neutrino interactions was highlighted @xcite , it became clear that one deals with a genuine many - body problem with one- and two - body interactions .",
    "the significance of the neutrino - neutrino interactions in core - collapse supernovae @xcite and the possibility of the occurrence of collective effects due to those interactions were recognized early on @xcite . in a supernova environment neutrino - neutrino interactions",
    "@xcite play a crucial role both for neutrinos and antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "since such collective neutrino oscillations dominate the neutrino propagation much deeper than the conventional matter - induced msw effect , it would impact the r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive literature on this subject @xcite , a good starting point is several recent surveys @xcite .",
    "an algebraic approach to this problem was worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite from a many - body point of view .",
    "such an algebraic approach is helpful in exploring the hidden symmetries of the system .",
    "hamiltonian describing collective neutrino oscillations possesses an @xmath1 rotation symmetry in the neutrino flavor space @xcite .",
    "various collective modes , including spectral swappings or splittings arise from this symmetry even in the inhomogeneous or anisotropic environments @xcite .",
    "one expects that such a complex nonlinear system may exhibit further symmetries .",
    "indeed , several authors noted the presence of various conserved quantities in the collective neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that collective oscillations that maintain coherence can be classified by a number of linearly - independent functions @xcite , implying that scalar products of a unique linear combination of the original polarization vectors are conserved .",
    "the flavor evolution of a dense neutrino system by taking into account both the vacuum oscillations and self interactions of neutrinos from a many - body perspective was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the similarity between the collective neutrino oscillation hamiltonian and the bcs hamiltonian",
    "one can show that , in the single angle approximation , both the full many - body picture and the commonly - used effective one - particle picture possess several constants of motion @xcite .",
    "one appealing aspect of the core - collapse supernovae is that they are the laboratories where diverse aspects of neutrino physics come into play .",
    "here we concentrate on the collective behavior arising from the neutrino - neutrino interactions in a supernova and omit other interesting topics such as the role of sterile neutrinos @xcite or the neutrino magnetic moment @xcite in the r - process nucleosynthesis , effects of the cp - violation @xcite , effects of turbulence and density fluctuations @xcite , the role of neutrinos in shock revival @xcite , and neutrino signatures of black hole formation @xcite .",
    "the next chapter of this proceedings contribution describes the algebraic formulation of the neutrino - neutrino interactions in the many - neutrino system .",

    "this approximation is analogous to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , widely used in many - body physics . in the rpa",

    "these take the form @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .    recently",

    "its conservation needs to be enforced using a lagrange multiplier .",

    "@xcite it was shown that such an evolution leads to spectral splits .",
    "neutrino propagation through the dense media in the core - collapse supernovae probes many interesting collective effects .",
    "because of the neutrino - neutrino interactions , this many - body system is intrinsically non - linear , it can be linearized only in certain cases @xcite .",
    "we examined this many - neutrino system both from the exact many - body perspective and from the point of view of an effective one - body description formulated with the application of the rpa method . to achieve this goal we exploited mathematical similarities between the neutrino - neutrino interaction hamiltonian and the bcs pairing hamiltonian .",
    "( indeed , the n - mode collective oscillations of the neutrinos are related to the @xmath97-spin solutions of the bcs model @xcite ) . in the limit of the single angle approximation ,",
    "both the many - body and the rpa pictures possess many constants of motion manifesting the existence of associated dynamical symmetries in the system .",
    "judicious use of these invariants could certainly help numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "we treated the two - flavor neutrino - neutrino interaction in the single - angle approximation , and provided an interpretation of the critical energy in the spectral swap / split phenomenon as the lagrange multiplier of the number conservation constraint .",
    "recent numerical work with three flavors in the multi - angle approximation uncovers significant differences between single- and multi - angle formulations @xcite .",
    "in particular , multi - angle formulation is found to reduce the adiabaticity of flavor evolution in the normal neutrino mass hierarchy , resulting in lower swap energies .",
    "thus it seems that single - angle approximation seems to be sufficient in some cases , but inadequate in other situations .",
    "other questions remain regarding the many - body behavior of the neutrino system .",
    "for example , in the calculations so far neutrinos are assumed to be emitted half - isotropically ( only outward - moving modes are occupied with backward - moving modes being empty ) .",
    "however , recent realistic supernova simulations suggest that neutrino angular distributions are not half - isotropic @xcite .",
    "flavor - dependent angular distributions may lead to multi - angle instabilities @xcite .",
    "future work could uncover even more interesting features of this many - neutrino system .",
