    "a strongly correlated metallic system with a @xmath38 band structure is assumed for a @xmath14 dimensional simple - cubic lattice .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be the number of electrons ( or carriers ) and the number of atoms ( or lattices ) , respectively . in the case of one electron per atom , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ,",
    "the metallic system is a metal and the existence probability ( @xmath43= band filling ) of electrons on nearest - neighbor sites is one .",
    "the electrons have a spin on an atom .",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion is always given by @xmath44 , as shown in fig .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath45 which occurs by doping an element to a base insulator or metal , @xmath8 is determined by probability .",
    "the metallic system is quite complicated , as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( b ) . four types of regions for the system can be distinguished as possible extreme examples .",
    "region a in fig .",
    "1 ( b ) has no electrons on its atomic sites , which corresponds to a normal insulator .",
    "region c has a metallic structure of one electron per atom .",
    "regions b and d have a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) structure unlike the assumed cubic lattice .",
    "electrons in region d have opposite spins .",
    "this must be regarded as a cdw insulator with the cdw - energy gap depending on the local cdw - potential energy@xmath46 $ ] . moreover , even when one electron on an atom is removed , the nearest - neighbor sites of the atom without an electron and the atom itself are regarded as region b , as shown in fig .",
    "the potential energy can be interpreted as a potential for impurities in the metallic system .",
    "the cdw - potential energy , @xmath47 , is derived by breathing - mode distortion due to the charge disproportionation ( @xmath48 ) between nearest - neighbor sites , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are charges irrespective of spins on @xmath51 and @xmath52 sites , respectively .",
    "the cdw gap is regarded as a pseudogap ( or pinned cdw gap ) , and can be observed by optical methods@xmath35 $ ] , photoemission spectroscopy@xmath53 $ ] , and heat capacity measurement@xmath54 $ ] for high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "the pseudogap occurs if the number of carriers is less than the number of atoms .",
    "therefore , the metallic system is inhomogeneous and can not be self - consistently represented in @xmath55-space , @xmath41 , @xmath8 and the density of states of the system are not given . to overcome this difficulty , carriers on atoms in the metal phase ( region c ) have to be averaged over sites , as shown in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "the on - site effective charge is @xmath56 , on average over sites .",

    ", @xmath61 indicates that there are a few doubly occupied atoms , such as in region d. for the metallic side , @xmath67 indicates that a number of carriers exist .",
    "this suggests that region c is extremely wide .",
    "the insulating and metallic sides correspond to two phases , which are attributed to the metal - insulator instability ( or instability of the cdw - potential energy)@xmath68 $ ] at @xmath69=1 ( half filling ) .",
    "this indicates that a metal ( perfect single phase ) with the electronic structure of fig .",
    "1 ( a ) is not synthesized .",
    "junod et al.@xmath70 $ ] suggested that even the best samples are not 100@xmath71 superconducting , which supports the metal - insulator instability@xmath68 $ ] .",
    "thus , synthetic metals composed of several atoms always have the electronic structure of two phases , such as fig .",
    "1 ( b ) , which is a necessity of the development of @xmath72 .    to justify the fractional charge of carriers in the metallic system with two phases ,",
    "the concept of measurement is necessary . when measuring the charge of carriers in the metallic system of fig . 1 ( b ) ,",
    "the measured charge becomes the effective fractional one , @xmath72 , representing the average meaning of the system .",
    "this is because experimental data for the metallic system are expectation values of statistical averages .",
    "when @xmath73 measuring charge , the charge of carriers in region c in fig . 1 ( b ) remains the true elementary charge , not observed by means of measurement .",
    "accordingly , for the metallic system where @xmath74 , the effective fractional coulomb energy , @xmath59 , is defined by using @xmath72 and justified by means of measurement .    additionally ,",
    "although the justification is based on the metal insulator instability derived from the cdw theory , it can be applied to all strongly correlated metals including cuprate superconductors .",
    "this is because there is much experimental evidence for the cdw in cuprate superconductors although their parent materials are antiferromagnetic insulators , which is shown in a review paper@xmath75 $ ] .      for the metallic system regarded as a real synthetic metal with an electronic structure such as fig . 1 ( b ) , the effective mass of quasiparticles needs to be calculated .",
    "hamiltonians of the metallic system can be considered as follows .",
    "hamiltonian , @xmath76 , is given by    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the creation operators for electrons in the bloch state @xmath80 and the wannier state @xmath81 , respectively , and @xmath82 is the kinetic energy when @xmath8=0 .",

    "@xmath83 is supposed to describe the metallic system .",

    "two kinds of @xmath105 can be considered .",
    "one is eq .",
    "( 8) when the electronic structure is @xmath1170 , as shown in fig . 1 ( b )",

    "the other is eq .",
    "( 9 ) when the electronic structure is @xmath58=0 , as shown in fig . 1 ( c ) .",

    "( 8) with @xmath119 . here ,",
    "@xmath120 and @xmath121 , because the number of the effective charges , @xmath122 , is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that the metallic system with less than one electron per atom , as shown in fig . 1 ( c )",
    ", is mathematically consistent with that with one electron per atom , as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) .",
    "although the following calculations were performed by brinkman and rice , the calculations are applied to the effective mass . in the case of fig . 1 ( c ) , by applying eq .",
    "( 9 ) to eq .",
    "( 6 ) and by minimizing it with respect to @xmath123 , the number of the doubly occupied atoms is obtained as @xmath124 where @xmath125=8@xmath126 because of @xmath1270 , @xmath59 and @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 is the correlation strength . by applying eq .",
    "( 10 ) to eq .",
    "( 9 ) again , the effective mass is given by @xmath130    although the separate conditions are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 is defined under the combined condition @xmath134 and is an average of the true effective mass in the br picture for metal phase ( region c in fig . 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "( 11 ) is shown in fig .",
    "the effective mass increases as it approaches @xmath135=1 and @xmath136=1 . for @xmath1370 and @xmath1380 , the effective mass decreases and , finally , the metallic system undergoes a normal ( or band - type ) metal - insulator transition ; this transition is continus .",
    "the system at @xmath139 can be regarded as the insulating state which is the paramagnetic insulator because @xmath140 . at a @xmath141 value ( not one ) ,",
    "the mit from a metal at a @xmath69 value of just below @xmath69=1 to the insulator at both @xmath69=1 and @xmath141=1 is the first - order transition on band filling .",
    "this has been called the mott transition by many scientists including author . however , this is theoretically not the mott transition which is an first - order transition from a value of @xmath8 to @xmath125 in a metal with the electronic structure of one electron per atom at @xmath69=1 , as given in the br picture .",
    "the mott transition does not occur in real crystals because a perfect single - phase metal with @xmath69=1 is not made .",
    "conversely , by hole doping ( or electron doping to a metallic system with hole carriers ) of a very low concentration , the first - order transition from the insulator with @xmath113=0 to a metal can be interpreted as an abrupt breakdown of the balanced critical coulomb interaction , @xmath125 , between electrons .",
    "then , the @xmath125 value in the insulator reduces to a @xmath8 value in a metal phase and an insulating phase produces due to doping of opposite charges , as shown in fig .",
    "this first - order transition with band filling is very important result found in this picture , which differs from the continuous ( mott - hubbard or second - order ) transition by a large @xmath8 given by the hubbard theory .    in order to obtain the expectation value of the energy in the ( paramagnetic ) ground state , eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) are applied to eq .",
    "@xmath142 is given by @xmath143",
    "as @xmath144 approaches one , @xmath142 goes to zero .",
    "in addition , the spin susceptibility in the br picture is replaced by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath147 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the susceptibility is proportional to the effective mass which allows the enhancement of @xmath148 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath133 , @xmath149 and @xmath148 are the averages of true effective values in region c in fig . 1 ( b ) , which is described by the br picture , and are justified only by means of measurement . the true effective values in the br picture are not measured experimentally , as mentioned previously .",
    "in particular , the magnitude of the true effective mass in the br picture has the same value regardless of the extent of region c , while the measured effective mass depends upon the extent of region c. furthermore , validity of the br picture and the mott transition was also discussed by theorists@xmath150 $ ] , which is because the br picture has not been proved experimentally .",
    "however , the validity is indirectly proved through the above picture .",

    "the absolute value of @xmath154 increases linearly with @xmath23 up to at least @xmath23=0.95 .",
    "the band filling @xmath136 corresponds to @xmath23 because the number of doped carriers with @xmath23 agrees with the data for carriers obtained from the hall coefficient . the heat capacity in fig . 3 of reference 8 is replotted , as shown in fig . 2 ( b ) .",
    "the effective mass of eq . ( 11 ) closely follows the heat - capacity data where @xmath135=1 .",
    "the heat capacity increases with @xmath23 and peaks at @xmath23=0.95 .",
    "the first - order transition is found between @xmath23=0.95 and @xmath23=1 , which is not the mott transition defined by theory but the transition with band filling .",
    "tokura et al.@xmath24 $ ] and kumagai et al.@xmath152 $ ] suggested that the increase of the heat capacity with @xmath23 is due to an enhancement of the effective mass of correlated electrons , although the carrier density increases with @xmath23 ; the coefficient , @xmath155 , of the heat capacity is proportional to the effective mass in the fermi liquid theory .",
    "moreover , the large effective mass was also observed by optical methods@xmath156 $ ] and nuclear - magnetic - resonance experiments@xmath157 $ ] .    where @xmath1580.95 , @xmath141=1 in fig .",
    "2(b ) indicates that the true effective mass has a constant value even though the extent of region c in fig",
    ". 1 ( b ) changes .",
    "the increase of @xmath23 up to @xmath23=0.95 corresponds to the increase of region c. because region c is described by the br picture , the correlation strength of the br picture , @xmath159 , can be found .",
    "when it is assumed that the extent of the metal phase ( region c ) at @xmath23=0.95 is approximately the same as that at @xmath23=@xmath69=1 , a value of @xmath160 at @xmath136=0.95 and @xmath141=1 is approximately equal to that of @xmath161 in the br picture .",

    "thus , the data may be explained by the extended br picture .    in order to evaluate the correlation strength , @xmath159 , in the br picture according to the same calculation method as used for la@xmath20sr@xmath21tio@xmath22 in a previous section , when it is assumed that the extent of the metal phase ( corresponding to region c ) at @xmath69=0.96 and @xmath141=1 for ybco@xmath179 of @xmath1890.04 is the same as that at @xmath136=1 , @xmath160 at @xmath136=0.96 is approximately equal to @xmath161 in the br picture .",
    "then @xmath190=0.92 is obtained , which indicates that the ybco superconductor is strongly correlated .    in the case of la@xmath29sr@xmath21cuo@xmath30(lsco ) superconductors , the heat capacity data are applied to eq . ( 11 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "in addition , the effective mass , as measured by the de haas - van alphen effect at 2.3 k for yba@xmath31cu@xmath22o@xmath193 , was found to be @xmath194=2.8 - 4.4@xmath195 $ ] .",

    "these large masses might be attributed to the strong correlation in the br picture .",
    "it is suggested here that they may well be the cause of high-@xmath2 values for high-@xmath2 superconductors .    to account for high-@xmath2 superconductivity ,",
    "the van hove scenario or singularity ( vhs ) has been introduced .",
    "the extended saddle point near the fermi energy has also been observed by ultra - high - energy angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xmath197 $ ] .",
    "it has been suggested that a @xmath2 value is dependent on the extent ( or width and intensity of spectra ) of the flat band@xmath198 $ ] at the extended saddle - point energy@xmath199 $ ] .",
    "that is , the extent of the flat band , corresponding to the number of quasiparticles in the flat band , increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "however , if this interpretation is correct , it conflicts with the presence of quasiparticles at the fermi surface , as mentioned in the br and extended - br pictures and the heat capacity data mentioned previously .",
    "therefore , the singularity in the effective mass is different from the extended vhs , which may be a power law as a function of the difference between the extended saddle - point energy and the fermi energy .",

    "the main - band dispersion has been observed at the photon energy level of 33 @xmath204 for bi-2212 crystals . at @xmath203 ,",
    "the single - particle spectral weight , @xmath205 , is at a peak corresponding to quasiparticles .",
    "the peak can be regarded as band filling in the effective mass as 2d - dos .",
    "therefore , the extent of the flat band dependent on @xmath2 , as mentioned previously , can be interpreted as the magnitude of the weight at the fermi energy and as the extent of region c , too .",
    "furthermore , the new topology , such as the br picture with quasiparticles at the fermi surface , is within the fermi - liquid - theory framework .",
    "the first - order transition on band filling for sr@xmath20la@xmath21tio@xmath22 ( slto ) and the experimental data of the heat capacities , @xmath206=@xmath207 , for slto , ybco@xmath179 , and lsco were well correlated by the extended br picture .",
    "the true correlation strengths in the br picture in a metal phase ( region c ) were evaluated to be 0.90@xmath2081 for slto , 0.92@xmath2081 for ybco , and 0.92@xmath2081 for lsco .",
    "the true effective mass always has a constant value regardless of the magnitude of @xmath69 .",
