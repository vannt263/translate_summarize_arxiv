    "the lear antiproton storage ring was decommissioned in 1996 ; its successor facility , the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) , provides antiproton beams at momenta of 100 and 300mev/@xmath0 , at intensities up to @xmath1 per minute  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that germany has embarked on a @xmath2billion - euro upgrade plan for the gsi - darmstadt nuclear - physics laboratory that includes construction of 30 and 90gev rapid - cycling synchrotrons and low- and medium - energy antiproton storage rings  @xcite .",
    "these facilities address an interesting and varied research program in nuclear and particle physics and beyond .",
    ".antiproton energies and intensities at existing and future facilities .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath3 the lower number of operating hours at fair compared with that at other facilities arises from medium - energy antiproton operation having to share time with other programs .",
    "a number of intriguing recent discoveries can be elucidated at such a facility , foremost among which is charm mixing  @xcite . the key question is whether there is new physics in charm mixing ; the signature for this is _ cp _ violation  @xcite .",
    "the search for new physics in @xmath4 and @xmath5 mixing and decay has so far come up empty .",
    "thus it behooves us to look elsewhere as well .",
    "as pointed out by many authors , charm is an excellent venue for such investigation : it is the only up - type quark for which such effects are possible , and standard - model backgrounds to new physics in charm are suppressed by small ckm - matrix elements and the fact that the @xmath6 quark is the most massive one participating in loop diagrams  @xcite .",
    "we argue below that a charm experiment at the fermilab antiproton source might be the world s most sensitive",
    ".    other topics of interest include such states as the @xmath7 in the charmonium region  @xcite , observed by several groups , as well as the investigation of possible new - physics signals observed in the hypercp experiment at fermilab : evidence for _ cp _ violation  @xcite and flavor - changing neutral currents  @xcite in hyperon decay .",
    "in addition , the @xmath8 mass and width , @xmath9 radiative - decay angular distributions , and @xmath10 full and radiative widths , important parameters of the charmonium system that remain to be precisely determined  @xcite , are well suited to the @xmath11 technique  @xcite .",
    "charm particles can be pair - produced in @xmath12 or @xmath13 collisions at and above the @xmath14 resonance .",
    "there is an enormous cross - section advantage relative to @xmath15 colliders : charm hadroproduction cross sections are typically @xmath16b ) , while @xmath15 cross sections are @xmath17(1nb ) . against this",
    "must be weighed the @xmath15 luminosity advantage , typically @xmath18 , and the lower background rates in @xmath15 experiments .",
    "charm hadroproduction at high energies comes with the advantage of longer decay distances , but the countervailing disadvantage of higher multiplicity ( @xmath19 ) in the underlying event .",
    "we expect that the low charged - particle multiplicity ( @xmath20 ) in @xmath12 collisions somewhat above open - charm threshold will enable charm samples with cleanliness comparable to that at the @xmath4 factories , with the application of only modest cuts , and hence , high efficiency .",
    "the competition for this program is a possible  super-@xmath4 factory . \" by scanning the antiproton accumulator beam energy across the resonance , fermilab experiments e760 and e835 made the world s most precise measurements of charmonium masses and widths  @xcite . besides this precision",
    ", the other key advantage of the antiproton - annihilation technique is its ability to produce charmonium states of all quantum numbers , in contrast to @xmath15 machines which produce primarily @xmath21 states and the few states that couple directly to them , or ( with relatively low statistics ) states accessible in @xmath4 decay or in @xmath22 production .",
    "the e835 apparatus did not include a magnet , thus various cross sections needed to assess the performance and reach of a new experiment remain unmeasured .",
    "however , they can be estimated with some degree of confidence .",
    "we are proposing to assemble , quickly and at modest cost , an  upgraded e835 \" spectrometer that includes a magnet .",
    "if these cross sections are of the expected magnitude , it should be possible with this apparatus to make the world s best measurements of charm mixing and _ cp _ violation , as well as of the other effects mentioned above .",
    "( to take full advantage of the capabilities of the fermilab antiproton source , a follow - on experiment in a new , dedicated ring  la table  [ tab : sens - comp ] might then be designed for even greater sensitivity . )",
    "by adding a small magnet , tracking and vertex detectors , and tof counters to the e835 calorimeter as in fig .",
    "[ fig : e835-upgrade ] , plus modern , high - bandwidth triggering and data - acquisition systems , several important topics can be studied .",
    "we assume @xmath24@xmath25 or @xmath24@xmath26 luminosity of @xmath27@xmath28s@xmath29 , one order of magnitude beyond that of e835 , which can be accomplished by use of a denser internal target than the e835 hydrogen cluster jet  @xcite .",

    "the level of mixing is consistent with the wide range of standard - model predictions  @xcite ; however , this does not preclude a significant and potentially detectable contribution from new physics  @xcite .",
    "since some new - physics models predict different effects in the charge-2/3 (  up - type \" ) quark sector than in the down - type  @xcite , it is important to carry out such studies of charm mesons  the only up - type system for which meson mixing can occur .    the @xmath12 annihilation cross section to open charm could be substantial ; for example , a recent estimate gives @xmath32b at @xmath33gev  @xcite . at @xmath34@xmath28s@xmath29 ,",
    "this represents some @xmath35 events per year , substantially exceeding each year the integrated sample ( @xmath36 events ) available at the @xmath4 factories .",
    "since there will also be @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 events , the total charm sample will be even larger ; with the use of a target nucleus heavier than hydrogen , the charm - production @xmath40-dependence  @xcite could enhance statistics by an additional factor of a few . such a target could also localize primary interactions to an @xmath41m)-sized region , allowing the @xmath42-meson decay distance to be cleanly resolved .",
