    "the new measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provided by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite have both provided new and exquisitely precise observations of the cmb damping tail .",
    "this angular region of the cmb angular spectra , corresponding to the multipole range going from @xmath9 up to @xmath10 , plays a key role in the determination of crucial parameters like the relativistic number of degrees of freedom @xmath2 , the primordial helium abundance @xmath11 and the running @xmath12 of the scalar spectral index .    among those parameters , @xmath11 can be determined unambigously assuming standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( and thus does not represent a free parameter of the theory ) , while @xmath12 is expected to be negligible in most inflationary models . on the other hand , the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath2 practically parametrizes the energy density of relativistic particles in the early universe . in the standard scenario , with the three active relativistic neutrino species , a value of @xmath13",
    "is expected @xcite . deviations from this value due to a non - vanishing neutrino chemical potential are possible but bound to be small , especially in light of the recent evidences for a large value of the neutrino mixing angle @xmath14 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus a detection of @xmath15 would point to the presence of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics , like the existence of a yet unknown particle , e.g. , a sterile neutrino .",
    "the damping tail is not only affected by those parameters but also by other physical effects generally taking place at a much later epoch , well after recombination .",
    "these includes , for example , the extragalactic foreground emission of point sources , radio galaxies , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and similar unresolved backgrounds .",
    "these foregrounds can however be well identified by their spectral and angular dependence and have in general a minimal correlation with the cosmological parameters .",
    "more importantly , the cmb damping tail is affected by the lensing of cmb photons by dark matter clumps along the line of sight .",
    "this effect is linear , can be computed precisely and depends on the same cosmological parameters that affect the primary cmb spectrum .",
    "however , the lensing amplitude is strictly dependent from the growth of perturbations .",
    "this quantity can be significant different if , for example , general relativity is not the correct theory to describe gravity at the very large scales .",
    "if the accelerated expansion of our universe is indeed provided not by a dark energy component but by modified gravity , the perturbation growth could be dramatically different and change the expectations of lensing ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) . in order to test the correct amplitude of the lensing signal",
    ", one can introduce a calibration parameter @xmath16 , as in @xcite , that scales the lensing potential in such a way that @xmath17 corresponds to the complete absence of lensing , while @xmath18 is the expected lensed result assuming general relativity .",
    "a robust detection of @xmath16 being different from unity would hint to the fact that general relativity is not the correct theory to describe gravity at the cosmological scales .",
    "the new act and spt data , while broadly consistent with the expectations of the standard @xmath19cdm scenario , are indeed providing interesting hints for deviations from the simplest @xmath19cdm model when combined with the results from 7 years of observations from the wmap satellite ( wmap7 , @xcite ) .",
    "the spt experiment , for example , is confirming an indication for a value for @xmath20 .",
    "this indication , already present in the previous data release ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , is marginal when considering only the wmap7+spt data with @xmath21 at @xmath5 c.l .. however , it is more significant when the spt data is combined with the measurement of the hubble constant @xmath22 from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite and with information from baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data ( see table 4 in @xcite ) , yielding a final value of @xmath23 .    at the same time , the act collaboration presented a similar analysis obtaining different results . in particular , the wmap7+act data alone constrain the neutrino number to be @xmath24 , i.e. perfectly consistent with the standard three - neutrino framework .",
    "when the act data is combined with hst and bao data the value is higher , @xmath25 , but still consistent with three neutrinos families ( see table iii in @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , this is not the only tension between the two datasets .",
    "if we now consider the results on the lensing amplitude parameter , the spt dataset is fully compatible with the standard expectation , with @xmath26 at @xmath5 c.l .",
    "( see @xcite ) , while the act data suggest a 2@xmath27 deviation from the standard expectation , with @xmath28 at @xmath5 c.l ..    in this brief paper we further investigate these discrepancies by improving these analyses in two ways .",
    "first of all , we perform our analyses allowing _ both _ @xmath2 and @xmath16 parameters to vary at the same time . as we will see , this let to better identify the tension between the two experiments .",
    "secondly , we add the recent dataset from nine years of observations coming from the wmap satellite as in @xcite . both act and spt teams used the previous 7-year wmap dataset in their papers and some , albeit small",
    ", differences are present when the updated dataset is considered .",
    "our paper is simply organized as follows : in the next section we describe the analysis method , in section iii we present our results and in section iv we derive our conclusions .",
    "our analysis is based on a modified version of the public cosmomc @xcite monte carlo markov chain code .",
    "we consider the following cmb data : wmap9 @xcite , spt @xcite , act @xcite including measurements up to a maximum multipole number of @xmath29 .",
    "for all these experiments we make use of the publicly available codes and data . for the act experiment we use the `` lite '' version of the likelihood @xcite .",
    "since act and spt dataset are providing different results on the parameters , we will consider them separately .",
    "thus our basic cmb - only datasets consist of the wmap9+act and wmap9+spt data .",
    "we also consider the effect of including additional dataset to the basic datasets just described . consistently with the measurements of the hst @xcite , we consider a gaussian prior on the hubble constant @xmath30 .",
    "we also include information from measurements of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from galaxy surveys . here",
    "we follow the approach presented in @xcite combining four datasets : 6dfgrs from @xcite , sdss - dr7 from @xcite , sdss - dr9 from @xcite and wigglez from @xcite .",
    "we sample the standard six - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath33 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath34 , the scalar spectral index @xmath35 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "since the act and spt data are showing indications for deviations from their standard values , we also consider variations in the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath2 and in the lensing amplitude parameter @xmath16 as defined in @xcite , that simply rescales the lensing potential : @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the power spectrum of the lensing field .",
    "we take flat priors on all the parameters ; in particular , we take @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in our basic runs",
    ", we do not consider the effect of massive neutrinos .",
    "we perform additional runs in which we allow for a non - vanishing neutrino mass , parametrized by means of the neutrino fraction @xmath42",
    ". we always assume standard big bang nucleosynthesis , so that the helium abundance @xmath11 is uniquely determined by the values of @xmath43 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in order to assess the convergence of our mcmc chains , we compute the gelman and rubin @xmath44 parameter demanding that @xmath45 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]             vs @xmath46 plane for the spt+wmap+bao+hst and act+wmap+bao+hst datasets .",
    "a degeneracy is present between the two parameters : larger values for @xmath16 let larger neutrino masses to be more consistent with the data . the spt indication for a neutrino mass is driven by the low value of @xmath16 obtained in the neutrino massless case .",
    "]    as stated in the previous section , we consider the act and spt datasets separately .",
    "we therefore perform the following four analyses : wmap9@xmath47act , wmap9@xmath47act@xmath47hst@xmath47bao , wmap9@xmath47spt , and wmap9@xmath47spt@xmath47hst@xmath47bao .    in table",
    "i we report the constraints on the considered parameters from each run .",
    "as we can see , the act and spt are providing significantly different constraints on the @xmath2 and @xmath16 parameters .    in order to further investigate this discrepancy , we plot in figure [ alneff ] the 2-d constraints on the @xmath2 vs @xmath16 plane for the cmb only case and for the cmb+hst+bao analysis .    as we can see , a tension is clearly present since the central values for @xmath2 and @xmath16 obtained from wmap9+act analysis are outside the @xmath8 confidence level of the wmap9+spt and vice - versa .",
    "namely , the act dataset is pointing towards a value of @xmath2 fully consistent with the standard scenario of @xmath13 , while ( as it can be seen from table 1 and figure 1 ) , preferring at the same time an exotic high value for the lensing potential , with @xmath16 larger than unity at more than @xmath48 c.l . when the bao and hst datasets are included . considering the @xmath8 confidence levels we found @xmath49 for the wmap+act analysis and @xmath50 for the wmap+act+bao+hst .",
    "the situation is opposite for the spt data : while spt is fully consistent with @xmath18 , @xmath2 is constrained to a larger value than the standard expectation . when also the hst and bao data are included , we see that not only a value of @xmath51 is suggested at more than @xmath8 c.l . , but also a value of @xmath16 smaller than one is suggested at about @xmath5 c.l ..    in particular , we found that @xmath52 at @xmath8 c.l . from wmap9+spt+bao+hst while @xmath53 at @xmath8 c.l . from wmap9+act+bao+hst ,",
    "i.e. for the lensing parameter the spt and act datasets are providing constraints that are in disagreement at more than @xmath8 c.l ..    it is interesting to note that the tension between the act and spt datasets is clearly not limited to @xmath16 or @xmath2 : also the constraints on @xmath54 , @xmath35 , @xmath43 and @xmath55 appear as quite different .",
    "the discrepancy is however less significant since the central values are inside the @xmath8 confidence level of each analysis ( see figure [ altri ] ) .",
    "the results discussed so far are relative to the analysis in which all neutrinos are considered as relativistic and massless . since the spt dataset is claiming a detection at @xmath8 c.l . for a neutrino mass with @xmath56 in a wmap7+spt+bao+hst analysis ( see @xcite ) , it is clearly interesting to consider also massive neutrinos .    in table ii we present the constraint on cosmological parameters from the wmap9+spt+hst+bao and wmap9+act+hst+bao datasets respectively when variation in the neutrino masses are included in two cases : varying @xmath16 and fixing @xmath18 .    as we can see , while the act dataset does not favour the presence of neutrino masses , the spt dataset gives @xmath57 at @xmath5 c.l .",
    "in the case of @xmath18 and a lower limit limit @xmath58 at @xmath8 c.l .. this is consistent with the results reported in @xcite considering the different wmap and bao datasets . however ,",
    "when @xmath16 is let to vary , the evidence for a neutrino mass vanishes , as also clearly see in figure [ posteriormnu ] .",
    "we can better see what is happening by looking at the constraints in the @xmath16 vs @xmath46 plane in figure 4 .",
    "as we can see , there is a degeneracy between @xmath16 and @xmath46 .",
    "namely , a larger value of @xmath46 decreases the lensing signal and can be compensated with a larger @xmath16 . since the spt dataset is preferring smaller values of the lensing parameter , an analysis with @xmath18 forces the neutrino mass to be more consistent with the data .",
    "is also worth mentioning that including a neutrino mass exacerbates the lensing problem for act .",
    "the lensing parameter @xmath16 is even higher when massive neutrinos are considered ( see table ii ) .",
    "in this paper we have pointed out a tension between the parameter values estimated from the recent act and spt datasets .",
    "this discrepancy , albeit not significantly more than the @xmath8 confidence level , is indicating the possible presence of systematics in at least one of the two datasets .",
    "the spt experiment is confirming the previous indications for a `` dark radiation '' component with @xmath6 at @xmath5 c.l . ; in particular we have found that @xmath59 at more than @xmath48 c.l .. this result is clearly interesting since , if confirmed with larger significance by future data , could be possibly explained by several physical mechanisms , and would hint to new physics . in fact , the most conventional explanation for @xmath20 would be the presence of non - vanishing neutrino chemical potentials , i.e. of a cosmological lepton asymmetry .",
    "however , as it was shown in refs.@xcite through the analysis of bbn and cmb data , lepton asymmetries can at most account for @xmath60 , given the recent measurements of the neutrino mixing angle @xmath14 by the daya bay @xcite and reno experiments @xcite that exclude a zero value for @xmath14 with high significance .",
    "thus , if confirmed , a value of @xmath2 larger than 3.1 definitely requires some non - conventional explanation .",
    "sterile neutrinos , extra dimensions , gravity waves or non - standard neutrino decoupling could all be viable new mechanisms to explain a value of @xmath2 larger than the standard value ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the act experiment is , on the contrary , fully consistent with @xmath61 even when the hst and bao dataset are included .",
    "there is clearly no evidence for dark radiation from act ; moreover the case for a fourth , massless neutrino , such that @xmath62 is excluded at more than @xmath8 c.l . when only cmb data is considered . in particular",
    ", we found at @xmath8 c.l . that @xmath63 for wmap9+act and @xmath64 for wmap9+act+bao+hst .",
    "it is interesting to notice that our wmap9+act+bao+hst run provides the constraint @xmath3 while a similar analysis from act gives @xmath25 but with @xmath18 and with the wmap7 data .",
    "however , act presents a value for the lensing parameter that is off by more than @xmath8 from the expected value @xmath18 .",
    "this result is probably more difficult to explain from a physical point of view than a deviation in @xmath2 and calls for more drastic changes in the cosmological model . a possible way to enhance",
    "the lensing signal is to assume a modification to general relativity .",
    "@xmath65 models as those investigated in @xcite could in principle enhance the lensing signal , even if it is not clear if they could enhance it by @xmath66 and be at the same time consistent with other independent limits coming from tests of general relativity , like , e.g. solar system tests .",
    "other possible explanations include coupled dark energy models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "clearly , it may be that the act lensing signal is on the contrary simply produced by some unknown systematic as also suggested by the inclusion of the act deflection spectrum data , that shifts the value to @xmath67 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however it is not clear if this systematic could also affect the act constrain on @xmath2 and other parameters .",
    "the spt experiment is compatible with @xmath18 but is suggesting a value @xmath68 at about @xmath5 c.l .",
    "especially when also the bao and hst data are included .",
    "the act and spt measurements of @xmath16 , even if we consider variation in the @xmath2 parameter , are in disagreement at more than @xmath8 c.l ..    finally , we have also considered variation in the neutrino mass and show that the current indication for a neutrino mass from the spt+wmap9+bao+hst run is driven by the lower lensing amplitude measured by spt . if we let the lensing parameter @xmath16 to vary the indication for a neutrino mass vanishes .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the inclusion of a neutrino mass exacerbates the lensing problem for the act data with the @xmath16 even more discrepant with the @xmath18 case .",
    "the constraints on the neutrino mass from act are weaker when variations in @xmath16 are considered .    in this paper",
    "we have only considered a limited set of parameters but the tension between spt and act is present also in other , relevant , parameters .",
    "the spt dataset , for example , shows a preference for a negative running of the inflationary spectral index at more than @xmath8 c.l . while the act data is consistent with a zero running in between the @xmath8 c.l .",
    "( see figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the whole picture is , at the moment , stimulating and puzzling at the same time .",
    "the act and spt collaborations have provided an impressive confirmation of the theoretical expectations concerning the damping tail of the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "however they are also suggesting interesting deviations from the standard picture , that are unfortunately very different and opposite",
    ". it will be the duty of future re - analyses of the act and spt data ( possibly stemming from within the collaborations themselves ) and experiments ( e.g. , planck ) to finally decide whether what act and spt are currently seeing is due to dark radiation , dark gravity or more simply to an unidentified ( hence , dark too ) experimental systematic effect .",
