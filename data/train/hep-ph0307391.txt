    "the discovery of a higgs boson is one of the major goals of present and future searches in particle physics .",
    "global electroweak fits within the standard model ( sm ) yield an upper bound on the higgs - boson mass of @xmath7 gev at @xmath8 confidence level ( cl )  @xcite . together with the direct - search limit from the lep experiments  @xcite of @xmath9  gev , the higgs boson seems  just around the corner \" .    the still hypothetical higgs sector of the sm can be enlarged and some simple extensions such as the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) versions  @xcite are intensively studied .",
    "such extensions add new phenomena , like the charged higgs - boson sector , and satisfies the relevant constraint @xmath10 up to finite radiative corrections .",
    "actually , there are two versions of the thdm , type i and type ii , differing in some higgs couplings to fermions , but in both types and after electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs spectrum is the same : two charged higgs particles @xmath11 , two cp - even @xmath12 , @xmath13 and one cp  odd @xmath14 . aside the charged higgs sector , the neutral sector of the thdm is noticeably different from the sm single - higgs sector . whereas the discovery of a charged scalar higgs boson would attest definitively that the standard model is overcome , more refined investigations would be necessary in case of a neutral higgs particle , in the sm and beyond  @xcite .    in order to establish the higgs mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking , we need to measure the higgs couplings to fermions and to gauge bosons as well as the self - interaction of higgs bosons .",
    "such measurements , if precise enough , can be helpful in discriminating between the models through their sensitivity to quantum - correction effects , in particular in specific cases like the decoupling limit . for a linear collider , it has been shown  @xcite that the higgs - boson couplings to third - generation fermions and gauge bosons can be measured with high precision of the order 13% .    the _ decoupling theorem _",
    "@xcite states , in brief , that , if we have a theory with light and heavy particles , under certain conditions , the effects of heavy particles only appear in the low - energy theory through renormalization of couplings and masses of the effective theory or through corrections proportional to a negative power of the heavy masses . the _",
    "decoupling theorem _ is not universal and suffers from some known exceptions  @xcite . to be sure that the theorem holds , the low - energy theory has to be renormalizable , and it should have neither spontaneous symmetry breaking nor chiral fermions , which does not apply to the mssm and the thdm .",
    "a formal and general proof of decoupling of the non - standard mssm particles from the low - energy electroweak gauge - boson physics has been given in  @xcite .",
    "conversely , concerning higgs physics , it is known that the susy one - loop corrections do not decouple , in general , in the limit of a heavy supersymmetric spectrum  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is not yet rigorously proven that this decoupling theorem applies in the case of the thdm @xcite .",
    "but one can be less ambitious and consider a weaker version for the _ decoupling limit _",
    "@xcite , where all the scalar masses with one exception formally become infinite . for the case of the thdm ,",
    "this limit designs the cp - even @xmath13 as the light scalar particle while the other higgs particles , the cp - even @xmath12 , the cp - odd @xmath14 , and the charged higgs boson @xmath15 are extremely heavy and mass - degenerate . in using pure algebraic arguments at the tree level , and more sophisticated ones at the loop level",
    ", one can derive the main consequences : in the _ decoupling limit _",
    ", @xmath16 , the cp - even @xmath13 of the thdm and the sm higgs @xmath17 have quite similar tree level couplings to gauge bosons and fermions as well @xcite . here",
    "@xmath18 is the mixing angle in the cp - even sector and @xmath19 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values@xcite .",
    "since the scalar sector of the mssm is a particular case of thdm , the various decoupling scenarios also take place in the mssm and give similar consequences as in the thdm .",
    "obviously , the _ decoupling limit _ does not rigorously apply to a more realistic world where the particles masses are in a finite range .",
    "actually , one may consider a less rigorous scenario , labeled as the _ decoupling regime _",
    "@xcite , where we only require that the heavy higgs particles have masses much larger than the @xmath20 boson mass .",
    "however , such a scenario with large masses has to agree with the unitarity of the @xmath21-matrix .",
    "the unitarity constraint puts in turn bounds on the amplitude of partial waves  @xcite , which give finally constraints on the values of the coupling constants .",
    "the problem in models with symmetry breaking is that couplings and masses are not independent ; hence , unitarity of the @xmath21-matrix implies upper bounds on masses in the sm as well as in the thdm .",
    "since perturbative expansion is used , it is impossible to find the exact bounds ; instead , one can derive tree - level unitarity bounds or loop - improved unitarity bounds . in this study",
    ", we will use unitarity bounds coming from a tree - level analysis  @xcite .",
    "this tree level analysis is derived with the help of the equivalence theorem @xcite , which itself is a high - energy approximation where it is assumed that the energy scale is much larger than the @xmath22 and @xmath23 gauge - boson masses .",
    "we will consider here this `` high - energy '' hypothesis that both the equivalence theorem and the decoupling regime are well settled , but in such a way that the unitarity constraint is also fulfilled .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the quantum effects in the decays of the light cp - even higgs boson @xmath13 , especially looking for sizeable differences with respect to the sm in the decoupling regime .",
    "several studies have been carried out looking for non - decoupling effects in higgs - boson decays and higgs self - interactions .",
    "large loop effects in @xmath24 and @xmath2 have been pointed out for both the mssm  @xcite and the thdm  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop susy - qcd effects in @xmath0 were addressed in  @xcite and their decoupling properties are well discussed and understood .",
    "the loop contribution to the triple @xmath13 self - coupling has been investigated in the mssm  @xcite as well as in the thdm @xcite , revealing non - decoupling effects which , however , in the mssm case disappear when the self - coupling is expressed in terms of the @xmath13 mass  @xcite .",
    "the present study assumes the following chronology and scenario : the sm model is not ruled out by any experiment , no susy evidence , no charged higgs and no cp - odd higgs signal , a light cp - even higgs is detected and its properties are rather close to the sm higgs .",
    "a very natural question emerges : what kind of higgs we got ?",
    "it seems difficult to disentangle the higgs particle of the basic sm from other higgs bosons involved in extended models like the thdm or mssm .",
    "we will focus on the perhaps most difficult scenario , where all the higgs particles of the thdm , except the lightest cp - even higgs , are heavy to escape detection at the first stage of next generation colliders .",
    "in this paper we investigate three decay modes of the cp - even neutral higgs boson @xmath13 ( thdm ) or @xmath17 ( sm ) : the decay into a pair of photons , the decay into a photon in association with a @xmath20 boson , and the decay into a @xmath25 quark pair .",
    "the decays into the gauge - boson pairs are loop - mediated processes since the photon does not couple to neutral particles .",
    "in contrast , the decay into a fermion pair already exists at the tree level because of the higgs@xmath26 yukawa interaction . for the specific scenario where only a single light higgs particle exists with tree - level coupling constants as in the sm , the coupling structure of the virtual non - standard heavy particles in the quantum contributions to the bosonic decay rates yield sizeable differences to the sm decay rates .",
    "simultaneously , these quantum corrections also influence the fermionic decay rates and thus make them differ significantly from the sm result as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we address the higgs - boson decay channels under study and outline the calculation of the one - loop contribution to the @xmath0 partial width , giving details about the renormalization scheme used .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the presentation and discussion of our numerical results .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the one - loop contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which have been known already for a while  @xcite . then , we present in more details the one - loop contribution to @xmath0 as well as details of the renormalization scheme used .    we first start with the decay channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are loop - induced , the only pure thdm contribution comes from charged higgs loops , which may lead to non - decoupling effects . in the decoupling regime , with @xmath28 , the charged higgs contribution enters at the one - loop level through the following coupling , g[h^0h^+h^- ] & = & -\\ { m_h^0 ^ 2 + 2(m_h^^2 -_5 v^2 ) } [ h0hphm ] where @xmath29 .",
    "to derive this coupling we have used the cp conserving scalar potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the parameter @xmath30 breaks softly the discrete symmetry @xmath31 .",
    "the decay rates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are taken from ref .  @xcite . from the form of the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ h0hphm ] ) , one can see that the quadratic term @xmath32 can be compensated by @xmath33 . with charged higgs - boson masses much larger than the electroweak scale ( @xmath34 ) , such cancellations",
    "take place only for large values of @xmath30 @xcite . for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the charged higgs contribution , entering through eq .",
    "( [ h0hphm ] ) , vanishes for the critical choice of @xmath37 , where _ 5 ^ 0 = \\ { m_h^0 ^ 2 + 2 m_h^^2 } [ zero ] .    for the higgs decay @xmath0 , we evaluate the partial width @xmath38 at the one - loop level , in both the sm and the thdm , using the sm width as a reference .",
    "the model - independent contributions , qcd and qed corrections , are not included . for @xmath39 in the sm , we have performed the calculation in the on - shell scheme  @xcite , in analogy to the work presented in  @xcite .",
    "practical computations were done with the help of the packages _ feynarts , formcalc _  @xcite , and with looptools and ff for numerical evaluations  @xcite .",
    "the thdm is nowadays available in the package _",
    "feynarts_.    at one - loop order the amplitude can be written as follows , [ amplitude ] m_1 = - with @xmath40 , and [ oneloopterms ] _ 1 & = & v_1^h^0 b|b + ( h^0 b|b ) , _ 12 = - , + z_h^0 & = & ^-1 .",
    "these expressions contain the vertex corrections @xmath41 with the corresponding vertex counterterm @xmath42 , the non - diagonal @xmath13@xmath12 self - energy @xmath43 with the counterterm @xmath44 for the mixing angle @xmath18 , and the wave - function renormalization with the @xmath13 field - renormalization constant @xmath45 derived from the renormalized self - energy of the @xmath13 .    in the general thdm , the mixing angle",
    "@xmath18 is an independent parameter and can hence be renormalized in a way independent of all the other renormalization conditions .",
    "a simple and natural condition is to require that @xmath44 absorbs the @xmath13@xmath12 transition in the non - diagonal part @xmath46 of the decay amplitude  ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "the angle @xmath18 is hence the cp - even higgs - boson mixing angle also at the one - loop level , and the decay amplitude @xmath47 simplifies to the @xmath48 term only .",
    "the higgs - boson decay width is then given by the expression _",
    "1(h^0 b|b ) = m_h^0 z_h^0 [ 1 + 2 ( _ 1 ) ] .",
    "[ width ]    the central part of the computation is thus the determination of @xmath49 .",
    "the generic thdm contributions to @xmath49 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , involving vertex - correction and counterterm diagrams .",
    "a quick inspection shows that there are pure thdm contributions not present in the sm case : diagram @xmath50 with @xmath51 , diagram @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and lastly diagrams @xmath57 with @xmath58 . in the decoupling limit ,",

    ", large effects in @xmath0 may arise from diagrams @xmath50 and @xmath60 .",
    "thereby , @xmath52 formally has non - decoupling behaviour , yielding a non - zero value in the mathematical limit of heavy non - standard particles .",
    "we refrain here from giving analytical expressions for the vertex corrections ; the mssm formulae given in @xcite can be adapted to the thdm case replacing the mssm couplings by the thdm ones  @xcite .    .",
