    "low gain fels with wavelength down to @xmath2 ( 6ev ) have been in operation at storage rings using optical cavities(refs ) .",
    "short wavelength fels presently use linacs as drivers since they provide necessary electron beam quality .",
    "x - ray fels such as lcls , european xfel or swiss fel are now in operation or under construction worldwide .",
    "they use linacs as drivers to assure beam qualities necessary for a sase process at those wavelengthes . for a typical wavelength ( 1kev-30kev )",
    "the european xfel requires emittances below @xmath3 , energy spreads @xmath4 and peak currents ov several @xmath5 at electron beam energies up to @xmath6 .",
    "the saturation length ( for basic definitions in the fel theory see e.g. @xcite ) roughly defines the minimum practically sensible undulator length . at european xfel ,",
    "for the shortest wavelength , achieved with the maximum electron beam energy , the saturation length can be a hundred meters , but for soft x - rays it can be as short as 30 meters depending on the wavelength and electron beam parameters .",
    "this makes it in principle possible to fit such an undulator into a storage ring .",
    "beam parameters in latest generation light sources such as petraiii ( see tab . [",
    "tab : p3 ] ) are such that for uv photons the beam quality is not far removed from that required for an fel . for shorter wavelength saturation length becomes larger and the possibility of using the stored beam for sase fel directly becomes limited .",
    "the interest in shorter wavelength storage - ring based fels has recently been growing since they could combine extreme peak brightness and coherence of an fel with continuous operation and lower power consumption of a storage ring ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) an insertion device with longitudinal focusing ( of crab cavity type , discussed e.g. in @xcite ) would consist of a compression section , sase undulator , and a decompression section .",
    "the rest of the ring could be passed with the usual bunch length .",
    "a design sketch is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "it could be used as an insertion or as a bypass subject to space availability . in the following some simulation studies for the possibility of integrating such an insertion into petraiii",
    "are presented .",
    "all calculations are performed with xcode @xcite .",

    "if using the fodo optics , decreasing the beam size is possible down to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the period length . e.g. 4 m fodo optics will require short undulators of @xmath12 length with quadrupoles between them .",

    "synchrotron radiation induces bunch diffusion , mostly in the longitudinal phase space .",
    "such diffusion is in principle a limiting factor even for linac - based fel performance , however for the device in question the diffusion footprint is similar to that of standard ring insertion devices and is not in principle a limiting factor .",
    "moreover , the fel undulators can potentially be used in place of damping wigglers for reducing the emittance .",
    "a major limiting factor in fels is the coherent synchrotron radiation @xcite . in",
    "the design discussed the bunch length (  1ps ) is 5 - 6 orders of magnitude longer than the critical wavelength of the bending magnet radiation (  2 - 20kev for 0.1 - 1 t dipoles ) , whereas csr manifests itself when the bunch length is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation emitted .",
    "estimates based on taking into account the power enhancement factor    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the number of particles in the bunch , @xmath16 the bunch form factor and @xmath17 the radiation wavelength , show negligible effect on the total emitted power of sycnchrotron radiation .",
    "another sase undulator effect on the beam is microbunching which is washed away in dispersive sections and should not present a problem .",

    "a.   although csr should not be a limiting factor , possibilities for other instabilities need investigation .",
    "b.   another possible effect is the longitudinal phase space dilution due to nonlinearity of space rotation during compression and decompression in combinanion with diffusion or mismatching of rf phases , voltages , or @xmath19 .",
    "a calculation for 1000 iterations assuming 1% random perurbation to the one - pass map ( figure [ fig : noise ] ) suggests that the effect should notation play a role if the compressor and decompressor pair is tuned properly .",
    "c.   electron optics design has to be performed to match the existing beam transport . in this work power estimates",
    "were done based on standard fodo optics with @xmath20 . due to large difference in the vertical and horizontal emittances , special optics producing round beams",
    "will improve the performance .",
    "this could be achieved by emittance exchange bewteen the vertical and the horizontal ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sat4 ] ) plane or possibly by an assymetric low-@xmath21 optics .",
    "the energy spread after the first focusing rf cavity is significant ( 5% ) .",
    "this will require very large momentum acceptance optics in the insertion .",
    "all these questions require separate r&d .    with proper optimization of the layout for the x - ray wavelength of interest to experiments , and assuming short bunch operation ( @xmath04ps ) of a storage ring , operation of @xmath0100 m long insertion device with longitudinal focusing as an fel in the present or next @xcite generation of light sources producing ps photon pulses of high peak power seems theoretically possible .",
