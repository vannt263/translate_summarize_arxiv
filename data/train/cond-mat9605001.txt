    "heavy fermion and valence fluctuation phenomena ( see e.g. , @xcite ) observed in ce and yb compounds have been often described by the impurity anderson model  @xcite .",
    "due to a large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 between @xmath5-electrons , these compounds are considered as typical examples of strongly correlated systems to which the conventional canonical perturbation technique can not be applied . a systematic large-@xmath1 ( @xmath1 the spin and orbital degeneracy ) expansion method has been used for the assumed infinite-@xmath0 model to describe dynamical as well as thermodynamic properties@xcite .",
    "the infinite-@xmath0 treatment allows one to consider only @xmath2 and @xmath3 subspaces of @xmath5-electrons , and thus makes the problem quite simple .",
    "however , this scheme can not be justified for realistic systems because @xmath0 is not an infinity ( 5@xmath6ev typically ) . especially in ce compounds , @xmath4 configurations are even energetically comparable to the @xmath2 configuration .    in the  spin fluctuation \" limit ( or kondo limit ) , the finite-@xmath0 effect is manifested in various physical properties through the renormalized kondo temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath7 arises from the change of the exchange coupling constant @xmath8 between conduction electron and @xmath5-electron spins due to a finite @xmath0 , in a sense of the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite .",
    "while this effect was recognized in the exact bethe ansatz approach  @xcite and also in the numerical renormalization group approach  @xcite for @xmath9 , more appropriate descriptions of the systems with @xmath10 were provided by the large-@xmath1 treatments including the @xmath4- subspace in the variational approach  @xcite and in the perturbational approach  @xcite . using the generalized slave boson technique , schiller and zevin  @xcite",
    "have shown that the lowest order perturbation expansion reproduces the exact @xmath11 variational result at zero temperature ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated effects of an external magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) in the finite-@xmath0 impurity anderson model , employing the slave boson technique  @xcite which is generalized to the finite-@xmath0 case @xcite . to our knowledge , there has been no previous study of considering both the finite-@xmath0 and the magnetic field effect , simultaneously .",
    "we obtain the kondo temperature and the impurity magnetization as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "the impurity magnetization at a finite temperature is also determined . in the finite-@xmath0 case",
    ", a set of coupled integral equations appears even in the lowest order @xmath14 expansion . in order to solve the coupled integral equations , we have exploited simplifying approximations which reduce substantial computational efforts .",
    "this treatment allows one to study easily even anisotropic systems , such as those with an external magnetic field or with crystalline fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the large-@xmath1 slave boson theory is formulated for the finite-@xmath0 impurity anderson model . in section iii",
    ", approximation schemes used in evaluating the integral equations are described , and the @xmath0-dependence of the kondo temperature is provided .",
    "section iv is devoted to studying the model in the presence of the external magnetic field both at @xmath12 and at a finite temperature .",
    "a special attention is paid to the field dependence of the magnetization .",
    "finally , conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "we consider the finite-@xmath0 impurity anderson hamiltonian in a partial wave representation : @xmath16 where the indices @xmath17 denote spin and orbital quantum numbers . the operator @xmath18 creates ( annihilates ) a conduction electron in the state @xmath19 with an energy dispersion of @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath5-electrons of the magnetic impurity have @xmath22-dependent energy @xmath23 . the corresponding creation ( annihilation ) operator and the number operator are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the matrix element @xmath26 represents the hoping of an electron between the conduction band and the impurity level .",
    "we assume that the hoping takes place only between the states with the same @xmath22 , and that the @xmath26 is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq.([eq : hamil ] ) is studied in the subspace of at most double occupancy , that is , in the subspace of @xmath27 , and @xmath4 states .",
    "this is a good starting point , since @xmath0 is large enough to rule out configurations with more than double occupancies .",
    "coleman  @xcite has introduced a single slave boson @xmath28 to treat the infinite-@xmath0 model .",
    "then standard many - body techniques can be utilized in this approach without losing the strongly correlated properties of the model .",
    "coleman s method can be generalized to study the finite-@xmath0 model , by introducing a set of ` heavy bosons ' @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the heavy bosons represent @xmath30 doubly occupied @xmath4 states , energies of which are @xmath31 . in this scheme ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath32 this hamiltonian commutes with the  charge \" operator @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 physical quantities of the impurity anderson model should be obtained with the constraint @xmath35 .",
    "one way to impose the constraint is to add a ` chemical potential ' term @xmath36 to @xmath37 , and to project it onto the physical subspace @xmath35 by taking @xmath38 at the end of calculation  @xcite .    with this prescription ,",
    "the partition function and other quantities are expressed in terms of the spectral functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 corresponding to the @xmath41 states , respectively . the total partition function can be decoupled to a product @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the partition function of the non - interacting conduction electrons and @xmath44 is the impurity contribution given by @xmath45 each of the spectral function is related to the imaginary part of the corresponding retarded green s function @xmath46 : @xmath47 the green s functions are written in terms of their self - energies @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 :    [ eq : green ] @xmath51    with a positive infinitesimal number @xmath52 .",
    "the self - energies can be evaluated by using the  non - crossing approximation ( nca ) \" which is generalized for the finite-@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "recall that the nca has been very successful for the infinite-@xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "the  generalized nca \" scheme leads to coupled integral equations containing complicated vertex corrections .",
    "for this reason , it is practically impossible to solve the equations exactly , and so some simplifying approximations are necessary to resolve the problem .    instead of using the generalized nca ,",
    "we adopt here a simple picture of considering only the lowest order diagrams in @xmath14 , that is @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , crucial finite-@xmath0 effects are incorporated already in the lowest order diagrams , as shown below .",
    "figure [ fig : diagrams ] shows the lowest order diagrams for the self - energies of the empty boson and the pseudo - fermion @xmath5 .",
    "the self - energy of the heavy @xmath54-boson has no contribution in the lowest order .",
    "diagrams in fig.[fig : diagrams ] are calculated by using the standard feynman rules with the projection procedure mentioned above :    @xmath55    with the vertex function , @xmath56 and @xmath57    here @xmath58 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , and @xmath59 is the hopping rate of an electron between conduction band and impurity state in a magnetic channel . here @xmath60 is the density of states of the conduction band .",
    "the hopping rate is assumed to be a constant @xmath61 for @xmath62 and 0 otherwise .",
    "eqs.([eq : pi ] ) - ( [ eq : self_d ] ) with eq.([eq : green ] ) complete the theory of the lowest order in @xmath14 .",
    "the present treatment reproduces at @xmath12 the exact @xmath11 results of the variational approach  @xcite .    in the spin fluctuation limit , where @xmath2 and @xmath4 configurations are energetically unfavorable relative to @xmath3 , most important properties of the anderson model are determined by the @xmath28-boson self - energy @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath48 contains diagrams representing successive  spin - flip \" scatterings , which consist of two kinds of processes as shown in fig.[fig : spinflip ] .",
    "these are the processes which give rise to the coupling constant @xmath63 between conduction electron spin and the impurity spin , in the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite . while the process ( a ) in the figure is present in the infinite-@xmath0 model having an @xmath2 intermediate state , the process ( b ) which contains the @xmath54-boson line as an intermediate state does not exist in the infinite-@xmath0 model .",
    "the process ( b ) , which comes out from the vertex function @xmath64 in the empty boson self - energy , leads to a renormalization of the kondo temperature @xmath7 through the modification of the coupling constant @xmath65 and @xmath66 } $ ] .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the finite-@xmath0 impurity anderson model in the restricted subspaces @xmath67 , and @xmath4 are determined entirely by the spectral functions @xmath39 .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath68 is obtained from the lowest pole of @xmath69 at @xmath12 , which corresponds to a non - magnetic ground state .",
    "using eq.([eq : pi ] ) , one gets the following equation for @xmath68 : @xmath70 with @xmath48 calculated at @xmath12 , where @xmath68 is real .",

    "kondo temperature \" @xmath7 , which is defined by the difference between the ground state energy @xmath68 and the lowest excited state energy @xmath76 , characterizes the low temperature and low energy properties of the model .",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath72 calculated in this fashion reproduce the exact @xmath11 ground state and the excited state energy , respectively , obtained by the variational approach  @xcite .    to get @xmath68 ,",
    "one should solve numerically the set of coupled integral equations involving the vertex function @xmath64 .",
    "note that in the infinite-@xmath0 case , @xmath77 . to solve the equation , we have devised two simple approximations , which can be readily applied to anisotropic systems without much computational efforts . in @xmath64 ,",
    "there are two independent energy variables , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . while @xmath64 has a large dependence on @xmath78 near @xmath80 , due to @xmath81 in the integrand of the eq.([eq : vertex ] ) , it has relatively a weak dependence on @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath79 dependence of @xmath64 exists only in @xmath82",
    ". this dependence would be weaker for larger @xmath0 .",
    "thus we replace @xmath83 in the integrand by @xmath84 to avoid solving the coupled integral equations .",
    "actually , this corresponds to neglecting some energy conservation of diagrams for vertex function in fig.1 .",
    "however , owing to the weak dependence on @xmath79 of the eq.([eq : vertex ] ) , this approximation turns out to be quite good , as will be shown below .",
    "the resulting equation reads    @xmath85    where @xmath86    now eq.([eq : vertex2 ] ) is merely a linear algebraic equation of @xmath64 s for given energy variables @xmath87 .",
    "this is our first approximation ( i ) .",
    "the equation can be further simplified by representing the pseudo - fermion green s function as    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the renormalization coefficient at @xmath90 defined by @xmath91    this representation is quite reasonable , since the incoherent background of @xmath92 for large @xmath0 is located at very high energy ( @xmath93 ) as compared to @xmath72 , and the weight of the incoherent part ( @xmath94 ) would be very small ( note that it becomes zero for infinite @xmath0 ) . thus representing @xmath92 by eq.([eq : gf ] )",
    "makes no practical difference in evaluating eq.([eq : lambda ] ) for large @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath95 in eq.([eq : lambda ] ) can be obtained analytically at @xmath12 , @xmath96 this is our second approximation ( ii ) .",
    "the present approximation schemes yield fairly good results of the ground state energy @xmath68 and the kondo temperature @xmath7 for @xmath97ev . as shown in fig.[fig : kondo ] , in the large @xmath0 limit ( @xmath98 ) , the kondo temperature as a function of @xmath99 increases or decreases depending on the parameters , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "results obtained by using both approximations ( i and ii ) are close to those obtained by using the approximation ( i ) only .",
    "furthermore , both results are in good agreement with those of the exact @xmath11 variational approach .",
    "this demonstration indicates that the approximations ( i ) and ( ii ) we employed are very reasonable at least relatively large @xmath0 .",
    "deviations from the variational calculations for smaller @xmath0 appear because the approximation schemes made above become less exact for smaller value of @xmath0 , as pointed out above .",
    "we used in fig.[fig : kondo ] quite a large value of the half - bandwidth @xmath103ev .",
    "one can conjecture that the approximation ( i ) works better for a realistic smaller bandwidth , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath104 , because , for smaller @xmath102 , the @xmath105-dependence of the vertex function @xmath106 in the integrand of eq.([eq : vertex ] ) would be weaker .",
    "with the approximation schemes described in the previous section , we investigate effects of the external magnetic field in the finite-@xmath0 impurity anderson model . by applying the external field @xmath107 to a degenerate system ( @xmath108 )",

    "using the kondo temperature @xmath7 rescaled by @xmath0 , the scaling of eq.([eq : kondoh ] ) will be also valid in the finite-@xmath0 case .",
    "the impurity contribution to the magnetization @xmath117 of the system can be obtained from the relation @xmath118 the ground state is no longer non - magnetic in the presence of the magnetic field , since the field polarizes both the impurity electrons and the conduction electrons . in fig.[fig : mag0 ] , the ground state impurity magnetization @xmath119 is plotted as a function of @xmath120 .",

    "the susceptibility in our treatment is given by @xmath125 for @xmath126 . by considering the relationship between two energy scales",
    ", it is possible to compare our results with the bethe ansatz results . as is seen in fig.[fig : mag0 ] , the present results of @xmath119 agree quite well with the bethe ansatz results in the low field region , even though they are a bit overestimated in the high field region .",
    "the deviation from the exact results at high field indicates that the @xmath14 expansion may not work well in the high field region . as mentioned previously , the applied field splits the @xmath5-level and reduces the effective degeneracy , and so the lowest order @xmath14 expansion becomes invalid in the high field region .",
    "it is noteworthy that the overestimation of @xmath119 observed in fig.[fig : mag0 ] is also found in the infinite-@xmath0 nca scheme for large @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature is found in the low field magnetization .",
    "the inset of fig.[fig : mag0 ] indicates that the low field magnetization increases more rapidly than linearly in @xmath13 .",
    "this deviation from the linearity , so called the  superlinear \" behavior , has been reported by hewson _",
    "@xcite , based on the bethe ansatz solution of the coqblin - schrieffer model .",
    "they found that the superlinearity occurs for @xmath128 , and that the experimental results of ybcual are well described by their @xmath129 model .",
    "the superlinearity is also revealed by the finite temperature nca scheme  @xcite as well as by the mean field approximation  @xcite in the infinite-@xmath0 , large-@xmath1 treatments of the anderson model .",
    "the superlinear behavior has its origin in the fact that the kondo resonance , which is located near @xmath7 above the fermi level , becomes narrower as @xmath1 increases .",
    "that is , the kondo resonance is sharply defined for large @xmath1 , implying a strong screening effect . as a consequence , the spin polarization does not begin to dominate , until the magnetic field becomes comparable to @xmath7 .",
    "as the zeeman energy is comparable to @xmath130 , the magnetic field overcomes the screening by conduction electrons , and the spin polarization dominates the system .",
    "it is quite natural that the superlinearity is present in our finite-@xmath0 model , in view of the almost perfect scaling of @xmath119 in the low field regime .",
    "the superlinearity persists at low @xmath131 , but disappears at higher temperature because of suppression of the kondo resonance .    at finite temperature",
    ", the situation is more intriguing . for a given low @xmath116",
    ", @xmath119 shows a reupturn at a certain field @xmath132 ( denoted by arrows in fig.[fig : magt ] ) , apart from the superlinearity at lower field . making more investigation into this anomaly",
    ", one could find that the kondo temperature at the reupturn point is nearly equal to a given temperature of the system , that is , @xmath133 .",
    "this phenomenon could be understood as follows . for a given low @xmath116",
    ", @xmath119 has a superlinearity at low @xmath13 , but diminishes its increasing rate for intermediate values of @xmath13 . as @xmath13 increases further , @xmath119 exhibits a reupturn at @xmath134 which fulfills @xmath133 .",
    "it takes place because the population in the lowest excited magnetic state increases abruptly at the point satisfying @xmath133 , producing observed reupturns at @xmath132 .",
    "it is shown in fig.[fig : magt ] that the reupturn smears out at higher temperature , since the kondo resonance is suppressed at high temperature .",
    "another thing to note is that the scaling of @xmath119 at finite @xmath116 is not so good as that at @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig : magu ] present @xmath119 for @xmath135ev at various temperatures .",
    "non - monotonicity as a function of @xmath116 is apparent in the low field magnetization . with increasing the temperature , @xmath119 for a given small @xmath13 , which is proportional to magnetic susceptibility , increases first at low @xmath116 , but after reaching a maximum at an intermediate @xmath136",
    ", @xmath119 decreases at higher @xmath116 ( see the inset of the fig.[fig : magu ] ) .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility is known to be more pronounced for a system with larger @xmath1  @xcite , and is considered to have the same origin as that of the superlinearity in @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the finite-@xmath0 impurity anderson model in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "large-@xmath1 expansion considering @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 subspaces in the slave boson representation is employed to take into account finite-@xmath0 effects .",
    "the lowest order treatment gives rise to a complicated vertex function in the empty boson self - energy and a renormalization of @xmath5-level energies .",
    "we have devised two simple approximation schemes to evaluate the vertex function .",
    "one consists in transforming the integral equation into an algebraic equation by assuming that the vertex function has a weak dependence on one of two energy variables .",
    "the other is to simplify the pseudo - fermion green s function by neglecting the incoherent part .",
    "these approximations reduce computational efforts substantially , and are shown to yield fairly good results for @xmath97ev .",

    "it is found that the kondo temperature is reduced by the magnetic field . scaling behaviors in the field dependence of the kondo temperature and the impurity magnetization",
    "are found to hold almost perfectly at low field and low temperature .",
    "this implies that the main effect of the finite-@xmath0 in the presence of the magnetic field is manifested through the renormalization of the kondo temperature .",
    "some intriguing features are found in the field dependence of the magnetization , such as superlinearity at low field and reupturns at a higher field @xmath132 for a given low temperature , which are expected to occur from a competition between the singlet binding energy and the zeeman energy gain of electrons .",

    "<S> further , some interesting features are found in the field dependence of the impurity magnetization at finite temperature , the physical implications of which are discussed in terms of the renormalized kondo temperature . </S>"
