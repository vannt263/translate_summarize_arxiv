    "<S> we discuss topics related to the geometry of theta characteristics on algebraic curves . </S>",
    "<S> they include the birational classification of the moduli space @xmath0 of spin curves of genus @xmath1 , interpretation of theta characteristics as quadrics in a vector space over the field with two elements as well as the connection with modular forms and superstring scattering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the historical development of the subject .    </S>",
    "<S> [ multiblock footnote omitted ]    theta characteristics appeared for the first time in the context of characteristic theory of odd and even theta functions in the papers of gpel @xcite and rosenhain @xcite on jacobi s inversion formula for genus @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> they were initially considered in connection with _ </S>",
    "<S> riemann s bilinear addition _ relation between the degree two monomials in theta functions with characteristics . later , in order to systematize the relations between theta constants , frobenius @xcite , @xcite developed an algebra of characteristics ; he distinguished between _ period _ and _ theta _ characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the distinction , which in modern terms amounts to the difference between the _ prym _ moduli space @xmath3 and the _ spin _ moduli space @xmath4 , played a crucial role in elucidating the transformation law for theta functions under a linear transformation of the moduli , and it ultimately led to a correct definition of the action of symplectic group @xmath5 on the set of characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> an overwiew of the 19th century theory of theta functions can be found in krazer s monumental book @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a very analytic treatise in character , with most geometric applications either completely absent relegated to footnotes .    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable book @xcite by coble represents a departure from the analytic view towards a more abstract understanding of theta characteristics using configurations in finite geometry . </S>",
    "<S> coble viewed theta characteristics as quadrics in a vector space over @xmath6 . in this language frobenius </S>",
    "<S> earlier concepts ( syzygetic and azygetic triples , fundamental systems of characteristics ) have an elegant translation . </S>",
    "<S> with fashions in algebraic geometry drastically changing , the work of coble was forgotten for many decades .    </S>",
    "<S> the modern theory of theta characteristic begins with the works of atiyah @xcite and mumford @xcite ; they showed , in the analytic ( respectively algebraic ) category , that the parity of a theta characteristic is stable under deformations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , mumford s functorial view of the subject , opened up the way to extending the study of theta characteristics to singular curves ( achieved by harris @xcite ) , to constructing a proper deligne - mumford moduli space of stable spin curves ( carried out by cornalba @xcite ) , or to reinterpreting coble s work in modern terms ( see the book @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to survey various developments concerning the geometry of moduli spaces of spin curves . </S>",
    "<S> particular emphasis is placed on the complete birational classification of both the even and the odd spin moduli spaces , which has been carried out in the papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precisely , we shall explain the following result :    the birational type of the moduli spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 of even and odd spin curves of genus @xmath1 can be summarized as follows :    @xmath7 :     [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we describe the structure of the paper . in the first two sections we recall the interpretation of theta characteristics as quadrics in an @xmath6-vector space , then link this description both with the classical theory of characteristics of theta functions and modern developments inspired by string theory . in the next three sections we explain some features of the geometry of the moduli space @xmath9 of stable spin curves of genus @xmath1 , discuss ways of constructing effective divisors on @xmath9 and computing their cohomology classes , then finally present unirational parametrizations of the moduli space in small genus , by using mukai models and special @xmath10 surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we close by surveying a few open problems related to syzygies of theta characteristics and stratifications of the moduli space . </S>"
