    "this paper is based on a preliminary remark by w. kohn,@xcite about a general concept called  nearsightedness of electronic matter ( nem ) \" and on a recent short report ( pk),@xcite which amplified that remark in various aspects but did not include detailed proofs . in the present paper , we select that part of pk dealing with non - interacting 1d electrons and provide a full discussion , including detailed proofs .",
    "future publications will amplify other sections of pk .    by  electronic matter \" we understand a system of many electrons with significant wavefunction overlap , in equilibrium under the action of a given external potential @xmath7 .",
    "we shall consider the change of a local electronic property , like the electron density @xmath1 , under the action of an arbitrarily strong potential perturbation @xmath8 , which vanishes inside a specified sphere , @xmath9 .",
    "note that we allow situations when the perturbation completely surrounds the point @xmath0 .",
    "nem states that the resulting density change at @xmath0 , @xmath10 , is bounded by a function @xmath11 , @xmath12 independent of the amplitude or shape of @xmath8 , and that @xmath13 provided only that the chemical potential @xmath14 is held fixed .",
    "the essence of nem is contained in eq .",
    "( [ nem1 ] ) .",
    "although it may not look very special , consider our perturbing potential @xmath8 , confined outside the sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "the common sense says that , as we increase its strength , we need to increase the radius @xmath15 if we want to maintain its effect at the center of the sphere below a certain level .",
    "the common sense also says that we need to increase @xmath15 to infinity as we make @xmath8 stronger and stronger .",
    "in reality , this is not so : if the chemical potential is kept fixed , these effects will saturate and , in fact , no matter what @xmath8 we put outside the sphere of radius @xmath15 , they can not exceed a certain upper bound , which we will determine in this paper .    for a given @xmath6 , we can solve for @xmath3 in @xmath16 and define the nearsightedness range @xmath5 .",
    "the significance of @xmath17 is the following : any perturbation beyond @xmath17 , of arbitrary shape and amplitude , can not produce a density change at @xmath0 larger than @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath17 provides a simple , quantitative measure of nearsightedness .",
    "the above formulation of nem often reminds people of thomas - fermi screening , sometimes even when we discuss insulators .",
    "however , let us point a few facts . if one puts a charge inside the uniform charged electron gas and calculates the density response , he will find that the thomas - fermi exponential screening is valid only very near the impurity .",
    "further away from the impurity , he will see friedel oscillations , decaying as an inverse power law.@xcite these oscillations are not negligible .",
    "in fact , the friedel oscillations were observed experimentally , thought not directly , one year after their theoretical prediction.@xcite however , this was not realized until much later , when walter kohn made the connection between the two results.@xcite he showed that there is a big discrepancy between the prediction of the thomas - fermi screening theory and these experimental results and that a self - consistent calculation along friedel s lines , of the density change due to impurities in coper , brings the theory and experiment to almost perfect agreement .",
    "the picture that emerged was that , in the asymptotic region , the screening only renormalizes the amplitude of the friedel oscillations .",
    "the whole issue was considered very important at that time , because it clearly demonstrated the existence of a sharp fermi surface in real metals .",
    "we also like to mention one very well known fact in surface physics , where self - consistent calculations of metallic surfaces showed that the effective potential goes to the bulk value extremely fast , typically within one or two layers .",
    "however , the density oscillations extend much further into the bulk and they can be viewed as the friedel oscillations generated by the screened surface potential . with these",
    "being said , we hope that the reader will dissociate , right from the begenning , nem from the thomas - fermi exponential screening and the nearsightedness range from the thomas - fermi screening length .",
    "quantum gases display non - local density responses to local perturbations because of two factors .",
    "first , the effect of any local perturbation propagates to further distances through inter - particle interactions .",
    "this effect can be regarded as classical , since it manifests , in the same way , in classical gasses .",
    "secondly , there is a purely quantum effect , that steams directly from the uncertainity principle .",
    "this paper is concerned with this purely quantum effect , so it neglegts the inter - particle interation effects , entirely .",
    "the fact that nem exists for non - interacting systems is extremely important . to understand why",
    ", let us go back in time and recall that , at the beginning of the electronic structure calculations , when the exact diagonalization was the method of choice , people were facing the so called `` exponential wall '' when trying to extend the calculations to larger systems : because the number of operations in such calculations scales exponentially with the number of atoms , @xmath18 , their applicability was , and is still limited to systems containg a few tens of atoms .",
    "density functional theory ( dft)@xcite provided a powerful alternative : because the number of operations in dft calculations scales as @xmath19 , we can now solve the electronic structure for systems containing hundreds of atoms .",
    "however , electronic structure calculations for biological and nano systems , or for extremely complex materials , involve thousands of atoms . at this scale , we start feeling the `` @xmath19 wall . ''",
    "_ ab - initio _ quantum calculation for such complex systems will require a new generation of dft algorithms , scaling linearly with the number of atoms .",
    "it is now generally accepted that nem is the physical basis for these algorithms.@xcite    the quest for linearly scaling algorithms was initiated by w.t .",
    "yang , who was the first to argue that o(n ) algorithms are possible.@xcite the algorithm proposed by yang is known by the name of divide and conquer ( dc ) .",
    "there are now several reviews on the linear scaling electronic structure calculations .",
    "we will mention here the one by goedecker@xcite and the one by wu and jayanthi,@xcite which , at the time of their publication , gave an exhaustive discussion of o(n ) methodologies .",
    "if we examine carefully these methodologies , they are all based on the same original idea , namely gluing together calculations done for smaller systems . what is different , is the representation and the way the size of these smaller systems ( the truncation ) is determined .",
    "for example , the real space approaches will use the decay of the density matrix while the localized basis set approaches will use the overlap of these functions to judge how large these subsystems should be .",
    "let us focus on the original implementation given by yang.@xcite consider a self - consistent dft iteration process , for a large quantum system .",
    "each iterative step consists in calculating the density of a non - interacting electron gas in equilibrium under a given effective potential ( known from the previous iteration ) . in traditional approaches , this requires a number of operations that scales as @xmath19 .",
    "dc algorithm , if it works as it is supposed to , requires a number of operations that scales linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "it goes like this : the large system is devided in non - overlaping sub - regiones , which are then surrounded with buffer zones . a global chemical potential , @xmath14 ,",
    "is fixed and the orbitals are calculated and populated up to @xmath14 , for each sub - region + buffer zone .",
    "the density in the buffer zones is discarded so , at this point , one has calculated a density for each sub - region and , by putting together all these sub - densities , one can construct the global density .",
    "the charge neutrality condition is then checked for this global density and the chemical potential is adjusted , if necessary .",
    "note that charge neutrality must be satisfied by the entire system , not by each subsystem . in this way we have completed the dft iteration step in a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system .",
    "now , the question is how accurate is this algorithm ?",
    "in fact , the most important question is , can we obtain arbitrary accuracy with this algorithm ? to answer , we need to compare the density calculated for a sub - region + buffer zone and the density calculated for the entire system at once , at the _ same _ chemical potential @xmath14 .",
    "now one can see why nem can be regarded as the basis for this algorithm : the artificial termination at the outer boundary of the buffer zone , no matter how it is done , represents the change in the effective potential in our formulation of nem .",
    "for example , such changes of the effective potential occure when one calculates the density matrix and ignores the points outside a sub - region , or when one calculates the density and ignores the elements of a localized basis set that are centered outside a sub - region . since we have no control on how the effective potential is modified by such truncations , eq .",
    "( [ nem1 ] ) is paramount : it tells us that the effects of any artificial termination can not exceed an upper bound .",
    "this upper bound is an intrinsic characteristic of the system : is independent of the method of termination .",
    "( [ nem2 ] ) tells us that , if we take the buffer zones large enough , the difference between the sub - density and the real density can be made smaller than any desired accuracy .",
    "examples and estimates of the width of the buffer zones , together with a discussion of how to optimize this algorithm in 1 , 2 and 3d and how the cpu time scales with the the desired accuracy can be found in ref .  .",
    "we also like to mention that dc has been recently implemented to systems containing as many as 65,000 atoms and shown that it can generate electronic structures of the same quality as a traditional approach will do for a system of , let us say , 10 atoms.@xcite the tests performed in this numerical work agree qualitatively with our theoretical predictions .",
    "there is another important issue related to dc .",
    "the ground energy in dft is given by : @xmath20-\\int v_{xc}(r)n(r)-\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{n(r)n(r')}{|r - r'|}.\\ ] ] all the above terms can be calculated directly from the density , except the first one . however , this term is just the integral of the energy density , @xmath21 and we will show that @xmath22 is also nearsighted . as a consequence , within the dc algorithm , @xmath22 can be calculated with arbitrary precision , like the density .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold .",
    "we want to prove nem , i.e. eqs .  ( [ nem1 ] ) and ( [ nem2 ] ) , for a simple system , which is the 1d non - interacting , spin @xmath23 fermions , in periodic potentials , and also want to show that one can obtain exact estimates of the nearsightedness range , which is extremely important for dc .",
    "the case of 1d non - interacting electrons is important for several reasons .",
    "inspite of its simplicity , it captures all the important aspects of nearsightedness .",
    "this allows for a thorough investigation of nem , while keeping the technical aspects at a reasonable level .",
    "the 1d non - interacting case is relevant for linear molecular chains when treated within dft .",
    "we shall first develop general tools that will allow us to compute , for arbitrary perturbations , the asymptotic behavior of the density change , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the wave functions and the corresponding energies of the unperturbed and perturbed systems , respectively .",
    "the factor 2 in front of the sums comes from the spin .",
    "the above expression is not very useful when dealing with the asymptotic behavior of @xmath27 .",
    "instead , we will work with an integral representation .",
    "why an integral representation ?",
    "for answer , we point to the theory of special functions , where the functions are most often defined and introduced as infinite series but , with no exception , their asymptotic behavior is derived from equivalent integral representations .    we can obtain an integral representation of @xmath27 by using the green s functions . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the green s functions of the unperturbed and perturbed systems , respectively , then @xmath30(x , x ) \\ de,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a contour in the complex energy plane , surrounding the occupied states .",
    "this can be seen from the eigenfunction expansions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the residue theorem .",
    "now , the eigenfunction expansions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , again , not very useful . instead , we will use the following compact representation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the solutions of the schrodinger equation at energy @xmath39 , satisfying the boundary condition to the left and right , respectively , and @xmath40 is the wronskian of the two solutions . for infinite systems , the case considered in this paper , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the solutions decaying at @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath39 does not belong to the energy spectrum .",
    "when the contour @xmath31 intersects the energy spectrum , such as for the case of metals , @xmath33 will have a discontinuity at the point of intersection . strictly speaking",
    ", this point must be excluded from @xmath31 , which does not change the result of the integration .",
    "for all the other points of @xmath31 , @xmath33 is uniquely defined and given by eq .",
    "( [ sturm ] ) .",
    "later , we will use the reflection and transmission coefficients to construct extremely simple and compact expressions of the green s functions ( see eqs .",
    "( [ greenf ] ) , ( [ fundamental ] ) and ( [ diffg ] ) ) .",
    "the last step of our strategy will be to identify the special point in the complex energy plane that determines the asymptotic behavior of the integral eq .",
    "( [ intg ] ) .",
    "this strategy will require from us to go into the complex energy plane .",
    "we will make use of the analytic structure of the bloch functions and band energies derived in ref .",
    ", which is briefly discussed in the next section .",
    "these analytic structure results can be generalized to linear molecular chains and even to 3d crystals.@xcite also , the above expression for the green s function , eq .",
    "( [ sturm ] ) , can be generalized to linear molecular chains,@xcite or to 3d crystals.@xcite in fact , the entire strategy can be applied in 2 and 3d , as it was already shown in ref .  .",

    "<S> nem can be quantitatively characterized by the nearsightedness range , @xmath5 , defined as the smallest distance from @xmath0 , beyond which _ any _ change of the external potential produces a density change , at @xmath0 , smaller than a given @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper gives a detailed analysis of nem for periodic metals and insulators in 1d and includes sharp , explicit estimates of the nearsightedness range . </S>",
    "<S> since nem involves arbitrary changes of the external potential , strong , even qualitative changes can occur in the system , such as the quantization of the energy bands or the filling of the insulating gap of an insulator with continuum spectrum . in spite of such drastic changes , </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath4 has only a limited effect on the density , which can be quantified in terms of simple parameters of the unperturbed system . </S>"
