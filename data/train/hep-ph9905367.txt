    "to describe multiplicity fluctuations in angular regions by analytical calculations using perturbative qcd is a challenge . it could help to improve our understanding of the parton cascading mechanism and",
    "might lead to a simple description of multiparticle correlations by qcd alone .",
    "the idea that qcd jets might exhibit a self - similar ( or fractal ) structure was brought up already in 1979 by r.p.feynman  @xcite , a.giovannini  @xcite and g.veneziano  @xcite . in recent years",
    "this conception has been confirmed by various groups @xcite , giving detailed predictions on variables and phase space regions where fractality is expected to show up .",
    "a simple predicted dependence of the fractal dimensions on @xmath1 stimulated further interest in measuring them experimentally .",
    "the analytical calculations are performed in the double log approximation ( dla )  @xcite , neglecting energy - momentum conservation , and concern only idealized jets .",
    "they provide leading order predictions applicable quantitatively at very high energies ( @xmath2 1  tev ) @xcite . at lep energies",
    ", non - perturbative effects may be important .",
    "also , they refer to multiparton states , whereas only multihadron states can be measured .",
    "it has been suggested that the parton evolution should be extended from the perturbative regime down to a lower mass scale ( if possible to the mass scale of light hadrons ) to be able to compare the partonic states directly with the hadronic states .",
    "this concept of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) @xcite is quite successful for single particle distributions and for global moments of multiplicity distributions .",
    "it remains questionable in the case of the more refined variables used here , namely factorial moments and cumulants in phase space bins .",
    "first experimental measurements  @xcite revealed , indeed , substantial deviations .    on the other hand",
    "it can be expected that these calculations will improve in the future .",
    "this would provide us with a better understanding of the internal structure of jets in terms of analytical expressions than can be obtained by monte carlo calculations with many parameters .",
    "in fact , the analytical predictions considered in this paper involve only one adjustable parameter , namely the qcd scale @xmath3 .",
    "the aim of this study is to use delphi data to measure multiplicity fluctuations in one- and two - dimensional angular intervals and compare them with the available theoretical predictions .",
    "it is hoped that such a study may show how to approach nearer to a satisfying theory based on qcd and lphd which describes high energy multiparticle phenomena .    in section 2",
    "the theoretical framework is sketched , section 3 contains information about the experimental data and the monte carlo comparisons and in section 4 the comparison with the analytical calculations is presented .",
    "section 5 contains the final discussion and the summary .",
    "the theoretical calculations treat correlations between partons emitted within an angular window defined by two angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the parton and particle density correlations ( fluctuations ) in this window are described by normalized factorial moments of order @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the @xmath6-parton / particle density correlation functions which depend on the spherical angles @xmath9 .",
    "the integrals extend over the window chosen .",
    "the angular windows considered here are either rings around the jet axis with mean opening angle @xmath10 and half width @xmath4 in the case of 1 dimension ( @xmath11 ) , or cones with half opening angle @xmath4 around a direction ( @xmath12 ) with respect to the jet axis in the case of 2 dimensions ( @xmath13 ) . at sufficiently large jet energies ,",
    "the parton flow in these angular windows is dominated by parton avalanches caused by gluon bremsstrahlung off the initial quark .",
    "the cumulants @xmath14 are obtained from the moments @xmath15 by simple algebraic equations  @xcite , e.g. @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the theoretical scheme for deriving the moments described above is based on the generating functional techniques @xcite in the dla of perturbative qcd .",
    "the probability of radiating a gluon with momentum @xmath18 at an emission angle @xmath19 and azimuthal angle @xmath20 from an initial parton @xmath21 has been approximated by @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 = 1 if @xmath21 is a gluon and @xmath24 = 4/9 if @xmath21 is a quark .",
    "@xcite derived their predictions explicitly for cumulant moments @xmath14 , whereas  @xcite and  @xcite obtained similar expressions for the factorial moments @xmath15 .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite by monte carlo calculations that , at very high energy ( @xmath25  gev ) , the values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 converge to each other . at lep energies ,",
    "however , the cumulants are still far away from the asymptotic predictions ( see section 4 ) .    for the normalized cumulant moments @xmath14  @xcite and the factorial moments @xmath15  @xcite",
    ", the following prediction has been made : @xmath26 all 3 references  @xcite give in the high energy limit and for large values of @xmath27 the same linear approximation for the exponents @xmath28 : @xmath29 where d is a dimensional factor , 1 for ring regions and 2 for cones . for fixed @xmath1 ( along the parton shower )",
    "eq .  5 is asymptotically valid for angles . in this case",
    "the fractal ( renyi- ) dimension @xmath30  @xcite can be obtained  @xcite from @xmath28 ( eq .  5 ) via :    @xmath31    when the running of @xmath32 with @xmath4 in the parton cascade is taken into account , in @xcite the following was obtained    @xmath33    @xmath34    and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the momentum of the initial parton .",
    "the dependence on the qcd parameters @xmath1 or @xmath3 enters in the above equations via @xmath37 and @xmath38 that are determined by the scale @xmath39 . in the present study it is about 20 gev for @xmath40=91.1  gev .    the corresponding predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite ( eq .  11 ) and  @xcite ( eq .",
    "12 ) are analytically different , but numerically similar :    @xmath41    @xmath42    it should be noted that all three theoretical papers cited above use the lowest order qcd relation ( 13 ) between the coupling @xmath1 and the qcd scale @xmath3 , which is also used in the present analysis : @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45=3 ( number of colours ) .",
    "these relations depend also on the number of flavours ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "since eq .",
    "13 emerges only from `` one loop '' calculations , the parameter @xmath3 is not the universal @xmath47 , but only an effective parameter @xmath48 . but also in this approximation @xmath1 runs , having a scale dependence @xmath49 .",
    "the running of @xmath1 during the process of jet cascading is implicitly taken into account in ( 8) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) by the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath38 ( or @xmath4 ) . in theory",
    "this causes a deviation from a potential behaviour ( eqs .  4 and 5 ) of @xmath15 when approaching smaller values of @xmath4 ( larger @xmath38 ) .",
    "all theoretical predictions concern the partonic states .",
    "the corresponding experimental measurements , however , are of hadronic states .",
    "when comparing them , the hypothesis of lphd has to be used .",
    "it may be noted that the factorial moments @xmath15 measured in the present study ( see also eq .  15 below )",
    "are very similar to the well known and previously measured moments in rapidity space . here",
    "the angle @xmath4 is used ( translated by constant factors into @xmath38 ) , because this is the natural variable in the qcd calculations .",
    "the normalized factorial moments ( 1 ) are determined experimentally by counting @xmath50 , the number of charged particles in the respective windows of phase space , for each event : @xmath51 where the brackets @xmath52 denote averages over the whole event sample .",
    "the data sample used contains about 600000 @xmath0 interactions ( after cuts ) collected by delphi at @xmath53  gev in 1994 . a sample of about 1200 high energy events at @xmath40=183  gev incident energy collected in 1997 is used to investigate the energy dependence .",
    "the calculated hadron energy was required to be greater than 162  gev ( corresponding to a mean energy of 175  gev ) .",
    "the standard cuts as in @xcite for hadronic events and track quality were applied by demanding a minimum charged multiplicity , enough visible charged energy and events well contained within the detector volume . in the present study all charged particles ( except identified electrons and muons ) with momentum larger than 0.1  gev",
    "have been considered .",
    "the special procedures for selecting high energy events are described in @xcite .",
    "ww - events have been excluded .",
    "detailed monte carlo studies were done using the jetset 7.4 ps model  @xcite .",
    "the corrections were determined using events from a jetset monte carlo simulation which had been tuned ( @xmath3=0.346  gev and @xmath54=2.25  gev ) to reproduce general event characteristics  @xcite , which included variables different from those referred to in section 2 .",
    "these events were examined at    * * generator level * + where all charged final  state particles ( except electrons and muons ) with a mean lifetime longer than @xmath55 seconds have been considered ; * * detector level * + which includes distortions due to particle decays and interactions with the detector material , other imperfections such as limited resolution , multi  track separation and detector acceptance , and the event selection procedures .    using these events , the factorial moments and cumulants introduced in section 2 of order @xmath6 , @xmath56 , studied below",
    "were corrected ( for each @xmath38 interval considered ) by    @xmath57    where the superscript `` raw '' indicates the quantities calculated directly from the data , and `` gen '' and `` det '' denote those obtained from the monte carlo events at generator and detector level respectively .",
    "the simulated data at detector level were found to agree satisfactorily with the experimental data .",
    "the measurement error on the relative angle @xmath58 between two outgoing particles was determined to be of order @xmath59 ( if both tracks had good vertex detector hits , even as small as @xmath60 ) .",
    "the jet axis is chosen to be the sphericity axis .",
    "to increase statistics in the case of the high energy sample the moments ( 15 ) have been calculated in both sphericity hemispheres and averaged .",
    "in addition , all phenomena which were not included in the analytical calculations had to be corrected for , namely ( i ) initial state photon radiation , ( ii ) dalitz decays of the @xmath61 , ( iii ) residual @xmath62 and @xmath63 decays near the vertex , and ( iv ) the effect of bose  einstein correlations .",
    "the corrections were estimated , for each @xmath38 interval , like @xmath64 in eq .",
    "16 , by switching the effects on and off .",
    "each of these correction factors were found to be below 10% in the case of factorial moments .",
    "the largest corrections have been found in the case of cumulants of higher orders and amounted to 1625% , depending on the analysis angle .",
    "the total correction factor including all effects is denoted by @xmath65 and is the product of the individual factors .",
    "systematic errors have been calculated from @xmath65 according to @xmath66 . due to uncertainties in measuring multiple tracks at very small separation angles ,",
    "an additional systematic error was added for small @xmath4 values for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "1 shows a comparison at @xmath40=91.1  gev of the measured 1-dimensionel cumulants and 1- and 2-dimensional factorial moments with jetset 7.4 tuned as described above .",

    "there exist two attempts for improvement .",

    "@xcite , modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) corrections have been calculated for the intermittency exponents @xmath28 .",

    "the deviations observed in fig",
    ".  5 are much larger .    in a second attempt ,",
    "meunier and peschanski  @xcite introduced energy conservation terms explicitly .",
    "this leads , however , to even smaller predicted slopes @xmath28 and consequently larger values of @xmath37 , increasing the discrepancies shown in table 3 and fig .",
    "no angular recoil effects were included in these calculations .",
    "recently meunier  @xcite proposed to use , instead of the evolution variable @xmath92 , the variable @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the mean multiplicities in the first @xmath38 bin ( @xmath96 ) and in the @xmath97 bins respectively . using this new variable ,",
    "the discrepancies of the 1-dimensional factorial moments observed so far are reduced by almost a factor 2  see fig .",
    "5b  and the @xmath6-dependence is less strong .",
    "the discrepancy between the 1- and 2-dimensional moments , however , is increased ( fig .",
    "whether the use of the evolution variable @xmath98 is more suitable than the angular evolution variable @xmath99 , which is indicated only in the 1-dimensional case , must still remain open .",
    "another question concerns the range of validity of the lphd hypothesis , which can be studied only by using monte carlo simulations at both partonic and hadronic levels .",
    "different monte carlo models @xcite or different choices of the cut - off parameter @xmath100 at which the parton cascade is `` terminated '' , even in a moderate interval ( 0.3 - 0.6 gev ) , lead to different answers  @xcite . in the strict sense lphd",
    "demands a low cut - off scale ( @xmath101 0.2 - 0.3  gev ) @xcite . in a jetset study of the partonic state with @xmath3=0.15",
    "gev and @xmath54=0.33  gev a steeper rise of the moments than that of the hadron state is observed at small @xmath38 thus even increasing the discrepancy with the analytical predictions .",
    "these studies and the results of @xcite indicate that even a possible violation of lphd might not be the reason for the observed discrepancies .",
    "1 also shows that shape distortions due to resonance decay , although significant , are much smaller than the discrepancies between data and theoretical predictions .",
    "similarily a slightly steeper rise of moments is also observed in monte carlo studies when replacing the sphericity axis by the `` true '' @xmath102 axis and excluding initial heavy flavour production .",
    "these effects , however , are smaller than that caused by inhibiting resonance decay ( see fig .",
    "1c , d ) .",
    "this discussion suggest that the analytical calculations need to be improved beyond the above attempts .",
    "does one have a better handle to estimate how far nonperturbative effects are spoiling the agreement with the data .",
    "the importance of including angular recoil effects into the parton cascade , as it is also stressed in @xcite , is intuitively evident when analysing angular dependent functions .",
    "experimental data on multiplicity fluctuations in one- and two- dimensional angular intervals in @xmath0 annihilations into hadrons at @xmath53  gev and @xmath103  gev collected by the delphi detector have been compared with first order analytical calculations of the dla and mlla of perturbative qcd .",
    "some general features of the calculations are confirmed by the data : the factorial moments rise approximately linearly for large angles ( as expected from the multifractal nature of the parton shower ) and level off at smaller angles ; the dimensional- , order- and energy dependences are met qualitatively .    at the quantitative level , however , large deviations are observed : the cumulants are far off the predictions ; the factorial moments level off with substantially smaller radii ; even by reducing the qcd parameters @xmath3 and/or @xmath46 , the analytical calculations are not able to describe simultaneously the factorial moments at orders @xmath81 and at different dimensionalities ( 1- and 2-dimensions ) .",
    "thus an evaluation of qcd parameters from the data is not possible at present . from monte carlo studies",
    "there are indications that possible violations of lphd are not responsible for these discrepancies",
    ".    therefore these shortcomings are probably mainly due to the high energy approximation inherent in the dla ( which is most responsible for the extreme failure of calculations using cumulants ) .",
    "available mlla calculations can not substantially improve on the dla . to match the data at presently available energies ,",
    "improvements such as the inclusion of full energy - momentum conservation are needed .",
    "we are greatly indebted to our technical collaborators and to the funding agencies for their support in building and operating the delphi detector , and to the members of the cern - sl division for the excellent performance of the lep collider .",
