    "the coupling strength may be very weak when a single photon field interacts with matter , because the single photon has little intensity .",

    "we have also demonstrated that the coherent photon transfer is highly effected by the different coupling constants due to the different atomic positions in the cavity , because in such situation new coupling relationships are introduced for coherent exchange of photon between the atoms and cavity mode .",
    "we analyze the dynamical and decoherent behaviors of this system with considering the interatomic dipole - dipole interaction and interaction with the free space light modes through the open cavity , which can greatly influence the evolution of two - atom cavity system .",

    "we first analyze the role of the prepared initial quantum state and we find that the excitation atomic phases can lead to strong quantum interference effects on the cavity mode excitation .",
    "we further show that such quantum interference of the intracavity photon is not only effected by the excitation phase but also controlled by the coupling constants between atoms and cavity .",
    "when the coupling constants are different for two atoms , interesting physical phenomena are displayed in the dynamical behavior of cavity mode and atoms .",
    "all of these phenomena are caused by new coupling relationships between atoms and cavity mode .",
    "especially , when the coupling constants between atoms and cavity mode are different , the dark state of free space couples to the cavity mode and energy exchange is existed between such dark state and cavity mode .",
    "in addition , due to the existence of excitation phase the initial state can be decomposed into dark and bright states , which can present a feasible scheme to generate dark state through this two - atom cavity system using one narrowband heralded single photon .",
    "also we have found that the dipole - dipole interaction plays an important role in the photon transfer in the two - atom cavity system . in particular this interaction can influence the photon exchange and for small interaction distance it provides stronger generation of the long - lived two atomic dark states .",
    "however , clearer understanding the role of dipole - dipole interaction to the properties of two - atom cavity system requires further studies that will be a subject of future investigation .",
