    "in accreting neutron stars , the accreted hydrogen and helium burns a few hours after arriving on the star via the rp - process @xcite .",
    "the resulting ashes consist of a complex mixture of heavy elements beyond the iron group @xcite .",
    "these heavy element ashes initially form the liquid ocean of the star but upon further compression freeze to form the outer crust .",
    "the composition of the outer crust is an important quantity to understand because it sets the thermal and electrical conductivity , which determines thermal and magnetic evolution ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and determines the distribution of nuclear heat sources ( in particular , in the outer crust , electron captures onto nuclei ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that chemical separation would occur on freezing of the rp - process ashes .",
    "they used molecular dynamics simulations to compute the evolution of a representative 17-component mixture from @xcite , finding that the lighter nuclei preferentially remain in the liquid phase .",
    "@xcite developed a semi - analytic method that was able to closely reproduce these results , building on previous work on one- , two- and three - component plasmas , in particular the work of @xcite for c  o  ne mixtures .",
    "a comparison of the semi - analytic method with molecular dynamics was also carried out for mixtures of c , o and ne with application to white dwarf interiors @xcite .",
    "chemical separation in neutron star oceans has several observational implications .",
    "it can change the concentration and distribution of carbon in the ocean @xcite , which is believed to be the fuel for the energetic thermonuclear flashes known as superbursts @xcite .",
    "the release of light elements at the base of the ocean will drive convection @xcite , and can change the early lightcurve of cooling neutron stars in transiently - accreting systems that go into quiescence @xcite .",
    "chemical separation can simplify the mixture of elements that are present in the solid outer crust .",
    "the degree of scattering of electrons by impurities in the lattice is determined by the impurity parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the nuclear charge of species @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the number fraction of species @xmath5 and the sum is over all species in the mixture .",
    "the mean charge is @xmath7 .",
    "the impurity parameter can be as large as @xmath8 in the ashes of rp - process h / he burning @xcite .",
    "whether it is significantly reduced by chemical separation at the ocean floor is an important question to resolve .",
    "@xcite calculated chemical separation for one particular rp - process ash mixture .",
    "however , the rp - process can produce a variety of different compositions depending on burning conditions @xcite .",
    "an open question is to what extent chemical separation occurs for these different mixtures of nuclei .",
    "the semi - analytic method of @xcite enables the phase diagram of a mixture to be calculated much more rapidly than a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "we take advantage of this here to calculate chemical separation for a variety of different rp - process ashes . rather than considering arbitrary mixtures",
    ", we use a range of heavy element mixtures resulting from calculations of hydrogen and helium burning involving the rp - process . in  2 , we calculate the liquid and solid compositions in equilibrium for different initial mixtures . in  3 , we discuss the implications of our results for observations .",
    "we adopt realistic mixtures that result from calculations of rp - process burning under different conditions .",
    "an important factor is whether the hydrogen and helium burning is thermally stable or unstable .",
    "@xcite calculated the ashes of stable burning , and showed that the composition for accretion rates @xmath9 has a range of mean nuclear charge from @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "we focus on the nuclear charge @xmath1 rather than mass @xmath12 because that is the relevant quantity for freezing of a coulomb liquid .",
    "the composition becomes heavier at larger accretion rates , up to a limit at @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the local eddington accretion rate ) beyond which the mixture reaches nuclear statistical equilibrium , driving the mixture back to iron group ( this effect can be seen in figs .",
    "7 and 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite extended these calculations to lower accretion rates below @xmath14 and showed that the composition would be much lighter , with @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "unstable burning gives a heavier composition than stable burning because it occurs at a significantly larger temperature , resulting in heavy ashes beyond the iron group with @xmath17@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently calculated the rp - process ashes for a large number of steady - state burning models with different accretion rates , base fluxes , and helium fraction in the accreted material . here",
    "we study four models from that paper which have helium - rich accreting material with helium mass fraction @xmath19=0.55 and accretion rates @xmath20 and then a series of models with @xmath19=0.2752 and @xmath21 from 0.1 to 40 .",
    "we also look at the composition used by @xcite , taken from @xcite , which was the result of unstable h / he burning , and an additional composition resulting from unstable burning .",
    "these compositions span a nuclear charge range of @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "the rp - process ashes are produced well above the ocean floor , at densities @xmath24@xmath25 . we allow for beta decays and electron captures as the ashes move to higher densities by finding the @xmath1 for each mass chain @xmath12 that is in beta equilibrium at an electron fermi energy @xmath26 , which is a typical fermi energy at the freezing depth ( for a one - component plasma , the fermi energy at the freezing depth is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ) .",
    "we have checked that our results are not sensitive to the exact choice of @xmath29 .",
    "some of the compositions contain substantial amounts of light elements helium and carbon , which are likely to burn before reaching the base of the ocean where chemical separation occurs . at lower accretion rates",
    "the validity of this assumption is much more uncertain and carbon could potentially reach the ocean basin possibly sourcing superbursts @xcite .",
    "recent multi - zone modelling of superbursts find additional crustal heating ( @xmath30 ) necessary to transition from unstable to stable burning at low accretion rates @xcite .",
    "this in conjunction with rp - process ashes with large carbon mass fractions make the assumption of complete and stable burning of carbon even more uncertain at low accretion rates . the interaction of chemical separation with rp - process ashes of these low accretion rates will be discussed further in  3 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume that light element burning converts the he and c into mg ( z=12 ) , and so set the he and c number fractions to zero , and add the sum of the original he and c number fractions to the mg number fraction .. the difference between these two reformulations have been studied and are insignificant to the general features of chemical separation considered in this paper . ]",

    "while the linear mixing rule is adequate to describe the free energy of the liquid phase , the solid phase requires a correction term be included , and so we write the liquid and solid free energies as @xmath43 extending the work of @xcite on the three - component plasma to an arbitrary number of @xmath44 components , @xcite write @xmath45 as a sum over pairwise interactions , @xmath46 where the function @xmath47 is taken from @xcite .",
    "once the free energy is obtained , we then look for an @xmath48 dimensional plane in the @xmath44 dimensional space of composition that is tangent to the free energy surfaces for the liquid and solid .",
    "this @xmath44-dimensional version of the usual tangent construction then allows one to decompose any composition that lies between the liquid and solid tangent points into coexisting phases of that liquid and solid .",
    "we calculate the liquid and solid compositions that are in equilibrium for a mixture of 50% liquid and 50% solid .",
    "we calculate the chemical separation using the 17 most abundant species from each rp - process mixture .",
    "the choice of 17 species is for convenience , since it matches the number of species in the composition used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we have checked that using a smaller or larger number of species in the calculation of chemical separation does not significantly change the results .",
    "the results for all mixtures studied in this paper ( @xmath490.55 , 0.2752@xmath34 and two x - ray burst compositions ) are summarized in table [ tab : results ] which gives the mean charge @xmath31 and impurity parameter in the initial mixture , liquid and solid for each case .",
    "the mean charge is plotted in figure [ fig : z ] . in agreement with the results of @xcite for a single mixture , we find the general result that @xmath31 increases for the solid and decreases for the liquid relative to the initial composition.=0.1 @xmath14 , y=0.2752 and @xmath50=0.5 @xmath14 , y=0.55 which produce a ` heavier ' equilibrium liquid than its solid counterpart . ]",
    "this implies that the equilibrium liquid and solid phases will be preferentially enriched in lighter and heavier nuclei respectively relative to the initial mixture .",

    "the presence of carbon in these light compositions appears to exert a strong influence on the phase separation trend of the @xmath61 plots . in the light composition regime",
    "the rp - process ashes produce substantial amounts of carbon ( @xmath78=0.42 - 0.78 ) which when included with any residual he gives less regular behaviour in the trend of @xmath61 and tends to magnify @xmath61 for certain elements .",
    "as seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : carbon ] , for these light mixtures carbon s presence significantly lightens the composition which in turn drastically increases the relative number fractions for specific elements .",

    "although these results are interesting it is unlikely that these light compositions with high carbon content reflect the actual composition undergoing phase separation at the base of a neutron star s ocean .",

    ". in general , a larger enrichment of light elements in the liquid leads to a purer solid phase .",
    "we find that the degree of chemical separation depends on the fractional spread in @xmath1 in the mixture , which we measure with the parameter @xmath81 .",

    "heavier mixtures tend to have a smaller fractional spread in @xmath1 and vice versa , with the exception of the lightest mixtures .",

    "this means that mixtures with a larger @xmath86 have a lower melting temperature and a greater degree of chemical separation .",
    "the lightest mixtures deviate from these trends because they are in the light mixture regime where the solid forms from the most abundant element . in that case",
    ", there is no longer a clean separation in @xmath1 between elements that go into the liquid and elements that go into the solid , and the degree of chemical separation is much smaller .",

    "@xcite compared their results for the 17-species mixture with a two - component model in which the chemical separation for any given element was calculated by approximating the mixture as consisting of that element plus the most abundant element ( which was se for the 17-species mixture ) .",
    "the pattern of enrichment of heavy elements in the solid and light elements in the liquid was well - reproduced by this simpler model , although with differences in the detailed values of @xmath61 .    here , we investigate how well the two - component model reproduces our results for a wider range of compositions , and extend it to include three components .",
    "figure [ fig : tcp ] compares the results from the 17-species calculation to the two- and three - component approximation for three steady - state models summarised in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "for the two - component model , we follow @xcite and calculate the equilibrium solid - to - liquid number fractions for each element assuming the plasma is composed of only two ion species , the element itself and the most abundant element in the mixture .",
    "the initial composition of the mixture is chosen such that the ratio of the abundances of the two elements is the same as the 17-component system . in the three - component approximation",
    ", we calculate @xmath61 of each element assuming the plasma is composed of the two most abundant elements in addition to the element in question .",
    "the number fractions are renormalized for each element so that its number fraction relative to the two most abundant elements agrees with the 17-component mixture .    for most of the compositions",
    "the two - component approximation tends to reproduce the general number fraction trend of the 17-component plasma with discrepancies further reduced in the three - component model , as illustrated by the two examples in the upper panels of figure [ fig : tcp ] .",
    "however , we noticed that compositions with a large @xmath86 show significant differences .",
    "in particular , the two and three - component models show the opposite trend of @xmath61 with @xmath1 compared to the 17-component calculation .",
    "this can be seen in the lower panel of figure [ fig : tcp ] .",
    "the difference arises because compositions with large @xmath86 mark the transition between the light and heavy element regimes . in this case , whereas the full composition is close to being in the heavy element regime , the two- and three - component approximations remains firmly in the light elements regime and therefore show the opposite trend .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the semi - analytic method of @xcite to a range of rp - process ash mixtures to survey the extent of chemical separation in accreting neutron stars .",
    "we find that for heavy mixtures with @xmath92 , there is a clean separation between elements with @xmath93 which are preferentially retained in the liquid , and those with @xmath94 which go into the solid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abuns ] ) .",
    "the effect is to reduce @xmath0 from @xmath95@xmath96 in the inital liquid to as low as @xmath97 in the solid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qimp ] ) .",
    "lighter mixtures generally show a similar behavior in that the liquid is lighter than the solid ( @xmath98 ) , but are different in that the preference of any given elements for liquid or solid is harder to predict . for the lightest of these mixtures ,",
    "the solid phase is dominated by the most abundant element in the mixture which can be either light or heavy relative to @xmath51 . the fractional spread in @xmath1 as measured by @xmath99",
    "plays a role in determining the amount of chemical separation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : std ] ) .",
    "the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath83 , heavy element enrichment as measured by @xmath85 , and the contrast in @xmath2 between liquid and initial mixture all increase with @xmath86 .",
    "these general behaviours may help in developing simple models of chemical separation to be used in time - dependent calculations of the evolution of accreting neutron stars where it is not feasible or possible to calculate the phase diagram for the complex mixtures of elements that are present .",
    "our results have implications for the depth of the neutron star ocean , the composition of the outer parts of the neutron star crust , and for driving convection in the neutron star ocean .",
    "one caveat is that we have calculated the liquid  solid equilibrium for a 50/50 mixture of liquid and solid , and so",
    "have not followed the complete freezing of the mixture .",
    "the depth of the ocean floor likely does not correspond to the value of @xmath57 for a 50/50 mixture , nor is the composition at the top of the crust the same as the 50/50 equilibrium solid composition .",
    "in fact , in steady state , the average composition entering the crust must be the same as the rp - process ashes entering the ocean , and therefore the @xmath0 in the outer crust would be the same on average as the rp - process ashes .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that a single phase solid with the same composition as the rp - process ashes can form .",
    "for a general multicomponent mixture , multiple solid phases are likely to form instead , with the liquid adopting the composition at the eutectic point .",
    "@xcite found this for the particular mixture they studied , and a simpler example is shown in fig .  1 of @xcite for a two - component mixture of o and se .",
    "the outer crust is therefore likely to consist of multiple solid phases .",
    "diffusion could result in the different solid phases merging in the outer crust .",
    "@xcite find a diffusion coefficient of @xmath100 at @xmath101 , just after the solid forms .",
    "since the ocean may take @xmath8 years to accrete , the diffusion length is @xmath102 close to the top of the crust .",
    "this may be enough to merge different solid phases , although the diffusion coefficient decreases sharply with density @xcite .",
    "we are not able to confidently calculate beyond the 50/50 equilibrium mixture and the possible multiphase solid composition at present , without further comparisons with molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , as the solid fraction increases the resulting compositions depend more sensitively on the particular form of @xmath45 chosen ( eq .  [ [ eq : delta_fs ] ] ) because @xmath45 dominates the free energy at large @xmath57 .",
    "it is also not clear if a steady state is reached in the outer crust , as the rp - process ashes are sensitive to variations in accretion rate onto the star .",
    "given these uncertainties , we will assume in exploring the implications of our results that the results we have obtained for 50/50 mixtures give a good estimate of the typical mixtures that make up the outer crust .",
    "further work is needed to constrain the nucleation rate of the equilibrium solid at the ocean - crust boundary .",
    "the actual equilibrium mass fraction could therefore differ substantially from the 50/50 mass fraction assumed here .",
    "the equilibrium liquid - solid compositions were also determined for the lightest mixtures ( i.e. low accretion rates",
    "@xmath103 ) assuming no burning of carbon .",
    "we find large variability in the equilibrium @xmath83 values for these mixtures ( @xmath83=265 - 626 ) which roughly equates to an order of magnitude density difference in the approximate location of the ocean - crust boundary .",
    "we also find that for the three lightest compositions , the corresponding @xmath83 values increase with @xmath51 .",
    "this result runs contrary to one - component plasmas which crystallize more readily with increase in nuclear charge .",
    "this discrepency is likely due to the increase in the contribution of the entropy of mixing term in equation ( [ eq : flm ] ) as compositions become more heterogenous with increase in accretion rate .",
    "research on the variability of the ocean - crust boundary with composition could offer opportunities to further constrain properties of cooling neutron stars post - outburst or accretion regimes of superbursting sources .",
    "the impurity parameter @xmath0 sets the electron - impurity scattering rate in the crust .",
    "whether this determines the electrical and thermal conductivities depends on how it compares to the electron - phonon scattering rate . at a density @xmath104 , impurity scattering will dominate if @xmath105 , where @xmath106 @xcite , and @xmath28 . as density increases ,",
    "impurity scattering is more likely to dominate , as the increasing debye temperature reduces the phonon - scattering contribution .",
    "constraints on the crust thermal conductivity , and therefore @xmath0 , have come from modelling the observed cooling of neutron star transients in quiescence @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed a constant @xmath0 throughout the entire crust and showed that fits to the transient sources mxb  1659 - 29 and ks  1731 - 260 required @xmath107 , even when uncertainties in the neutron star surface gravity , and therefore crust thickness , were taken into account .",
    "this upper limit is indicated by the horizontal dashed line in figure [ fig : qimp ] .",
    "@xcite noted that their constraint on @xmath0 applies to the inner crust , since electron - phonon scattering sets the conductivity in the outer crust .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in the inner crust likely does not reflect the @xmath0 of the freshly made solid at the top of the crust .",
    "@xcite modelled the evolution of multicomponent mixtures in the crust as they are compressed and undergo electron captures and neutron emissions and captures near neutron drip .",
    "those models showed a reduction in @xmath0 near neutron drip , where neutrons are able to redistribute among nuclei ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the simplification of the mixture near neutron drip means that a relatively large @xmath0 at the top of the crust could be consistent with the constraint @xmath77 from @xcite .",
    "our calculations of the mixture entering the outer crust can be used as input to calculations of the nuclear evolution through neutron drip .",
    "@xcite were able to derive constraints on the outer crust @xmath0 .",
    "they fit the neutron star transient xte  j1701 - 462 using different values of @xmath0 for the outer and inner crust and found best fitting models with @xmath108 at densities @xmath109 , transitioning to @xmath110 for @xmath111 . their constraint for the outer crust",
    "is represented by a blue shaded band in figure [ fig : qimp ] .",
    "our results in this paper show that chemical separation on freezing could explain the inferred values of @xmath0 for the outer crust .",
    "figure [ fig : qimp ] shows that the initial values of @xmath0 are larger than 30 for compositions with @xmath112 , but that most of the corresponding solid compositions have @xmath113",
    ". further work on the constraints on @xmath0 in the outer crust from other sources would be interesting .",
    "we can use our results to estimate the strength of compositionally driven convection in the neutron star ocean @xcite .",
    "the rate of buoyancy production at the ocean  crust boundary depends mostly on the difference in @xmath2 between the rp - process ash mixture and the equilibrium liquid composition .",
    "electrons dominate the pressure in the ocean ( by a factor of @xmath114 ) , so that the compositional buoyancy is dominated by the gradient of @xmath2 . in that case",
    ", we can simplify the expression for the brunt - visl frequency @xcite as @xmath115 where we have dropped the ion terms . in this limit , the expression for the convective heat flux in the ocean from @xcite ( see their equation  43 ) becomes @xmath116 this equation gives the expected heat flux for steady accretion ; in a time - dependent situation such as cooling after an accretion outburst , the @xmath50 factor should be replaced by @xmath117 , the rate of change of the column depth of the ocean floor due to temperature changes @xcite . since the pressure is dominated by relativistic degenerate electrons , @xmath118 , so that the composition enters equation ( [ eq : fconv ] ) through the factor @xmath119 .",
    "the values of @xmath2 for the initial , liquid , and solid mixtures are given in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the largest values of @xmath88 are @xmath120 .",
    "this is in the range considered by medin & cumming ( 2011 ) , who looked at two - component mixtures only for simplicity . in that paper ,",
    "steady state was defined as the point where the composition crystallizing at the bottom of the ocean matched the compostion accreting from the top .",
    "this agreement suggests that their results represent a realistic range of outcomes for compositonally - driven convection despite their two - component approximation .",
    "it is likely that the values @xmath88 tabulated in this paper provide lower bounds on the acual convective heat flux of that mixture .",
    "this is because unlike medin & cumming ( 2011 ) , the results calculated here are for a system where 50 % of the mixture crystallizes into solid .",
    "generally , this equilibrium solid state is subtantially different ( heavier ) from the initial mixture accreting at the top of the ocean .",
    "therefore we expect further phase separation and enrichment of the ocean in light elements to arrive closer to the steady state of medin & cumming ( 2011 ) .",
    "se mixture , which was chosen to have a similar @xmath121 to the mixture studied by horowitz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , had 2% oxygen by mass at the top of the ocean , so that @xmath122 .",
    "the steady - state composition at the base of the ocean was 37% oxygen , giving @xmath123 .",
    "se mixture had @xmath124 at the top of the ocean and @xmath125 at the base , giving @xmath126 .",
    "interestingly , some compositions that we study in this paper have @xmath127 , so that chemical separation would not lead to convection in those cases .",
    "also we note that the lightest mixtures with @xmath128 have smaller values of @xmath88 by about a factor of ten compared to the heavier mixtures .",
    "therefore , light element oceans should have much less convective driving .",
    "our results rely on an extension of the analytic fits made by @xcite to monte carlo simulations of three - component plasmas to multicomponent plasmas . even for the three - component case",
    ", @xcite found systematically lower melting temperatures ( higher @xmath57 ) in their md simulations compared to the semi - analytic model .",
    "they noted that this discrepancy seemed to grow with impurity parameter @xmath0 , perhaps suggesting a problem with the form of the deviation from linear mixing @xmath45 [ equation  ( [ eq : delta_fs ] ) ] assumed in the semi - analytic model .",
    "figure [ fig : std ] shows that @xmath83 increases with @xmath0 at fixed @xmath31 , which may explain the trend with @xmath0 seen by @xcite , since @xmath45 becomes more and more important at larger values of @xmath57 .",
    "it is important to carry out further comparisons with molecular dynamics simulations @xcite to check and refine these assumptions about the functional form of the free energy as well as to investigate the formation of multiple solid phases .",
