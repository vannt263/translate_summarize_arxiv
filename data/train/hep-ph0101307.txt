    "the evidence of the neutrino masses and its mixing angles from the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments @xcite indicates a method to solve a challenging question in cosmology and particle physics : namely , baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this asymmetry can not be explained with the `` pure '' standard model ( sm )  with negligible @xmath3 asymmetry  to the phenomenologically right magnitude of baryogenesis .",
    "in fact , the electroweak phase transition scenario for baryogenesis does not work very well in the frame of the sm with presently known lower bound of the sm higgs mass @xcite . even for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "this scenario is strongly disfavoured by baryon number wash - out at the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "more detailed analyses of the mssm @xcite have been made and it is claimed that the mssm is just consistent with baryogenesis in a very restricted region of parameter space requiring the right - handed stop to be lighter than the top quark and the left - handed stop heavier than 1  @xmath4 .",
    "the model which we investigate in the present article  the extended anti - gut model  has as one of its characteristics that it coincides with the pure sm ( at least ) for energy scales below the see - saw neutrino scale , and so we have in this model no way to get the phenomenological baryon number unless we already have an @xmath3 asymmetry prior to the weak epoch .",
    "however in the sm the neutrinos are massless due to the weak gauge symmetry or the conservation of the lepton number @xmath5 and therefore the observed neutrino masses imply the existence of the new scale  the only well - known scales ,  weak , strong and planck scales , alone are not able to provided this scale .",
    "a very suggestive mechanism is the the see - saw mechanism @xcite .    in our extended anti - gut @xcite model",
    "the see - saw mechanism is already built in as far as we assume the existence of the three right - handed neutrinos ",
    "majorana neutrinos  in the range of a new scale in the order of @xmath6 , and the predictions of this model are very successful for the small mixing angle msw @xcite ( sma - msw ) scenario .",
    "sakharov @xcite has pointed out that a matter - anti - matter asymmetry can be dynamically generated in an expanding universe if the particle interactions and the cosmological evolution satisfy the three conditions : _ ( 1 ) _ baryon number violation , _ ( 2 ) _",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath7 violation , _ ( 3 ) _ departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the anti - gut model is a natural extension model of the sm in which @xmath0 and @xmath7 are already violated ,  this model satisfies if combined with the standard cosmology all these sakharov s conditions , therefore the baryon number asymmetry should be predictable with this model in the scenario that the three majorana neutrinos are very heavy and that they violate the lepton number conservation during their out - of - equilibrium decays in the early stage of the universe : baryogenesis via lepton number violation @xcite .",
    "the presently `` observed '' baryon asymmetry , the baryon density - to - entropy density ratio of the universe , @xmath8is with the universe evolution explained as consequence of the spectrum and interactions of the particles which break the linear combination of the baryon number ( @xmath9 ) and lepton number , @xmath3 , global symmetry at high temperature .    in the following section",
    ", we should review briefly the anti - gut model to calculate the baryogenesis .",
    "then , in the next section , we shall discuss the scenario of the baryogenesis via lepton number violation . in section",
    "@xmath10 we present the results of our model .",
    "section @xmath11 contains our conclusion and resum .",
    "[ table1 ]    .all @xmath12 quantum charges in extended anti - gut model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section we shall review briefly the extended anti - gut model @xcite .",
    "the extended anti - gut model is based on a large gauge group which is the cartesian product of family specific gauge groups , namely , @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes @xmath15 ( sm gauge group ) , and @xmath16 denotes the generation ,  each `` proto - family '' has a certain subgroup of the grand unification group , @xmath17 .",
    "this group in eq .",
    "( [ eq : agutgauge ] ) consist of those representations that do not mix the different irreducible representation of the sm and is spontaneously breaking down to the @xmath18 at the scale about @xmath19 to @xmath20 orders of magnitude under the planck scale .",
    "the breaking is supposed to occur by six higgs fields which we have invented and denoted by the symbols @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and their quantum numbers are given in table @xmath19 .",
    "finally the breaking of @xmath27 of the sm is broken by weinberg - salam higgs field , @xmath28 .",
    "( also its quantum numbers are found in table @xmath19 . )",
    "we summarise here the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the seven higgs fields which the model contains :    _ ) _    the smallest vev higgs field is the standard model weinberg - salam higgs field , @xmath29 , with the vev at the weak scale being @xmath30 .",
    "the next smallest vev higgs field is also alone in its class and breaks the common @xmath3 gauge group @xmath31 , common to the all the families .",
    "this symmetry is supposed to be broken ( higgsed ) at the see - saw scale as needed for fitting the over all neutrino oscillation scale .",
    "this vev is of the order of @xmath6 and called @xmath32 .",
    "the next @xmath10 higgs fields are called @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 and have vevs of the order of a factor @xmath33 to @xmath34 under the planck unit .",
    "that means that if intermediate propagators have scales given by the planck scale , as we assume , they will give rise to suppression factors of the order @xmath35 each time they are needed to cause a transition .",
    "the last one , with vev of the same order of the planck scale , is the higgs field @xmath21 , which gives little suppression when it is applied , of the order of a factor @xmath36 .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath37 well - known weyl particles and additional three particles - majorana neutrinos - are gotten from the requirement that all anomalies evolving @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 vanish strongly even without using green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism @xcite ,  the extended anti - gut model is an anomaly free model .",
    "these quantum numbers are also shown in table @xmath19 .",
    "now we can write down the mass matrices which are necessary to discuss the mechanism of baryogenesis in the following sections : the dirac neutrino mass matrix and the majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "these matrix elements were gotten using the technical corrections , factorial factor corrections , @xmath41 multiplying the mass matrix elements which take into account the possibilities of permuting the contributing higgs fields . with this technical correction and the quantum charges of the higgs fields",
    "the mass matrices , dirac neutrino and the majorana neutrino , are given by : @xmath42    we know neither the yukawa couplings nor the precise masses of the fundamental fermions , but it is a basic assumption of the naturalness of our model that these couplings are of order unity and random complex in the planck scale . in the numerical evaluation of the consequences of the model we explicitly take into account these uncertain factors of order unity by providing each matrix element with an explicit random number @xmath43 - with a distribution so that its average @xmath44 and its spreading is @xmath45 .",
    "note that the random complex order of unity factors which are supposed to multiply all the mass matrix elements are not presented here .",
    "the weak @xmath46 instantons @xcite - sphaleron @xcite - guaranteed the rapid exchanges of the baryon number and lepton number in which though @xmath3 is conserved in the time of big bang , when the temperature was above the weak scale . but in our model we have the three right - handed neutrinos decaying in the @xmath47 quantum number violating way , in fact also @xmath3 violating way , at the time scale of the see - saw neutrinos",
    ". therefore the baryon number violation condition of the first sakharov s condition was effectively fulfilled .",
    "the assumption in our model that all the coupling constants and coefficients are of _ order of unity _ and _ random _ at the planck scale , especially having random phases as far as allowed , implies not only @xmath0 violation but also @xmath7 violation .    finally the third condition among the sakharov conditions  out - of - equilibrium  comes about during the hubble expansion due to the excess of the three type of the right - handed majorana neutrinos caused by their masses . from these statements our model",
    "is seen to implement the scenario of fukugita and yanagida @xcite .    in the scenario favoured by our model",
    "the one among the three right - handed neutrinos turns out to gives the dominant contribution to the baryon or rather @xmath48 quantum produced with the second becoming almost same order magnitude .",
    "also it turns out that the average lifetime of this heaviest right - handed neutrino is of the same order as the hubble expansion time so that we can count that a major part of these right - handed neutrinos first decay after inverse decays have essentially stopped .",
    "we shall justify and discuss these features of the scenario induced by our model in the next subsection .",
    "but first we shall describe the appearance of the baryon asymmetry taking for granted the mentioned assumptions so that we _ ( 1 ) _ use only the heaviest right - handed neutrino and _ ( 2 ) _ assume it to live relatively long compared to the time needed before @xmath3 is effectively conserved again . really as we shall discuss",
    "more below , it is not the full @xmath3 which is the important quantity but a special roughly speaking `` third generation @xmath3 '' that is the sufficiently well conserved charge quantity .      _ a priori _ the excess of @xmath48 quantum number risk to be diluted or washed out before the `` accidental '' @xmath48 conservation of the sm sets in .",
    "it is therefore very important to argue for that such wash out does not take place .",
    "an important point is that it actually will turn out that if we only thought in terms of @xmath48 one would estimate an appreciable wash out .",
    "however , _ we define a new `` new charge '' @xmath49 which _ is not exactly the same as the @xmath50 in our model , the latter a proto @xmath50 while @xmath49 deviates by mixing angles from the first one . ] _ is washed away much more slowly .",
    "_ in the era until the lightest right - handed neutrino has become so hard to produce that there are basically no more inverse decay processes producing it going on and also @xmath20-by-@xmath20 scatterings are supposed negligible , we have effective conservation of the following charge @xmath49 : we define @xmath49 to the baryon number minus the lepton number sitting on those leptons ( or quarks ) which are capable by collision with a weinberg - salam higgs particle to produce , in resonance say , the heaviest of the right - handed neutrino , but not the two lighter ones .    it the era when we can ignore diagrams involving the heaviest see - saw neutrino a `` third generation '' quark or lepton ,  not coupling to the vertices @xmath51 or @xmath52 can not get converted in a @xmath48-violating way because the diagrams have to contain such vertices .",
    "the protection against dilution by @xmath53 and @xmath54 effects of the by @xmath55 produced @xmath48 hoped for is thus not relying on our model having a gauged @xmath50 but is a more general mechanism .",
    "the question of whether the @xmath48 quantum number produced in excess by the decays of the heaviest majorana neutrino will be preserved for the future is thus the question of whether the temperature falls so deep that this right - handed heaviest neutrino itself gets so hard to produce that we can ignore its inverse decay before all these heaviest right - handed neutrinos have decayed except for a fraction of order unity .",
    "the time needed to make the heaviest right - handed neutrino effectively unproduceable is the hubble time corresponding to the temperature being equal to the mass of this see - saw neutrino .",
    "the crucial parameter to settle if this approximation of sufficiently slow decay is thus the ratio @xmath56where @xmath57 is the width of the flavour @xmath16 majorana neutrino , @xmath58 is its mass and @xmath59 is the number of the degree of freedom at temperature @xmath58 ( see eq .",
    "@xmath60 ) .",
    "now a right - handed neutrino , @xmath61 , decay into a weinberg - salam higgs particle and a left - handed lepton or into the @xmath7 conjugate channel .",
    "these two channels have different lepton numbers @xmath62 .",
    "but , because of our random couplings , the partial widths do not have to be the same to next - to - leading - order perturbation theory . defining the measure @xmath63 for the @xmath7 violation in the decay of the right - handed neutrino @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the @xmath67 decay rates ( in the @xmath67 rest frame ) , summed over the neutral and charged leptons ( and weinberg - salam higgs fields ) which appear as final states in the @xmath67 decays one sees that the excess of leptons over anti - leptons produced in the decay of one @xmath67 is just @xmath63 .    at high temperature ( @xmath68 )",
    "equilibrium there were as many majorana neutrinos per species as massless fermions , sm fermions . in the case ( @xmath68 ) all these majorana neutrinos decay after the @xmath3 violation is switched off .",
    "to be able to calculate baryogenesis we need to obtain the total number of effectively massless degree of freedom of the plasma , @xmath59 , at temperature of the order of lightest right - handed neutrino ( about @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 , there are @xmath71 bosons and @xmath37 well - known weyl fermions plus @xmath16 majorana particles : @xmath72 here @xmath73 denotes the effective temperature of any species @xmath74 . when we have coupling as at the stage discussed between all the particles @xmath75 .",
    "the entropy of planck radiation with the degree of freedom @xmath59 is @xmath76 moreover , we should note here that due to the electroweak sphaleron effect , the baryon number asymmetry @xmath77 is related to the lepton number asymmetry @xmath78 by @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of generations and @xmath81 the number of higgs doublets , this reads in the sm @xmath82 .",
    "because @xmath83 is not small , we have to expect a dilution effect for which we define the suppression factor @xmath84 ,  we define @xmath84 so that the resulting relative to entropy density , @xmath85 , baryon number density @xmath86 a good approximation for @xmath84 , the dilution factor , is inferred from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath87    note that these dilution factors  we are taking it  contain the effect of the sphaleron processes we should use , instead of the eq . @xmath88 and eq .",
    "@xmath89 , we took the following interpolating redefined dilution factor in the range @xmath90 : @xmath91    since this dilution factor is smoother than the in the ref .",
    "@xcite defined one , and due to using order - of - one complex random factors in calculation of @xmath83 s , especially in our model , baryogenesis comes mainly from the third majorana neutrino decay ,  the calculation of the @xmath92 have to be carefully performed because of @xmath93 , therefore we should better use the newly defined smoothed out @xmath84 in eq .",
    "@xmath94 .      the total decay rate at the tree level ( fig .",
    "@xmath95 ) is given by @xmath96    fmffig    the @xmath1 violation in the majorana neutrino decays , @xmath63 , arises when the effects of loop are taken into account , and at the one - loop , the only @xmath1 asymmetry of the vertex contribution comes from the diagram shown in fig .",
    "however there is an other contribution , from the wave function renormalisation ( fig .",
    "@xmath98 ) , which must be also taken into account and which gives typically same order amount as the vertex one @xcite : @xmath99 \\left[\\ , f \\left ( \\frac{m_j^2}{m_i^2 } \\right ) + g \\left ( \\frac{m_j^2}{m_i^2 } \\right)\\,\\right]\\ ] ] where the function , @xmath100 , comes from the one - loop vertex contribution and the other function , @xmath101 , comes from the self - energy contribution .",
    "these functions can be calculated in perturbation theory only for differences between majorana neutrino masses which are sufficiently large compare to its decay widths ,   the mass splittings satisfy the condition , @xmath102 : @xmath103\\nn , \\label{eq : vas1}\\\\ g(x ) & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{1-x } \\label{eq : vas2}\\nn.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we present the calculation of the baryogenesis at first numerically , and then in a crude way by seeking the dominating terms .",
    "the calculation goes by using formula @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 taking as the mass matrix @xmath107 , the expression @xmath108 , with each matrix element further provided with an ( independent of the other matrix elements ) random number of order unity .",
    "also the right - handed neutrino masses to be used as @xmath109 in the functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 in formulas @xmath105 and @xmath106 are ( in principle ) calculated by inserting random numbers of order unity into , in this case , the right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath112 , in the way that each matrix element is again provided with an order of unity random ( complex ) factor .",
    "these random order unity coefficients are in the calculation taken as complex pseudo - random numbers .    the quantity @xmath63 is then calculated @xmath113 times and its logarithm , @xmath114 , is averaged over the different sets of random numbers . and the parameters which are the suppression factors @xmath115 and @xmath26 are taken for the best cases of our previous article fitting the neutrino masses and its mixing angles : @xmath116 where the vacuum expectation values , except the weinberg - salam higgs and @xmath117 , are presented in the planck unit .",
    "that is to say we really use @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 from one of the best fits including the factorial corrections to the charged lepton and quarks , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are fitted to the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "since our model unavoidable predicts the small mixing angle msw solution , our calculation is not meaningful unless the sma solution is right .",
    "but recently barbieri and strumia @xcite have studied the neutrino oscillation fit using `` non - standard analogies '' method and have shown that the region of the sma - msw solution should be shifted in the direction of smaller mixing angle , so that it escapes the day - night effect exclusion by the super - kamiokande measurements .",
    "our total baryogenesis is a sum of three contributions , one from each see - saw particle .",
    "the total baryon density - to - entropy density ratio is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the contribution due to the decay see - saw neutrino number @xmath16 counted upwards in mass .",
    "dominantly the signs of @xmath120 and @xmath121 are strongly correlated but since the @xmath120-contribution is diluted away it does not matter and the danger of cancellation is not there .",
    "actually we included in the numerical calculation the correlation of signs effects correctly . in our case",
    "the contribution of @xmath122 is dominant and the other contributions are negligible compared to @xmath122 .",
    "this makes the scheme opposite to susy constraint ones .",
    "the numerical results of our best fitting case gives @xmath123 using the philosophy of letting order unity random numbers being given by a gaussian distribution presented in the article @xcite we estimate the uncertainty in the natural exponent for @xmath77 to be @xmath124 @xmath125 . with these error estimations",
    "we get @xmath126",
    "@xmath127    [ massenmitff ]    we have obtained with the cosmological fit , @xmath128 excellently agreeing prediction of the baryon number - to - entropy ratio @xmath129 from our extended anti - gut under use of parameters all already fit to either the charged lepton and quark spectra or to the neutrino oscillations .",
    "even the `` discrete fitting '' of the precise choice of discrete quantum numbers of the seven higgs fields @xmath28 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 of our model were fit already to the mass and mixing angle data .    it should be remarked that our model predicts all fermion masses ( neutrino mass square difference ratio ) and their mixing angles , including jarlskog triangle , using above presented seven higgs vevs ( the quarks and charged lepton mass spectra and their mixing angles are presented in table  @xmath20 . ) : @xmath130  our predictions are compatible with the solar neutrino solution . because of smallness of the cabibbo angle induces our solar mixing angle to be so small that it would stress the model drastically to seek to fit one of the series of large solar mixing angle fitting regions .",
    "all of the input parameters are , seven higgs vevs , already determined before the calculation of baryogenesis , so in this sense the baryon number - to - entropy ratio is pure prediction from our model !    the number of measured quantities which are predictable with our model , quark and charged lepton masses and its mixing angles including the jarlskog triangle area @xmath131 and also two mass square differences for the neutrino and the three of their mixing angles , is @xmath132 .",
    "our model successfully predicted all these quantities using only six parameters : the genuine number of predicted parameters is thus @xmath133 .",
    "but we have taken into the predictions the quantity @xmath134 for which chooz has only an upper bound .",
    "it should , however , be admitted that our prediction is _ only order of magnitude - wise _ because we needed to use the assumption that all the coupling constants at the fundamental scale are of order unity .      in the crudest approximation",
    "our agreement means that the general success of getting good baryon number prediction from the fukugita - yanagida scheme of having @xmath9 asymmetry from the see - saw scale works well with our specific model .",
    "this very good agreement of our prediction , of course , suggests that our specific model may carry some truth .",
    "it is first of all via the @xmath7-violating parameter , @xmath135 , that different detailed models can make their differences felt since even a supersymmetric model doubling of @xmath136 is only a factor @xmath20 hardly distinguishable with our only order of unity accuracy .",
    "we expect the @xmath135 which is an expression for the overall size of the yukawa couplings  it is a loop effect relative to the tree diagram  for given mass splitting  for charged leptons and quarks to be sensitive to the number of effective charges in the model used for the mass protections .",
    "indeed we expect more general suppression and therefore smaller @xmath135 and thus baryon number if we imagined to have control over the @xmath84 s  the bigger the number of charge types used .    when our model then gives a good baryon number result we should expect that its number of charges species ",
    "effectively  used is roughly right . since our model has in fact under some restrictions the maximal number of gauge charges the success of predicting @xmath135 suggests that the right model should have a rather large number of charges species .",
    "it should , however , in this connection be reminded that since we have the field @xmath21 giving only a tiny suppression the tree group we have `` effectively '' used is not the full anti - gut one but rather the subgroup of it obtained after breaking by @xmath21 , @xmath137 .    it should be also be mentioned that it was in our anti - gut put in , that the representations of the non - abelian subgroups @xmath138 and @xmath46 were given by a rule and @xmath139 gauge groups are obtained as the same ones as a quark or lepton in the sm has when its weak hypercharge @xmath140 equals @xmath141 . ] from those of the abelian , so that the non - abelian ones play no separate role .",
    "we did not even list the non - abelian representations in table @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , it should be stressed that our scenario is very different from the susy model one : in susy model or sugra there is the problem that gravitinos survive and cause an unacceptable mass density contribution unless their production does not occur due to late inflation @xcite .",
    "this makes it a problem to obtain the @xmath3 from the see - saw neutrino decays and more problematic the heavier the right - handed neutrino used .",
    "this is why buchmller and plmacher @xcite have the lightest of the right - handed neutrino provide the baryogenesis .",
    "since our model is a non - susy one we have no gravitino problem and thus we could equally well make use the heavier majorana neutrinos as of only the light one .",
