    "understanding the effects of decoherence on evolution of a quantum system is an important aspect of various investigations in quantum information theory  @xcite . quantum correlation , in particular quantum entanglement  @xcite , is extremely fragile to environmental perturbations and exhibits rapid decay against surrounding noises , often leading to the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death ( esd )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for practical implementation of different quantum information theoretic protocols such as superdense coding  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , and quantum key distribution  @xcite , using composite quantum systems  @xcite , one of the primary motivations is to examine and counteract the adverse effects of environmental noise in quantum system .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a generalized double jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model  @xcite , consisting of two cavities , each of which contains a single two - level atom inside .",
    "our main aim is to study the dynamics of entanglement between the isolated atoms , under the constraint that energy transfer between the cavities is permissible through a controlled photon - hopping mechanism @xcite .",
    "the model is significant from a quantum information theoretic perspective as the nonclassical correlations generated due to the interaction between the atoms and the modes of the cavities can be harnessed for performing different quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks  @xcite .",
    "the jc model , consisting of a single atom - photon interaction , was first introduced to study spontaneous emission and examine the semiclassical behavior associated with quantum radiation  @xcite . in the following years , in order to gain a deeper insight of the underlying phenomenon associated with atom - photon interactions , various generalizations of the jc model have been proposed , even in the multiparty domain  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the case of the double jc model , consisting of two atoms , each inside a pair of lossless cavities  @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the time - evolving atom - cavity systems , which do not mutually interact , follow an unusual dynamics of entanglement between the atoms , leading to esd . moreover , since the pair of atom - cavity systems form a closed system , the entanglement revives after sudden death in a periodic manner .",
    "interestingly , the time period over which the bipartite entanglement remains zero , after esd and before revival , turns out to be an explicit function of the entanglement of the initial two - atom state .",
    "however , this correspondence between the initial entanglement and the duration of death is not valid if only a single cavity is present  @xcite , and though the system still undergoes esd , the hierarchy of initial states , based on their entanglement , is lost .",
    "moreover , it has also been reported that instead of considering the cavities in their respective ground states , if one starts with two different initial light fields , say the squeezed vacuum state and the coherent state , then the double intensity - dependent jc model  @xcite , would generate a periodic entanglement pulse which may be useful for qip protocols .",
    "further generalization in this direction incorporates the influences of atom - field coupling and dipole - dipole coupling , on the entanglement between the isolated atoms , kept in their respective cavities  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that at large atom - field coupling , the collapse and revival of entanglement only appear at large dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "therefore , it is evident from the above examples that in the double jc model , the effects of cavity - induced environmental perturbations on the dynamics of entanglement leads to an unavoidable sudden death , thus making the bipartite atomic state inefficient for performing various qip tasks . hence , there is a major motivation to design atom - cavity models that can potentially avoid entanglement loss in an efficient manner . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was reported that by choosing different decay coefficients of the atoms from the upper to any other low energy level , the phenomenon of esd can be mitigated .",
    "further proposals in the direction involve sophisticated schemes based on zeno - like measurements during the dynamical process  @xcite , resulting in not only the prevention of esd but also the enhancement of entanglement .    in our work ,",
    "we attempt to overcome the sudden death of entanglement in a double jc model , by modelling a photon exchange mechanism between the two cavities , thus introducing a cavity - cavity interaction in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that such photon - hopping between cavities is routinely used in the simulation of strongly correlated dynamics on a mesoscopic scale , using arrays of atom - cavity systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , these models can potentially be realized in experiments using , among others , photonic band gap structure of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamonds , placed in a cavity @xcite or microwave strip line resonators @xcite .",
    "based on analytical results , we report that for low values of the cavity - cavity interaction , entanglement between the isolated atoms , as quantified by concurrence  @xcite , evolves in almost a similar fashion as compared to the case when no interaction is present  @xcite .",
    "however , a significantly different behavior can be observed when the cavity - cavity interaction term is moderately increased .",
    "we observe that for these values , a complete prevention of entanglement loss through esd can be achieved , irrespective of the entanglement content of the initial state .",
    "moreover , the entanglement between the two cavities remains negligibly small , which is contrary to the behavior obtained when photon exchange between the cavities is forbidden .",
    "the result can be interpreted in the following way . in the absence of cavity - cavity interaction , or for values",
    "much lower than the atom - cavity interaction , the initial atom - atom entanglement undergoes an approximate quantum transfer to the cavity - cavity system via the two atom - cavity quantum channels , leading to esd in the atom - atom system .",
    "the opposite process leads to revival of entanglement in the atom - atom system .",
    "however , in the presence of a stronger cavity - cavity interaction , there is a considerable amount of entanglement in the cavity - cavity system . in effect , the complete quantum transfer from the atom - atom system to the other pair is significantly inhibited , in comparison to the opposite process , which leads to avoidance of esd .",
    "hence , the results show that one can model a double jc system that protects the entanglement between two central atoms in the system against cavity induced decay . upon introducing an external cavity - cavity interaction",
    "we achieve a complete preclusion of the esd phenomenon through the course of evolution . to highlight the importance of our results , we compare the effect of cavity - cavity interaction with the more intrusive case where the atoms directly interact through ising or @xmath0 spin - exchange interactions  @xcite .",
    "we observe that for the ising interaction , a strong spin - spin coupling is required to overcome esd , whereas , for the @xmath0 interaction , circumventing sudden death is not possible for certain parameter ranges even for high coupling .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a double jaynes - cummings model , consisting of two lossless cavities , each of which contains a two - level atom ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) .",
    "each of the cavities has a single harmonic oscillator mode and can be represented in the fock basis .",
    "the physical model described above can mathematically be expressed in the following way @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the transition frequency between the atomic levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator mode of the cavity , and @xmath6 is the atom - cavity coupling constant , also known as the single - photon rabi frequency .",

    "@xmath11 is the atomic inversion operator given by the pauli spin operator along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "here , for all computation purpose we kept @xmath13 and @xmath14 . at this point , the atoms can only interact with their respective cavities and energy flow between the cavities is not permissible , thus creating a pair of isolated atom - cavity systems .",
    "the above hamiltonian is an exemplary model often employed as a basic template to study atom - cavity interactions and the effects of environmental perturbation on system dynamics .",
    "moreover , in recent years , practical realization of the double jc model in cavity - qed experiments  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , and photonic lattices  @xcite have also been reported , which significantly raises the potential for application in qip protocols . in the next section , for completeness , we will briefly review the dynamics of certain initially entangled states , under the time evolution generated by @xmath15 , and in the absence of any interaction between the isolated pair of atom - cavity systems .",
    "subsequently , in the later parts of the work , we will present the effects of additional interaction terms between the isolated cavities in the above hamiltonian .",
    "we begin with a review of the time dynamics of an isolated double jc model , where the two non - interacting atoms share an initial state that evolves under the effects of the perturbation induced by the non - interacting cavities  @xcite .",
    "we start with the scenario where the atoms in each of the cavities are spatially separated , but initially entangled on account of some interaction in the past . in this regard ,",
    "an important aspect is to note that the initial entangled state between the two atoms and the cavities is quenched by the double jc model , leading to decay of the entanglement .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior of entanglement dynamics is sensitive to the chosen initially entangled state , and depending on its form , the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement may differ significantly  @xcite .",
    "below we briefly review two different forms of the initially entangled two - atom states and study their entanglement dynamics .      in the single excitation scenario , we start with the following initial state for the two atoms in the cavity : @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) represent the atomic excited state ( ground state ) .",
    "moreover , we consider both the cavities are isolated and initially in their respective ground states .",
    "therefore , the entire atom - cavity system can now be expressed as @xmath19 are the basis states in the fock space , characterizing each of the cavities .",
    "now at @xmath20 , starting with the initially entangled state @xmath21 the time evolution is governed by @xmath15 . after time @xmath22 , the initial state evolves to the following final state given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 s are the time evolved state amplitudes and are the functions of the system parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 . from the time - evolved state , @xmath27 , one can quantify the entanglement between the two atoms using the reduced density matrix @xmath28 , where @xmath29 = @xmath30 $ ] and the trace is done over the cavity states .",
    "we compute the entanglement using concurrence  @xcite ( @xmath31 ) , defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 s are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath34 and @xmath35 . here",

    "we consider @xmath42 , and scaled time , @xmath43 . ]",
    "[ sudden_death ] shows the variation of the bipartite entanglement @xmath31 with the scaled time , @xmath43 , for @xmath42 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that for the case of single excitation , the initially entangled state , @xmath21 , evolves such that entanglement sinusoidally collapses and revives in time , with an amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "a significant change in the decay pattern is observed if one considers the following initial atomic state : @xmath45 by doing some algebra , the final time - evolved state is given by , @xmath46 for the zero detuning case ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , one obtains the following expression for the concurrence : @xmath48 the variation of @xmath31 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ sudden_death ] , once again , for @xmath42 .",
    "surprisingly , in this case the behavior of @xmath31 is significantly different than that obtained using the initial state in eq .",
    "( [ ini_1 ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ sudden_death ] , one can see that during the evolution , entanglement abruptly falls to zero , and remains so , for a certain period of time before the revival occurs .",
    "the phenomenon of abrupt decay and subsequent disappearance of entanglement  @xcite is termed as sudden death of entanglement .",
    "it is worth mentioning some of the important aspects of the entanglement dynamics observed in the double jc system .",
    "though there is no exchange of energy between the isolated pair of atom - cavity systems , the entanglement between the pair of atoms is transferred to the pair of cavities and vice - versa during the evolution .",
    "for instance , when the atom - atom entanglement vanishes , the cavity - cavity entanglement is high .",
    "moreover , for initial states with arbitrary entanglement , the time duration between sudden death and revival is inversely proportional to the initial entanglement  @xcite .",
    "however , there also appears to be no distinct similarity between equally entangled initial states .",
    "both the initial states considered in this case ( single and double excitation ) are maximally entangled , and are locally connected i.e. are local - operation - classical - communication equivalent bell states @xcite , however , their entanglement dynamics significantly differs from each other .",
    "hence , the information concealed in the local density matrices of the initially entangled states , are indeed inadequate to trace the evolution of the system .",
    "therefore , from the above discussions it is clear that depending on the initial state considered , the environmental perturbation has significant effects on the entanglement shared between the atoms in the cavity . in the next sections we will see how the scenario changes",
    "if we introduce additional interaction terms in the double jc model .",
    "in the previous section , we observe that the dynamics of the entanglement between the atoms , governed by the double jc model , is sensitive to cavity induced perturbations and for certain initial states may face sudden death .",
    "this indeed makes the quantum channel , shared by the atoms , inefficient for performing several qip tasks .",
    "therefore , at this stage , one may ask the following question : `` is there a non - intrusive way to minimize the cavity effects such that esd can be avoided ? '' a plausible strategy is to consider a photon - exchange mechanism between the cavities , without directly affecting the atoms in the system .",
    "the energy transfer between the cavities may allow sufficient re - coherence between the isolated atoms to bypass sudden death and make the two - atom system more robust against environmental perturbations induced by the cavities .",
    "importantly such interactions between cavities have been envisaged in the study of strongly correlated arrays of optical cavities @xcite , by introducing photon - hopping between cavities , to simulate bose - hubbard models . from our context , we first modify the hamiltonian expressed in eq .",
    "( [ jc_main ] ) by including a cavity - cavity interaction term , in the following way : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cavity - cavity coupling term .",
    "all the other terms are as defined for eq .",
    "( [ jc_main ] ) .",
    "an important simplification in investigating the dynamics of the double jc model , is to make use of the symmetry . since",
    ", the pair of atom - cavity systems form a closed systems , the total energy in the system is a conserved quantity . hence , for a maximum of double excitation in the atomic state , the hamiltonian of the system can be expressed using the following basis states for the total atom - cavity system : @xmath51}. the hamiltonian in the reduced basis is given by    @xmath52    therefore , we restrict all the computations in the reduced hilbert space , spanned by the above basis states .",
    "the above hamiltonian is easy to handle and can be exactly diagonalized , which yields following spectrum of eigenvalues given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 s are given by @xmath55    at this point , we consider the state expressed in eq .",
    "( [ ini_2 ] ) as the initial state , @xmath21 .",
    "now due to the action of the time - evolution operator generated by @xmath56 , the initially entangled state @xmath21 evolves to the final state @xmath57 , which can be expressed using the reduced basis mentioned above , in the following way @xmath58 where @xmath24 s are the function of the system parameters @xmath59 .",
    "however , at this stage one should note that due to the inclusion of the cavity - cavity interaction , the exact analytical form of the coefficients @xmath24 s can not be expressed in simple mathematical terms .",
    "one of the primary reason behind this complexity is that evolution of the system now covers a larger hilbert space due to permitted photon - exchange between the cavities , as compared to the @xmath60 scenario .",
    "below we present the analytical form of the @xmath24 s :    @xmath61    now in order to obtain the reduced state @xmath28 , characterizing the density matrix of the two - atoms , one needs to trace out the degrees of freedom associated with two cavities from the time - evolved state , @xmath57 .",

    "however , as the coupling strength is moderately increased ( @xmath111 ) , a more robust response of bipartite entanglement can be observed , which results in complete preclusion of the esd phenomenon during the atom - cavity evolution .",
    "we also verify if the effect of a more direct interaction between the atoms can mitigate the decoherence effects induced by the cavity . by setting cavity interactions in the weak regime and including spin - exchange interaction , pertaining to the ising and @xmath0 class of hamiltonians , we observe that the effects are not very encouraging .",
    "for the ising interaction , complete evasion of esd is only achieved at very high values of interaction , whereas , for the @xmath0 class , no clear parameter regime exists that can overcome esd for all arbitrary initial states of the system .",
    "this shows that the cavity - mediated interaction is a more robust approach to countering the decoherence of entanglement in the archetypal double jc model . with the existence of experimental apparatus to implement photon - exchange between cavities , such as in photonic band gap structures in nv centers of diamonds @xcite and microwave strip line resonators @xcite , along with developments in rydberg atoms in superconducting cavities @xcite , the results presented could provide an important direction in overcoming loss of coherence in quantum protocols .",

    "<S> we consider a generalized double jaynes - cummings model consisting of two isolated two - level atoms , each contained in a lossless cavity , with the cavities interacting with each other through a controlled photon hopping mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal dynamics of entanglement between the two atoms , as the atom - cavity system evolves with time , is investigated for different values of the mediated cavity - cavity interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically show that at low values of such an interaction , entanglement between the atoms evolves under the effects of cavity perturbation and exhibits the well - known phenomenon of entanglement sudden death . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , using moderately large values of the interaction , a complete preclusion of sudden death of entanglement can be achieved , irrespective of its value in the initial two - atom state . </S>",
    "<S> our results , thus allow us to design a model to sustain bipartite entanglement between two atomic qubits under the adverse effect of cavity induced environmental perturbation , by introducing a non - intrusive inter - cavity photon exchange that can be physically realized through cavity - qed setups in contemporary experiments . for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the effects of inter - cavity interaction on entanglement with the case of direct spin - exchange interaction between the two isolated atoms . </S>"
