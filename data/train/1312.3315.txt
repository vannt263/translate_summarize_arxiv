    "decays are ubiquitous in physics : examples are tunnelling processes in quantum mechanics , very slow decays of nuclei ( such as double-@xmath0 decays , lifetime of about @xmath1 y ) , as well as very fast decays of hadrons and the higgs particle ( lifetime of about @xmath2 sec ) .",
    "although the involved decay times are astonishingly different , the basic phenomenon is the same : a irreversible transition ( infinite poincare time ) of an unstable initial state coupled to a continuum of final states .",
    "both in the context of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and quantum  field theory ( qft ) , an unstable state @xmath3 is not an eingenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath4 of the system , but is described by the so - called energy distribution @xmath5 : @xmath6 is the probability that the unstable state @xmath3 has an energy between @xmath7 and @xmath8 the survival probability amplitude @xmath9 that the state @xmath10 , prepared at the initial time @xmath11 , has not yet decayed at the instant @xmath12 , is given by@xmath13 the survival probability is given , as usual , by the amplitude squared : @xmath14 the exponential decay @xmath15 is obtained when @xmath5 takes the breit - wigner ( bw ) form : @xmath16   ^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this is however an unphysical limiting case , because a physical distribution @xmath5 should fulfill the following two requirements : ( i ) existence of an energy threshold , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , which suffices to prove that long - time deviations exist , usually implying a power - law of the type @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "( ii ) finiteness of the mean energy , @xmath20 , which implies that @xmath21 and therefore that deviations at short times occur @xcite .",
    "moreover , a non - exponential behavior at short times implies the existence of the quantum zeno effect , which is the inhibition of the decay ( or , more in general , of a quantum transition ) , due to reiterated frequent measurements @xcite . from an experimental standpoint , the quantum zeno effect was observed by inhibition of a rabi oscillation between atomic energy levels @xcite . an improved set - up , in which the zeno effect was verified by using single ions and by means of interaction - free repeated measurements ,",
    "was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for what concerns the decay law of a ` genuine ' unstable quantum state ,",
    "the first experimental demonstration of short - time deviations from the exponential law has been observed by studying the tunneling of cold atoms in an optical potential @xcite .",
    "later on , the same group @xcite could verify also the zeno ( as well as the anti - zeno ) effect by applying a series of intermediate measurements on this system .",
    "finally , the experimental proof of long - time deviations from the exponential law has been observed by investigating the decay via fluorescence of organic molecules @xcite .",
    "an experiment performed in the gsi has also found deviations from the exponential decay law in hydrogen - like ions decaying via electron capture @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite these deviations have been linked to a modification of the bw distribution due to interactions with the measuring apparatus .",
    "other explanations , based on neutrino oscillations or energy level splitting of the initial state , have also been put forward @xcite .    in this proceeding",
    "we review some aspects of the non - exponential decay at short times both in qm and in qft . in sec .",
    "2 we present for the qm case a simple but general hamiltonian to elucidate the main points . then",
    ", we describe two recent developments in qm : the broadening of the emitted spectrum at short times @xcite and the case of a decay into two decay channels @xcite . in sec .",
    "3 we turn to the qft case and we describe the recent results of refs .",
    "@xcite , in which it has been shown that , contrary to previous claims @xcite , deviations from the exponential decay law also take place in a genuine qft framework . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we present our conclusions .",
    "we introduce a general approach to study decays in qm , which is based on the so - called lee hamiltonian @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23 the quantity @xmath24 is a coupling constant with the dimension of energy@xmath25 .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath26 describes the interaction of the unstable state @xmath3 with the ` decay - product ' state @xmath27 ; the energy @xmath28 is the energy of @xmath27 in the interaction free case .",
    "similar approaches to eq .",
    "( [ lh ] ) are used in other areas of physics , e.g. in quantum optics with the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .",
    "the spectral function @xmath5 arises as the imaginary part of the propagator , @xmath29   $ ] , and is correctly normalized , @xmath30 .",
    "the bw limit is obtained for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the decay width reads @xmath33 and the spectral function @xmath34   ^{-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "note , the choice @xmath32 means that the energy is not bounded from below and the choice @xmath31 means that the unstable state @xmath3 couples to each state of the continuum with the same intensity . for generic functions @xmath26 and @xmath28 the decay is not exponential ( see below ) , but is usually very well approximated by an exponential decay where the decay width is given by the fermi golden rule : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .    restricting to the bw limit",
    ", an interesting feature is found when studying the energy of the emitted spectrum . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the case of atomic spontaneous emission : an electron decays from an atomic excited state to the ground state by emitting a photon .",
    "this is indeed the original framework in which the decay was studied @xcite ( see also e.g. refs . @xcite and refs . therein ) . denoting @xmath37 as the energy difference between the excited and the ground state , the energy distribution of the photon at the time @xmath12 is given by @xmath38 .",
    "the energy uncertainty of the photon @xmath39 is given by the width at mid height : @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 one has @xmath42 , which is the natural broadening of the spectral line . for @xmath43 the quantity @xmath44 increases as @xmath45 .",
    "this means that , if measured at short times after the emission , the photon can have an energy which deviates from the mean value @xmath37 by several decay widths @xmath46 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    we now turn to the a simple example of non - exponential decay . to this end",
    ", we choose @xmath47 which means that the state @xmath3 couples _ only _ to an energy window of final states .",
    "a numerical example is shown in fig . 1 , in which the survival probability @xmath48 and its derivative , @xmath49 , are plotted ( solid lines ) and compared with the exponential counterparts ( dashed lines , obtained by using the fermi rule ) . deviations from the exponential decay are evident .",
    "note , the function @xmath50 has a clear physical meaning : @xmath51 is the probability that the decay occurs in the time - interval @xmath52 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath50 is also denoted as the density of decay probability .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    we now turn to the two - channel case , in which the unstable state @xmath10 couples to two sets of final states @xmath53 and @xmath54 the hamiltonian is a straightforward generalization of eq .",
    "( [ lh ] ) : @xmath55 in the bw limit @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants .",
    "the partial decay widths are @xmath60 and @xmath61 and the survival probability reads @xmath62 with @xmath63 .    in the presence of two decay channels , it is useful to introduce the quantity @xmath64 : @xmath65 is the probability that the state @xmath10 decays in the @xmath66-th channel between @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the bw limit @xmath69 and the ratio @xmath70 is a constant equal to @xmath71 . however ,",
    "when deviations from the exponential decay are considered , the ratio @xmath70 is in general not a constant , but shows sizable departures from @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this is shown for a particular numerical example in fig .",
    "2 , in which the choices @xmath73 and @xmath74 have been used .",
    "qft is the theoretical framework in which particles are created and annihilated .",
    "it is therefore the most fundamental environment to study the nature of decays . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was claimed that in qft the deviations from the exponential decay law do not take place .",
    "these conclusions , however , rely on a perturbative treatment of the decay law .",
    "this issue was ( re)analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite with the following results :    1 .   in ref .",
    "@xcite the superrenormalizable qft interaction lagrangian @xmath75 , leading to the decay @xmath76 , was studied in detail .",
    "the spectral function @xmath5 is calculated as the imaginary part of the propagator of @xmath77 to this end , it is necessary to perform a resummation of ( at least ) the one - loop self - energy diagram of the field @xmath78 .",
    "( namely , a perturbative expression of @xmath5 in a series of @xmath24 is not a meaningful quantity @xcite . )",
    "the survival probability takes the very same formal expression of eq .",
    "( [ at])and short - time deviations from the exponential law do occur @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , the time interval in which such deviations take place is independent on the cutoff @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the energy distribution @xmath5 behaves as @xmath79 for large energies , thus being insensitive on the high energy scale of the theory . +",
    "the two - channel case can be easily studied by using the lagrangian @xmath80 which implies that the two decay processes @xmath81 and @xmath82 take place .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 shows also in this qft framework qualitatively similar deviations from the constant bw limit as those in  fig .",
    "2 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for plots and details .",
    "2 .   in ref .",
    "@xcite the renormalizable interaction lagrangian @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a fermionic field , has been analyzed .",
    "( note , the higgs coupling to fermions has the same form . )",
    "the energy distribution @xmath5 scales only as @xmath85 which in turn implies that the presence of a high energy cutoff is necessary for its correct normalization .",
    "thus , the existence of a high energy cutoff is not only a mathematical step , but is a necessary physical requirement . in this framework ,",
    "the duration of the deviations from the exponential decay at short times lasts only @xmath86 and is thus very small if the high - energy cutoff @xmath87 is large .",
    "in this proceeding we have discussed the deviations from the exponential decay law in qm and qft . the decay law in  qm has been studied by using the lee hamiltonian approach @xcite and in qft by using relativistic qft lagrangians @xcite .    in qm",
    "we have discussed a peculiar property of the energy spectrum of the photon in a spontaneous emission process : even in the exponential limit , a broadening of the emitted spectrum is realized if the photon is measured at early times @xcite . as a next step",
    "we have studied short - time deviations from the exponential law in the simple case in which the unstable state couples to the continuum in a window of energy ( see fig . 1 and refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    a particularly interesting feature in both qm and",
    "qft is that of a decay in which two ( or more ) decay channels are present .",
    "the ratio of decay probability densities is a constant in the bw limit and equals the ratio of decay widths , but show sizable fluctuations on top of this constant limit when deviations from the bw limit are included ( see fig . 2 and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a systematic study of this ratio for a variety of cases , also including the analysis of realistic physical situations , is an important outlook for the future .            c. a. nicolaides and t. mercouris , journal of physics b * 29 * , issue 6 , pp .",
