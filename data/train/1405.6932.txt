    "hence it is expected that some order such as a magnetic or charge order is realized in the mott insulator phase in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , although it is difficult in this study to identify what the order is .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the two possible orders in the hamiltonian ( [ mf - hamiltonian ] ) , the @xmath167 order where no symmetry is broken and the @xmath168 order where both time - reversal and inversion symmetries are broken , are energetically degenerate . the result of this paper is not changed even though the @xmath168 order is considered as the gapped order instead of the @xmath167 order .",
    "thirdly , let us discuss the implications of our results to the stability of weyl semimetals .",
    "weyl semimetals have gapless 3d linear dispersions in the bulk , and the effective hamiltonians around the weyl nodes are described by not the dirac hamiltonian but the weyl hamiltonian @xmath169 where @xmath170 are the pauli matrices . at least either time - reversal or inversion symmetry breaking is required to realize a weyl semimetal phase @xcite .",
    "each weyl node possesses chirality defined by @xmath171=\\pm1 $ ] .",
    "the number of the weyl nodes with chirality @xmath172 and that of chirality @xmath173 must be equal in time - reversal symmetry broken weyl semimetals .",
    "for example , the weyl semimetal phase predicted by a first - principles calculation in pyrochlore iridates possesses 24 weyl nodes @xcite . here",
    "let us consider a simplified low - energy effective model for a weyl semimetal with @xmath174 nodes .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xmath175\\psi_{f+}(\\bm{k})\\right.\\\\ & \\quad\\left.+\\psi^\\dagger_{f-}(\\bm{k})\\left[-\\xi_ik_i\\sigma_i\\right]\\psi_{f-}(\\bm{k})\\right\\}\\\\ & = \\sum_{\\bm k}\\sum_{f=1}^n\\psi^\\dagger_{f}(\\bm{k})v_{{\\rm f}\\parallel } \\begin{bmatrix } \\xi_ik_i\\sigma_i & 0\\\\ 0 & -\\xi_ik_i\\sigma_i \\end{bmatrix } \\psi_{f}(\\bm{k } ) , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath176^t$ ] with @xmath177 being a two - component spinor , the subscript @xmath178 denotes the chirality of each weyl node , and we have introduced the fermi velocity anisotropy @xmath179 . by introducing the @xmath92 gamma matrices @xmath14 in the chiral representation , we obtain the low - energy effective action ( [ continuum - action ] ) .",
    "namely , this indicates that in a rough approximation , the low - energy effective model of a @xmath174-node weyl semimetal is equivalent to that of a @xmath0-node dirac semimetal .",
    "weyl semimetals have a topological property such that the energy gap opens only if the weyl nodes with opposite chirality meet each other , since a single weyl fermion can not be massive by itself . due to this property ,",
    "weyl semimetals are expected to be more stable against strong @xmath1 coulomb interactions than dirac semimetals .",
    "however , it is not easy to treat strong @xmath1 coulomb interactions properly in multinode weyl semimetals . in this study",
    ", it was found that the @xmath0-node dirac semimetals with @xmath2 and @xmath3 survive in the strong coupling limit .",
    "hence , it could be said that the @xmath180-node weyl semimetals with @xmath181 and @xmath182 also survive in the strong coupling limit when the fermi velocity anisotropy is weak . as for the cases of @xmath183",
    ", a recent study has reported that a weyl semimetal with @xmath184 survives in this limit @xcite .",
    "finally , let us discuss the implications of our results to the stability of 3d topological insulators .",
    "it is known that 3d topological insulators can be regarded as 3d dirac fermion systems . in the noninteracting cases ,",
    "the bulk energy gap closes when the phase transition from the topological insulator phase to the normal band insulator phase occurs .",
    "in other words , there exist dirac point(s ) in the bulk when the system is on the phase boundary between the topological insulator phase and the normal band insulator phase .",
    "for example , the fu - kane - mele model has three dirac points @xcite , and the effective model for bi@xmath5se@xmath4 has one dirac point @xcite on their phase boundaries .",
    "what about in the interacting cases ?",
    "the phase transitions from the topological insulator phase to the other phases can occur without the gap closing , when accompanying the breaking of symmetry of the system such as time - reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry .",
    "however , the gap closing is required when no symmetry is broken , as in the noninteracting cases . from this viewpoint ,",
    "our result , that the dirac semimetals survives in the strong coupling limit , suggests that 3d topological insulator phases can be stable against strong @xmath1 coulomb interactions .",
    "actually , a recent study has reported that a 3d topological insulator phase of bi@xmath5se@xmath4-type survives in the strong coupling limit when the spin - orbit interaction of the system is strong @xcite .",
    "in summary , based on the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory , we have studied the stability of @xmath0-node dirac semimetals in three spatial dimensions with @xmath2 and @xmath3 against strong @xmath1 long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "it was shown that the dirac semimetals survive in the strong coupling limit when the fermi velocity anisotropy is weak , whereas they change to mott insulators when the anisotropy is strong .",
    "this means that the three - dimensionality of the dirac cones plays an important role in the stability .",
    "the value of the dynamically generated mass gap at least for the @xmath2 case is expected to be quantitatively correct .",
    "a possible global phase diagram of correlated dirac semimetals was presented .",
    "dirac semimetals can lead to various topological phases by the change of parameters or symmetry breakings .",
    "our result , that dirac semimetals are stable against strong @xmath1 long - range coulomb interactions , implies the stability of other topological phases .",
    "namely , it is suggested that weyl semimetals , which correspond to dirac semimetals in a rough approximation , can survive in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the existence of 3d topological insulator phases in the strong coupling limit is also suggested .",
