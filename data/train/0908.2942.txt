    "consider a family of bounded domains @xmath0 in the plane ( or more generally euclidean space or a riemannian manifold ) depending on a real parameter @xmath1 .",

    "homotopy of eigenfunctions _ we mean a continuous family of eigenfunctions @xmath9 with eigenvalues @xmath10 ( also varying continuously in @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 for a reasonable domain @xmath0 there is a complete orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions .",
    "we do not expect every eigenfunction to belong to a homotopy .",
    "if the eigenvalue is simple , then it is easy to see that the ( unique up to a constant ) eigenfunction does belong to a homotopy for at least a small interval in the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , if the eigenspace has higher multiplicity at a fixed value of @xmath1 , the best we can expect is that there is a special basis of eigenfunctions that belong to a homotopy .",
    "we face the same situation if we consider a continuous family @xmath13 of symmetric @xmath14 matrices .",
    "the eigenvalues depend continuously on @xmath1 , but the eigenvectors do not necessarily vary continuously . for example , let @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xmath17 symmetric matrices with different eigenvectors .",
    "one can avoid this pathology by assuming that the derivative with respect to @xmath1 is nonzero , or that the dependence on @xmath1 is analytic .",
    "however , if @xmath18 where @xmath19 has distinct eigenvectors , then for @xmath20 , the matrix has eigenspace corresponding to @xmath21 containing all vectors , whereas only the eigenvectors of @xmath19 belong to homotopies .",
    "observe now that the double eigenvalue of @xmath13 at @xmath20 is unstable under perturbation . more specifically ,",
    "recall that matrices with multiple eigenvalues , considered as a subspace of @xmath14 symmetric matrices , have codimension @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , those matrices with multiple eigenvalues in @xmath14 hermitian matrices have codimension @xmath23 .",
    "so , for a generic one - parameter family of self - adjoint matrices , multiple eigenvalues are very rare .",
    "moreover , in the self - adjoint case , if two eigenvalues move near each other ( say , as @xmath1 increases ) , the eigenvalues then repel each other .",
    "we can see this from the following equation ( derived below as in the article `` when are eigenvalues stable ? ''",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 eigenfunction ( an @xmath27 normalized column vector ) , @xmath28 is the @xmath29 eigenvalue , @xmath30 denotes complex transpose , and @xmath31 denotes a derivative in the @xmath1 variable .",

    "( [ one2.55 ] ) and using the previous sentence gives @xmath37 notice we have also used the fact that @xmath38 which is just the eigenvalue equation for @xmath25 with the adjoint taken on both sides .",

    "( [ one2.61 ] ) and the orthogonality of the eigenvectors to the result to obtain @xmath41 so , re - writing , summing over @xmath42 , using the completeness of the eigenvectors ( and recalling that @xmath43 ) gives @xmath44 now , differentiating eq .",
    "( [ one2.6 ] ) gives @xmath45 and after applying eq .",
    "( [ one2.65 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ one2.67 ] ) , we finally get eq .",
    "( [ one2.5 ] ) .",
    "we now wish to comment further on the significance of eq .",
    "( [ one2.5 ] ) .",
    "the repulsion of two distinct eigenvalues , or level repulsion , manifests in the second term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ one2.5 ] ) .",
    "that is , if we increase @xmath1 linearly , and two eigenvalues @xmath46 and @xmath47 move close together , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ one2.5 ] ) becomes very large ( assuming the numerator does not vanish ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath48 has a term of the form @xmath49 , while @xmath50 has a term of the form @xmath51 .",
    "so , the larger of the two eigenvalues is forced upward , and the smaller of the two is forced downward .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ one2.5 ] ) accounts for generic eigenvalue repulsion , in this finite dimensional case .",
    "now , can these observations carry over to the infinite dimensional setting ?",
    "we are concerned here with eigenvalue repulsion and rarity of multiple eigenvalues .",
    "specifically , do these effects occur for compact planar domains which vary with a time parameter ? to a certain extent , yes . restricting an infinite dimensional operator to finitely many dimensions as in eq .",
    "( [ one5 ] ) below , the repulsion effects from the finite dimensional hermitian case should carry over to self - adjoint operators .",
    "( for rigorous results on the rarity of multiple eigenvalues , see @xcite . )    mimicking the finite dimensional case , we reformulate our original problem by taking a fixed domain @xmath52 and varying the differential operator .",
    "we assume that we have a family of diffeomorphisms @xmath53 that depends analytically on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "then we can pull back the euclidean metric on @xmath0 to a riemannian metric on @xmath52 .",
    "the pullback of the standard laplacian on @xmath0 becomes the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath52 , which we denote by @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , we can pull back the energy and measure on @xmath0 to the corresponding quantities on @xmath52 for the riemannian metric .",
    "we note that the neumann boundary conditions correspond , and also the coefficients of @xmath2 are analytic functions in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath54 $ ] be any finite interval in @xmath55 such that the endpoints are not neumann eigenvalues of any @xmath2 ( to do this we may have to restrict the interval in which @xmath1 varies ) .",
    "then the spectral projection operator @xmath56)$ ] associated with @xmath57 and the interval @xmath54 $ ] is well - defined and of finite rank , and may be expressed as a contour integral in the resolvent @xmath58 for a suitable contour @xmath59 in the complex plane enclosing the interval .",
    "the resolvent depends analytically on @xmath1 ( this may be seen via the pseudodifferential calculus , for example ) , so the projection operator also depends analytically * on * @xmath1 .",
    "if the rank of the projection operator is @xmath60 , we can find an @xmath60-dimensional space @xmath61 of functions such that @xmath56)$ ] maps @xmath61 onto its range .",

    "now we are in the finite dimensional setting with a family of operators depending analytically on the parameter , so @xmath60 homotopies of eigenfunctions exist , and these yield @xmath60 homotopies of eigenfunctions @xmath66 on @xmath52 .",
    "once we have the existence of homotopies for small intervals of the parameter and bounded regions of the spectrum , we can combine them to obtain global homotopies for the whole spectrum . if @xmath67 is an eigenfunction corresponding to a simple eigenvalue @xmath68 of @xmath69",
    ", then there is a unique homotopy @xmath66 with @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath68 is an eigenvalue of @xmath69 with nontrivial multiplicity , then its eigenspace @xmath71 has a basis of eigenvectors which lie in homotopies .",
    "in fact one can take this basis to be orthonormal .",
    "suppose for example , that @xmath68 has multiplicity @xmath22 , and let @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote @xmath22 homotopies with eigenvalues @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "then either @xmath76 for all @xmath1 or @xmath77 for @xmath78 . in the first case",
    "we may take linear combinations of @xmath72 and @xmath73 to obtain orthogonality . in the second case",
    "we have the orthogonality of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath78 ( because the eigenvalues are distinct ) , and by continuity it must hold for @xmath79 .    the deeper question , however , is what is the significance of the homotopies ? if we have homotopies between domains @xmath6 and @xmath7 then we have a pairing up of the eigenfunctions on @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "what does this tell us about the paired eigenfunctions ?",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate this question experimentally .",
    "we examine two different examples . in the first , something of a warmup exercise , we take @xmath6",
    "be a circle and @xmath7 to be a square .",
    "we know exactly what the eigenfunctions are at both endpoints .",
    "for the unit circle , using polar coordinates , the eigenspaces typically have multiplicity @xmath22 and are spanned by @xmath80 and @xmath81 where the eigenvalues @xmath82 are the successive zeroes of @xmath83 , indexed by @xmath84 . here",
    "the exceptional case @xmath86 yields a @xmath87-dimensional eigenspace spanned by @xmath88 . for the unit square",
    ", there is a basis of eigenfunctions of the form @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 with eigenvalues @xmath92 .",
    "typical eigenspaces have dimension @xmath87 ( @xmath93 ) or @xmath22 ( @xmath40 ) , but higher multiplicity may occur due to coincidences , such as @xmath94 or @xmath95 .    in order to simplify and clarify the discussion we consider the action of the dihedral symmetry group @xmath96 on the eigenspaces .",
    "@xmath96 acts on the circle and square and all the domains we consider .",
    "it is well known that this @xmath97 element group has @xmath98 irreducible representations , one being @xmath22-dimensional and the others @xmath87-dimensional .",
    "each eigenspace either transforms according to one of these representations or splits into a direct sum of such pieces , and the homotopies respect the representation types .",
    "we denote the @xmath87-dimensional representations @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where the first @xmath101 refers to the symmetry or skew - symmetry with respect to diagonal reflections , and the second @xmath101 refers to the symmetry or skew - symmetry with respect to horizontal and vertical reflections .",
    "we now describe the eigenspaces sorted according to representation type for the circle and the square .",
    "@xmath102 the eigenspace @xmath103 is generated by + @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath84    @xmath106 the eigenspace @xmath107 is generated by + @xmath108 for @xmath85 and @xmath84    @xmath109 the eigenspace @xmath110 is generated by + @xmath111 for @xmath105 and @xmath84    @xmath112 the eigenspace @xmath113 is generated by + @xmath114 for @xmath105 and @xmath84    @xmath115 the eigenspace @xmath116 is generated by + @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath105 and @xmath84    @xmath102 the eigenspace @xmath119 is generated by + @xmath120 for @xmath121    @xmath106 the eigenspace @xmath122 is generated by + @xmath123 for @xmath124    @xmath109 the eigenspace @xmath125 is generated by + @xmath126 for @xmath121    @xmath112 the eigenspace @xmath127 is generated by + @xmath128 for @xmath124    @xmath115 the @xmath22-dimensional eigenspace @xmath129 is generated by + @xmath130 and @xmath131 for @xmath121    in the case of the square , because of coincidences , the full eigenspace associated with a given eigenvalue may be a direct sum of some of the spaces described above , for example @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "when we construct homotopies , we often find that they do not pass through the individual summands .",
    "this problem does not arise for the circle , since as far as we know there are no coincidences among the eigenvalues @xmath82 .    in section [ secctos ]",
    "we describe the homotopies of eigenfunctions for two different analytic families of domains joining the circle to a square . in one ,",
    "the circle expands out to a square in horizontal / vertical orientation , and in the other the circle contracts in to a square in diagonal orientation .",
    "( the fact that these are not unit squares just requires a trivial adjustment . ) in both cases the homotopies connect the same @xmath134 and @xmath135 eigenspaces .",
    "we observe a canonical splitting of two - dimensional eigenspaces at the endpoints of the homotopy .",
    "we also do not find any two - dimensional eigenspaces away from the endpoints of the homotopy .",
    "in our second example in section [ seccarp ] we consider a sequence of domains @xmath136 that approximate the sierpinski carpet ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the similarities that map to square @xmath139 into the squares of the `` picture frame '' @xmath140 that is @xmath139 with the middle ninth removed .",
    "then @xmath141 and @xmath142 in a previous work @xcite we gave experimental evidence that the spectra of the neumann laplacians on @xmath143 converge , after the appropriate renormalization , to the spectrum of the neumann laplacian on @xmath137 , with the eigenfunctions also converging .",
    "in other words , there is a complete orthonormal basis @xmath144 of eigenfunctions @xmath145 on @xmath143 with neumann boundary conditions such that @xmath146 @xmath147 for some @xmath148 .",
    "we would then identify @xmath149 as the neumann eigenfunctions of the barlow - bass laplacian @xmath8 on @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the recently announced proof @xcite of the uniqueness of that laplacian justifies this identification . combining this uniqueness result , the resolvent convergence @xcite ( see  7 ) , and the relation @xmath150 $ ] between the laplacian @xmath8 and brownian motion @xmath151 , suggest a method of rigorous proof of eq .",
    "( [ one10 ] ) .",
    "the relation @xmath150 $ ] is important because it shows that the speeding up of the brownian motion @xcite exactly corresponds to multiplication of @xmath8 by a constant .",
    "however , even with convergence in eq .",
    "( [ one10 ] ) , there is an obstacle to uncovering the dynamics of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that , for a given @xmath152 , the eigenvalues @xmath153 are not necessarily in increasing order ( with respect to the original ordering for @xmath154 ) . in order to better understand the discrete sequence @xmath144 of eigenfunctions , we embed them in homotopies . for example , to connect the square @xmath139 with the picture frame @xmath140 , we first remove the center of the square . since points have zero capacity in the square , this does not change the neumann laplacian .",
    "we then gradually enlarge the hole by deleting squares in the center with side length going from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "similarly , to go from @xmath140 to @xmath157 we enlarge @xmath97 holes in the center of the squares @xmath158 with side length going from @xmath155 to @xmath159 .",
    "we carried out the computation of these homotopies up to @xmath160 .",
    "( note that it would also be possible to do a single deformation from @xmath139 to @xmath160 by opening all holes simultaneously . )",
    "some eigenfunctions change only slightly during the course of the homotopy ; we could say that they make minor adjustments to the changing domains .",
    "however , most eigenfunctions show considerable variation , especially for higher eigenvalues . ideally we would hope to make a reasonable guess from the shape of @xmath161 as to which @xmath162 it is connected to .",
    "we are very far from being able to do this .",
    "in fact , the following cautionary tale shows some of the obstacles .",
    "if @xmath42 and @xmath163 are divisible by @xmath23 , then all the eigenfunctions in any of the @xmath164 spaces are also neumann eigenfunctions on @xmath140 ( when restricted to @xmath140 ) .",
    "however , many of the homotopies do not connect the restriction to @xmath140 with the original eigenfunction on @xmath139 .",
    "let @xmath165 denote the line @xmath166 in the closed first quadrant",
    ". in polar coordinates @xmath167 is parameterized by the equation @xmath168 , @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "then , the map @xmath170 defined in the closed first quadrant takes the arc of the circle of radius @xmath87 centered at the origin to the line @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , it also maps the arc of the circle of radius @xmath171 to the line @xmath172 . with this in mind , let @xmath173\\times{\\mathbb{r}}^{2}\\to{\\mathbb{r}}^{2}$ ] be the homotopy @xmath174 for @xmath169 $ ] , this is the straight - line homotopy between the identity map of @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "so , as we vary @xmath1 , @xmath177 restricted to the closed first quadrant maps the square diamond of side length @xmath178 to the unit disc .",
    "observe that for @xmath179 , @xmath177 ( with the same restriction ) maps the square to a half - ellipse .",
    "rotating the domain and range of the map into all four quadrants , we get a straight - line homotopy which connects the square diamond to the unit disc and which is analytic in the time parameter @xmath1 on @xmath180 ( and continuous on @xmath181 $ ] ) .",
    "if we view @xmath182 as an analytic deformation of the standard metric on the unit disc , the neumann laplacian @xmath2 on the disc is a holomorphic family of type ( a ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then , theorem 3.9,vii.4.5 from the same book says the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be represented as functions holomorphic in @xmath1 .",
    "more specifically , the eigenvalues are holomorphic functions and the eigenfunctions can be chosen to be holomorphic with a banach space as their range . in our terminology",
    ", we have an ( analytic ) homotopy of eigenfunctions .",
    "this is the theoretical basis of our investigation .",
    "an analogous process can be achieved for @xmath183 and @xmath184 where @xmath185 maps the unit circle in the first quadrant to the square diamond of side length @xmath22 , and upon reflection as above , @xmath186 gives a straight line homotopy between the identity map on the unit circle and @xmath187 .",
    "again , we get a straight - line homotopy from the unit disc to the square , and with previously mentioned results @xcite , we have a homotopy of eigenfunctions .",
    "note that @xmath186 and @xmath177 are not identical .",
    "since all of our domains are invariant under the @xmath96 symmetry group , we can simplify the eigenfunction computations by reducing to a fundamental domain . on this domain",
    "we impose appropriate boundary conditions according to the representation type . for the @xmath87-dimensional representation ,",
    "we restrict to the sector @xmath188 . recall that the functions will extend evenly when reflected about @xmath189 in the @xmath190 and @xmath191 cases , and oddly in the @xmath192 and @xmath100 cases . when reflecting about @xmath193",
    ", the functions will extend evenly in the @xmath190 and @xmath192 cases , and oddly in the @xmath191 and @xmath100 cases . note that performing an even extension across a ray is equivalent to imposing neumann boundary conditions on that ray .",
    "similarly , the odd extension is equivalent to dirichlet conditions .    for the @xmath22-dimensional representation",
    "our fundamental domain is the sector @xmath194 , and we impose neumann boundary conditions on the ray @xmath189 and dirichlet conditions on the ray @xmath195 . notice that our fundamental domains are simply connected .",
    "therefore , as in theorem 6.4 of @xcite , we should expect no two - dimensional eigenspaces along this homotopy ( for each individual symmetry family ) .    in order for matlab r2006a to understand our geometry",
    ", we must give the geometric data to the program in its desired format . to accomplish this task in matlab s pde toolbox for a fixed @xmath1",
    ", we specify polygons and circles . more specifically , we specify the vertices of the polygon and the center and radius of a circle , with standard coordinates in the plane .",
    "once we input this data , we then fix a closed interval of the real line in which we look for eigenvalues @xmath196 .",
    "the program then uses the arnoldi algorithm with function ` pdeeig ` to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath197 for @xmath196 in the specified interval . for this particular homotopy , this process yields sixty to seventy eigenvalues within minutes . as our first approximation to a smooth homotopy using @xmath177 or @xmath186 , we solve for eigenfunctions at times @xmath198 . for",
    "now , matlab s solution method is sufficient . however , other solvers based in different programs may be more effective in the future .",
    "for instance , the boundary element method appears much more efficient than the finite element method .    in the following diagrams ,",
    "we show the observed eigenvalue dynamics for each of the five symmetry families ( @xmath199 ) . for convenience ,",
    "we divide all eigenvalues by @xmath200 .",
    "as stated above , the data is collected for @xmath198 .",
    "as @xmath1 varies , we determine whether or not two eigenvalues cross by inference ( see below for more details ) .",
    "observe that the eigenvalue plots exhibit eigenvalue repulsion , as in eq .",
    "( [ one2.5 ] ) in the finite dimensional setting .",
    "when two eigenvalues draw near each other , they `` collide '' and then veer away rapidly ( see fig .",
    "[ figthirteen.5 ] ( a ) below ) .",
    "intuitively , when two eigenvalues move near each other , one could imagine a slightly perturbed geometry for which these eigenvalues would be the same .",
    "indeed , the eigenfunctions also support this intuition .",
    "if we examine the eigenfunctions before and after the collision , we see that they swap identities .",
    "that is , if we have eigenvalues @xmath201 which collide around @xmath79 , then @xmath202 looks like @xmath203 , and @xmath204 looks like @xmath205 . in the intermediate region @xmath206 , we then observe two linear combinations of our eigenfunctions @xmath202 and @xmath204",
    ". this effect has been observed before @xcite and coined the superposition effect .",
    "notice that this superposition effect only occurs among eigenfunctions of the same symmetry class .    when a two - dimensional eigenspace occurs ( analytically ) ,",
    "the superposition effect is sometimes not observed numerically .",
    "for example , consider eigenfunctions @xmath207 and @xmath208 from the @xmath209 family on the square .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ figone ] that these two eigenfunctions separate from the two dimensional eigenspace at @xmath210 , as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "a priori , this two - dimensional eigenspace could split into any two ( orthogonal ) eigenfunctions from a two - parameter family @xmath211 .",
    "however , we see from figs .",
    "[ figsix ] and [ figsix.1 ] that these eigenfunctions appear to split according to the canonical eigenfunctions on the square .",
    "this behavior is consistently observed for this homotopy .",
    "we will see in section [ seccarp ] different behavior for that homotopy",
    ".    additionally , observe the closely bound eigenfunctions in some of our eigenvalue plots .",
    "that is , as @xmath1 varies in our homotopy , we see two eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues remain very close for all @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is puzzling for the authors to explain , and it is unclear whether it only occurs in the lower part of the spectrum .",
    "we observe this effect for eigenfunctions @xmath212 and @xmath213 in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] and eigenfunctions @xmath98 and @xmath214 in fig .",
    "[ figfive ] .",
    "this effect is not observed in our homotopy of section [ seccarp ] .",
    "also note that certain eigenvalues change in similar ways .",
    "for instance , eigenvalues @xmath215,@xmath216 , and @xmath217 of the circle in the @xmath209 family all have noticeably negative slope around @xmath218 .",
    "this observation indicates that patterns occur in our eigenfunction homotopies . in other words",
    ", it seems that sets of similar eigenfunctions behave in similar ways in the homotopies .    in fig .",
    "[ figsix ] , we depict the homotopy of eigenfunctions of eigenvalue @xmath215 of the circle in the @xmath209 family . in fig .",
    "[ figseven ] , we show this same homotopy restricted to the positive @xmath219-axis .    in fig [ figeight ]",
    ", we take the same homotopy as in figs .",
    "[ figsix ] and [ figseven ] , but for simplicity we only examine the nodal set of the eigenfunction .",
    "we approximate this nodal set by the inverse image of a small neighborhood of @xmath155 of the form @xmath220 .    in fig .",
    "[ fignine ] we depict the homotopy of eigenvalue @xmath212 on the circle in the @xmath221 family . in fig .",
    "[ figten ] we show the homotopy of the corresponding nodal set , as in fig . [ figeight ] .",
    "observe from figs .",
    "[ figone]-[figfive ] that the endpoints of the graphs of the eigenvalues give a bijection between the eigenfunctions on the circle and those on the square .",
    "since this bijection may encapsulate information about our homotopy or the eigenfunctions themselves , we examine it . for simplicity",
    ", we view the correspondences of the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions . figs .",
    "[ figeleven1]-[figeleven5 ] displays pictorially some of these correspondences and table [ tableone ] displays all of the data in terms of eigenfunction labels . for instance",
    ", we find nontrivial information about the splitting of the two - dimensional eigenspaces on the endpoints ( corresponding to @xmath20 and @xmath210 ) .    how do we actually determine existence or non - existence of a two - dimensional eigenspace as we vary @xmath1 in an eigenfunction homotopy ?",
    "since different symmetry families do not interact , it is easy to see when two eigenvalues from different symmetry families cross .",
    "for instance , if we combine the ( non - interacting ) eigenvalues of figs .",
    "[ figone]-[figfive ] in a single plot , we will definitely have crossings .",
    "but for eigenfunctions in the same symmetry family , we can not rigorously determine from the experimental data whether or not two eigenvalues cross , since we are only approximating the smooth functions @xmath186 and @xmath222 in discrete time . yet , as we vary the discrete time parameter , the graphs of the ( lower eigenvalue ) eigenfunctions change very slowly .",
    "so , if two eigenvalues are far apart , and their corresponding eigenfunctions look similar as we vary @xmath1 , then ( trivially ) these two eigenvalues do not attain the same value .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ figone ] , eigenvalues @xmath87 and @xmath212 on the circle ( where @xmath20 ) are far apart , and their eigenfunctions look entirely different as we vary @xmath1 . therefore , these eigenvalues do not cross .",
    "subtlety arises when two eigenvalues are very close together .",
    "if a multiple eigenvalue exists , our numerical methods will not give us two identical eigenvalues .",
    "this effect is a result of the instability of two - dimensional eigenspaces discussed in section [ secintro ] .",
    "since we are given approximate solutions to the eigenvalue problem , we will get two distinct eigenvalues which are very close together . measuring",
    "the difference will tell us the approximate ( relative ) error of our numerical method .",
    "given two nearly identical computed eigenvalues @xmath223 at @xmath79 , we are therefore interested in the quantity @xmath224    for eigenspaces that we know have multiplicity , we find that @xmath225 .",
    "recall from above that , with respect to our eigenvalue data , a collision ( see fig .",

    "[ figsix ] , [ figseven ] and [ figeight ] . in all three figures , we see what appears to be a discontinuity in the homotopy around @xmath218 .    this apparent discontinuity occurs since the numerical computations we have used can not tell the difference between a two - dimensional eigenspace and an almost two dimensional eigenspace .",
    "in other words , for two close eigenvalues , the solver combines two distinct eigenfunctions .",
    "our intuition used above can also apply here : quite possibly , an eigenvalue collision is just a perturbation ( geometric or otherwise ) of a true two - dimensional eigenspace .",
    "once again , this is a manifestation of the superposition effect @xcite .",
    "the data shows two linear combinations of the true eigenfunctions , instead of a separation into two non - interacting eigenspaces . to assuage these concerns ,",
    "we make higher precision calculations with a higher number of time values @xmath1 around the potential two - dimensional eigenspace .",
    "we then use the relative error of eq .",
    "( [ two3 ] ) to determine whether or not a two - dimensional eigenspace occurs .",
    "if a two - dimensional eigenspace is determined to occur , we then incorporate the eigenfunction data and the fact that the eigenvalues vary analytically ( recall theorem 3.9,vii.4.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the higher and lower eigenfunctions swap appearances around the multiple eigenvalue , then the eigenvalues cross . if no such swap occurs , the eigenvalues do not cross .",
    "this completes our analysis of the spectral dynamics .",
    "let us demonstrate the above procedure by example .",
    "along the homotopy @xmath177 for the @xmath221 family , we see from fig .",
    "[ figfour ] that eigenvalues @xmath212 and @xmath213 on the circle ( @xmath20 ) get very close together at @xmath231 .",

    "@xmath232 again shows ambiguous behavior at @xmath231 . to make our analysis more precise",

    "for instance , at @xmath237 , the normalized eigenvalues are separated by about @xmath238 , giving a relative error @xmath239 .",
    "so , we conclude that no two - dimensional eigenspace has occurred within this time interval . for an example with a two - dimensional eigenspace with no apparent crossing ( i.e. where the ordering of the two eigenvalues does not change ) , see figs [ figtwentysix ] and [ figtwentysix.1 ] in section [ seccarp ]",
    ".    to summarize the different eigenvalue dynamics , we display figs .",

    "[ figthirteen.5 ] shows three different eigenvalue interactions ( all from eigenvalue computations ) , and fig .",
    "[ figthirteen.6 ] shows the gaps between each of the respective pairs of eigenvalues .",
    "if we examine the axes of these figures carefully , we see that part ( a ) has a pair of eigenvalues which do not come close enough together for a two - dimensional eigenspace to occur .",
    "this reaffirms our recent observations of figs .",
    "[ figtwelve ] and [ figthirteen ] . from these same figures",

    "[ figtwentysix ] and [ figtwentysix.1 ] that the eigenfunctions do not swap identities . therefore , this is a _ non - crossing_. in part ( c ) , we find evidence for a two - dimensional eigenspace , and we observe the swapping of eigenfunction identities in figs .

    "therefore , this is a _",
    "crossing_.    we note that the same effect of nearby eigenspaces also occurs on the square .",
    "recall that on the square , we have several two dimensional eigenspaces .",
    "so , the choice of two orthogonal eigenfunctions by our numerical method from such an eigenspace amounts to two arbitrary linear combinations of the true eigenfunctions .",
    "however , as in fig .",
    "[ figsix ] , we see that , as we approach the square ( around @xmath241 ) , we approach a particular eigenfunction in a two - dimensional eigenspace on the square . since the eigenfunctions vary analytically , the homotopy of eigenfunctions therefore selects for us a member of the two dimensional eigenspace on the square .",
    "it is then interesting to note that , in our observed data , the eigenfunction thus selected is always a `` natural '' eigenfunction on the square , i.e. an eigenfunction of the form @xmath242 , rather than a linear combination of two such eigenfunctions .",
    "however , in the homotopy of section [ seccarp ] , we often see that a two - dimensional eigenspace on the square splits into two one - dimensional eigenspaces in the non-``natural '' way .",
    "more specifically , the numerical evidence shows a few two - dimensional eigenspaces definitely split in a non - canonical way ( see figs .",

    "therefore , as in theorem 6.4 of @xcite , we should expect no eigenvalue crossings along this homotopy ( for each individual symmetry family ) . since eigenvalue crossings do in fact occur , this suggests that there is something exceptional ( i.e. non - generic ) about our domains .",
    "the appearance of these crossings could be related to the quantum - classical correspondence principle .",
    "more specifically , since the billiard flow is not ergodic in phase space , this may suggest a dense number of crossings .    in figs .",

    "it is interesting to note how the two dimensional eigenspaces split for @xmath286 as we move @xmath1 from @xmath155 to some small @xmath287 . in section [ secctos ] ,",
    "we saw a `` canonical splitting '' for the given homotopy .",
    "however , the eigenfunctions for @xmath288 for two dimensional eigenspaces do not resemble the natural eigenfunctions of @xmath289 .",
    "for example , in figs .",
    "[ figtwentyfour ] and [ figtwentyfour.1 ] , we see the two - dimensional eigenspace on the square split with an apparent discontinuity . in figs .",
    "[ figtwentyfive ] and [ figtwentyfive.1 ] , we see a ( non - canonical ) splitting of the two - dimensional eigenspace on the square .",
    "if this were a canonical splitting , we would have the @xmath290 and @xmath291 eigenfunctions . however , there is no direct resemblence of our computed eigenfunctions and the canonical ones .",
    "in fact , around @xmath292 , these eigenfunctions cross again , since the relative error between the eigenvalues is about @xmath293 ( recall the discussion around eq .",
    "( [ two3 ] ) . finally , in figs .",
    "[ figtwentysix ] and [ figtwentysix.1 ] we show the homotopy around an ( analytically determined ) two - dimensional eigenspace at @xmath240 .",
    "it is not hard to find infinite sets of such eigenspaces for any rational @xmath179 .",
    "we now summarize our results . in both of our homotopies ,",
    "we preserve the @xmath96 symmetry of the domains .",
    "this allows us to split the eigenfunctions on these domains into five non - interacting families .",
    "that is , the behavior of eigenfunctions in one symmetry family along the homotopy does not affect the other families .",
    "the following is then clear : eigenvalues of one symmetry family definitely cross with eigenvalues of other symmetry families .",
    "however , the numerical evidence leads us to speculate on the individual symmetry families as follows . when we deform the circle to the square",
    ", we observe no intermediate two - dimensional eigenspaces .",
    "however , when we deform the square to the picture frame ( a square with a smaller square removed from the center ) we do find intermediate two - dimensional eigenspaces .",
    "in fact , analytically one can easily find an arbitrarily large number nontrivial multiplicity eigenspaces for a fixed rational time .",
    "when we observe our domains , we see that the deformation of the circle to the square is a convex diamond - shaped region for all @xmath294 $ ] .",
    "in fact , for @xmath179 , the region is a diamond with four edges , each of which is a half - ellipse .",
    "however , as we map the square @xmath139 to the picture frame @xmath140 via @xmath177 , we always have a rational polygon ( a polygon with angles which are rational multiples of @xmath295 ) .",
    "mapping @xmath136 to @xmath296 via @xmath297 always yields a rational domain with a finite number of flat edges ( which is now multiply connected for @xmath298 ) .",
    "recall : ( a ) after reducing multiplicities due to symmetry , we observe eigenvalues of nontrivial multiplicity for @xmath259 but not @xmath177 . also , ( b ) for @xmath297 we observe non - canonical splitting of two - dimensional eigenspaces of the square , and for @xmath177 we only observe canonical splitting .    with respect to observation ( a )",
    ", it is tempting to make a connection between the appearance of eigenvalue multiplicity and ergodicity of the billiard flow , but such a connection is unclear .",
    "such considerations seem related to the quantum - classical correspondence , and some conjectures discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the author mentions that , for the bottom part of the spectrum , the eigenvalues for integrable billiards may follow a poisson distribution , while the eigenvalues for a chaotic system may follow a goe ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) distribution . with respect to observation ( b ) , the authors have no clear explanation .",
    "we have just discussed possible connections between ergodicity of billiard flow and eigenvalue properties .",
    "such connections are collected under the so - called quantum - classical correspondence . perhaps extending these connections",
    "further , we discuss the localization and near - localization ( or scarring ) of eigenfunctions . for the standard laplacian on the sierpinski gasket ( @xmath299 ) ,",
    "many eigenfunctions are localized @xcite .",
    "indeed , it appears that for many symmetric pcf fractals , the symmetry of the fractal and the capability to break it into disjoint pieces by removing finitely many points contributes to the localization of eigenfunctions .",
    "in contrast , we have @xmath137 , which is a symmetric non - pcf fractal ( intuitively , this means it can not be broken up into smaller pieces by removing finitely many points ) .",
    "we now ask : do the `` stronger '' connectivity properties of @xmath137 forbid localized eigenfunctions ?",
    "we believe the numerical evidence from this paper suggests , yes .",
    "indeed , no localized eigenfunctions appear in the computations .",
    "if the outer approximation method of @xcite actually works , then this observation finds strong support . for possible counter - evidence ,",
    "let us consider the results of @xcite , which imply that any rectangular portion of a domain almost always exhibits eigenfunction scarring ( that is , having mass concentrated in the domain in a non - equidistributed way ) .",
    "this would imply that the number of scarred modes for our domains should increase exponentially as @xmath300 as in eq .",
    "( [ one10 ] ) .",
    "however , it is unclear whether a scarred eigenfunction for a fixed @xmath42 would remain scarred as @xmath42 increases .",
    "if the outer approximation method of @xcite holds , then the eigenfunction scarring may have repercussions for the eigenfunctions on @xmath137 , even though strict localization may not occur .",
