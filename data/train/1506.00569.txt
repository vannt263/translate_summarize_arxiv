    "this paper is concerned with the optimal control of mechanical systems of the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is valued in an open subset @xmath3 of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , on which the potential @xmath6 is defined .",
    "the second equation describes the variation of the mass , @xmath7 , of the system when a control is used ( @xmath8 is some nonnegative constant ) .",
    "the finite dimensional norm is euclidean , @xmath9 and a constraint on the control is assumed , @xmath10 given boundary conditions in the @xmath11-dimensional state ( phase ) space @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , the problem of interest is the minimization of consumption , that is the maximization of the final mass @xmath14 for a fixed final time .",
    "clearly , this amounts to minimizing the @xmath0-norm of the control , @xmath15 up to some rescaling , there are actually two cases , @xmath16 or @xmath17 . in the second one ,",
    "the mass is constant ; though maximizing the final mass does not make sense anymore , the lagrange cost ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is still meaningful .",
    "actually , as propellant is only a limited fraction of the total mass , one can expect this idealized constant mass model to capture the main features of the original problem .",
    "we shall henceforth assume @xmath17 , so the state reduces to @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "in finite dimensions , @xmath20-minimization is well - known to generate sparse solutions having a lot of zero components ; this fact translates here into the existence of subintervals of time where the control vanishes , as is clear when applying the maximum principle ( see  [ s2 ] ) .",
    "this intuitively goes along well with the idea of minimizing consumption : there are privileged values of the state where the control is more efficient and should be switched on ( _ burn _ arcs ) , while there are some others where it should be switched off ( _ cost _ arcs ) .",
    "( see also @xcite for a different kind of interpretation in a biological setting , again with @xmath0-minimization . )",
    "the resulting sparsity of the solution is then tuned by the ratio of the fixed final time over the minimum time associated with the boundary conditions : while a simple consequence of the form of the dynamics ( and of the ball constraint on the control ) is that the min .",
    "time control norm is constant and maximum everywhere for the constant mass model , . ]",
    "the extra amount of time available allows for some optimization that results in the existence of subarcs of the trajectory with zero control .",
    "( see proposition  [ prop2.1 ] , in this respect . )",
    "a salient peculiarity of the infinite dimensional setting is the existence of subarcs with intermediate value of the norm of the control , namely singular arcs .",
    "this was analyzed in the seminal paper of robbins @xcite in the case of the two - body potential , providing yet another example of the fruitful exchanges between space mechanics and optimal control in the early years of both disciplines .",
    "the consequence of these singular arcs being of order two was further realized by marchal who studied chattering in @xcite ; this example comes probably second after the historical one of fuller @xcite and has been thoroughly investigated by zelikin and borisov in @xcite .",
    "a typical example of second order controlled system is the restricted three - body problem @xcite where , in complex notation ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 in this case , @xmath23 is the ratio of the masses of the two primary celestial bodies , in circular motion around their common center of mass .",
    "the controlled third body is a spacecraft gravitating in the potential generated by the two primaries , but not influencing their motion .",
    "when @xmath24 , the potential is autonomous and one retrieves the standard controlled two - body problem .",
    "the study of `` continuous '' ( as opposed to impulsive ) strategies for the control began in the 60 s ; see , , the work of lawden @xcite , or beletsky s book @xcite where the importance of low thrust ( small @xmath25 in ( [ eq1.3 ] ) ) to spiral out from a given initial orbit was foreseen .",
    "there is currently a strong interest for low - thrust missions with , , the lisa pathfinder @xcite one of esa towards the @xmath26 lagrange point of the sun - earth system , or bepicolombo @xcite mission of esa and jaxa to mercury .",
    "an important issue in optimal control is the ability to verify sufficient optimality conditions . in @xmath0-minimization ,",
    "the first candidates for optimality are controls whose norm is bang - bang , switching from zero to the bound prescribed by ( [ eq1.3 ] ) ( more complicated situations including singular controls ) .",
    "second order conditions in the bang - bang case have received quite an extensive treatment ; references include the paper of sarychev @xcite , followed by @xcite and @xcite . on a similar line ,",
    "the stronger notion of state optimality was introduced in @xcite for free final time .",
    "more recently , a regularization procedure has been developed in @xcite for single - input systems .",
    "these papers consider controls valued in polyhedra ; the standing assumptions allow to define a finite dimensional accessory optimization problem in the switching times only .",
    "then , checking a second order sufficient condition on this auxiliary problem turns to be sufficient to ensure strong local optimality of the bang - bang controls .",
    "a byproduct of the analysis is that conjugate times , where local optimality is lost , are switching times .",
    "a different approach , based on hamilton - jacobi - bellman and the method of characteristics in optimal control , has been proposed by noble and schttler in @xcite .",
    "their results encompass the case of broken extremals with conjugate points occuring at _ or _ between switching times .",
    "we provide a similar analysis by requiring some generalized ( with respect to the smooth case ) disconjugacy condition on the jacobi fields , and using instead a hamiltonian point of view reminiscent of @xcite .",
    "treating the case of such broken extremals is crucial for @xmath0-minimization : as the finite dimensional norm of the control involved in the constraint ( [ eq1.3 ] ) and in the cost ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is an @xmath27-norm , the control is valued in the euclidean ball of @xmath4 , not a polyhedron if @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 , the situation is degenerate , and one can for instance set @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "( this approach also works for @xmath28 when an @xmath20 or @xmath32-norm is used for the values of the control ; see , , @xcite . )",
    "when @xmath28 , it is clear using spherical coordinates that although the norm of the control might be bang - bang , the variations of the control component on @xmath33 preclude the reduction to a finite dimensional optimization problem .",
    "( the same remark holds true for any @xmath34-norm of the control values with @xmath35 . ) an example of conjugacy occuring between switching times is provided in  [ s4 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ] , the extremal lifts of @xmath0-minimizing trajectories are studied for an arbitrary potential in the constant mass case ; the properties of the flow are encoded by the poisson structure defined by two hamiltonians . in section  [ s3 ] , sufficient conditions for strong local optimality of broken extremals with regular switching points are given in terms of jumps on the jacobi fields ; these conditions are related to the no - fold condition of @xcite . in section  [ s4 ] some numerical results illustrating the verification of these sufficient conditions for @xmath0-minimizing trajectories",
    "are given .",
    "the two - body mechanical potential is considered , completing the study of gergaud and haberkorn @xcite where the first numerical computation of fuel minimizing controls with hundreds of switchings ( for low thrust ) was performed using a clever combination of shooting and homotopy techniques .",
    "( see also @xcite in the case of a few switchings . )",
    "the classical construction of fields of extremals in the smooth case is reviewed in an appendix .",
    "by renormalizing the time and the potential , one can assume @xmath36 in ( [ eq1.3 ] ) , so we consider the @xmath0-minimum control of @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath3 an open subset of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and make the following assumptions on the boundary conditions : @xmath40 where ( i ) @xmath41 does not belong to the terminal submanifold @xmath42 , ( ii ) @xmath42 is invariant wrt .",
