    "significant advances in understanding isospin violation in the nuclear force have been made in the past decade .",
    "experimental progress ( which is reviewed and summarized in refs.@xcite ) has been supplemented recently by the advent of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite . this powerful technique casts the symmetries of qcd into effective interactions of the traditional , low - energy degrees of freedom of nuclear physics ( viz . , nucleons and pions ) .",
    "these building blocks ( in the lagrangian ) can then be combined in a systematic way to produce nuclear forces that violate isospin in exactly the same way as in qcd .",
    "an important feature of effective field theories is power counting , which is the technique used to organize calculations@xcite .",
    "a well - defined ordering of terms in the lagrangian according to scales intrinsic to qcd and nuclei is used to generate all terms of a particular size .",
    "terms in the lagrangian are labeled ( in the conventional way , @xmath2 ) by the number of implicit powers ( @xmath3 ) of the inverse of the large - mass scale of qcd , @xmath4 1 gev . when considering processes where the typical momentum is of the order of the pion mass , @xmath5 , amplitudes are expanded in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "much work has been done in the past few years regarding the derivation of the isospin - symmetric part of the nuclear potential@xcite .",
    "the components of short ( @xmath7 ) range in the potential come from ( renormalized ) contact interactions whose strengths are not determined by symmetry .",
    "the components of longer range arise from pion exchanges , and are determined in terms of pion couplings to the nucleon , which are fewer and in many cases determined from processes involving a single nucleon .",
    "perhaps the most significant result of this method is the first derivation of a two - pion - range potential consistent with the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd@xcite .",
    "this two - pion - exchange potential ( tpep ) has been incorporated in the nijmegen phase - shift analysis@xcite .",
    "pion - nucleon couplings determined from two - nucleon data were found to be in good agreement with other determinations based on pion - nucleon scattering .    in effective theories",
    ", isospin - breaking interactions can be classified@xcite according to whether their origin is the mass difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks or hard electromagnetic ( em ) interactions at the quark level .",
    "the soft em interactions ( such as the coulomb force ) can be constructed in the usual way@xcite .",
    "the power counting for isospin - violating interactions was developed by one of us@xcite , and it explains the sizes of the various isospin structures present in the nuclear force .",
    "a convenient and universal@xcite classification for nuclear isospin is : class ( i ) - isospin conserving ; class ( ii ) - charge - independence breaking ( cib ) of isospin , but charge symmetric ; class ( iii ) - charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) of isospin ; class ( iv ) - isospin mixing in the @xmath10 system between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . power counting can be used to demonstrate@xcite that a class ( n ) force appears only at order @xmath13 or higher .",
    "we therefore deduce on the basis of qcd a result that was noticed before on an empirical basis : class ( i ) forces are stronger than class ( ii ) , which are stronger than class ( iii ) , which are stronger than class ( iv ) .    using this formalism ,",
    "several of the various isospin components of the nuclear potential have been calculated@xcite . in particular , we have computed the long - range components of the class ( i)@xcite and class ( ii)@xcite two - nucleon potentials , up to order @xmath14 .",
    "the class ( iii ) isospin violation is the purview of this work .",
    "charge symmetry@xcite can be loosely defined as invariance under turning neutrons into protons and protons into neutrons .",
    "it has long been considered a particularly interesting aspect of isospin violation because the difference in quark masses is a source of csb . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant interaction that violates this symmetry is the electromagnetic interaction , which is large between two protons and very small between two neutrons .",
    "moreover , the coulomb interaction between protons is long - ranged , while it has a nuclear range for two neutrons and is therefore indistinguishable from nuclear interactions .",
    "there are corrections of order @xmath15 to the static coulomb interaction ( where @xmath16 is the nucleon mass ) , which are part of the breit interaction .",
    "although these familiar electromagnetic interactions dominate the csb in nuclei , we will largely ignore them and concentrate on the nuclear mechanisms@xcite .",
    "in the nuclear force the comparison that interests us is the difference in forces between two protons and two neutrons , which is restricted to the @xmath12 channel for two nucleons .",
    "the longstanding interest in csb@xcite has been highlighted recently by two exciting new experiments .",
    "one experiment , carried out at triumf and currently undergoing final stages of analysis , measures the front - back asymmetry of the pion produced in the reaction @xmath17 close to threshold@xcite .",
    "another experiment has just been completed at iucf , and measures the near - threshold cross section for the reaction @xmath18@xcite .",
    "it has been argued in ref.@xcite that the chiral properties of two different contributions to the nucleon - mass difference can give a relatively large effect in @xmath17 , of opposite sign to more well - known mechanisms .",
    "a similar phenomenon might exist in @xmath18@xcite .",
    "there is reason to hope that these data will allow a model - independent ( albeit crude ) determination of both quark - mass and electromagnetic components of the nucleon - mass difference .",
    "an issue that arises naturally is the role of the nucleon - mass difference in the two - pion - exchange nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "ref.@xcite calculated the crossed - box contribution , and it contains a comprehensive discussion of the older literature@xcite , where aspects of chiral symmetry are not emphasized .",
    "more recently , ref.@xcite calculated a csb seagull contribution using the formalism of ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the relative sizes of csb interactions in effective field theories , and calculate the two - nucleon potential of two - pion range that arises from the nucleon - mass difference .",
    "pieces of this potential have appeared before@xcite .",
    "here we complete the calculation of the long - range component of the class ( iii ) potential up to ( and including ) order @xmath14 .",
    "in the chiral lagrangian , the largest isospin - violating terms are those that determine the mass differences of nucleons and pions@xcite . in order to compare these and various other contributions , it is useful to estimate relative sizes of em and quark - mass effects .",
    "the pion - mass splitting provides a good starting point .",
    "the pion - mass splitting ( squared ) , @xmath19 , receives contributions from both the difference between the masses of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks and em interactions . because of the chiral transformation properties of the pion , the contribution from the quark - mass difference is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "the proportionality constant ( @xmath21 ) is on the order of the square of the difference of quark masses divided by their sum ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the pion - mass difference is therefore mostly due to em interactions .",
    "it is nominally of order @xmath23 , but the large strength implied by this counting is compensated by the small fine - structure constant ( @xmath24 ) , which reduces the strength by slightly more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the size of the pion - mass splitting is then rather accurately described by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , the mass of the @xmath27-meson@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the relevant dimensionless parameter for the em - induced isospin violation is @xmath28 , which numerically is close to @xmath29 .",
    "since the latter would ordinarily correspond in power counting to @xmath14 , we deduce a convenient mnemonic of adding 3 to the order of the em - induced isospin - violating lagrangian when comparing sizes with quark - mass - induced mechanisms .",
    "henceforth our power counting for em - induced interactions will contain this additional factor of 3 ( e.g. , @xmath30 as counted above will be counted as @xmath31 below ) .",
    "the power counting has been used in ref.@xcite to classify various contributions to the nuclear potential .",
    "the leading isospin - breaking interaction appears at @xmath31 , when the pion - mass difference is inserted in the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) .",
    "it gives a class ( ii ) force , which is of relative strength @xmath32 ( times opep)@xcite .",
    "many other class ( ii ) forces appear up to order @xmath14 .",
    "there are three em mechanisms of roughly the same relative strength , @xmath33 ( times the usual opep ) produced by @xmath14 terms in the lagrangian or from loops .",
    "they are : the two - pion - exchange potential with different charged and neutral pion masses@xcite , cib in the pion - nucleon coupling constant@xcite and consequently in opep , and the @xmath34-exchange potential@xcite . moreover , there are opep corrections that arise from higher - order isospin - conserving pion - nucleon interactions ( such as recoil in the usual pion - nucleon coupling ) , and from second - order effects due to the the pion- and nucleon - mass differences@xcite .    here",
    "we concentrate on the class ( iii ) mechanisms .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss briefly the various mechanisms that contribute to csb in the @xmath35 system and in the trinucleon system ( @xmath0he @xmath1 @xmath0h ) , their relative sizes , and their relationship in the context of power counting .",
    "the bulk of the csb is due to the soft em interactions .",
    "the 764 kev binding - energy difference of @xmath0he and @xmath0h is largely accounted for by the 648 kev coulomb energy difference@xcite plus approximately 29 kev from the small breit corrections plus vacuum polarization@xcite .",
    "calculations of these contributions appear to be rather robust , and we henceforth ignore them .",
    "the remaining mechanisms that generate approximately 87 kev are contained in chpt , and we discuss them below .",
    "the most obvious signature of csb due to nuclear forces is the difference in the scattering lengths of two neutrons and two protons , once all em mechanisms are accounted for and the effect of the different nucleon masses on the kinetic energy ( see eqn .",
    "( 1c ) below ) is treated .",
    "the resulting `` experimental '' @xmath36 scattering - length difference@xcite of @xmath371.5(5 ) fm is then attributed to csb in the nuclear force .",
    "typically one treats only the short - range ( as opposed to pion - range ) csb force , by adjusting the force to produce the desired difference in scattering lengths .",
    "this csb modification of the force then produces a contribution to the @xmath0he @xmath1 @xmath0h binding - energy difference of approximately 65(22 ) kev , a number that also appears robust@xcite and can accommodate the 87 kev binding - energy difference missing after soft em processes are taken into account .",
    "note that this scattering - length difference is generated by the total csb nuclear force , and does not differentiate between components of different ranges .",
    "the mass of a single nucleon can be expressed in terms of isospin operators ( the pauli isospin operator @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 , where @xmath40 gives + 1/2 for a proton and @xmath371/2 for a neutron ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the average nucleon mass , @xmath43 is the nucleon - mass difference , and @xmath44 is a csb nucleon - mass interaction . the nucleon - mass difference , @xmath45 , receives contributions from both the quark - mass difference , @xmath46 , and em interactions at the quark level , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( we neglect here mixed contributions of higher order . ) the piece due to the quark - mass difference is the sole csb contribution of order @xmath3=1 , implying that this quantity is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 plays an important role in the power counting for isospin violation , and would lead to a nucleon - mass difference on the order of 8 mev ( a factor of three higher than most model estimates , and therefore reasonable ) .",
    "the corresponding nucleon - mass term from em interactions at the quark level is of order @xmath51 , but is numerically comparable to the quark - mass term ( somewhat smaller and of opposite sign ) because it implicitly contains a power of the fine - structure constant .",
    "the largest csb interactions in the lagrangian thus come from the nucleon - mass difference of orders @xmath3= [ 1,2 ] for the two different mechanisms .",
    "the effects of the nucleon - mass difference on nuclear amplitudes are somewhat suppressed , however .",
    "summing eqn .",
    "( 1a ) over all nucleons produces an overall constant ( determined by the average nucleon mass ) , which can be removed by a shift in the zero of energy , and a term proportional to the @xmath52-component of the total nuclear isospin , @xmath53 .",
    "the latter term will contribute to a csb shift in the nuclear kinetic energy ( for simplicity we restrict ourselves to only two nucleons in their center - of - mass ( cm ) frame ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the usual cm kinetic energy for two nucleons with equal masses , and @xmath56 for two nucleons .",
    "the csb nucleon - mass difference will also lead to a modification of the nuclear potential energy .",
    "the csb part of eqn .",
    "( 1a ) ( @xmath57 ) will commute with an isospin - conserving hamiltonian and therefore will play no role to order @xmath45 , except inside certain loops ( viz .",
    ", crossed - box and triangle diagrams ) that involve exchanging two charged pions .",
    "in the latter case for a process initiated by two identical nucleons of one type , the intermediate state would contain two nucleons of the @xmath58 type .",
    "exchanging neutral mesons clearly does not invoke this mechanism , nor does ladder approximation ( sequential exchanges of neutral mesons ) for two protons or two neutrons . because this effect requires a loop ,",
    "it is of order @xmath14 .",
    "thus although nominally of order @xmath31 ( by itself ) , the nucleon - mass difference actually first contributes in the much higher order @xmath14 , which is a reduction in size typical of loop contributions .",
    "in addition to these loop insertions , there are associated triangle - graph interactions from seagulls ( discussed below ) .",
    "other contributions in the lagrangian begin at order @xmath59 for the quark - mass terms ( i.e. , they are the largest ) and arise from two types of csb nuclear forces : short - range forces ( such as those arising from @xmath60@xcite and @xmath61@xcite mixing ) , and from isospin violation in the pion - nucleon coupling constant ( a model for the latter is provided by @xmath62 mixing@xcite ) .",
    "we denote the former by @xmath63 and the latter by @xmath64 . to leading order@xcite for two nucleons",
    "one has @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the separation of nucleons 1 and 2 , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 have unit volume integral .",
    "the constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 stem from the quark - mass difference and are of order @xmath71 , while @xmath72 and @xmath73 are em corrections of order @xmath74 .",
    "this implies a potential strength @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the expectation value of the short - range interaction between either the @xmath77 pair in @xmath0he or the @xmath78 pair in @xmath0h .",
    "a 34-channel calculation using the av18 potential@xcite gives @xmath377.6 mev for the latter , or an estimate of about 45 kev for the contribution of the csb short - range interaction to the @xmath0he @xmath1 @xmath0h binding - energy difference .",
    "this interaction has traditionally always been a part of csb studies .",
    "the opep contains a csb ( coupling constant ) modification@xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the usual isospin - conserving opep , and we do not write ( higher - order ) recoil corrections explicitly . here",
    "@xmath81 is the ( quark - mass induced ) csb pion - nucleon coupling constant and @xmath82 is the ( em - induced ) csb pion - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "the size of @xmath83 is constrained only by an upper limit on @xmath84 , arising from the nijmegen phase - shift analysis of @xmath35 data@xcite .",
    "a numerical estimate of @xmath64 in the trinucleon system can be obtained from eqn .",
    "( 3 ) , which shows that the contribution to the trinucleon binding - energy difference is approximately @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the expectation value of the potential energy due to opep between either the @xmath77 pair in @xmath0he or the @xmath78 pair in @xmath0h . a 34-channel faddeev calculation using the av18 potential@xcite produces @xmath371.67 mev for the latter . using the experimental value of @xmath87 from ref.@xcite produces @xmath88 0(50 ) kev of uncertain sign .",
    "the dimensional estimate@xcite using @xmath89 produces @xmath88 50 kev , and also of uncertain sign .",
    "thus a substantial part of the `` short - range '' contribution to csb ( 65(22 ) kev ) in the trinucleons could come from csb in opep , rather than from a shorter - range interaction .",
    "in any event the two mechanisms are predicted by power counting to be the dominant hadronic contributions and to be roughly comparable in size .",
    "the next order in chpt for csb is @xmath14 .",
    "the modification of the nuclear kinetic energy induced by the different nucleon masses ( eqn .",
    "( 1c ) ) is of this order , and is always taken into account , both in the @xmath35 interaction and in the trinucleon csb , where it contributes a robust 14 kev@xcite .",
    "a power - counting estimate of its size can be made by using @xmath90 to estimate the average value of the nucleon momentum in the trinucleons , which produces a value @xmath91 25 kev ( and within a factor of two of the actual value ) .",
    "the size of this contribution illustrates the general caveat about power counting : even though this kinetic - energy modification is an order smaller in the lagrangian than the potential couplings ( @xmath14 vs. @xmath59 ) , they can make actual contributions in a @xmath92 that are not very different in size .",
    "this contribution added to the soft - em mechanisms discussed earlier leaves about 73 kev to be explained by the various csb nuclear potentials .",
    "the other mechanism of order @xmath14 is the two - pion - exchange csb arising from the nucleon - mass difference in certain loops , which we discussed above and will treat below .",
    "it depends not simply on the full proton - neutron mass difference , but on @xmath46 and @xmath47 separately .",
    "since these two components of the nucleon - mass difference are presently unknown , we can only estimate the impact of this potential on observable quantities .",
    "power counting suggests that this contribution is one order smaller than the ( three ) previously discussed mechanisms .",
    "we can make a numerical estimate of its contribution to the @xmath0he @xmath1 @xmath0h binding - energy difference using naive dimensional analysis . again assuming that the typical momentum in the nucleus is @xmath93 and that the loop integral gives the usual factor of @xmath94 , we expect in coordinate space @xmath95 , which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the estimate for @xmath96 of 25 kev . as we will see below , however",
    ", the loop integrals in this case only give * one * power of @xmath97 .",
    "the csb tpep then likely supplies a larger contribution than expected on the basis of power counting .",
    "note that the csb tpep contribution is also a part of the traditional `` short - range '' nuclear csb mechanism , and its effect is therefore included in the 65(22 ) kev short - range part of the trinucleon binding - energy difference .",
    "one can of course accommodate all of these short - range mechanisms using models@xcite .",
    "alternatively one can hope that a sophisticated partial - wave analysis of nucleon - nucleon scattering , such as that carried out by the nijmegen group@xcite , may be able to disentangle the csb interactions of one - pion range , two - pion range , and short range , each of which contains an unknown parameter that must be fitted to the data .",
    "incorporating these forces into their procedure should be straightforward , although there may not be enough sensitivity in the data to distinguish between the three mechanisms .",
    "a full analysis of few - nucleon systems within effective field theory@xcite will eventually include all these csb mechanisms .    in summary , there are two mechanisms for csb of order @xmath59 at the lagrangian level ( csb short - range forces in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , and csb opep in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) ) and one of order @xmath14 ( nuclear csb kinetic energy in eqn .",
    "( 1c ) ) that should make roughly comparable contributions in a nucleus .",
    "the tpep modified by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , together with the associated csb seagull interactions ( all given in eqns .",
    "( 9 ) below ) , should be somewhat smaller .",
    "isospin - conserving two - pion - exchange potentials ( tpeps ) are an old problem with a new twist . in static order ( containing only terms that remain when the nucleon mass , @xmath16 , or the large - mass scale of qcd , @xmath98 , becomes very large ) the diagrams of fig .",
