    "an important ingredient of the construction of perfect actions @xcite is inverse blocking .",
    "this method gives smooth interpolations of background lattice gauge fields on finer and finer lattices which are free of quantum fluctuations .",
    "exploring the topological structure of lattice gauge vacua ( and thermal states ) requires such an interpolation .",
    "it is well - known that some smoothing is needed just to determine the global topological charge in an unambiguous way @xcite .",
    "cooling has been proposed iteratively transforming monte carlo ( mc ) configurations into smoother ones by _ unconstrained relaxation _ w.r.t . to some action . due to the diffusive character of cooling it is hard to predict after how many iterations cooled fields exhibit structures characteristic for the quantum ensemble at a definite scale .",
    "a random walk estimate asserts that @xmath1 cooling iterations will keep structures intact at distance @xmath2 . relying on this",
    ", cooling is used _",
    "e. g. _ to measure the connected field strength correlator at intermediate distances @xcite .",
    "there are attempts to improve cooling by use of improved actions @xcite ( measuring with improved topological density ) including extended wilson loops .",
    "this can protect instantons at a scale of a few lattice spacing , but still instanton - antiinstanton pairs annihilate at some stage of improved cooling .",
    "inverse blocking captures topological structure near to the scale of the original lattice spacing by a strictly local procedure .",
    "thus , perfect actions prove their _ diagnostic power _ based on the renormalization group .",
    "degrand et al.@xcite demonstrated that one step of inverse blocking suffices to define a perfect total topological charge even if one deals with instantons with @xmath3 not bigger than the lattice spacing .",
    "this result has inspired us to examine further the capability of inverse blocking .",
    "our aim was to detect more details of topological structure in terms of _ topological charge density and monopole currents _ and to study how they change at the deconfining transition @xcite .",
    "we have used a truncated fixed point action with plaquettes and tilted @xmath4-dimensional @xmath5-link loops in various representations @xcite @xmath6 the lattice size was @xmath7 and @xmath8 where simulations have been carried out at @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this interval encloses @xmath14 @xcite where the deconfinement transition happens for @xmath8 .",
    "our finite temperature results presented below are based on @xmath15 mc ( unsmoothed ) configurations and @xmath16 smoothed ones per @xmath17 value .    given a coarse configuration with links @xmath18 , inverse blocking gives the _ constrained minimum _ of the fixed point action as a configuration @xmath19 on the next finer lattice .",
    "the constraint is formulated including a blocking kernel @xmath20 into the full action functional to be minimized @xmath21 classical perfectness requires saturation @xmath22 we found this saturation to be fulfilled for equilibrium configurations with an accuracy of a few percent ( depending on @xmath17 ) using an effective @xmath23 .",
    "we convinced ourselves that the physical results to be presented do not very much depend on this parameter .    with a perfect action it should not matter at which level the mc code is actually running .",
    "we have simulated on the fine lattice creating links @xmath19 , blocked them to coarse lattice links @xmath18 . keeping @xmath18 fixed , by inverse blocking ( ib ) we obtained @xmath24 , the smoothest interpolation to @xmath18 . although the final analysis is done on the fine lattice , structures that are resolved belong to the coarse lattice .",
    "being of non  perturbative , long range origin , a confining potential should survive the smoothing step as far as no structures below the coarse level contribute to the string tension .",
    "contrary to this , big changes of topological and monopole densities are expected since quantum fluctuations and dislocations ( otherwise counted on the fine lattice ) are washed out by smoothing .",
    "for calibration of the finite temperature lattices for the set of @xmath17 values we have measured the zero temperature string tension on a symmetric lattice @xmath25 . we have considered temporal , spatially fuzzy wilson loops and extracted the string tension from fits to the potential energy .",
    "we have found a window of approximate scaling around @xmath26 .",
    "the two  loop expression for @xmath27 has been used , giving @xmath28 from data for @xmath29 ( see table [ tab : loop_string_tens ] ) .",
    ".__string tension @xmath28 at @xmath30 from fuzzy wilson loops on a @xmath25 lattice _ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : z_faktor_scatter ] shows a corresponding scatter plot . from the slope",
    "we can extract a renormalization factor @xmath31 of the naive charge for smoothed configurations , @xmath32 . in the neighbourhood of the phase transition we obtained @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath11 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "susceptibility data for mc and smoothed configurations ( still without renormalization of the naive topological charge ) are given in table [ tab : suscept ] .",
    "@xmath38 ( based on lscher s geometric charge ) is reduced by smoothing by one to two orders of magnitude ( going from confinement to deconfinement ) .",
    "this means that the fixed point action does not sufficiently suppress topological dislocations .",
    "they are smoothed away by blocking and inverse blocking .",
    "this is in accordance to the observation @xcite that a sensible measurement of topological charge ( even a geometrical one ) requires interpolation by inverse blocking .",
    "the naive topological density has a _ perturbative _",
    "@xmath39 for @xmath0 wilson action in the relevant @xmath17 range . also with the fixed point action used for production of mc configurations , the naive topological susceptibility @xmath40 ( without proper renormalization ) is two orders of magnitude lower than @xmath38 defined through ( integer valued ) charges if calculated for mc configurations . after smoothing , however ,",
    "the susceptibilities @xmath40 and @xmath38 do not differ by more than @xmath41 per cent .",
    "this difference can be accounted for by the effective renormalization factor defined above for smoothed configurations .",
    "a unique @xmath42 emerges whose @xmath17-dependence is turned into @xmath43-dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : suscept_ib ] . for definiteness",
    ", the lattice spacing has been expressed through the zero temperature string tension measured for each @xmath17 , respectively , on the symmetric lattice . to normalize",
    "we can assume a string tension @xmath44 and obtain a susceptibility @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "a non - trivial two - point correlator of topological density is difficult to obtain without smoothing . for mc configurations it vanishes at",
    "non  zero distance ( apart from a negative kinematical signal at @xmath47 ) . for smoothed configurations",
    ", however , the correlator can be described by folding the instanton profile according to a dilute gas picture .",
    "an  instanton radius ",
    "@xmath3 can be formally defined in this way .",
    "this interpretation should be taken with care . in confinement , _ this _ @xmath48 is found independent of @xmath17 , near to the lowest instanton size detectable by inverse blocking , somewhat smaller than the lattice spacing of the blocked lattice . in deconfinement , @xmath48 becomes even smaller with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "instanton models @xcite use statistical mechanics arguments to relate the density of instantons and antiinstantons to vacuum energy and topological susceptibility by low energy theorems ( as well as to make predictions on the multiplicity distribution ) .",
    "assumptions on instanton interactions enter into these models which can be checked measuring the average density of instantons _ independently _ from the topological susceptibility .",
    "a first attempt was to compare @xmath49 defined above ( this makes sense only for smoothed configurations ) with @xmath42 .",
    "over the temperature range considered @xmath49 decreases , but less rapid than @xmath42 ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qsqdurcha ] ) .",
    "the horizontal line is a bound set by          the crucial factor @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the one  loop coefficient in the @xmath17-function ) appears also in the instanton liquid equation of state @xmath53 , the width of the multiplicity distribution @xmath54 ( compressibility smaller than poisson ) and in the entropic bound @xmath55 ( for carriers of charge @xmath56 ) banning dislocations . interactions leading to a @xmath57 suppression of the topological susceptibility compared to the densities @xmath58 have been discussed @xcite in the earliest days of the instanton liquid model .",
    "in fact , @xmath49 is only an upper bound for @xmath59 .",
    "further illumination is expected from a cluster analysis of smoothed configurations .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smooth_luescher ] .",
    "but there come surprises : clusters do not look like classical instantons .",
    "the size can not estimated from the maximum of @xmath60 .",
    "if isolated charges are removed by few cooling steps , the cluster charges are centered around @xmath61 .",
    "although the mean multiplicity of clusters drops drastically at @xmath62 , the variance follows poisson s law at all temperatures across the transition .",
    "we hope to clarify further the nature of the topological composition of the @xmath0 vacuum in ongoing work .",
