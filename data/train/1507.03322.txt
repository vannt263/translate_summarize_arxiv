    "inspired by the developments of distributed consensus control for classical network systems in the past decade @xcite , consensus and synchronization problems of quantum networks have also recently attracted attention in the research community @xcite .",
    "et al . _ @xcite generalized consensus algorithms to non - commutative spaces and presented convergence results for quantum stochastic maps , and showed how the birkhoff theorem can be used to analyze the asymptotic convergence of a quantum system to a fully mixed state .",
    "_ @xcite made a systematic study regarding consensus - seeking in quantum networks , introducing several classes of consensus quantum states and a quantum generalization to the gossip iteration algorithm based on pairwise swapping operators for reaching a symmetric state ( consensus ) over a quantum network .",
    "the class of quantum gossip algorithms was further extended to symmetrization problems in a group - theoretic framework @xcite .",
    "the analysis of quantum consensus seeking was further developed using the graphical methods for studying classical network systems @xcite , and it was shown that the vectorized density operator evolving along quantum consensus dynamics is equivalent to a number of parallel classical consensus dynamics over disjoint subgraphs @xcite , which enabled us to study quantum consensus dynamics via their classical analogous with all details inherited . furthermore , when the network hamiltonian is commutative with the swapping operators , one can derive a so - called quantum synchronization master equation @xcite as the quantum counter part of the classical linear synchronization results @xcite .",
    "this quantum synchronization master equation can be physically realized via quantum dissipation networks where quantum nodes are interconnected by local environments @xcite .",
    "it however has been understood that when a quantum system interacts with the environment through dissipative couplings , the quantum information encoded in the system is often washed out in the sense that the off - diagonal entries of the system density operator asymptotically vanish .",
    "this phenomenon is known as decoherence . in this paper",
    ", we study the decoherence property of synchronization master equation for quantum networks of qubits interconnected by swapping operators .",
    "the network hamiltonian is assumed to be diagonal but with different diagonal entries so it might not be commutative with the swapping operators .",
    "we prove a theorem establishing a general condition under which almost complete decohernece is achieved , i.e. , all but two of the off - diagonal entries of the network density operator asymptotically tend to zero .",
    "this result explicitly shows that quantum dissipation networks tend to forget the information initially encoded when the internal and external qubit interactions , respectively induced by the network hamiltonian and the swapping operators , do not comply with each other .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] introduces the problem definition and presents the main result obtained . a brief introduction to the quantum mechanics related to the developments of the current paper",

    "a quantum interaction graph over the @xmath36-qubit network is an undirected , connected graph @xmath44 , where each element in @xmath45 , called a quantum edge , is an unordered pair of two distinct qubits denoted as @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
