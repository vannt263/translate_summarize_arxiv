    "excitable media play vital roles in various systems @xcite .",
    "excitable media in biological tissues support the propagation of signals , such as concentration waves in the heart and electrical impulses in nerve axons .",
    "such waves are also used for communication between certain microorganisms ( _ dictyostelium discoideum _ ) .    moreover ,",
    "excitable media exhibit a particular type of spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics , in which spiral waves spontaneously generate or annihilate ( spiral chaos ) @xcite .",
    "spiral chaos is commonly observed in surface reaction systems @xcite .",
    "similar chaotic dynamics are also observed in the heart , causing fibrillation @xcite . so far , several mathematical models for excitable media that exhibit spiral chaos have been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is also known that spiral chaos may develop in oscillatory media , e.g. , those obeying the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) @xcite . in such mathematical models , depending on the parameter values , spiral chaos permanently persists or spontaneously terminates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral_chaos ] ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the system eventually arrives at a steady state after a transient time , which we refer to as a lifetime .",
    "the dependence of the lifetime of spiral chaos on the system size has received much attention in the context of the clinical treatment of cardiac fibrillation ( @xcite and the references therein ) . in @xcite , it is numerically demonstrated using both a variant of fitzhugh  nagumo model ( referred to as the br model @xcite ) and a more realistic model for cardiac electrical dynamics that the lifetime increases exponentially with the system size .",
    "such an exponential dependence , as well as hyperexponential dependences , had already been reported in other types of transient chaos @xcite .",
    "the main focus of the present study is an expression for the dependence of the lifetime of spiral chaos in excitable media on the system size . for this goal",
    ", we first investigate statistical properties regarding the number of spiral cores ( namely , defects ) .",
    "there is a large body of studies on such statistical properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is known that as system size increases , the probability distribution of the number of defects during transient spiral chaos approaches a gaussian distribution @xcite , as is naturally expected from the central limit theorem .",
    "using this fact , we derive an expression for the system size dependence of the lifetime , which is indeed exponential .",
    "we extensively investigate the system size dependence of the lifetime using two different models , the br model and the cgle , with several parameter sets and different boundary conditions .",
    "we find that while the lifetime increases exponentially with system size in all cases , our expression fits well for parameter sets near the onset of transient chaos , suggesting that some assumptions may be violated depending on parameter values .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the model and the numerical settings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : distribution ] , we show that the probability distribution of the number of defects approaches a gaussian distribution as the system size increases . in sec .  [",
    "sec : lifetime ] , we first numerically show that the lifetime of transient spiral chaos increases exponentially with system size ; then , we derive the expression for the system size dependence of the lifetime , which fits well to numerical data for some parameter sets .",
    "a summary and discussion are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "for most of our numerical investigation , we employ the br model @xcite , which is a modified fitzhugh  nagumo model representing an excitable medium .",
    "this model has also been employed in @xcite .",
    "the model gives    [ baer_model ] @xmath0    where the parameters @xmath1 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 are positive .",
    "the system is two dimensional with an area @xmath3 .",
    "the variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 are interpreted in the context of cell physiology as the membrane potential and the recovery variable , respectively @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are performed using the fourth - order runge ",
    "kutta method with space step @xmath6 and time step @xmath7 .",
    "we first note that in eq .  , the uniform steady state @xmath8 is linearly stable for any set of parameter values . by inserting the ansatz @xmath9 with @xmath10 and a wave vector @xmath11 of perturbation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath12 , which is always negative .",
    "hence , the system should smoothly arrive at the uniform steady state if the initial state is close to it .",
    "however , for appropriate parameter values and initial conditions , spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics arise ( referred to as spiral chaos ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral_chaos ] ) . as reported in @xcite",
    ", for a broad range of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the following behavior arises . for small @xmath15 values ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "spiral waves rigidly rotate . for @xmath17 ,",
    "spiral waves begin to meander . for @xmath18 ,",
    "spiral chaos arises . in this region , spirals begin to break up after some transient rotations , resulting in the formation of two free ends of a wave . from these free ends ,",
    "a new pair of counter - rotating spirals arise .",
    "there is also a pair - annihilation process , in which the cores of a pair of counter - rotating spirals collide and annihilate .",
    "moreover , in the neumann boundary condition , there is an additional case in which a defect is absorbed by the boundary .",
    "these processes are repeated chaotically .    as a convenient initial condition for realizing this chaotic state",
    ", we employ a flat broken wave ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral_chaos ] ) , in which there initially exists a defect for the neumann boundary condition or a pair of defects for the periodic boundary condition . to obtain statistically independent results for each run of the simulations ,",
    "we add independent random noise obeying a uniform probability distribution over @xmath19 $ ] with @xmath20 to @xmath21 and @xmath22 at all discretized points at @xmath23 .",
    "note that the evolution is noise free for @xmath24 . in our preliminary numerical simulations",

    "the results presented assume the periodic boundary condition and @xmath26 unless otherwise noted .",
    "some results are obtained with the neumann boundary condition and/or other sets of @xmath13 and @xmath15 values .    to check the generality of our argument",
    ", we also numerically investigate the oscillatory media described by the complex ginzburg  landau equation ( cgle ) , given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the state variable and @xmath29 are the parameters of this system @xcite .",

    "we first investigate the time evolution and probability distribution of the number of defects .",
    "all the results in this section are for periodic boundary condition .",
    "we confirmed that qualitatively the same results were obtained with the neumann boundary condition .",
    "the number @xmath32 of defects at time @xmath33 in the system was counted as follows .",
    "the phase @xmath34 of the state is defined by @xmath35 $ ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the br model and the cgle , respectively .",
    "the topological charge @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "the defects with @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cores of counterclockwise and clockwise spirals , respectively .",
    "the topological charge is numerically obtained by calculating @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the space step employed in our numerical simulations .",
    "we then reset @xmath50 when a numerically obtained @xmath51 value is in @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "the number @xmath32 of defects is the sum of @xmath54 over the entire system .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : time series of number of defects ] , @xmath32 fluctuates strongly with time , and this chaotic process appears to be stationary .",
    "however , defects completely vanish at a certain time without any clear presage , and the system falls into the uniform steady state . as is the case in figs .",
    "[ fig : time series of number of defects ] ( a ) and ( b ) , a larger system typically has a larger number of defects and a longer transient time .",
    "statistical properties are investigated with the time series of @xmath32 during transient chaos after the initial transient process ( @xmath55 ) ( figs .  [",
    "fig : mean ] and [ fig : distribution ] ) . here for each system size , we employ many different initial conditions and the number of defects is counted at each time step until the system arrives at the steady state .",
    "we find that both the mean @xmath56 and variance @xmath57 of @xmath32 are approximately proportional to the system size @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mean ] ) : @xmath59 the linear growth of @xmath56 has also been found in @xcite .",
    "next , we measure the probability distribution of the number of defects , which is the probability that there are @xmath60 defects at each time in the system during transient chaos .",
    "as is found in @xcite , we confirm that the probability distribution approaches the following gaussian distribution as the system size increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ) : @xmath61\\\\    & = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi{\\beta}n}}\\exp     \\left [ -\\frac{(m-\\alpha n)^2}{2{\\beta}n } \\right ] ,    \\label{gaussian }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 for the neumann boundary condition and @xmath63 for the periodic boundary condition because @xmath60 takes only even number values in the latter case .",
    "these results can be rationalized by the following argument .",
    "suppose that the system is virtually divided into @xmath64 subsystems of size @xmath65 .",
    "for the periodic boundary condition , all the subsystems should share a certain probability distribution of the number of defects with mean @xmath66 and variance @xmath67 .",
    "if the linear length @xmath68 of each subsystem is sufficiently larger than the correlation length of the system , these subsystems are approximately independent . in our case ,",
    "the correlation length is roughly @xmath69 or smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] ) .",
    "the number of defects @xmath60 in the entire system is the sum of defects of independent subsystems .",
    "the mean and variance of @xmath60 are then proportional to the system size . moreover , as stated by the central limit theorem , @xmath60 will obey the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath70 and variance @xmath71 where @xmath72 when @xmath64 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is also approximately the case for the neumann boundary condition when @xmath73 is sufficiently larger than the correlation length .    because this argument is very general",
    ", the gaussian distribution should be obtained for both the periodic and neumann boundary conditions and other models exhibiting spiral chaos when @xmath58 is sufficiently large .",

    ", it should be noted that there is still a chance that a pair of defects is generated even from the state with @xmath90 because of some remaining complex pattern . for an example of defect regeneration . ]",
    "therefore , the transition between the states with different numbers of defects @xmath60 can be illustrated as in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] , where the periodic boundary condition is assumed for simplicity so that @xmath60 takes only even numbers , and the symbol s denotes the uniform steady state .    to define the lifetime , we regard the system state as the steady state when the duration of the state with @xmath90 continues for 100 simulation time , as defects hardly reemerge if the state with @xmath90 continues for 20 simulation times ( fig .",

    "therefore , the expected lifetime for a given system size @xmath58 is @xmath102 for large @xmath58 , the probability distribution of the number of defects is well approximated by eq .   and",
    "the mean number @xmath103 of defects is large . for @xmath104",
    ", we approximately have @xmath105 plugging this into @xmath99 in eq .   and",
    "further assuming that @xmath100 is independent of @xmath58 , we finally obtain @xmath106 this expression indicates that the lifetime depends exponentially on the system size @xmath58 and its exponent is associated with the density @xmath107 and the magnitude @xmath108 of the fluctuation of the number of defects . for the neumann boundary condition , the steady state can be reached not only from the states with @xmath101 by annihilation but also from the states with @xmath109 through the absorption of a defect by the boundary .",
