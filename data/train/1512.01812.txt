    "a signal can be transformed from one domain into another in various ways . some signals that cover the whole considered interval in one domain ( where signals are dense in that domain )",
    "could be located within much smaller regions in another domain .",
    "we say that signals are sparse in a transformation domain if the number of nonzero coefficients is much smaller that the total number of signal samples .",

    "are studied in @xcite and used in @xcite to define a reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the input noise influence is also an important topic in this analysis since the reduced number of available samples could increase the sensitivity of the recovery results to this noise @xcite .",
    "additive noise will remain in the resulting transform .",

    "it takes into account very important fact that if all samples are available then the error will be zero , for both sparse and nonsparse recovered signals .",
