    "open - cell metal foams are produced either by vapor- ( or electro- ) deposition of metal on an open - cell polymer template , followed by polymer burn - off , and a final sintering step to densify the ligaments .",
    "alternatively , they are obtained by infiltration / casting of molten metal into a solid mould , consisting of packed ( non - permeable ) templates of the pores , followed by burn - out and removal of the mould @xcite .",
    "both processes result into highly gas - permeable _ reticulated _ foams , where only a 3d web of solid conducting struts among the pores survives .",

    "these two parameters determine the material s gas - permeability , and , together with the electrical properties of the metal matrix , its electrical properties .",
    "metal foams have interesting structural properties ( low density and weight , high ( tensile and shear)-strength / weight ratio , nearly isotropic load response , low coefficient of thermal expansion ) , as summarized in table i , which qualified them among the most interesting new materials for aerospace applications .

    "+ in the limit where bubbles and metal struts are much smaller than the smallest wavelength of interest , the dc conductivity of a metal foam can be computed using effective medium theory ( emt ) , for which several formulations exist ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite for a review ) .",
    "these include : i ) the `` infinite dilution '' approximation , where inclusions do not interact , and are subject to the field which would exist in the homogeneous host ; ii ) the self - consistent approach @xcite , credited to bruggemann , where inclusions are thought of as being embedded in the ( yet to be modeled ) effective medium ; iii ) the differential scheme , whereby inhomogeneities are _ incrementally _ added to the composite , because at each step new inclusions may be placed where old inclusions have already been set . ] , until the final concentration is reached , so that at each step the inclusions do not interact , and do not modify the field computed at the previous step @xcite ; iv ) the effective - field methods , whereby interaction among the inclusions is described in terms of an effective field acting on each particle , accounting for the presence of the others .",
