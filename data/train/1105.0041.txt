    "hadronic transitions among the charmonium and bottomonium states @xmath7 and @xmath8 are of particular interesting for studying the dynamics of both the heavy quarkonia and the light mesons .",
    "such processes are usually calculated with the multipole expansion in qcd , where the heavy quarkonia are considered as the compact and nonrelativistic objects and emit soft gluons which hadronize into the light meson or light meson pair @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes can be factorized into the heavy quarkonium part and the light meson part .",
    "the former part depends on the dynamics of the quarkonium and should preserve the heavy quark symmetry , while the latter part depends on the chiral dynamics and should obey the chiral symmetry @xcite .    in ref.@xcite , mannel and urech",

    "recently , the cleo collaboration searched for the decay @xmath19 in a sample of 25.9 million @xmath3 events collected with the cleo - c detector , and observed no evidence for the decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and set the upper limit , @xmath22 at the @xmath23 confidence level @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to make predictions for the decay width and differential decay width of the process @xmath1 , which may be observed at the besiii and @xmath24 in the future @xcite .    in this article , we study the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a phenomenological lagrangian by taking into account the chiral symmetry breaking effects , the final - state interactions and the heavy quark symmetry @xcite .    the article is arranged as follows : we study the @xmath10 transitions of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 in details based on the heavy quark symmetry in sec.2 ; in sec.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sec.4 is reserved for our conclusions .",
