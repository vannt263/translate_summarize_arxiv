    "an interesting combinatorial structure , called staircase tableaux , was introduced in recent work of corteel and williams @xcite .",
    "staircase tableaux are related to the asymmetric exclusion process on an one - dimensional lattice with open boundaries , the asep .",
    "this is an important and heavily studied particle model in statistical mechanics ( we refer to @xcite for some background information on several versions of that model and their applications and connections to other branches of science ) .",
    "the study of the generating function of the staircase tableau has given a combinatorial formula for the steady state probability of the asep .",
    "explicit expressions for the steady state probabilities were first given in @xcite . in their work @xcite corteel and williams used staircase tableaux to give a combinatorial formula for the moments of the ( weight function of the ) askey - wilson polynomials ; for a follow  up work see @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite called for further investigation of the staircase tableaux because of their combinatorial interest and their potential connection to geometry . in this paper",
    "we take up that issue and study some basic properties of staircase tableaux .",
    "more precisely , we analyze the distribution of various parameters associated with appearances of greek letters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in randomly chosen staircase tableau of size @xmath4 ( see the next section or , e.g. ( * ? ? ? * section  2 ) , for the definitions and the meaning of these symbols ) .    staircase tableaux are generalizations of permutation tableaux ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein for more information on these objects and their connection to a version of asep referred to as the partially asymmetric exclusion process ; pasep ) .",
    "for permutation tableaux , the authors of @xcite developed a probabilistic approach that later allowed the derivation of the limiting ( and even exact ) distributions of various parameters of the permutation tableaux .",
    "our goal here is the same : in section  [ setup ] we develop a probabilistic approach parallel to that of @xcite that allows us to compute generating functions of various quantities associated with staircase tableaux ( see corollary  [ cor : gfr ] in section  [ count ] and proposition  [ prop : gfr ] in subsection  [ subsec : euler ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the exact or limiting distributions of the parameters we study .",
    "our main results are gathered in section  [ sec : mainres ] and may be summarized by stating that the five parameters we consider have asymptotically normal distribution when normalized in a usual way ( i.e. centered by the mean and scaled by the square root of the variance ) .",
    "thus , for example , theorem  [ thm : diag ] asserts that the number @xmath5 of @xmath6 or @xmath7 on the diagonal of a randomly chosen staircase tableau of size @xmath4 has expected value @xmath8 , variance @xmath9 and that @xmath10 converges in distribution to the standard normal random variable .",
    "we refer to theorems  [ thm : ent ] and  [ thm : diag ] for precise statements .    in section  [ proofs ] below ( see comments at the beginning of subsection  [ subsec : euler ] and a remark at the end of it ) we find that one of the parameters we study coincides with a generalization of eulerian numbers ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sequence a060187 ) ) related to whitney numbers of dowling lattices ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sequences a145901 , a039775 ) and @xcite for definitions and further information on these numbers ) .",
    "this rather unexpected and intriguing connection has not been explained and merits , perhaps , further studies .",
    "one consequence of our work is that the triangle of numbers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sequence a060187 ) , when suitably normalized , satisfies the central limit theorem .",
    "as far as we can tell this result is new ( although it is an easy consequence of a general theorem of bender @xcite ) .",
    "limit theorems for a related sequence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a145901 ) are established in @xcite .",
    "this link to the whitney numbers of dowling lattices may have unraveled connection to geometry alluded to in @xcite as the sequences a060187 , a145901 , and a039775 from @xcite all have a very strong geometrical flavor .",
    "we recall the following concept first introduced in @xcite : a _ staircase tableau of size @xmath4 _ is a young diagram of shape @xmath11 whose boxes are filled according to the following rules :    * each box is either empty or contains one of the letters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 ; * no box on the diagonal is empty ; * all boxes in the same row and to the left of a @xmath1 or a @xmath2 are empty ; * all boxes in the same column and above an @xmath0 or a @xmath3 are empty .",
    "an example of a staircase tableau is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : tab](a ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     * 2 . *",
    "if @xmath12 we count the number of extensions as follows ( see figure  [ fig : tab_ext ] for an illustration ) : we can either put one of the symbols @xmath13 in the bottom corner ( and then we are forced to leave all other boxes in that column empty ) , or we can put a @xmath14 in the bottom box of the new column . in the latter case , we need to fill the @xmath15 boxes in the new column corresponding to the @xmath13 rows of @xmath16 . according to the rules ,",
    "if we put an @xmath13 in any of them , then we need to leave all boxes above it empty , otherwise we have a complete freedom .",
    "it follows from these considerations that any tableau of size @xmath4 with @xmath15 @xmath13 rows gives @xmath17 different staircase tableaux of size @xmath4 . indeed , if @xmath18 then there are 4 extensions and if @xmath12 then there are @xmath19 extensions . here",
    ", the first 2 is from putting an @xmath13 in the bottom box of the new column , the next 2 is from putting a @xmath14 in that box , the term @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is from putting the first @xmath13 in a box of the new column corresponding to the @xmath22th ( counting from bottom ) @xmath13 row of @xmath16 as then there are @xmath23 ways of filling the earlier @xmath24 boxes with symbols @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or leaving them empty , and finally , the @xmath25 term comes from not putting an @xmath13 in any of the @xmath15 boxes and thus filling them with @xmath14 s or leaving them empty .    summing the above gives @xmath26 as claimed .    as the next step",
    "we find the conditional distribution of the number of @xmath27 rows over the extensions of a given tableau of size @xmath28 . to do that we phrase the preceding discussion in a more probabilistic language using what shiryaev ( * ?",
    "* chapter  i ,  8 ) refers to as decompositions   ( which is just a special case of conditioning with respect to @xmath29algebra ) .",
    "note that every tableau from @xmath30 is an extension of a unique tableau @xmath16 from @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , denoting by @xmath32 the set of all tableaux from @xmath30 which are obtained from @xmath16 by the process described above ( as we just discussed , there are @xmath33 such tableaux ) , we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 are pairwise disjoint , non  empty subsets of @xmath36 .",
    "we denote this decomposition of @xmath30 by @xmath37 .",
    "we wish to compute the conditional probabilities @xmath38 and the conditional expectations @xmath39 with respect to this decomposition .",
    "we have    [ lem : condist ] let @xmath40 be a tableau with @xmath41 @xmath13 rows and let @xmath42 be the number of such rows in any of its extensions to a tableau of size @xmath4 . then @xmath43 and , for @xmath44 @xmath45    let @xmath16 and @xmath42 be as in the statement",
    ". clearly , the possible values for @xmath42 are @xmath46 and we need to know the probability of each of these possibilities .",
    "first , @xmath47 means that we must have placed an @xmath27 in the bottom box of the new column since this is the only way we can increase the number of @xmath27 rows .",
    "consequently , all other boxes in the new column are to remain empty .",
    "obviously there are two such extensions which in view of lemma  [ lem : condist ] gives @xmath48 which justifies .",
    "next , for @xmath44 we compute @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath50 is the number of @xmath14 s that we put in the @xmath15 allowable ( i.e. corresponding to @xmath13 rows of @xmath16 ) boxes , @xmath51 means that we put a @xmath14 in the bottom box and additional @xmath50 @xmath14 s in the @xmath15 allowable boxes above it .",
    "if we do not put an @xmath13 in any of those @xmath50 boxes , we have @xmath52 possibilities ( 2 is for putting either a @xmath1 or a @xmath2 at the bottom , and the rest accounts for putting @xmath14 s in any @xmath50 of the allowable @xmath15 boxes ) .",
    "if we do put an @xmath13 in one of the boxes we need to pick @xmath53 of the allowable @xmath15 boxes , put an @xmath13 in the topmost of them and put @xmath14 s in the remaining @xmath50 of them ( and at the bottom ) .",
    "this gives @xmath54 possibilities .",
    "adding up the two pieces and dividing by the total number of extensions given in lemma  [ lem : condist ] we obtain , @xmath55 as required .",
    "lemma  [ lem : condist ] completely describes the conditional distribution of @xmath56 given @xmath37 and leads , in particular , to the following basic relation :    [ lem : gf_r ] for a complex number @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( with the understanding that @xmath59 ) @xmath60    recall that as we extend a tableau with @xmath15 @xmath13 rows , we have @xmath61 if and only if we put an @xmath13 at the bottom of the new column and @xmath62 if and only if we put a @xmath14 there and additional @xmath50 @xmath14 s in the @xmath15 boxes above it . therefore , letting @xmath63 denote the event that we put the symbol * at the bottom of the new column we have @xmath64 the last term is @xmath65 so that we obtain @xmath66 this proves .",
    "as we already mentioned , lemma  [ lem : gf_r ] ( or its versions ) plays a crucial role in our approach .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the second ingredient , namely the change of measure .",
    "it it is necessitated by the fact that there are two different probability measures on @xmath67 that naturally appear in our considerations .",
    "the first is , of course , the uniform measure @xmath68 .",
    "we discuss the second one and the relation between them below .",
    "consider @xmath67 , the set of all staircase tableaux of size @xmath28 .",
    "the second probability measure on @xmath67 is obtained from the uniform probability measure on @xmath69 by `` collapsing '' all the elements of @xmath69 that are extensions of the same element @xmath70 .",
    "more formally , consider a map @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 if and only if @xmath73 is an extension of @xmath16 .",
    "the measure of interest is the image of @xmath74 under @xmath75 .",
    "we denote this measure @xmath76 ( there is an apparent ambiguity of notation here , however , it disappears once we remember whether @xmath16 is in @xmath36 or @xmath67 ) . since both of these measures appear in the course of our argument , it is important to find the relationship between them .",
    "but this is straightforward : since a tableau @xmath40 with @xmath15 @xmath13 rows gives @xmath77 tableaux in @xmath78 we have @xmath79 consequently , for any random variable @xmath80 on @xmath31 we have @xmath81 here we have used the same convention as above ; for a random variable @xmath82 on @xmath67 , @xmath83 denotes the expectation with respect to the uniform measure on @xmath67 while @xmath84 denotes the expectation with respect to the measure that is induced on @xmath67 by the uniform measure on @xmath36 .",
    "the relations and are key and will allow us to analyze the distributions of the various statistics on @xmath36 .",
    "note that and are true regardless of whether we know the cardinalities of @xmath67 and @xmath36 or not . as a matter of fact , one can use to provide a yet another argument that @xmath85 as we will see in the next section .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how we intend to apply and to derive recurrences for generating functions that upon solving yield information on the corresponding statistics .",
    "we focus here on the number of @xmath13 rows which , on one hand is the easiest to analyse , and on the other is central in the analysis of other statistics .",
    "[ prop : gfr ] for every complex number @xmath57 we have @xmath86    by the basic properties of the conditional expectation ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * formula  ( 16 ) , p.  79 ) ) the expectation on the right  hand side is equal to @xmath87 . using first and then we further get @xmath88 applying the same procedure with @xmath57 replaced by @xmath89 and @xmath4 by @xmath28 we obtain @xmath90 further iteration yields @xmath91 since @xmath92 and @xmath93 the above can be written as @xmath94 which is precisely .    proposition  4 has a number of consequences .",
    "first , by putting @xmath95 in we obtain an independent confirmation of the count of staircase tableau of a given size .    [ cor : count ]",
    "let @xmath36 be the set of all staircase tableaux of size @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath96    note that once this corollary is known and simplify to @xmath97 respectively , and this is the form we will be using from now on .",
    "next , by combining this corollary with we obtain    [ cor : gfr ] the probability generating function of the number of @xmath27 rows in a random staircase tableau of size @xmath4 is given by @xmath98    the last corollary gives , in turn , a complete information on the distribution of @xmath56 .    [ cor : arows_dist ] for every @xmath58 we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 s are independent and @xmath100 is a random variable which is 1 with probability @xmath101 and 0 with the remaining probability . in particular , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are harmonic numbers of the first and second order , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath105    note that a factor @xmath106 given in the previous corollary is the probability generating function of a random variable @xmath100 which is 1 with probability @xmath101 and 0 with the remaining probability . since the product of the probability generating functions corresponds to adding independent random variables , we obtain and thus also .",
    "finally , since @xmath100 are uniformly bounded and variances of their partial sums go to infinity , the lindeberg condition for the central limit theorem ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  iii   4 ) ) holds trivially . since as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , holds",
    "our technique allows us to obtain further results concerning the distributions ( sometimes exact , sometimes only asymptotic ) of the statistics discussed above .",
    "we gather our results in the following two statements , concerning the total number of entries and the number of entries on the diagonal , respectively . recall that @xmath109 and @xmath110 denote the total number of @xmath111 and @xmath27 in the tableau of size @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "[ thm : ent ] consider the set @xmath30 with the uniform probability measure @xmath74 . then :    * for every @xmath58 we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 are independent and @xmath114 , @xmath115 . in particular , @xmath116 and , as @xmath107 , @xmath117 * for every @xmath58 @xmath118 in particular , , , and hold with @xmath119 replaced by @xmath120 .",
    "our second result concerns the entries on the diagonal . recall that @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath121 ) denote the number of @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath111 ) on the diagonal of a tableau of size @xmath4 . for these parameters",
    "we get    [ thm : diag ] the expected value and the variance of the number @xmath5 of @xmath13 on the diagonal of a random staircase tableau of size @xmath4 are , respectively , @xmath122 moreover , @xmath123 furthermore , for every @xmath58 we have @xmath124 in particular , and hold for @xmath121 in place of @xmath5 .    *",
    "remark : * while it seems intuitively clear that the expected number of letters @xmath27 on the diagonal is @xmath8 as asserts , the expression for the variance is much less intuitive",
    ". it implies , in particular , that the entries @xmath27 and @xmath111 along the diagonal are not chosen independently from one another with equal probabilities as one might have hoped ( if that were the case the variance would be @xmath125 ) .",
    "we begin by observing that , as is obvious from the definition , staircase tableaux are symmetric under taking the transpose and exchanging the @xmath6 s with the @xmath126 s and the @xmath7 s with the @xmath2 s .",
    "it therefore is immediate that parts ( ii ) of both theorems follow from the respective parts ( i ) .",
    "furthermore , the proof of theorem  [ thm : ent ]  ( i ) may be completed by using corollary  [ cor : arows_dist ] and the relation @xmath127 since then @xmath128 but is clear once we notice that for any row of a staircase tableau exactly one of the following statements is true    * it contains a @xmath14 * it is indexed by @xmath13 .",
    "this proves theorem  [ thm : ent ] and we now turn our attention to a considerably more involved proof of theorem  [ thm : diag ]  ( i ) .",
    "the idea is the same as for corollary  [ cor : arows_dist ] except that this time we will actually need the joint probability generating function of @xmath5 and @xmath56 .",
    "the final expression will turn out to be substantially more complicated than what we encountered earlier and thus harder to analyze .",
    "nonetheless , the situation is quite analogous to the case of the number of rows in permutation tableaux ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) ) .",
    "for the reader s convenience we break up our proof into several steps each of them discussed in a separate section below .",
    "we now briefly outline the major steps in the proof indicating the section in which they are treated .",
    "we begin in the forthcoming section with the derivation of the probability generating function .",
    "its coefficients satisfy certain recurrences .",
    "this , in particular , enables us to derive the exact formulas for the expected value and the variance of @xmath5 ( see subsection  [ subsec : exp_var ] below ) .",
    "furthermore , the nature of these recurrences suggests that the coefficients are related to the classical eulerian number associated with the number of rises in random permutations .",
    "in fact , our coefficients exactly match the numbers often called the eulerian numbers of type b. we establish and discuss further this connection in subsection  [ subsec : euler ] .",
    "we think it is of independent interest and perhaps worthy of further exploration .",
    "once this connection is made it is then expected that the the coefficients follow the normal law ( just as the classical eulerian numbers do ) . as a matter of fact , one of the proofs (",
    "although not the first ) of the asymptotic normality of the classical eulerian numbers is via a fairly general device due to bender ( @xcite ) and nowadays referred to as bender s theorem .",
    "this is , indeed , the approach we take and in the subsection  [ subsec : bender ] we verify the conditions of bender s theorem to conclude our proof .",
    "we give the formula for the joint generating function of @xmath56 and @xmath5 in the following statement .",
    "[ prop : bivgf ] let @xmath129 be complex numbers",
    ". then we have @xmath130 where the coefficients @xmath131 satisfy the following recurrence @xmath132 with the following boundary conditions : @xmath133    if @xmath134 and we set @xmath135 then both sides of are 1 .",
    "otherwise , let @xmath136 indicate the event that we put an @xmath13 in the @xmath137th box on the diagonal ( counting from ne to sw ) .",
    "then @xmath138 and we have @xmath139 where we have used the basic properties of the conditional expectations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formulas  ( 16 ) , p.  79 and",
    "( 17 ) , p.  80 ) ) .",
    "now , @xmath140 means that we put an @xmath13 in the sw corner .",
    "in that case we have @xmath61 and since this happens with probability @xmath141 we get @xmath142 the second term is equal to @xmath143 combining we obtain @xmath144 using the second part of leads to the basic recurrence @xmath145 upon further iteration of this relation we obtain for any @xmath146 : @xmath147 for some coefficients @xmath148 , @xmath149 . to see that they satisfy the stated recurrence , we apply the basic recurrence ( with @xmath150 instead of @xmath4 and @xmath151 instead of @xmath57 ) to the expectation on the right  hand side above .",
    "we get that it is equal to @xmath152 substituting this into the above formula for @xmath153 and multiplying both sides by @xmath154 ( to avoid writing a denominator on the right  hand side ) we get @xmath155 splitting this in two sums , isolating the @xmath156 term in the first , and the @xmath157 in the second , and then shifting the index in the second sum , we further obtain @xmath158 so , if we write it as @xmath159 as postulated above , we see that @xmath160 and , upon combining the two middle sums , that @xmath161 taking @xmath162 we get @xmath163 and since @xmath164 we can write @xmath165 where the coefficients @xmath166 satisfy the stated recurrence and the boundary conditions .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "a number of properties of @xmath167 can be deduced from proposition  [ prop : bivgf ] .",
    "we illustrate this by obtaining the exact expression for the expected value and for the variance of @xmath5 . to help facilitate that we put the coefficients @xmath168 in a pascal type triangle .",
    "@xmath169 the sw move from a coefficient @xmath170 has weight @xmath151 and a se move has weight @xmath171 .",
    "the value of a given coefficient is obtained by summing over all possible paths leading to it from the root @xmath172 the products of weighs corresponding to the moves along the path .",
    "for example , there is only one path leading to @xmath173 ( all moves are se ) and hence @xmath174 likewise , paths leading to @xmath175 have exactly one sw move ; thus there are @xmath4 of them and if the sole sw move is from @xmath176 , @xmath177 , then the weight of that path is @xmath178 consequently , @xmath179 the significance of this is that @xmath180 this proves the first part of . similarly , to compute the variance we use @xmath181 and the fact that @xmath182",

    "we take a closer look at the doubly indexed sequence @xmath192 since it has intriguing connections that may be of interest in their own right .",
    "it is featured as entry a145901 in @xcite and is closely related to another sequence from @xcite , namely a039755 .",

    "since we are dealing exclusively with the case @xmath197 we drop the subscript and we write @xmath198 for @xmath199 .",
    "thus , the generating function of @xmath5 may be written as @xmath200 it is perhaps of interest to mention that the numbers @xmath201 themselves satisfy the central ( and local ) limit theorem as was shown in @xcite . however , this is not exactly what we want since the generating function above is in powers of @xmath202 rather than @xmath203 . in terms of powers of @xmath203 @xmath204 has the following form .",
