    "question about market microdynamics is of fundamental importance . it influences wide range of items : bid - ask spread dynamics , interaction of market agents setting market and limit orders , patterns of price formation and provision of liquidity .",
    "these subjects are investigated using wide range of analytic tools , trying to capture cross - correlation structure of price evolution and volatilities through time series analysis  @xcite or studying dynamics of price formation through simulation of detailed market mechanics  @xcite .",
    "these methods concentrate on search of the source of random forces acting over continuous or discrete time sets .",
    "these sets are considered homogeneous when long - term returns are considered . on the shorter scale ( in tick data ) , it is noticed that the trading frequency scales the returns making time sets non - homogeneous .",
    "theoretical construction is built in  @xcite to account for such effect .",
    "in contrast to statistical methods , the behavioral finance searches patterns of dynamics of collective actions of various market agents making assumptions about their perception and searching for equilibrium and/or limiting solution to price / spread prediction problem  @xcite .",
    "all above mentioned methods analyze price returns . in this article",
    "we introduce new object for such analysis , a trend  .",
    "common definition of trend is _ `` the general direction in which something tends to move''_. visually trend can be identified as a line with little random deviations .",
    "of course , trends were studied many times before .",
    "however , they were studied often in relation to question of deterministic behavior of price .",
    "we think , that the existence of trend is not @xmath0 deterministic and in general does not disapprove statistical nature of price behavior .",
    "indeed , there is a non - zero probability to find straight line in price path generated using , for example , black - scholes model  @xcite .",
    "despite this fact , crowd of market participants still believes that such trends are due to some hidden bits of information and therefore contribute to trend persistence or otherwise .    in this paper",
    "we would like to merge these two ideas of considering price evolution through scope of trend and through random walk .",
    "indeed , the presentation of price path in terms of price returns ( random walk ) is suitable in connection to capm and alike theories , where profit and risks are related in search of optimal investment portfolio . on the other side ,",
    "presentation of price evolution in terms of short - term price trends better conforms description of market microdynamics .",
    "the trend is an object worth to study because as we show it gives insight into microstructure of market dynamics .",
    "it allows direct observation of spread dynamics , price information update , costs , trading activity and response time of the exchange .",
    "this information is diluted when correlation analysis of price return series is used . in this paper trends are studied without consideration of news impact to the price move but only in relation to dynamics of agents interaction via exchange .",
    "exchange is a dynamic system .",
    "it allows traders to interact with each other .",
    "it consists of many components .",
    "these parts are specialists on the floor , electronic platform which helps to account and match trades through software and a wire connection to trader computers .",
    "traders use electronic platforms to trade .",
    "both systems , of traders and of exchange , have their respective non - zero latencies and therefore the speed of information diffusion is non - zero  . the latencies influence price dynamics and respective trading algorithms .",
    "this study draws attention to the influence of dynamics of systems used for trading on the dynamics of price .",
    "we extract information content of such dynamics from trends and spreads data .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss trend arbitrage .",
    "the respective relationship has been derived and is taken as starting point to further analysis .",
    "second , one applies an algorithm searching for linear trend in time series of bids and asks observed on stock markets .",
    "third , several distributions are obtained to support the relationship developed from trend arbitrage requirement .",
    "several outcomes have been discussed as well .",
    "in the following , one analyze intra - day trend seen in prices of an asset which is traded in double auction .    for brevity of explanation we assume two kind of market agents : specialists and investors .",
    "specialists maintain sell- and buy - prices ( asks and bids , respectively ) in continuous manner .",
    "bids and asks generally move together . spread between them ( spread = ask - bid ) tends to some minimum level due to competition between specialists .",
    "this level depends on risk perceived by specialists to take their market share . in stress situations ,",
    "especially when price directionally moves to the new level , spread increases .",
    "the question now is what this dependency is .",
    "a simple example helps to find an answer .",
    "specialist provides bid and ask prices earning spread . investor profits by taking directional bets .",
    "suppose now that the price moves within up - trend , @xmath1 , with spread , @xmath2 , see figure  [ fig : trend_arb ] .",
    "+ investor buys asset at ask - price , @xmath3 , at @xmath4 moment . after a while he sells it .",
    "if the trend did not change its direction and investor waits long enough , till time @xmath5 , he can sell asset at bid - price , @xmath6 .",
    "investor will make _ no profit _ if :    @xmath7    investor must meet three conditions to profit for sure :    * @xmath8 is non decreasing during the period between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; * trading system of investor is faster than that of specialist and trading system of specialist is slower than some market reaction value , @xmath9 ; * spread is small enough , satisfying  ( [ eq : arb1 ] ) .",
    "knowing these conditions ( consciously or not ) , specialist sets spread such that he makes no losses , i.e. @xmath6 is kept equal to @xmath3 or less .",
    "same arguments are applied to down - trend , which changes @xmath1 to @xmath8 . therefore , ( [ eq : arb1 ] ) is modified and",
    "limit on spread can be set : @xmath10 + where @xmath11 .",
    "more general expression must also include additional costs to be paid by investor related to his trading activity and some structure of characteristic time , @xmath9 :    @xmath12     + where @xmath13 is a broker fee and similar additive costs , @xmath14 is exchange - wide latency and @xmath15 is stock specific latency .",
    "@xmath15 can be attributed to aggregated latencies of trading platforms used by investors to trade the same stock .",
    "these inequalities suggest that the non - zero spread is due to both , transaction costs and latencies of trading and exchange systems .",
    "now , let us look at the relationships through data analysis perspective .",
    "tick price / volume data of 33 stocks traded at amsterdam ( nld ) , frankfurt ( ger ) , madrid ( spa ) , paris ( fra ) and milan ( itl ) were collected over the second half of the year 2003 .",
    "this data includes bid , ask and trade prices and respective volumes attached to time stamps .",
    "time period considered is between 15:30 and 17:30 of european time .",
    "dividend information was not used because it does not affect our intraday analysis .",
    "data were filtered .",
    "only those bits of information were used in analysis where price of either bid or ask has been updated .",
    "any such change is treated as `` information update '' .",
    "linear fit ( details can be found elsewhere @xcite ) was applied to series of one day mid - prices , @xmath16 .",
    "bid - ask spread , @xmath17 , is understood as an uncertainty of observed price information ( this item to be discussed further ) .",
    "data were fit continuously . this way real - time feed is simulated , where only past information is available .",
    "an output of fit is series of current trend parameters such as series of impact , @xmath18 , series of slope ( trend ) , @xmath19 , with respective errors , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "these parameters allow prediction of forward price , @xmath22 , and price error , @xmath23 : @xmath24 @xmath25 + condition to trigger end of current trend :    @xmath26     + where @xmath27 is cut value , which is chosen to be equal to 2.3 .",
    "this particular choice of cut - off value was determined visually from trends superimposed on the price plot ( see figure ( [ fig : trend_fit ] ) .",
    "there is an intuitive feeling that the less cut - off value generates too many spurious trends and dilutes effects we are looking for .",
    "use of price returns is a limiting case for trends with just two points . on the other side",
    ", the larger cut - off value will lead to reduced sensitivity of spread information to trends .",
    "trend search starts at the beginning of each day series with a seed of three points .",
    "algorithm continues to fit line till the trigger ( [ eq : trigger ] ) is hit .",
    "it then assumes that within the search time window ( between current point and the beginning of current trend ) there are two trends .",
    "algorithm starts backward search in order to find an optimal breaking time point between current and forward trends .",
    "the point is found at the minimum of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are of current ( @xmath30 ) and of forward ( @xmath31 ) trends .",
    "this point becomes the end of current trend and the start of forward one .",
    "the forward trend becomes current .",
    "and so on till the end of day . each trend is then accompanied with respective information :          the rejected trends with @xmath47 tend to have smaller @xmath8 . in case of",
    "less expressed trends the market enters intermediate regime known from technical analysis as `` side trend '' .",
    "let us make trivial rearrangement of equation ( [ eq : arb3 ] ) by moving observables to the left side of inequality and dividing both sides by @xmath1 : @xmath48 to test this expression we measure @xmath2 as @xmath49 , the average update time , @xmath15 , as @xmath41 and @xmath1 as trend slope ( all are defined in previous section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : trend_id ] ) ) .",
    "a distribution of @xmath50 value for all @xmath51-trends found in abn - amro stock price , is plotted on figure  [ fig : market_response ] .",
    "comparison of abn - amro quantiles of @xmath52 with quantiles of normal distribution and with quantiles of @xmath52 for several other stocks indicate their similarity to log - normal p.d.f . and between each other , see figure  [ fig : quantiles ] .",
    "@xmath53-distribution starts sharply at some moment after zero-time which is market reaction time , @xmath14 ( see ( [ eq : arb4 ] ) ) , assuming @xmath54 equal to zero is a limit , when market - maker does not pay fee per transaction and @xmath1 is large enough . ] .",
    "@xmath14 value is calibrated using @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is log - normal function .",
    "the front - end value is calculated at 1% of fitted log - normal p.d.f .. @xmath14 values per stock are plotted in figure [ fig : market_resolution ] .",
    "exchange averages of @xmath14 , @xmath57 , are given on the same plot and are quoted in table  [ tab : market_resolution ] .        [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         we may conclude from this result , that ( [ eq : tick_arb ] ) absorbs all stock specific and ( probably ) exchange - wide latencies information .",
    "in fact , all results described in this article should be confirmed from actual hardware response , i.e. direct measurement of all latencies within exchange and traders computers / software .",
    "a simplified model of price evolution has been implemented to understand empirical results .",
    "the price increment of this model follows @xmath58 .",
    "trend search algorithm ( given in section [ sec : trend_id ] ) is imposed to generated price time series .",
    "trends found with that procedure are stored in the same fashion as we did for real data .",
    "two important points have to be mentioned :    * the model assumes generation of prices at equal time intervals , i.e. trading activity is not simulated and * spread is assumed to be constant and is not dependent on the trend ;    in particular , the model reproduces normal distribution of @xmath59 for all tracks .",
    "this leads to an idea that the description of price evolution with some random walk model is equivalent to description of price via trends , which also can be stochastic  .    to be more specific",
    "let us consider some stochastic model describing price dynamics , like black - scholes model , @xmath60 with growth rate , @xmath1 , volatility , @xmath61 , and @xmath23 , some value to cut the trend , like @xmath27 in ( [ eq : trigger ] ) , as parameters .",
    "then , there is a homeomorphic transformation in parametric space into another model describing same price dynamics in terms of trends , @xmath62 , with trend slope , @xmath1 , trend duration , @xmath63 , and quality , @xmath64 , as parameters .",
    "quality , @xmath64 , characterizes amount of fluctuations around trend ( spread dynamics ) .",
    "looking closer to relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , figure  [ fig : strong_rel_2d ] ,        we can find strong relationship : @xmath67 + where @xmath68 is stock dependent and ranges between 0.3 and 1.1 , see figure  [ fig : beta ] , and @xmath69 is random wiener process scaled roughly as @xmath9 .",
    "+ indeed , the distribution of difference @xmath70 has a peak around zero and fits to normal p.d.f . where part of distribution is cut due to trend arbitrage , which plays role of natural constrain for price generaion process ( [ eq : strong_eq ] ) .",
    "@xmath68 is found through two - step procedure :    * slices in @xmath71 are fit to normal p.d.f . , @xmath72 ; * @xmath73 are fit to @xmath74    it is difficult to interpret meaning of this relationship , because dimensionalities of l.h.s and r.h.s . of equation ( [ eq : strong_eq ] ) ,",
    "[ @xmath75 and [ @xmath76 , are different .",
    "there is some reference model though @xcite , which suggests fractionality of return process : @xmath77    the main difference , however , with the mentioned result is that sabr - model describes process of last prices , while equation ( [ eq : strong_eq ] ) describes bid - ask update . the relationship between",
    "bid - ask update process and trade process is subject of the next article .",
    "the presented analysis has demonstrated importance of analysis of short - term trends as it gives better insight into micro - dynamics of the market .    using simple mechanistic arguments",
    "the trend arbitrage inequality is developed .",
    "empirical tests prove the inequality to hold .",
    "the inequality sets limit on bid - ask spread which is determined by the latencies of exchange and trading systems and by some costs .",
    "these latencies can also be identified directly by measuring delay between sending time of the order from traders computer and appearance of this order in the exchange book .",
    "flat distribution of probability of @xmath42 of trend fit demonstrates that the spread bears instant information about price uncertainty in the process of price measurement .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of investor the next _ last price _ will be within the current bid - ask spread .",
    "further analysis suggests some strong relationship between spread , trend and time of trades update .",
    "although dimensionality problem of the equation remains , the theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is still waiting to appear .",
    "the final conclusion is that the price evolution can be equally described through random walk or trends .",
    "however , market participants induce such spread dynamics as the trend exists and they limit their actions to conform trend arbitrage requirement .    in the future research",
    ", we plan to investigate relationship between _ price update _ and @xmath78 processes using the same type of analysis of trend associated information .",
