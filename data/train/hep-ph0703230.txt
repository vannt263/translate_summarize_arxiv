    "shear viscosity @xmath0 is a transport coefficient which has recently been attracting lots of attention .",

    "it is conjectured @xcite that , no matter how strong the interparticle interaction is , the shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath3 ratio has a minimum bound @xmath4 .",
    "i.e. @xmath1 @xmath5 in any system .",
    "the bound was motivated by the uncertainty principle and the observation that @xmath1 @xmath6 for a large class of strongly interacting quantum field theories whose dual descriptions in string theory involve black holes in anti - de sitter space policastro:2001yc , policastro:2002se , herzog:2002fn , buchel:2003tz . in ref .",
    "@xcite , supporting evidence of the conjecture was given for matters like h@xmath7o , he and n. their @xmath1 curves reach their minima near the gas - liquid phase transitions with the bound well satisfied .",
    "recently , @xmath2 close to the minimum bound was found in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) @xcite ( and in lattice simulations of a gluon plasma @xcite ) just above the deconfinement temperature @xmath8(@xmath9 mev at zero baryon density kl04 ) . this suggests the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is strongly interacting at this temperature , which is quite different from the traditional picture of weakly interacting qgp .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , it was found that @xmath1 of qcd in the confinement and deconfinement phases is qualitatively different .",
    "when @xmath10 ( the confinement phase ) , @xmath1 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath11 because the system is dominated by goldstone bosons which interact more weakly at lower @xmath12 when @xmath13  ( the deconfinement phase ) , @xmath1 is monotonically increasing in @xmath11 because the interaction between quarks and gluons is weaker at higher @xmath11 due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "it makes perfect sense to have the phase transition from the point of view of preserving the @xmath1 minimum bound .",
    "this is because if the qualitative behavior of @xmath1 is not changed by a phase transition ( or crossover ) , then the bound could be violated .",
    "one concludes that the minimum or valley of the @xmath1 curve lies in the vicinity of @xmath8 ( the extrapolation of the low(high ) temperature @xmath1 curve sets a upper(lower ) bound on @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior is also seen in the h@xmath7o , he and n systems .",
    "it was further noticed that below the critical pressure , a cusp appears at the minimum of @xmath1  which coincides with the critical temperatures @xcite .    in ref .",

    "it is interesting to recheck wether co really is an anomaly .",
    "however , even without considering co , the sign of the @xmath1  jump for first order phase transitions might not be universal , either . for qcd in the limit of a large number of colors ,",
    "the jump is negative from the low to high temperature phases csernai:2006zz .",
    "we have computed the shear viscosity of qcd in the hadronic phase by the coupled boltzmann equations of pions and nucleons in low temperatures and low baryon number densities .",
    "the ratio @xmath1 maps out the nuclear gas - liquid phase transition by forming a valley tracing the phase transition line in the temperature - chemical potential plane .",
    "when the phase transition turns into a crossover , the @xmath1 valley also gradually disappears .",
    "we suspect the general feature for a first - order phase transition is that @xmath2 has a discontinuity in the bottom of the @xmath1 valley .",
    "the discontinuity coincides with the phase transition line and ends at the critical point . beyond the critical point ,",
    "a smooth @xmath1 valley is seen on the crossover side .",
    "however , the valley could disappear far away from the critical point .",
    "the @xmath1 measurements might provide an alternative to identify the critical points .",
