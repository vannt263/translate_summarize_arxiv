    "quantum communications represent very important part of a rapidly developing research area called quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "communications networks are nowadays an indispensable technology allowing people to transmit information quickly over large distances . in classical communications networks",
    "classical physics laws are used for their construction .",
    "the recent research in quantum physics and quantum information suggests that quantum laws of nature can provide significant improvement of capabilities of communications devices @xcite , while using similar resources and keeping similar network architecture @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , a significant amount of theoretical and experimental research has been dedicated to the concept of quantum communications networks @xcite .",
    "most notable result of this effort is a number of protocols for quantum cryptography @xcite , which is a method for unconditionally secure transmission of information using various quantum properties of information carriers .",
    "quantum communications networks can benefit from purely quantum effects such as entanglement or probabilistic nature of measurement .",
    "the more complex both the classical and quantum networks are , the more pronounced is the need for correct routing of the signal from its source to its intended destination @xcite .",
    "classical routers are well known ingredient of classical networks allowing to direct signal information according to control information ( e.g. ip address ) @xcite .",
    "the analogy between classical and quantum networks suggests that complex quantum networks would also require elaborate routing protocols .",
    "this need is even more pronounce since in contrast to classical information , one can not perfectly duplicate an unknown qubit of quantum information @xcite .",
    "however , approximate cloning is possible and has been intensely studied both theoretically and experimentally over the last decades @xcite resulting in , e.g. , establishing and implementing optimal state - dependent cloning for a wide class of qubit distributions @xcite . nevertheless the impossibility of perfect cloning prevents using the concept of multi - directional broadcast ( known from classical networks ) in a quantum network .        in this paper",
    "we address the problem of designing a quantum router ( see conceptional scheme in fig . [",
    "fig : concept ] ) .",
    "we consider the platform of individual photons and linear optics because of its experimental accessibility and also because of the particular suitability of light for information transmission @xcite .",
    "the router has to fulfil four requirements to be suitable for quantum communications networks : ( i ) both the signal and control information have to be stored in quantum objects ( qubits ) , therefore routers using classical information to route quantum signal are considered only semi - quantum routers .",
    "( ii ) the signal information is unchanged under the routing operation , the degree of freedom used to store the signal qubit information has to be kept undisturbed .",
    "( iii ) the router has to be able to route the signal into a coherent superposition of both output modes .",
    "( iv ) the router has to work without any need for post - selection on the signal output .",
    "if the router is probabilistic , successful operation can be identified by detection on the control state .",
    "( v ) to optimize the resources of the quantum network , only individual control qubit is required to direct one signal qubit",
    ".    there has been several schemes for quantum router already proposed , some of them habe been experimentally implemented , but none of them however meets all the five requirements defined in the above paragraph .",
    "the first group of these proposals uses light - matter interaction in order to achieve quantum routing @xcite .",
    "such interaction is however often very challenging for experimental implementation .",
    "the second group of the proposals considers solely the platform of optical interactions to accomplish the routing .",
    "there are some proposals for semi - quantum router , where the control information is classical using intensive light pulses @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals where the control information is quantum , but the signal state collapses in the router so the requirement ( ii ) is not met @xcite .",
    "recently we have proposed a fully quantum router using only linear optics @xcite .",
    "this device however does not meet the requirement ( v ) since it requires two quantum bits to control routing of one single qubit of signal information .",
    "in this section we describe an all - linear - optical quantum router that meets all the five requirements mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the router makes use of three quantum gates : controlled - phase gate ( c - phase gate ) @xcite , quantum non - demolition presence detection gate ( qnd gate ) @xcite and programmable - phase gate ( ppg ) @xcite . in order for the setup to work completely without need for signal post - selection , both the qnd and the detector d",
    "have to be equipped with photon - number resolving detectors . without them ,",
    "the router still works , but does not fulfil the requirement ( iv ) .",

    "the qnd presence detection requires an entangled pair of photons as a resource , but these photons are of a fixed quantum state , are generated locally solely for the purposes of the qnd gate and do not take other part in the quantum network .",
    "the control qubit state does not change under the qnd gate , but success probability factor of @xmath16 is added to take into account the success probability of the qnd gate . more information about the qnd gate can be found in ref . @xcite . in the last step ,",
    "the control qubit is subjected to a half - wave plate rotated at 22.5 yielding terms @xmath17 and then the control qubit alone impinge on the ppg composed just of a pbs .",
    "the ppg gate heralds successful operation only if there is a control qubit with horizontal polarization at its input thus projecting the signal in the lower arm onto @xmath18 and in this form it impinges on the pbs@xmath19 .",
