    "the formation of stars in the smallest galaxies provides a strong test for current theories for structure formation .",
    "hierarchical models require the production of many small halos to act as the building blocks for larger halos . but",
    "star - formation within small dark matter halos must be suppressed to a large degree to prevent the universe from `` over - cooling '' and the over - production of local group dwarf galaxies ( klypin et al 1999 , moore et al 1999 ) . this may be achieved by invoking strong stellar feedback within dwarfs ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 ) or by heating and photo - ionizing the gas in dwarf halos during the epoch of re - ionization ( bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ) . however , neither simple wind models nor re - ionization alone are able to reproduce the dependence of dwarf galaxy morphology and star - formation history on its local environment .",
    "environment is perhaps the most important regulator of dwarf galaxy star - formation .",
    "gas - poor dwarf galaxies are the most strongly clustered galaxies in the local universe , found only as the satellites of larger galaxies or in clusters of galaxies ( binggeli , tarenghi & sandage 1990 , hogg et al .",
    "2003 ) , and are dominated by old and intermediate age stellar populations ( see reviews by ferguson & binggeli 1994 , grebel 1997 ) . like",
    "late - type spirals and star - forming dwarf galaxies ( dis ) , dwarf ellipticals ( des ) and dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) possess exponential surface brightness profiles .",
    "the existence of an intermediate - class of dwarfs with low gas fractions , low star - formation rates , significant rotation ( simien & prugniel 2002 ) , and in several cases , residual spiral arm structure ( jerjen , kalnajs , & binggeli 2000 ) , imply an evolutionary transition between late - type gas - rich dwarfs and des ( lin & faber 1983 , moore , lake , & katz 1998 )",
    ". however , many des do not rotate ( geha , guhathakurta , & van der marel 2002 ) , and have higher surface brightnesses ( bothun et al .",
    "1986 ) and higher chemical abundances ( grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) than expected for dis which have simply lost their gas and stopped forming stars .",
    "the origin of these des remains unknown .",
    "several different possibilities imply distinct star - formation and accretion histories for the cluster de populations .",
    "if dwarf formation is strongly suppressed after re - ionization , dwarfs in high density regions may be more able to survive because they are more likely to collapse and form stars before the epoch of re - ionization ( tully et al .",
    "the pressure of the intra - cluster gaseous medium can prevent strong winds from blowing out much of the dwarfs gas and allow them to quickly form multiple generations of stars ( babul & rees 1992 ) . in this scenario , the de cluster populations are among the oldest cluster members . on the other hand , dynamical studies of the dwarf galaxy populations in the nearby virgo and fornax clusters suggest that the de populations are not as relaxed as the giant elliptical populations and may have been recently accreted by the cluster potentials ( drinkwater , gregg , & colless 2001 ; conselice , gallagher , & wyse 2001 ) . over time , processes such as ram - pressure stripping , strong tidal interactions , and `` galaxy harassment '' may remove the gas and halt star - formation in galaxies in cluster environments as they are accreted from the field ( e.g. moore , lake & katz 1998 ) . compared to the field populations at similar epochs , bright cluster galaxies have suppressed star - formation rates and lower fractions of star - forming and blue galaxies ( balogh et al .",
    "1997 , ellingson et al 2001 ) .",
    "gas removal by the cluster environment may be even more efficient for low - mass galaxies and could transform star - forming dwarfs into des and dsphs .",
    "therefore , many des may be recent cluster acquisitions with relatively young stellar populations .    at @xmath11 0.4 , where h@xmath12 is shifted out of the optical wavelength region , the [ oii ] 3727   emission doublet is one of strongest optical tracers of the low density , photo - ionized nebulae associated with star - forming regions .",

    ", we conducted a deep narrow - band [ oii ] 3727   emission - line search for the faint star - forming galaxies in the extremely massive and morphologically irregular cluster abell 851 at @xmath13 .",
    "we detected several hundred [ oii ] emission - line galaxy candidates with a number density 3 - 4 times that observed for field [ oii ] galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "however , we found a deficit of extremely high [ oii ] equivalent width objects relative to the field and concluded that abell 851 s environment is suppressing strong star - formation",
    ". therefore , many of abell 851 s faint star - forming galaxies could fade into the de cluster population observed today .    in this paper",
    ", we present a similar [ oii ] 3727   emission - line search in the less massive but more relaxed @xmath1 cluster ms1512.4 + 3647 and compare the properties of its star - forming dwarf population to that of abell 851 . in  2 , we present the narrow - band [ oii ] 3727   observations of ms1512.4 + 3647 , and identify interlopers by their broad - band colors . in  3 , we compare the luminosity function and clustering properties of ms1512.4 + 3647 [ oii ] emission - line candidates to the abell 851 and field [ oii ] emission - line populations .",
    "we find that , unlike abell 851 , the ms1512.4 + 3647 [ oii ] luminosity function shows no excess above the field , and is likely dominated by field [ oii ] emitters which surround the cluster . in  4 , we constrain star - formation histories and timescales of the field - dominated ms1512.4 + 3647 star - forming galaxy sample and compare the derived star - formation histories to those found for abell 851 .",

    "on the other hand , the weakest emission - line galaxies may have bright continua and be well detected in both the on and off band images , but the emission - line flux may be on the level of a few times the uncertainty in the on - band flux . thus our emission - line search will be incomplete for both intrinsically faint objects with low continuum fluxes and for objects with higher continuum fluxes but faint [ oii ] emission . because the sum of the on- and off - band images was used to detect the objects , our ability to detect an object is primarily a function of its summed on- and off - band flux and will decrease as the object s total summed flux approaches the detection limit .    however , the detection of a galaxy depends not only on its total flux but its surface brightness as well .",
    "galaxies with normally observable total fluxes but large scalelengths and low surface brightnesses may not be detected because the flux per pixel is comparable to the sky noise .",

    "the field - dominated ms1512.4 + 3647 and foreground abell 851 field samples lack the galaxies with star - formation decay timescales @xmath6 100 myr - 1 gyr that dominate the abell 851 cluster emission - line galaxy population .",
    "such star - formation timescales are expected if star - formation is gradually suppressed as field galaxies are accreted by the cluster ( balogh et al .",
    "therefore , the low density of [ oii ] emission line galaxies and the absence of intermediate - color emission - line galaxies in ms1512.4 + 3647 suggests that relatively few star - forming galaxies have been accreted by the ms1512.4 + 3647 cluster in the previous gyr . on the other hand , the abundance of intermediate color emission - line galaxies , and the absence of high [ oii ] ew galaxies in abell 851 are consistent with the recent accretion of many of abell 851 s star - forming galaxies .    the field emission - line galaxy population surrounding ms1512.4 + 3647 is forming stars in bursts with @xmath6 10 - 100 myr .",
    "galaxies with the highest [ oii ] ews and bluest colors in both samples are typically among the lowest luminosity systems .",
    "these faint starbursts have young stellar populations with masses @xmath158 , but could hide up to a additional factor of ten in stellar mass in an old faded stellar population . if the observed star - forming galaxies around ms1512.4 + 3647 and abell 851 fall into the clusters potential wells and",
    "rapidly cease star production , they could fade to be as faint as de in local clusters .",
    "however , the large numbers of present - day cluster des require typical infall rates much greater than those implied by our observations of ms1512.4 + 3647 .",
    "the large de cluster populations can be acquired only if most have been accreted before @xmath97 0.4 or in several major merger events ( as in abell 851 ) .",
