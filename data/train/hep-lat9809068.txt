    "the study of genetic algorithms based upon the theory of evolution originates with john holland  @xcite in the mid-1970s",
    ". applications in various fields have been proposed . in generic gas ,",
    "potential solutions are represented as symbolic strings and operators are defined on the analogy of selection and genetic mechanisms in nature .",
    "a crossover operator of exchanging genes between individuals leads to the special feature of gas in which discrete points in searching space are treated at once , while normal metropolis ( mp ) or heat bath ( hb ) algorithms treat only one point .",
    "we proposed a hybrid ga and applied it to pure su(2 ) gauge theory in 2 dimensions .",
    "physical values obtained by our hybrid gas , such as the action per plaquette and wilson loops at each @xmath0 are consistent with those given by hbs .",
    "our results show that the distinctive features of this new gas leads to be the fast thermalization .",
    "the short calculation time are accomplished by the special encoding configurations on a lattice .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have designed a hga and applied it to @xmath1 @xmath2 lattice gauge theory and calculated the action per plaquette and the wilson loops .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for small @xmath3 the action per plaquette obtained by hga",
    "have been averaged over the last 32 generations out of 64 generations keeping a population size of @xmath4 , while for large @xmath0s ( @xmath5 ) over 16 generations out of 32 generations with a population size of 128 .",
    "the average of wilson loops obtained with mp were taken over 1000 iterations of the best genome among the population in the @xmath6 generation of hga for @xmath0s between @xmath7 ( of the best genome in the @xmath8 generation for @xmath9 ) . over the whole @xmath0 region",
    "the result of the physical averages are consistent with hb .",
    "they are obtained by hga faster than by hb and normal mp , without any further optimization of the ga part of our procedure .",
    "we have shown the possibility and effectiveness of ga schemes for su(n ) lattice gauge theory . a more detailed discussion and analysis is needed to demonstrate the detailed balance properties .",
    "there is also enough room for further optimization of our algorithm .",
