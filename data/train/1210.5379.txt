    "the field of rydberg atoms which possess a highly excited valence electron has been established decades ago , and it is still an active one today ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review and references therein ) .",
    "one reason for the interest in such highly excited atoms is the fact that important properties of these atoms in general scale universally with powers of the principal quantum number @xmath0 . for highly excited atoms ( @xmath1 )",
    "this leads , e.g. , to extremely large extensions up to the size of a virus , huge polarizabilities as well as van der waals - coefficients and long lifetimes , making these atoms ideal candidates for applications in quantum simulations or quantum computing @xcite .",
    "besides these remarkable properties , rydberg atoms are also of great interest , because they are able to form very weakly bound molecules together with a second atom in the ground state @xcite .",
    "such rydberg molecules were first realised in 2009 with rubidium atoms @xcite , and the experiment showed that the basic properties of the molecule can be well described within a simple model @xcite . regarding the ground state atom  as a small perturber which is polarised by the rydberg electron",
    "the interaction can be described theoretically by a low - energy scattering process .",
    "if the respective scattering length is negative , the interaction leads , within a mean - field approximation , to a binding and oscillatory molecular potential , and the theoretical predictions agree very well with the measured vibrational spectra of the molecules @xcite .",
    "however , a remarkable and not yet fully explained property of the rydberg molecules is that surprisingly they exhibit mean lifetimes @xmath2 which are clearly reduced when compared to the bare atomic rydberg state @xcite .",
    "butscher @xcite found that the atomic background gas has a significant influence on the lifetime due to inter - particle collisions .",
    "for the decay rate @xmath3 they found a linear dependence @xmath4 on the background gas density @xmath5 which can be explained using classical scattering theory .",
    "however , regarding the vibrational ground state in the limit @xmath6 , the background atoms can not play a role in the reduction of the lifetimes .",
    "nevertheless , the measurements indicate a ground state s lifetime of @xmath7s while the bare atoms have a lifetime of @xmath8s . in this zero density limit ,",
    "the system only consists of three parts , namely the rydberg core , the rydberg electron and the ground state atom , so , obviously , the reduced lifetime must be caused by the ground state atom  somehow perturbing the rydberg wave function .    in order to uncover the reason for this difference in the lifetimes of about 25%",
    ", a convenient approach in molecular physics would be to evaluate the non - adiabatic energy terms which govern the energy transfer between nuclear and electronical motion .",
    "these terms couple a particular rydberg state with the continuum of dissociation of a lower - lying one and , thus , allow for a predissociation process under the change of the electronic state .",
    "in addition to spontaneous photon emission and blackbody induced radiation , such a process may further shorten the lifetime of the molecule . however , a quantitative evaluation of the corresponding decay rate requires the determination of the non - adiabatic coupling terms which is a difficult task .    as an alternative , we therefore persue a different approach in this paper to investigate the decay mechanism initiated by the ground state atom  in a rydberg molecule . that is based on a quantum - classical description of the rydberg molecule @xcite which allows us to take into account the effect of the ground state atom  onto the rydberg atom beyond the usual treatment of a static disturber . in previous work",
    "@xcite the perturbation of the rydberg state has been considered at a fixed position @xmath9 of the non - moving ground state atom . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a model in which the moving of the ground state atom  plays an important role , viz .",
    "the rydberg state is continuously detuned due to a transfer of kinetic energy from the ground state atom  to the rydberg state . a detuning comparable or larger than the natural linewidth of the rydberg state",
    "will enhance the transition to a lower rydberg state resulting in the decay of the molecule by either spontaneous photon emission or predissociation . as we will show below , the time when",
    "the detuning significantly exceeds the natural linewidth of the vibrational ground state agrees very well with the lifetime in the zero density limit .",
    "moreover , we find that the detuning becomes smaller with increasing principal quantum number , so that the experimentally measured tendency of longer lifetimes with increasing @xmath0 is also in accordance with our treatment .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec - theory ] , we give a brief review of the quantum mechanical description @xcite as well as of the quantum - classical treatment @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] , we apply the latter approach to a rubidium rydberg molecule in the s - state .",
    "the detuning is discussed in detail for the vibrational ground state of a molecule with @xmath10 and comparisons with the corresponding experiment are made .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate the effect of the detuning for different experimentally accessible principal quantum numbers @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , we review the quantum mechanical description of the scattering process between the rydberg electron and the ground state atom  as well as the quantum - classical treatment .",
    "both approaches are discussed briefly and we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the binding mechanism of the rydberg molecule is based on the polarisation of the ground state atom  under the influence of the rydberg electron .",
    "this interaction can be described theoretically using a fermi type pseudopotential @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath9 denote the positions of the rydberg electron and the ground state atom , respectively .",
    "the whole information on the scattering process is given , here , by the s - wave scattering length @xmath14 .",
    "it depends on the wave vector @xmath15 of the rydberg electron and can be expressed by its first - order approximation @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17a.u .",
    "being the zero - energy scattering length and @xmath18 the polarizability of the rubidium target @xcite .",
    "greene @xcite showed that , in a mean - field approximation , this contact interaction leads to the molecular potential @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the value of the rydberg wave function at the position @xmath9 of the ground state atom . in the case of @xmath21",
    ", we obtain an attractive interaction which allows for bound states .",

    "note that , because of energy conservation , the energy of the rydberg state is increased by @xmath26 . ]",
    "note that significant modifications of this potential are caused for small internuclear separations when also p - wave scattering is taken into account by the additional term @xmath27 , with the p - wave scattering length @xmath28a.u.@xcite ( see dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig - pot - trajec - energy]a ) .",
    "this correction is important for the formation of rydberg molecules at energies @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will solely consider the vibrational ground state of the molecule which is located in the outermost potential minimum , and , as can be seen in fig.[fig - pot - trajec - energy]a , the p - wave contribution can be neglected there .",
    "one consequence of the mean - field approach of greene  @xcite is the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq - v - s ] ) associates a _ fixed _",
    "position @xmath9 of the ground state atom  with the potential energy @xmath22 .",
    "physically this is equivalent to the assumption of a vanishing ratio of masses of the two scattering partners , i.e.  @xmath30 .",
    "although the ground state atom is , by far , heavier than the electron ( @xmath31 for rubidium ) , this assumption is not strictly fulfilled .",
    "considering the single scattering events leading to the bound molecule , we must , therefore , expect a momentum and , with it , also an energy transfer between the ground state atom  and the rydberg electron occurring with each orbit of the latter .    in order to take into account such effects",
    ", we will investigate the system in a quantum - classical way @xcite .",
    "we describe the positions and the motion of , both , the rydberg electron as well as the ground state atom  as that of point particles while the scattering process between these two is treated fully quantum mechanically . because of the high excitation of the rydberg atom ( @xmath32 ) , correspondence principle allows us to treat the motion of the rydberg electron in terms of the classical trajectories whose",
    "angular momentum @xmath33 and energy @xmath34 will be quantised semiclassically : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the principal and azimuthal quantum numbers , @xmath38 is the momentum of the rydberg electron and @xmath39 is its distance from the core .",
    "since the interaction between the rydberg electron and the ground state atom  is of contact - like type , we only need to consider those orbits which include the position @xmath9 of the ground state atom . considering a rydberg atom in an s - state ( @xmath40 )",
    ", there remain four ellipses which we _ locally _ approximate by a superposition of plane waves @xmath41 in order to determine their amplitudes @xmath42 , we require this superposition to fulfil    @xmath43    [ eq - system - of - equations ]    i.e.  to reproduce the value of the rydberg wave function and its derivatives identically on the one hand , and to approximately reproduce the second derivatives on the other . here , eq .   has to be understood in the sense that the norm of the difference of both sides be minimal .",
    "altogether , eqs. provide the best possible approximation of the rydberg wave function by the four plane waves .    with the knowledge of the plane waves ,",
    "the scattering interactions can be calculated straightforwardly : each of them represents a rydberg electron with momentum @xmath44 which is scattered to an outgoing wave @xmath45 because of the spherically symmetric angle distribution the total momentum of the outgoing s - wave is @xmath46 , and the momentum transfer @xmath47 is connected with an energy transfer @xmath25 between the ground state atom  and the rydberg electron .    describing successive collisions of @xmath48 electrons by a current density @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the electron density on the @xmath51-th kepler ellipse ) ,",
    "the total momentum transfer @xmath52 over time can be associated with a classical force @xmath53acting on the ground state atom . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the total scattering cross - section and @xmath55 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath56 . the energy detuning over time of the ground state atominduced by eq .",
    "is consequently given by @xmath57 \\",
    ", , \\label{eq - detuning}\\]]where the sum @xmath58 takes into account all four contributing kepler ellipses .",
    "note that , because of energy conservation , the detuning of the rydberg state is given by the negative of eq .  , and that the value of @xmath59 is significantly changing with time because of the vibrational motion of the ground state atom .",
    "thus , an appropriate mean energy detuning can be obtained by averaging eq .",
    "over one oscillation , @xmath60 , \\label{eq - detuning - average}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the periode of the vibrational oscillation .",
    "moreover , since the energy detuning is proportional to the velocity of the ground state atom , @xmath62 , the main contribution is obtained when the ground state atom  is fast and there will be no contribution when it does not move , i.e.  at the turning points of the oscillation .",
    "depending on whether the two scattering partners fly in the same ( @xmath63 ) or in the opposite ( @xmath64 ) direction , the respective contributions to eq .",
    "differ and the latter is always dominant because in this case the term @xmath65 is larger .",
    "therefore , the net effect of eq .   is always an energy transfer from the ground state atom to the rydberg electron , i.e.  the rydberg state is permanently detuned .",
    "the energy detuning is quantum mechanically not strictly forbidden because the vibrational ground state of the rydberg molecule is metastable and has some finite lifetime @xmath2 .",
    "this directly implies a finite width in frequency space @xmath66 which is , for typical lifetimes of a few tens of @xmath67s , on the order of several khz , and , thus , small compared to the level spacing of the rydberg atom .",
    "note that an exponential decrease of the ground state s population leads to a lorentzian form @xmath68 of the spectroscopic line .",
    "consequently , detunings @xmath69 are allowed , but reduce the intensity @xmath70 and , for very low intentities , one expects a change of the electronic state ( e.g.  @xmath71 ) . because the intensity @xmath70 decreases continuously with increasing difference of the frequency @xmath72 and the tail of the lorentzian",
    "is extended infinitely , a clear threshold for the frequency @xmath73 which distinguishes the quantum mechanically allowed region @xmath73 ( where we do not expect a change of the electronic state ) from the forbidden one ( where we do expect the electronic state to change ) does , therefore , not exist .",
    "therefore , we estimate these regimes in the following way : a detuning which is smaller than the natural linewidth , @xmath74 , will be surely allowed , while much larger detunings @xmath75 are quantum mechanically forbidden so that we expect a detuning on the order of a few natural linewidths , @xmath76 , to determine the threshold where the transition of the electronic state will set in resulting in the decay of the molecule by spontaneous photon emission or predissociation .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the effect of the energy detuning in eq . for @xmath77rb rydberg atoms in the spherically symmetric s - state . at first",
    ", we will discuss the detuning of the vibrational ground state in general , then compare the results with the experimentally measured lifetimes and , finally , investigate the effect of different principal quantum numbers @xmath0 on the time development of the detuning . note that all calculations presented take into account a quantum defect correction of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the rydberg molecule is quantum mechanically described by the corresponding wave function @xmath79 .",
    "the vibrational ground state of the molecule is located in the outermost potential minimum of the oscillatory molecular potential and does not extend into one of the neighbouring wells , since their minima are energetically higher than the ground state ( see fig.[fig - pot - trajec - energy]a ) .",
    "this wave function describes the probability density of the ground state atom , which oscillates in this outermost potential well , to be found at a specific internuclear distance .",
    "the classical analogue is a point particle oscillating in this potential well between two turning points @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "fig.[fig - pot - trajec - energy]b shows this oscillation of the ground state atom with a binding energy of @xmath82mhz @xcite for a rydberg molecule in which the rydberg atom is excited to the @xmath10 s - state . in this case , the turning points are @xmath83a.u .  and",
    "@xmath84a.u .    in the framework of the conservative mean - field potential",
    "this oscillation would continue until @xmath85 and the energy of the ground state atom would not change , i.e.  @xmath86 ( see blue dashed - dotted line in fig .  [",
    "fig - pot - trajec - energy]c ) .",
    "however , this situation is different in the quantum - classical treament ( see red solid line in fig.[fig - pot - trajec - energy]c ) : with each oscillation , i.e.  when @xmath87 , energy is transferred to the rydberg electron , and the ground state atom  loses energy .",
    "the total detuning is on the order of @xmath88khz per oscillation and , thus , very small compared to the binding energy of several mhz .",
    "the detuning per oscillation therefore remains almost constant with time , and from averaging eq .",
    "we obtain a mean detuning over time [ see eq . ] on the order of @xmath89khz/@xmath67s .      in this section",
    ", we compare the time development of the detuning with the experimental investigations of the lifetimes .",
    "we again consider a rydberg excitation of @xmath10 which has also been investigated in detailed experimental lifetime measurements by butscher  @xcite .",
    "corresponding to the lifetime of @xmath77rb rydberg molecules in the zero density limit .",

    "the shaded areas indicate the experimental error ( green horizontal stripe ) and the region of the energy detuning which is present in this regime ( blue vertical stripe ) .",
    "see text for further description . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig - extrapolation ] again shows the time development of the detuning ( red solid line ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have measured the lifetimes of the @xmath10 rydberg state for different densities @xmath5 of the atomic background gas and found that the lifetime decreases with increasing density @xmath5 .",
    "some of their results have been included in fig.[fig - extrapolation ] for comparison ( horizontal green dotted lines ) . as discussed in the introduction , they found a linear dependence of the decay rate on the density that indicates a @xmath7s lifetime of the rydberg molecule in the zero density limit ( horizontal green dashed line , the horizontal green stripe indicates the experimental error ) .",
    "in contrast to the expectation that , in this limit , one would obtain the lifetime @xmath91s of the bare atomic state ( horizontal orange dotted line ) , the extrapolated value is still significantly reduced by about 25% .    to determine whether or not the detuning of the rydberg state discussed above can play a role in reducing the lifetimes , we compare these two on the relevant time scale . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - extrapolation ] the detuning of the rydberg state reaches a value of @xmath92khz ( indicated by the vertical blue stripe ) within the extrapolated lifetime including the experimental error . comparing this detuning with the corresponding lorentzian profile of the vibrational ground state which has a linewidth of @xmath93khz",
    "( see top of fig .",
    "[ fig - extrapolation ] ) , we obtain that this corresponds to a detuning of @xmath94 .",
    "this value is in accordance with the above estimated detuning where the quantum mechanically `` forbidden region '' is reached , since for such a detuning the lorentzian curve has decreased to @xmath95 .",
    "the rydberg wave function is then strongly detuned which can result in a significantly higher probability for its decay than one would expect from spontaneous decay or blackbody induced radiation .",
    "therefore , we expect the lifetime of the rydberg molecule to be determined by the time necessary for the detuning to significantly exceed the natural linewidth of the molecule .    as already discussed above , we also expect this strongly detuned rydberg wave function to cause a change in the electronic structure ( e.g.  @xmath71 ) which , depending on the final state , may allow for different reactions , e.g.the dissociation of the rydberg molecule .",
    "this picture is supported by the quantum mechanical interpretation of the process : in the case of a fixed ground state atom@xcite , the scattering of a rydberg electron will , in general , change its direction , but not its energy .",
    "this means that the scattering process does not conserve the angular momentum but the principal quantum number ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "however , in the case of a ground state atom  with nonvanishing velocity ( @xmath87 ) , each scattering process causes a change of the rydberg electron s energy . for detunings which are small compared to the natural linewidth ,",
    "this is possible within the linewidth of the respective rydberg state @xmath0 .",
    "significant detunings on the order of the natural linewidth or even larger , however , are quantum mechanically related to couplings to other quantum states , i.e.  the strongly detuned rydberg state must , in general , be coupled to states with other principal quantum numbers @xmath0 .",
    "the coupling can induce transitions to lower electronic states resulting in the decay of the molecule , as already discussed above .",
    "detailed investigations of the lifetimes of rydberg molecules can only be found for the @xmath10 s - state in the literature so far @xcite .",
    "however , already in the publication on their first experimental realisation @xcite , a dependence of the lifetime on the principal quantum number @xmath0 has been discussed .",
    "although these experiments have been performed at finite densities @xmath5 and an extrapolation to zero density is not possible due to the lack of data , the measured tendency of longer lifetimes with increasing quantum number @xmath0 can also be expected to hold in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "we , therefore , present the behaviour of the rydberg electron s detuning for different @xmath0 in the following .    in order to determine the detuning for different quantum numbers @xmath0 ,",
    "we proceed as done for the @xmath10 state : we determine the molecular potential for the respective quantum number and place the point particle representing the ground state atom  in the outermost well with an energy corresponding to the respective vibrational ground state .",
    "the average energy detuning @xmath97 is calculated using eq .  .     in eq .",
    "on the principal quantum number @xmath0 .",
    "the calculations reveal a perfect exponential decrease of the detuning with the quantum number @xmath0 . ]",
    "[ fig - detuning ] shows this mean energy detuning over time for different experimentally accessible quantum numbers @xmath98 ( red squares ) .",
    "the figure illustrates that the value @xmath97 strongly depends on @xmath0 showing a significant decrease of the detuning with an increasing quantum number .",
    "two points contribute to this behaviour : ( i ) the extension of the rydberg electron s wave function scales with @xmath99 so that the atom becomes more extended with increasing @xmath0 . at the same time",
    "the larger extension results in a smaller electron density @xmath100 at the position of the ground state atom , which lowers the effect of the finite mass correction term in eq .  .",
    "( ii ) for higher principal quantum numbers , the outermost potential minimum becomes less deep so that the velocity of the ground state atomdecreases . because @xmath101 directly enters the correction term , its effect is further reduced .",
    "for the decrease of the detuning with increasing @xmath0 , we obtain a value of @xmath102 from fig .",
    "[ fig - detuning ] . assuming that  in analogy to the calculations for the @xmath10 s - state  the decay of the rydberg molecule was generally induced by the ground state atom  when a detuning of @xmath103khz is reached",
    ", this would mean an increase of the rydberg molecule s lifetime by a factor of @xmath104 . note that , considering the experimental error stripes presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , this value is in accordance with the lifetime measurements of the rydberg molecules by bendkowsky  at finite densities @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the vibrational ground state of rydberg molecules within a quantum - classical treatment . in this model",
    "the dynamics of the ground state atom  and the rydberg electron are coupled , leading to a continuous energy transfer from the ground state atom  to the rydberg electron by which the rydberg state is permanently detuned .",
    "comparing the time evolution of the detuning with these reduced lifetimes of the molecule , we observe that the measurements agree very well with the time at which the detuning significantly exceeds the natural linewidth . we , therefore , expect this detuning of the rydberg state to give an important contribution to the reduced lifetimes of rydberg molecules .",
    "also the experimentally measured tendency of longer lifetimes with higher rydberg excitation could be verified within this model . however , further detailed experimental investigations of the corresponding lifetimes need to be performed for different densities of the background atomic gas as well as different quantum numbers @xmath0 to verify the results also in the zero density limit of the atomic background gas",
