    "currently , there are approximately 130 known pulsars in globular clusters ( gcs)pfreire / gcpsr.html . ] , of which about 60% are observed to be in binary systems .",
    "roughly two thirds of all the pulsars known in gcs have been discovered in only the last seven years by surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using low - temperature receivers ( @xmath3k ) at central observing frequencies between @xmath42ghz , large bandwidth and high time and frequency - resolution backends ( e.g. the wideband arecibo pulsar processor , dowd , sisk , & hagen 2000 , and the gbt pulsar spigot , kaplan et al . 2005 ) , advanced search techniques for binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and copious amounts of processing time on dedicated computer clusters .",
    "though a few non - recycled pulsars have been found in gcs ( e.g. psr  b1718@xmath519 in ngc  6342 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , almost all known gc pulsars are msps .",
    "in fact , the 150 known gcs orbiting the milky way contain roughly three orders of magnitude more observed millisecond pulsars ( msps ) per unit mass than the galactic plane , which contains approximately 60 known msps .",
    "gcs have proven to be the most fruitful place to look for msps partly because of the enormous stellar densities in their cores , which exceed those in the galactic plane by up to six orders of magnitude .",
    "these conditions promote many different formation processes that create binary systems in which a neutron star can be spun - up , or `` recycled '' @xcite , through the accretion of matter from its companion star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* the most up - to - date general overview of pulsars in gcs , for a review of the formation and evolutionary processes at work in the cores of gcs ) .",
    "furthermore , the cores of gcs , where most of the msps reside , typically have radii less than an arcminute , small enough to be covered by a single telescope pointing .",
    "this affords the possibility of making single , deep multi - hour integrations for multiple faint msps in gcs , something that is not feasible in large area surveys of the field .",
    "some clusters contain many pulsars : terzan  5 and 47  tucanae harbor 33 and 22 known pulsars , respectively .",
    "together , they contain @xmath6% of the total known gc pulsar population @xcite .",
    "finding numerous pulsars in a single cluster allows interesting studies of the cluster itself , in addition to the individual pulsars contained therein .",
    "such studies have included the detection of intra - cluster ionized gas @xcite , high mass - to - light ratios @xcite , and hints at the cluster s dynamical history @xcite .",
    "however , many clusters still contain no known pulsars at all , despite sensitive searches @xcite . in some cases",
    ", this may simply be because pulsars are generally intrinsically weak objects and gcs are often distant ( approximately 90% of the gcs orbiting the milky way are @xmath7kpc from the sun ) .",
    "interstellar scattering , which broadens pulsations because of multi - path propagation , can also be a major obstacle , especially for msps in clusters at low galactic latitudes . at low radio frequencies ( @xmath8mhz )",
    ", scattering can completely wash out the signal of fast - spinning pulsars .    while gcs are clearly the most profitable targets for finding msps , these searches remain non - trivial .",
    "first , the requisite short sampling times ( @xmath9@xmath10s ) , high frequency resolution ( @xmath11mhz channels ) , long integrations ( few hours ) , and large bandwidth ( @xmath12mhz ) of these data can make data acquisition and storage formidable ( data rates @xmath13100gb / hr ) .",
    "recent surveys with relatively good sensitivity to binary pulsars have revealed that the majority of gc msps are in binaries .",
    "the pulsed signal from these binary pulsars is smeared in fourier space by their orbital motion , and thus even a bright pulsar can go undetected if nothing is done to correct for this modulation over the course of a long observation .",
    "advanced and computationally intensive techniques , which partially search orbital parameter space , are required to recover the majority of the lost signal . the extra effort required to find binaries",
    "is well justified however , as some of the most exotic pulsar binaries known have been found in gcs .",
    "for instance , psr  b1620@xmath526 in the cluster m4 is in a hierarchical triple system with a white dwarf and a 1@xmath53@xmath14 planet , the only planet known in a gc @xcite ; psr  j0514@xmath54002 in ngc  1851 , with an eccentricity of 0.89 , is one of the most eccentric binary pulsars known @xcite ; psr  b2127 + 11c in m15 is a rare double neutron star binary @xcite ; psr  j1748@xmath52446ad  in terzan  5 is the fastest - spinning neutron star known @xcite ; and a few msps with possible main - sequence companions have been found ( e.g. psr  j1740@xmath55340 , * ? ? ?",
    "* similar systems have not been found in the galactic plane ) .",
    "other exotic binaries , perhaps even an msp - msp binary or a msp - black - hole binary , may have effective formation channels only in gcs ( but see * ? ? ?",

    "the sample of 22 gcs is listed in table  [ gcs.tab ] , along with basic and derived cluster parameters ( * ? ? ? * unless otherwise indicated , all gc quantities used in this paper are from the 2003 february revision of the catalog ) .",
    "the numbers of known isolated and binary pulsars in each cluster are indicated , with figures in parentheses denoting the number of pulsars found by this survey . for clusters containing known pulsars , the average dispersion measure ( dm ) of the pulsars",

    "each cluster was observed at least twice for the full time it is visible with arecibo ( table  [ gcs.tab ] ) .",
    "the clusters were observed in one of two campaigns in the summers of 2001 and 2002 using the gregorian l - band wide receiver ( @xmath18k ) .",
    "depending on the known or predicted dm of the cluster , the central observing frequency was either 1175mhz ( dm @xmath19pc @xmath20 ) or 1475mhz ( dm @xmath21pc @xmath20 ) .",
    "our observations were made using the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp , see * ? ? ? * for details ) , a digital auto - correlator with configurable sampling time ( 3 or 9-level samples ) and number of lags .",
    "generally , 3-level samples were autocorrelated with 256 lags , accumulated every 64-@xmath10s , and summed in polarization before being written to the wapp disk array as 16-bit numbers .",
    "for the few clusters with known or predicted dms greater than 100pc @xmath20 , we used 128-@xmath10s sampling and 512 lags .",
    "these configurations were chosen in order to minimize dispersive pulse smearing and to take full advantage of the wapp s maximum sustainable data rate at the time of the observations ( 8mb / s , or @xmath22gb / hr ) .",
    "data were transferred to dlt magnetic tape for offline analysis and archiving .",
    "these observations resulted in about 4 tb of data on about 100 tapes .    at the time of our original cluster search observations , only one wapp backend was available , providing 100mhz of bandwidth . in more recent observations of m3 , m5 , m13 , m71 , and",
    "ngc  6749 ( after december 2002 ) , which were made as part of the timing observations of the new discoveries , we used three of the four available wapp backends , each with 100mhz of bandwidth centered at 1170 , 1420 and 1520mhz .",
    "the frequency gap between the lower and upper bands was to avoid persistent and intense radio frequency interference ( rfi ) in the frequency ranges 1220@xmath51360mhz and @xmath23mhz . using the prestosransom / presto . ]",
    "pulsar software suite , these data were partially dedispersed into a reduced number of subbands ( generally 16 or 32 subbands ) at the average dm of the cluster pulsars before further timing or search analysis .",
    "this process affords an order - of - magnitude reduction in data size ( enabling transfer of these data over the internet from puerto rico to canada ) , while still providing the possibility of creating dedispersed time series at a variety of dms around the average dm of the cluster .",
    "these data were also searched for new pulsars , in the manner described in  3 .",
    "we can estimate the typical minimum flux density to which our searches were sensitive , as a function of the radiometer noise and observed pulsar duty cycle , using the equation @xmath24 ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a search candidate is indicated by @xmath25 , and is taken to be 10 here ( although when candidate lists were short , due to a lack of rfi , we investigated candidates below this threshold ) .",
    "@xmath26 is a factor that incorporates both losses due to the 3-level quantization of the signal and other systemic effects .",
    "zero lag and van vleck corrections ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have been applied to our data .",

    "@xmath29 is the telescope gain , which is a function of zenith angle , and is taken to have an average value of 10.5k / jy . for clusters that are only visible at zenith angles",
    "@xmath30 , the gain ( and hence the sensitivity ) is reduced by 5@xmath515% .",
    "this is the case for the clusters which are closest to the declination limit of the arecibo - visible sky : m2 , m5 , m13 , pal  5 , pal  15 , ngc  6535 , ngc  6749 , and ngc  6760 .",
    "@xmath31 is the number of orthogonal polarizations that have been summed ( @xmath32 here ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the bandwidth of the backend , taken to be 100mhz here . for clusters where subsequent timing observations were also performed ( m3 , m5 , m13 , m71 , and ngc  6749 )",
    ", we were able to search a larger bandwidth ( @xmath34mhz ) by combining multiple wapps .",
    "@xmath35 is the integration time , which varies between clusters from 0.6@xmath52.8hr depending on the declination of the source , but is set to 2hr for the purposes of these sensitivity calculations .",
    "@xmath36 is the observed pulse width , which is a function of the intrinsic pulse width @xmath37 and other effects that smear the observed pulse profile ( equation  [ obswidth.eqn ] ) .",
    "@xmath38 is the pulsar spin period .",
    "when the dm of a cluster is not known , one must construct hundreds of trial time series at a wide range of dms , each of which must be searched . even for clusters with known dms ,",
    "the pulsars have a spread in dm , @xmath39 , and several trial dms must be searched in order to maintain maximum sensitivity .",
    "@xmath39 increases roughly linearly with dm , and typically @xmath40 is a few percent @xcite .",
    "the observed pulse width , @xmath36 in equation  [ sens.eqn ] , is always equal to or larger than the pulsar s intrinsic pulse width @xmath41 . broadening is due to the finite time sampling of the data recorder , @xmath42 , dispersive smearing across individual frequency channels , @xmath43 , smearing due to the deviation of a pulsar s true dm from the nominal dm of the time series used for searching or folding , @xmath44 , and interstellar scattering , @xmath45 .",
    "one can express the observed width as the sum in quadrature of these terms :    @xmath46    where the dispersive smearing ( assuming the channel bandwidth @xmath47 ) across an individual channel is given by    @xmath48    the smearing due to an incorrect dm in the time series is    @xmath49 \\left(\\frac{\\delta{\\rm dm}}{{\\rm pc~cm^{-3}}}\\right){\\rm ms},\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the low and high frequency edges of the bandwidth respectively ) , and the scattering ( @xmath52 is in ms ) can be estimated by the empirical formula @xcite    @xmath53    for these data at 1.4ghz , @xmath54120@xmath10s for dms 25@xmath5200pc @xmath20 ( using @xmath55 = 100/256mhz for dm @xmath56pc @xmath20 and @xmath55 = 100/512mhz for dm @xmath57pc @xmath20 ) . in searches where the cluster dm was not known , we created dedispersed time series with dms spaced by 1.0pc @xmath20 . for clusters with known dms , we typically used a spacing of 0.5pc @xmath20 or finer .",
    "hence , the maximum dm deviation between a pulsar s true dm and that assumed in making the trial time series is 0.5pc @xmath20 , resulting in a maximum smearing @xmath58@xmath10s .",
    "we have estimated @xmath45 using equation  [ scatt.eqn ] @xcite , which predicts the scattering time based on the known ( or predicted ) dm and the observing frequency .",
    "@xmath45 varies from source to source , but given the relatively high observing frequency of these data and the high galactic latitudes of most of the sources observed here ( most of which have relatively low known or predicted dms ) , it does not significantly increase the smearing already present in the data .",
    "figure  [ sensitivity.fig ] shows the search sensitivity determined from equations  1@xmath55 as a function of dm and period .",
    "we compare the sensitivity of our survey with that of the only other major survey of these clusters with arecibo @xcite .",
    "as the @xcite survey was conducted at 430mhz , we use a typical pulsar spectral index of @xmath59 @xcite as well as a flatter spectral index of @xmath60 to scale that survey to 1400mhz , so that the sensitivities of both surveys can be more directly compared . ,",
    "of @xmath61 .",
    "it has been shown by a number of authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the mean spectral indices of msps and un - recycled pulsars are consistent with each other .",
    "though radio pulsars , both msps and un - recycled , generally have steep , power - law spectra , the observed range of spectral indices in the pulsar population is large : @xmath62 . ] for low - dm pulsars with spin periods @xmath63ms and a standard spectral index ( @xmath64 ) , the @xcite survey had a similar sensitivity to ours . however , for pulsars spinning faster than this , especially those at high dms and with relatively flat spectral indices , our survey provides a significant increase in sensitivity .",
    "for example , we were roughly 3@xmath56 times more sensitive to a 2-ms pulsar at a dm of 100pc @xmath20 , assuming @xmath65 .",
    "our searches are likely the deepest searches for gc pulsars yet undertaken .",
    "though recent searches with parkes ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ) and gbt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) benefit from larger recordable bandwidth and longer possible source tracking times , arecibo s much larger gain still more than compensates for these ( table  [ surveys_comp.tab ] ) . comparing raw gains , maximum tracking times , and recordable bandwidths , simple scaling using equation 1 and a spectral index of @xmath59 to compare different observing frequencies , shows that , with the currently available data - recorders , arecibo has a raw sensitivity @xmath66 greater than parkes and @xmath67 greater than the gbt for an isolated pulsar . for binary pulsars , where blind search sensitivity does nt improve as @xmath68 ( see  3.2 and 5.1.1 . ) , and longer tracking times provide less benefit , arecibo is more sensitive by an additional factor of roughly 2 .",
    "periodicities due to terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) can swamp search candidate lists .",
    "ultimately this reduces a survey s sensitivity by increasing the number of false positives .",
    "first , strong bursts of interference , principally from airport and military radars , were removed in the time domain by clipping samples found to be further than 6@xmath25 from the mean in the @xmath69pc @xmath20 time series .",
    "secondly , we created time - frequency masks and applied them to all data before searching .",
    "these masks remove certain channels during specific time intervals when either the maximum fourier power , standard deviation , or mean of the data surpass statistically determined thresholds .",
    "this method was very useful at excising strong narrow - band and transient rfi from the data before searching and typically only @xmath70% of the data were masked .",
    "lastly , we removed known `` birdies '' ( weak but highly periodic broadband interference and bright known pulsars ) from the power spectrum by setting the powers in these narrow frequency intervals to zero .",
    "we found that using these techniques and observing in the relatively rfi - clean frequency ranges of 1120@xmath51220mhz and 1370@xmath51570mhz kept the size of our candidate lists manageable , while minimizing the risk of rejecting potentially interesting candidates .      in a standard fourier - based search , which identifies pulsar harmonics above a certain threshold , binary pulsars",
    "are strongly selected against because of orbital modulation , which smears the signal power over many bins in frequency space .",
    "as the majority of msps in gcs are in binary systems , sometimes with orbital periods comparable to or shorter than the observation length , it is crucial to use more sophisticated techniques .",
    "our primary search method is a fourier - based matched filtering technique @xcite which assumes that the pulsar s orbit can be described by a constant acceleration ( i.e. constant frequency derivative ) over the course of the observation .",
    "this technique is a frequency - domain version of a previously used constant acceleration technique @xcite in which the time series is quadratically stretched or compressed before it is fourier transformed , in order to simulate different accelerations .",
    "the advantage of the fourier - based technique used here is that it is computationally more efficient than the equivalent time - domain - based method , and provides even sampling of frequency derivative space .",
    "this method is typically most sensitive to binaries where the orbital period is @xmath71 the integration time of the observation , although very bright pulsars with orbital periods much shorter than this can often be detected @xcite .",
    "as our arecibo observations were typically from 1@xmath52.5hr in length , for full tracks this search method is most sensitive to orbital periods @xmath7225hr . using the same technique",
    ", we also searched overlapping subsections of the data sets ( which were typically about one third the total observation length ) , in order to be sensitive to larger accelerations and tighter binaries ( @xmath7310hr ) , as well as eclipsing systems .    to search for binaries with orbital periods a factor of @xmath74 or more shorter than the observation time",
    ", we used a `` phase modulation '' search @xcite .",
    "this method makes use of the change in phase of the pulsations from a binary pulsar and the `` comb '' pattern created by such a signal in the fourier power spectrum . by taking fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) of short subsections of the power spectrum from the full observation",
    ", one can detect the sidebands , which are evenly spaced at the orbital period and centered on the true frequency of the pulsar .",
    "this method is appropriate for binary pulsars with orbital periods less than half the observation length , and increases in sensitivity as the ratio @xmath75 increases . given the 1@xmath52.5hr integration times used in this survey , this technique was sensitive to an area of orbital parameter space in which no binary radio msps have yet been observed .",
    "here we summarize the data analysis pipeline applied to the observations of each cluster .",
    "the routines used in the pipeline are part of the presto pulsar search and analysis package .",
    "first , we generated an rfi mask from the raw data ( as described in  3.1 ) . applying this mask , a dm = 0pc @xmath20 , topocentric time series was created and the corresponding power spectrum was examined by eye for periodic interference .",
    "we added the worst of the interference to the `` birdie list '' of frequency intervals to be subsequently removed from the fourier transform . again applying the rfi mask , we then dedispersed the data at a number of trial dms using dm steps @xmath76pc @xmath20 , clipping samples found to be greater than 6@xmath25 from the mean in the dm = 0pc @xmath20 time series .",
    "the time series were transformed to the solar - system barycenter during dedispersion , which allowed us to compare directly candidate periods from separate observations .",
    "this was very useful for distinguishing likely pulsar periodicities from the rfi background , which can vary greatly between observations . for clusters with known pulsars , we dedispersed at a range of trial dms equal to at least 10% of the cluster s average dm . for clusters with no known pulsars ,",
    "we created time series at a range of dms centered around the predicted dm of the cluster @xcite , given its galactic coordinates and distance in the @xcite catalog .",
    "we assumed at least a 100% error in the predicted dm value when choosing a dm search range .",
    "for example , for a cluster with a predicted dm of 100pc @xmath20 , we searched dedispersed time series with @xmath77200pc @xmath20 .",
    "the dedispersion and subsequent analysis of the time series was conducted in parallel using multiple processors on a 52-node dual - processor linux cluster called `` the borg '' , located at mcgill university and constructed by our group specifically for pulsar searches .",
    "once the dedispersion was complete , the time series were fourier - transformed .",
    "our analysis did not restrict the number of samples in the time series to be a power of two .. ] we then set the frequency intervals of the birdie list to zero in the power spectra before searching the power spectra with both the phase - modulation and matched - filtering techniques described in  3.2 .    as most pulsars have relatively short duty cycles , with spectral power divided between numerous harmonics , we summed harmonics in our matched - filter search to increase sensitivity to such signals .",
    "for each candidate signal , sums of 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 harmonics were tried and the optimum combination was determined . in these searches , we looked for signals where the highest of the harmonics used in summing drifted by up to @xmath78 = 170 bins in the fourier domain .",
    "higher order harmonics will drift by @xmath79 times more bins than the fundamental , where @xmath80 for the fundamental , @xmath81 for the second harmonic , etc .",
    "if , for example , 8 harmonics were summed in the identification of a particular candidate period , then the maximum number of bins the fundamental could drift by during the observation and still be detectable by our search would be 170/8 .",
    "conversely , for signals where the fundamental drifted by more than 170/2 bins during the observation , we were sensitive to at most one harmonic .",
    "the maximum number of bins a signal is allowed to drift corresponds to a maximum line - of - sight acceleration of @xmath82 m s@xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the spin period in milliseconds and the observation time in hours and @xmath79 is the highest order harmonic used in summing .",
    "overlapping subsections of the observation , corresponding to about a third of the total observation length , were also searched using the matched - filtering technique and @xmath78 = 170 bins , in order to look for more highly accelerated pulsars .",
    "the resulting candidate lists from the matched - filtering search were generally short enough that they could easily be examined by eye , although we also parsed candidate lists with a script that automatically folded candidates above an equivalent gaussian significance threshold of 7 .",
    "interesting candidates were folded using the estimated dm , period , and period derivative from the search and these parameters were optimized by the folding software to maximize the s / n ratio of the folded profile .",
    "the output plot from such a fold was used to determine whether a given candidate warranted further attention ( see sample discovery plot and description in figure  [ discplot.fig ] ) . to identify potentially interesting candidates from the phase - modulation searches ,",
    "we compared the search outputs from the different observing epochs of each cluster .",
    "the criteria for a promising phase - modulation candidate was a signal with a significance @xmath86 that did not peak in significance at dm @xmath87pc @xmath20 , had an orbital period @xmath88s , and appeared , by virtue of a similar orbital period , in the candidate lists of at least two observing epochs .",
    "table  [ prev_pulsars.tab ] lists the 15 previously known pulsars in our survey clusters .",
    "the majority of these pulsars were easily detected by our search pipeline ( table  [ prev_pulsars.tab ] ) .",
    "in fact , because many of these sources are relatively bright , masking these periodicities and their many significant harmonics was an important factor in reducing the length of candidate lists .",
    "the only previously known pulsars not detected in our searches are m15f , g , and h. although these are all isolated pulsars , and are well within the @xmath89 half - power radius of the 1.4-ghz arecibo main beam , our non - detections are not very surprising : these are the dimmest pulsars in m15 , and were all found in searches of multiple , combined observing epochs @xcite . assuming standard spectral indices ( @xmath64 )",
    ", they have flux densities right at the limit of our search sensitivity .      we have discovered 11 msps and 2 promising candidates in 5 clusters .",
    "three of the clusters with new pulsars ( m3 , m71 , and ngc  6749 ) contained no known pulsars prior to our survey .",
    "all of the pulsars discovered in this survey were found using the matched - filtering acceleration search technique , and all but the newly - found isolated pulsar m13c ( psr  j1641 + 3627c ) and the long - orbital - period binary m3d ( psr  j1342 + 2822d ) required a non - zero trial frequency derivative ( acceleration ) in order to be detectable .",
    "given the criteria outlined in  3.3 , no interesting candidates were identified by the phase - modulation search .",

    "the fastest - spinning pulsar known in these clusters prior to this survey is m13b , with a spin period of 3.5ms .",

    "these simulations assume a pulsar spin period of 2ms and a companion mass of 0.1_@xmath92 .",
    "we see that for a 2-hr binary period and a 0.5-hr observation duration that the sensitivity afforded by an acceleration search is roughly half that of the coherent sensitivity .",

    "for these clusters , we were sensitive to even more compact systems and higher accelerations ( assuming the pulsar s flux is high enough to show up in such short integrations ) .",
    "as explained in  3.3 , in our matched - filter acceleration technique we looked for signals where the highest order harmonic used in summing drifted by up to @xmath147 bins , corresponding to a maximum line - of - sight acceleration of @xmath148 m s@xmath83 . for comparison",
    ", we note that @xcite were sensitive to a maximum acceleration of @xmath149 m s@xmath83 in their searches of 47  tucanae ( where 0.3-h integration subsections were used ) and that psr  b1744@xmath524a in terzan  5 has a maximum line - of - sight acceleration of 33 m s@xmath83 @xcite . for @xmath150ms and @xmath151h , which is typical of the integration times used in our short - subsection searches , we reach a limiting acceleration of 32 m s@xmath83 ( note however that this limit applies only to the fundamental and not to sums including higher - order harmonics ) . for clusters where we searched numerous timing observations ,",
    "@xmath152 bins was sometimes used , providing an additional factor of three range in acceleration space .",
    "such high accelerations are worth exploring in order to maintain sensitivity to not only the accelerated fundamental of a pulsar signal but also its harmonics , which are needed to detect faint pulsars . though no new pulsars were found in these searches , we note that the pulsars m13e and m71a were only detected with @xmath153 harmonics in our initial @xmath154 searches and would have been more easily identified in a @xmath155 search .",
    "re - searching the data presented here with @xmath156 has the potential to discover compact binaries that were previously missed .",

    "because of their large distances , such weak pulsars are not excluded in any of the clusters we have searched here . for most of our clusters ,",

    "roughly 90% are at @xmath167 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "only one of our clusters , m15 , has such a high density , and thus we do not a priori expect that such sources exist in our other survey clusters .",
    "the radius of the arecibo beam at 1.4ghz is roughly @xmath171 .",
    "thus , for the 12 clusters we surveyed with @xmath172 , almost all of the cluster s pulsars should have fallen within our beam . furthermore ,",
    "the beam radius of the 430-mhz @xcite survey , which observed 11 of the same sources ( see table  [ gcs.tab ] ) , was @xmath173 , and would likely have detected some sources further from the cluster centers , if they existed . for the 6 clusters we surveyed with @xmath174 , the coverage was still very good , though perhaps 20% of the pulsar population fell outside the arecibo beam .",
    "there remain 4 survey clusters whose @xmath168 is comparable to the beam half - power radius or larger : ngc  5053 ( @xmath175 ) , ngc  5466 ( @xmath176 ) , pal  5 ( @xmath177 ) , and pal  15 ( @xmath178 ) . in these clusters ,",
    "perhaps only half of the pulsar population fell within the arecibo beam .",
    "in general however , we conclude that it is unlikely that a significant number of pulsars were missed in this survey because of spatial coverage .",
    "if one includes both the known msps in the field and those in gcs , the _ observed _ distribution of radio pulsar spin frequencies above 200hz roughly follows a power - law relationship with an index of @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath180 ( figure  [ spinfdist.fig ] , right ) .",
    "we do not suggest that the underlying spin - frequency distribution is a power - law , or that a physical motivation for this choice exists , we merely use this functional form to quantify the sharp observed drop in the number of known pulsars as @xmath181 increases . considering the combined spin frequencies of msps in the field and in gcs",
    "is potentially problematic , as the frequency distributions of msps in the field and those in gcs could well be intrinsically different . furthermore , the spin - frequency distribution between gc msp populations may also vary ( e.g. there is some indication that terzan  5 has a wider range of spin frequencies than 47  tucanae ) .",
    "nonetheless , for the purposes of discussing the effect of observational bias on the observed spin frequency distribution , we will consider the msp population as a whole .",
    "there is no significant correlation currently observed between the radio luminosity of msps and their spin frequency . because all other conceivable observational biases ( e.g. scattering , dispersive smearing , self - obscuration ) _ increase _ the difficulty in detecting the fastest pulsars , the observed spin - frequency distribution above 200hz places a limit on the steepness of the intrinsic spin frequency distribution at these frequencies ( i.e. if @xmath182 , then @xmath183 ) .",
    "we now consider the observational biases that contribute to the observed spin - frequency distribution of msps .",
    "first , we see from equation  [ sens.eqn ] that the minimum detectable flux density depends on spin frequency because pulse smearing due to scattering and dm has a greater relative effect for fast pulsars .",
    "this accounts for part of the slope in the observed spin - frequency distribution .",
    "second , as there is no indication that orbital period is strongly correlated with spin frequency , it is unlikely that many of the fastest msps are being missed because they are preferentially in the most compact orbits . however , the number of bins through which a binary - modulated pulsar signal will drift in the fourier domain is directly proportional to its spin frequency . in other words , for the same orbital period , it is more difficult to detect a 1-ms pulsar than a 5-ms pulsar in an acceleration search , because the 1-ms pulsar ( and its harmonics ) will drift by a factor of 5 times more fourier bins .",
    "harmonics that drift by many bins are more susceptible to non - linear frequency drift terms ( reducing their detectability ) and may drift beyond the maximum number of bins probed by the search ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , binary motion also accounts for part of the slope in the observed spin - frequency distribution , although this effect is difficult to quantify . finally ,",
    "because it is plausible that eclipse fraction increases with @xmath184 ( assuming that the pulsar spindown is dominated by magnetic dipole radiation ) , fast - spinning pulsars in binary systems may be preferentially obscured by the material their strong winds ablate from their companions @xcite .",
    "given the multitude of observational biases against detecting the fastest - spinning radio pulsars , it is difficult to identify what portion of the observed spin - frequency distribution is instrinsic to the population . perhaps the best way to investigate this problem is by performing monte carlo simulations of various trial underlying populations and then searching these until one converges on the observed population .",
    "terzan  5 and 47  tucanae present excellent samples on which to perform such simulations , although one would have to be careful in generalizing the results to msps in the field or in other gcs .",
    "if the distribution of radio pulsar spin frequencies is even approximately like that of the lmxbs , which is roughly consistent with being flat over the observed range of 270@xmath5619hz @xcite , then we have still only discovered a very small fraction of the fastest - spinning radio pulsars .",
    "mapping the distribution at the fastest spin frequencies depends crucially on finding these pulsars .      in table",
    "[ pulsars.tab ] , we list the 1.4-ghz flux densities of the pulsars discovered in this survey , as well as those of the previously known pulsars in these clusters .",
    "these were derived from the observed pulse profiles by integrating the pulse and scaling this flux using the off - pulse root mean square and the radiometer equation . for the mostly non - scintillating pulsars m71a and ngc  6749a",
    ", we estimate that the fractional uncertainty on their flux is roughly 30% . for the pulsars found in m3 , m5 , and m13",
    ", scintillation can have a strong effect on the observed flux of the pulsars as a function of time , making it more difficult to estimate the underlying intrinsic brightness of these sources .",
    "for these pulsars , we have used an approach similar to that used by @xcite : we fit the observed fluxes  using half the survey sensitivity limit as the flux in the case of non - detections  to an exponential distribution , whose median value we take as the intrinsic flux .",
    "this approach worked well for many of the scintillating pulsars in m3 , m5 , and m13 , which were detected in the majority of our many ( @xmath185 ) timing observations of these clusters . for these pulsars , we estimate that the fractional uncertainty on their quoted flux density is 50% .",
    "the exceptions were m3a , m5e , and m13e , where the scarcity of detections made determining the intrinsic flux density more uncertain .",
    "the quoted flux densities of these sources have a higher fractional uncertainty of roughly 70% .",
    "the luminosity distribution of msps , both in the field and in gcs , has been difficult to constrain precisely because of the relatively small number of known msps and the observational biases against finding faint , fast , and binary pulsars .",
    "furthermore , individual estimates of pulsar luminosity can suffer from large systematic errors because the distance is incorrect .",
    "this is especially difficult in the field , where most distances are estimated from the dm , but is less of an issue for pulsars associated with gcs , whose distances are known comparatively precisely . in this section , we take advantage of the many new pulsar discoveries that have been recently made in gcs .",
    "we combine the luminosities of the pulsars currently known in m5 , m13 , m15 , m28 , ngc  6440 , ngc  6441 , 47  tucanae , and terzan  5 ( see table  [ lum_sample.tab ] ) and consider the resulting luminosity distribution of gc msps .",
    "these specific gcs were chosen because they contain at least 4 pulsars each .",
    "the clusters m3 , m62 , ngc  6624 , and ngc  6752 , which are the only other clusters with at least 4 known pulsars , were excluded from the analysis because reliable fluxes were not available for all the known pulsars in these clusters .    in figure",
    "[ luminosities.fig ] , we plot the 1.4-ghz cumulative luminosity distribution of 41 isolated ( top left ) , 41 binary ( top right ) , and all 82 pulsars in our sample combined ( bottom ) . in the majority of cases , specific spectral indices were not available , and",
    "luminosities were scaled to 1.4ghz ( where necessary ) assuming a pulsar spectral index of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , the @xcite catalog distance to the host gc was used to convert 1400-mhz flux density @xmath186 to pseudo luminosity @xmath187 ( see table  [ lum_sample.tab ] ) .",
    "the m5 and m13 luminosities are from the observations made in this survey .",
    "the terzan  5 luminosities come from @xcite and subsequent analysis of the more recently found pulsars in this cluster .",
    "we assumed a distance of 8.7kpc to terzan  5 @xcite .",
    "the 47  tucanae fluxes are from @xcite and we use a distance of 4.5kpc @xcite to convert these to luminosities .",
    "the luminosities of pulsars in m28 , ngc  6440 , and ngc  6441 come from recent 1950-mhz discoveries and timing observations made by our group with the gbt ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* these discoveries are currently being prepared for publication as bgin et al . and freire et al . ) .",
    "we fit @xmath188 versus @xmath189 to a line , using the square - root of @xmath188 as the uncertainties .",
    "these best - fit slopes are shown as solid lines in figure  [ luminosities.fig ] .",
    "no corrections have been made for any observational bias ( as has been done for field msps in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for all isolated and binary pulsars combined , the best - fit slope is @xmath190 .",
    "below @xmath140mjy kpc@xmath162 the observed distribution turns over , and thus we used a minimum luminosity cut - off of @xmath191mjy kpc@xmath162 for fitting purposes . only the 70 pulsars in our sample above this luminosity limit were included in the fit . in combining luminosities from numerous clusters , we have assumed that the luminosity function does not vary significantly between clusters .",
    "we note that , when the same analysis is applied separately to the pulsar populations of the individual gcs in our sample , the slope is in each case consistent with that derived from all clusters in our sample combined ( though the error on the slope is of course large for clusters with few known pulsars ) .",
    "this supports the assumption that the radio luminosity distribution of gc pulsars is universal . as 40% of the sample pulsars",
    "are in terzan  5 , it is important to ask how much the assumed distance to the cluster affects the combined luminosity distribution .",
    "we find that the distance to terzan  5 can change by up to 30%kpc from @xcite . ] without significantly altering the slope derived from all the different cluster pulsars combined .",
    "furthermore , 56% of the pulsars in our sample are contained in either terzan  5 or 47  tuc .",
    "these two clusters thus have a large influence on the derived luminosity law , and it will be important to revisit these calculations when larger pulsar populations are known in other clusters as well .",
    "there are clearly ripples in the combined distribution , suggesting unmodeled effects , possibly due entirely to observational biases .",
    "when the population is separated into isolated and binary pulsars , it is clear that these effects come predominantly from the binary pulsars .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , as the observational biases inherent in detecting such systems are significantly higher than for the isolated pulsars .",
    "considering only the 37 isolated pulsars in our sample above @xmath192 , we find a much smoother distribution , with a best - fit slope @xmath193 .",
    "conversely , the cumulative distribution of the 33 binaries above @xmath194 is relatively poorly fit by a single slope of @xmath195 .",
    "we note that while the slope derived by fitting the isolated pulsars is relativity insensitive to the value of @xmath192 ( as long as it is not well below @xmath140mjy kpc@xmath162 ) , the slope derived from the binary pulsars varies significantly as @xmath192 is changed .",
    "given the much lower bias against detecting isolated pulsars , we suggest that the slope derived from fitting only isolated pulsars is the most reliable .",
    "this distribution is somewhat flatter , though still barely consistent with the d @xmath196 = @xmath5 d @xmath189 relation found for non - recycled field pulsars and msps ( consider for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also roughly consistent with the recently derived luminosity law of @xcite , who find d @xmath197 d @xmath189 using a sample of 1008 normal ( non - millisecond ) pulsars . as the population of known gc msps continues to increase",
    ", we will be better able to constrain the luminosity distribution .",
    "however , until the next large advance in telescope collecting area , it will be hard to constrain the luminosity function of gc msps below 1mjy kpc@xmath162 , because of the relatively large distances to gcs and selection effects , which are worse for weak pulsars .",
    "we note that 70% of our sample pulsars , those in m15 , m28 , ngc  6440 , ngc  6441 , and terzan  5 , can be characterized as not strongly scintillating ( table  [ lum_sample.tab ] ) .",
    "thus , as the majority of the pulsars in the sample do nt scintillate significantly , and those that do have been given special attention , we do nt believe that scintillation is strongly biasing our distribution .",
    "when we consider only the 31 not strongly scintillating , isolated pulsars above our luminosity cutoff , we find a best - fit slope of @xmath198 , consistent with that derived from all our isolated sample pulsars .",
    "we note further that since the known msps in the plane have mostly very low dms ( @xmath199% have dm@xmath200pc @xmath20 ) and are observed for shorter amounts of time ( which means less averaging over strong scintillation epochs ) , scintillation is potentially a larger pitfall in analyzing the luminosities of those sources .",
    "as the flux densities used in this analysis were obtained at either 0.43ghz , 1.4ghz , or 2.0ghz ( see table  [ lum_sample.tab ] ) we have also investigated the uncertainty introduced by the error on the mean spectral index used to scale these fluxes .",
    "the nominal error on the @xmath59 mean spectral index we have used is 0.2 @xcite .",
    "we have re - run our fitting of isolated pulsars using a spectral index of -1.6 and -2.0 and find slopes of @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively for isolated pulsars .",
    "thus , uncertainty in the average spectral index of these pulsars does not have a large effect on the derived luminosity distribution .",
    "lastly , we have statistically compared the luminosity distributions of isolated and binary gc pulsars , using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the two populations are statistically different with only 34% confidence .",
    "in other words , there is currently no evidence that the observed luminosity distributions of isolated and binary gc pulsars are significantly different .",
    "this can also be seen by plotting the best - fit slope from the distribution of isolated gc pulsars over the distribution of binaries ( dashed - line in figure  [ luminosities.fig ] , top right ) .",
    "this lack of difference has also been recently demonstrated for the msps in the galactic plane by @xcite , who argue that previous claims @xcite of a statistical difference between the luminosities of the two populations were due to small number statistics and observational biases .",
    "we have used the arecibo radio telescope at @xmath0ghz to search 22 gcs for pulsars .",
    "these searches are among the deepest searches ever undertaken for such objects , and employed the most sensitive algorithms available to find doppler - shifted binary pulsar signals .",
    "our survey discovered 11 msps , almost doubling the known population in these gcs .",
    "8 of these new pulsars are in binary systems , and 3 show eclipses .",
    "we find a significantly higher proportion of binaries , eclipsing systems , and pulsars with very short spin periods ( @xmath16ms ) than previous searches of these clusters .",
    "we consider the luminosity distribution of gc pulsars and find that these follow a form d @xmath196 = @xmath193 d @xmath203 .",

    "<S> we have surveyed all 22 known galactic globular clusters observable with the arecibo radio telescope and within 70kpc of the sun for radio pulsations at @xmath0ghz . </S>",
    "<S> data were taken with the wideband arecibo pulsar processor , which provided the large bandwidth and high time and frequency resolution needed to detect fast - spinning , faint pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we have also employed advanced search techniques to maintain sensitivity to short orbital period binaries . </S>",
    "<S> these searches have discovered 11 new millisecond pulsars and 2 promising candidates in 5 clusters , almost doubling the population of pulsars in the arecibo - visible globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> ten of these new pulsars are in binary systems , and 3 are eclipsing . this survey has discovered significantly more very fast - spinning pulsars ( @xmath1ms ) and short orbital period systems ( @xmath2hr ) than previous surveys of the same clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some properties of these systems , as well as some characteristics of the globular cluster pulsar population in general , particularly its luminosity distribution . </S>"
