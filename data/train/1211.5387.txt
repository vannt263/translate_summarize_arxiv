    "over the past few decades , the boom in x - ray and gamma - ray astronomy has led to a significant increase in our knowledge about the neutron star family .",
    "previously , the only kind of isolated neutron stars known were radio pulsars .",
    "the latter are also known as ` rotation - powered pulsars ' ( rpps ) because their luminosities are generally much lower than @xmath5 , the rate of energy loss due to rotation . since then",
    ", x - ray observations have led to the discovery of several new classes of isolated neutron stars , including magnetars and x - ray - isolated neutron stars ( xinss ) ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "all of these classes exhibit properties different from those of conventional rpps .",
    "magnetars , including the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , are isolated , slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "the known objects have spin periods in the range of 212s , x - ray luminosities that are in many cases much higher than their spin - down luminosities , and , assuming conventional magnetic dipole braking , typically very high magnetic fields @xmath6 .",
    "it is generally believed that their x - ray luminosities are fueled by the decay of these high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "magnetars also show great x - ray variability and activity , ranging from short sgr - like x - ray/@xmath7-ray bursts to major , slow - rise and long - lived x - ray flares , that are thought to be produced by fracturing of the crust and reconfiguration of the magnetic field lines . for reviews of magnetars ,",
    "see for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the xinss ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) are a group of nearby ( distance @xmath8pc ) neutron stars characterized by soft thermal x - ray spectra and no detected radio emission .",
    "those xinss with detailed timing measurements have spin periods in the range of 311s , high inferred magnetic fields @xmath9 , and characteristic ages of @xmath10@xmath11yr @xcite .",
    "the xinss are considerably hotter and more x - ray luminous than similarly aged ordinary rpps @xcite , although they show no bursting activity and are less luminous than the magnetars .",
    "therefore , it has been proposed @xcite that the cooling of xinss is affected by heating of the neutron - star surface due to magnetic - field decay . if correct",
    ", this suggests that xinss may be evolutionarily related to the magnetars ; one possibility is that xinss are magnetar descendants , being older versions of neutron stars that were born with @xmath12@xmath13 g magnetic fields which have slowly decayed with time .",
    "the hint of magnetic field decay heating in xinss suggests that similar processes may be occuring in radio pulsars that have ages and magnetic fields comparable to those of the inss . thanks to radio surveys over the past decade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a class of radio pulsar having inferred magnetic fields comparable to xinss and even _ bona fide _ magnetars has emerged .",
    "what physically differentiates these high-@xmath14 rpps from these other classes is unclear ; aside from their radio emission , which was selected for via their discovery in radio surveys , their x - ray emission properties may well be similar to those of the xinss and magnetars .",
    "indeed , in 2009 the high time resolution universe survey discovered a radio pulsar whose rotational and x - ray properties identified it as a magnetar @xcite .",
    "here we present x - ray observations of three high-@xmath14 radio pulsars : psrs j1734@xmath03333 , b1845@xmath019 , and j1001@xmath05939 .",
    "these as a group are key sources for x - ray study , as they share spin , and hence spin - inferred properties with the xinss and magnetars .",
    "thus they might be expected to share x - ray properties , too .",
    "psr j1734@xmath03333 has period @xmath15 and period derivative @xmath16 and was discovered in the parkes multibeam survey @xcite .",
    "its spin parameters imply a spin - down luminosity of @xmath17ergs@xmath18 , characteristic age of @xmath19kyr , and an inferred surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath20 g , which is among the highest of all known radio pulsars and similar to those of _ bona fide _ magnetars such as 1e 2259 + 586 ( @xmath21 ; @xcite ) and swift j1822.3@xmath01606 ( @xmath22 ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "it has a radio dispersion measure ( dm ) of 578pc@xmath23 which , based on the ne2001 model for galactic free electron density @xcite , gives a best - estimated distance to the pulsar of 6.1kpc ( although these distance estimates typically have large uncertainties of @xmath2425% or more ) .",
    "based on its unusually low braking index @xmath25 , @xcite suggested that the pulsar s magnetic field is growing , i.e.  its trajectory on a conventional @xmath26 diagram is up and to the right , towards the region occupied by the magnetars . to search for anomalous x - ray emission from the pulsar ,",
    "a short _ xmm - newton _ observation was taken in 2009 .",
    "the source was detected , and although there were indications that it was anomalously hot , it was too faint and the observation too short to determine the spectrum unambiguously or detect pulsations @xcite .",
    "psr b1845@xmath019 is a 4.31-s period radio pulsar discovered in the molonglo pulsar survey @xcite .",
    "it has @xmath27 , @xmath28ergs@xmath18 , @xmath29myr , and @xmath30 g .",
    "it has a dm of 18pc@xmath23 , implying a distance of 0.75 kpc @xcite . the pulsar s magnetic field , age , @xmath5 and distance are close to those of the xinss .",
    "psr j1001@xmath05939 was another pulsar discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite , with period @xmath31s and period derivative @xmath32 .",
    "as with psr b1845@xmath019 , the low @xmath5 ( @xmath33ergs@xmath18 ) , age ( @xmath34myr ) , and high magnetic field ( @xmath35 g ) of psr j1001@xmath05939 are similar to the properties of the known xinss , although at a distance of 2.7kpc ( as determined from its dm of 113pc@xmath23 ) it is farther away than any of them .",
    "in this paper , we report on x - ray observations of these three high-@xmath14 rpps , done with the aim of searching for magnetar- or xins - like emission as might be expected if magnetic - field - decay heating is occuring .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes our x - ray observations , section  [ sec : res ] our results , and we discuss the implications of our findings in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "a deep , 125-ks observation of psr j17343333 was carried out on 2011 march 11 - 12 with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory @xcite .",
    "we also reanalyzed the epic pn data from the 10-ks 2009 _ xmm - newton _ observation of the source @xcite , but not the mos data , as they had neither the proper time resolution nor sufficient source counts to meaningfully contribute to our analysis . in both observations ,",
    "the epic pn camera @xcite was operating in large - window mode and the epic mos cameras @xcite in full - window mode ; the medium filter was in use for all three cameras .",
    "details of the two observations , as well as those described in sections [ sub:1845obs ] and [ sub:1001obs ] , are summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the data from both observations were analyzed with the _ xmm _ science analysis system ( sas ) version 11.0.0 . to search for times of high background flaring that are known to sometimes affect _ xmm - newton _ data , we extracted light curves from over the entire field of view of all three cameras .",
    "the 2011 observation was heavily affected , with over half the exposure length contaminated by background flares .",
    "the 2009 observation showed no such problems .",
    "psr b1845@xmath019 was observed for 38ks by _ xmm - newton _ on 2011 march 16 .",
    "the pn camera was operating in large - window mode with the thin filter , and the mos cameras were operating in full - window mode also using the thin filter ( see table  [ tab : obs ] for further details ) .",
    "the data were reduced with _ xmm _",
    "sas 11.0.0 , and times of high background flaring were removed .",
    "because the two mos cameras are similar instruments , we combined their images for the analysis of these data .      on 2011",
    "october 8 , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ observed the position of psr j1001@xmath05939 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) for 19ks , using the back - illuminated s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ? * ) as aimpoint .",
    "the 1/8 subarray mode was chosen to achieve a time resolution of 0.44s , sufficient for timing a pulsar of period 7.73s . for our analysis",
    ", we worked with the level 2 event files , which were created from level 1 event lists by including good time intervals as well as information about issues such as bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "the data were analyzed using the tools provided in ciao 4.3 .",
    "using the sas tool ` edetect_chain ` to perform a blind search for point sources , we detected the x - ray counterpart of psr j1734@xmath03333 in both the 2009 and 2011 observations , with the reported count rates in both observations being consistent with each other .",
    "our best - fit position for the x - ray source is the one reported by ` edetect_chain ` for the 2011 observation : ( j2000 ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where the listed uncertainties are the statistical errors only .",
    "it is consistent with the radio timing position of @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite also identified an optical source ( nomad catalog i d 05640621454 ) that lay within the 2009 x - ray error circle and determined that either it or the radio pulsar could be associated with the x - ray source , but not both .",
    "we find that the updated x - ray position excludes the optical source , even when including _ xmm - newton _",
    "s @xmath40 absolute pointing uncertainty , strengthening the conclusion from @xcite that the x - ray source is the counterpart to psr j1734@xmath03333 .",
    "we also found that the radial profile of the x - ray source is consistent with the _ xmm _ point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "therefore there is no evidence of extended emission .      to search for x - ray pulsations from psr j1734@xmath03333",
    ", we extracted counts in the 0.53kev energy band from a region of @xmath41 radius centered on the source .",
    "the mos cameras , operating with a time resolution of 2.6s , were unsuitable for this analysis , so only the pn data were used . within the 2011 source region we found 576 counts , and by extracting counts in the same energy range from source - free regions on the same ccds , we determined that @xmath42 of those counts were from the background .",
    "following the same procedure for the 2009 data we determined that of the 150 total counts in the source region , @xmath43 were from background photons .",
    "after barycentering the source region events with the sas tool ` barycen ` , we folded them into eight phase bins based on a radio timing ephemeris obtained using the jodrell bank 76-m lovell telescope @xcite .",
    "since the time span covered by the radio ephemeris included the epochs of both the 2009 and 2011 observations , we could produce a single summed light curve from both sets of data .",
    "fitting the folded curve to a straight line gave a best - fit @xmath44 of 11.1 for 7 degrees of freedom , or a 13% chance that the folded curve could result with no signal in the data .",
    "therefore , no significant pulsations were detected .",
    "we also performed additional searches , attempting to improve the signal - to - noise ratio by using an energy range of 12kev or a source region of @xmath45 radius , as well as searching around the predicted period , but in all cases there were again no detections of pulsations .    to find an upper limit for the pulsed fraction",
    ", we simulated event lists with the same number of total counts as found in the source region .",
    "the simulated signal had a sinusoidal profile with a random phase and had a user - specified area pulsed fraction , where the latter is defined as the ratio of the pulsed part of the profile to the entire profile .",
    "we found that a signal with area pulsed fraction of @xmath100.23 would be detected with @xmath46@xmath4 significance 68% of the time .",
    "therefore , because 62% of the counts in the source region are from the background , we estimate that the @xmath3 upper limit on the area pulsed fraction of psr j1734@xmath03333 is 0.6 in the 0.53kev energy range .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of psr j1734@xmath03333 from the 2011 pn and mos data using a region of @xmath41 radius centered on the x - ray source position .",
    "background regions were chosen from nearby , source - free areas on the same ccd as the pulsar , and response and ancillary response files were generated with the sas tasks ` rmfgen ` and ` arfgen ` .",
    "the pn and mos spectra were grouped to have a minimum of 25 counts per bin .",
    "we also extracted a spectrum from the 2009 pn data using the same source and background regions as described in @xcite , grouped to have a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "these four spectra were then jointly fit in xspec 12.7.0 using simple power - law and blackbody models , as well as with ` nsa ` @xcite and ` nsmax ` @xcite neutron - star atmosphere models , all using ` phabs ` to model interstellar absorption .",
    "the absorbed power - law model provided a statistically acceptable fit to the data ( @xmath47 for 44 degrees of freedom ) , but as it gave an unphysically steep photon index of 5.2 , we do not consider it any further .",
    "best - fit parameters for the other three models are shown in table  [ tab:1734spect ] .",
    "the best - fit blackbody model is plotted in figure  [ fig : spect ] .",
    "we found a best - fit temperature of @xmath48kev , corresponding to a column density of @xmath49@xmath50 .",
    "the blackbody radius is @xmath51 km , giving a bolometric luminosity of @xmath52ergs@xmath18 , where @xmath53 is the distance to the pulsar in units of 6.1kpc . in order to better explore the confidence range of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the blackbody model",
    ", we plotted their confidence contours in figure  [ fig : cont ] .",
    "the plot shows that the @xmath4 lower limit on @xmath54 is 0.18kev and that lower values of @xmath54 require higher values of @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the maximum column density along the line of sight to the pulsar is @xmath56@xmath50 , and because the dm distance places the pulsar less than halfway through the galaxy , the expected column density is significantly lower than that . as a result , models with @xmath57kev which require @xmath58@xmath50 are further disfavored .",
    "both of the neutron - star atmosphere models provide good fits to the data and yield much lower best - fit temperatures than the blackbody model , as is typical .",
    "the ` nsa ` model gives @xmath59kev , but because it assumes that the emission is from the entire surface of the star , it implies an unreasonably large distance to the pulsar of @xmath1027kpc . fixing the distance at 6.1kpc results in an even lower temperature of @xmath60ev ( @xmath61 for 45 degrees of freedom ) , but the required column density rises to @xmath62@xmath50 , which is not favored as described above .",
    "given these difficulties , we also fit the spectrum to the ` nsmax ` model for a highly magnetized neutron star atmosphere .",
    "this model gives @xmath63kev , @xmath64@xmath50 , and an emission radius of @xmath65 km .",
    "finally , we note that the ` nsa ` and ` nsmax ` models were fit using the highest available values for the magnetic field ( in xspec ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67  g , respectively . since these values are below the @xmath68 g field of psr j1734@xmath03333 , the results are not completely reliable .",
    "we employed the sas tool ` edetect_chain ` to search for the x - ray counterpart of psr b1845@xmath019 , but detected no x - ray sources within @xmath69 of the pulsar s radio timing position .",
    "from the pn image , we found 561 counts in a circular region of radius @xmath70 centered on the pulsar position and 781 counts from an annular region of outer radius @xmath71 around the source region .",
    "from the combined mos image , we found 132 counts in a @xmath72 radius source region and 192 counts in a surrounding annulus with outer radius @xmath71 . in both cases the source regions",
    "were chosen such that they encircle @xmath1080% of the energy from the pulsar according to the on - axis psfs of the instruments .",
    "the background regions are expected to contain a further @xmath1010% of the source energy . to estimate the count rate upper limit of the pulsar , we input these values into the ` aprates ` tool from ciao 4.4 and obtained a @xmath4 ( 99.7% confidence ) upper limit of 0.0048 countss@xmath18 for the pn camera and 0.0029 countss@xmath18 for the combined mos camera .",
    "all counts and count rates are for the 0.23kev energy band .    in order to convert the count rate upper limit into an upper limit on the pulsar s surface temperature @xmath54",
    ", we assume the pulsar s spectrum can be described by an absorbed blackbody model .",
    "we use xspec to find the spectrum for different values of the model parameters ( blackbody radius @xmath73 , distance , and @xmath55 ) and , based on response and ancillary response files generated for the source regions described previously , calculate the predicted count rates for the pn and mos .",
    "we select 5 , 10 , and 15  km as our possible values for @xmath73 , and we use the dm distance to the pulsar of 0.75kpc .",
    "the total column density along the pulsar s line of sightis @xmath74@xmath50 , so we evaluate @xmath54 upper limits for a range of column densities with @xmath75 and calculate bolometric luminosity based on @xmath54 and @xmath73 .",
    "we found that the upper limits from the combined mos cameras provide less strict constraints than those of the pn camera , so we present only the upper limits from the pn image of psr b1845@xmath019 here .",
    "these upper limits , in both @xmath54 and bolometric luminosity , are shown in figure  [ fig : b1845 ] .",
    "taking the rather conservative values of @xmath76@xmath50 and @xmath77 km , our @xmath4 upper limits on @xmath54 and bolometric luminosity are 48ev and @xmath78 .",
    "no x - ray signal was observed at the expected radio position of psr j1001@xmath05939 .",
    "we extracted 0 counts over the 0.33kev energy range from a @xmath79 radius circular region centered on the pulsar position and 141 counts in the same energy range from a surrounding annular region with outer radius @xmath80 .",
    "the radius of the source region was chosen such that it contains @xmath1099% of the expected signal based on the _ chandra _ on - axis psf ; the rest of the potential signal should be present in the background annulus . from these values",
    "the ciao ` aprates ` tool gives a @xmath4 upper limit on the pulsar s 0.33kev count rate of @xmath81 countss@xmath18 .",
    "using the same procedure as outlined above for psr b1845@xmath019 , we can obtain upper limits for the surface temperature of psr j1001@xmath05939 from our count rate upper limits .",
    "we again choose blackbody radii of @xmath82 , 10 , and 15 km , and use the dm distance to the pulsar of 2.7kpc .",
    "based on the dm distance , we also estimate the column density to be @xmath83@xmath50 from the 3-dimensional galactic extinction ( @xmath84 ) model of @xcite and the relation @xmath85@xmath50 in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we evaluate @xmath54 and luminosity upper limits for @xmath86 .",
    "note that the total @xmath55 along the line of sight to the pulsaris @xmath87@xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig : j1001 ] shows our results for the @xmath54 and bolometric luminosity upper limits of psr j1001@xmath05939 . in particular ,",
    "for our estimate of @xmath83@xmath50 and assuming a blackbody radius of 10 km , we find @xmath4 upper limits of 56ev for @xmath54 and @xmath88 for the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we have reported on a new long _ xmm - newton _ observation of the young , high-@xmath14 pulsar psr j1734@xmath03333 .",
    "we found a more precise position for the x - ray counterpart that falls within the error ellipse of the pulsar s radio timing position .",
    "we were unable to detect x - ray pulsations , and the @xmath3 upper limit of 60% ( 0.53kev ) that we set on the pulsed fraction is not very constraining .",
    "psr j1734@xmath03333 has a thermal spectrum , well fit by a blackbody model with an unusually high temperature , @xmath48kev , and corresponding blackbody radius of @xmath89 km .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is @xmath90ergs@xmath18 , giving an x - ray efficiency of @xmath91 .",
    "the pulsar s small emission radius is suggestive of thermal emission from heated polar caps , but such models predict x - ray efficiencies less than @xmath92 .",
    "for example , the polar cap reheating model of @xcite predicts @xmath93 for psr j1734@xmath03333 , an order of magnitude below what we observe . of course , if the dm distance is incorrect and the true distance to the pulsar is within 2kpc @xmath94 , then the x - ray efficiency drops to roughly what is predicted for polar cap reheating .",
    "however , @xcite warn their model may not apply to pulsars with @xmath95 g so these predictions are unreliable .",
    "the pulsar s blackbody temperature of 0.30kev is almost three times as high as expected from a minimal cooling model ( 0.070.11kev ; @xcite ) given its age .",
    "even the neutron - star atmosphere models give best - fit temperatures that are too high , @xmath96kev , though their uncertainties do overlap with the range of predicted cooling temperatures .",
    "for instance , the ` nsa ` model with distance fixed at 6.1kpc gives @xmath97kev .",
    "however , note that as with the simple blackbody , lower temperatures are correlated with higher @xmath55 in the atmosphere models too , which can disfavor that region of parameter space as explained in section  [ sub:1734spect ] .    although our ignorance regarding the correct atmosphere model for psr j1734@xmath03333 precludes meaningful comparisons of its x - ray emission with models of neutron star cooling , we can nevertheless compare our results with those of other rpps of comparable age .",
    "we do this in figure  [ fig : agekt ] where we plot blackbody temperature versus characteristic age for rpps , xinss , and magnetars .",
    "sources are shown in red and yellow ( where `` high '' means @xmath98 g ) .",
    "although a blackbody model neglects atmospheric effects and hence is almost certainly incorrect for these sources , it provides a simple spectral parameterization by which to describe all source spectra and allows a consistent comparison of spectral properties , even if ultimately not fully physical .",
    "figure  [ fig : agekt ] shows that psr j1734@xmath03333 has a much higher blackbody temperature than nearly all other radio pulsars for which this quantity has been measured , with the possible exception of psr j1119@xmath06127 , another high-@xmath14 rpp ( @xcite ;",
    "ng et al . 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is even hotter than the magnetar xte j1810@xmath0197 , although its temperature is well below those of the other magnetars .",
    "in particular , however , it is far hotter than multiple other rpps of comparable age but smaller magnetic field .",
    "indeed , as noted by @xcite , high-@xmath14 rpps in general show a trend toward higher blackbody temperatures when compared with lower-@xmath14 rpps of similar age .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field affects the observed thermal properties of rpps , as is expected if the star is actively heated by field decay .",
    "however , enhanced thermal emission could also be a result of passive effects such as magnetically altered thermal conductivity @xcite without any active field decay .",
    "distinguishing between active and passive explanations for the enhanced thermal emission in high-@xmath14 rpps could be achieved via detailed modelling , or perhaps by observing other signatures of active field decay , such as magnetar - like bursts in high-@xmath14 rpps . indeed this has been observed in one source already @xcite .",
    "we have reported on x - ray observations of two rotation - powered pulsars , psrs b1845@xmath019 and j1001@xmath05939 , taken with the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ telescopes , respectively . in both cases we failed to detect the pulsars and set upper limits on their @xmath54 , assuming a blackbody spectrum .",
    "these two sources were selected for observation because their spin - derived properties are very similar to those of the xinss , but as shown in figure  [ fig : agekt ] , this is not the case in the x - ray band .",
    "the @xmath54 upper limits we find for our two pulsars imply that they are significantly cooler than the bulk of the xins population , although we can not exclude the possibility that their temperatures are similar to that of the coolest known xins , rx j0420.0@xmath05022 @xcite .    in the magneto - thermal evolution model of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the xinss are born with magnetic fields much higher than what we currently measure ( @xmath99@xmath12 g , possibly including a significant toroidal component ) .",
    "as they age , the field decays and heats the surface of the star . a reasonable explanation , then , for psrs b1845@xmath019 and j1001@xmath05939 to have much lower temperatures than most of the xinss , is that they have similar ages but were born with lower magnetic fields .",
    "they would therefore experience less heating from magnetic - field decay and their thermal evolution would more closely resemble the standard cooling curves of non - magnetic neutron stars .",
    "this explanation was also suggested by @xcite to account for the low temperature of rx j0420.0@xmath05022 , and indeed the upper limits on our sources do allow for the possibility that they and rx j0420.0@xmath05022 followed similar evolutionary tracks .",
    "another possible explanation is that psrs b1845@xmath019 and j1001@xmath05939 do not have similar ages to the xinss .",
    "the above models assume that the xinss have true ages of @xmath100.51myr , based on kinematic age estimates for some of them @xcite .",
    "these kinematic ages are smaller than those inferred from spin - down ( 1.54myr ) .",
    "if the kinematic ages are correct , then it is possible that our radio pulsar sources have true ages considerably closer to their characteristic ages ( possibly as a result of different evolution as above ) . in that case",
    ", they have lower temperatures than most or all of the xinss simply because they are older and have cooled further . for a related scenario see @xcite , who , based on magneto - thermal evolution , model the low - field magnetar sgr 0418 + 5729 @xcite as being @xmath1011.5myr old and having undergone substantial magnetic - field decay .",
    "in summary , we have presented results from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of three high-@xmath14 radio pulsars : psrs j1734@xmath03333 , b1845@xmath019 , and j1001@xmath05939 . our observation of psr j1734@xmath03333 was taken to follow up on its detection in 2009 .",
    "although we do not detect x - ray pulsations from the source , we find that it has a thermal spectrum with @xmath100ev , significantly higher than predicted by cooling models .",
    "atmosphere models ( ` nsa ` and ` nsmax ` ) yield lower temperatures that are consistent with standard cooling , but the ` nsa ` model in particular predicts too high of a distance or column density . comparing psr j1734@xmath03333 with other rpps , we find it has a significantly higher blackbody temperature than nearly every other radio pulsar for which such a measurement has been made , particularly other rpps of similar age but lower magnetic field .",
