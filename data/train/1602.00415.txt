    "<S> the interaction between an atom and the electromagnetic field inside a cavity@xcite has played a crucial role in the historical development of our understanding of light - matter interaction and is a central part of various quantum technologies , such as lasers and many quantum computing architectures . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of superconducting qubits@xcite has allowed the realization of strong@xcite and ultrastrong @xcite coupling between artificial atoms and cavities . if the coupling strength @xmath0 becomes as large as the atomic and cavity frequencies ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ) , the energy eigenstates including the ground state are predicted to be highly entangled@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitatively new regime can be called the deep strong - coupling regime@xcite , and there has been an ongoing debate@xcite over whether it is fundamentally possible to realize this regime in realistic physical systems . by inductively coupling a flux qubit and an lc oscillator via josephson junctions , </S>",
    "<S> we have realized circuits with @xmath3 ranging from 0.72 to 1.34 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> using spectroscopy measurements , we have observed unconventional transition spectra , with patterns resembling masquerade masks , that are characteristic of this new regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a basis for ground - state - based entangled - pair generation and open a new direction of research on strongly correlated light - matter states in circuit - quantum electrodynamics .                </S>",
    "<S> we begin by describing the hamiltonian of each component in the qubit - oscillator circuit , which comprises a superconducting flux qubit and an lc oscillator inductively coupled to each other by sharing a tunable inductance @xmath5 , as shown in the circuit diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sem]*a*.    the hamiltonian of the flux qubit can be written in the basis of two states with persistent currents flowing in opposite directions around the qubit loop  @xcite , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the tunnel splitting and the energy bias between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath11 is the maximum persistent current , and @xmath12 are pauli matrices . here , @xmath13 is the normalized flux bias through the qubit loop in units of the superconducting flux quantum , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the integer that minimizes @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic nature of the persistent - current states enables strong coupling to other circuit elements . </S>",
    "<S> another important feature of the flux qubit is its strong anharmonicity : the two lowest energy levels are well isolated from the higher levels .    the hamiltonian of the lc oscillator can be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the resonance frequency , @xmath20 is the inductance of the superconducting lead , @xmath21 is the inductance across the qubit and coupler ( see supplementary information , section  s2 ) , @xmath22 is the capacitance , and @xmath23 @xmath24 is the oscillator s annihilation ( creation ) operator . figure  [ sem]*b * shows a laser microscope image of the lumped - element lc oscillator , where @xmath25 is designed to be as small as possible to maximize the zero - point fluctuations in the current @xmath26 and hence achieve strong coupling to the flux qubit , while @xmath22 is adjusted so as to achieve a desired value of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the freedom of choosing @xmath25 for large @xmath27 is one of the advantages of lumped - element lc oscillators over coplanar - waveguide resonators for our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage is that a lumped - element lc oscillator has only one resonant mode . </S>",
    "<S> together with the strong anharmonicity of the flux qubit , we can expect that our circuit will realize the rabi model  @xcite , which is one of the simplest possible quantum models of qubit - oscillator systems , with no additional energy levels in the range of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling hamiltonian can be written as@xcite @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the coupling energy and @xmath30 is the mutual inductance between the qubit and the lc oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , a josephson - junction circuit is used as a large inductive coupler@xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sem]*c * ) , which together with the large @xmath11 and @xmath27 allows us to achieve deep strong coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> the total hamiltonian of the circuit is then given by @xmath31 nonlinearities in the coupler circuit lead to higher - order terms in @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading - order term can be written as @xmath33 and is known as the @xmath34 term  @xcite in atomic physics . since this @xmath34 term can be eliminated from @xmath35 by a variable transformation ( see methods ) , we do not explicitly keep it and instead use eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the energy eigenstates are product states where the oscillator is described by a fock state @xmath51 with @xmath54 plasmons . because of the coupling to the qubit </S>",

    "<S> the amount of the displacement is approximately @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> as the energy eigenstates of an isolated qubit at @xmath60 are superpositions of the persistent - current states , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the energy eigenstates of the qubit - oscillator system at @xmath60 are well described by schrdinger - cat - like entangled states between persistent - current states of the qubit and displaced fock states of the oscillator @xmath63 , as shown in table  [ ent ] . note that the displaced vacuum state @xmath64 is the coherent state @xmath65 . </S>",

    "<S> it should be noted here that in all five cases in our experiment there will be a significant population in the state @xmath74 in thermal equilibrium , and the thermal - equilibrium qubit - oscillator entanglement will be reduced to below 8% for circuits </S>",

    "<S> in conclusion , we have experimentally achieved deep - strong coupling between a superconducting flux qubit and an lc oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that the energy eigenstates are schrdinger - cat - like entangled states between persistent - current states of the qubit and displaced fock states of the oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> we have also observed a huge lamb shift , 70% of the bare qubit frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the tiny lamb shift in natural atoms , which arises from weak vacuum fluctuations , was one of the earliest phenomena to stimulate the study of quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> now we can design artificial systems with light - matter interaction so strong that instead of speaking of vacuum fluctuations we speak of a strongly correlated light - matter ground state , defining a new state of matter and opening prospects for applications in quantum technologies .    </S>",
