    "wireless physical ( phy ) layer based security from a information - theoretic point of view has received considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "such approaches exploit the physical characteristics of the wireless channel to enhance the security of communication systems .",
    "the wiretap channel , first introduced and studied by wyner @xcite , is the most basic physical layer model that captures the problem of communication security .",
    "wyner showed that when an eavesdropper s channel is a degraded version of the legitimate channel , the source and destination can achieve a positive information rate ( secrecy rate ) .",
    "the maximal secrecy rate from the source to the destination is defined as the _ secrecy capacity _ ; for the degraded wiretap channel the secrecy capacity is given as the largest between zero and the difference between the capacity at the legitimate receiver and the capacity at the eavesdropper .",
    "the gaussian wiretap channel , in which the outputs at the legitimate receiver and at the eavesdropper are corrupted by additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , was studied in @xcite . along the same lines ,",
    "the secrecy capacity of a deterministic gaussian mimo wiretap channel has been studied recently in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , the achievable rate in gaussian miso channels was studied . in that context , the channel state information ( csi ) of the legitimate channel was assumed to be available , but only statistical information about the eavesdropper channel was assumed to be available at the transmitter . in @xcite it was shown that when the eavesdropper channel is a vector of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) zero - mean complex circularly symmetric gaussian random variables , i.e. , the channel has a trivial covariance matrix , the optimal communication strategy is beamforming , and that the beamforming direction depends on the csi of the legitimate channel . in @xcite , the authors derived the ergodic secrecy capacity of a gaussian mimo wiretap channel where only statistical information about the legitimate and eavesdropper channels are available at the transmitter .",
    "it was shown that a circularly symmetric gaussian input is optimal .",
    "it was also shown in the same paper that when the eavesdropper and legitimate channels have i.i.d .",
    "gaussian entries with zero - mean and unit - variance ( trivial covariance ) , a circularly symmetric gaussian input with diagonal covariance is optimal .    in this paper , we consider a gaussian multiple - input single - output ( miso ) wiretap channel and assume that only statistical information about the the eavesdropper channel is available at the transmitter . regarding the legitimate channel , we consider two scenarios : a ) only statistical information of the legitimate channel is available at the transmitter ; b ) full csi on the legitimate channel is available at the transmitter .",
    "we extend the result of @xcite and @xcite proposed for the case of multiple - input single - output ( miso ) wiretap channel with trivial channel covariances to the case of nontrivial covariances .",
    "the non - trivial channel covariance matrix corresponds to the case where there exists statistical correlation between the channel coefficients of different transmit - receive antenna pairs .",
    "such cases arise when the transmit and receive antennas are closely spaced relative to the signal wavelength .",
    "we address the problem of finding the optimal input covariance that achieves ergodic secrecy capacity subject to a power constraint .",
    "this leads to a non - convex optimization problem .",
    "the contributions of this paper are the following :    * we derive a set of equations for the optimal input covariance matrix , and propose an algorithm to obtain the solution ( please refer to theorem 1 of section iv ) . *",
    "we show that when the legitimate channel is completely known at the transmitter , in addition to the conditions of theorem [ theo:1 ] , the following hold : 1 ) the optimal input covariance matrix has rank one ; 2 ) the ergodic secrecy rate is increasing with the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . *",
    "we show that when only statistical information on the legitimate channel is available to the transmitter , the legitimate channel has some general non - trivial covariance , and the eavesdropper channel has trivial covariance , the optimal input covariance has the same eigenvectors as the legitimate channel covariance .",
    "* we show that under high snr , the optimal input covariance has rank one .",
