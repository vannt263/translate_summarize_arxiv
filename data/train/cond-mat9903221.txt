    "in this paper , we study the stochastic properties of mib30stock  index volatility . the black ",
    "scholes / merton ( bs / m ) framework for option pricing is based on the assumption of constant volatility @xcite . in practice ,",
    "volatility is time dependent and the characterization of its temporal evolution is one of the main task of the increasing number of physicists working in the financial field @xcite .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly studied both by economists @xcite and mathematicians @xcite .",
    "however , the emphasis has been mainly given to analytically tractable problems .    here",
    ", we use different approaches in the attempt to empirically characterize the mib30stock  index volatility . among the various possible methods , we focus on the stochastic continuous  time volatility approach to option pricing .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section 2 , we present an outline of the stochastic  volatility theory ; in section 3 , the main empirical results are discussed ; finally , conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "in continuous  time finance , stochastic volatility , @xmath0 , can be modeled by means of two stochastic differential equations @xcite , a two factor model : @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are deterministic functions of the spot price , @xmath6 , or of the stochastic volatility , @xmath7 , and of time , @xmath8 ; the volatility , @xmath9 , is a stochastic variable , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are standard one  dimensional brownian motions with correlation @xmath12 for some constant @xmath13 .",
    "the two processes are independent if and only if @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the problem is then to find a unique solution @xmath15 for the system of stochastic differential equations ( [ sde2 ] ) and ( [ sdestoc ] ) .",
    "in the original bs / m model , @xmath16 and @xmath17 vanish and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constant .    if volatility is a stochastic process , continuous riskless hedging in the sense of bs / m ( using an option and the underlying asset ) is not possible @xcite .",
    "this claim is based on a theorem concerning multi ",
    "factor stochastic models . in the particular case of the two  factor model of eqs .",
    "( [ sde2 ] ) and ( [ sdestoc ] ) , in order to form a continuous riskless hedge , a financial instrument with price fully correlated to volatility would be necessary @xcite . a clear and exhaustive introduction to multi  factor models can be found in marco avellaneda s tutorials @xcite .    if the _ ansatz _ of eq .",
    "( [ sdestoc ] ) is accurate , the empirical analysis of stochastic volatility should lead to the determination of the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite , thus completely specifying its stochastic dynamics . in practice",
    ", this task can be very difficult , due to data incompleteness and to possible intrinsic mathematical difficulties .",
    "for instance , more than one set of the coefficients could well reproduce the known statistical properties of the volatility time series .",
    "we have analyzed mib30 high frequency data from 28 november",
    "1994 up to 15 september 1995 .",
    "mib30 is an official index of the italian stock exchange , it is composed by the 30 italian shares with the highest capitalization and trading volumes , and is recorded every minute .",
    "the data set is composed by over 80,000 data : 420 data for every trading day . considering the series of index values , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 min and @xmath24 , we divide our data into non overlapping intervals or _",
    "time windows _ of length @xmath25 .",
    "we choose a _ time horizon _ or _ time scale _ , @xmath26 , which is an integer multiple of @xmath27 .",
    "we compute the logarithmic returns related to every interval @xmath25 as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is such that @xmath30 .",
    "financial practitioners define historical volatility as the standard deviation of the logarithmic returns @xcite .",
    "following them , we estimate the volatility for every time window as follows : @xmath31^{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the mean value given by : @xmath33 if @xmath26 is measured as a fraction of year , we can define the annualized volatility : @xmath34 in order to investigate intraday properties of volatility , we chose a minutely time horizon and an hourly time window .",
    "the results of the 1393 annualized volatility estimates are plotted in fig . 1 .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the power  spectrum  density estimate computed by means of the correlogram method @xcite .",
    "the peak at @xmath35 is due to a daily periodicity of the volatility values .",
    "in fact , in a day there are seven trading hours and with an hourly time window we get seven volatility estimates per day .",
    "indeed , intra  day volatility is u  shaped : it is higher at the opening and at the closure of the market .",
    "this fact has already been observed by economists , and it is also known in the physics literature @xcite ; it probably reflects the lower trading activity around noon . as a further remark",
    ", we are not able to detect any low frequency seasonality or observe a clear flicker behaviour at low frequencies @xcite , as our time series is less than one year long .    in fig .",
    "3 , an estimate of the volatility probability density function is given .",
    "we compare the experimental histogram with a log  stable distribution whose parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are obtained from empirical data .    stable or pareto  lvy distributions @xcite have been introduced in the sixties in finance and economics @xcite and their scaling properties have been recently investigated in relation to the s&p500 stock index@xcite .",
    "zero mean stable distributions are described by the following equation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 give , respectively , the well known cauchy and gauss stable distributions .",
    "a random variable is said to be log ",
    "stable distributed if its logarithm follows a stable distribution .    in order to determine the experimental points ,",
    "the volatility range has been divided into fifty equal intervals ( bins ) . from fig .",
    "1 , it can be seen that there are two outliers . if the outliers are taken into account , a log  lvy distribution with exponents @xmath41 and @xmath42 gives an acceptable fit of the experimental data ( @xmath43 with 47 degrees of freedom ) , whereas the log  normal fit with mean value and standard deviation drawn from data does not agree in the tail region ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "conversely , if the two outliers are rejected as bad data points , and a new histogram is computed using twenty bins , the log  normal fit is as good as the log  lvy fit ( for the log  lvy fit , @xmath45 is 29.2 , whereas for the log  normal , it is 28.7 ; this time there are 17 degrees of freedom ) .    in fig .",
    "4 , the results of detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) are presented .",
    "dfa is used to investigate the presence of correlations in time series @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a volatility walk is defined by means of the displacement @xmath46 : @xmath47 the mean square fluctuation , @xmath48 , around the average displacement is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the average over all the initial steps @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath48 follows the scaling law : @xmath53 if long  range correlations are present @xcite , the scaling exponent attains values @xmath54 .    the points in fig .",
    "4 , top , have been computed according to eq .",
    "( [ dfa ] ) with overlapping subseries .",
    "forty @xmath48 estimates are plotted with their error bars .",
    "errors are computed assuming a gaussian distribution .",
    "the solid line is a least ",
    "square linear fit of the first six points , corresponding to one trading day ; its slope gives @xmath55 .",
    "the dash  dotted line is a least ",
    "square fit of the next thirty  four points and has a slope @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , from our data we can not safely conclude that there is an exponent cross  over at @xmath57 trading day , as was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is possible to argue that @xmath58 ; indeed , a linear fit of the forty points gives @xmath59 .    in fig .",
    "4 , bottom , we present @xmath48 computed by `` de  u  shaping '' volatility values according to the following recipe : @xmath60 where the normalization coefficient , @xmath61 , is given by : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath61 has period 7 : @xmath64    in this way , the daily periodicity is removed and the intra ",
    "day estimate of @xmath65 is @xmath66 , whereas the extra ",
    "day estimate is @xmath67 .",
    "the possible cross  over seems to be suppressed , and the full linear least  square fit gives @xmath68 , that is @xmath58 .",
    "in this paper , we have empirically studied the intra  day statistical properties of stochastic volatility for the mib30 index .",
    "stochastic volatility poses serious problems in contingent claim analysis and risk management . in many cases ,",
    "risk managers consider a daily time window for computing volatility and perform daily hedging .",
    "however , the preliminary analysis of a recent liquidity crisis of a hedge fund seems to suggest that frequent intra  daily hedging could be necessary @xcite .",
    "empirical analysis constrains the form of the stochastic differential equations describing the time evolution of volatility .",
    "in particular , we find in the mib30 index that the volatility has a periodic behaviour with a one trading day period . due to the limited amount of available data ,",
    "we are not able to detect any low  frequency seasonality .    probability  density  function estimates indicate that volatility is log  stable distributed ; if outliers are taken into account a log  lvy distribution gives a better fit than the usually assumed log  normal distribution @xcite .",
    "finally , the dfa results are compatible with the presence of long  range volatility correlations , but we can not safely conclude that there is a crossover between intra  day and extra  day scaling exponents .",
