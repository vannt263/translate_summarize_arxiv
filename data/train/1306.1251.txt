    "the mixed - field orientation of polar molecules via the interaction with an electric field and a nonresonant laser field is a widespread technique to produce samples of oriented molecules .",
    "this method was proposed by friedrich and herschbach  @xcite , and is based on the dc - field induced coupling between the nearly degenerate pair of states with opposite parity forming the tunneling doublets in the strong laser field regime .",
    "a recent experimental and theoretical study has proven that under ns laser pulses the weak dc field orientation is not , in general , adiabatic , and that a time - dependent description of the mixed - field orientation process is required to explain the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "thus , depending on the field configuration , the orientation of a rotational state could be significantly smaller than the adiabatic prediction .",
    "in addition , not all the states present a right - way orientation , and some of them are antioriented .    in a thermal ensemble of molecules ,",
    "the combination of these right- and wrong - way oriented states gives rise to a weakly oriented molecular beam  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the orientation could be achieved by employing either lower rotational temperatures or quantum - state selected molecular beams . by using inhomogeneous electric fields , the amount of populated states is significantly reduced creating a quantum - state selected molecular beam , and achieving with this beam an unprecedented degree of orientation  @xcite .",
    "cold molecular beams , with typical temperatures of the order of @xmath1  k , are created in supersonic expansions of molecules seeded in an inert atomic carrier gas  @xcite .",
    "depending on the rotational constant , the molecules could still be distributed over a large number of rotational states in these thermal ensembles . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the mixed - field orientation of a thermal sample of polar molecules as the rotational temperature is varied .",
    "our aim is to find the temperature at which the thermal ensemble shows a similar orientation as the quantum - state selected molecular beam .",
    "herein , we consider a polar linear molecule exposed to an electric field combined with a nonresonant laser pulse , and provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the mixed - field orientation of a thermal sample of this molecule .",
    "to do so , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation within the rigid rotor approximation for a large set of rotational states .",
    "taking as prototype example the ocs molecule , we explore the mixed - field orientation as a function of the rotational temperature of the thermal sample for several experimental field configurations .",
    "we show that to achieve a significant orientation , rotational temperatures around @xmath2  k and @xmath1  k are required if either a weak or strong dc fields are applied , respectively .",
    "we also present the orientation of individual states and , for some of them , analyze the projections of the time - dependent wave functions on the corresponding adiabatic basis .",

    "<S> we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation within the rigid rotor approximation for several rotational states . using the carbonyl sulfide ( ocs ) molecule as a prototype </S>",
    "<S> , the mixed - field orientation of a thermal sample is analyzed in detail for experimentally accessible static field strengths and laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for the characteristic field configuration used in current mixed - field orientation experiments , a significant orientation is obtained for rotational temperatures below @xmath0  k or using stronger dc fields . </S>"
