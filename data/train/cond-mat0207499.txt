    "double stranded dna ( dsdna , the dna double helix ) is the genetic memory element of all cells .",
    "two copies of the genetic information are encoded into the two complementary - sequence strands , which are base - paired together through most of the cell cycle . however ,",
    "the two strands must be completely separated during dna replication , and partially separated during dna transcription . in cells ,",
    "the separation of dna strands occurs via forces applied by dna - processing machinery .",
    "force - driven dsdna ` unzipping ' is therefore of direct biological relevance .",
    "a few groups have carried out single - molecule studies of dna unzipping by force .",
    "essevaz - roulet , bockelmann and heslot @xcite have studied the @xmath0 pn forces encountered during unzipping of 50 kb @xmath2 dna .",
    "variations of the unzipping force with sequence were observed , which are over the range of about 10 to 20 pn .",
    "other groups have carried out similar experiments on unzipping of dna @xcite and on rna helix - loop structures @xcite , observing similar unzipping forces .    a number of theoretical works @xcite have addressed the equilibrium statistical mechanics of dsdna unzipping , with particular emphasis on the effects of sequence .",
    "unzipping driven by dna torque ( ` dna unwinding ' ) has drawn much less attention in spite of elegant experiments @xcite and corroborating theory @xcite . as a result ,",
    "theoretical consideration of the combined effects of force and torque on unzipping have only recently been discussed @xcite . since dna unzipping involves rotation of the remaining double - helical dna ( fig .",
    "1 ) , one expects that rotational drag torque should produce a contribution to the force needed to unzip dna .",
    "experimentally , no dependence of force on the rate of unzipping up to about 1000 base pairs per second ( bp / s ) has been observed . however , in recent experiments of heslot an appreciable increase ( up to @xmath3 ) in unzipping force was observed , at unzipping rates in the range of 10 kbp / s@xcite .",
    "this paper presents theoretical analysis of the velocity dependence of the unzipping force , for large molecules where the kinetics is dominated by viscous effects . to do this",
    "we introduce a dynamic model of unzipping which combines the polymer stretching dynamics of the extending single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) regions , the rotation of the remaining double - stranded ( dsdna ) region due to the unwinding generated by the unzipping @xcite , and the kinetics of the translation of the ` fork ' separating the ssdna and dsdna regions .",
    "although some work has been done on the langevin dynamics of dna unzipped by constant tension @xcite , a number of open questions remain .",
    "these include the unzipping force for constant end - to - end displacement velocity , the effect of sequence , and the role of rotation of the dsdna .    below , kinetic equations for unzipping show that beyond a certain unzipping rate , the predictions of the theory of equilibrium unzipping cease to apply .",
    "for a 50 kb dsdna this critical rate is about 1000 bp / s , similar to the threshold seen experimentally@xcite . in our theory",
    "there is a buildup of elastic torque in the dsdna due to the drag torque associated with the dsdna rotation .",
    "the ssdna stretching degrees of freedom and the fork region itself remain near to equilibrium at experimentally accessible unzipping rates .",
    "we show that the relation between the unzipping force and the elastic torque buildup during opening is simply determined by the equilibrium coexistence between closed and opened and stretched base pairs , described by the binding - unbinding force - torque ` phase diagram ' .",
    "we first describe the experimental situation in section ii , and then in section iii we review the equilibrium theory of dna unzipping , using a mean - field approach .",
    "we discuss the effects of force applied to the ssdna ends , and torque applied ` upstream ' to the dsdna for homogeneous and heterogeneous sequences . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the relaxation of ssdna stretching and dsdna twisting , and we then present a dynamic model for the propagation of the ssdna - dsdna ` fork ' region for homogeneous and heterogeneous sequences .",
    "we first present a simple theory where we assume that the dsdna twist is in a steady state .",
    "the problem of rezipping of a dsdna is also considered , and it is shown that for rapid retraction , a left - handed viscous torque delays recombination of the ssdnas . finally in sec .",
    "v we analyze the dna twist dynamics in order to understand the delay in force buildup observed experimentally at high unzipping rates@xcite .",
    "the experiment of thomen , bockelmann and heslot@xcite unzips a @xmath2 dsdna of 48502 base pairs ( bp ) in 10 mm phosphate buffer , 150 mm nacl , ph 7 , at room temperature .",
    "the @xmath2 dsdna is attached to two dsdna linker arms each of 7000 bp ; one of these is anchored to a movable glass slide , and the other is attached to a @xmath4-micron - diameter silica bead which is held in a laser trap ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the displacement of the glass slide at a controlled velocity in the range 1 to 20 @xmath5 m/s forces the molecule to open .",
    "after the molecule is opened ( typically after @xmath6 m of displacement ) the stage motion is inverted , allowing the molecule to rezip into dsdna ( reannealing ) .",
    "the force transmitted to the ends of the linkers during the experiment is measured using the position of the bead in the laser trap , which is of stiffness @xmath7   pn / nm .",
    "the stiffnesses of the two dsdna linkers and the two ssdnas depend on force , but are known from other experiments on dsdna and ssdna . at forces near 15 pn the total stiffnesses of the two dsdnas ( together 14000 base pairs ) is @xmath8  pn / nm ; the stiffness of the two ssdnas depends on the number of unzipped base pairs @xmath9 , and is @xmath10  pn / nm .",
    "below , we will neglect the @xmath11 m shift of the bead in the laser trap .",
    "the basic unzipping force follows from the simple argument that unzipping will be thermodynamically favorable when the free energy required for unzipping one base , @xmath12 , is equal to the mechanical work done , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 nm is the projected length of ssdna liberated during unzipping of one base pair .",

    "et al _ have found that pure at ( the most loosely bound base pairs ) sequences unzip at about 9 pn , while pure gc sequences ( the most tightly bound base pairs ) open at about 20 pn @xcite .",
    "this range of force corresponds to base - pairing free energies of 0.8 to 3.8 @xmath1 per base pair .",

    "the equilibrium opening of @xmath2-dna at zero torque has been theoretically analyzed by bockelmann , essevaz - roulet and heslot@xcite , who have numerically calculated the thermal average of the force and the number of opened base pairs .",
    "they included thermal fluctuations of the ssdna and dsdna regions using a free energy of the form ( [ enlib ] ) plus trap / cantilever elastic energy .",

    "to describe the motion of the unzipping fork , we must consider four physical effects .",
    "first and second , we must consider the elongating dynamics of the dsdna linker arms , and the unzipped ssdna .",
    "third , we must worry about the propagation of twist down the dsdna ; each 10.5 bases unzipped forces one more full right - handed twist into the unzipped dsdna region .",
    "finally , we must close the dynamical equations with a model for the translation of the ssdna - dsdna fork in @xmath9 . for each of these processes",
    "we consider relaxational dynamics of the form : @xmath66 here @xmath67 can be the position of a monomer of ssdna or of dsdna , the twist orientation @xmath68 of a monomer of the dsdna being opened , or the number of unzipped base pairs @xmath9 . in each case @xmath69",

    "logarithmic corrections due to long - range hydrodynamic coupling can be added to this discussion but without major effect . to estimate the order of magnitude of the dsdna linkers and the ssdna to equilibrate , we expand the stretching free energies around the force of @xmath79 pn ( the nonlinear elasticity of the previous section is used ) to obtain : @xmath80 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the position along the unzipping direction of either the @xmath9th monomer of the dsdna , or of the unzipped ssdna . in these two cases",

    "by contrast , twist relaxation can not reach equilibrium at the start of unzipping ; the relaxation time at @xmath103 is @xmath104 s. thus , we will now describe the fork dynamics , treating the ssdna and dsdna stretching in equilibrium .",

    "a quasistatic model of fork motion is plausible , with fork velocity in proportion to the free energy change associated with unzipping of one base .",
    "we write the relaxation equation ( [ din ] ) for the fork motion in the continuum limit for the number of opened base pairs : @xmath106 the single - base relaxation time @xmath107 should be on the order of the diffusion time for the @xmath4 nm - long bases @xmath108 s. the force @xmath109 is again determined from ( [ fnx ] ) , and is implicitly a function of both the displacement and the number of open bases .",

    "these curves follow the ssdna - dsdna equilibrium transition , indicating that the opening and the closing of the single base pairs takes place essentially at equilibrium .",

    "5 also shows the slightly lower force occurring at the point where the molecule is 50% unzipped ( dot - dashed line ) .",

    "the force as a function of the displacement for the velocities 4,8,16,20 @xmath5 m/s is in good agreement with experimental data , and reflects the sequence ; note , for example the progressive increase in g - c percentage in the first 2000 base pairs , the decrease from the base pair 20000 to 24000 and the steeper increase from base pair from 24000 to 24500 , all these feature are well reproduced in the experimental and theoretical curves .",

    "this condition happens to be true over the time range @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the longest relaxation mode of the double helix [ see ( [ times ] ) ] .",

    "the dsdna rotation dynamics reaches a stationary regime , and at later times can be considered to be a rigid cylinder rotating at angular velocity @xmath222 . for times beyond @xmath220 , the twist - relaxation dynamics reduce to just the differential equation for the number of unzipped base pairs ( [ dynan ] ) .    to analyze the dynamics for @xmath223 we solve ( [ integ ] ) iteratively .",

    "is collected on the l.h.s .",
    "the iteration is repeated until convergence is obtained , which takes about 20 iterations .",

    "9a shows force versus displacement including the twist relaxation dynamics for homogeneous sequence ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the only difference with the curve obtained without the twist propagation ( shown for comparison for the velocity of @xmath229 m/s , dashed curve ) is the much smoother initial force increase .",
    "theory indicates a force increase spread over the first @xmath230 m of displacement ; after this extension the result converges to the one obtained without twist propagation . while we do observe an initial ` delay ' of the force increase , the range over which theory predicts this effect is shorter than that observed experimentally ( about @xmath63 m ) .",

    "@xmath56 , the iterative scheme exposed above does not converge easily to the solution of ( [ noft ] ) .",
    "we have therefore consider smoother landscapes through a preaveraging of the sequence over @xmath231 bases , with @xmath231 ranging from 1000 down to 100 .",
    "such values permit to reach numerical convergence and are sufficient to detect sequence  induced effects on the micron scale .",
    "the resulting force signal is shown in fig .",
    "9b for maximal velocity @xmath232 m/s .",
    "the percentage of gc bases increases during the initial opening , and this effect spreads the initial force increase over the initial @xmath233 m of extension .",
    "this trend is in qualitative agreement with experimental findings , though the calculated force is lower than the experimental value by a few pn .",
    "we have presented a theory of dna unzipping dynamics , for kilobase or longer dsdnas .",
    "we have shown that torsional drag built by the rotation of the double helix around its axis is the dominant frictional contribution in the opening of @xmath2-dna molecules .",
    "easily observable nonequilibrium effects for @xmath2-dna are expected for unzipping velocities in excess of 2 @xmath5 m/s .",
    "the results of our theory are in agreement with recent observations by thomen et al@xcite of a roughly 40% increase in unzipping force for @xmath2-dna unzipping at @xmath234 @xmath5 m/s .",
    "we have neglected a few physical effects in the discussion above .",
    "first , we have not explicitly included effects of transport of the dsdna base - pairs _ to _ the fork .",
    "this is particularly relevant to the experimental setup of refs . @xcite where the fork moves relative to one of the ssdna anchor points .",
    "this may introduce an additional translational contribution to the dsdna drag ( for a rod model , again proportional to @xmath112 ) .",
    "however , an estimate made by thomen et al@xcite suggests that this force should be small relative to the unzipping forces .",
    "in fact , at the lower fork velocities @xmath235 @xmath5 m/s where nonequilibrium effects are observable , separate experiments and theory shows that a @xmath2-dna coil should only be slightly stretched@xcite .    a second factor that we have ignored is the possible effect of dsdna intrinsic bends .",
    "nelson has recently argued that such bends should induce an orders - of - magnitude effective enhancement in the rotational drag coefficient @xcite . in the present experiment",
    ", it appears that this effect is nearly absent .",
    "possibly , the roughly twofold enhancement of @xmath74 over its ` bare ' chemical value , needed to generate the observed unzipping force enhancement , is due to permanent bends or other structural inhomogeneities along the rotating double helix .",
    "a third , and potentially interesting effect is that once appreciable torque is built up in the dsdna , there is the possibility that the upstream dsdna may begin to writhe @xcite . for a dsdna under zero force , writhing ( supercoiling )",
    "occurs when @xmath236 @xcite .",
    "tension in excess of @xmath237 pn ( @xmath238 nm is the dsdna bending persistence length ) pushes the writhing threshold up to @xmath239 . writhing ( chiral coiling ) of the dsdna",
    "could increase the effective @xmath74 , even without the formation of plectonemic supercoils .",
    "formation of plectonemes is straightforward if the dsdna region starts as a random coil , since there will be near - crossings every few kb ( every 5 to 6 persistence lengths ) to act as plectoneme ` anchors ' .",
    "once plectonemes form , we expect a large enhancement in the effective friction for dsdna rotation , and a large increase in unzipping force",
    ".    it would be very interesting to see results for an experiment carried out in the geometry of fig .",
    "this might be done using two translated laser traps , which would allow much less perturbation of the dsdna coil during unzipping .",
    "a natural question is raised by the absence of a noise term in eqn ( [ dinfor ] ) , preventing the system from probing the whole free energy landscape at equilibrium@xcite ( see also @xcite , section vii ) .",
    "this approximation , which makes easier for the system to be blocked in a local minimum ( stick regime ) , is expected to be valid at large velocities _",
    "i.e. _ when the landscape changes very fast , and times scales are too small to allow for barrier crossing between stick and slip states . to further test the validity of eqn ( [ dinfor ] ) ,",
    "we have calculated the number of open base pairs @xmath9 as a function of displacement @xmath18 at extremely low velocity e.g. 10 nm / s for the @xmath2 sequence .",
    "results are in very good agreement with equilibrium predictions of fig .  4 ; the only difference is that unstick jumps ( inset of fig .",
    "4 ) take sometimes place @xmath240 nm after their equilibrium counterparts .",
    "finally , we note that the intrinsic fork motion time @xmath107 might be larger than the @xmath241/s assumed in this paper using dimensional considerations .",
    "the activation barriers to opening of successive bases @xcite might make @xmath107 larger ; a recent estimate based on the analysis of a rna opening experiment at constant force @xcite gave @xmath242s@xcite .",
    "however , there will be little consequence of a larger @xmath107 for the phenomena discussed in this paper , which occur on a much longer time scale .",
