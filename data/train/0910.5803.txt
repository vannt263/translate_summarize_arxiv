    "the traditional view of planetary nebulae ( pns ) is that it is a shell of gas ionized by a hot central star and exhibits an emission - line spectrum .",
    "the theoretical understanding that pns descend from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and should contain remnants of the dust envelope led to the realization that pns should also be bright infrared objects @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed after the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) all - sky survey found that over 1000 pns show far infrared emission @xcite .",
    "the typical color temperature of the dust component in pns is between 100 and 200 k , warmer than the dust component in h  ii regions but cooler than the circumstellar dust envelopes of agb stars .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the dust envelopes in pns represent the dispersing remnants of the agb envelopes @xcite .",
    "infrared emission is now recognized as a defining observational properties of pns .    however , the location of the infrared emitting dust component remains poorly known .",
    "only recently has the angular resolution of mid - infrared cameras on large ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics become high enough to image the distribution of dust in pns .",
    "space observations therefore offer a better opportunity to survey a large number of pns .",
    "the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ has an angular resolution @xmath3 arcsec @xcite and its capability in imaging the dust component of pns has been clearly demonstrated by @xcite . since the peak of the dust emission from pns occurs at wavelengths @xmath4 @xmath0 m , the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although offering less angular resolution than irac , would provide useful information on the distribution of the main cold dust component . based on the mips observations at 24 and 70@xmath0 m , @xcite found possible evidence for the presence of a debris disk around the central star of the helix nebula .",
    "other examples of pns studied by _ spitzer _ includes ngc2346 @xcite , ngc650 @xcite , and a sample of pns in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the advantages of ir observations is that they are hardly affected by dust reddening and are therefore ideal to study pns heavily obscured by interstellar dust . from the irac observations , @xcite identified an extremely red pn g313.3 + 00.3 which is optically invisible .",
    "this raises the possibility that there are many obscured pns in the galaxy , for which _ spitzer _ ir observations could explore .",
    "a high - spatial - resolution and high - sensitivity h@xmath1 survey of the southern galactic plane has been undertaken using the anglo - australiam observatory uk schmidt telescope ( aao / ukst ) to search for very faint pns @xcite .",
    "this has led to the discovery of over 1000 new pns and pn candidates ( which we refer to hereafter simply as pns ) .",
    "the results of this survey was published as the macquarie / aao / strasbourg h@xmath1 planetary galactic catalogue ( mash ) @xcite and the mash  ii supplement @xcite .",
    "these new pns are typically more obscured than known galactic pns and warrant further investigation at ir wavelengths .",

    "we present the photometry and images of 37 pns detected in the glimpse  ii survey .",
    "these results are compared with those of the glimpse  i pns . to better explore nebular dust emission",
    ", we also take into account the 24@xmath0 m data from the _ spitzer _ legacy program mips inner galactic plane survey ( mipsgal ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we briefly introduce the glimpse  ii observations and the _ spitzer _ data used in this study ; in section  3 we describe the data processing ; in section  4 we present the mid - ir images and our measurement results of fluxes , sizes , and seds for individual pns ; the astrophysical implications of our results are discussed in section  5 ; and section  6 summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "the data used in this paper were taken from the glimpse  ii version 2.0 data release .",
    "the glimpse  ii survey covers longitudes within 10@xmath6 of the center regions of the galaxy ( @xmath7 for @xmath55@xmath6 , @xmath9 for @xmath102@xmath6 , and @xmath11 for @xmath120@xmath6 ; total area @xmath13 square degrees ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath0 m with resolutions from 1.6@xmath141.8@xmath14 , but excludes an area of @xmath15 square degrees at the galactic center observed by the pid 3677 go program ( which however has been included in the glimpse  ii v2.0 mosaics ) .",
    "the survey regions are roughly shown in figure  [ lb ] .",
    "the observations were made with three 1.2 second exposures at each position during the periods between september 2005 and april 2006 .",
    "the procedures of data reduction are similar to those described in paper  i. the glimpse  ii data products include mosaic images , a highly reliable point source catalog ( glmiic ) , and a more complete point source archive ( glmiia ) .",
    "further details of the glimpse  ii data can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also made use of the data from the mipsgal survey .",
    "the mipsgal observations were carried out at several epochs between 20052006 utilizing the mips instrument aboard _ spitzer _ , aiming at providing a longer - wavelength complement to the glimpse survey .",
    "an area of 278 square degrees in the inner galactic plane , completely overlapping the glimpse  ii observations , was imaged at the 24 and 70@xmath0 m bands . in this study , we only used the publicly available 24@xmath0 m images of the same region as glimpse  ii .",
    "these images have a basic sensitivity of @xmath16@xmath0jy and a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath17 . the detector for mips24",
    "is @xmath18 pixel si : as arrays with a bandwidth of 4.7@xmath0 m .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m mosaics have a saturation limit of 1700mjy / sr for extended source and a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the data calibration was performed by both the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) and the mipsgal team .",
    "a good summary of the current status of the mips24 data sets can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data reported in this paper were taken from the mipsgal v3.0 data delivery @xcite , which provides the 24@xmath0 m mosaics ( @xmath20 in size ) for all the survey regions .",
    "we compared the glimpse  ii data sets with the edinburgh / aao / strasbourg catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae ( version 1.0 ; * ? ? ? * ) and the mash / mash  ii catalogue ( hereafter referred to as mash pns ) .",
    "these optical catalogues include the new pns identified in the aao / strasbourg h@xmath1 survey of the milky way and a small percentage of previous known galactic pns .",
    "we first selected a subsample of 71 mash pns lying in the glimpse  ii survey region , among which 10 were taken from the mash  ii catalogue .",
    "we then undertook careful visual examination of the glimpse  ii images in all the four irac bands using the ds9 software package .",
    "if a pn is visible at at least one of the bands , we extracted a portion of the four - band images centered on the coordinates of this pn and measured its integrated fluxes .",
    "the total fluxes of these pns were obtained using the same method as in paper  i. we first deduced the total on- and off - source fluxes using two apertures which have an identical size and were respectively centered on the pns and in a position near the sources .",
    "then the sum of all the fluxes of sources in the point - source archive within each aperture was obtained and subtracted from the on- and off - source fluxes respectively .",
    "the pn fluxes were finally determined from the on - source net fluxes subtracted off - source net fluxes .",
    "we have taken care to avoid over- and under - subtraction of the fluxes of point sources .",
    "for saturated sources , we only estimated lower limits of the fluxes .",
    "since most of the glimpse  ii pns have well - defined boundaries , we also measured the major and minor diameters of each pn .",
    "for a few sources which have diffuse structures , the sizes of the bright parts were roughly estimated .",
    "the same procedure is also applied to the mips24 data .",
    "there are several mash pns which have prominent 24@xmath0 m emission but have no irac counterparts .",
    "we do not include these pns in this analysis .",
    "given the fact that the mips24 images have a resolution about three times lower than the irac ones , in some cases field stars can not be resolved from the pns in the mips24 images , and thus the flux measurements should be treated with some caution .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m mosaics show some artificial structures around bright sources .",
    "we have attempted to minimize the effects of artifacts on the measurements of fluxes and sizes . some pns show faint extend halos which are likely to be real .",
    "we did not take into account these faint halos in the flux estimation since the fluxes of these halos are negligible compared with those of the main nebular regions .",
    "we find that 37 mash pns ( including five from the mash  ii catalogue ) have visible irac counterparts , among which nine are previously known galactic pns ( table[name ] ) .",
    "the detection rate of the glimpse  ii pns is 52@xmath21 , about three times higher than that of the glimpse  i pns ( 18@xmath21 ; paper  i ) .",
    "this is partly ascribed to the fact that the interstellar extinction toward the galactic center is heavier and thus the optical observations only revealed those relatively bright pns within the glimpse  ii field .",
    "most of the glimpse  ii pns appear to be compact and spherical , probably suggesting that they are generally more distant than glimpse  i pns although we can not completely rule out the possibility that some glimpse  ii pns are young and intrinsically compact .",
    "all the glimpse  ii pns are strong 24@xmath0 m sources , some of which are even saturated .    figure .",
    "[ lb ] gives the approximate survey coverage of the glimpse  i / ii projects overlaid with the positions of mash pns .",
    "a total of 12 glimpse  ii pns are located within the regions of @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a surface density of @xmath22pns per 10deg@xmath23 , a factor of six lower than that of glimpse  ii pns in the regions of @xmath24 , where @xmath25pns per 10deg@xmath23 .",
    "this is due to the strong ir background emission which hampers the detections of those pns close to the galactic plane , as one can clearly see in @xcite ( their figure .  1 )",
    "this suggests that irac counterparts are more easily found outside the galactic plane .    in figure .",
    "[ lb ] we also plot the coverage of the glimpse  3d survey ( pi : benjamin ; pid@xmath26 ) , which images 112 square degrees in a series of regions with higher galactic latitudes in all the four irac bands aiming at investigating the vertical stellar and interstellar structure of the inner galaxy .",
    "we suppose that more pns can be discovered in the glimpse  3d field and it is interesting to compare the properties of these pns located at higher galactic latitudes with those of the glimpse  i / ii pns .",
    "our work on the pns detected in the glimpse  3d survey is in progress and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the irac images of the 37 pns are displayed in figure  [ irac][irac37 ] , where we also overplot the contours of h@xmath1 emission for comparison .",

    ", we have adjusted the imaging depths as well as contrasts to create these color images .",

    "due to the very bright background emission that tends to overwhelm the near - ir emission from the pns , most of the pns near the galactic center were detected by irac only in the 8.0@xmath0 m band .",
    "the measured source sizes are presented in column  913 . for comparison ,",
    "column  14 gives the h@xmath1 sizes taken from the mash catalogues .",

    "the resultant @xmath30 values are given in column  15 .",
    "to better constrain the ir spectral properties of the glimpse  ii pns , we have searched other data archives , including the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) , _ midcourse space experiment ( msx ) _ , and the _ iras _ point source catalogue ( psc ) .",
    "data from these catalogues together cover the spectral region from 0.82 to 100@xmath0 m .",
    "all the available images have been checked visually to ensure that the correct counterpart is used .",
    "table  [ other ] tabulates the magnitudes and fluxes of these measurements . as these other surveys all have lower sensitivities than irac , in general only the brightest sources in the glimpse  ii sample are detected in the other surveys .",
    "since irac also offers better angular resolution , all the sources are unresolved in these archives , with the only exception of png @xmath31 .",
    "as png @xmath31 has a large angular size , the data given in these point source catalogues only represent the lower limits of fluxes .",
    "we therefore do not include this object in table  [ other ] .",
    "combining our irac and mips photometry with these archive data , we have constructed seds for the pns listed in table  [ other ] and the results are displayed in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "a glance at figure  [ sed ] shows that almost all the glimpseii pns are red objects with a rising spectrum between 1 and 20 @xmath0 m .",
    "their seds are in general consistent with the presence of a cold dust component of temperature lower than 300k .",
    "this confirms the _ iras _ observations that pns are generally surrounded with cold dust shells @xcite .",
    "some sources have a separate emission component at short wavelengths ( @xmath32@xmath0 m ) , which can be attributed to contributions from the photospheric , nebular bound - free , or hot dust emission components ( see , * ? ? ?",

    "the sed slopes for all the glimpse  ii pns are @xmath33 , substantially larger than those found for stellar photospheres @xcite . based on their study of young stellar objects ( ysos )",

    "@xcite determined the @xmath30 values for 19 ultracompact ( uc ) h  ii regions , which are comparable with those for pns .",
    "although further statistical work based on a larger pn sample needs to be performed to determine whether the classification of yso can apply to pns , we show here that @xmath30 can serve as a useful indicator to investigate nebular properties .",
    "nevertheless , it should be borne in mind that the slopes of pns seds can be significantly affected by various emission features ( as discussed below ) and it is difficult to reach solid conclusions without spectroscopic studies .",
    "although the seds are useful to distinguish contributions from the photospheric , nebular , and dust components , the presence of various emission features complicates the irac / mips based studies of nebular ir properties .",
    "these possible emission features include : the contributions by the 3.3 , 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath0 m aromatic infrared bands ( aib ) to the 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath0 m irac bands , molecular hydrogen vibrational - rotational bands to all the irac bands , recombination lines ( pf@xmath37 3.7@xmath0 m , br@xmath1 4.05@xmath0 m , and pf@xmath1 7.5@xmath0 m ) to the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0@xmath0 m bands , and atomic collisionally excited lines to the 4.524@xmath0 m bands ( see also paper  i ) .",

    "there is no obvious color difference between the glimpse  i and the glimpse  ii pns in this diagram .",
    "these pns are very red and clustered around a position near @xmath41 . for the pns with mir emission dominated by contributions from the central stars , the irac colors are close to the @xmath42 point .",
    "we have not attempted to correct for interstellar extinction towards these pns ( which is supposed to be small at irac wavelengths ) but show a reddening vector of @xmath43mag in this figure .",
    "we note that the @xmath40-[8.0]$ ] color index decreases with increasing reddening because extinction in the 8.0@xmath0 m band is primarily caused by a silicate absorption feature peaking at 9.7@xmath0 m .",
    "although one expects galactic bulge pns to suffer a higher degree of interstellar extinction , but this is not evident in figure  [ color ] .",
    "the glimpse  ii pns are indistinguishable from the glimpse  i pns in the color - color diagram . furthermore ,",
    "the data scattering direction in figure  [ color ] is roughly perpendicular to the reddening vector .",
    "we thus conclude that mir extinction is negligible and does not affect the colors of the pns in our sample .",
    "the irac colors of pns mainly reflect the color temperatures and the relative contributions from different components including the photosphere , the ionized nebula , the dust envelop , and various emission features .",
    "we have calculated the simulated colors using blackbody models convolved with the spectral response functions , and the results are plotted in figure  [ color ] . using the simulated blackbody colors as a reference",
    ", we can see that the @xmath39-[4.5]$ ] colors of pns suggest significantly higher temperatures than those by the @xmath40-[8.0]$ ] colors .",
    "this is indicative of the substantial contribution of emission from aib emissions , ionized gas , and/or photosphere to the 3.6@xmath0 m band .",
    "the relative contribution of the latter two have been illustrated in @xcite .    in spite of the fact that pns have different colors with stellar objects ,",
    "the color - color diagram alone does not enable to completely distinguish pns from other mir sources . from figure  [ color",
    "] we can find that the colors for pns partly overlap with those for class  i ysos ( i.e. star with envelope ) and the pns with strong emission from central stars might be confused with class  ii ysos ( i.e. star with disk ) . moreover , some h  ii regions are located within the same position as pns in the color diagram .",

    "a recent mips24-based study to search for debris disk around stars has found 24@xmath0 m excess emission in the helix nebula and suggested that it originates from a dust disk at a distance of 40100au from the central star , and that the dust is produced by collisions of kuiper - belt - like objects @xcite .",
    "assuming that the distances to the glimpse  ii pns are typically larger than 1kpc , we find that the 24@xmath0 m emission extends to @xmath156au from the center , more than a factor of 100 times farther than the sun s kuiper belt , and thus is unlikely to arise from a kuiper belt around low- and intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out the possibility that kuiper belt - like objects may partly contribute to the 24@xmath0 m emission in the centers .",
    "an interesting pn is png @xmath154 which is the only object showing more compact 24@xmath0 m emission relative to h@xmath1 in our sample .",
    "its 24@xmath0 m emission is probably in part associated with the central star .",
    "for the two short - wavelengths irac bands ( 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m ) , the contributions from the hydrogen recombination line and bound - free emission should not be dominant , because if so , the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m emission would morphologically match the h@xmath1 emission well .",
    "the spatially compact 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m emission probably suggest significant contribution from photospheric emission .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the seds ( figure  [ sed ] ) and color - color diagrams ( figures  [ color ] and [ color2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the absolute calibration of irac .",
    "they found that the extended emission surface brightness is incorrectly calibrated and should be multiplied by an effective aperture correction factor ( 0.737 for the 8.0@xmath0 m band ) .",
    "this was subsequently established by @xcite that the irac 8.0@xmath0 m surface brightness should be scaled down by a factor of @xmath157 based on comparison between the irac 8.0@xmath0 m and _ msx _",
    "8.3@xmath0 m fluxes of a sample of 43 regions .",
    "this study predicts a irac8.0/_msx_8.3 flux ratio of @xmath158 for diffuse regions based on the different contributions from aib emission in the two different bandpasses",
    ". a similar study of 14 pns @xcite also confirm their previous results .",
    "here we present an independent examination of the irac 8.0@xmath0 m calibration using the integrated fluxes of the glimpse  ii pns which are very compact diffuse sources .",
    "a total of 10 glimpse  ii pns have _ msx _",
    "8.3@xmath0 m detections . figure  [ compar1 ] compared the spatially integrated fluxes detected in the irac 8.0@xmath0 m and _ msx _",
    "8.3@xmath0 m bands . for comparison",
    ", we also overplot the values for glimpse  i pns . a good correlation between the two fluxes",
    "is clearly shown .",
    "the pn with the largest irac/_msx _ flux discrepancy is png @xmath159 , which has a large _ msx _",
    "8.3@xmath0 m flux compared with the irac 8.0@xmath0 m flux . combining the glimpse  i and glimpse ii measurements",
    ", we deduce an average irac8.0/_msx_8.3 flux ratio of @xmath160 , consistent with the median value of @xmath161 found by @xcite for pns but slightly lower than that of @xmath162 obtained by @xcite for regions .",
    "@xcite found a marginal relation between the irac8.0/_msx_8.3 flux ratio and nebular diameters which suggests that the aperture correction factor increases from 1.0 at small nebular size ( i.e. point - source ) to @xmath163 at @xmath164 .",
    "this relation is not shown in figure  [ compar1 ] because our sample does not include very extended pns .",
    "the pns investigated here have a diameter smaller than 60@xmath165 , and mostly smaller than 20@xmath165 , much more compact than the arcminutes - scale regions .",
    "therefore , we infer that the absolute flux calibration for the compact sources studied here should be accurate , and we do not need to make aperture correction to obtain the integrated fluxes of the glimpse  ii pns .    the [ ] 10.5@xmath0 m line , which can contribute to the _ msx _ 8.3@xmath0 m band but not to the irac 8.0@xmath0 m band , is partly responsible to the irac8.0/_msx_8.3 flux ratio .",
    "pns often have higher excitation class than regions , and thus are supposed to have stronger [ ] emission . as a result , the irac8.0/_msx_8.3 flux ratio in pns ( especially high - excitation pns ) might be lower compared with that in regions .    we can not completely rule out variability as the partial cause of the irac and _ msx _ flux difference for individual pns since the glimpse survey was performed about ten years after the _ msx _ observations .",
    "if this is the case , our study will have implications to understand the pulsations mechanism or binary system in pns .",
    "another possible reason causing the irac/_msx _ flux discrepancy in individual pns is that the _ msx _ fluxes of some pns might be contaminated by blended sources since _ msx _ has a resolution approximate ten times lower than irac .",
    "the ratio of mips 24@xmath0 m to _ msx _",
    "21@xmath0 m fluxes provides an opportunity to establish the reliability of absolute diffuse calibration and our measurements of mips 24@xmath0 m fluxes . for this purpose",
    ", one should at first estimate the predicted mips24/_msx_21 flux ratio through integrating the spectral response functions to the seds .",
    "@xcite investigated the diffuse absolute calibration of the mips 24@xmath0 m channel using a sample of regions , and obtained the observed mips24/_msx_21 flux ratio of @xmath166 . comparing with the predicted value of @xmath167 , which is obtained from three seds pertinent to regions",
    ", they concluded that the absolute diffuse calibration of mips24 is consistent with that of _ msx_21 within @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "we reasonably suppose that predicted mips24/_msx_21 flux ratio of pns is nearly the same as that of regions .    in figure  [ compar2 ]",
    "we compare the mips 24@xmath0 m and _ msx _",
    "21@xmath0 m integrated fluxes of the glimpse  ii pns .",
    "the sensitivity of the _ msx_21 band is approximately 1000 times lower than of the mips24 band , and thus only relatively bright pns can be detected by _",
    "we found that nine of the glimpse  ii pns have _ msx_21 counterparts .",
    "since the mips24 band has a much lower saturated level , very bright sources in the _ msx _ catalogue could be saturated in mips .",
    "this is clearly reflected in figure  [ compar2 ] . excluding the two saturated sources",
    ", we obtain the mips24/_msx_21 flux ratio of @xmath170 , in perfect agreement with value for regions @xcite .",
    "we note that the regions investigated by @xcite are much more extended , and generally have 24@xmath0 m integrated fluxes ranging from 10@xmath17110@xmath172mjy , significantly larger than those of the glimpse  ii pns in figure  [ compar2 ] ( about 10@xmath17310@xmath174mjy ) .",
    "the consistent results obtained from pns and regions , which have remarkably different spatial sizes and integrated fluxes , strongly validate the reliabilities of the absolute diffuse calibration of mips24 and our flux measurements .      a tight correlation between far- and mid - infrared and radio emission from star - forming galaxies has been established and has been a subject of intense discussion for many years ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "the origin of the tightness of this correlation is , however , not completely understood .",
    "it would be interesting to test the mir / radio relation in pns , although they have quite different physical conditions from star formation regions .",
    "if the mir emission is dominated by dust heated by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons from the central stars which also ionize the gaseous nebulae and are responsible for free - free thermal emission in the radio continuum , we would see a correlation between the mir and radio emission in pns .",
    "@xcite compared the irac 8.0@xmath0 m , _ msx _",
    "8.3@xmath0 m , and radio flux densities and obtained an overall mir / radio ratio of @xmath175 .",
    "they also suggest that , unlike that in regions , the mir / radio ratio in pns might change with pn evolution as the result of decreasing amount of uv photons available to pump the aib into mir fluorescence . even without considering the line emission factor , the dust continuum flux of pns will decrease as the dust cools due to geometric dilution of the heating photons , which will occur at a different rate as the radio continuum flux which decreases as the electron density drops as the result of expansion even the electron temperature remains constant .",
    "we note that all the glimpse  ii pns are located within the nvss 1.4ghz survey @xcite field , and 23 of them have nvss detections .",
    "they have sizes smaller than the 1.4ghz beam size of vla and are spatially unresolved at this frequency . in figure",
    "[ radio ] we compare the irac 8.0@xmath0 m and mips 24@xmath0 m integrated fluxes with those from nvss catalogue .",
    "it is evident that albeit with a large dispersion , there is a positive correlation between the mir and radio emission .",
    "the correlation coefficients in the logarithmic space are 0.66 for irac 8.0@xmath0 m vs nvss 1.4ghz , and 0.64 for mips 24@xmath0 m vs nvss 1.4ghz .",
    "figure  [ radio ] also shows that the number distributions of the irac8.0@xmath0m/1.4ghz and mips24@xmath0m/1.4ghz flux ratios are peaked at @xmath15 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that these glimpse  ii pns are approximately at the same evolutionary stage and that the non - thermal emission is insignificant , the dispersion in figure  [ radio ] should be due to self - absorption of radio emission .",
    "for most compact pns , the turnover ( from optically thick to optically thin ) frequency is usually at 1 - 5 ghz , so it is quite possible that some of these nebulae are optically thick at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the object showing the largest mir / radio flux ratio is png @xmath151 which has a high density torus .    a basic observable parameter @xmath176 , @xmath177 being the flux density ]",
    "is often used to characterize the mir / radio relation .",
    "for instance , @xcite obtained @xmath178 for galaxies with different redshifts ; @xcite found @xmath179 for a sample at high - redshifts ; @xcite obtained the @xmath180 values for dwarf star - forming galaxies generally ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 with one extreme case of 2.2 .",
    "for the glimpse  ii pns , we obtain @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the @xmath183 value is consistent with that found for pns in the magellanic clouds by @xcite .",
    "the larger @xmath180 value in pns compared to those in star - forming galaxies is a reflection of the fact that pns and galaxies have different radio and infrared emitting mechanisms .",
    "galaxies radiate non - thermal radiation whereas pns radiate thermal f - f emission .",
    "the dust components in pns are heated by a single central star whereas the dust in galaxies is heated primarily by massive stars .",
    "an investigation of the mash pns within the glimpse  ii field has revealed that 37 optically identified pns have mir counterparts .",
    "these pns are distinguishable from the surrounding stars by their redder color and more extended angular sizes . from their infrared morphologies , we suggest that some of these objects ( png 352.1 - 00.0 , png 353.9 + 00.0 , png 357.4 - 01.3 , png 358.8 - 00.0 ) are unlikely to be pns .",
    "we present the spatially integrated flux and size measurements of these pns at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24@xmath0 m .",
    "mir color - color and color - magnitude diagrams are produced . combining our results with those in other data archives , we construct the 0.82100@xmath0 m seds for these objects .",
    "the primary findings from analysis of these results are summarized below .",
    "compared to the glimpse  i pns , the glimpse  ii pns are generally more compact and have lower spatially integrated fluxes , implying that these pns towards the galactic bulge might be generally more distant .",
    "nevertheless , the mir colors of glimpse  i and ii pns are very similar to each other , and are clearly different with those of stellar objects .    despite some glimpse",
    "ii pns are invisible in the 3.65.8@xmath0 m bands and are only marginally above the irac 8.0@xmath0 m detection limitation , all of them are characterized with very strong 24@xmath0 m emission , which is likely to originate from extended cold dust envelopes .",
    "the nebular morphologies and fluxes detected in different wavelengths allow us to separate the different components in the nebulae .",
    "the 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 m emission may be either more or less compact than their optical counterparts , respectively implying the presence of dust toruses centered on bipolar pns or extended neutral envelopes around ionized gaseous nebulae .      the absolute diffuse calibrations are examined by comparing the irac 8.0@xmath0 m and mips 24@xmath0 m to the _ msx _ 8.3 and 21@xmath0 m fluxes .",
    "we obtain the @xmath184 and @xmath185 flux ratios of @xmath160 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "these results are reasonably consistent with previous studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using data for regions and glimpse  i pns , and suggest good calibrations for these slightly resolved glimpse  ii pns .",
    "we explore the mir / radio relation for pns . a loose correlation between the mir ( 8.0@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m ) and",
    "the nvss 1.4ghz fluxes is found , and can be statistically described by @xmath186the ratio between the flux densities at mir and 1.4ghz . for the glimpse  ii pns , we find @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the larger @xmath186 values and the larger dispersion in the mir / radio correlation of pns compared to those of star - forming galaxies are attributed to their respective different underlying radiation mechanisms .    since the bulk of glimpse  ii pns are located at higher galactic latitudes ( @xmath187 ) , we anticipate that a large number of pns might have been detected in the glimpse  3d legacy survey , which extends the latitude coverage to @xmath188 .",
