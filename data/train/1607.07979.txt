    "the origin of these notes is a course imparted by the second author in the `` @xmath3 congreso latinoamericano de matematicos '' celebrated in cancun , mexico on july 20 -26 , 2004 .",
    "the first redaction was subsequently elaborated by the authors .",
    "the theme of the course was the local study of analytic subsets of @xmath2 , which is the local study of reduced complex analytic spaces .",
    "that is , we will consider subsets defined in a neighbourhood of a point @xmath4 by equations : @xmath5 @xmath6 meaning that the subset @xmath1 is thus defined in a neighbourhood @xmath7 of @xmath8 , where all the series @xmath9 converge . throughout this text , the word ",
    "local \" means that we work with  sufficiently small \" representatives of a germ @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of the course was to show how to _ stratify _ @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , partition @xmath0 into finitely many * non - singular * analytic manifolds @xmath11 , which will be called strata , such that :    * the closure @xmath12 is a closed complex analytic subspace of @xmath0 , for all @xmath13 . *",
    "@xmath14 is a union of strata @xmath15 . *",
    "given any @xmath16 , the `` geometry '' of all the closures @xmath17 containing @xmath15 is locally constant along @xmath15 in a neighbourhood of x.    if by  geometry",
    "\" we mean the embedded local topological type at @xmath18 of @xmath19 and its sections by affine subspaces of @xmath2 of general directions passing near @xmath20 or through @xmath20 , which we call the _ total local topological type _ , there is a * minimal * such partition , in the sense that any other partition with the same properties must be a sub - partition of it .",
    "characterized by differential - geometric conditions , called whitney conditions , bearing on limits of tangent spaces and of secants , it plays an important role in generalizing to singular spaces geometric concepts such as chern classes and integrals of curvature .",
    "in addition to topological and differential - geometric characterizations the partition can also be described algebraically by means of * polar varieties * , and this is one of the main points of these lectures .",
    "apart from the characterization of whitney conditions by equimultiplicity of polar varieties , one of the main results appearing in these lectures is therefore the equivalence of whitney conditions for a stratification @xmath21 of a complex analytic space @xmath1 with the local topological triviality of the closures @xmath22 of strata along each @xmath23 which they contain , as well as the local topological triviality along @xmath23 of the intersections of the @xmath22 with ( germs of ) general non singular subspaces of @xmath2 containing @xmath23 .",
    "other facts concerning whitney conditions also appear in these notes , for example that the whitney conditions are in fact of a lagrangian nature , related to a condition of relative projective duality between the irreducible components of the normal cones of the @xmath22 along the @xmath23 and of some of their subcones , on the one hand , and the irreducible components of the space of limits of tangents hyperplanes to @xmath22 at non singular points approaching @xmath23 , on the other .",
    "this duality , applied to the case where @xmath23 is a point , gives a measure of the geometric difference between a germ of singular space at a point and its tangent cone at that point , assumed to be reduced . among the important facts concerning polar varieties of a germ @xmath10",
    "is that their multiplicity at a point depends only on the _ total local topological type _ of the germ .    applying this to the cone over a projective variety @xmath24 gives a formula for the degree of the dual variety , assumed to be a hypersurface , which depends only on the local topological characters of the incidence between the strata of the minimal whitney stratification of @xmath24 and the euler characteristics of these strata and their general linear sections .",
    "in particular we recover with topological arguments the formula for the class of a projective hypersurface with isolated singularities .    the original idea of the course was to be as geometric as possible .",
    "since many proofs in this story are quite algebraic , using in particular the notion of integral dependence on ideals and modules ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , they are often replaced by references .",
    "note also that in this text , intersections with linear subspaces of the non singular ambient space are taken as reduced intersections .",
    "we shall begin by trying to put into historical context the appearance of polar varieties , as a means to give the reader a little insight and intuition into what we will be doing .",
    "a part of what follows is taken from @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the first example of a polar variety is in the treatise on conics of apollonius .",
    "the cone drawn from a point @xmath8 in affine three - space outside of a fixed sphere around that sphere meets the sphere along a circle @xmath25 .",
    "if we consider a plane not containing the point , and the projection @xmath26 from @xmath8 of the affine three - space onto that plane , the circle @xmath25 is the set of critical points of the restriction of @xmath26 to the sphere .",
    "fixing a plane @xmath27 , by moving the point @xmath8 , we can obtain any circle drawn on the sphere , the great circles beeing obtained by sending the point to infinity in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the circle .    somewhat later , around 1780",
    ", wallis asked how many tangents can be drawn to a non singular curve of degree @xmath28 in the plane from a point in that plane and conjectured that this number should always be @xmath29 . in modern terms",
    ", he was proposing to compare the visual complexity of a curve ( or surface ) as measured by the number of `` critical '' lines of sight with its algebraic complexity as measured by the degree ; given an algebraic surface @xmath30 of degree @xmath28 in affine three - space and a point @xmath8 outside it , the lines emanating from @xmath8 and tangent to @xmath30 touch @xmath30 along an algebraic curve @xmath31 .",
    "taking a general hyperplane @xmath27 through @xmath8 , we see that the number of tangents drawn from @xmath8 to the curve @xmath32 which is of degree @xmath28 is the number of points in @xmath33 and therefore is bounded by the degree of the algebraic curve @xmath31 .",
    "this algebraic curve is an example of a _ polar curve _ ; it is the generalization of apollonius circles .",
    "wallis question was answered by poncelet , who saw ( without writing a single equation ) that the natural setting for the problem which had been stated in the affine real domain by wallis was the complex projective plane and that the number of tangents drawn from a points with projective coordinates @xmath34 to the curve @xmath25 with homogeneous equation @xmath35 is equal to the number of intersection points of @xmath25 with the curve with equation @xmath36 this equation is obtained by _ polarizing _ the polynomial @xmath37 with respect to @xmath34 , a terminology which comes from the study of conics ; it is the method for obtaining a bilinear form from a quadratic form ( in characteristic @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is the polar curve of @xmath25 with respect to the point @xmath34 , or rather , in the terminology of @xcite , the projective curve associated to the _ relative polar surface _ of the map @xmath39 given by @xmath40 .",
    "the term emphasizes that it is attached to a morphism , unlike the polar varieties  la todd , which in this case would be the points on the curve @xmath25 where the tangent line contains the point @xmath34 . in any case , it is of degree @xmath41 , where @xmath28 is the degree of the polynomial @xmath42 and by bzout s theorem , except in the case where the curve @xmath25 is not reduced , i.e. , has multiple components , the number of intersection points counted with multiplicities is exactly @xmath43 .",
    "so we conclude with poncelet that the number ( counted with multiplicities ) of points of the non singular curve @xmath25 where the tangent goes through the point with coordinates @xmath34 is equal to @xmath43 . as",
    "the point varies in the projective plane , the equations @xmath44 describe a _ linear system _ of curves of degree @xmath41 in the plane , which cuts out a linear system of points on the curve @xmath25 , of degree @xmath43 .",
    "it is the most natural linear system after that which comes from the lines ( hyperplanes ) @xmath45 and comes from the linear system of points in the dual space @xmath46 while the linear system @xmath44 can be seen as coming from the linear system of lines in @xmath47 .",
    "the projective duality between @xmath48 and the space @xmath47 of lines in @xmath48 exchanges the two linear systems .",
    "the _ dual curve _",
    "@xmath49 is the closure of the set of points in @xmath47 corresponding to lines in @xmath48 which are tangent to @xmath25 at a non singular point .",
    "its degree is called the _ class _ of the curve @xmath25 .",
    "it is the number of intersection points of @xmath50 with a general line of @xmath47 , and that , by construction , is the number of tangents to @xmath25 passing through a given general point of @xmath48 .    in the theory of algebraic curves",
    ", there is an important formula called the riemann - hurwitz formula .",
    "given an algebraic map @xmath51 between compact non singular complex algebraic curves , which is of degree @xmath52 ( meaning that for a general point @xmath53 , @xmath54 consists of @xmath28 points , and is ramified at the points @xmath55 , which means that near @xmath56 , in suitable local coordinates on @xmath25 and @xmath57 , the map @xmath58 is of the form @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the integer @xmath61 is the _ ramification index of @xmath58 at @xmath56 .",
    "then we have the riemann - hurwitz formula relating the genus of @xmath25 and the genus of @xmath57 via @xmath58 and the ramification indices : @xmath62 if we apply this formula to the case @xmath63 , knowing that any compact algebraic curve is a finite ramified covering of @xmath64 , we find that we can calculate the genus of @xmath25 from any linear system of points made of the fibers of a map @xmath65 if we know its degree and its singularities : we get @xmath66 the ramification points @xmath56 can be computed as the so - called _ jacobian divisor of the linear system , which consists of the singular points , properly counted , of the singular members of the linear system . in particular",
    "if @xmath25 is a plane curve and the linear system is the system of its plane sections by lines through a general point @xmath67 of @xmath48 , the map @xmath58 is the projection from @xmath25 to @xmath64 from @xmath20 ; its degree is the degree @xmath68 of @xmath25 and its ramification points are exactly the points where the line from @xmath20 is tangent to @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath20 is general , these are simple tangency points , so the @xmath61 are equal to @xmath69 , and their number is equal to the class @xmath70 of @xmath25 ; the formula gives @xmath71 thus giving for the genus an expression linear in the degree and the class . _ _",
    "this is the first example of the relation between the  characteristic classes \" ( in this case only the genus ) and the polar classes ; in this case the curve itself , of degree @xmath68 and the degree of the polar locus , or apparent contour from @xmath20 , in this case the class @xmath70 .",
    "after deep work by zeuthen , c. segre , severi , it was todd who in three fundamental papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) found the correct generalization of the formulas known for curves and surfaces .    more precisely , given a non singular @xmath28-dimensional variety @xmath24 in the complex projective space @xmath72 , for a linear subspace @xmath73 of dimension @xmath74 , i.e. , of codimension @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , let us set @xmath77 this is the _",
    "polar variety _ of @xmath24 associated to @xmath78 ; if @xmath78 is general , it is either empty or purely of codimension @xmath79 in @xmath24 . if @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we find the points of the projective plane curve @xmath24 where the tangent lines goes through the point @xmath83 .",
    "a tangent hyperplane to @xmath24 at a point @xmath84 is a hyperplane containing the tangent space @xmath85 .",
    "the polar variety @xmath86 with respect to a general @xmath78 of codimension @xmath75 consists of the points of @xmath24 where a tangent hyperplane contains @xmath78 , a condition which is equivalent to the dimension inequality .",
    "we see that this construction is a direct generalization of the apparent contour . the eye @xmath8 is replaced by the linear subspace @xmath78 !",
    "todd shows that ( rational equivalence classes of ) the following formal linear combinations of varieties of codimension @xmath79 , for @xmath76 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a linear subspace of codimension @xmath89 and @xmath90 is of codimension @xmath91 , are independent of all the choices made and of the embedding of @xmath24 in a projective space , provided that the @xmath92 and the @xmath27 s have been chosen general enough .",
    "our @xmath93 are in fact todd s @xmath94 .",
    "the intersection numbers arising from intersecting these classes and hyperplanes in the right way to obtain numbers contain a wealth of numerical invariants , euler characteristic , genus .",
    "even the arithmetic genus , which is the generalization of the differential forms definition of the genus of a curve , can be computed . around 1950",
    "it was realized the classes of todd , which had also been considered independently by eger , are nothing but the chern classes of the tangent bundle of @xmath24 .    on the other hand , the basic topological invariant of a variety , the euler - poincar characteristic of @xmath24 ( also called euler characteristic for short ) can be computed to show the equality : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the polar variety of codimension @xmath97 with respect to a general @xmath78 of codimension @xmath98 , which is omitted from the notation , and @xmath99 denotes the intersection number in @xmath72 . in this case since we intersect with a linear space of complementary dimension , @xmath100 is just the degree of the projective variety @xmath96 .",
    "so todd s results give a rather complete generalization of the genus formula for curves , both in its analytic and its topological aspects .",
    "this circle of ideas was considerably extended , in a cohomological framework , to generalized notions of genus and characteristic classes for non singular varieties ; see @xcite and ( @xcite , chapters 48,49 ) .",
    "todd s construction was modernized and extended to the case of a singular projective variety by r. piene ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what we use here is a local form , introduced in @xcite , of the polar varieties of todd , adapted to the singular case and defined for any equidimensional and reduced germ of a complex analytic space .",
    "the case of a singular projective variety which we have just seen can be deemed to be the special case where our singularity is a cone .",
    "we do not take classes in ( borel - moore ) homology or elsewhere but instead look at  sufficiently general \" polar varieties of a given dimension as geometric objects .",
    "the hope is that the equisingularity class ( up to a whitney equisingular deformation ) of the general polar varieties of a germ is an analytic invariant .",
    "what is known is that the multiplicity is , and this is what we use below .",
    "_ since the stratification we build is determined by local conditions and is canonical , the stratifications defined in the open subsets of a covering of a complex analytic space @xmath0 will automatically glue up .",
    "therefore it suffices to study the stratifications locally assuming @xmath101 , as we do here .",
    "we emphasize that the result of the construction for @xmath0 , unlike its tools , is independent of the embedding @xmath101 . _",
    "to set the working grounds , let us fix a reduced , and pure - dimensional germ of analytic subspace @xmath102 .",
    "that is , we are assuming that @xmath0 is given to us by an ideal @xmath103 of @xmath104 generated say by @xmath105 , containing all analytic functions vanishing on @xmath0 , and also that all the irreducible components of @xmath0 , correponding to the minimal prime ideals of @xmath104 which contain @xmath103 have the same dimension @xmath28 .",
    "+ by definition , a singular point of a complex analytic space is a point where the tangent space can not be defined as usual .",
    "however , as a substitute , we can look at all limit positions of tangent spaces at non - singular points tending to a given singular point .",
    "given a closed @xmath28-dimensional analytic subset @xmath0 in an open set of @xmath2 , a d - plane @xmath106 of the grassmannian @xmath107 of @xmath28-dimensional vector subspaces of @xmath2 is a limit at @xmath108 of tangent spaces to the analytic space @xmath0 if there exists a sequence @xmath109 of non - singular points of @xmath0 and a sequence of d - planes @xmath110 of @xmath107 such that for all i , the d - plane @xmath111 is the direction of the tangent space to @xmath0 at @xmath56 , the sequence @xmath109 converges to @xmath20 and the sequence @xmath110 converges to @xmath106 .    recall that if @xmath0 is an analytic space then @xmath112 , the set of singular points of x , is also an analytic space and the non singular part @xmath113 is dense in x and has the structure of a complex manifold .",

    "let @xmath118 be the closure of the graph of @xmath119 in @xmath120 .",

    "it is therefore a proper birational map .",
    "it seems to have been first introduced by semple ( see the end of @xcite ) who also asked whether iterating this construction would eventually resolve the singularities of @xmath0 .    the notation @xmath118 is justified by the fact that the semple - nash transformation is independent , up to a unique @xmath0-isomorphism , of the embedding of @xmath0 into a non singular space .",
    "see @xcite ,  2 , where the abstract construction of the semple - nash modification is explained in terms of the grothendieck grassma - nnian associated to the module of differentials of @xmath0 .",
    "the fiber @xmath125 is a closed algebraic subvariety of @xmath107 ; set - theoretically , it is the set of limit positions of tangent spaces at points of @xmath117 tending to @xmath8 .    in @xcite , h. hennings has announced a proof of the fact that if @xmath20 is an isolated singular point of @xmath0 , the dimension of @xmath126 is @xmath127 , generalizing a result of a. simis , k. smith and b. ulrich in @xcite .",
    "+    the nash modification , however is a little difficult to handle because of the fact that the rich geometry of the grassmannian entails somewhat cumbersone computations .",
    "there is a less intrinsic but more amenable way of encoding the limits of tangent spaces .",
    "the idea is to replace a tangent space to @xmath117 by the collection of all the hyperplanes of @xmath2 which contain it .",
    "tangent hyperplanes live in a projective space , namely the dual projective space @xmath128 , which is easier to deal with than the grassmannian .      in order to describe this set of tangent hyperplanes",

    "we could have taken @xmath1356 general in @xmath1355 and @xmath1355 to be @xmath1106 , and then @xmath1361 .",
    "on the other hand in our formula the whitney strata of dimension @xmath1362 are the @xmath109 so all the @xmath1363 are equal to zero , while the @xmath1364 are equal to @xmath1365 , corresponding to the milnor number of a generic hyperplane section of @xmath24 through @xmath56 , as we saw in example [ smoothing ] .",
    "substituting all this in our formula of proposition [ projfor ] gives : @xmath1366 simplifying and rearranging gives : @xmath1367 this formula was previously established in @xcite by algebraic methods , based on the fact that the multiplicity in the ring @xmath1368 of the jacobian ideal is equal to @xmath1369 ; see @xcite for a proof in terms of characte - ristic classes , closer to the approach of todd .",
    "this multiplicity is the intersection multiplicity of the relative polar curve with the hypersurface , which counts the number of intersection points of the polar curve with a milnor fiber of the hypersurface singularity , so that one can see that the  diminution of class \" due to the singularity is the number of tangent hyperplanes containing @xmath174 which are  absorbed \" by the singularity ; see @xcite .",
    "the same method works for complete intersections with isolated singula - rities , since they can also be smoothed in the same way , and the generalized milnor numbers also behave in a similar way . using the results of navarro aznar in @xcite on the computation of the euler characteristics of non singular complete intersections and the results of l in @xcite on the computation of milnor numbers of complete intersections , as well as a direct generalization of the small trick of example [ smoothing ] for the computation of @xmath1370",
    "( see also @xcite ) , one can produce a topological expression for the degrees of the duals of complete intersections with isolated singularities , in terms of the degrees of the equations and generalized milnor numbers .",
    "we leave this to the reader as an interesting exercise .",
    "the answer , obtained by a different method , can be found in @xcite and a proof inspired by @xcite can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the correction term coming from the singularities has exactly the same form as in the hypersurface case .      *",
    "conclusion * : given a projective variety @xmath24 of dimension @xmath28 endowed with its minimal whitney stratification @xmath1325 , we can write the formula of proposition [ projfor ] as follows : @xmath1371 where we agree that @xmath1372 if @xmath1373 , and is @xmath8 if @xmath1374 .",
    "then we see by induction on the dimension that :    [ degd ] the degree of the dual variety , when it is a hypersurface , ultimately depends on the euler characteristics of the @xmath1375 ( or the @xmath787 , since it amounts to the same by additivity of the euler characteristic ) and their general linear sections , and the local vanishing euler characteristics @xmath1376 .",
    "* problem : * given @xmath24 as above with a defining homogeneous ideal , describe an algebraic method to produce an ideal defining the union of @xmath24 and the duals of the other strata of the minimal whitney stratification of the dual @xmath1289 .",
    "for example , the dual of a general plane algebraic curve has only cusps and double points as singularities .",
    "the construction described above adds to the curve all its `` remarkable tangents '' , namely its double tangents and inflexion tangents .",
    "using the properties of polar varieties and theorem [ formula ] one can prove a similar formula in the case where the dual @xmath1289 is not a hypersurface , and thus extend proposition [ degd ] to all projective varieties .",
    "the degree of @xmath1289 is then the multiplicity at the origin of the smallest polar variety of the cone @xmath0 over @xmath24 which is not empty .",
    "now one uses the equalities @xmath1124 which we have seen before theorem [ formula ] .",
    "they tell us that the degree of @xmath1289 is the degree of the dual of the intersection of @xmath24 with a linear space of the appropriate dimension for this dual to be a hypersurface .    more precisely , when @xmath27 is general hyperplane in @xmath72 , the following facts are consequences of the elementary properties of projective duality , remark [ factsofpolarvarieties ] , c ) , and the property that tangent spaces are constant along the generating lines of a cone ( see lemma [ cone ] ) :    * if @xmath1289 is a hypersurface , the dual of @xmath1334 is the cone with vertex @xmath1377 over the polar variety @xmath1378 , the closure in @xmath1289 of the critical locus of the restriction to @xmath1379 of the projection @xmath1380 from the point @xmath1381 .",
    "since we assume that @xmath24 is not contained in a hyperplane , the degree of the hypersurface @xmath1289 is @xmath1382 , hence this critical locus is of dimension @xmath1383 and the dual of @xmath1334 is a hypersurface . in appropriate",
    "coordinates its equation is a factor of the discriminant of the equation of @xmath1289 .",
    "* otherwise , the dual of @xmath1334 is the cone with vertex @xmath1377 over @xmath1289 , i.e. , the join in @xmath276 of @xmath1289 and the point @xmath1377 .    if @xmath1384 this cone is a hypersurface in @xmath276 .",
    "otherwise we repeat the operation by intersecting @xmath1334 with a new general hyperplane , and so on ; we need to repeat this as many times as the _ dual defect _ @xmath1385 so that in the end we can apply proposition [ degd ] to @xmath1386 because its dual is a hypersurface .",
    "the smallest non empty polar variety of the cone @xmath114 over @xmath24 is @xmath1387 .",
    "this iterated cone construction does not change the degree .",
    "this suffices to show that proposition [ degd ] is valid in general . to get a precise formula for the degree of @xmath1289 in the general case",
    "is reduced to the computation of euler characteristics and local vanishing euler - pioncar characteristics of general linear sections of @xmath24 .",
    "* by corollay 5.1.2 of @xcite we have at every point @xmath1287 the equality @xmath1388 * as an alternating sum of multiplicities of polar varieties , in view of theorem [ pe ] , the euler obstruction is constant along the strata of a whitney stratification .    indeed , if we expand the formula written above proposition [ degd ] in terms of the euler characteristics of the strata @xmath787 and their general linear sections , and then remove the symbols @xmath1389 in front of them , we obtain a linear combination of @xmath787 and their sections with coefficients depending on the local vanishing euler - poincar characteristics with the property that taking formally the euler characteristic gives @xmath1390 . redistributing the terms",
    "should then give ernstrm s theorem .",
    "we leave this as a problem for the reader .",
    "another interesting problem is to work out in the same way formulas for the other polar classes , or ranks ( see @xcite ,  2 ) .    finally , by proposition [ projeuler ]",
    "the formula of theorem [ formula ] appears in a new light , as containing a generalization to the case of non - conical singularities of the generalized plcker formulas of projective geometry .",
