    "kpz type growth is one of the generic dynamic processes describing growth of crystal surfaces .",
    "it is named after the langevin equation introduced by karder , parisi , and zhang about a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 with @xmath12 uncorrelated noise @xmath13 numerous microscopic models on the master equation level have been studied numerically as well and are confirmed to be in the kpz universality class  @xcite .",
    "however , many properties of this process are still in question , including basic aspects , like the precise values of the scaling critical exponents , and the detailed structure of the stationary growing state .",
    "part of the problem is the absence of an obvious mean field theory .",
    "the linear , integrable diffusion , part of the kpz equation ( @xmath14 ) does not play the role of mean field theory fixed point in high enough dimensions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the kpz behaviour is governed by a strong coupling fixed point for all @xmath15 , and thus evades perturbative renormalization treatments  @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the dynamic exponent @xmath16 and the stationary state roughness exponent @xmath7 obey the equality @xmath17 in all @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "these critical exponents specify how time and height rescale under a renormalization transformation : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the exponent identity states that under renormalization the amplitude of the non - linear term in the kpz equation does not change .",
    "@xmath21 is a so - called redundant scaling field .",
    "it plays a role similar to lattice anisotropy in equilibrium phase transitions . increasing @xmath21 simply speeds - up the process , and scaling amplitudes are proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "this exponent equality links the dynamic scaling to the stationary state scaling .",
    "therefore the focus has shifted recently to the structure of the stationary state .",
    "the stationary growing state is trivial in one dimension ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is the gaussian distribution .",
    "the up and down steps along the surface are uncorrelated beyond a definite correlation length .",
    "this implies @xmath23 ( the random walk value ) , and from the above exponent identity it follows that @xmath24 .",
    "this behaviour is well established , not only by numerical studies  @xcite , but also analytically .",
    "the @xmath22 body centered solid on solid ( bcsos ) growth model is exactly soluble  @xcite .",
    "it s master equation is a special case of the 2d equilibrium 6-vertex model . in the latter representation ,",
    "kpz scaling describes facet ridge end - points of equilibrium crystal shapes  @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 kpz growth is equivalent also to asymmetric exclusion hopping processes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the exact stationary state of the langevin equation itself is known in @xmath22 and is indeed the gaussian distribution  @xcite ) .",
    "the stationary state is not simple in @xmath25 .",
    "the stationary state roughness exponent @xmath7 takes a non - trivial value and is actually not very well known numerically .",
    "for example , in @xmath26 the reported values vary between @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "lssig made an important analytical break through last year  @xcite .",
    "he proposed the likely structure of the stationary state by studying the operator product expansion of the ( height variable ) correlation functions . under the assumption that the algebra closes and contains only one scaling field operator , lssig obtained a quantization condition for the exponents .",
    "one of these solutions , @xmath8 , is close to the above 2d numerical values .",
    "the moments @xmath28 of lssig s stationary state distribution obey power counting , i.e. , the exponents in the scaling relations @xmath29 are related as @xmath30 .",
    "the distribution lacks multi scaling .",
    "moreover , for the closure of the algebra it is important that the stationary state is skewed . the odd moments , in particular the third one must be non - zero .",
    "in this paper we report a detailed numerical study of the stationary state in 2d for the kim - kosterlitz ( kk )  @xcite and the bcsos model .",
    "we determine the finite size scaling behaviour of the second , third , and fourth moments .",
    "in section 2 we review the properties of stationary state skewness in @xmath22 kpz growth , and list the possibilities in higher dimensions .",
    "section 3 contains our numerical results for the kk and bcsos model .",
    "the third moment is indeed non - zero and the second , third , and fourth moments obey indeed power counting .",
    "we find strong evidence that the amplitude ratio s of the moments are universal , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the amount of stationary state skewness is the same in these two models . in @xmath22 skewness",
    "is tunable , but appears not to be so in @xmath26 .",
    "the values of these amplitude ratio s are the major new results of this paper .",
    "in section 3 we address also whether the difference in the previously reported values of @xmath7 for the kk and bcsos models can be attributed to finite size scaling ( fss ) type corrections .",
    "the fss corrections to scaling exponent is large , but in the same range of values suggested by naive power counting .    to check more directly whether skewness is tunable or not",
    ", we introduce a temperature type parameter @xmath33 in the bcsos model . in the kk model",
    "it is known that @xmath21 changes sign with @xmath33  @xcite . in section 4",
    "we give an intuitive explanation for why this happens .",
    "( it is related to preroughening phenomena in equilibrium surfaces . ) in the bcsos model @xmath21 does not change sign . in section 5 we present mc data for the @xmath33 dependence of the roughness exponents and the amplitude ratio s .",
    "both show some systematic drift , but much smaller than expected if they would vary with @xmath33 .",
    "this study was actually not motivated by lssig s recent results .",
    "it was conceived as a generalization of an earlier study of stationary state skewness in @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the kk model is a special point in the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model .",
    "we varied its adsorption and evaporation probabilities in the 1d model by making them dependent on the local nearest neighbour heights .",
    "that lead to 5 independent parameters .",
    "surprisingly we were able to construct the exact stationary state in a 4 dimensional subspace .",
    "its structure is simple .",
    "the steps in the interface are completely uncorrelated .",
    "only the step density varies .",
    "this state has zero skewness .",
    "it is a gaussian and has particle - hole symmetry . outside this exact soluble subspace",
    "the stationary state is skewed .",
    "this means that in general kpz type growth in @xmath22 has a non - zero third moment @xmath2 in its stationary state .",
    "for example , the kk point lies outside the non - skewed subspace . on the other hand ,",
    "the stationary states in the exactly soluble bcsos model and also the langevin equation itself are non - skewed .",
    "stationary state skewness is distinct from temporal skewness .",
    "most initial states develop into skewed structures at intermediate time scales ( temporal skewness ) even if the stationary state is not skewed  @xcite .",
    "so in @xmath22 , kpz type stationary states are typically skewed , and its amplitude is tunable .",
    "this raises the immediate question whether skewness affects the scaling exponents .",
    "let s refer to the operators leading out of the non - skewed subspace as @xmath34 and to their conjugate coupling constants as @xmath35 . in @xmath22 , a kpz type fixed point with zero - skewness exists .",
    "the question is whether this fixed point is stable ; whether @xmath34 is a relevant , marginal , redundant , or an irrelevant operator .",
    "suppose the non - skewed kpz fixed point is stable . the moments should scale then with system size as @xmath36 with @xmath4 and @xmath37 .",
    "all even moments scale as @xmath38 with universal amplitude ratio s , @xmath39 .",
    "all odd moments scale as @xmath40 \\\\",

    "the odd amplitude ratio s are proportional to @xmath35 , i.e. , the skewness varies continuously .    numerical ( transfer matrix finite size scaling )",
    "results confirmed that the non - skewed kpz fixed point is stable in @xmath22 .",
    "we found @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of @xmath2 ( at e.g. , the kk point ) is indeed roughly proportional to the skewness coupling constant @xmath35 , in accordance with eq.[w - fss ] .",
    "skewness is negative at the @xmath22 kk point . on average hill tops",
    "are wider ( flatter , less sharp ) than valley bottoms .",
    "such a statement is meaningless without a specification of a cut - off .",
    "the definition of what constitutes a mountain and what represents a local hump depends on the length scale at which the surface configuration is being viewed .",
    "( humans do not interpret every grain of sand as a hill . )",
    "skewness is a scale dependent property .",
    "the asymptotic scaling of the moments tells us how asymmetric the hills and valleys are in the large length scale limit . in @xmath22",
    "this skewness persists all the way to microscopic length scales .",
    "we calculated the surplus of sharp valley bottoms over sharp hill tops at the microscopic ( the grains of sand ) level .",
    "this expectation value has the same sign as the macroscopic skewness and is also roughly proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "this invariance of the surface structure over all length scales is related to the rather trivial nature of the fixed point stationary state ( gaussian distribution ) .",
    "the tunability of the skewness at the microscopic length scale is easy to understand .",
    "consider the @xmath22 rsos model with deposition only , with three parameters : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the density of local sharp hill tops is set by the deposition probability @xmath43 of particles on local flat surface segments .",
    "the sharpness of these local hilltops is set by the rate at which they broaden , i.e. , the probability with which particles adhere to existing steps , @xmath44 .",
    "the density of local sharp valleys is set by the rate at which single particle puddles fill - up , @xmath45 compared to the rate at which they are created , @xmath46 .",
    "these processes balance exactly inside the subspace where the stationary state is trivial and has zero skewness . at the kk point ,",
    "@xmath47 , the balance is imperfect and the dynamics creates a backlog of  to - be - filled - up \" local valleys .",
    "newly created local hill tops broaden readily , and therefore are flatter  @xcite .",
    "is the skewness tunable in @xmath25 as well ?",
    "is there maybe a line of kpz type fixed points with continuously varying skewness ?",
    "a varying exponent @xmath7 would explain the current numerical spread in its value .",
    "is it possible to change the sign of skewness without changing the sign of @xmath21 in eq.([kpz - eq ] ) ? or .",
    "is there one single kpz stationary state fixed point distribution , with a universal amount ( and sign ) of skewness ? in that case we need to explain the numerical spread in @xmath48 in terms of strong fss corrections .",
    "these are the issues we address in this paper .",
    "we perform a systematic numerical study of the stationary state properties in the @xmath26 kk - model and the bcsos model . in both cases",
    "we allow only particle deposition ( no desorption ) .",
    "consider a @xmath26 square lattice with an height variable @xmath49 at each lattice site .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions . in the kk - model ,",
    "nearest neighbour columns are allowed to differ by at most one unit , @xmath50 .",
    "choose a site at random , and deposit a particle , @xmath51 , with probability @xmath52 unless such a move would violate the above restriction .",
    "in the bcsos model the square lattice is divided into two sublattices .",
    "the height variables are restricted to be even on one of them , @xmath53 , and to be odd on the other @xmath54 , such that nearest neighbour columns always differ in height by one @xmath55 .",
    "choose at random a site , and deposit a particle with probability @xmath52 if the move does not violate the @xmath55 constraint .",
    "in section [ sec:5 ] we consider also the generalization where the bcsos deposition probabilities vary with the local configuration by means of a temperature type parameter , @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the energy change if the adsorption would take place .",
    "the energy @xmath58 has a tunable parameter @xmath33 and the summation runs over all next nearest neighbours .",
    "this rule is identical to that in standard metropolis mc simulations , except that desorption is forbidden .",
    "the latter breaks detailed balance and leads to the non - equilibrium growing stationary state .",

    ".    it would be much more convincing if the corrections to scaling exponents where known analytically , and/or take simple values . at the core of lssig s result is the assumption that the operator content of the system is simply .",

    "the above numerical values of @xmath92 do not look that simple , but are of the same order of magnitude as we might expect .",
    "simple minded power counting in eq.([kpz - eq ] ) with @xmath8 and @xmath97 , suggests that the corrections to scaling are strong ; that the curvature operator @xmath98 is irrelevant , but not by much , @xmath99 , and that the leading skewness operator @xmath100 scales with @xmath101 .",

    "the most important result of this paper is that the amplitude ratio s @xmath141 and @xmath120 of the stationary state moments converge to the same value in the kk and bcsos model , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . at the start of this project we expected that the skewness , @xmath139 , would be the most sensitive parameter to test the universality of the kpz stationary state properties in @xmath26 . however , @xmath139 is numerically much more stable than the surface roughness critical exponent @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath139 takes the same value in the kk and bcsos models , and does not vary significantly in the bcsos model with the temperature parameter @xmath33 ; in contrast to the strong variation in the microscopic measures of particle - hole asymmetry . the @xmath26 kpz stationary state skewness is universal , unlike @xmath22 where it is tunable .",
    "the differences in the numerical values for @xmath7 in the kk and bcsos model have been a puzzle for a long time .",
    "the corrections to fss scaling in the kk model are small , compared to the mc noise and point clearly to the kkl value @xmath8 .",
    "the fss corrections to scaling in the bcsos model are large .",
    "the stationary state roughness exponent converges naively but systematically to a smaller value @xmath142 .",
    "however , our fss analysis shows that the data is consistent with @xmath8 if the leading corrections to scaling exponents are dominated by @xmath10 for the even moments and @xmath96 for the odd ones .",
    "these values are different , but in the same range as predicted by simple minded power counting .",
    "this is an important issue , because different values of @xmath7 in the kk and bcsos models , and variations with @xmath33 in the latter , would imply non - universality of @xmath26 kpz scaling , and open up the possibility of e.g. , a continuously varying @xmath7 .",
    "our data suggest one single kpz fixed point with unique exponents .",
