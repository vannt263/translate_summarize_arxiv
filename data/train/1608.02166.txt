    "the objective of this article is to address the analysis of time series using a method known as the square wave method ( swm ) , which was introduced previously for the analysis of signals and images @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    by using the swm ,",
    "consideration is given to the analysis of time series , for which the time interval between any two consecutive values in the series analyzed remains constant .",
    "if a given time series can be considered to be an adequate representation of a signal during a certain time lapse between an initial instant @xmath0 and a final instant @xmath1 , then the analysis of that series , using the swm , is also an analysis of that signal , within that period of time .",
    "the results obtained after analyzing time series with the swm are expressed in the frequency domain in a clear , precise and concise way by using a previously introduced mathematical tool , known as the square wave transform ( swt ) [ 1 ] .",
    "each time series is composed of a sequence of values",
    ". one significant characteristic of the swm is that it takes into account the order in which those values appear .",
    "the analysis process of a time series , conducted with the swm , leads to certain basic components , specific trains of square waves , from which the time series analyzed can be entirely reconstructed .",
    "that is precisely why if a time series may be considered to be a adequate representation of a signal , the analysis of that series using the swm can also be a valid analysis of that signal .",
    "that significant characteristic of the swm makes it quite different from other valuable methods , statistical methods in particular , used for the analysis of time series @xcite .",
    "the swm is reviewed in section 2 to show the relevance of this method as a mathematical tool for the analysis of time series .",
    "this information has been included here to provide a solid basis for anyone who has not read previous articles on the swm .",
    "the procedure to be used to analyze a time series using the swm is presented in this section .",
    "suppose that every quarter of a second ( ) a measurement is made of the difference in the electric potential between two points ( point 1 and point 2 ) . to simplify the explanation of the procedure used ,",
    "suppose that the values measured , expressed in millivolts ( ) , have been rounded off ( for didactic purposes ) to whole values .",
    "( later on , the values will no longer be rounded off . )",
    "let us admit that the sequence of values measured in millivolts , during , is the following : @xmath2    of course , the positive values in this sequence imply that in each case the electric potential of point 1 is greater than that of point 2 . likewise , the negative values in the above sequence imply that in each case the electric potential of point 1 is less than that of point 2 .",
    "the value of 0 in that sequence of values implies that , under the given precision , the values of the electric potentials of points 1 and 2 are equal .",
    "the values of this time series are shown in figure  [ f1 ] .        according to the swm , each of the measured values in the time series considered",
    "can be approximated very precisely by adding up 8 values .",
    "each of these 8 values is located in a corresponding train of square waves .",
    "reference is made here to the 8 added values and to the 8 corresponding trains of square waves because in this case the time series considered is made up of 8 measured values .",
    "if the sequence were composed of 1,000 measured values , it would be necessary to add up the 1,000 values situated in the 1,000 corresponding trains of square waves , to approximate each of those measured values .",
    "in general , if that time series is made up of @xmath3 values , such that @xmath4 , then to approximate each of those values , the @xmath3 values situated in @xmath3 corresponding trains of square waves must be added up .",
    "an explanation is provided below of how to discover 1 ) what values must be added up to approximate each measured value ; 2 ) which trains of square waves are being referred to ; and 3 ) where the values that must be summed up are located in those trains of square waves .    consider the case for which @xmath5 , specified in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] illustrates that case .",

    "it may be considered to be an 8 by 8 matrix .",
    "look first at the eighth row , corresponding to the eighth train of square waves @xmath7 to be analyzed . in that row , the sequence @xmath8{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}c_8{\\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{-c}_{8 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}$ ] corresponds to one square wave in @xmath7 ; @xmath9 corresponds to the first semi - wave of that square wave , and @xmath10 to the second square wave .",
    "which one of those semi - waves is positive and which is negative depends on the value to be computed ( as specified below ) for @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is positive , then the first semi - wave will be positive , and the second will be negative .",
    "if , however , @xmath9 is negative , then the first semi - wave will be negative , and the second will be positive .",
    "note that in the last row , that of @xmath7 , there are exactly 4 square waves ; that is , those 4 square waves _",
    "fit _ in ( the total duration of the interval @xmath11 during which time the values of the time series analyzed were measured ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath12 corresponding to that train of square waves @xmath7 is equal to the number of square waves that _ fit _ in the time unit ; therefore , @xmath13 .    the wavelength of the next to the last train of square waves @xmath14 ( corresponding to the next to the last line in figure  [ f2 ] ) , is twice the wavelength of the train of square waves @xmath7 .",
    "the wavelength of the second to the last train of square waves @xmath15 is triple the wavelength of @xmath7 , and so on successively .",
    "hence , the wavelength @xmath16 , the train of square waves in the first row in figure  [ f2 ] , is 8 times greater than the wavelength of @xmath7 .    given that the wavelength in @xmath14 is twice that of @xmath7 , the frequency @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath14 is half that of @xmath12 : @xmath18 . in figure",
    "[ f2 ] , it can be seen that one square wave in @xmath14 _ fits _ exactly in the unit of time ; one square wave in @xmath14 is represented in figure  [ f2 ] as : @xmath8{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}\\;\\ ; c_7{\\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}\\;\\ ; c_7 { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}-c_7 { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}-c_7 { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}$ ] .    to understand the formalism used , one may carefully verify at least some of the above results .",
    "thus , for example , consider the following equation : @xmath19{1/2}{\\hertz } $ ] .",

    "for @xmath20 , exactly one square wave _ fits _ in the entire lapse in @xmath22 , as is clearly shown in figure  [ f2 ] ; and exactly one semi - wave in @xmath20 _ fits _ in the unit of time .",

    "in the example discussed , 4 values were measured per second . in other words , for the sampling frequency @xmath25 , this equation is valid : @xmath26 ; the following relation between @xmath12 and @xmath25 is also valid : @xmath27 .",

    ", the interval @xmath6 was divided into 8 equal subintervals because the time series analyzed is made up of exactly 8 equal values .",
    "if that time series were composed of @xmath39 values , then the interval @xmath11 would be divided into 50,000 equal subintervals . in general , if the time series to be analyzed is made up of @xmath3 values , where @xmath4 , then @xmath11 is divided into @xmath3 equal subintervals .",
    "first , look at the left column in figure  [ f2 ] , and add up the elements in that column , following the order indicated by the vertical arrow pointing down ( at the right of the figure ) and the result is made equal to the first value , , of that time series .",

    "thus , the following equation is obtained : @xmath44    observe that @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath10 are respectively the values of the trains of square waves @xmath16 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath20 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath7 , at the midpoint of the second subinterval of @xmath11",

    "the fourth , fifth , sixth and seventh equations are obtained using the same type of procedure .",
    "finally , that procedure is applied to the eighth column in  [ f2 ] , and the following equation is obtained : @xmath47    observe that @xmath32 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath37 , @xmath46 , and @xmath10 are respectively the values of the trains of square waves for @xmath16 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath20 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath7 , at the midpoint of the eighth subinterval of @xmath11 .",

    "the algebraic sum corresponding to the @xmath55-th subinterval ( @xmath56 ) must be equal to the @xmath55-th value of the time series considered .    in general , this approach can be applied to analyze any time series composed of @xmath3 measured values , such that @xmath4 , during a specific time interval @xmath11 expressed in seconds .",
    "it is accepted that the lapse between two consecutive values in the time series analyzed will remain constant .    the frequency of the measurement of values in the time series ( or the _ sampling frequency _",
    "@xmath25 ) is the number of values measured per second ( the time unit ) .",
    "therefore , the number @xmath3 of measured values in a time interval @xmath11 can be expressed as : @xmath57    if the time series is composed of @xmath3 values , the interval @xmath11 must be divided into @xmath3 subintervals of equal duration .    to analyze that time series with the swm , it is essential to construct an @xmath58-matrix like that of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "the last row in that matrix corresponds to the _",

    "thus , the number of square waves in @xmath59 per time unit ( @xmath60 ) can be expressed as follows :    @xmath61    the next to the last row of this @xmath58-matrix is that of the train of square waves @xmath62 ; each square wave is represented as @xmath8{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{c}_{n-1 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{c}_{n-1 } \\allowbreak { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{-c}_{n-1 } \\allowbreak { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{-c}_{n-1 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}$ ] .",
    "it can be seen that the length of each of the square waves composing @xmath62 is twice that of the wave of each square wave composing @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the frequency @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath62 is equal to half of frequency @xmath65 corresponding to @xmath66 : @xmath67    the second to the last row in this @xmath58-matrix corresponds to the train of square waves @xmath68 . each square wave in @xmath68 can be represented as @xmath8{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{c}_{n-2 } \\allowbreak   { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{c}_{n-2 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{c}_{n-2 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{-c}_{n-2}{\\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{-c}_{n-2}{\\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}{-c}_{n-2 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{90}{$\\dabar@\\dabar@\\dabar@$}}$ ] .",
    "it can be observed that the length of each of the square waves composing @xmath68 is three times that of the wave of each square wave composing @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the frequency @xmath69 corresponding to @xmath68 is equal to a third of the frequency @xmath65 corresponding to @xmath66 : @xmath70    in general , the frequency @xmath71 corresponding to the @xmath55-th train of square waves @xmath72 will be expressed as follows : @xmath73    the values of the coefficients @xmath74 are computed with a procedure like that used to compute @xmath75 , in the example analyzed of a time series composed of a sequence of 8 values .    to begin with , the algebraic sum of all the elements making up the first column of the @xmath58-matrix",

    "next , the algebraic sum of all the elements composing the second column of the @xmath58-matrix is made equal to the second value of the time series to be analyzed .",
    "and so on up to the algebraic sum of all the elements of the @xmath3-th column of the @xmath58-matrix , which is made equal to the last value ( @xmath3-th value ) of the time series to be analyzed .    in this way",
    ", a system of @xmath3 linear algebraic equations is obtained .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 , which are the unknowns of that system of equations , can be computed .",
    "an algorithm to make it easier to determine the system of linear algebraic equations will be described in section 3 .",
    "this system of equations must be solved whenever the swm is used to analyze a time series .",

    "initially , this system of equations can be presented as follows :    @xmath120    note that in the above system of equations , the first subscript of each coefficient @xmath55 , for @xmath121 , indicates the order of the equation itself in which that coefficient appears ; that is , the first , second , third , @xmath98 or eighth equation and the second coefficient @xmath100 , for @xmath122 specifies the order in which that coefficient is present in the given equation ( first , second third , @xmath98 or eighth ) .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath123 is a coefficient present in the fifth of the above equations and it appears in the fourth place of that equation .",
    "each coefficient @xmath99 of the 64 coefficients in the above system of equations can then be replaced by @xmath124 or by @xmath125 , as established in 1 ) , 2 ) , 3 ) and 4 ) .",
    "when proceeding in this way , the system of linear algebraic equations ( 1 ) mentioned in section 2 is obtained :    @xmath126    in this system of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) there are only 8 coefficients : @xmath77 , for @xmath29 .",
    "hence this procedure makes it possible to compute , for each time series composed of a sequence of @xmath3 measured values , the values of the @xmath3 coefficients @xmath77 , for @xmath29 , appearing in the system of @xmath3 linear algebraic equations that is generated when analyzing the time series by using the swm .",
    "equation ( [ eq3 ] ) makes it possible to compute the frequency of each of the @xmath3 trains of square waves @xmath127 .",
    "the objective of this section is to emphasize the following characteristic of the swm as a tool for the analysis of time series : the method remains applicable even when the changes in the value of the variable from which the sequence of samples is obtained are entirely unforeseeable ; and the approximation provided for the measured values has a very high quality ( i. e. , the difference between any of the measured values and the corresponding computed value is very slight ) .",
    "a random number generator ( the mrng @xcite ) was used to generate @xmath128 values between @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "when using the mrng , the probability of any particular digit @xmath131 appearing is the same : @xmath132 .    to generate each one of those 10,000 numerical values ,",
    "the following was done : if the first digit generated by the mrng was between 0 and 4 , inclusive , it was admitted that the numerical value generated ( nvg ) was negative .",
    "if , however , that digit was between 5 and 9 , inclusive , it was accepted that the nvg was positive .",
    "the second digit of those generated was taken as the first digit of the whole part of the nvg .",
    "the third digit generated was taken as the second digit of the whole part of the nvg .",
    "the fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh and eighth digits generated were taken as the first , second , third , fourth and fifth digits , respectively , of the decimal part of the nvg .",
    "each of the remaining values in the sequence of 10,000 numerical values to be analyzed with the swm was obtained using the same type of procedure .",
    "of course , a different sequence of 8 digits was generated by the mrng to be used to obtain each of those 10,000 numerical values .",
    "it was supposed that the sequence of 10,000 values obtained by using the mrng corresponded to a time series of values measured during a lapse of 5 seconds ( ) with a sampling frequency of . in other words ,",
    "the mrng was used to simulate the 10,000 consecutive measurements of a time series composed of a sequence of 10,000 numerical values .",
    "the _ simulated _ time series described above is displayed in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the first 100 values of that numerical series of 10,000 are shown below : + @size8.5@mathfonts    [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      + a partial display of the results obtained by using the swm is presented in figure [ f6 ] .        the complete specification of the time series of 10,000 numerical values analyzed by the swm and the corresponding sequence of 10,000 dyads of the type ( @xmath28 , @xmath77 ) , for @xmath133 , can be found in supplementary material available in the official page of the group @xcite .",
    "the approximation achieved ( with the swm ) to each of the numerical values of the time series is outstanding .",
    "@xmath134 , for @xmath135 , will designate the @xmath55-th of those values , and @xmath136 will refer to the corresponding approximation obtained by the swm .",
    "@xmath137 is the absolute value of the difference between the two values .",
    "of course , there will be 10,000 absolute values of this type .",
    "the maximum of those absolute values can be computed : @xmath138",
    "consideration has been given to the application of the swm to time series such that the value of the time interval between any two consecutive values remains constant .",
    "specialists in a certain type of signal usually have the necessary tools to determine the minimum sampling frequency required to obtain a sequence of measured values of that type of signal , during a specific time interval , such that the sequence of values , or time series , can be considered to be an acceptable digital version of that signal , in that interval .",
    "suppose that a particular time series is obtained by using that minimum sampling frequency or above .",
    "in that case , the analysis with the swm of that time series is also a valid analysis of the corresponding signal , in that interval .          1 .   a general systematic approach for the use of the swm for the analysis of functions of @xmath3 variables , for @xmath4 ; and 2 .   ways in which the use of the swm can contribute to 1 ) the elimination of noise in different types of signals , and 2 ) the compression of information .",
