    "energy harvesting from motion is a means to power wireless sensor nodes in constructions , machinery and on the human body @xcite .",
    "a vibration energy harvester contains a proof mass whose relative motion with respect to a frame drives a transducer that generates electrical power .",
    "linear resonant devices are superior when driven by harmonic vibrations at their resonant frequency , but perform poorly for off - resonance conditions . as real vibrations may display a rich spectral content , sometimes of broadband nature , there has been considerable interest in using nonlinear suspensions to shape the spectrum of the harvester s response to better suit the vibrations @xcite . the wider spectral response of nonlinear devices is expected to be beneficial for broadband vibrations .",
    "the studies so far indicate some advantages of nonlinearities for broad - banded vibrations , but little is known about which conditions make a nonlinear harvester favorable compared to a linear one .",
    "this is due to lack of adequate theory and due to the studies being concerned about specific experimental or numerical examples of nonlinear harvesters that are compared to specific examples of linear harvesters that could have been chosen differently .",
    "furthermore , several studies do not consider the role of electrical loading which is known to have a dramatic influence on the consequences of mechanical nonlinearities for the output power @xcite .",
    "white noise is widely used in physics and engineering @xcite , and is also important in studying broadband energy harvesting @xcite .",
    "if the vibration spectrum is flat over the frequency range of the harvester , the harvester itself provides a cut - off making the infinite bandwidth of white noise a meaningful idealization .",
    "white noise approximates colored noise with correlation time sufficiently short compared to the characteristic times of the system .",
    "aspects of a nonlinear harvester s performance hinging on a finite correlation time and not present for white noise are , albeit interesting , necessarily relying on a limited vibration bandwidth .",
    "therefore white noise is a good case for investigating broadband performance .",
    "here we investigate theoretically the behavior of mechanically nonlinear energy harvesters driven by a gaussian white noise acceleration .",
    "we derive rigorous upper bounds on the output power for arbitrary elastic potential and show that subject to mild restrictions on the device parameters , it is possible to find a linear device that performs equally well as the upper bound .",
    "we give a compact expression for the output power that we use to numerically investigate the weak coupling limit of harvesters for different quartic polynomial potentials taking electrical loading fully into account .",
    "an energy harvester model that is nt technology specific is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehsystem ] . the corresponding state space equations with a linear electromechanical transducer and a nonlinear mechanical suspension",
    "can be written @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the proof mass , @xmath2 its relative displacement , @xmath3 its velocity , @xmath4 the open - circuit internal energy , @xmath5 the transducer - electrode charge , @xmath6 the output voltage , @xmath7 the current , @xmath8 the damping coefficient , @xmath9 the load resistance , @xmath10 the clamped capacitance and @xmath11 the transduction factor .",
    "the device - frame acceleration @xmath12 is gaussian white noise with a two - sided spectral density @xmath13 .",
    "the equations can represent a piezoelectric or an electrostatic energy harvester .",
    "an electromagnetic harvester gives the same mathematical structure , but different physical interpretation .",
    "we use charge as the independent variable @xcite .",
    "using voltage instead is physically equivalent and also common , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "ensemble averages with respect to the stationary distribution generated by the process ( [ eq : sp1]-[eq : sp3 ] ) will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the mean output power @xmath15 will be our main object of interest .",
    "a number of other expressions for @xmath16 immediately follow by using stationarity , ( [ eq : sp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sp3 ] ) .",
    "we will use some of these expressions without giving the derivation .",
    "all results for linear systems are exact and taken from @xcite unless said otherwise .    from ( [ eq : sp3 ] ) , @xmath17 .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : sp2 ] ) is @xmath18 and can then be dropped in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "this is the weak coupling limit , which in the stationary state has the reduced probability density @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a normalization constant @xcite .",
    "we denote expectations in this limit by @xmath22 .",
    "in this section , we prove that a previously known lemma on the mechanical input power of linear harvesters also encompasses mechanically nonlinear ones , and discuss its consequences .",
    "we then show that known asymptotic formulas for large or small load resistances are upper bounds on output power .",
    "finally we find improved bounds that are asymptotically correct in both limits and compare to exact results for a linear harvester .",
    "the important observation that the mean input power is @xmath23 was made in @xcite where it was proved for linear harvesters . for our nonlinear system and @xmath24 ,",
    "all power is dissipated in the damper , ( [ eq : wst0 ] ) implies the equipartition theorem , and @xmath25 . for general @xmath11 , consider the input energy @xmath26 over a time interval .",
    "when the actually continuously differentiable @xmath27 is modeled as white noise , the appropriate stochastic representation of the energy is a stratonovich integral @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an ito integral and has zero expectation @xcite .",
    "the input - energy expectation is then @xmath31 which yields the stated expression for @xmath32 .",
    "the observation means that @xmath33 is an efficiency that should be maximized , as opposed to linear narrow - band harvesting where power transfer is maximized .",
    "it also implies a power balance @xmath34    for linear harvesters , @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the transducer electromechanical coupling factor , @xmath38 is the open - circuit stiffness and @xmath39 is the open - circuit quality factor@xcite .",
    "hence , it is impossible to improve significantly on a linear harvester that is already very efficient .",
    "the device in @xcite for example , has @xmath40 resulting in @xmath41 .",
    "the great number of harvesters , especially those with small volume , that perform substantially below their theoretical maximum @xcite , suggests that the weak coupling regime nevertheless has great practical relevance .",
    "the load resistance determines the electrical time scale @xmath42 distinguishing different regimes of operation .",
    "when @xmath43 is the fastest scale , i.e. @xmath44 , we have @xcite @xmath45 from ( [ eq : sp3 ] ) , it is readily proved that @xmath46 .",
    "one can also show that @xmath47 .",
    "hence , both asymptotic relations in ( [ eq : powsmalltau ] ) are upper bounds on the output power .",
    "we note that the bounds are valid for any @xmath4 that permits a stationary distribution and that the output power is otherwise independent of @xmath4 when @xmath48 .    when the electrical time scale is the slowest in the system , i.e. when @xmath49 , we have @xcite @xmath50 the leftmost asymptotic formula in ( [ eq : powlargetau ] ) is also an upper bound .",
    "this is seen by using ( [ eq : sp3 ] ) to find @xmath51 which gives the inequality when dropping the second term .",
    "the rightmost asymptotic formula in ( [ eq : powlargetau ] ) need not be an upper bound as can be inferred already from linear theory .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : powlargetau ] ) , in contrast to ( [ eq : powsmalltau ] ) , is strongly dependent on @xmath4 as it is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "the maximum power as a function of @xmath43 must necessarily be found at an intermediate value of @xmath43 between the small-@xmath43 and large-@xmath43 regimes . since the output power is respectively insensitive and sensitive to the nature of @xmath4 in these two regimes , the degree to which the maximum power can be improved by mechanical nonlinearities is an open question .",
    "we now address the potential benefits of nonlinear devices by deriving improved power bounds and comparing to linear behavior .",
    "define @xmath53 and find the values of the constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 that minimize @xmath56 .",
    "eliminate covariances between @xmath2 and @xmath5 using @xmath57 and use @xmath58 and ( [ eq : powxq ] ) to write the minimum value as @xmath59 next , use this to eliminate the variance of @xmath5 in ( [ eq : powxq ] ) and rearrange to obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 we see that ( [ eq : ubound ] ) agrees with ( [ eq : powsmalltau ] ) and ( [ eq : powlargetau ] ) in their respective limits and is a tighter bound .    the quantity @xmath62 can be used to eliminate the displacement variance in ( [ eq : ubound ] ) . using @xmath63 we find a _",
    "lower _ bound on @xmath64 which we substitute back into the power balance equation to obtain @xmath65 where the new bound is @xmath66 @xmath67 is manifestly less than @xmath32 and is asymptotically approaching the exact result at both the extreme limits of @xmath43 .",
    "we can interpret @xmath68 as the root - mean - square frequency of the spectrum @xcite of the displacement @xmath69 .",
    "this follows from representing the variances in terms of the spectral densities @xmath70 and @xmath71 of @xmath72 and @xmath3 respectively , that is @xmath73    the most optimistic estimate of output power permitted by ( @xmath74 ) is found for load resistances such that @xmath75 and is @xmath76 this can be compared to the exact output power of an optimally loaded linear harvester which is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the open - circuit resonance .",
    "the two power expressions differ only in terms in the denominators : @xmath79 in ( [ eq : pu2opt ] ) v. @xmath80 in ( [ eq : plinopt ] ) . with",
    "all other parameters except load resistance held equal , a linear system can therefore be made to perform better than , worse than or equally to the bound depending on its stiffness .",
    "it will meet the performance of the bound if its stiffness is such that @xmath81 .",
    "the only fundamental restriction on the linear system is that it is stable , i.e. has @xmath82 @xcite which is equivalent to @xmath83 .",
    "hence , a linear device meeting the bound is realizable if @xmath84 _ therefore nonlinear harvesters are not fundamentally better than linear ones . _",
    "harvesters that have their spectrum shaped by nonlinear design of their proof mass suspension will , like linear resonant devices , typically be designed to have @xmath85 much less than the characteristic frequencies of proof - mass motion in order to maximize performance .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath86 to be a typical case for such nonlinear devices . a corresponding linear system performing equally to the bound , will then have @xmath87 .",
    "that is , its resonance lies within the frequency range of the nonlinear harvester s spectrum .",
    "we note that failure to fulfill the criterion ( [ eq : lincrit ] ) because of the second term on the r.h.s , corresponds to coupling strong enough that a linear device is not an alternative due to lack of stability or due to being only marginally stable .",
    "we would expect this situation for truly nonresonant devices with low damping . for @xmath11 approaching this limit from below , one has the high - efficiency situation discussed in section [ sec : powerbalance ] even with considerable damping ( moderate @xmath39 for the linear device ) .",
    "while ( [ eq : ubound2 ] ) is always an upper bound on the output power , it is quite possible that this bound is a poor approximation and considerably overestimates the actual output power .",
    "we might expect this situation when the spectrum @xmath88 has multiple peaks widely separated in frequency such as for quartic bistable potentials @xcite .",
    "if so , the actual performance can be met by a linear device with @xmath78 larger than @xmath89 by an amount in correspondance to the degree of overestimate .",
    "this has to be checked for each particular case .",
    "the criterion ( [ eq : lincrit ] ) is a sufficient , but not necessary , condition for the realizability of a linear harvester that performs equally well or better than a harvester characterized by @xmath68 .",
    "we now consider how to directly calculate the output power for concrete examples . from ( [ eq : sp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sp3 ] ) it follows that @xmath90 . inserting this expression into @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 i.e. that the output power is proportional to the laplace transform @xmath93 of the velocity autocorrelation function .    in the weak coupling limit @xmath19 , we can approximate @xmath93 by its value @xmath94 for @xmath24 to obtain the leading order .",
    "@xmath94 can be found from the transition probability by solving the fokker - planck equation corresponding to ( [ eq : sp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sp2 ] ) with @xmath24 , i.e. the kramers equation @xcite .    without pursuing it",
    "further , we remark that an alternative method to calculate the output power , and therefore also @xmath94 , would be to find a _",
    "stationary _ solution of the fokker - planck equation for the energy harvester@xcite in the weak coupling limit and use @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",

    "the longest time scale is that of interwell transitions as given by kramers rate problem @xcite and the large-@xmath43 asymptotics is only reached for @xmath43 values far above the optimum .",

    "the maximum power is obtained for a negative value of @xmath116 , i.e with a bi - stable potential , like demonstrated for a fixed load and colored noise in @xcite .",
    "but , as the bound corresponds to a linear device with @xmath142 , more power can be obtained with a linear device .",
