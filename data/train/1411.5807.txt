    "even before the neutron was discovered , based on the @xmath0 decay explained successfully as a quantum tunneling effect across the coulomb barrier , gamow proposed that alpha particles ( @xmath3he nuclei ) are the constituents of atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "indeed , alpha clusters are present in light nuclei ( such as , e.g. , @xmath1c ) as effective degrees of freedom and lead to large intrinsic deformation of their nuclear distributions , which in some cases lead to polyhedral symmetric structures : an equilateral triangle for @xmath1c , tetrahedron for @xmath4o , trigonal bipyramid for @xmath5ne , octahedron pentagonal bipyramid for @xmath6 mg , hexagonal bipyramid for @xmath7si , etc .",
    "@xcite , ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) .     a triangle hitting the wall : @xmath1c pictured as a triangle of three @xmath0 particles ( left ) colliding with a heavy ion drawn as a round flat object ( middle ) .",
    "the triangular shape of the fireball yields a triangular pattern of particle emission after the collision ( right ) . ]",
    "when such a clustered geometric object , say @xmath1c , hits a large nucleus such as @xmath2pb at almost the speed of light ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : triang - wall ] ) , the shape of the created fireball in the transverse plane reflects ( up to random fluctuations ) the deformation of the light nucleus and effectively implements the almost instantaneous collapse of the collective wave function  @xcite .",
    "as the hit nucleus is large , the fireball is abundant enough to evolve collectively , much as in collisions of two heavy nuclei at rhic or the lhc . because of the initial deformation , harmonic flow develops , leading to very specific and measurable signatures in the transverse momentum distributions of the detected hadrons produced in the collision .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system develops large triangular flow , increasing with the multiplicity of the number the produced hadrons .",
    "traditionally , it has been assessed that only some very bulk information on the nuclear structure content could be probed by ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our calculations show , however , that certain very distinct geometric features , such as the @xmath0-clustering in the nuclear ground state wave function , could indeed be traced significantly by properly analyzing the multiparticle spectrum in the final state  @xcite .",
    "this talk returns to this remarkable link between the lowest energy nuclear structure and the highest - energy heavy - light - ions collisions , emphasizing some important aspects of this connection , mostly from the nuclear physics point of view .",
    "this is intended for specialists from either the @xmath8cluster and the relativistic heavy - ion communities who might be unfamiliar with the ideas of the other side .    in order to motivate the presentation below ,",
    "let us review the basic elements needed to describe the collisions between two nuclei , a+b .",
    "let the two nuclei a and b be characterized by wave functions satisfying @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the collision at invariant cm energy @xmath11 , in their initial ground state @xmath12 and @xmath13 , can be described by the total hamiltonian , @xmath14 where additivity of the elementary energy - dependent nn interactions is assumed , @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting an optical potential .",
    "the basic tool of our analysis is given by the glauber formalism ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which gives the density @xmath17 of inelastic collisions in the transverse plane , @xmath18 , for the a+b reaction in terms of the elementary nn density , @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , in the binary collision model ( the popular wounded nucleon model applied in our studies includes the same ingredients ) @xmath20 \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : glauber - ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the inelastic cross sections for nn and ab , respectively , and @xmath23 .",
    "this formula shows that we need a knowledge of the nuclear wave functions and the interaction between nucleons in the different nuclei .",
    "this is a purely hadronic picture of the collision process and the only partonic underlying features are hidden under @xmath19 which is usually obtained phenomenologically .",
    "the @xmath0 particle is a @xmath24 nucleus , which in the ground state has the quantum numbers @xmath25 .",
    "its charge is @xmath26 and mass @xmath27 with the binding energy @xmath28 .",
    "there are no excited states below the @xmath29 or @xmath30he+n thresholds , and the nucleon separation energy is @xmath31 .",
    "the size information is obtained from the electron scattering , where the elastic @xmath32 differential cross section is given by @xmath33 deviating from the point - like rutherford result .",
    "the charge form factor can be well fitted by  @xcite @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and vanishes at @xmath37 , see left fig .",
    "[ fig : ff - he4 ] .",
    "the corresponding charge mean squared radius is @xmath38 .",
    "the nucleon distribution is obtained by unfolding the charge distribution with the nucleon ( proton ) charge form factor @xmath39 , @xmath40 : @xmath41 and assuming isospin invariance . then the baryon density @xmath42 . normalized charge and baryon densities",
    "are depicted in right fig .",
    "[ fig : ff - he4 ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath43 .",
    "a good and simple approximation for the wave function in the cm system , as far as the form factor is concerned for @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff - em - alpha ] ) , is given by the shell model as a @xmath45 state , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalized antisymmetrizer and @xmath48 is the cm . the ground state probability @xmath49 can be constructed by randomly generating 12 gaussian variables describing @xmath50 of the four particles , and then relocating the cm @xmath51 to the origin .",
    "more realistic wave functions can be achieved by including a short - distance correlation features , say a hard core of size @xmath52 , by excluding configurations with @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "this simple approach will be pursued below for the @xmath1c ground state wave function .",
    "further improvements incorporate asymptotic long - distance cluster decomposition conditions on the total wave function into @xmath54h+@xmath54h , @xmath30h+n or @xmath30he+p subsystems  @xcite , implying exponential fall - offs with proper separation wave numbers .",
    "the study of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction , involving eight nucleons , has been a continuous playground in cluster model studies  @xcite .",
    "the total wave function is written as @xmath55 , where the relative wave function satisfies a rgm equation containing a direct term which is _ local _ and corresponds to a folding structure  @xcite very much like the nucleus - nucleus sao paulo potential  @xcite , and an exchange term which is non - local and short range .",
    "the direct electromagnetic interaction between the two @xmath0 particles can be written as a folding potential , leading in the overlapping region to the screening of the pure coulomb interaction below an elementarity radius , @xmath56 , @xmath57 the leading exchange interaction corresponds to separating one neutron or proton , leaving @xmath30h or @xmath30he behind , respectively , and is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 the nucleon separation energy .",
    "using the nuclear form factor , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ff - he4 ] , we immediately see from fig .  [ vaa - em ] that @xmath0 particles interact effectively as if they were point - like for distances larger than @xmath60 .",
    "we call this _ effective elementarity _ ,",
    "a feature that entitles us to treat interactions between @xmath0 particles as point - like objects above this separation   particle , the longest range non - em interaction is of van der waals nature and is given by two - pion - exchange , a tiny effect  @xcite .",
    "note that this notion of elementarity has to do with the interaction ; the simple overlap integral @xmath61 for @xmath62 is not the relevant property . ] and disregard the short - range exchange term .",
    "one interpretation of the @xmath0 clustering is based on the fact that in @xmath63 nuclei @xmath0 particles are on the average packed at a larger distance than @xmath56 , and thus preserve their identity .",

    "here @xmath73 and @xmath74 are coulomb wave functions and @xmath75 is the sommerfeld parameter and @xmath76 the bohr radius . due to the bose statistics , we have @xmath77 .",
    "the partial wave expansion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : famp ] ) , is limited in practice to @xmath78 , with @xmath79 denoting the range of the non - electromagnetic interaction , since classically @xmath80 and there is no scattering for @xmath81 .",
    "below the first inelastic @xmath82li+p and @xmath82b+n thresholds , which take place at @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 . using an energy independent boundary condition at a",
    "given cut - off radius @xmath56 we get for @xmath85 ( s - wave ) @xmath86 from which we can fit the s - wave phase - shift with the parameters  @xcite @xmath87 which is rather good , see fig .",
    "[ ps - alpha - alpha ] .",
    "thus , all the necessary information is encoded in these parameters , in harmony with an effective elementarity of @xmath0 particles and the irrelevance of the short distance characteristics .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath0 particles remain at distances larger than @xmath88 , we may ignore all the substructure details , including the exchange terms .",
    "that way one can sidestep a full _ ab initio _ calculation with 8 nucleons .      the steep rise of the phase - shift starting at zero corresponds to the @xmath89be resonance , which arises as a pole of the s matrix in the second riemann sheet .",
    "the asymptotics @xmath90 with the complex momentum @xmath91 gives a complex energy @xmath92 , so that the turning point , fulfilling @xmath93 , is rather large @xmath94 , yet tunneling through the barrier occurs .",
    "a further interesting aspect is that if the coulomb force were removed above @xmath95 , the @xmath96be resonance would then become a stable weakly bound state with a binding energy given by @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "[ vaa - em ] ) , a fairly large radius , @xmath98 , and the asymptotic coefficient of the normalized reduced wave function , @xmath99 of @xmath100 .",
    "the effective elementarity of @xmath0 particles has far reaching consequences .",
    "the most clear signatures for @xmath0 clustering in nuclei are seen in the binding energies and form factors . already in 1966",
    "harrington proposed to treat @xmath101 as a bound state of three elementary @xmath0 particles  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 particle is very tightly bound , a hint for clustering for @xmath63 nuclei was given by the bonding approximation  @xcite , @xmath102 where @xmath103 for @xmath1c , @xmath4o , @xmath5ne , @xmath6 mg , @xmath7si , etc .",
    ", respectively , yielding @xmath104 ( we stop plotting at @xmath105 since @xmath106 can always be adjusted onwards ) .",
    "this corresponds a next - neighbors interaction of closely packed spheres ( see @xcite for pictures illustrating the polyhedral configurations )  ne would require @xmath107 for this interpretation but that gives a worse binding . ] .",
    "the result of the fit can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] ( left ) .",
    "one drawback of this approach is that the fit does not reproduce the simplest @xmath108 case , which corresponds to @xmath89be .    in a different scheme we just count the numbers of pairs , triplets and quartets , corresponding to two-,three- and four body forces , and the energy reads @xmath109 a fit for @xmath63 nuclei gives @xmath110 .",
    "the result can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] ( right ) , with a mean standard deviation of @xmath111 per nucleon .",
    "again , the meaning of @xmath108 is particularly subtle since , as we have shown , this corresponds to the @xmath89be case which is unbound by @xmath112 while direct extrapolation of the general formula for @xmath113 implies @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath89be is an exceptionally large system which becomes very sensitive to the long range coulomb interaction .",
