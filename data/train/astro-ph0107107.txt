    "the goal of the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey is to understand the evolution of galaxies to @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we present the luminosity function ( henceforth the lf ) for galaxies in the region of the hubble deep field - north ( henceforth the hdf ) ( williams _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) from our very complete redshift survey .",
    "first we discuss the completeness of the observed sample in @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we describe the derivation of the rest frame luminosity function in @xmath17 in some detail in  [ analysis ] .",
    "we then briefly indicate the differences in procedure for rest frame 2400 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss the evolution with redshift of @xmath4 ( the characteristic luminosity of the lf ) , the co - moving number density and the co - moving luminosity density for various galaxy spectral groupings from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "we then compare our results to poggianti s ( 1997 ) models for galaxy spectral evolution in  [ poggianti_comp ] . in  [ mass ] we compute the total stellar mass in galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "comparisons with the results obtained by previous redshift surveys are given in ",
    "[ compare ] .    throughout , our goal , given the sample size in hand , is the simplest possible analysis , even if at some sacrifice of accuracy , since errors arising from the small sample size will dominate over any limitations imposed here through use of a relatively unsophisticated analysis .",
    "an appendix demonstrates that the derived luminosity densities are very robust .    as in earlier papers in this series",
    ", we adopt the cosmology h@xmath21 km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . over the redshift interval of most interest , a flat universe with @xmath25 and a hubble constant of h@xmath26 km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22gives galaxy luminosities very close to those derived below .",
    "additional comments regarding modifying the adopted cosmology are given in ",
    "[ cosmology ] .",
    "we use luminosities rather than magnitudes . by luminosity ,",
    "we mean the quantity @xmath27 with units of w at a particular wavelength in the rest frame .",

    "the redshift survey of galaxies in the region of the hdf by cohen _",
    "et al . _  ( 2000 ) ( henceforth c00 ) , supplemented in cohen ( 2001 ) , is the sample used here .",
    "this survey strives for a complete set of redshifts for all objects with @xmath28 in the hdf itself , and for objects with @xmath29 in the flanking fields within a diameter of 8 arcmin centered on the hdf .",
    "extremely high completeness ( 95% for the hdf and @xmath30% for the flanking fields ) was achieved through a spectroscopic program that extended over five years .",
    "the primary source of photometry is hogg _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) ( henceforth h00 ) , who present four color catalogs for galaxies in the region of the hdf .",
    "they used the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and relied on it to extrapolate the measured magnitudes to a large aperture .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies were derived , parameterized in the rest frame , by cohen ( 2001 ) .",
    "those fits are adopted to calculate all luminosities used in this paper . sed parameters for 6 galaxies in the flanking fields with redshifts taken from from dawson _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) are given in appendix .",
    "at least for the hdf itself , the issue of possibly missing low surface brightness galaxies is moot in the redshift range under consideration here since the hst / wfpc2 imaging of williams _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) is extremely deep with respect to the limiting magnitude of the redshift survey ( see also driver 2001 ) .",
    "we assume that the h00 photometric catalog in the flanking fields is not seriously affected by the potential loss of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "our redshift catalog for the region of the hdf contains 735 objects of which 631 are galaxies with @xmath31 .",
    "ten galaxies ( all with @xmath32 ) are located just outside the 8 arcmin diameter sample boundary and are excluded .",
    "the two agns with @xmath33 are also excluded from the sample used for the lf analysis .",
    "we use the galaxy spectral classification scheme defined in cohen _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) , which basically characterizes the strength of the strongest emission lines , particularly [ oii ] at 3727  , [ oiii ] at 5007   and h@xmath3 , relative to the strong absorption features , h and k of caii and the normal absorption in the balmer lines . to review briefly , `` @xmath34 '' galaxies have spectra dominated by emission lines , `` @xmath35 '' galaxies have spectra dominated by absorption lines , while `` @xmath36 '' galaxies are of intermediate type .",
    "galaxies with broad emission lines are denoted as spectral class `` @xmath37 '' .",
    "starburst galaxies showing the higher balmer lines ( h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , etc . ) in emission are denoted by `` @xmath40 '' , but for such faint objects , it was not always possible to distinguish them from `` @xmath34 '' galaxies .",
    "these classifications were assigned for the galaxies our sample in the region of the hdf in c00 ( paper x ) ( see also cohen 2001 ) .",
    "while the galaxy spectral classes that we use are very broad , the possibility remains that galaxies may evolve between them over time .",
    "we must draw a distinction between evolution of the lf with redshift and evolution of a particular galaxy with time .",
    "the calculation of completeness for our redshift survey in the region of the hdf at observed @xmath17 is straightforward as the sample for our redshift survey was selected from the very deep @xmath17-band photometric catalog of h00 .",
    "we evaluate the completeness at @xmath17 by matching the redshift catalog and the @xmath17-band photometric catalog of h00 .",
    "this was done in c00 , but has to be reevaluated here as additional redshifts , primarily from cohen ( 2001 ) , further increase the completeness .",
    "we require not the cumulative completeness , but the completeness of the redshift survey per bin in @xmath17 mag , @xmath41 , which we determine in 0.25 mag bins .",
    "while the former is very high , the completeness per magnitude bin is falling fairly rapidly at the faintest bins .",
    "we cut off the sample for calculating the lf where the completeness in a 0.25 mag bin falls to @xmath1240% for the flanking fields , which occurs at @xmath17 = 23.5 and cut at @xmath42 for the hdf itself .",
    "of the 631 galaxies with @xmath43 , 12 in the hdf have @xmath44 , and 50 in the flanking fields have @xmath45 .",
    "this leaves a total sample of 553 galaxies .",
    "thus the sample actually analyzed here for the lf at rest - frame @xmath17 consists of 553 galaxies with @xmath0 , 93 of which are in the hdf and 460 are in the flanking fields .",
    "there are 21 galaxies in the hdf with @xmath46 , between the limits of the flanking fields cutoff in r and that of the hdf itself .",
    "the photometric catalog of h00 is not sufficiently deep at observed @xmath18 or @xmath16 .",
    "a study of the counts for the h00 catalog as a function of magnitude suggests that it becomes significantly incomplete at @xmath47 and at @xmath48 .",
    "hence there are many objects in the redshift catalog with no detection at @xmath18 in the h00 database .",
    "we therefore augment this primary photometric database by adding photometry at @xmath18 and @xmath16 for objects missing such from the unpublished catalog of barger , described in barger _",
    "_  ( 1998 )",
    ". if there is still no observation at @xmath18 , we assume @xmath49 , the median value for the sample at @xmath50 . if there is still no observation at @xmath16 , we use @xmath51 = 1.1 mag , again the median for the sample at @xmath50 , except for @xmath52 galaxies , where we assume @xmath51 = 5.0 mag .",
    "there are only 24 galaxies in the redshift sample with @xmath0 for which @xmath16 is missing , many of which are either close pairs or represent matching problems between the various catalogs .",
    "the completeness for the flanking fields is then calculated in the same way described above as was used for @xmath17 .    for the hdf itself , we augment the h00 photometric database with photometry from the hawaii group , then use the catalog of fernandez - soto _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) as the master list against which the completeness is evaluated for @xmath53 . for brighter magnitudes ,",
    "the h00 photometric catalogs as supplemented with the hawaii catalogs are used .",
    "the resulting values for the hdf and for the flanking fields are listed in table  [ table_complete ] .",
    "all objects in this field brighter than the the brightest entry in the table are galactic stars .",
    "the values used to calculate weights for the lf analysis are slightly smoothed from those given in the table .",
    "the observed @xmath18 completeness corrections were used for the rest frame @xmath18 analysis , the observed @xmath17 completeness corrections were used for the rest frame @xmath17 and @xmath16 analysis , while the observed @xmath16 completeness corrections were used for the analysis at rest frame 2400  .",
    "two weighting schemes are applied in the following luminosity function analysis .",
    "the first is the conventional weighting scheme used by many previous such analyses , @xmath54 = 1/@xmath41 , where @xmath55 denotes a sample galaxy with with redshift @xmath5 and observed @xmath17 mag .",
    "here the weight is a reflection of the completeness at a given magnitude of the redshift catalog .",
    "the general practice is to assign the missing galaxies ( i.e. the weight in excess of unity ) to the redshift of the observed galaxy .",
    "we refer to this scheme as the `` r - mag weights '' .",
    "similar weights have been calculated for @xmath18 and for @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , because of the difference in magnitude cutoff between the hdf and the flanking fields , we multiply the weight of those objects in the hdf with @xmath46 by the ratio of the solid angle subtended by the flanking fields to that of the hdf itself , which is 9.47 .",
    "these weights are valid if , and only if , the probability of determining a redshift is a function only of magnitude . however , in our sample the range of redshift is very large .",
    "the technical difficulties associated with the `` redshift desert '' , the regime @xmath56 , between where the standard optical emission lines shift out of the optical band and the strong uv lines and lyman limit move in , make redshift determinations in this @xmath5-regime extremely difficult . the weighting scheme used ideally should take this into account .",
    "hence we introduce a second set of weights which we call the high-@xmath5 weights .",
    "the number of objects that should be included in the sample based on their photometry but that are without redshifts is computed as before . however , _ all _",
    "the missing objects are put into the highest redshift bin .",
    "obviously use of the high-@xmath5 weights would be unacceptable in a sample with low completeness and with many bright ( and hence presumably `` nearby '' ) objects without redshifts , but with the present sample we view it as a only a moderate extrapolation from reality .",
    "we emphasize that the galaxy seds are specified in the rest frame ( see cohen 2001 ) and that all lfs are evaluated in the rest frame .",
    "we begin with rest frame @xmath17 , as the completeness corrections in the observed @xmath17 band are very accurately known to faint magnitudes due to the depth of the photometry catalog of h00 and the seds are very well defined there as well .",
    "note that @xmath57 ( rest frame ) @xmath58log[@xmath59(w ) ] = 36.97 .",
    "no extinction corrections for gas or dust within the galaxies themselves have been applied .",
    "we use a standard maximum likelihood technique to compute the luminosity functions ( sandage , tammann & yahil 1979 , efstathiou , ellis & peterson , 1988 , lin _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "we assume a schechter ( 1976 ) function adequately describes the lf at each @xmath5 for each set of galaxy spectral classes considered .",
    "the @xmath17 mag range is from 16 ( there is nothing brighter in this field except galactic stars ) to the faint end cutoff ( 24 in the hdf , 23.5 in the flanking fields ) . as a first reconnaissance of the problem",
    ", we break the sample into the same four redshift ranges over the regime from @xmath60 to 1.5 adopted in cohen ( 2001 ) .",
    "we add when feasible ( i.e. for the rest frame @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands ) the regime @xmath61 with some trepidation due to the selection of the hdf as a field devoid of bright galaxies ( williams _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) as well as the limited volume at low redshift of the narrow pencil beam probed here .",
    "table  [ table_zmean ] lists the mean redshift of each of the five bins as defined by the galaxies in the redshift sample as well as the co - moving volume of the bins .",
    "the mean redshift of the observed sample is biased high for the low redshift bins , where the increase in available volume is more rapid than the drop off due to increasing distance and decreasing apparent brightness .",
    "its biased somewhat low in the high redshift bins where the volume is increasing slowly while the apparent brightness is dropping steadily .",
    "the mean redshift of the bins is also slightly affected by the presence and exact redshifts of the most populous galaxy groups within some of the bins . in accordance with our philosophy of simplicity in the analysis described above",
    ", we ignore clustering .",
    "c00 have shown that while there are no clusters ( i.e. nothing comparable to an abell cluster ) in this sample , there are many populous groups of galaxies .",
    "we carry out a standard two parameter solution for the characteristic luminosity @xmath4 and for the faint end slope @xmath3 for the schechter function @xmath62 .",
    "we are thus assuming that within each of the bins , these two parameters can be taken as roughly constant .",
    "the details of the analysis are similar to that described by lin _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "we have five redshift bins and we use six groupings of galaxy spectral classes .",
    "the first three are the primary galaxy spectral classes , @xmath52 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( henceforth just denoted as @xmath65 ) .",
    "we also introduce two groupings of spectral classes to try to take into account the probable migration of galaxies between spectral classes due purely to technical difficulties , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as well as the class containing all galaxies ( excluding agn ) .",
    "we require a minimum sample of 15 galaxies in a bin .",
    "the @xmath63 galaxy sample in the bin @xmath68 is too small in the @xmath17-selected sample to be analyzed independently .",
    "this is probably not an indication of a decline in the number of such galaxies , but rather of a decline in our ability to discriminate between @xmath63 galaxies and @xmath65 galaxies with spectra of a fixed exposure time and hence limited signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the sample in the lowest redshift bin is very small , and can only be analyzed as a whole , as is also true of the highest redshift bin .",
    "there are several additional issues that affect the highest redshift bin .",
    "first , the spectral types there are not comparable in their meaning to those for galaxies with @xmath69",
    ". specifically galaxy spectral class @xmath52 in the @xmath69 sample refers to galaxies with strong ca ii h+k lines , obvious balmer line absorption and a strong 4000   break . at @xmath70 , however , this galaxy spectral class designates the presence of absorption features and breaks characteristic of the 2500   mid - uv .",
    "this is not an issue in the present work as the sample there is too small to subset in any way .    for the highest redshift bin , where the sample is dominated by galaxies with strong emission lines , the range of @xmath59 probed by our sample is small .",
    "hence the stability of the full solution is delicate . in the local universe ,",
    "samples of such galaxies show a very steep faint end slope .",
    "the solution for such a lf is much more difficult than for one with the more modest faint end slope seen in the local universe for @xmath52 galaxies .",
    "there the luminosity function has a well defined bend that can be used to separate @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a characteristic break is absent in local samples ( and , as we will see , the present high redshift samples as well ) of @xmath65 galaxies , making the separation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 much more difficult .",
    "if we consider the small sample in the highest redshift bin , the fluctuations introduced by a few extra galaxies in the hdf with @xmath71 are unacceptably large because the weight of each such galaxy in this grey zone is high ( @xmath72 ) . in a large sample , this can be tolerated , but in this bin with @xmath73 the total sample is very small , and the excess weight of the @xmath74% of the galaxies in the grey zone introduces an instability .",
    "the solution slides towards very high values of @xmath4 and very steep faint end slopes , even though no galaxies so luminous as the putative @xmath4 or anything near it actually exist in the sample . to overcome this",
    ", we found that the best way to proceed was , for the highest redshift bin only , to cut the sample back to limits of @xmath75 in the hdf as well as in the flanking fields , thus making the cutoff the same over the entire area of the survey .",
    "a similar restriction of the maximum allowed weight had to be imposed in all rest frame bands attempted for the highest redshift bin only .    in the case of the highest redshift bin , although there are 38 galaxies in our redshift catalog for the region of the hdf with @xmath73 , seven of them have @xmath76 and thus are excluded from the @xmath17-selected sample irrespective of location .",
    "six more are located in the flanking fields with @xmath77 and hence are eliminated .",
    "six more are in the hdf with @xmath71 , and also had to be eliminated from the @xmath17-selected sample .",
    "the results of this classical analysis are given in table  [ table2p]for the six galaxy spectral class groupings .",
    "the errors given in this table and in table  [ table2p_k ] are 1 @xmath78 uncertainties for one parameter . the error is measured by projecting along the relevant axis the full range of the two dimensional error contours .",
    "these , for a fixed number of objects , depend on the shape of the 2d uncertainty contours , which are shown figures 1 - 6 .",
    "the 90% confidence level contours are indicated in these figures calculated in accordance with  14.5 of press _ et al . _  ( 1986 ) for each of the galaxy spectral groupings for the three bins between @xmath60 and 1.05 .",
    "efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( 1988 ) evaluated the expected variance of @xmath3 and @xmath4 analytically as a function of sample size and verified their predictions with monte carlo calculations . using their formulae ,",
    "we expect @xmath79 = 0.25 for a sample of 100 galaxies .",
    "our measured errors are in reasonable agreement with their formulae .",
    "figures  [ figure_rlf_on_data_ie ] and [ figure_rlf_on_data_a ] show the resulting lf for two galaxy spectral groupings ( @xmath66 and @xmath65 ) for the redshift bin @xmath80 .",
    "the best fit lf from table  [ table_fixa ] is also shown superposed on the data .",
    "the lower panels in each of these figures shows the errors in the lf due to poisson statistics as a function of luminosity for these two cases .",
    "the number of galaxies per step in log(@xmath81 ) is largest in the region just below @xmath4 .",
    "brighter than that , the factor of @xmath82 rapidly cuts the observed galaxy numbers in a small sample such as ours to zero , while within a fixed redshift interval the faint end magnitude cutoff of the redshift survey truncates the faint end of the luminosity distribution of the observed galaxies . when there is only one galaxy in a bin , @xmath83 becomes unity .",
    "because of the substantial mean redshift of the sample , the calculations for the lf parameters at rest frame @xmath16 are made using the observed @xmath17-selected sample and use the observed @xmath17 weights , as do those at rest frame @xmath17 .",
    "hence they are quite similar to those for rest frame @xmath17 described above .",
    "the same treatment of the highest redshift bin was required , eliminating all galaxies with @xmath84 in the hdf .",
    "the lf parameters for rest frame @xmath16 are given in tables  [ table2p_u ] and [ table_fixa_u ] , as well as interspersed in subsequent tables .",
    "the calculations at rest frame @xmath18 used the observed @xmath18-selected sample and the observed @xmath18 weights .",
    "the number of galaxies in a redshift bin used to determine the lf at rest frame @xmath18 depends on the faint end cutoffs adopted for observed @xmath18 and on the color of each galaxy , and hence often will not be exactly the same as used for the @xmath17-selected lf , but should be fairly close",
    ". some of the bluer and fainter among the @xmath65 galaxies which are members of the @xmath17-selected sample may be too faint to be included in the @xmath18-selected sample .",
    "also , since the the observations for the redshift catalog were defined by a observed @xmath17 photometric catalog , there will be a more gradual decline in completeness near the survey limit at any other observed band due to the range of colors of galaxies .    for the lf at rest frame @xmath18",
    ", we proceed as with the @xmath17-selected sample .",
    "we adopt a faint end cutoff for observed @xmath18 of 20.75 in the flanking fields and 21.25 in the hdf . to obtain convergence in the highest redshift bin",
    ", we had to establish a maximum weight of 15 , thus eliminating a small number of galaxies .",
    "with this modification , the highest @xmath5 bin converged well with a total of 27 galaxies included with @xmath73 .",
    "the results of the computation of @xmath3 and @xmath85 at rest frame @xmath18 are given in tables  [ table2p_k ] and [ table_fixa_k ] .",
    "to guide our expectations , we note that based on the mean galaxy sed parameters as a function of galaxy spectral type given in table  3 of cohen ( 2001 ) , we might expect that @xmath86 will be larger for @xmath52 galaxies than for @xmath65 galaxies by about 0.2 dex .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the results of the calculations .",
    "also , as expected , since the absorption line galaxies are the reddest galaxies in the sample , their the fractional contribution to the total luminosity density is slightly larger at rest frame @xmath18 than it is at @xmath17 .",
    "there is excellent agreement in the mean value @xmath3 we derive for each galaxy spectral grouping between the rest frame @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 calculations .",
    "the evolutionary rates over the interval @xmath87 ( given in table  [ table_q ] ) are very similar for rest frame @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "lf parameters were also calculated at 2400   in the rest frame for galaxies with @xmath88 where that regime shifts into the ground based optical bandpass .",
    "observed @xmath16 is used to define the sample , with cutoffs of @xmath89 in the flanking fields and 24.75 in the hdf . here the sed model is being stretched to the extreme blue limit of its wavelength range of validity .",
    "the results of the computation of @xmath3 and @xmath90 are given in tables  [ table2p_q ] and [ table_fixa_q ] .",
    "the @xmath52 galaxies are very faint at observed @xmath16 ; many have @xmath91 , well below the sample cutoff .",
    "they drop out of the sample , leaving fewer @xmath52 galaxies in many redshift bins than the minimum adopted for a lf solution",
    ". however , these contribute very little to the total light at 2400  in the rest frame , and hence a negligible error is introduced into the calculation of the total luminosity density there .",
    "only the regime @xmath92 converged well and could be used to define the mean values for @xmath3 given in table  [ table_meana ] .    at 2400 ,",
    "the faint end slope , even for @xmath65 galaxies , may be less steep than at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , the larger sed errors at this rest frame wavelength may somehow have affected the analysis to produce this apparent flattening of the lf .",
    "as expected ( see figures  1 - 6 ) , the strong negative covariance between @xmath4 and @xmath3 seen in the analyses of local samples is also found here .",
    "this complicates the issue of comparing the resulting parameters among the various redshift bins and galaxy spectral groupings .",
    "irrespective of this issue , our analysis thus far has demonstrated ( see tables  [ table2p ] , [ table_meana ] , [ table2p_u ] and [ table2p_k ] ) that the faint end slope of the lfs in the redshift regime studied here shows the same general dependence on galaxy spectral type / morphological type found in numerous studies of the local lf reviewed in  [ compare_alpha ] .",
    "specifically , the faint end slope is much steeper for late type spirals ( strong emission line galaxies in the galaxy spectral classification scheme used here ) than it is for galaxies without detectable emission lines . , where the determination of @xmath3 is quite uncertain .",
    "the solution for rest frame 2400  is also problematic . ]",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ figure_alpha_comp ] , to be discussed in more detail in ",
    "[ compare_alpha ] .    furthermore , @xmath3 appears to be constant , to within the uncertainties due to random fluctuations given the number of galaxies in each bin , for each galaxy spectral class group over the redshift regime considered here .",
    "in the next set of fits , we continue to use the standard two parameter schechter function model with no additional parameters . to proceed , we need to make an additional simplifying assumption .",
    "we assume , based on the results presented above , that @xmath3 is in fact constant with redshift , and that the variations in @xmath3 within a given galaxy spectral grouping seen within tables  [ table2p ] , [ table2p_u ] , [ table2p_k ] and [ table2p_q ] are not real . an alternative approach , assuming that @xmath4 is constant with redshift while @xmath3 is allowed to vary , is explored in an appendix .",
    "we adopt a constant value of @xmath3 for each galaxy spectral grouping independent of redshift .",
    "these values for each galaxy spectral grouping , which are from the values of @xmath3 found for each redshift bin given tables  [ table2p ] , [ table2p_u ] , [ table2p_k ] and [ table2p_q ] with @xmath87 weighted by the number of galaxies in each sample , are given in table  [ table_meana ] .",
    "the specific places where this assumption is most likely not to be valid include the emission line galaxies in the two higher redshift bins , where the galaxy spectral types becomes less distinguishable due to the lower quality of the spectra of such faint objects .",
    "many galaxies in that redshift regime which might at lower redshift be considered to be of intermediate galaxy spectral type tend to get classified as @xmath65 galaxies .",
    "the composite types @xmath66 and @xmath67 were introduced precisely to explore this issue , and indeed @xmath3 for the second of these is closer to constant than it is for the @xmath65 galaxies considered alone .",
    "also the composite nature of the set consisting of all galaxies may , at higher redshift , become more dominated by the galaxies with strong emission lines , with their concomitant steeper faint end slope .",
    "this would tend to produce a small decrease in @xmath3 for this group with increasing @xmath5 , as may be seen in table  [ table2p ] , although the possible effect is not larger than the errors .",
    "we use the contours of constant @xmath93 for the two parameter solution of  [ 2pmodel ] above ( see figures [ figure_errors_a]-[figure_errors_all ] ) to reevaluate @xmath4 , finding the value with the maximum likelihood for the appropriate fixed value of @xmath3 from table  [ table_meana ] .",
    "this must be done for each galaxy spectral grouping at each rest frame wavelength and for each bin in redshift .",
    "the results are given in table  [ table_fixa ] , which is an updated version of table  [ table2p ]  assuming a fixed value of @xmath3 holds for each galaxy grouping , for rest frame @xmath17 , and tables  [ table_fixa_u ] , [ table_fixa_k ] , and [ table_fixa_q ] for the remaining rest frame bands analyzed here .",
    "from the entries in table  [ table_fixa ] combined with the median redshift for each bin given in table  [ table_zmean ] , we can estimate directly the change in @xmath94 with redshift .",
    "similar calculations can be carried out for each of the rest frame colors .",

    "to accomplish this , taking rest frame @xmath17 as an example , first we fix @xmath3 to the mean value given above for each galaxy spectral grouping in table  [ table_meana ] .",

    "in this solution , we have assumed a simple parametric form for the evolution of @xmath4 with redshift and also assumed a value for @xmath4 at some particular redshift , as well as continued our assumption of a fixed value for @xmath3 .",
    "this is the price for avoiding the use of individual redshift bins , each with their small samples and large uncertainties , used in the previous section (   [ 2pmodel ] ) to derive the evolution of @xmath4 in a piecewise fashion .",
    "if we were sure we could match our photometry and galaxy spectral groups onto those of local samples , the much larger local samples could be used to provide the benchmark luminosity @xmath100 . however , this is not the case , and we must use one of our own redshift bins as the benchmark .",

    "they suggest that while the overall trends of the evolution of @xmath94 with redshift can be discerned through analysis of our limited dataset , a much larger sample of galaxies will be needed to determine this to an accuracy of 10% .    to verify the above results , we have carried out a solution allowing all three parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 , to vary for each of the three rest frame bands @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we do this only for the most populous galaxy spectral groupings , @xmath67 and `` all '' , and obtain the results labeled `` ( 3p ) '' in table  [ table_q ] , which are in agreement to within the uncertainties with the values given in the same table for the somewhat more constrained solution procedure described above .",

    "our 1@xmath78 uncertainty in @xmath3 is @xmath101 . testing rest frame @xmath17 as an example",
    ", we find that adoption of a value for @xmath3 that is 0.15 too large will result in an underestimate of @xmath94 by 0.35 dex for @xmath65 galaxies , but only by 0.05 dex for @xmath52 galaxies .",
    "this striking difference arising because of the differing shapes of the error contours .",

    "the galaxy spectral groups @xmath52 , @xmath63 , @xmath66 and @xmath65 all show substantial brightening with redshift over the range from 0.24 to 2.2@xmath1 . the composite group @xmath67 and the group consisting of all galaxies show a slower increase in luminosity with redshift except at 2400  .",
    "the rise in @xmath4 found here for the galaxy spectral groupings with flatter faint end slopes is believed to be real .",
    "however , we suggest that the large apparent brightening seen for the @xmath65 spectral group is spurious , and is due to mixing of @xmath63 with @xmath65 galaxies in the higher redshift bins where these two galaxy classes become essentially indistinguishable",

    "we thus view the subdivision of the sample into galaxy spectral groupings whose results are most likely to be valid as the @xmath52 with the @xmath67 groups .",
    "those , as well as the group containing all the galaxies , will be the groups emphasized in the remainder of this work .",
    "the final step in this analysis is to compute the normalization constant for the lf .",
    "the calculations are carried out with @xmath3 fixed at the mean value adopted for each galaxy spectral grouping ( given in table  [ table_meana ] ) and the resulting luminosities from tables  [ table_fixa ] . for rest frame",
    "@xmath17 only , we give 1@xmath78 errors as a multiplier to be applied to @xmath102 .",
    "these were calculated utilizing the @xmath103 error contours of the two parameter lf solutions .",
    "we take the @xmath4 and @xmath3 from these contours at the ends of the major and minor axes of the error contour .",
    "we then propagate these values through the codes to calculate four values of @xmath102 .",
    "we take the average of the absolute values of the fractional deviations with respect to the nominal value as the @xmath103 error .",
    "this is an approximation for the true @xmath78 , but should be close enough for our purposes , given our small sample size .",
    "it is important to stress that the errors given in table  [ table_fixa ] include variations in @xmath4 and in @xmath3 , as well as the term arising from poisson statistics . although the numbers of galaxies in some of the bins are quite small , the contribution to the total error of this last term is generally small .",
    "these errors have _ not _ been calculated assuming fixed values of @xmath3 , but represent the full range of likelihood with both parameters allowed to vary .    to understand the behavior of the uncertainty for @xmath102 shown in table  [ table_fixa ] , consider an idealized sample of galaxies which is complete and which reaches as faint as @xmath104 , where @xmath1050.1@xmath4 .",
    "the error in @xmath102 will depend on @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath3 large and positive , the lf approaches a @xmath39-function .",
    "as long as the @xmath39-function is located at @xmath106 , the error in @xmath102 will be zero .",
    "however , for the steep faint end slopes found for the lfs of @xmath65 galaxies , the integral of the lf will change significantly for a small change in @xmath3 , and hence the uncertainty in @xmath102 will be large .",
    "for a very deep sample where @xmath107 , a situation not achieved in the present sample , the changes in the the integral are small as @xmath3 is varied even for steep faint end slopes . for a fixed @xmath3 and @xmath104 , as @xmath4 increases",
    ", @xmath102 decreases , and again the change in the integral is larger for lfs with steeper faint end slopes .",

    ", we assume that at any rest frame wavelength and for a particular galaxy spectral grouping , galaxy lfs change with redshift only through variations of @xmath4 . with this assumption , @xmath108 .",
    "we can then directly compare the number densities as a function of redshift within the entries for a particular galaxy spectral grouping ( i.e. a particular choice of @xmath3 ) simply by comparing the derived values of @xmath102 .",
    "we find that the co - moving number density of @xmath52 galaxies is constant between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , but then declines by 40% at a mean @xmath111 .",
    "we have calculated using our sed formalism the redshift at which a normal @xmath52 galaxy with a typical sed from cohen ( 2001 ) becomes fainter than the cutoff in the flanking field for a @xmath4 galaxy . at observed @xmath17 ,",
    "this is @xmath112 and at observed @xmath18 this is @xmath113 .",
    "thus it is only to be expected that almost all of the absorption line galaxies will be fainter than than the faint end cutoff adopted at observed @xmath17 for @xmath114 , and this produces a drastic drop in the number of @xmath52 galaxies in the sample .",
    "we emphasize that this happens for the nominal sed of an absorption line galaxy .",
    "one way of checking that the co - moving number density of @xmath52 galaxies is actually constant , at least out to @xmath2 , is to calculate the luminosity density from such galaxies in each redshift bin , but including only such galaxies more luminous than @xmath115 .",
    "comparison of luminosity densities is much more robust than comparison of individual lf parameters such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "we do this by directly summing the @xmath59 for the @xmath52 observed galaxies in the sample ( no weighting is applied ) , adopting @xmath116 .",
    "this yields values of 0.57 , 1.16 and @xmath117 w mpc@xmath118 for the redshift bins @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "the selection criteria adopted for the hdf itself ( `` no bright galaxies '' ) probably produces the low value in the lowest redshift bin .",
    "the values for the two higher redshift bins agree to within 25% .",
    "since luminous @xmath52 galaxies are highly clustered , clustering could easily account for this difference .",
    "daddi , cimitti , & renzini ( 2000 ) have evaluated the surface density of eros with colors corresponding to passively evolving elliptical galaxies in the latest large area deep infrared imaging surveys ( both their own and those of thompson _ et al . _  1999",
    ") and conclude that there is good agreement in all respects between the properties of the eros and those predicted for ellipticals at @xmath121 .    the co - moving density of galaxies with emission lines does not change by more than 20% out to @xmath2 based on the @xmath67 and @xmath65 galaxy spectral groupings .",
    "the co - moving number density of the entire sample of galaxies is dominated by the @xmath65 galaxies .",
    "the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath122 ) is low by a factor of @xmath122 , which is not surprising considering the deliberate choice of the hdf as a region devoid of bright ( i.e. nearby ) galaxies .",
    "ignoring that bin , the volume density is constant to within the uncertainties until the highest redshift bin , @xmath73 , at which point it falls drastically , by a factor of @xmath1210 .",
    "this is in agreement with figure  6 of c00 , a plot of observed @xmath17 mag versus @xmath5 for the galaxies in this sample , which gives the strong visual impression that there is a deficit of galaxies at @xmath121 .",
    "the situation at the highest redshift bin is difficult to evaluate .",
    "there is a litany of problems here , ranging from not seeing very deep in the lf to having to extrapolate rest frame @xmath17 when it corresponds to an observed wavelength of 2600 , thus requiring trust in the sed model perhaps beyond that warranted .",
    "it must also be recalled that the grouping of all galaxies is a sum of galaxies of several different spectral groups whose relative contributions change as a function of redshift .",
    "it is thus the most likely galaxy spectral grouping of those we use here to violate the assumptions made here about how galaxy lfs evolve with redshift , specifically that @xmath3 remains constant and that lfs change only through variation of @xmath4 .",
    "we can estimate the number of objects that are missing redshifts in the @xmath17-selected sample .",
    "overall our redshift survey is @xmath1293% complete to the stated limits ( @xmath42 in the hdf , @xmath123 in the flanking fields ) .",
    "there are are about 735 objects with redshifts in the region of the hdf , including galactic stars , but we need the number that fall within these photometric limits . if ignore the very small number of higher-@xmath5 objects within these photometric limits , we deduce that there are about 50 objects missing from the redshift survey . in this weighting scheme ,",
    "those objects are all put into the highest redshift ( @xmath124 ) bin , rather than into any of the lower @xmath5 bins .    for each additional restframe bandpass",

    "we calculate the part of @xmath125 due to objects which are within the photometric limits of the survey but which do not have spectroscopic redshifts ( the `` missing '' galaxies ) . this calculation carried out at rest frame @xmath18 suggests that the number of galaxies in the highest redshift bin , which is 27 in this case , must be increased by @xmath12100 .",
    "the highest redshift bin is very sparsely populated . due to the completeness limits adopted ,",
    "the @xmath17-selected sample in this redshift bin contains only 24 objects of the 38 galaxies with @xmath73 in the redshift catalog .",

    "six of these 24 galaxies are in the hdf with @xmath126 , and hence have @xmath127 .",
    "these were excluded from the rest frame @xmath17 analysis , but not from the rest frame @xmath18 analysis .",
    "thus the impact of adopting the high-@xmath5 weighting scheme is dramatic in the highest redshift bin , increasing the number of objects by factors of @xmath124 .",
    "this will provide the maximum possible correction factor to @xmath102 for the highest redshift bin . since the redshift survey is very complete",
    ", the impact on the lower @xmath5 bins of adopting this weighting scheme is small .",
    "less than 15% of the total weight in the redshift bins up to @xmath2 in the @xmath17-selected sample comes from objects that are not observed",
    ". the number of objects in all lower redshift bins should be decreased at the same time by @xmath1220% for the @xmath68 bin and by 8% for the @xmath128 redshift bin for the @xmath17-selected sample , with slightly higher values prevailing for the @xmath18 selected sample .      at first glance , as shown in ",
    "[ impact ] , the redshift regime @xmath73 has a co - moving number density of galaxies drastically smaller ( by a factor of 10 or more ) than that of the lower redshift bins . our approach is to make our best effort estimate of the correction factors that can be applied , leaning towards trying to achieve a maximum co - moving number density , and to see if these correction factors can realistically be made large enough to achieve constant co - moving number density .",
    "the biggest correction factor will come from adopting the high-@xmath5 weighting scheme discussed above for the galaxies missing spectroscopic redshifts but within the adopted limits for the photometric survey .",
    "we adopt the values given in the previous section , i.e. the @xmath17 sample then has @xmath12100 galaxies in the highest redshift bin , the @xmath18 sample @xmath12125 galaxies .",
    "note that this is a firm upper limit to the correction .",
    "we can easily be missing another 10% of the galaxies through problems in the photometry at these faint levels , overlapping images which have not been properly resolved , etc .",
    "note that this is 10% of _ all _ galaxies in the sample , or perhaps more appropriately 10% of all faint galaxies in the sample , _ not _ 10% of the galaxies in the highest redshift bin .",
    "just as for the galaxies missing redshifts , we apply this correction assuming all these galaxies ( 55 galaxies ) are at high redshift and to be added to the highest redshift bin only .",
    "this factor could be underestimated slightly , so since we are going for the maximum believable correction , we apply a 15% correction , which is equivalent to adding 80 galaxies , to the highest redshift bin .",
    "( it is here that a sample defined exclusively through hst imaging , with much better characteristic spatial resolution , would be superior .",
    "we have repeatedly requested hst imaging of the hdf flanking fields . )",
    "we must than add in all the @xmath52 galaxies which are mostly , at this high redshift , fainter than the photometric cutoffs adopted .",
    "absorption line galaxies constitute roughly 1/6 of the total @xmath17-selected sample in the lower redshift bins , and we assume this should apply in the highest redshift bin as well .",
    "this makes the membership of the highest redshift bin be @xmath12200 galaxies and brings the co - moving number density in the bin @xmath73 to within 30% of the number density for lower redshifts .",
    "we regard this as close enough , given the errors .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath20 , @xmath17 in the observed frame corresponds to a wavelength of 2600 , which is at the limit of validity at the blue end of our seds .",
    "( see cohen 2001 for a more detailed discussion of the limitations of our sed model . )",
    "the errors for @xmath129 are larger than those of other bands considered here because of the uncertainty of the sed model there .",
    "this combination of factors does just barely succeed in raising the population of the highest redshift bin @xmath73 to the point where it is consistent with constant number density of galaxies throughout the sample volume .",
    "we emphasize that we have pushed each factor to its maximum to accomplish this .",
    "we have perhaps pressed these factors beyond the tolerance of the referee , to which the author can only reply that after looking at the images and the spectra and checking object by object over the course of the past few years , she believes such large correction factors can not be ruled out .",
    "it is not possible for the co - moving galaxy number density at luminosities near @xmath4 to have been significantly higher at @xmath130 than it is at present .    to summarize the conclusion of this discussion , assuming that no large error has been introduced by fixing @xmath3 for the highest redshift bin , the apparent deficit of luminous galaxies with @xmath121 in our earlier papers is probably @xmath131 real , but this requires stretching the correction factors for various sample selection issues to their maximum credible values",
    "this result needs to be verified with a deeper and much larger redshift sample accompanied by a photometric catalog based on better spatial resolution images than those available to us .      as a check on the validity of our lf modeling",

    "similar calculations are done for the rest frame @xmath18 sample selected at observed @xmath18 with a cutoff of 20.75 , and the 2400  sample selected at observed @xmath16 with a cutoff of 24.0 .",

    "because of the strong negative covariance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , any estimate of the uv luminosity density based solely on values of @xmath4 which ignores completely the role of @xmath3 must be viewed with suspicion .",
    "hence we prefer the estimate for the change of the uv luminosity density with redshift based on the appropriate integrations for @xmath140 $ ] described above , whose results are given in table  [ table_lumdens ] and in figure  [ figure_lum_dens ] .",
    "these suggest that @xmath140 $ ] increases by a factor of @xmath124 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , given the current controversy over this issue and its overall importance , we are planning to redo the measurement of the 3727  line strengths shortly as this should provide a more definitive value for the star formation rate and one potentially less affected by extinction than a value based on the uv luminosity density .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the spectra suggests that that the mean rest frame equivalent width of the 3727  emission line of [ oii ] for our observed sample of galaxies in the region of the hdf remains approximately constant with redshift , which requires the mean observed equivalent width to increase @xmath141 . under these circumstances ,",
    "the emitted flux in this emission line will increase substantially with redshift due to the substantial rise in mean luminosity of the observed sample given in table  [ table_lmean ] .",
    "this issue will be discussed at length in the next paper in this series .",
    "once a model for the evolution of the integrated light for a galaxy is adopted , a number of other calculations become feasible .",
    "we can , for example , extrapolate the luminosity densities in each redshift bin given in table  [ table_lumdens ] into luminosity densities at @xmath13 , taking out the expected trends due to normal stellar evolution .",
    "this is straightforward for galaxies with little star formation . for galaxies with considerable star formation during the time ( redshift ) interval in question , assumptions regarding the form of the the sfr as a function of @xmath5",
    "become more critical .",
    "we adopt the galaxy evolution models of poggianti ( 1997 ) for this purpose .",
    "in particular , her elliptical model has an initial burst of star formation with an exponential decay timescale of 1.0 gyr and is 15 gyr old .",
    "her model for sc galaxies assumes a star formation rate proportional to the gas fraction and includes inflow .",
    "quiescent galaxies within which significant star formation has not occurred during the entire redshift range spanned here will basically be fading in luminosity strictly through stellar evolution .",
    "the detailed behavior of the fading as a function of redshift and rest frame wavelength depends only on the adopted stellar evolutionary tracks and on the conversion between time and redshift ( the cosmology ) .",
    "they are seen as @xmath52 galaxies throughout the sample volume . in actively star forming galaxies , on the other hand ,",
    "the fading with time from passive stellar evolution , although always occurring , can be overcome by the additional luminosity input from young stars .",
    "figure  [ figure_lstar_urk_z ] compares the luminosity evolution we find for the region of the hdf given in table  [ table_q ] ( filled circles ) with those predicted from the model .",
    "the mean redshifts of the three bins between @xmath60 and 1.05 are used , and the points represent @xmath4 for rest frame @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath52 and @xmath67 ( i.e. relatively quiescent and star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "these points are connected by the solid lines .",
    "the three parameter solution for @xmath9 is used . because here we are focusing on @xmath4 only",
    ", the luminosities in each of the rest frame bands have been shifted to the value of @xmath3 obtained for rest frame @xmath17 for each galaxy spectral grouping .",
    "this requires adding a small constant offset to the result for to log(l * ) in each redshift bin .",
    "the constant is different for each galaxy spectral grouping and also varies with rest frame wavelength .",
    "( it is 0 at rest frame @xmath17 . )",
    "the predictions of poggianti s models in this figure are represented by the open circles , which for each rest frame color are connected by dashed lines .    the agreement between the evolution in @xmath4 with redshift as a function of rest frame color that we derive through our analysis of the lf for galaxies in the region of the hdf with that predicted by poggianti s ( 1997 ) galaxy synthetic spectral evolution models for the sc model with the star forming galaxies in our sample is reasonable at all rest frame wavelengths .",
    "the agreement for the more quiescent galaxies is fair at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but poor at rest frame @xmath16 .",
    "the passively evolving model predicts a fading at rest frame @xmath16 with increasing time that is significantly larger than that inferred by our analysis .",
    "the predicted fading of @xmath120.9 dex in log[@xmath142 between @xmath143 and 0.6 is not present in the data .",
    "one can not argue that these galaxies at @xmath144 are masquerading as galaxies of any other spectral group as they remain very red in the rest frame optical / near - ir .",
    "such red galaxies very rarely , if ever , show emission lines throughout the relevant redshift range ( see cohen 2001 ) , and hence have little or no current star formation until beyond @xmath20 .",
    "they therefore can not have morphed out of the @xmath52 galaxy group .",
    "it is undoubtedly true that an adjustment to the star formation prescription used by poggianti to generate the sed of the quiescent galaxies could resolve these problems .",
    "the general form required is for a small tail of residual star formation to continue with time beyond the initial burst .    at our request ,",
    "poggianti ( private communication , 2001 ) has recalculated the evolutionary corrections for the @xmath52 galaxies using our cosmology and also changing the e - folding time of the initial burst from 1 gyr to 0.5 gyr .",
    "the values published in poggianti ( 1997 ) are recovered with the appropriate inputs .",
    "however , the new evolutionary corrections at rest frame @xmath16 are much smaller at high @xmath5 than those published in poggianti ( 1997 ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath14 , the new evolutionary correction is @xmath122.5 mag smaller .",
    "these new evolutionary corrections provide a much better fit to our results .",
    "figure  [ figure_lstar_urk_z ] recovers one of the key results of cohen ( 2001 ) , that the major change in galaxy seds with increasing redshift in this redshift range is the rest frame uv becoming bluer for actively star forming galaxies .",
    "here we add an evaluation of the trend of overall luminosity .",
    "one rationale for studying galaxies at @xmath18 is that the integrated light there is much more representative of the total stellar mass of a galaxy than are the optical colors , where light from the most recent epoch of star formation involving only a small fraction of the stellar mass in the galaxy may dominate over that from the much more massive older population as one moves towards the ultraviolet . to convert the rest frame @xmath18 luminosity density we measure as a function of redshift ( given in table  [ table_lumdens ] ) into total stellar masses of the galaxies requires a model of evolving galaxy spectral energy distributions to evaluate their mass - to - light ratio as a function of look back time and of their star formation history .",
    "because the evolutionary corrections at @xmath18 are small and almost independent of spectral type over the range of stars that contribute substantially to the integrated light of a galaxy at this rest frame wavelength , we are able accomplish this transformation with some degree of precision , and hence to deduce the total stellar mass in galaxies as a function of redshift . any variation in the total stellar mass",
    "must be a result of star formation .",
    "we use the models of poggianti ( 1997 ) for the evolution of galaxy integrated light to extrapolate the luminosity densities at rest frame @xmath18 , @xmath145 at @xmath146 , given in table  [ table_lumdens ] to values at @xmath147 , @xmath148 , so that they can be directly compared .",
    "this quantity is then converted into total stellar mass in galaxies assuming a constant mass to light ratio at rest frame @xmath18 applies to all galaxies at @xmath147 ; we adopt 0.8 ( in solar units ) .",
    "the results are given in table  [ table_ml ] .",
    "the entries in the table are given in the form of @xmath149 extrapolated back to @xmath13 in units of w mpc@xmath118 .",
    "the conversion factors required to obtain values in units of @xmath150mpc@xmath118 or @xmath151mpc@xmath118 are given in the notes to the table .",
    "the uncertainties have been propagated using the values from table  [ table_lumdens ] for @xmath18 and assuming a 15% uncertainty in the evolutionary correction that brings the observed @xmath149 back to @xmath13 .",
    "if the contribution of the different galaxy spectral groupings to the integrated light at @xmath18 were constant with @xmath5 , the @xmath152 adopted would act strictly as a normalization factor .",
    "hence we ignore its uncertainty in this calculation .",
    "there is no sign in table  [ table_ml ] of any substantial increase in the total mass in stars between @xmath60 and @xmath2 .",
    "the total stellar mass in galaxies appears to be constant with redshift to within @xmath153% .",
    "this statement is not inconsistent with the claim made above in  [ text_lumdens ] that the uv luminosity density at 2400 and hence the star formation rate are increasing substantially between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if we adopt the conversion between uv flux and star formation rate given by kennicutt ( 1998 ) and integrate the uv luminosity density @xmath154 as a function of time between the present and @xmath2 , we find that @xmath15520% of the total stellar mass currently in galaxies given table  [ table_ml ] has been formed since @xmath2 , depending on the exact choice of @xmath9 for rest frame 2400  and on the mean extinction adopted .",
    "since the key parameters are proportional to @xmath156 ( @xmath157 for @xmath81 , @xmath158 for the co - moving number density , and @xmath159 for the co - moving luminosity density ) , the consequences of changes in @xmath160 are easily evaluated .",
    "the effect of the choice of @xmath161 and @xmath162 is more subtle , as both the luminosity distance ( @xmath163 ) , and the cosmological co - moving volume , which affects co - moving densities , are non - linear in these parameters .",
    "we compare the result of adopting the flat model @xmath164 and @xmath165 suggested by the cmd fluctuation measurements ( de bernardis _ et al._= 2001 ) instead of the model adopted in this series of papers , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , which has the virtue that many cosmological quantities of interest have analytical solutions .",
    "the luminosity distance for the flat model is @xmath128% larger than it is for the model we use , which difference can be removed by modifying the adopted value of @xmath160 from 60 to 65 km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22 .",
    "more importantly , the ratio of luminosity distances between the two models changes as a function of @xmath5 by only about 10% over the range @xmath60 to 1.5 , with the flat model having luminosity distances that increase more rapidly with redshift .",
    "adoption of such a model would mean that the more distant galaxies in our sample would become slightly brighter by @xmath120.07 dex in log(@xmath81 ) compared to the nearest galaxies .",
    "these small changes are well within our errors . given the contribution from passive stellar evolution within galaxies , which is larger than this cosmological difference , there is no hope of using our sample to learn anything about cosmology .    in the flat model with @xmath166 ,",
    "the differential co - moving volume between redshift @xmath5 and @xmath168 , @xmath169 , is larger for the flat model than for the cosmological model we use here .",
    "moreover , @xmath169 for the flat model increases even more rapidly at high redshift than does @xmath169 for the cosmology adopted here .",
    "[ @xmath170 for @xmath171/ [ @xmath170 for @xmath172 = 1.23 for @xmath173 .",
    "this difference exacerbates the problems of the low co - moving density we have inferred in our analysis for @xmath174 in  [ number ] .",
    "a larger survey with better understanding of the sample completeness for @xmath121 might be sensitive to this difference in co - moving volume .",
    "in comparing our characteristic luminosities with those of other surveys , we convert the cosmology to that adopted here .. ] we also report two values of @xmath4 .",
    "the first is that obtained from the maximum likelihood solution with fixed @xmath3 given in the appropriate one of tables  [ table_fixa ] , [ table_fixa_u ] , [ table_fixa_k ] or [ table_fixa_q ] for the @xmath175 bin .",
    "this value is then extrapolated to @xmath147 ( for comparison with local surveys ) using the values for @xmath9 from table  [ table_q ] . since all local redshift surveys have much larger galaxy samples than we do , we assume their determinations of the faint end slope of the lf are correct .",
    "therefore , a second comparison value is obtained from our tables by finding @xmath4 at the value of @xmath3 of the local survey , which may not be the same as our best value of @xmath3 of table  [ table_meana ] . because of the covariance between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , this second value of @xmath4 is perhaps the most valid for the comparison .",
    "values of @xmath3 are directly comparable ; no adjustments are required .",
    "local surveys determine the lf over a much wider range of luminosity than is possible when very distant galaxies are involved .",
    "their luminosity density integrals are carried out to fainter lower limits in @xmath59 , and their total luminosity densities are correspondingly higher . to overcome this",

    "the high redshift galaxies have been attempted with lris at keck by vogt _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 , 1997 ) , who have succeeded in measuring optical rotation curves for a small sample of @xmath232 galaxies with emission in the [ oii ] line at 3727 .",
    "they find only a small offset of @xmath2330.4 mag in rest - frame @xmath195 with respect to the local relation , which they ascribe to luminosity evolution in the field galaxy sample .",
    "this value is consistent with the modest values of @xmath9 found for star forming galaxies in the present analysis .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to study the lf in the hdf using photometric redshifts , including the work of sawicki , lin & yee ( 1997 ) , connolly _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) , and pascarelle , lanzetta & fernandez - soto ( 1998 ) , as well as the nicmos based studies of thompson , weymann & storrie - lombardi ( 2001 ) and dickinson ( 2000 ) .",
    "the area on the sky of the hdf is very small , and hence only a broad brush picture can thus be derived without insurmountable problems of small number statistics .",
    "since the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath42 is very small ( @xmath234 ) and essentially all of them have spectroscopic redshifts now , such efforts are most valuable as a means of exploring the regime beyond @xmath235 , where our sample is small , as well as the redshift `` desert '' between @xmath236 ( once suitable calibration of the photometric redshifts exists there ) .",
    "this study of the lf of galaxies in the region of the hdf - north relies on the large databases built up in earlier papers in this series .",
    "it has been made feasible by the joining of the very complete redshift survey in that region of c00 , the photometric catalogs of h00 , and the rest - frame sed analysis of cohen ( 2001 ) .",
    "we divide the sample into six galaxy spectral class groupings , not all of which are independent , and five redshift bins .",
    "we use this data to carry out a classical lf analysis assuming the schechter function with fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 is an adequate description within each redshift bin and for each galaxy spectral class grouping .",
    "we evaluate the lf at rest frame 2400 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we find that the behavior of the faint end slope is consistent with that observed in the local universe .",
    "the lfs for quiescent galaxies have shallow faint end slopes , while those of galaxies with detectable emission lines have steeper faint end slopes .",
    "furthermore , as shown in table  [ table_meana ] these slopes are independent of redshift out to @xmath2 for each galaxy spectral grouping and agree well with comparable local determinations .",
    "the faint end slopes are the same for rest frame @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for each galaxy spectral grouping .",
    "we assume galaxy lfs for a particular galaxy spectral grouping and rest frame wavelength change with redshift only through variations in @xmath4 ( and @xmath102 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath3 , choosing a mean value from the set of full two parameter lf fits , to obtain values of @xmath4 for each galaxy spectral grouping in each of the redshift bins .",
    "we find that @xmath52 galaxies become brighter with @xmath5 with @xmath6 at all rest frame bands studied here , where @xmath7/\\delta{z}$ ] , while galaxies with detectable emission lines ( i.e. star forming galaxies ) , which dominate the total sample , show a smaller change in @xmath4 with redshift at all bands , @xmath8 , becoming larger only at 2400 .",
    "passive evolution models of galaxies are in reasonable agreement with these results for absorption line dominated galaxies , while plausible star formation histories can reproduce the behavior of the emission line galaxies .",
    "the major discrepancy with the specific set of galaxy spectral synthesis models we adopt , those of poggianti ( 1997 ) , is the prediction of much more luminosity evolution at rest frame @xmath16 for galaxies with a brief single initial burst of star formation than is actually inferred from our analysis of quiescent galaxies .",
    "this problem appears to be eliminated when poggianti s very recent unpublished ( poggianti 2001 ; private communication ) models are used .",
    "our naive view as illustrated in figure 14 of cohen _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) of the @xmath15 universe is one sparsely populated with bright blue galaxies , but we now see that this is too simplistic .",
    "the co - moving number density of @xmath52 galaxies drops rapidly beyond @xmath215 , but the sed analysis shows clearly that this is due to them becoming eros which are too faint to be included in our @xmath17-selected sample . correcting for this , the co - moving number density appears to be roughly constant for each of the various galaxy spectral groupings , until the highest redshift bin is reached .",
    "there , for @xmath73 , the apparent number density is a factor of @xmath1210 low at all bands .",
    "we correct for selection effects resulting from the variation of our ability to determine redshifts as a function of @xmath5 itself by throwing all galaxies without redshifts within the magnitude cutoffs of the sample into the highest @xmath5 bin .",
    "we also make a generous allowance for galaxies near the faint end of the sample that are missing from the ground based photometric catalogs .",
    "these , with several other smaller factors , are just barely sufficient when applied at their maximum possible values to allow constant co - moving number density from @xmath60 to 1.5 , with considerable uncertainty at the highest redshift range . if less extreme correction factors are used , the co - moving number density of luminous galaxies begins to decline at @xmath121 .",
    "we calculate co - moving luminosity densities .",
    "we find that the contributions to the total change as one would expect .",
    "galaxies , being redder , contribute a larger fraction of the luminosity density at longer rest frame wavelengths .",
    "we then use galaxy evolution models to extrapolate back to @xmath147 the co - moving luminosity densities at @xmath18 for each redshift bin ( see table  [ table_ml ] ) . from this",
    ", we can then calculate the total stellar mass in galaxies which appears to be constant to within 15% over this redshift range .",
    "we confirm that the uv luminosity density , an indicator of star formation , increased by a factor of @xmath124 over the period @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we find the co - moving number density and the stellar mass in galaxies to be approximately constant out to @xmath10 , and with more uncertainty , to @xmath130 .",
    "the major epoch(s ) of star formation and of galaxy formation must have occurred even earlier .",
    "an examination of alternate possibilities for the assumptions made here shows that while the values of the lf parameters themselves ( i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) may depend on the detailed assumptions made in the analysis , parameters involving integration over the lf , such as the luminosity density , are robust .    in spite of our best efforts , and with a total sample of 735 objects with redshifts in this field ,",
    "the numbers of galaxies are still small in the highest redshift bin considered here with @xmath73 . to attempt a fainter magnitude limited survey with existing telescopes and instrumentation",
    "would be extremely expensive in terms of observing time .",
    "our plans for future work to extend and reinforce these results will concentrate on targeted surveys guided by photometric criteria for candidate selection .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",

    "we give the sed parameters for six galaxies in the flanking fields from the twelve new redshifts from dawson _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) . ( the other six are fainter than the cutoffs adopted here . )",
    "five of these are in the @xmath17-selected sample ; all are in the @xmath18-selected sample . based on the description of their spectra given by dawson _",
    "_ five are @xmath65 galaxies while f36398_1602 , is assigned a galaxy spectral class of @xmath52 .",
    "the sbb sed model was used to derive the parameters given in table  [ table_dawson ] .",
    "because of our small sample size and wide redshift range , we needed to make several simplifying assumptions to achieve a satisfactory lf analysis of our data . in the main body of this paper",
    ", we followed conventional ideas about the anticipated evolution of the lf , assuming that @xmath3 remains fixed with redshift , while @xmath4 changes .",
    "note that this does not amount to assuming pure luminosity evolution , as @xmath102 is determined from the data , and the number density is never constrained to be constant with redshift .    in this appendix , at the suggestion of the referee , we explore the opposite extreme assumption .",
    "we assume that @xmath94 is fixed with redshift , and that @xmath3 may vary with @xmath5 . in this case , unlike in the former , the values of @xmath102 for a specified galaxy spectral grouping in the various redshift bins can not be intercompared to yield the relative number density of galaxies . furthermore , any discussion of the evolution of @xmath4 with redshift is meaningless , as @xmath4 is fixed .",
    "we calculate the luminosity density , which we expect to be the most robust parameter in our analysis , as it , together with the total number of galaxies per unit volume brighter than some specified cutoff , both represent integrals over the lf .",
    "the results for the modified assumptions are given in table  [ table_fixlstar ] .",
    "we compare @xmath137 with the luminosity densities at rest frame @xmath17 given in table  [ table_lumdens ] .",
    "the comparison is very good ; the two values of @xmath137 dagree to within 20% over the entire redshift range for each of the six galaxy spectral groups .",
    "since these represent the extreme opposite assumptions that can be made in the lf analysis , we conclude that the determination of luminosity densities is very robust , as expected .",
    "we expect both solutions discussed here , that with @xmath3 fixed given in the main body of this paper , or that with @xmath4 fixed as given in this appendix , to be satisfactory fits to the data .",
    "we consider next whether there is any way we can judge which of these two is more likely to be valid . the banana - shaped error contours in the 2d space with axes @xmath237 ( see figures  [ figure_errors_a ] to [ figure_errors_all ] ) form the basis for our treatment .",
    "we proceed to diagonalize the covariance matrix by defining a new coordinate system which follows the long major axis of the banana - shaped error contours with a second axis perpendicular to that .",
    "we measure the difference between the constrained solution obtained by fixing @xmath3 or alternatively @xmath4 ( i.e. the solutions given in tables  [ table_fixa ] and [ table_fixlstar ] ) and the full two parameter solution given in table  [ table2p ] in units of @xmath78 . to accomplish this ,",
    "we examine each of the error contours in the @xmath237 plane and measure @xmath238 and @xmath239 in these `` long '' and `` short '' coordinates .",
    "figure  [ figure_error_circles ] presents the results for rest - frame @xmath17 .",
    "the large circles represent 1@xmath78 rms difference .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath238 , while the vertical axis is @xmath239 .",
    "three redshift bins were used , @xmath128 , @xmath80 and @xmath68 , for each of three galaxy spectral groupings .",
    "the galaxy spectral groupings used are all galaxies , @xmath52 galaxies and @xmath240 galaxies .",
    "the latter two are chosen as they are believed to be the pair which sum to the whole sample and which are most likely to be stable in terms of technical problems over the range of redshift considered here ( see  [ 2pshec ] and [ section_overall ] ) .",
    "on the left side of the figure are the differences for the solution where @xmath3 is fixed , while on the right are the solutions for the case when @xmath4 is held fixed .",
    "we see that both of these assumptions lead to reasonably good solutions , lying within a difference of less than @xmath103 ( i.e. within the large circles ) in most cases . for the @xmath52 galaxies , where the sample is very small and the errors",
    "are quite large ( see table  [ table_fixa ] and [ table_fixlstar ] for the corresponding uncertainties in the @xmath237 plane ) , little distinction is possible . however , when one looks at the other two spectral classes presented in this figure , where the samples are much larger , the solution with fixed @xmath4 has slightly larger deviations ( appearing as a larger mean distance of the points from the center of the circle ) than does the solution with fixed @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore can have at least some degree of confidence that luminosity evolution is in fact ocurring in our sample . only with a larger , deeper , better sample",
    "will we be able to refine this analysis and this potential discriminant .",
