    "on a probability space @xmath1 , consider a one - dimensional jump diffusion process @xmath2 whose dynamics is governed by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath3 in which @xmath4 is a @xmath5-dimensional wiener process , @xmath6 is a pure jump lvy process , independent of the wiener process , with its lvy measure denoted by @xmath7",

    "the value function of this problem is defined as @xmath11,\\ ] ] in which @xmath12 is the set of all stopping times valued between @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "a specific example of such an optimal stopping problem is the american option pricing problem , where @xmath9 model the logarithm of the stock price process and @xmath8 represents the pay - off function .",
    "the value function @xmath14 is expected to satisfy a variational inequality with a nonlocal integral term ( see e.g. chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "when the diffusion component of @xmath9 may vanish , different concepts of solutions were employed to characterize the value function .",
    "pham used the notion of viscosity solution in @xcite . also see @xcite , @xcite for more recent results in this direction .",
    "lamberton and mikou worked with lvy processes and showed in @xcite that the value function can be understood in the distribution sense .    when the diffusion component in @xmath9 is nondegenerate , the value function is expected to have higher degree of regularity .",

    "the intuition is that the diffusions component dominates the contribution from jumps in determining the regularity of solutions , no matter what the variation of the jumps are .",
    "however this intuition is only a folklore theorem for obstacle problems .",
    "there are some limited results available whose assumptions on obstacles , domains , and the structure of the jumps may not be appropriate for financial applications .",
    "for example , bensoussan and lions analyzed an obstacle problem for jump diffusions where jumps may have finite / infinite activity with finite / infinite variation ; see in theorem 3.2 in @xcite on pp .",

    "when irregular obstacles are considered , the jumps are usually restricted to finite activity or infinite activity with finite variation cases .",

    "more recently , davis et al . in @xcite , generalizing the results in @xcite for the diffusion case , analyzed an impulse control problems for jump diffusions with infinite activity but finite variation jumps .",
    "a regularity result which treats obstacle problems with irregular obstacles and infinite variation jumps has been missing in the literature .    in this paper , we consider jump diffusions with finite / infinite activity and finite / infinite variational jumps .",
    "we show in theorem  [ thm : main ] that the value function of an obstacle problem solves a variational inequality for almost all points in the domain , and it is an element in @xmath0 ( see later this section for the definition of this sobolev space ) .",
    "this regularity result directly implies that the smooth fit property holds and the value function is @xmath15 inside the continuation region .",
