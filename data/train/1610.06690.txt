    "black hole predicted by einstein s general relativity is characterized by the black hole horizon from which even light rays can not escape .",
    "besides the black hole horizon , if a black hole is rotating , it has the ergoregion , where light rays can not propagate to the counter rotating direction of the black hole .",
    "when we consider the wave scattering , rotating black holes can amplify waves and this phenomenon is called superradiance @xcite . from the analysis of the wave scattering , it turns out that superradiance with some boundary conditions can evoke instabilities of waves . for example , considering the scattering of massive fields in the kerr spacetime or massless fields in the kerr - ads spacetime , the wave is confined around the black hole due to a wall of effective potential for waves and the superradiant scattering occurs repeatedly .",
    "the amplitude of the wave finally grows exponentially in time .",
    "this kind of instability is called the superradiant instability @xcite . while even in the case that there is no potential wall for confinement , the wave also suffers from the instability if there exist the reflective inner boundary such as the surface of stars ( ergoregion instability )  @xcite . to examine the properties of superradiance associated with the kerr spacetime , we can use analogue model of black holes .",
    "one of the analogues based on fluid models are called acoustic black holes .",
    "let us consider a transonic flow of a fluid and investigate the behavior of small acoustic disturbances of the fluid ( acoustic wave ) .",
    "if the flow has a sonic surface , the acoustic wave can not pass through the sonic surface from the downstream to the upstream .",
    "namely , the sonic surface behaves as the black hole horizon for the acoustic wave ( acoustic horizon ) .",
    "furthermore , the perturbation of the velocity potential obeys the klein - gordon equation in a  curved \" spacetime of which geometry is defined by the acoustic metric  @xcite . that is why this kind of analogue model is called acoustic black holes ( see also , ref .",
    "although the motivation of the original work @xcite by unruh was to investigate the hawking radiation with the acoustic black hole in laboratories , it has been followed by some papers examining the feature of superradiance for the acoustic wave as well . to realize the rotating acoustic black hole in laboratories , several experimental setups or models",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the draining bathtub model  @xcite is one example of such a flow of which acoustic metric has a similar structure to the kerr metric . in this model ,",
    "the flow is stationary and axisymmetric in a two dimensional plane .",
    "the acoustic horizon is a closed circle where the radial velocity of the background flow exceeds the sound velocity of the fluid .",
    "the analogue structure of the ergoregion also exists .",
    "there are several works considering the acoustic black holes in astrophysical situations .",
    "the original idea of the the acoustic geometry in fluids was proposed by moncrief @xcite to examine the stability of the accretion flow onto a schwarzschild black hole . in moncrief",
    "s analysis , the acoustic wave in the accretion flow was shown to satisfy the klein - gordon type wave equation .",
    "some papers apply the idea of the acoustic black holes to astrophysical phenomena @xcite . especially , abraham _ et al . _",
    "@xcite treat the axially symmetric accretion flow onto a kerr black hole and discuss a situation similar to the draining bathtub model with acoustic superradiance .",
    "when we apply the method of acoustic black holes to astrophysical problems , we should consider the effects of the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , due to the angular momentum transportation caused by the magnetic viscosity , matters in the accretion disk can fall efficiently onto the central compact object @xcite .",
    "hence when we discuss the acoustic black hole in the magnetized fluid such as in accretion disks , we need to take into account of the magnetic field and generalize the acoustic black hole to the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) case . in this paper",
    ", we define the acoustic black hole in a mhd flow ( magnetoacoustic black holes ) .",
    "we obtain a stationary and axisymmetric two dimensional newtonian mhd inflow with a sink at the center under the ideal mhd approximation .",
    "we find that magnetoacoustic geometries are characterized by two parameters representing the sound velocity in the fluid and the angular velocity of the magnetic field line at the radial alfvn point , where the radial velocity of the fluid coincides with the radial component of the alfvn velocity .",
    "since there are two magnetoacoustic wave modes ( fast and slow modes ) in two dimensional mhd flows , acoustic metrics for each wave modes are introduced and it turns out that the magnetoacoustic geometries are classified to five types according to values of the two parameters characterizing the background flow .",
