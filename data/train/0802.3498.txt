    "in recent years , major experimental advances have been made in contacting and measuring single molecules in three - terminal transport junctions  @xcite , detecting the vibration  @xcite , spin  @xcite and magnetic properties  @xcite . using the electrical gate to control the transport one can perform a substantial analysis of the transport processes , even when detailed microscopic information about the junction is lacking .",
    "single - electron and coherent multi - electron tunneling processes ( cotunneling , kondo effect ) governed by strong coulomb and electron - vibration interactions allow detailed information to be extracted , as demonstrated recently for a single oligo - phenelyne molecule  @xcite",
    ". more detailed information can be accessed when mechanical control of a gateable junction  @xcite is possible . in the light of this progress of experimental possibilities",
    "the interesting question arises how quantum mechanical states involving both electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom may be detected and , perhaps , controlled in transport measurements .",
    "a particularly interesting aspect of single - molecule devices is the strong coupling of the electron current to the mechanical motion and the fully quantum mechanical character of this motion , resulting in franck - condon ( fc ) resonances  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in molecular systems with magnetic ions , the spin degree of freedom becomes important  @xcite .",
    "thus interesting magnetic electro - mechanical effects are to be expected  @xcite .",
    "mixed - valence molecules exhibit this interplay of quantum nanomechanics and spin - tronics .",
    "they are crucial also as a building block for supra - molecular devices and serve as benchmark for such systems . in a mixed - valence dimer ,",
    "sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , an excess electron can be localized on either of two equivalent metal ions with a local spin , thereby locally distorting the positions of the ligand atoms coordinating the ion . as the electron becomes delocalized over the molecule the distortion is `` dragged '' along coherently . as discussed in detail by bersuker and borshch",
    "this results in vibronic mixing i.e. the molecular eigenstates do not allow an adiabatic born - oppenheimer ( bo ) separation of the nuclear and electronic motions  @xcite .",
    "the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom become entangled into _ vibronic states _ due to a _ spin - dependent _ pseudo jahn - teller ( pjt ) effect . in general ,",
    "pjt mixing of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom can not be neglected whenever electronic energy surfaces come close in energy ( not necessarily degenerate as in the jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "the pronounced dependence of the delocalization , and hence of the pjt mixing , on the total spin of the molecule arises due to local direct exchange interaction on the ions ( hund s rule ) , which favors the excess electron spin to be aligned with the ionic spin .",
    "simultaneously , in such molecules this spin - dependent kinetic energy gain is responsible for the ferromagnetic double - exchange interaction  @xcite which competes with other types of exchange interaction .    in this paper , we present transport calculations for a model representative of a class of mixed - valence molecules .",
    "we demonstrate that a single - electron transport current can both detect and control the molecular spin due to the non - equilibrium nature of the vibrational motion .",
    "as indicated above , this does not rely on weak spin - orbit effects , but rather on strong direct , kinetic and double - exchange mechanisms .",
    "the pseudo jahn - teller dynamics shows up in pronounced sets of vibronic conductance peaks which depend on the spin - values of the molecular excitations .",
    "this provides a way to detect the spin without a magnetic field and probe the _ in - situ _ properties of a mixed - valence molecular transistor .",
    "conversely , we show that the electronic transport current induces non - equilibrium quantized molecular vibrations which drive a pronounced population inversion among the spin - states .",
    "such a molecule can thereby be switched to a state with a well - defined charge and spin by adjusting the applied voltages .",
    "this vibration - induced spin control arises from the interplay of spin and vibrations intrinsic to mixed - valence molecules , which may open up new possibilities for detection of mechanical motion and dissipation , magnetic switching and bistability .",
    "we study the non - equilibrium transport properties of a well - established model for mixed - valence dimers from chemical physics , see  @xcite and the references therein for detailed discussions .",
    "the model describes the simplest type of molecule exhibiting the spin - vibration interplay , consisting of two identical transition - metal ions , labeled by @xmath0 .",
    "we account for orbital - degenerate electronic states , @xmath1 , where an excess electron with spin projection @xmath2 is localized on ion @xmath3 . within the molecule",
    ", the electron can tunnel with amplitude @xmath4 between the ions via a mechanically stiff bridging ligand .    .",
    "by applying a bias voltage , @xmath5 , electrons can tunnel from one electrode to the other via the molecule . a third gate terminal ( not shown ) , coupled capacitively to the molecule , effectively shifts the molecular energy levels .",
    ", width=264 ]    in addition , the atomic groups that form a ligand - shell around each ion can vibrate along the local totally symmetric nuclear coordinate @xmath6 ( breathing mode ) . in the absence of an excess electron , this vibration around @xmath7",
    "is assumed to be harmonic with frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the excess electron , however , distorts the ligand - shell of the ion on which it resides , leading to a significant shift of the potential minimum of this mode ( change in bond - lengths ) . in units of the zero - point motion energy of the vibration , this shift is equal to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the dimensionless electron - vibration coupling . in line with many experimental findings , we assume charging effects ( coulomb blockade ) to be strong enough that only two molecular charge states need to be accounted for",
    ". the vibrational parts of the hamiltonians @xmath11 for @xmath12 excess electrons on the molecule , written in the molecular vibrational coordinates @xmath13 , read @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the occupation operator of ion @xmath3 and @xmath16 creates an electron in state @xmath17 .",
    "the symmetric coordinate , @xmath18 , is the _ molecular _ breathing mode , which couples to the total excess charge , @xmath19 , of the molecule , resulting in a shift by @xmath10 of its potential surface along @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting fc transport effects have been investigated theoretically  @xcite and found experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the anti - symmetric mode , @xmath20 , couples to the internal charge imbalance @xmath21 . together with the intra - molecular tunneling , @xmath4 , this results in the pseudo jahn - teller ( pjt ) effect  @xcite , i.e. the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h_vib_pjt ] ) mixes electronic and vibrational states of the mode @xmath20 .",
    "one of the crucial aspects in a mixed - valence molecular transistor is that the non - trivial dynamics of the @xmath20 mode depends on the relative orientation of the local transition - metal ion spins .",
    "the molecular hamiltonian for @xmath12 excess electrons reads @xmath22 the intra - ionic hund interaction , @xmath23 , couples the spin of the excess electron , @xmath24 , to the spin of the transition - metal ions , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the vector of pauli - matrices and @xmath27 if no electron is present on ion @xmath3 . together with the intra - molecular tunneling , @xmath4 , incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_vib_pjt ] ) , the intra - ionic hund interaction results in a double - exchange splitting @xmath28 of eigenstates with total molecular spin @xmath29  @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the spin - length of the equivalent ions ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "result  ( [ eq : ts ] ) for the effective tunneling strength @xmath33 is obtained by expressing @xmath34 in the electronic basis of total spin eigenstates using vector coupling coefficients . in the semi - classical limit of large ionic spins",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 ( not considered further below ) , this reduces to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the angle between the two classical ionic spins .",
    "this makes clear that the kinetic energy which can be gained by the excess electron is maximal for parallel ionic spins due to the strong intra - ionic coupling and is suppressed by @xmath38 , i.e. by the electron spin - eigenfunction component quantized in the direction of the ionic spin .",
    "importantly , in mixed - valence molecules @xmath23 is much larger than the other energy scales , @xmath39 ( typical values : @xmath40  1  ev , @xmath41  1 - 100 mev , @xmath42  tens of mev )  @xcite .",
    "this scale separation derives from the intra-_ionic _ origin of @xmath23 ( direct hund exchange ) , in contrast to the intra-_molecular _ processes involved in the exchange @xmath43 and hopping @xmath4 .",
    "we assume a ferromagnetic coupling , @xmath44 , i.e. a less than half filled ionic shell .",
    "the excitations where @xmath25 and @xmath45 are aligned anti - parallel can therefore be neglected .",
    "( [ eq : h_mv ] ) also incorporates the intra - molecular coupling @xmath43 of the spins of different ions . from hereon",
    "we take the length of the ionic spins to be @xmath46 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the charged molecule consists of an @xmath47 and an @xmath48 diagonal block , with @xmath49 sub - blocks on the diagonal , given by @xmath50 this makes explicit the interesting property of mixed - valence molecules , that the strength of the pjt effect depends on the total molecular spin @xmath29  @xcite due to the competition between the local distortion ( coupling @xmath51 ) and the effective delocalization of the electron ( energy @xmath33 ) . for @xmath52",
    "we numerically diagonalize the blocks separately for each spin state @xmath29 to obtain the molecular eigenstates , which are not of the adiabatic bo form . for @xmath53",
    "the states trivially factorize in bo form .",
    "the interplay of vibrational and spin degrees of freedom can be demonstrated for the basic transistor setup , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , described by the transport hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "here @xmath55 , where @xmath56 projects onto states with charge @xmath19 and @xmath57 is the gate coupling .",
    "the electrodes @xmath58 at electrochemical potential @xmath59 and temperature @xmath60 are described by @xmath61 i.e. @xmath62 is the bias voltage , and couple to the molecule by @xmath63 here @xmath64 creates an electron with spin @xmath2 in state @xmath65 of electrode @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the amplitude for tunneling to ion @xmath3 of the dimer .",
    "we assume a sequential arrangement i.e. @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which may experimentally be favored by appropriate design of `` clipping '' ligands . here",
    "@xmath70 denotes the tunneling rate .    in three - terminal molecular junctions",
    ", the tunneling rate can be as small as @xmath71  mev and is often the smallest energy scale in the problem , enabling accurate spectroscopy of e.g. molecular vibrations  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the regime of voltages and temperatures ( @xmath72 ) where single - electron tunneling dominates the transport as is the case in many experiments  @xcite . using a kinetic ( master ) equation",
    "we calculate the non - equilibrium stationary state occupations of the molecule for each charge ( @xmath19 ) and spin multiplet ( @xmath29 ) , keeping track of the symmetric vibrational ( @xmath18 ) quantum number as well as the quantum number for the entangled state of the electrons and the anti - symmetric vibrations ( @xmath20 ) . for weak tunnel coupling",
    "the transport rates can be evaluated in lowest non - vanishing order in @xmath73 ( i.e. fermi s golden rule ) . additionally , we account phenomenologically for relaxation due to coupling to a dissipative environment ( e.g. substrate phonons ) .",
    "we assume an energy - dependent density of states ( rate @xmath74 ) for transitions between states with equal spin ( @xmath75 ) and different spin ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the latter relate to spin - orbit coupling effects and are therefore assumed to be much smaller than the former , @xmath77 .",
    "the strength of the spin - allowed relaxation of course depends on the type of the molecular vibration mode and the junction substrate . for examples and discussion of very slow relaxation in the context of photon - tunneling in single - molecule junctions ,",
    "see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "c    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for a wide range of parameters , the model exhibits a second , even more striking effect , exemplified for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 in fig .  [ fig : result_blockade](a ) . at low energies ,",
    "the current is stepwise _ reduced _ when going deeper into the sequential tunneling region leading to negative differential conductance ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_blockade](a ) ) .",
    "simultaneously , the occupation of the molecular state with zero - spin and no vibrational excitations grows , reaching over 90% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result_blockade](b ) ) . within this region the current",
    "is strongly suppressed due to the pronounced population inversion that stabilizes the charge to @xmath53 and the spin to @xmath81 .",
    "this _ vibration - induced spin - blockade _ provides another indication for the spin properties of the mixed - valence molecule and additionally allows the spin to be controlled electrically .",
    "the effect is readily understood by considering the non - equilibrium vibrations induced by the electric current .",
    "first we note that in the low - bias region where the spin - blockade occurs , the direct transition by electron tunneling from @xmath82 is energetically not yet possible and the transition @xmath83 is generally forbidden by spin selection rule ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "now consider an electron which has just enough energy to excite a vibrational , @xmath85 , ( or vibronic , @xmath86 ) quantum , when entering / leaving the molecule ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "if the molecule does not immediately relax it can accumulate more quanta in subsequent tunneling processes as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_blockade](c ) .",
    "eventually , when a sufficient amount of vibrational energy has been accumulated a low energy electron can be assisted to excite the molecular spin - system .",
    "this tunneling process brings the molecule to a lower spin state with @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the molecule can relax to the @xmath81 state by a single tunneling process in which the excess energy is dissipated into the electrodes .",
    "now the molecule is trapped in a state with fixed charge @xmath53 and spin @xmath81 and the current is suppressed : neither the @xmath47 states ( due to the spin selection rule ) nor the @xmath48 state ( due to the low bias voltage @xmath88 and a strong coulomb interaction on the molecule ) are accessible .",
    "[ fig : result_blockade](b ) shows that the spin - blockade is lifted at higher bias @xmath89 where the direct process back to @xmath48 becomes possible , thereby confirming the above mechanism .    clearly , the vibration induced spin - blockade is expected to break down when the excited spin state is too high in energy to be reached or when escape processes from @xmath81 become dominant already at low bias voltages .",
    "the escape processes , however , have to change the spin by _ at least _ 1 quantum and are therefore parametrically weak , since they relate to spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath90 ) or higher order tunneling processes . for instance , the phenomenological spin - flip relaxation which we included is responsible for the small remnant current in the spin - blockade region .",
    "secondly , the blocking state has to be reached : the single - electron transport current `` pumps '' the vibrational system ( rate @xmath91 ) when the temperature is lowered below the vibrational frequency @xmath8 ( preventing thermal relaxation ) and when the tunnel coupling is sufficiently weak .",
    "it is thus crucial that the intra - molecular vibrations are not strongly damped .",
    "however , relaxation rates can compete with the transport rates without destroying the vibration - induced spin - blockade as long as the @xmath48 state can still be efficiently reached using the vibrations . for the results we present here",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "finally , cotunneling processes are expected to affect both the access to and the escape from the blocking state .",
    "a full calculation of this effect is possible in principle  @xcite , but is prohibited by the large number of states required here to describe the vibration - induced spin - blockade .",
    "inspection of the numerically calculated rates to second order in @xmath70 for a truncated spectrum indicates that the presented results are robust against perturbations due to higher - order tunneling .",
    "importantly , these processes can be suppressed by reducing the tunneling coupling by appropriate choice of connecting ligand groups .",
    "we note that in this paper we have discussed the case of ferromagnetic intra - molecular coupling @xmath43 .",
    "however , the vibration - induced spin - blockade is generic and also occurs for anti - ferromagnetic coupling @xmath92 provided that @xmath93 and in this case leads to a stabilized _ excess charge _",
    "@xmath52 and _ high spin _ @xmath47 .",
    "using a representative model we have demonstrated that transport through a mixed - valence molecular transistor entails an interplay of delocalized excess electrons , localized ionic spins , ligand - shell vibrations and coulomb blockade . for this class of molecules",
    "transport - induced intra - molecular vibrations depend on the spin and their energy can be transferred to the spin - system at specific voltages , subsequently `` locking '' the spin , vibration and charge in a well - defined state .",
    "the generic model , analyzed here in a non - equilibrium situation , relates naturally to mixed - valence molecules  @xcite such as ru@xmath94 complexes with pyridine organic ligands of the robin - day class ii or iii .",
    "the effects predicted here provide several bridges between nano - electromechanical systems ( nems ) and spintronic devices and applications in this direction can be envisaged .",
    "clearly , the predicted spin - blockade effect will be sensitive to local magnetic fields , mechanical energy dissipation and spin - orbit effects and sensing applications involving these can be considered .",
    "also , the blockade effect indicates slow transport dynamics : this may be used in the context of switching and bistable operation of molecular transistors by sweeping voltages non - adiabatically , with the new possibility of magnetic field control due to the involvement of spin .",
    "finally , from a chemistry perspective , transport measurements provide unique insight in the degree of electron delocalization determining the key properties of mixed - valence molecules _ embedded _ in an electric circuit .",
    "thus the investigation of complex mixed - valence systems as devices  @xcite proves to be an interesting avenue in single - molecule electronics ."
