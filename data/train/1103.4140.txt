    "the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) is a longstanding problem in astrophysics .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are thought to be the origin of galactic crs .",
    "the most popular snr acceleration mechanism is diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , _ fermi _ and _ agile _ show that middle - aged snrs ( @xmath0 ) interacting with molecular clouds emit gev gamma rays with broken power law spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( hereafter , these references are referred to as obs ) .",
    "considering a stellar wind before the supernova explosion , the molecular cloud has been swept away by the stellar wind .",
    "the inner radius of the molecular cloud becomes typically about a few tens of parsecs .",
    "then , the snr collides with the molecular cloud at typically @xmath1 later and the broken power law spectra of gev gamma rays can be interpreted as the inelastic collision between molecular clouds and cr nuclei that have escaped from the snr ( hadronic processes ) @xcite .",
    "however , observations do not rule out contributions from bremsstrahlung emission due to cr electrons ( leptonic processes ) .",
    "snrs have been also observed by tev gamma - ray telescopes , and it is still unclear whether the tev gamma - ray emission is produced via inverse compton scattering of cr electrons ( leptonic processes ) or hadronic processes .",
    "there are many tev - unid sources in our galaxy , and their emission mechanisms are also still unclear . old or middle - aged snrs are the candidates of the tev - unid sources @xcite .",
    "thus , it is crucial to identify the emission mechanism of gamma rays .",
    "positrons and neutrinos are produced in hadronic processes .",
    "on the other hand , they are not produced in leptonic processes . but this reaction rate is suppressed by the fine structure constant compared with the gamma - ray production rate of inverse compton scattering . ]",
    "therefore , direct or indirect detections of these particles will enable us to identify the emission mechanism in gamma - ray sources .",
    "recently , the cr positron excess has been provided by pamela @xcite .",
    "although the origin of this excess has been investigated in many theoretical studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , it still remains unclear .",
    "snrs have been discussed as the candidates of the positron sources @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to observe the positron production at snrs .",
    "gamma - ray telescopes showed that the photon flux above @xmath2 from snrs with an age of about @xmath3 is @xmath4 ( obs ) .",
    "if the gamma rays have a hadronic origin , about the same numbers of positrons are produced .",
    "when those positrons lose their energy sufficiently , about @xmath5 percent of them would make positroniums with ambient electrons , and one fourth of them would decay into two photons with the energy of @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this means that we can expect the @xmath6 photon flux of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "this flux is sufficiently high for five - years observations of the future advanced compton telescope ( act ) to detect .    in this letter ,",
    "considering the interaction between cr protons and molecular clouds , we estimate annihilation emission of secondary positrons produced by the cr protons .",
    "we partly refer to analyses of previous works concerning the @xmath6 line from the galactic center @xcite and the galactic plane @xcite , and we apply their treatments to middle - aged snrs interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "recent review of positron annihilation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we first provide some timescales for cr protons , secondary positrons and electrons inside a molecular cloud ( section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "we then solve energy spectra of the secondary positrons and electrons ( section [ sec:3 ] ) and calculate the annihilation line flux as well as the continuum spectrum ( section [ sec:4 ] ) .",

    "the black solid line shows the diffusion time with @xmath10.,width=302 ]    in this section , we briefly summarize relevant timescales of crs in a molecular cloud .",
    "physical quantities of molecular clouds associated with gamma - ray sources have not been understood in detail .",
    "observations suggest that the gas number density is about @xmath11 , the size is of the order of @xmath12 ( obs ) , and the magnetic field in molecular clouds is about @xmath13 @xcite . in this letter , for the molecular cloud we adopt values of the gas number density @xmath14 , the size @xmath8 and the magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "we consider ionization and inelastic collisions with nuclei as cooling processes of cr protons . on the other hand ,",
    "we include ionization , bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emission , and inverse compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as cooling processes of secondary positrons and electrons . for snrs observed by _",
    "fermi _ and _ agile _ , snrs interact with molecular clouds and the expansion of the snrs is strongly decelerated .",
    "therefore , we here do not consider the adiabatic cooling .",
    "we here define @xmath15 as a cooling time , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the kinetic energy and the energy loss rate , respectively .",
    "we adopt an expression of @xmath17 for protons given in @xcite , and that for positrons and electrons given in @xcite .",
    "the timescale of direct annihilation of positrons and electrons is represented by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number density of positrons or electrons , the cross section of the annihilation @xcite and the velocity of secondary electrons or positrons , respectively .",
    "the electron density , @xmath21 , is dominated by thermal electrons and the positron density , @xmath22 , is very small , so that we can neglect the annihilation of secondary electrons .",
    "the escape time through diffusion is written by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is notable that so far the diffusion coefficient around an snr has not been understood well .",
    "thus we assume the diffusion coefficient in molecular clouds to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the velocity of light . here",
    "@xmath27 might be reasonable as the galactic mean value @xcite , but @xmath28 should be preferred in surroundings of snrs @xcite , so that we use @xmath28 in this letter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show those relevant timescales .",
    "the blue line shows the cooling time of secondary electrons and positrons where the synchrotron cooing dominates above @xmath29 , the bremsstrahlung cooling dominates from @xmath30 to @xmath29 , and the ionization loss dominates below @xmath30 .",
    "the green line shows the cooling time of cr protons where the pion production cooing dominate above @xmath30 and the ionization loss dominates below 1 gev .",
    "cr protons ( about @xmath30 ) producing most positrons do not cool and escape as long as the snr age is smaller than the cooling time of @xmath30 protons .",
    "cooling times of ionization , bremsstrahlung emission and inelastic collision are inversely proportional to the gas density . therefore , spectral evolutions of all crs below @xmath30 depends on only the density .",
    "the black line shows the escape time due to diffusion with @xmath28 .",
    "the escape of secondary electrons and positrons is negligible compared with the energy loss .",
    "the typical energy of positrons produced by the cr protons is about @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "then its cooling time is about @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , snrs with an age longer than its cooling time can produce low energy positrons . once positrons have cooled to @xmath33 , they form positroniums through charge exchange . there are four possible spin configurations of the positroniums . one of them has the total spin @xmath34 ( singlet ) and the three others have the total spin @xmath35 ( triplet ) .",
    "the singlet state produces @xmath6 line photons , and the triplet state produces continuum photons below @xmath6 . because both the singlet and the triplet state are produced at the same rate , one fourth of positroniums can decay into two @xmath6 line photons .",
    "it is remarkable that the annihilation time is approximately @xmath36 times longer than the cooling time of positrons at around @xmath37 .",
    "then while the positron is being cooled , approximately @xmath36@xmath38 percent of positrons directly annihilate with electrons .",
    "they produce continuum photons above @xmath6 .",
    "and @xmath39 . the green ,",
    "red and blue lines show cr protons , secondary positrons and electrons spectra , respectively.,width=302 ]    in this section , to calculate the photon spectrum from secondary positrons and electrons produced by cr protons , we calculate energy spectra of positrons and electrons , @xmath40 .",
    "an evolution of cr spectra is described by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the source term of crs , the third and the fourth terms of the left hand side are sink terms due to annihilation and diffusion , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the diffusion escape for secondary electrons and positrons is negligible , so that we neglect the diffusion escape .",
    "then the solution for secondary positrons and electrons , @xmath43 , can be expressed by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is time for cooling from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , and defined by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the initial energy of positrons or electrons before they cool to @xmath16 and defined by @xmath50 we can neglect the annihilation loss for secondary electrons because the timescale is much longer than the snr age .    using the code provided by @xcite ,",
    "we calculate secondary positrons and electrons source spectra , @xmath51 , and the gamma - ray spectrum produced by decaying unstable hadrons such as pions and kaons .",
    "in addition , for the high - energy electron source @xmath52 , we consider knock - on electrons produced by coulomb collisions with cr protons @xcite .",
    "the knock - on electrons contribute somewhat to the continuum emission as bremsstrahlung emission .    to obtain the source term of secondary positrons and electrons @xmath53",
    ", we need to calculate the spectral evolution of cr protons .",
    "cr protons are injected from snrs to molecular clouds in an energy - dependent way @xcite . moreover , the diffusion escape from molecular clouds should be considered for cr protons above @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , we do not need to calculate the precise spectrum of cr protons above @xmath30 because thanks to _ agile _ and _ fermi _ , we have already known spectra of cr protons above @xmath30 . that is , we do not need to calculate the spectral evolution due to the diffusion escape for cr protons . on the other hand",
    ", we have to calculate the evolution of the spectrum of cr protons below @xmath30 because gamma - ray spectra do not tell us the spectrum of cr protons below @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the injection of cr protons is thought to stop when snr shock collides with molecular clouds @xcite , that is , the injection of cr protons stopped of the order of @xmath55 ago .",
    "therefore , we assume that cr protons are injected as a delta function in time and an effective steep - spectrum , @xmath56 , instead of neglecting the diffusion escape @xmath57 where @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the proton mass .",
    "this expression gives an injection term of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the momentum of the cr proton .",
    "observations show that spectra of cr protons have broken power - law forms and the spectral index above the break is @xmath63 except for w44 ( obs ) . in this letter",
    ", we adopt the single power law with @xmath64 ( this assumption does not affect the flux of the annihilation line significantly ) .",
    "then , the solution to equation ( [ eq : df ] ) for cr protons , @xmath65 , can be expressed by @xmath66 as mentioned in previous section , the cooling of crs below @xmath30 depends on only the density .",
    "hence , the solution ( equation ( [ eq : fcr ] ) ) depends on only @xmath67 .    to calculate source terms of secondary electrons and positrons , @xmath68 , in equation ( [ eq : f ] ) , we approximately use the present spectrum of cr protons , @xmath69 , by changing @xmath68 into @xmath53 in equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "this is because cr protons ( about @xmath30 ) producing most positrons do not cool and escape for snrs observed by _",
    "fermi _ and _ agile_. the solution for the secondary positrons and electrons ( equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) ) depends on only @xmath67 below @xmath29 .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath67 as the parameter to describe the system ( for example , @xmath39 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "after the cooling time of cr protons above @xmath30 ( @xmath72 ) , all crs have already cooled and we do not expect any emission .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the energy spectra of the cr protons , secondary positrons and electrons given in equations ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : fcr ] ) , where @xmath73 . for cr protons ( green line ) , the spectrum below @xmath2 is modified from the initial spectrum @xmath58 by ionization . the electron spectrum ( blue lines )",
    "is dominated by knock - on electrons below @xmath74 .",
    "a steady - state solution is obtained by changing @xmath46 to infinity in equation ( [ eq : f ] ) .",

    "primary cr electrons are negligible as long as the ratio of primary cr electrons to cr protons is @xmath79 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we calculate synchrotron emission , inverse compton emission with cmb and bremsstrahlung emission from secondary positrons and electrons @xcite , bremsstrahlung emission from cr protons @xcite , and annihilation emission from secondary positrons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "energy spectra of secondary positrons and electrons , obtained from equation ( [ eq : f ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "when positrons cool to @xmath80 , they form positroniums through charge exchange . the production rate of the positroniums , @xmath81 , is obtained by @xmath82 one fourth of positroniums decay into two @xmath6 photons .",
    "thus the photon flux of the @xmath6 line , @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the source distance .",
    "the line width of the annihilation line of positroniums emitted from molecular clouds is @xmath86 @xcite .",

    "we again note that this condition is typical for middle - aged snrs observed by gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "annihilation emission ( red line ) dominates at around the @xmath6 range .",
    "it is notable that synchrotron emission and inverse compton emission with cmb induced by secondary positrons and electrons do not contribute in the energy range of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . moreover , synchrotron emission by secondary positrons and electrons depends on the magnetic field , the maximum energy of cr protons and the spectral index of cr protons ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission of cr protons ( green line ) also depends on @xmath89 .",
    "note that bremsstrahlung emission of cr protons can be observed by the future x - ray telescope , nustar @xcite and astro - h @xcite .    for the estimation of the annihilation line , we can neglect the escape loss as long as @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , most positrons are cooled by the ionization loss as long as @xmath92 , so that the magnetic field ( @xmath93 ) , the size of molecular clouds ( @xmath94 ) and the normalization of the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath95 ) are not important .",
    "hence , the ambiguity of the annihilation line is only @xmath67 .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the flux ratio , @xmath96 , as a function of @xmath67 , where @xmath64 .",

    "we calculated annihilation emission of the positrons and other emissions .",
    "the expected flux of the annihilation line is sufficient for the future gamma - ray telescope , such as act , to detect .",
    "therefore , we propose that annihilation emission from secondary positrons is a important tool as a cr probe .",
    "moreover , synchrotron emission from secondary positrons and electrons , and bremsstrahlung emission from cr protons can be also observed by the future x - ray telescope , nustar @xcite and astro - h @xcite .    all particles with energies smaller than @xmath30 lose their energy due to ionization , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "not only the @xmath6 line but also the ionization rate is also a probe of cr nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath101 and @xmath102 lime emissions should be observed from molecular clouds if there are many crs .",
    "low energy cr protons and knock - on electrons might be measured by using atomic lines @xcite , so that atomic lines also become a probe of cr nuclei .",
    "quantitative estimations will be addressed in future work .",
    "moreover , cr nuclei can produce nuclear excitation lines by inelastic collisions and productions of unstable nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , cr compositions around snrs can be also investigated by the nuclear excitation lines .",
    "recent observations and theoretical studies for cr compositions are also remarkable @xcite    the spectra of secondary positrons and electrons produced by cr protons are different from a single power law because of their cooling and injection spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spectra of secondary positrons and electrons below @xmath2 would become harder than the cr proton spectrum around @xmath30 .",
    "the number of secondary positrons and electrons can be larger than that of primary cr electrons when the snr age is larger than about 10 percent of the cooling time of cr protons due to the inelastic collision . even when the number of the primary cr electrons is larger than that of secondary positrons and electrons , the spectrum is affected by the cooling .",
    "these cooling effects of positrons and electrons might be a reason why radio spectra are different from expected from gamma - ray spectra observed by _",
    "however , the radio emission from snrs may be originated from inside the snr , but observed gamma rays may be originated from outside the snr .",
    "that is , a different component may produce the radio emission .",
    "we may have to build more detailed models to compare the theory and observed date in future .",
    "it is an interesting future work to compare between observations and the theory for individual snrs .",
