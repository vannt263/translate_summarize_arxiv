    "although vector mesons are produced copiously in @xmath11 annihilation , the resonance parameters of them are not well measured  @xcite . in the @xmath12 sector , in a study of initial - state radiation ( isr ) events of the type , @xmath13 , the babar and belle collaborations observed two clear structures near @xmath14  gev and 2.175  gev , the latter was produced dominantly via a @xmath1 intermediate state , and was dubbed the @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 was measured by the belle collaboration with its mass and width to be @xmath15  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath16  mev/@xmath5 , respectively  @xcite . for the @xmath3 , its mass and width measured by the babar collaboration",
    "are @xmath17  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath18  mev/@xmath5 , respectively , by fitting the @xmath1 cross section ; while with more luminosity , the belle experiment found that its mass and width are @xmath19  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath20  mev/@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "examining closely the fitting to the @xmath1 cross section , we found that the fitted @xmath3 resonance parameters are sensitive to the background shape .",
    "so it is necessary to give a more sophisticated estimation of the resonance parameters of the @xmath3 for a better understanding of its nature .",
    "this goal can be reached by performing a combined fit to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 cross sections measured by the babar and belle experiments since all the data are available via durham database  @xcite .    since the @xmath3 resonance is produced via isr in @xmath11 collisions , its @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath3 was firstly suspected to be an @xmath24-quark partner of the @xmath25  @xcite since both are produced in @xmath11 annihilation and exhibit similar decay patterns .",
    "on the other hand , a number of different interpretations have been proposed , which include : an @xmath26 hybrid  @xcite ; a @xmath27 @xmath12 state  @xcite with a width predicted to be in the range 120 - 210  @xmath28 ; a tetraquark state  @xcite ; a @xmath29 bound state  @xcite ; a conventional excited @xmath9 meson  @xcite ; or a structure produced by final state interactions  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the @xmath3 is a @xmath30 @xmath12 state is disfavored by the rather large predicted width ( @xmath31 )  @xcite .",
    "a review  @xcite discusses the basic problem of the large expected decay widths into two mesons , which are in contrast to experimental observations .    in this paper",
    ", we try to perform all the possible fits to the @xmath32 and @xmath22 cross sections measured by the babar and belle experiments to obtain a better knowledge of the resonance parameters of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also study the possible production of the structure at around 2.4  gev/@xmath5 in both @xmath33 and @xmath1 modes .",
    "both the babar and the belle experiments reported cross sections of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for center - of - mass energy ranges from threshold to about 3.0  gev  @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the babar data sample is 232  fb@xmath34 while that of the belle data sample is 673  fb@xmath34 , with @xmath35 of the data collected at the @xmath36 resonance ( @xmath37  gev ) , while the rest were taken off the @xmath36 peak .",
    "figure  [ cross ] shows the data , good agreement between babar and belle results is observed within errors , and the two structures ( the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are evident in @xmath38 mode , and one structure ( the @xmath3 ) is evident in @xmath22 mode .",
    "also we notice that there are clusters of events near 2.4  gev/@xmath5 in both modes .",
    "in order to obtain the resonance parameters of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we fit the @xmath33 cross section distribution using a least square method with minuit in the cern program library  @xcite . the breit - wigner ( @xmath40 )",
    "form of a signal resonance used in @xmath41 analysis is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of the resonance , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the total width and partial width to @xmath11 respectively , @xmath46 is the branching fraction of @xmath47 decays into final state @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the three - body decay phase space factor .",
    "we fit the belle data on @xmath50 between threshold and 3.0  gev ( 61 data points ) and the babar data in the similar energy range ( 56 data points ) simultaneously .",
    "since the @xmath2 decays into @xmath33 while the @xmath3 decays dominantly into @xmath1 , we use two incoherent @xmath40 functions in the fit first , one for the @xmath2 and the other for the @xmath3 .",
    "the fit result is shown in fig .",
    "[ phipp - nocoh](a ) , with a goodness - of - the - fit of @xmath51 , corresponding to a confidence level ( c.l . ) of 0.03% .",
    "the statistical significance of each resonance is greater than 10@xmath52 . from the fit",
    "we obtain the following resonance parameters of the @xmath2 : @xmath53  mev/@xmath5 , @xmath54  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath55 , while those of the @xmath3 are @xmath56  mev/@xmath5 , @xmath57  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath58 , where the errors are statistical only .",
    "a fit with an additional nonresonant component does not improve the fit quality , and the contribution of the nonresonant term is negligibly small and can be neglected .",
    "since there are some events accumulating at about 2.4  gev , we also perform a fit with an additional incoherent @xmath40 function for this structure",
    ". the fitted parameters of this structure are @xmath59  mev/@xmath5 , @xmath60  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath61 with a goodness - of - the - fit of @xmath62 , corresponding to a c.l . of 0.05% .",
    "the statistical significance of the structure is @xmath63 as determined from the change in the @xmath64 value compared to the two - incoherent - resonance fit and the difference in the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the fitted values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonance parameters only change a little compared to the two - incoherent - resonance fit , and the difference is quoted as one source of systematic errors .",
    "the fit result is shown in fig .",
    "[ phipp - nocoh](b ) .",
    "we also fit with two coherent @xmath40 functions .",
    "figure  [ phipp - twocoh ] shows the fit results .",
    "there are two solutions with equally good fit quality , with a goodness - of - the - fit of @xmath65 , corresponding to a c.l .",
    "the masses and the widths of the two resonances are identical but the partial widths to @xmath11 and relative phases are different in these two solutions , as shown in table  [ phipp - twosolution ] .",
    "the resonance parameters of the @xmath2 are @xmath66  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath67  mev/@xmath5 , and those of the @xmath3 are @xmath68  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath69  mev/@xmath5 .",
    ".fit results to the combined babar and belle data on @xmath0 with two coherent @xmath40 functions .",
    "the errors are statistical only .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath70 are the mass ( in  mev/@xmath5 ) , total width ( in  mev/@xmath5 ) , and product of the branching fraction to @xmath71 and the @xmath11 partial width ( in  ev/@xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the relative phase ( in degree ) . [",

    "in summary , we present a fit to the cross sections for @xmath72 and @xmath73 from threshold to @xmath74  gev measured by babar and belle experiments . the masses ,",
    "widths and the products of the branching fraction and the @xmath11 partial width of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are determined , as listed in table  [ sum ] . from the table",
    ", we could see that the differences in the @xmath2 resonance parameters between two - incoherent-@xmath40 fit and two - coherent-@xmath40 fit to @xmath50 are not large .",
    "we take a simple average as the central value and enlarge the errors to cover all the possibilities .",
    "however , the differences in the @xmath3 resonance parameters from different fit are very large due to the assumption on the background shape and multi - solution problem , especially for the value of the product of the branching fraction and the @xmath11 partial width , we only give @xmath3 mass and width here .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath75  mev/@xmath5 , @xmath76  mev/@xmath5 and @xmath77  ev/@xmath5 , and @xmath78  mev/@xmath5 , @xmath79  mev/@xmath5 . here",
    "the uncertainties include both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "we find that the central value of the @xmath3 width is larger than the babar measurement .",
    "however it is consistent with the predicted values with the assumptions that the @xmath3 is an @xmath26 hybrid  @xcite or a @xmath27 @xmath12 state  @xcite .",
    "the widths of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are quite similar and both are at the 200  mev/@xmath5 level .",
    "this may suggest that the @xmath3 be an excited @xmath9 state .",
    "although there is faint evidence of the structure at around 2.4  gev/@xmath5 in @xmath0 and @xmath80 in both babar and belle data , the statistical significance is smaller than 3.0@xmath52 .",
