    "there is now a consensus that , in well - ionized accretion disks , magnetorotational instabilities ( mri ) create turbulence that provides the ` anomalous viscosity ' required to drive accretion @xcite .",
    "this removes a major uncertainty that afflicted previous theoretical models for black hole accretion , and opens the possibility of using numerical simulations to study directly the structure and variability of the accretion flow .",
    "questions that we might hope to address include :    * the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of the flow as it crosses @xmath1 , the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "recent work has suggested that mhd effects interior to @xmath1 ( in the ` plunging ' region ) could invalidate existing models of black hole accretion , with consequences that include an increase in the predicted radiative efficiency of thin disk accretion @xcite .",
    "this suggestion remains controversial @xcite .",
    "* the predicted variability in emission from the inner disk . * the structure of the disk magnetic field and the rate of transport of magnetic flux through @xmath1 , which together determine the efficiency of the blandford - znajek mechanism for extracting spin energy of the black hole @xcite .",
    "this article presents results from simplified mhd simulations@xcite of black hole accretion that focus on the first of these questions .",
    "we outline the numerical approach , and discuss our results and how they compare with those of other groups @xcite . our conclusion from work to date",
    "is that mhd effects in the plunging region _ can _ have an important influence on the dynamics of the inner disk flow , provided that the magnetic fields in the disk are already moderately strong .",
    "ideally , we would like to simulate a large volume of disk ( to allow for global effects@xcite and ease worries about treatment of the boundaries ) , for a long time period ( to average out fluctuations ) , at high resolution ( to resolve the most unstable scales of the magnetorotational instability ) , with the most realistic physics possible .",
    "unfortunately , we ca nt , so compromises are needed .",
    "our approach has been to simulate the simplest disk model that we believe includes the essential physical effects , while aiming for the highest resolution near and inside the last stable orbit .",
    ".summary of the simulations discussed in this article .",
    "all runs have the same sound speed , @xmath4 ( evaluated at @xmath1 ) , spatial domain @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and resolution @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the time units are such that the orbital period at the last stable orbit is @xmath11 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     we use the zeus mhd code @xcite to solve the equations of ideal mhd within a restricted ` wedge ' of disk in cylindrical @xmath12 geometry .",
    "the equation of state is isothermal , and a paczynski - wiita potential @xcite is used to model the effect of a last stable orbit within the newtonian hydrocode . to further simplify the problem",
    ", we ignore the vertical component of gravity and consider an unstratified disk model .",
    "the boundary conditions are set to outflow at the radial boundaries , are periodic in azimuth , and are either periodic or reflecting in @xmath13 .",
    "the simulations begin with a stable , approximately gaussian surface density profile outside @xmath1 , which is threaded with a weak magnetic field .",
    "this initial seed field has a constant ratio of thermal to magnetic energy @xmath14 , and is either vertical or azimuthal .",
    "we evolve this setup , which is immediately unstable to the mri , until a significant fraction of the mass has been accreted , and plot results from timeslices towards the end of the runs when the magnetic fields have reached a saturated state .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the parameters of three simulations , which are improved versions of those previously reported @xcite .",
    "the simulated disks are ` thin ' in the sense that pressure gradients are negligibly small in the disk outside @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the ratio of sound speed to orbital velocity , which in a stratified disk is approximately equal to @xmath15 , is @xmath16 at the last stable orbit .",
    "we have not ( yet ) attempted the more difficult task of simulating very thin disks , which have longer viscous timescales , and caution against extrapolating our conclusions into that regime .    following a suggestion by charles gammie ( personal communication ) , we investigated whether varying the magnetic field strength in the _ disk _ ( i.e. at @xmath17 ) led to changes in the dynamics of the flow within the plunging region . to vary the field strength in the simulations , we make use of the fact that the saturation level of the mri can be altered by varying the net flux of seed fields in the initial conditions .",
    "local simulations@xcite show that the resultant shakura - sunyaev @xmath18 parameter@xcite is approximately , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the alfven speeds for initial conditions with uniform vertical and azimuthal seed fields , and @xmath22 is the sound speed . for our simulations , we find that the range of initial conditions ( and vertical boundary conditions ) shown in table [ table1 ] leads to a variation in @xmath18 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the disk .    of course , this is a numerical trick .",
    "the _ true _ value of @xmath18 in the disk immediately outside @xmath1 will probably depend upon details of the disk physics ( for example , the relative importance of gas and radiation pressure ) , and may vary with time .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the geometry of the simulations .",
    "all mhd disk simulations look broadly similar , and these are no exception . we obtain a pattern of surface density fluctuations that are strongly sheared by the differential rotation , and disk magnetic fields that are predominantly azimuthal .",
    "a map of the ratio of magnetic to thermal energy , also shown in the figure , displays clearly the predicted increase@xcite in the relative importance of magnetic fields near and interior to the marginally stable orbit . determining the influence of these fields upon the dynamics of the flow in the inner disk and in the plunging region is the main goal of the calculations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the magnetic torque as a function of radius in the three simulations , expressed as the magnetic contribution to the equivalent shakura - sunyaev @xmath18 parameter , @xmath25 there are also hydrodynamic ( reynolds ) stresses , which are somewhat harder to measure@xcite , but which are found to be substantially smaller than the magnetic stresses in local simulations .",
    "the three choices for the initial flux and vertical boundary conditions lead to large variations in the saturation level of the mri and associated @xmath26 .",
    "the run with an initially azimuthal field produces an @xmath27 , while the run with a relatively strong initial vertical flux leads to a disk @xmath26 that exceeds 0.1 .",
    "this increase is qualitatively in agreement with local simulations@xcite . for the run with the strongest field ,",
    "the magnetic field energy density in the disk near @xmath1 is on average near equipartition with the thermal energy @xmath28 .",
    "there are large fluctuations with time , however , including brief periods where the magnetic energy substantially exceeds the thermal energy . in all runs , the relative importance of magnetic fields compared to the thermal energy increases within @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows how the torques influence the dynamics of the flow .",
    "we plot the specific angular momentum of the flow @xmath29 as a function of radius .",
    "hydrodynamic models for thin disk accretion onto black holes obtain @xmath30 within the last stable orbit , corresponding to a zero - torque boundary condition for the disk@xcite",
    ". a non - zero @xmath31 implies transport of angular momentum ( and implicitly energy ) into the disk from within the plunging region .",
    "we find that @xmath31 in the plunging region correlates with @xmath26 in the disk .",
    "weak disk fields lead to a small ( but significant ) decline in @xmath29 within the last stable orbit , while strong fields lead to a steeply declining specific angular momentum profile at small radii .",
    "the former behavior is similar to that seen in our earlier simulations@xcite ( which also had rather weak fields ) , while the latter is comparable to the results obtained by hawley@xcite and hawley and krolik@xcite .",
    "their global simulations , which are substantially more ambitious than ours in terms of the included physics and spatial domain , did indeed generate relatively strong magnetic fields .",
    "the limitations of the current simulations are myriad and obvious .",
    "we are accutely aware that effects in the disk corona could be important@xcite , and that there is more to general relativity than a pseudo - newtonian potential@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that some conclusions can be drawn from existing work :    * unstratified global simulations confirm that magnetic torques persist within the last stable orbit , but suggest that if @xmath3 their influence on the dynamics of the flow is relatively modest@xcite . by modest we mean that the gradient of the specific angular momentum , @xmath31 , is non - zero but small at and inside @xmath1 . if these simulations reflect reality , existing models of black hole accretion would be a pretty good approximation for thin disks@xcite . *",
    "a gross violation of the zero - torque boundary condition at @xmath1 is also possible@xcite .",
    "this would increase the radiative efficiency of thin disk accretion above the usual @xmath32 , and have other consequences@xcite .",
    "we believe that these strong effects _ only occur _ if @xmath2 in the disk",
    ". this would be consistent with existing simulations@xcite , and with the results presented here .    for observations",
    ", these results suggest that the radiative efficiency of thin disk accretion may vary , both between systems , and in an individual system if the magnetic field strength in the disk varies with time .",
