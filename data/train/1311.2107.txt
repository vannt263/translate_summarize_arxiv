    "the phenomenon of bound - states in continuum ( bic ) was first discovered by wigner and von neumann @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies can be found in a number of papers ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "an experimental report showed evidence of bic in super - lattice structures of quantum wells with a single impurity site @xcite or in single defect tube @xcite .",
    "examples of bic in a double - cavity , 2-dimensional ( 2d ) electron waveguide was reported in @xcite-@xcite .    in general",
    "if a discrete state embeds inside the continuum , the state will become unstable due to the resonance effect .",
    "if the transition channels are more than one , the resonance line - shape becomes asymmetric due to the quantum interference between those decay channels .",
    "the phenomenon often refereed as the fano interference @xcite .",
    "there are many studies that have followed fano s work .",
    "however , the phenomena of the bic and the fano interference have been often studied as individual effects . in this paper",
    "we discuss the relation between bic and fano interference .    as an example",
    ", we consider here a tight - binding model with two _ intra - atoms _ attached to a semiconductor nanowire under a constant irradiation of an intense monochromatic radiation field .",
    "an electron of an _ intra - atom _ is excited by the radiation field from a lower energy state to an intermediate energy state to states with a continuous range of energies ; alternatively , the electron from the lower energy state can jump directly to the continuous states .",
    "we label these two optical transition paths as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "since there are two optical transition channels , fano interference appears in this model        the main results that we present in this paper are twofold : the first one is a new type of bic in this system . in this bic ,",
    "the energy of the bound state depends on the coupling constant @xmath2 of the interaction between the discrete state and the continuum .",
    "this is not the case of ordinary bic that has been discussed before ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the ordinary bic can be found for special values of energy of the discrete state that are imbedded in the continuum , where the energy shift of the discrete state due to the interaction vanishes .",
    "this value of the energy may found by requiring that the so - called self - energy partof the discrete state vanishes .",
    "hence , this type of bic has the same energy as the unperturbed energy without the interaction .",
    "we found this type of bic in our model .",
    "in addition , however , we found the new type of bic as mentioned above .",
    "since this new type of bic depends on the interaction , we call this a dynamic bic , while we call the ordinary type of bic a static bic .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the static bic is due to a geometrical interference in the wire between electron wave functions emitted by impurities .",
    "in contrast , the dynamic bic appears because of the multichannels of the transition , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as we shall show .",
    "hence , the dynamic bic is the result of fano interference .",
    "the second main result is that because the freedom to chose the frequency of the radiation field , both bic ( the dynamic bic and static bic ) may exist for wide value of the spectrum of the discrete state . this is not the case of the bic that has been discussed in @xcite for the system without the radiation field .",
    "indeed , in the absence of the radiation field , we have shown in @xcite that the bic may exist only for a special value of the discrete energy .",
    "in contrast , here one can tune the frequency of the radiation field in order to achieve the bic for arbitrary value of the energy of the discrete state .",
    "this tune - ability makes the bic phenomena much more feasible to observe experimentally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the model",
    ". then , we decompose the hamiltonian of the system into the symmetric part and anti - symmetric part so that we can analyze our problem in much simpler form . in section 3",
    ", we construct the complex eigenvalue of resonance states to analyze the instability of the discrete states inside the continuum .",
    "then we find the bic by requiring that the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of the hamiltonian vanishes at the bic . in section 4",
    ", we present several cases of the dynamic bic and the static bic by plotting the imaginary part of the eigenvalue as a function of the frequency of the radiation field . in section 5 , we summarize our results .",
    "we shall consider a semiconductor nanowire with donor - acceptor impurities , e.g. 3d transition metal impurities @xcite , where the multiplet discrete levels of transition metals appear in the semiconductor band gap @xcite .",
    "an electron of a donor is excited by an optical transition and is transferred to the acceptor through a semiconductor conduction band , and the electron is dexcited by an _ intra - atomic _ transition to emit a photon ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    we show the model system of the present work in fig .",
    "the system consists of a semiconductor nanowire with donor and acceptor impurities located at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the semiconductor nanowire is described by a 1d tight - binding model with a nearest neighbor interaction @xmath7 yielding a 1d conduction band with bandwidth @xmath8 with a lattice constant of @xmath9 .",
    "we consider the lower and higher energy states of the donor ( acceptor ) impurity represented by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , respectively . in this paper",
    "we use a conventional notation `` * '' for excited states used in atomic molecular and optical physics .",
    "we consider the charge transfer between the higher energy state to the nanowire at the impurity sites of @xmath5 and @xmath6 with a coupling @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian is then represented by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are the energies of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 represents the sum over nearest neighbors , where the sum runs from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the 1d tight - binding hamiltonian is diagonalized by the wave - number representation defined by @xmath23 where under the periodic boundary condition the wave number takes the values of @xmath24 with the length of the nanowire @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath26 , and approximate it by taking the limit @xmath27 . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath28 where the `` @xmath29 '' stands for kronecker delta",
    ". we will take this limit in section 3 .    in terms of the wave number representation ,",
    "@xmath30 reads @xmath31 where the dispersion relation of an electron in the continuum is given by @xmath32 as convention _ _ we will use the summation notation over wave vector @xmath33 . in eq.([eq : hel-5 ] ) and hereafter . in this paper",
    "we will set the origin of energy at @xmath34 i.e. , @xmath35 then we have @xmath36    we also consider a monochromatic radiation field with a frequency @xmath37 which is close to the transition energies of @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the radiation field is described by @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator for the radiation field .    as for the interaction of the electron with the radiation field ,",
    "we consider two optical transition paths from the impurity lower levels .",
    "one is the _ intra - atomic _ transition in which an electron is excited from the lower impurity level to the upper impurity level .",
    "the other is the _ inter - atomic _ transition in which an electron at the lower impurity level is directly excited into the host semiconductor nanowire at the impurity site .",
    "then the interaction hamiltonian is described under the dipole approximation @xcite as @xmath43 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the transition strengths for the two optical transitions . since the monochromatic radiation @xmath44 is near resonant to the transition from the lower level to the upper level or semiconductor conduction band , we have used rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hv ] ) where we have neglected further excitation from the conduction electron to higher excited states .    even though the interactions of the electron with the radiation field , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are small , when the the radiation field intensity is large with a large value of @xmath45 , we have to incorporate the radiation field non - perturbatively in terms of the dressed state concept .",
    "we then consider the composite vector space of the electronic states and the radiation field @xcite .",
    "let us denote the number state @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) as an eigenstate of the radiation filed .",

    "as we pointed out previously , our main focus is to study the decay process under influence of a constant irradiation of an intense monochromatic optical field . for this purpose ,",
    "we solve the complex eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian .",
    "the solutions corresponding to unstable state are found on the second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane .",
    "the imaginary part gives decay rate of the unstable state .",
    "we shall solve the complex eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian : @xmath64    we start with the anti - symmetric sector , i.e. , @xmath65-sector in eq.([eq : hp ] ) .",
    "we denote the components of the eigenstates in the @xmath65-sector as @xmath66    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpsi ] ) we obtain the following system of equations ( for @xmath61 )    @xmath67    from the above relations , we obtain the eigenvalue equation for @xmath65-sector . with similar calculations , we can also obtain the eigenvalue equations for the symmetric sector , @xmath68-sector in eq.([eq : hs ] ) .",

    "note that if the last term of the equation vanishes , we obtain @xmath76 which are real solutions .",
    "one can show that these are the only real solutions of eq.([eq : disp ] ) as follows : let us denote the real eigenvalue as @xmath77 substituting it into eq.([eq : disp ] ) , we have    @xmath78\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : proof of two solutions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note the left - hand side itself and the factor in front of @xmath79 are both real , because all parameters are real .",
    "hence @xmath79 must be real , or else , the factor in front must vanish .    by the definition of bic we have @xmath80 as a result @xmath81 in eq.([eq : dis - e ] ) is real for @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , @xmath79 is a complex number with a non - vanishing imaginary part except for @xmath83 eq .",
    "( [ eq : sef ] ) leads to one possible set of the bic that satisfies @xmath84 then , this leads to eq.([eq : z ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , if eq.([eq : sef ] ) is not satisfied , then , @xmath72 is a complex number as mentioned above .",
    "hence , to be consistent which the fact that the left - hand side of eq.([eq : proof of two solutions ] ) must be real , we shall have @xmath85    hence , once again we obtain eq.([eq : z ] ) .",

    "this is a typical feature of the ordinary bic in this system , hence the static bic mentioned in the introduction comes from a geometrical interference of the two electron wavefunctions emitted from @xmath12 and @xmath13 states .    substituting eq .",

    "next we consider the case of eq .",
