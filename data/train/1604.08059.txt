    "this paper is about creative telescoping for hypergeometric terms .",
    "a  _ hypergeometric term _ is an expression  @xmath0 in , say , two variables @xmath1 such that the two shift quotients @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be expressed as rational functions in @xmath4 and  @xmath5 .",
    "the prototypical example of a hypergeometric term is the binomial coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "creative telescoping is the main tool for simplifying definite sums of hypergeometric terms .",
    "the task consists in finding some nonzero recurrence operator @xmath7 and another hypergeometric term  @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "it is required that the operator @xmath7 does not contain @xmath5 or the shift operator  @xmath10 , i.e. , it must have the form @xmath11 for some @xmath12 that only depend on  @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are as above , we say that @xmath7 is a _ telescoper _ for  @xmath0 , and @xmath8 is a _ certificate _ for  @xmath7 .",
    "once a telescoper for @xmath0 is known , we can extract useful information about definite sums such as @xmath13 from  @xmath7 .",
    "see  @xcite for further information .",
    "these references also contain classical algorithms for computing telescopers and certificates for given hypergeometric terms . during the past 25 years",
    ", the technique of creative telescoping has been generalized and refined in various ways  @xcite .",
    "the latest trend in this development are so - called reduction - based algorithms , first presented in  @xcite .",
    "one of their features is that they can find a telescoper for a given term @xmath14 without also computing the corresponding certificate .",
    "this is interesting because a certificate is not always needed , and it is typically much larger ( and thus computationally more expensive ) than the telescoper , so we may not want to compute it if we do nt have to .",
    "reduction - based algorithms have been first developed in the differential case , for various cases  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea , formulated for the shift case , is as follows .",
    "let  @xmath15 be a field of characteristic zero .",
    "suppose we know a function  @xmath16 , called _ reduction _ , with the property that for all @xmath14 in the domain under consideration , say @xmath17 , containing @xmath18 , there exists a @xmath19 in the same domain such that @xmath20 , i.e. , the difference @xmath21 is a summable term .",
    "we call @xmath22 a _ remainder _ of @xmath14 with respect to the reduction  @xmath16 . then in order to find a telescoper for  @xmath14 , we can compute @xmath23 until we find a linear dependence over the field @xmath24 .",
    "if such a dependence is found , say @xmath25 for some @xmath12 in @xmath24 , then @xmath26 is a telescoper for  @xmath14 .    in order to show that this method terminates , one possible approach is to show that the @xmath24-vector space spanned by @xmath27 for @xmath28 has a finite dimension",
    "then , as soon as @xmath29 exceeds this dimension , we can be sure that a telescoper will be found .",
    "this approach was taken in  @xcite .",
    "as a nice side result , this approach provides an independent proof of the existence of telescopers , and even a bound on their order . in the paper from last year  @xcite , the authors used a different approach .",
    "instead of showing that the remainders form a finite - dimensional vector space , they showed that for every summable term @xmath14 , we have @xmath30 .",
    "this also ensures that the method terminates ( assuming that we already know for other reasons that a telescoper exists ) , and in fact that it will find the smallest possible telescoper , but it does not provide a bound on its order .    this discrepancy in the approaches for the differential case and",
    "the shift case is unpleasant .",
    "it is not clear why the shift case should require a different argument .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that it does not .",
    "we will continue the development of last year s theory to a point where we can also show that the remainders belong to a finite - dimensional vector space . as a result",
    ", we obtain new bounds for the order of telescopers for hypergeometric terms .",
    "we obtain lower as well as upper bounds .",
    "we do not find exactly the same bounds that are already in the literature  @xcite .",
    "comparing our bounds to the known bounds , it appears that for generic  input , the values often agree ( of course , because the known bounds are already generically sharp ) .",
    "however , there are some special examples in which our bounds are better than the known bounds . on the other hand ,",
    "our bounds are never worse than the old bounds .",
    "using the same notations as in @xcite , we let @xmath31 be a field of characteristic zero , and @xmath32 be the field of rational functions in @xmath5 over @xmath31 .",

    "<S> based on a modified version of abramov - petkovek reduction , a new algorithm to compute minimal telescopers for bivariate hypergeometric terms was developed last year . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate further in this paper and present a new argument for the termination of this algorithm , which provides an independent proof of the existence of telescopers and even enables us to derive lower as well as upper bounds for the order of telescopers for hypergeometric terms . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the known bounds in the literature , our bounds are sometimes better , and never worse than the known ones .    </S>",
