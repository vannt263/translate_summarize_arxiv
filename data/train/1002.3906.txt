    "since its conception , quantum mechanics has been extensively applied to condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "this endeavour resulted in important conceptual and technological advances . in the last few decades",
    ", this scenario has gained even more strength with the born of quantum information science ( qis )  @xcite . in this",
    "context , quantum spin systems have played a central role in several applications for both quantum communication  @xcite and quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , quantum spins models describe the effective interactions in a variety of physical systems  @xcite , e.g. , quantum hall systems , high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermions , and magnetic compounds .",
    "more generally , low dimensional systems as those described by interacting spins are particularly interesting because of the presence of typically pronounced quantum fluctuations as well as the possibility of their realization by several distinct physical approaches  @xcite .",
    "a key concept in qis is the quantum correlation among parts of a composite quantum system , which is a fundamental resource for several applications in quantum information  @xcite .",
    "the existence of quantum correlations were first noted in nonseparable ( i.e. , entangled ) states .",
    "entanglement was pointed out by schrdinger  in 1935  @xcite as the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics . since then , entanglement was basically the only kind of quantum correlation theoretically and experimentally explored . however , in the past few years , it has been realized that there exist nonclassical correlations which are not captured by entanglement measures  @xcite . in general , a quantum correlation , which can be measured by the _ quantum discord _ ( qd )",
    "@xcite , often arises as a consequence of coherence between different partitions in a quantum system , being present even in separable states .",
    "recently , qd was analyzed in a number of contexts , e.g. , low dimensional spin models  @xcite , open quantum systems  @xcite , biological  @xcite , and relativistic  @xcite systems .",
    "moreover , there exist strong indications that the qd is the resource responsible for the speed up in the model of computation known as deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit  @xcite .",
    "in this article we consider pairwise qd in an infinite anisotropic xy spin-1/2 chain in the presence of an external transverse magnetic field for both zero and finite temperatures . our aim is to explore , in the thermodynamical regime",
    ", the behavior of qd for spin pairs arbitrarily distant and also take into account the effect of temperature on the behavior of correlations .",
    "such contributions , which have not been considered in previous works , will be shown to bring several new effects to the subject .",
    "in particular , as we will show , the qd for spin pairs more distant than second - neighbors is able to characterize a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "this is a remarkable behavior , since a signature of the qpt is then available even for distances where pairwise entanglement is absent .",
    "moreover , we will show that the qd may increase with both temperature and magnetic field for certain regions of parameter space .",
    "this result will extend , to the thermodynamic limit , the previous analysis for two - spin hamiltonians reported in ref .",
    "finally , we will discuss the dominance of quantum correlation over classical correlation for different limits of the xy model , showing that the qd is greater than its classical counterpart for the isotropic limit ( xx model ) , with the opposite scenario taking place for the transverse field ising model .",
    "these results generalize those of refs .",

    "the information - theoretical measure of the total correlation between the partitions of a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 is the quantum mutual information  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2tr@xmath3  is the von neumann entropy and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the reduced - density operator of the partition @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "@xcite ) .    since the system is invariant by translations , the elements of the two site reduced - density operator depends only on the distance ( @xmath41 ) between the sites .",

    "remarkably , a numerical analysis implies that the extremization is achieved , for any values of @xmath36 , @xmath38 , and @xmath49 , by the choice @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "then , the relevant measurement for the model is given by @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 denoting the up and down spins in the @xmath67 direction , namely , @xmath68 .",
    "this result generalizes the extremization obtained for the transverse field ising model at zero temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite , and allows us to write the classical correlation as @xmath69 where    @xmath70    thus the quantum correlation in state ( [ ts ] ) is simply given by    @xmath71      let us first consider the xy model at zero temperature .",
    "such a model has a quantum phase diagram displayed in fig .  1 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "[ h ]    fig1.eps    the qd for the first , second , third , and fourth nearest - neighbors in the thermal ground state ( [ ts ] ) , close to zero temperature , is displayed in fig .",
    "2 ( a)-(d ) .",
    "as expected , qd decreases as we increase the distance between the sites .",
    "however , we also see a clear difference in the amount of quantum correlation between the regions where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "although the maximum value of qd decreases as we increase the distance between the sites , the slope in the critical region gets more evident for far neighbors .",
    "the maximum increasing rate of the qd as function of @xmath38 occurs at the quantum phase transition line ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we also note that nonclassical correlation is created when the magnetic field increases .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    the derivative of the quantum discord between fourth nearest - neighbors with respect to @xmath38 is depicted in fig .",
    "so , the quantum discord between far neighbors can be used to characterize the qpt .",
    "it is important to mention that , even when entanglement is not present , the qpt can be clearly revealed through the singular behavior of qd . in fig .",
    "2 ( e ) and ( f ) we note that , for a considerable range of @xmath36 , eof is zero ( there is no entanglement ) for third and fourth nearest - neighbors . in the particular case of the transverse field ising model ( @xmath75 )",
    ", entanglement is indeed completely absent for sites farther than second nearest - neighbors  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , qd is non - null  ( where the entanglement is zero ) and its behavior reveals that , for @xmath75 and @xmath73 , we have long - range nonclassical correlation between far sites .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that the pairwise classical correlation can also be employed to detect a qpt in a very evident way . in the ising model , for example ,",
    "the first derivative of the classical correlation with respect to @xmath38 is not analytic at the critical point , while the second derivative of quantum discord presents such a nonanalicity @xcite .",
    "this behavior of the classical correlation also holds in the xy model for the whole range of values of @xmath36 considered here , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps    [ ptb ]    fig4.eps      in order to introduce finite temperature , we begin by considering the thermal state of the xx model ( @xmath76 . for this limit , we plot the thermal classical and quantum correlations for the second nearest - neighbors in fig .",
    "similar results are obtained for others than second nearest - neighbors .",
    "we note that the quantum discord is typically greater than its classical counterpart and it indeed may increase with temperature ( in a given region ) for some values of @xmath38 .",
    "it is evidenced near to the critical value @xmath74 .",
    "this result extends , to the thermodynamic limit , the previous analysis for two - spins hamiltonians reported in ref .",
    "the increasing of qd with temperature when a magnetic field is present is a consequence of the fact that , when the field is turned on , the ground state tends to be less correlated than some low - lying excited states .",
    "so the effect of the temperature is to populate such correlated excited states , leading to the net effect of an increasing of qd .",
    "naturally , this effect tends to disappear as the temperature gets too large .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of entanglement observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ h ]    fig5.eps    [ t ]    fig6.eps    let us now turn our attention to the transverse ising model ( @xmath75 ) at finite temperatures .",
    "classical correlation and qd for second nearest - neighbors are shown in fig .",
    "note that qd still increases with temperature but this effect is feeble when compared with the same behavior in xx model .",
    "we also observe that the classical correlation is typically greater than the quantum discord for any temperature .",
    "this is the opposite scenario in comparison with the xx model .",
    "remarkably , for a weak magnetic field , qd available in the xx model overcomes that of the transverse ising model .",
    "so , applications of the xy model in qis tends to offer more quantum correlation as a resource in the isotropic limit ( the xx model ) than in the ising limit .",
    "in summary , we have examined pairwise qd and its classical counterpart in the thermodynamic limit of the anisotropic xy spin-1/2 chain in the presence of an external transverse magnetic field .",
    "we have considered the system at both zero and finite temperatures , providing an analytical expression for both classical and quantum correlations for spin pairs at any distance .",
    "remarkably , we have shown that the quantum discord between far neighbors is able to characterize a qpt , even for distances where pairwise entanglement is absent .",
    "this is a consequence of the longer range of nonclassical correlation ( that is nonvanishing for a class of separable states ) in comparison with the short - range behavior of pairwise entanglement .",
    "concerning the thermal effect onto correlations , we have shown how qd can be increased with temperature as the transverse magnetic field is varied . moreover ,",
    "we have also outlined the dominance of the qd over classical correlation for the xx model in opposition to the ising limit .",
    "generalization of these results for larger subsystems and further analysis of the long - range behavior of qd for quantum critical phenomena including spontaneous symmetry breaking ( at zero temperature ) are left for a future investigation .",
