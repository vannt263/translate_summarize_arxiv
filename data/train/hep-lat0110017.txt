    "given a @xmath1-dimensional pure gauge theory undergoing a continuous deconfinement transition at the critical temperature @xmath2 , the order parameter of this transition is the polyakov loop .",
    "the @xmath3-dimensional effective model obtained by integrating out all degrees of freedom except the order parameter is globally invariant under the center of the gauge group .",
    "this effective model possesses only short - range interactions and therefore the phase transition , when continuous , is accompanied by long range fluctuations only in the order parameter  @xcite .    according to the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite , the @xmath1-dimensional gauge theory and the @xmath3-dimensional effective model ,",
    "if it also displays a second - order phase transition , belong to the same universality class .",
    "therefore , their critical properties such as critical indices , finite - size scaling , correlation functions at criticality , are predicted to coincide .",
    "the validity of the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture has been confirmed in several monte carlo analyses  @xcite .    in the present work we have considered su(3 ) in ( 2 + 1)-dimension and su(2 ) in ( 3 + 1)-dimension , which belong to the universality classes of the 3-state potts model in 2-dimension and of the z(2 ) ( ising ) model in 3-dimension , respectively .",
    "for a @xmath3-dimensional statistical model , a way to extract critical indices is to study the finite - size behavior of suitable operators .",
    "if a mapping between operators in the @xmath1-dimensional gauge theory and operators in the @xmath3-dimensional effective model is established , it is possible to exploit finite - size effects also in the gauge theory to determine its critical indices",
    ". this would provide with a new method for the computation of the critical indices of a pure gauge theory with a second order phase transition .",
    "the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture intrinsically establishes a correspondence between the polyakov loop of the gauge theory and the order parameter of the effective model .",
    "the mapping of the plaquette operator of the gauge theory with a linear combination of the identity and the energy operators of the effective model has been shown in  @xcite for su(2 ) in ( 2 + 1)-dimension , which generates as effective model the 2-dimensional ising model . in this case , the critical behavior of the effective model is known exactly , thanks to the methods of conformal field theory .",
    "this mapping between operators has allowed to study , by means of universality arguments , several non - perturbative features of gauge theories  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "the method is applied to the computation of the critical index @xmath0 of the correlation length . in the @xmath3-dimensional statistical model , the finite - size behavior of the ( lattice ) energy operator @xmath4",
    "is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lattice size , understood to be large enough , and @xmath7 is a non - universal constant .",
    "in the @xmath1-dimensional pure gauge theory , any operator @xmath8 , invariant under gauge and center symmetry is expected to scale according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the identity operator and @xmath11 the ( scaling ) energy operator of the statistical model .",
    "simple operators which satisfy the mentioned symmetry requirements are wilson loops and operators like @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the polyakov loop at the site @xmath14 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 represent different sites of the @xmath3-dimensional space .",
    "this ansatz was introduced and tested in  @xcite and used in  @xcite .",
    "* su(3 ) in ( 2 + 1)-dimension *    the lattice operators considered were the electric and magnetic plaquette and @xmath16 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 neighbor sites in the 2-dimensional spatial lattice .",
    "all these observables have the required symmetry properties and can be computed with high accuracy in monte carlo simulations .",
    "simulations were performed on lattices with temporal size @xmath17 and spatial sizes @xmath18 ranging from 7 to 30 ; @xmath19 was set at its critical value @xmath20 , taken from ref .",
    "the simulation algorithm was a mixture of one sweep of a 10-hit metropolis and four sweeps of over - relaxation consisting in two updates of ( random ) su(2 ) subgroups . for each simulation",
    "400k equilibrium configurations were collected , separated each other by 10 updating steps .",
    "the error analysis was done by the jackknife method applied to data bins at different levels of blocking .",
    "the table of numerical results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    , where @xmath0 comes from the multibranched fit .",
    "similar figure has been obtained for the polyakov loop correlator.,title=\"fig : \" ] , where @xmath0 comes from the multibranched fit .",
    "similar figure has been obtained for the polyakov loop correlator.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a single multibranched fit was performed of the three data sets , taking electric ( magnetic ) plaquettes from lattices with even ( odd ) @xmath6 , in order to avoid cross correlations .",
    "polyakov loop correlator data were measured separately and are therefore not correlated with the plaquette measurements .",
    "the result of the fit is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_su3 ] ) , to be compared with the _ exact _ value in the 2-dimensional 3-state potts model , @xmath23 .",
    "a previous monte carlo determination by the @xmath24 method in su(3 ) in ( 2 + 1)-dimension  @xcite gave @xmath25 .",
    "the lattice operators considered are the electric and magnetic plaquette .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed on lattices with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ranging from 5 to 22 , at the critical value of @xmath19 , @xmath26 , taken from ref .",
    "the simulation algorithm adopted is the over - relaxed heat - bath  @xcite and the error analysis was done as in the previous case . for each simulation",
    "we have collected so far a number of configurations ranging from 50k to 600k , according to the lattice size .",
    "the multibranched fit on the electric ( magnetic ) plaquettes taken from lattices with even ( odd ) @xmath6 has given @xmath27 , with @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ fig_su2 ] ) .",
    "this result is to be compared with the determination of @xmath0 in the 3-dimensional ising model . in this model ,",
    "the high - temperature expansion method gave the following very accurate result  @xcite : @xmath29 .",
