    "we recall from sec .",
    "[ countingmzm ] that particle - hole symmetry in class d and bdi implies that the reflection matrix @xmath43 at the fermi level has the block decomposition @xmath343 the andreev reflection eigenvalues @xmath344 $ ] are the eigenvalues of the matrix product @xmath345 .",
    "( equivalently , @xmath346 is the singular value of @xmath347 . )",
    "let us first assume that all @xmath348 s are nonzero , so that the matrix @xmath347 is invertible .",
    "unitarity @xmath349 requires that @xmath350 , hence @xmath351 is an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "we focus on the product @xmath352 with eigenvalues @xmath353 .",
    "let @xmath0 be an eigenvector of @xmath354 , so @xmath355",
    ". then @xmath356 satisfies @xmath357 the eigenvalue @xmath358 is therefore twofold degenerate if @xmath359 and @xmath0 are linearly independent .",
    "suppose they are not independent , meaning that @xmath360 for some @xmath361 , then @xmath362 hence @xmath363 .",
    "so any eigenvalue @xmath364 of @xmath354 is twofold degenerate .",
    "since we assumed from the beginning that @xmath365 , this implies that the andreev reflection eigenvalues @xmath342 are twofold degenerate .    to extend the proof to the case",
    "that @xmath347 is not invertible , we regularize the inverse and consider the matrix @xmath366 with @xmath367 a positive infinitesimal . since @xmath368 remains antisymmetric , we can follow the same steps to conclude that the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath369 are twofold degenerate .",
    "evaluation of this matrix product using the identity @xmath370 gives the expression @xmath371 which has eigenvalues @xmath372 these are either zero or twofold degenerate , hence we conclude that @xmath342 is twofold degenerate .    in the absence of time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry",
    ", only the bri degeneracy of the andreev reflection eigenvalues applies .",
    "if one or both of these symmetries are present , then all @xmath348 s are twofold degenerate  including those equal to @xmath373 or @xmath374 .",
    "kramers degeneracy then comes in the place of bri degeneracy , it is not an additional degeneracy @xcite .",
    "this is probably the reason that bri degeneracy was not noticed during half a century of studies of andreev reflection  it was hidden by kramers degeneracy .",
    "notice that bri degeneracy immediately explains the stability of an unpaired unit andreev reflection eigenvalue : it can not be displaced from unity by disorder without a partner .",
    "this is in essence why a majorana resonance in the conductance remains stable no matter how strongly the zero - mode is coupled to the continuum @xcite .",
    "a fully transmitted majorana edge mode combines zero electrical conductance with a quantized shot noise power of @xmath375 per electron volt .",
    "this result was derived by @xcite starting from general scattering formulas in the literature @xcite .",
    "because of its significance for the characterization and detection of majorana modes , we give here a self - contained derivation .",
    "the zero - frequency shot noise power is defined by the correlator @xmath376 of the time - dependent fluctuations @xmath377 of the electrical current into the grounded terminal 1 .",
    "terminal 2 is biased at voltage @xmath15 and connected to terminal 1 via the majorana edge mode , see fig .",
    "[ fig_array ] .",
    "we introduce vectors of fermion operators @xmath378 for incoming and outgoing quasiparticles , labeled by the terminal number 1,2 and electron - hole degree of freedom @xmath379 .",
    "incoming and outgoing operators are related by the scattering matrix , @xmath380 composed out of reflection and transmission blocks @xmath381 .",
    "the pauli matrix @xmath382 acts on the electron - hole degree of freedom .",
    "( the spin degree of freedom plays no role here . )",
    "since we will be restricting ourselves to the linear response limit @xmath259 , we can evaluate the scattering matrix at the fermi level @xmath10 ( and will omit the energy argument of @xmath209 in what follows ) .",
    "the current operator at terminal @xmath374 is given by @xmath383 the projector @xmath384 projects onto terminal 1 and the pauli matrix @xmath255 accounts for the opposite charge of electrons and holes .",

    "in the zero - temperature limit we need to consider only energies in the interval @xmath389 , where @xmath390 the term @xmath391 in the definition of @xmath392 ensures that terminal 2 injects electrons and not holes ( assuming @xmath393 ) .    the equilibrium expectation value that we need is given by @xmath394 so we arrive at the shot noise power @xmath395 using that @xmath396 , this evaluates to @xmath397 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad={\\rm tr}\\,(t_{ee}^\\dagger t_{ee}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+t_{he}^\\dagger t_{he}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}})-{\\rm tr}\\,(t_{ee}^\\dagger t_{ee}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}-t_{he}^\\dagger t_{he}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}})^2.\\label{pshotresultapp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have defined @xmath398 , the shot noise quantum of @xmath399 per electron volt .",
    "so far we have not yet used that terminals 1 and 2 are connected by an unpaired majorana mode . to account for that , it is convenient to switch from the electron - hole representation to the majorana representation , by means of the unitary transformation @xmath400 the particle - hole symmetry relation implies that @xmath401 is a real orthogonal matrix at the fermi level .",
    "the pauli matrix @xmath255 transforms into @xmath402 , so that the shot noise expression becomes @xmath403 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,{\\rm tr}\\,t_{\\rm m}^{\\rm t } t_{\\rm m}-\\tfrac{1}{4}\\,{\\rm tr}\\,[(1+\\tau_y)t_{\\rm m}^{\\rm t}\\tau_y t_{\\rm m}]^2.\\label{pmajoranaapp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the trace of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath404 vanishes . )",
    "the transmission matrix for an unpaired majorana mode has rank 1 , meaning that @xmath405 has only 1 nonzero singular value .",

    "the matrix @xmath409 vanishes identically , because it is proportional to the diagonal element of an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "the shot noise power thus reduces to @xmath410 in the absence of backscattering , @xmath411 , the shot noise power of the majorana edge mode equals @xmath412 .    99 abanin , d. a. , and l. s. levitov , 2007 , science * 317 * , 641 .",
