    "one of the most interesting systems currently under study is that of fermions with interactions fine - tuned to unitarity  @xcite .",
    "this system is interesting due to the absence of any scale parameter other than the density .",
    "the system is strongly interacting and thus presents a challenge for many - body methods .",
    "recently , these systems have been probed with high - frequency or short - wavelength external probes . by bombarding the fermions with radio - frequency ( rf ) radiation , which causes a transition from one atomic state to another , one can probe the structure of the unitary fermi gas .",
    "previous investigations  @xcite have shown that the high frequency tail of the rf line shape is related to the contact parameter , first introduced by shina tan  @xcite .    in this paper , we address two problems .",
    "the first one concerns the dynamic structure factor @xmath0 .",
    "this factor , in principle , can be measured by bragg scatterings  @xcite . at the fermi momentum and energy scales ,",
    "the dynamic structure function depends on the complicated many - body physics of the unitary fermi gas . for much larger @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the picture becomes simpler .",
    "there is a dominant coherent peak in the response function at @xmath3 . far away from this peak ,",
    "the strength of the dynamic structure factor should be proportional to tan s parameter , the same parameter that characterizes the rf tail .",
    "it is easy to understand why this is true : in order to absorb an external `` virtual photon '' carrying large energy and momentum and far away from the coherent peak , the photon has to hit a particle when it is near a second particle , so that it can give its momentum and energy to both .",
    "the absorption rate , therefore , depends on the probability of finding two particles at short distance from each other  which is characterized by tan s contact parameter .",
    "the problem of the dynamic structure factor is more complicated than that of the rf response . in particular ,",
    "care should be taken to not violate conservation laws . in this paper",
    "we use the operator product expansion ( ope ) to facilitate the calculation .",
    "the operator product expansion , introduced by wilson , is a standard method of quantum field theory .",
    "the use of the ope for cold atoms was pioneered by braaten and platter  @xcite .",
    "the end result for the dynamic structure factor is eq .",
    "( [ dsf ] ) .",
    "the second problem considered in this paper is the calculation of the energy deposition into a unitary fermi gas by small , rapid variations of the inverse scattering length .",
    "it can be solved using the same ope methods .",
    "the usefulness of the operator product expansion can be illustrated as follows .",
    "suppose we need to compute the following green s function @xmath4 for large @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "here `` large '' means energy and momentum much larger than the typical energy and momentum scales of the state with respect to which the average @xmath5 is taken . for the ground state of a unitary fermi gas , these scales are the fermi energy and fermi momentum .",
    "let us also recall that one can associate a local operator @xmath6 with a scaling dimension @xmath7 . in our counting scheme ,",
    "the dimension of momentum is 1 and of energy is 2 ( the particle mass @xmath8 is set to 1 ) . assuming that the operator product expansion exists",
    ", one can expand the product @xmath9 in terms of local operators , @xmath10 here @xmath11 are functions of one variable @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the dimensions of @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast to the ope in relativistically invariant theories , in nonrelativistic theories the ope coefficients are not constant , but are in general functions of this variable . this identity is to be interpreted as an operator identity ; in particular , we can take the expectation value of both sides with respect to any state , including thermodynamic states .",
    "taking the average and performing a fourier transform , one finds @xmath15 on the right hand side , the higher the dimension of @xmath14 , the more rapidly its contribution decays in the limit of large momentum / energy ( to be precise , the limit considered in this paper will be @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 . ) thus , the leading behavior of the green function is dominated by those few operators in the ope with smallest scaling dimension .",
    "the expectation values of the operators @xmath14 , are , in general , not computable theoretically because they depend on many - body physics .",
    "thus , they should be considered as numbers parameterizing the many - body state .",
    "the ope coefficients @xmath19 , however , depend only on few - body physics ( although , the number of bodies increases with increasing complexity of the operator @xmath14 ) , and hence can be computed reliably , at least for simple operators @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath14 . in this way , the functional dependence of @xmath22 on frequency and wavenumber can be expressed in terms of a few numbers which have to be determined experimentally or numerically .",
    "we now discuss the operators of lowest dimension .",
    "the unitary fermions are described by the lagrangian @xmath23 we set the fermion mass to one . the indices",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 refer to the two spin polarizations .",
    "if one integrates out @xmath26 , the saddle point for this field is at @xmath27 .",
    "this lagrangian is therefore equivalent to that with a four - fermi interaction @xmath28 .",
    "we will use dimensional regularization , where setting @xmath29 corresponds to fine - tuning the interaction to infinite scattering length .",
    "the propagator of the @xmath26 field is completely determined by its self - energy , and is equal to @xmath30    let us discuss the operators which may have nonzero expectation value in a unitary fermi gas . for our applications , we will need to consider only operators which do not carry particle numbers .",
    "moreover , we assume the ground state to be isotropic , so we need to look only at operators with vanishing orbital angular momentum .",
    "the following two operators have the lowest dimensions : @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 .",
    "the operators @xmath34 are the particle number densities and have dimension 3 .",
    "the operator @xmath33 has dimension equal to 4 .",
    "this can be seen by computing the dimension of @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ scalar - prop ] ) . an alternative way to find",
    "the dimension of @xmath26 is to use the operator - state correspondence , according to which the dimension of @xmath26 is the ground state energy of a system of one spin - up and one spin - down particle in a harmonic trap with unit oscillator frequency .",
    "this ground state energy is 2 .",
    "as we shall see , the expectation value @xmath35 can be identified with tan s contact parameter .",
    "together , these two operators dominate the high - momentum behavior of correlation functions , including the dynamic structure factor .",
    "to establish the relationship between @xmath35 and tan s contact parameter , let us apply the method of the ope to the one - particle green s function @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes time ordering . at the end",
    "we will be interested only in the case of @xmath38 , where the green s function is @xmath39 , but the feynman diagrams are readily available for the time - ordered green s function .    according to the previous discussion , we can write @xmath40 ( we shall see why there is no @xmath41 term below . )    to compute @xmath42 , we use the feynman diagram in fig .",

    "the energy and momentum of the particles in the medium can be neglected compared to @xmath43 .",
    "the `` hard '' particle interacts with particles of type 2 in the medium with the result , @xmath44 one can see immediately that @xmath45 has singularities only in the lower - half plane , and thus does not contribute to the green s function for @xmath38 .",
    "this can already be seen from the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : cn_fermionprop ] : one can go directly from the initial point to the final point , following the direction of the propagators ( fermions and scalars ) .",
    "recall that the propagators are all retarded .",
    "consider now the ope coefficient of @xmath46 .",
    "it can be found by computing the fermion propagator in the background field of @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig : ferm - prop - others ] , one can go from one end of the diagram to the other by following the arrows , which is not true in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : ferm - prop ] .",

    ", we find the tail of the distribution function to be @xmath51 which allows us to establish @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is tan s contact parameter  @xcite .",
