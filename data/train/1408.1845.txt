    "spontaneous confinement transitions occurring in magnetically confined plasmas are vital for the development of fusion as a viable future energy source .",
    "it is generally assumed that zonal flows are an essential ingredient for understanding these transitions  @xcite .",
    "these flows can be generated spontaneously from turbulence via reynolds stress  @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental identification of zonal flows is a hard problem .",
    "zonal flows are low - frequency phenomena with a global character , i.e. , with long wavelengths in the toroidal and poloidal directions  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , they are associated with a potential perturbation with toroidal mode number @xmath0 , poloidal mode number @xmath1 and finite radial wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "the detection of these flows has been difficult , partly due to the fact that fusion - grade plasmas are characterized by the presence of many instabilities and waves , making it hard to isolate the low - frequency , long - wavelength zonal flow in the data , containing other fluctuating and/or oscillating contributions  @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been used , including the measurement of spectra and ( long - range ) correlation  @xcite , the hilbert - huang transform  @xcite , bicoherence  @xcite and non - linear energy transfer  @xcite .",
    "the fact that zonal flows are ` global ' in the sense that they are long - wavelength phenomena should facilitate their unambiguous detection provided simultaneous measurements at several remote points inside the plasma are available , at the ( radial ) location where the zonal flow exists .    given such multipoint data ,",
    "a technique is needed to isolate and extract the ` global ' component from the fluctuation data .",
    "this task is ideally suited for the biorthogonal decomposition ( bod )  @xcite , also known as proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) or singular value decomposition ( svd ) , among others  @xcite .",
    "however , there may be other global oscillations affecting the fluctuation data , different from zonal flows .",
    "therefore , in the present work , the bod technique is complemented with additional techniques to quantify the long - range character of the biorthogonal modes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or their propagating nature , thus facilitating the distinction between global modes associated with magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) activity or other oscillations , on the one hand , and proper zonal flows , on the other .",
    "the details of the biorthogonal decomposition are well - known , and the reader is referred to the references for detailed information  @xcite . here",
    ", we will summarize its main features .",
    "the multipoint measurements constitute a data matrix @xmath3 , where the index @xmath4 labels the time and @xmath5 the detector . typically , the time corresponding to the time index , @xmath6 , is equally spaced , since measurements are typically taken at a fixed sampling rate , although this is not strictly necessary .",
    "the physical location of the detectors , @xmath7 , however , is often dictated by practical convenience or space limitations and will not necessarily correspond to a regular grid .",
    "finally , to facilitate the physical interpretation of the results , the measurements @xmath8 performed at the various detectors @xmath9 should ideally be of the same physical quantity ( in our case , an electric potential ) and be given in the same units .",
    "the bod method decomposes the data matrix @xmath3 as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a ` chrono ' ( a temporal function ) and @xmath12 a ` topo ' ( a spatial or detector - dependent function ) , such that the chronos and topos satisfy the following orthogonality relation  @xcite : @xmath13 an alternative normalization ( indicated by the superscript @xmath14 ) is @xmath15 such that the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of the topos and chronos equals 1 . in this case , @xmath16 with @xmath17 . with this normalization , the number @xmath18 represents the contribution of mode @xmath19 to the total rms ` fluctuation amplitude '",
    "thus , the fractional contribution of a given mode @xmath19 to the total ` fluctuation energy ' ( proportional to the square of the rms ) can be computed from @xmath20 the superscript ` @xmath14 ' is irrelevant in this expression .",
    "the combination chrono / topo at a given @xmath19 , @xmath21 , is called a spatio - temporal ` mode ' of the fluctuating system , and is constructed from the data matrix without any prejudice regarding the mode shape .",
    "the decomposition is performed by computing the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the data matrix @xmath3 .",
    "note that this is always possible for any real - valued rectangular matrix @xmath8 , and standard software packages are available for this purpose .",
    "the @xmath22 are the eigenvalues ( sorted in decreasing order ) , where @xmath23 .",
    "a threshold may be set for cutting off the expansion in bod modes ( based on , e.g. , a noise level ) and so keeping only the dominant contribution of modes to the data matrix for further analysis and ignoring noisy or minor contributions .",
    "when the bod expansion is cut off at a certain mode @xmath24 , the reconstructed data , @xmath25 , are defined by eq .",
    "( [ biortho ] ) while restricting the sum to @xmath26 . in this case",
    ", the reconstructed data @xmath25 minimize the least squares error with respect to the actual data @xmath8 among all possible sets of @xmath24 spatiotemporal modes .",
    "if the physical system under study contains normal mode oscillations and is sufficiently well - sampled ( spatially and temporally ) , the probability that the bod modes correspond closely to the said normal modes is high ; the bod is particularly sensitive to resonant linear normal modes  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bod technique is perhaps less suited for the analysis of non - linear systems in which no normal modes exist , as the bod modes are unlikely to correspond to any meaningful physical modes in this case .",
    "an advantage of the bod analysis is that no _ a priori _ assumption is made regarding the mode shape or spectral properties , unlike standard analysis techniques such as fourier decomposition .",
    "this has the mentioned advantage that the bod modes concentrate a maximum of fluctuation power in the lowest modes , but the disadvantage that the modes are not guaranteed to coincide exactly with the normal modes of the system ( if known ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the svd decomposition is not unique .",
    "first , the sign of the chrono and topo of a given mode @xmath19 can trivially be inverted without affecting their product , i.e. , without affecting the reconstruction according to eq .",
    "( [ biortho ] ) .",
    "second , if two svd modes @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the same eigenvalues , a rotation in the two - dimensional vector space spanned up by the chronos @xmath27 and @xmath28 and a compensating rotation in the space spanned up by the corresponding topos can be defined so that the reconstructed data , according to eq .",
    "( [ biortho ] ) , are unchanged , giving rise to a ( rotational ) indeterminacy . as will be clarified below",
    ", this may occur in the case of propagating modes .",
    "as such , it does not imply a great disadvantage , since such modes will be considered pairwise anyway .",
    "the covariance between a signal @xmath29 and a signal @xmath30 ( @xmath31 being the temporal and @xmath9 the spatial index ) is defined as : @xmath32 since the signals are expanded according to eq .",
    "( [ biortho ] ) , this expression can be simplified , using eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , to : @xmath33 i.e. , the covariance between two signals is simply the sum of the products of the corresponding topos , weighed by the square of the eigenvalues . in other words ,",
    "the topos reflect the covariance between the measurement signals ; and the contribution of each mode @xmath19 to the covariance @xmath34 is simply @xmath35 .    from eq .",
    "( [ covariance_topos ] ) one immediately obtains , again using eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) : @xmath36 thus , the topos @xmath12 are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix @xmath37 , and @xmath38 the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "this suggests that the topos @xmath12 and eigenvalues @xmath39 can be found by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix @xmath37 , after which the corresponding chronos @xmath11 can be obtained by simple matrix multiplication  @xcite : @xmath40 this view of the bod mode decomposition may be helpful when interpreting the meaning of the bod modes .",
    "the fact that the topos are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix immediately suggests an alternative approach : instead of analyzing the raw data @xmath3 , one could first normalize the data to their rms value @xmath41 when computing the svd of @xmath42 instead of @xmath3 , the resulting topos @xmath12 will then be the eigenvectors of the _ correlation _ matrix @xmath43 .      by definition ,",
    "the correlation between measurements @xmath44 and @xmath45 is obtained by normalizing the covariance , eq .",
    "( [ covariance ] ) , to the rms of each signal : @xmath46 from eq .",
    "( [ covariance_topos ] ) , it is clear that this quantity only depends on the eigenvalues and the topos .",
    "the contribution of a given mode @xmath19 to the correlation is ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath47    thus , it is possible to quantify the contribution of a specific bod mode @xmath19 to the so - called _ long range correlation _ ( lrc ) . to achieve this ,",
    "assume we may subdivide the set of measurements @xmath48 into two complementary sets : @xmath49 , with @xmath50 elements , and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 elements , such that measurements in set @xmath53 are taken at a remote location from measurements in set @xmath54 .",
    "the long range correlation is then defined as the correlation between any pair of measurements taken at remote locations .",
    "we define the contribution to the _ mean _ long range correlation of a given mode @xmath19 by averaging the correlation due to this mode among any two remote measurement points : @xmath55 this definition may lead to low values in the case of partial cancellations due to the existence of a mixture of correlations and anti - correlations between individual measurements .",
    "to measure the overall correlation ` intensity ' regardless of sign , we also define the mean absolute long range correlation : @xmath56      one important aspect of the bod method is that it assumes that all modes are separable in space and time .",
    "standing waves are of this type .",
    "however , one often has to contend with propagating structures , such as running waves .",
    "it is important to be able to recognize and distinguish these different structures .",
    "a typical example of a running wave is @xmath57 .",
    "this can trivially be decomposed into a sum of two standing wave patterns : @xmath58 by fourier s theorem , this result can be generalized to any linearly propagating spatiotemporal structure of argument @xmath59 .",
    "thus , linearly propagating or ` traveling ' waves or structures generate a pair of bod modes , with similar eigenvalues and a mutual phase difference ( in space and time ) of around 90@xmath60  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a method is needed to identify such mode pairs .",
    "if the propagating mode has a clearly defined frequency @xmath61 , the fourier power spectra @xmath62 of the concerned chronos will have a peak at this frequency ( here , the circumflex indicates the fourier transform ) , and the cross phase between the chronos @xmath63 is easily determined as the phase of the complex cross spectrum @xmath64 at the frequency @xmath61 , where the star signifies complex conjugate .    as the low - frequency modes of interest",
    "do not always have a clearly defined spectral peak , we will use a technique for quadrature detection based on the hilbert transform  @xcite . in this framework",
    ", we must assume that the bod topos and chronos fluctuate symmetrically about zero , which can be achieved by subtracting their mean or applying a suitable high - pass frequency filter prior to analysis .",
    "this is necessary as it is a well - known fact that the hilbert transform does not produce a reasonable estimate of the quadrature if the mean of the signal is not zero or is drifting  @xcite . with this additional assumption , it is feasible to compute the quadrature of a given topo or chrono by means of the hilbert transform .",
    "thus , we can use the full set of topos and chronos and compute the following spatial and temporal quadrature matrices : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hilbert transform and the tilde refers to the removal of the mean ( or lowest frequencies ) mentioned above .",
    "the elements of these quadrature matrices are restricted to the range @xmath67 $ ] ; the absolute value of a given element @xmath68 will differ significantly from 0 when the corresponding modes are in approximate quadrature . by means of this technique ,",
    "it becomes possible to identify linearly propagating structures by finding pairs of modes with similar eigenvalues , @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are significantly different from zero . by default , modes that do not occur in pairs",
    "then correspond to standing wave structures .",
    "to test whether the analysis methods described in the preceding section are capable of delivering the promised results , in this section we will apply these techniques to gyrokinetic simulations with known properties , carried out with the code euterpe .",
    "euterpe is a global gyrokinetic particle - in - cell monte carlo code developed originally at crpp lausanne  @xcite with the aim of simulating plasma turbulence in arbitrary threedimensional geometries .",
    "it is being developed at the max plank ipp ( greifswald , germany )  @xcite and is presently used at the national fusion laboratory ( ciemat , spain ) for the simulation of tj - ii plasmas . for more information about the code",
    "the reader is referred to the cited references .",
    "several linear simulations have been run in tj - ii geometry : linear simulations of zonal flow relaxation  @xcite and simulations of ion temperature gradient ( itg ) instabilities  @xcite .",
    "results from these two kinds of simulations are used in this work to test the zonal flow detection technique .      in this kind of simulation",
    ", the relaxation of an initial zonal perturbation to the density is studied following the seminal work by rosenbluth and hinton  @xcite .",
    "the simulation is initiated with a perturbation to the density of the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the normalized toroidal flux used as radial coordinate in euterpe , @xmath74 the equilibrium density , @xmath75 the radial wavenumber of the perturbation , @xmath76 the ion larmor radius , @xmath77 and @xmath78 the ion mass and charge , respectively , @xmath79 the equilibrium ion temperature , @xmath80 the magnetic field and @xmath81 means flux surface average .",
    "the simulation is carried out in the standard magnetic configuration of tj - ii ( labelled 100_44_64 ) under plasma conditions in which a neoclassical root confinement transition ( the so - called low density transition ) occurs at the plasma edge .",

    "the zonal component of the potential ( @xmath84 ) is observed to relax via a low frequency damped oscillation , typical for stellarators  @xcite , and also higher frequency oscillations identified as geodesic acoustic modes ( gam ) appear ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "this propagation would be _ radial _ , not poloidal / toroidal , in view of the near identity of the topos 3 and 4 in the two remote probes , which is consistent with the gam nature of the fluctuations ( constancy of potential on flux surfaces ) .    thus having identified modes 1 and modes 3 + 4 , mode 2 remains .",

    "while bearing this in mind , it is shown that the bod is a powerful technique to separate zf - like , global oscillations from other ( propagating ) oscillations and to extract their mode structure . in this framework , it has been speculated that microscale turbulence might not only interact with zonal flows , but also with mhd modes @xcite .",
    "this would imply the existence of an ( indirect ) interaction between zfs and mhd modes .",
    "indeed , in the past it has been observed that the growth of zfs may modify mhd activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected that the methodology presented here could help clarifying this issue , or more generally , yield fruitful results for a wide range of multipoint ( and remote ) measurements in systems with long range correlated structures .",
