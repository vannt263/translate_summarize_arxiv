    "since the discovery of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , l@xmath3@xmath410@xmath5 ) by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) in the 1980 s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is widely accepted that ulirgs result from strong interactions / mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "these mergers form elliptical galaxies and ulirgs are an important intermediate stage in the process during which at least a fraction of ulirgs manifest as dust - enshrouded qsos ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) triggered by mergers tend to appear at the final merging stages ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and reference therein ) .    there is mounting evidence that qsos with far - infrared ( fir ) excess have massive starbursts in their host galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated 9 qsos with fir excess and found that their host galaxies are tidally interacting or major merger systems with obvious recent star - forming activities . from the detections of mid - infrared ( mir)/firm , fir 35 - 350 @xmath1 m , and ir 8 - 1000@xmath1 m . ]",
    "emissions for felobals ( broad absorption line qsos with low - ionisation and iron absorption lines ) by multiband imaging photometer on _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , @xcite find that all their 9 felobals are extremely infrared ( ir ) bright , and concluded that these qsos are in transition from ulirgs to classical qsos with ongoing or recent starbursts , because the iron absorption may be from iron ejected during starbursts .",
    "@xcite studied 31 qsos / seyfert1s selected from the local ulirg samples ( termed as ir  qsos for simplicity ) . by comparing the fir spectral index of ir  qsos with those of optically selected palomar - green qsos ( pg  qsos ; @xcite )",
    ", they argued that the fir excess of ir  qsos relative to pg  qsos is from massive starbursts and inferred star formation rate ( sfr ) in the host galaxies of ir  qsos .",
    "recently , from studies of z@xmath06 qsos with strong sub - mm emissions , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite concluded that massive starbursts also exist in their host galaxies .",
    "the conclusion is consistent with the results of @xcite that high redshift ( sub)mm - loud qsos follow the same trend for fir to bolometric luminosities established by low redshift ir  qsos @xcite .",
    "all these studies suggest that there exists a transitional stage , during which both the central black hole and the spheroidal component of qso hosts grow rapidly in a coeval fashion .",
    "however , there is still a debate about the origin of fir emission from qsos , because one can not firmly exclude the possibility that fir emissions are from dust tori heated by central agns ( for detailed discussions see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , from the molecular gas properties of pg  qsos with ir excess and comparisons with ulirgs , @xcite find that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 ratios for pg  qsos are higher than those of ulirgs , implying that agns contribute significantly to the dust heating and hence to the fir emission .",
    "therefore , other sfr indicators besides the fir emission for qsos are important for further understanding the coeval growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies .",
    "recently , the quest ( quasar and ulirg evolution study ) group ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features in pg  qsos using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on _ spitzer _ @xcite . for 11 out of 26 pg  qsos pahs",
    "have been clearly detected .",
    "furthermore , the average spectrum of the undetected 15 pg  qsos also shows pah features . since the pah emissions are closely related to star formation , not to agns ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such detections strongly suggest that star formation occurs widely in qsos .",
    "their analysis shows that 30% or more fir emission in these pg  qsos is from starbursts .",
    "furthermore , given that the low - excitation fine - structure emission line [ neii ] 12.81@xmath1 m is one of the dominant emission lines of hii regions and that the pah molecules are easily destroyed by high energy photons from agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , [ neii ] emission may be an alternative , perhaps even better , tracer of star formation for qsos ( see  4 ) .",
    "in this paper we study the mir spectroscopic properties of ir  qsos based on _ spitzer _ irs observations , and examine their connections and evolutionary relations to ulirgs and pg  qsos .",
    "the sample selection , data acquisition and reduction are described in sect . 2 and 3 .",

    "our basic ir  qso samples are compiled from ulirg samples with spectroscopic information , plus the ir  qsos obtained directly from the cross - correlation of the _ iras _ point - source catalog with the _ rosat _ all - sky survey catalog .",
    "the ulirg samples consist of 118 ulirgs from 1@xmath16jy ulirgs survey @xcite and 97 ulirgs from the qdot redshift survey @xcite . the total number of ir  qsos is 31 , about one third of all the ir  qsos found in a complete redshift survey with 15,411 _ iras _ galaxies and about 900 ulirgs ( pscz ; @xcite ) .",

    "this second pg  qso sample has deep sl mode observations ( 5.2 - 14.5@xmath1 m ) and is thus suitable for studying weak pah emission features in continuum - dominated qsos , and for analysing properties of the mir fine - structure lines ( especially [ neii]12.81@xmath1 m line in this work ) from high - resolution observations .",

    "since classical qsos have much lower fir emissions than ir  qsos at a given bolometric luminosity @xcite , and @xmath2(30 , 15 ) is correlated with @xmath2(60 , 25 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_alpha ] and  [ sec : statis ] ) , it is easy to understand why the @xmath2(30 , 15 ) slopes are steeper for ir  qsos than those of classical qsos ( for details see  [ sec : statis ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "apparently the pah molecules in ir  qsos can survive the fuv and x - ray photons emitted by central agn , suggesting that they are shielded by a large amount of gas and dust from radiation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the bolometric luminosities ( l@xmath26 ) of pg  qsos observed by irs of _ spitzer _ are systematically smaller than those of ir  qsos , where l@xmath26 is calculated from the optical continuum emission ( @xmath27 , @xcite ) , the differences in their ir continuum shapes may simply arise because more optically luminous qsos have more extended dust tori . to check this possibility , we investigated the 6.2@xmath1 m pah and [ neii]12.81@xmath1 m luminosities normalised by l@xmath26 .",

    "thus both [ neii ] 12.81@xmath1 m and pah 6.2@xmath1 m luminosities can be used as approximate sfr indicators not only for normal star - forming galaxies , but also for galaxies with high infrared luminosities , such as ulirgs and ir  qsos ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the mean scatters ( about 0.7 to 0.8 dex ) in the relation of [ neii]12.81@xmath1 m , pah 6.2@xmath1 m with @xmath39 luminosities are larger than that ( about 0.6 dex ) of star - forming galaxies with lower infrared luminosity ( @xcite ) . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig_sfr ] with fig .",
    "[ fig_ne2pah ] , one can see that the scatter in the relation of [ neii]12.81@xmath1 m vs. pah 6.2@xmath1 m luminosities ( about 0.6 dex ) is smaller than that in the relations of [ neii]12.81@xmath1 m , pah 6.2@xmath1 m luminosities with l(60@xmath1 m ) .",
    "it is also clear that most large scatters are from ulirgs .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since the range in the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption depth among ulirgs is quite large ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in short ,",
    "the large scatters for ulirgs seen in the relations may be due to complicated , patchy extinctions among these galaxies in the mir band .",
    "a detailed discussion on extinction for ulirgs can be found in @xcite .",
    "one explanation for the observed correlation between spheroidal and black hole mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that star formation and the growth of central black holes may be self - regulated : agns / star formation can drive nuclear outflows which in turn suppress further cooling and star formation ( @xcite ) . while the detailed processes are still to be understood , it is now increasingly clear that feedback and outflows play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "so far most observational evidence for agn feedback is from radio observations at the centre of clusters or groups of galaxies @xcite . on the galaxy scale ,",
    "evidence is still limited . as discussed above ,",
    "ir  qsos have high sfrs and accretion rates @xcite , outflow properties in these objects may thus provide hints on the feedback processes on galaxy or group scale .",
    "it is well known that low - ionisation broad absorption line qsos ( lobal  qsos ) comprise about 15% of bal  qso population .",
    "they are defined as a subclass of bal  qsos with an obvious blueshifted absorption in mg ii @xmath40@xmath402795,2802 and other low - ionisation species @xcite .",
    "such absorption troughs arise from resonance absorption by outflowing gas and dust @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a rare class of lobal  qsos , showing absorption features from excited iron ( termed as felobal  qsos ) .",
    "the outflow velocities for most bal  qsos span a large range , up to a few times @xmath41 kms@xmath9 , which may be formed on a scale of @xmath42 and directly associated with the wind from an accretion disk or molecular torus @xcite .",
    "however , recent spectral analyses based on keck observations for lobal  qsos or felobal  qsos reveal that the outflow velocities of some lobal  qsos range from several hundred to several thousand kms@xmath9 and the wind is from regions of a few hundred pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is much larger than the central engine of agns , but similar to the size of the nuclear starburst region of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite studied four lobal  qsos at z@xmath430.4 ( mrk  231 , iras  14026@xmath444341 , iras  f07599 + 6508 , pg  1700 + 518 ; all four are in our sample ) and found that all are ulirgs with merging signatures .",
    "they argued that lobal  qsos can not simply be explained by orientation effects , rather , they are directly related to young systems , still surrounded by gas and dust .",
    "it represents a short stage in the early life of a large fraction of qsos .",
    "moreover , @xcite reported the detections of mid / far - infrared emission from 9 felobal qsos by mips .",
    "they found that all of their objects are ir bright with infrared luminosities as high as ulirgs .",
    "thus all lobal  qsos and felobal qsos with mir to fir information are infrared ultra - luminous , suggesting a link among lobal  qsos , felobal qsos and ir  qsos .    for lobal  qsos or felobal qsos",
    ", the velocities of outflows can be measured from blueshifted absorption lines .",
    "unfortunately it is still unclear whether most ir  qsos are lobal  qsos or felobal qsos , because not many ir qsos have been observed in the uv .",
    "however , there are measurements for the blueshifts in the permitted optical emission lines for our ir  qso sample @xcite .",
    "the line profiles often contain two gaussian components , one broad and one narrow .",
    "the outflow velocities are determined by the blueshift of the broad gaussian component relative to the narrow component of permitted emission lines ( h@xmath45 ) for ir  qsos ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the blueshifted broad gaussian component is related to the outflow of clouds @xcite .",
    "[ fig_outflow ] shows the correlation between ew ( pah 6.2@xmath1 m ) and outflow velocities for ir  qsos . as the outflow velocity increases , the ew ( pah 6.2@xmath1 m ) decreases . since the ew ( pah 6.2@xmath1 m ) expresses the relative contribution of star formation to agn in qsos ( see @xmath204.2 ) ,",
    "the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_outflow ] implies that qsos with higher outflow velocities have a lower ratio of sfr to accretion rate",
    ". it may be because more energetic agns and central massive starbursts can drive faster outflows which then suppress or even quench star formation by heating up or expelling the cold gas and dust in the qso hosts , leading to a lower ratio of sfr to accretion rate .",
    "another possibility is that the higher velocity outflows are more efficient in ejecting dust cocoons of agns , leading to agns becoming the dominant source compared with starbursts .",
    "we should caution , however , that the sample shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_outflow ] is small ; a larger sample would allow us to better understand the relative importance of star formation and agn in feedback and driving outflows .",
    "in this work , we studied the mir spectral properties of low - redshift ir  qsos based on spectroscopic observations with _ spitzer _ irs , and compared their properties with those of ulirgs and optically - selected pg  qsos .",
    "the following are our main results :    \\1 .",
    "the average mir spectra , mir spectral slopes , 6.2@xmath1 m pah emission strengths and [ neii ] 12.81@xmath1 m luminosities of ir  qsos are distinct from those of pg  qsos .",
    "the mir properties of ir  qsos are intermediate between ulirgs and optically - selected qsos , indicating that ir  qsos are at a transitional stage from ulirgs to classical qsos .",
    "\\2 . from the correlations between @xmath2(30 , 15 ) with @xmath2(60 , 25 ) , fir excess l@xmath30/l@xmath26 , and ew ( pah 6.2@xmath1 m ) for both ir  qsos and pg  qsos , we find that the mir colour index @xmath2(30 , 15 ) is a good indicator of the relative contribution of starbursts to agns for all qsos .",
    "both pah and [ neii]12.81@xmath1 m luminosities of ir  qsos are in the same range as those of ulirgs , but are one order of magnitude higher than those of pg  qsos ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] ) . from the tight correlation between pah 6.2@xmath1 m and [ neii ] 12.81@xmath1 m luminosities for ir  qsos , ulirgs and pah detected pg  qsos , and the fact that the l@xmath29}$]/l@xmath26 ratio for ir  qsos is about one order of magnitude higher than that of classical qsos , we conclude that the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath1 m emission of ir  qsos is dominated by star formation , thus their luminosity can be used as an approximate indicator of their sfrs .",
    "outflows in ir  qsos play an important role in suppressing star formation by heating and/or expelling cold gas surrounding nuclei of qsos .",
