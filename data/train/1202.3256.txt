    "almost eighty years after the proposal by baade & zwicky that ( core - collapse ) supernovae represent the transition of an ordinary massive star into a neutron star @xcite , we still lack a complete understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "in particular , we do not know with certitude how the _ supernova mechanism _ operates and converts the necessary fraction of gravitational energy of collapse into kinetic energy and light of the explosive outflow .",
    "the basic story line of core collapse goes as follows ( see @xcite for detailed reviews ) : at the end of a massive star s (",
    "@xmath3 at zero - age main sequence [ zams ] ) life , nuclear burning has ceased in its core , which is then composed primarily of iron - group nuclei ( or o - ne nuclei at the lower end of the mass range ) and supported against gravity by the pressure of relativistically degenerate electrons . eventually , the core exceeds its effective chandrasekhar mass and dynamical collapse sets in .",
    "the collapsing core separates into subsonically infalling homologous @xmath4 inner core and supersonically collapsing outer core @xcite .",
    "when the inner core reaches nuclear density , the repulsive core of the nuclear force leads to a stiffening of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the inner core , suddenly supported by the stiff supernuclear eos , overshoots its new equilibrium , then bounces back into the still infalling outer core .",
    "a shock wave forms at the sonic point between inner and outer core at an enclosed baryonic mass of @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "it quickly moves out in radius and mass , but must do work in breaking up infalling iron - group nuclei .",
    "this and neutrino losses from electron capture in the region behind the shock sap its might .",
    "the shock succumbs to the ram pressure of the outer core , stalls , and turns into an accretion shock .",
    "the shock must be re - energized to drive a core - collapse supernova explosion and , in the canonical scenario , leave behind a neutrino - cooling and contracting protoneutron star .",
    "this shock revival must , depending on progenitor star structure , occur within @xmath5@xmath7 , otherwise accretion will push the protoneutron star over its maximum mass , leading to collapse and black hole formation @xcite . understanding the supernova mechanism , which must robustly revive the stalled shock in supernovae from massive stars that are observed on a daily basis ,",
    "is the principle current challenge of core - collapse supernova theory .",
    "observational clues for the supernova mechanism are few .",
    "electromagnetic waves are emitted in optically thin regions far from the core and thus yield only second - hand information about the supernova mechanism .",
    "yet , observations of ejecta morphology , spatial distributions of nucleosynthetic yields and pulsar kicks are indicative of aspherical ( i.e. , multi - dimensional ) processes bearing relevance in the explosion dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "neutrinos , on the other hand , are emitted deep inside the core and can provide crucial thermodynamic , structural , and , to some extent , dynamical information on what occurs in the core @xcite .",
    "the few neutrinos captured from supernova 1987a @xcite have impressively confirmed the very basic picture of core collapse outlined in the above .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) , like neutrinos emitted from dense regions impenetrable by photons , carry dynamical information about their source . since their emission occurs at lowest order by accelerated quadrupole motions , gws",
    "are direct probes of multi - dimensional dynamics in the core that may play a crucial role in the supernova mechanism @xcite .",
    "stellar collapse has long been considered a promising source of gws for detectors on earth ( see the historical overview in @xcite ) and much effort has gone into understanding the gw signature of stellar collapse and the subsequent evolution towards a core - collapse supernova explosion . this has led to the identification of a range of emission processes , including rotating collapse and core bounce , nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities , aspherical outflows , convection / turbulence in the protoneutron star and in the region immediately behind the shock , instabilities of the standing accretion shock , pulsations of the protoneutron star , asymmetric emission of neutrinos , and magnetic stresses ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the most recent set of simulations @xcite suggest that gws from the average core - collapse supernova may be visible throughout the milky way for the second generation of laser interferometer gw observatories , including advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and lcgt @xcite .",
    "extreme emission scenarios may allow detection throughout the local group of galaxies , including the andromeda galaxy  @xcite , but third - generation detectors such as the einstein telescope @xcite might hope to observe more distant events .    if it was possible to associate an explosion mechanism with particular multi - dimensional dynamics that leads to a characteristic gw signal , then the detection or non - detection of such a signal from the next galactic core - collapse supernova could confirm or rule out this mechanism .",
    "to realize such an gw - observational test of the explosion mechanism , one must separate the signal from detector noise and determine its parameters , e.g. , by matching , in some way , to signal predictions from simulations . the most straightforward method for signal extraction and parameter estimation",
    "is matched filtering ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which looks for a match of detector data with waveform templates from simulations .",
    "matched filtering requires exact knowledge of the expected signal , which is possible , e.g. , for the inspiral phase of compact binaries , since the parameter space of binary systems is limited , all relevant physics is understood ( at least in the black - hole  black - hole binary case ) and numerical relativity simulations can predict essentially exact waveform templates ( i.e. , limited only by numerical error ) .",
    "however , building waveform catalogs with exact predictions for matched filtering is impossible for gws from core - collapse supernovae . on the one hand",
    ", there is unknown physics ( e.g. , the nuclear eos ) and many unconstrained parameters ( e.g. , the details of the precollapse configuration are poorly known ) in the stellar collapse problem .",
    "this alone would require extensive parameter studies to build up template databases covering the poorly constrained parameter space .",
    "on the other hand , all expected gw emission processes in core - collapse supernovae are influenced or dominated by turbulent flow .",
    "hence , their gw signals have a stochastic component that is impossible to predict , even if all initial conditions and physics were known exactly .",
    "matched filtering is not applicable to such gw bursts . to extract the gw signal from the next galactic core collapse event and determine source physics such as the explosion mechanism , an approach to signal extraction / reconstruction , model selection , and parameter estimation",
    "is needed that can handle the stochastic nature of the expected gw signals .",
    "the reconstruction of both polarizations of a gw signal requires coincident observations of two detectors ; linearly polarized signals can be reconstructed from data of just one detector and adding a third detector overdetermines the problem , permitting the source position on the sky to be determined @xcite .",
    "gw signal reconstruction was pioneered by grsel & tinto  @xcite with a maximum likelihood approach , variants @xcite of which have been incorporated into search pipelines for gw bursts @xcite .",
    "summerscales _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first to study signal reconstruction and parameter estimation for the gw burst from rotating core collapse and bounce based on waveforms of ott  _ et  al . _",
    "they injected signals into real detector noise of early ligo science runs and used a maximum entropy approach to reconstruct the signal using data from two detectors without any a priori knowledge of the signal shape .",
    "cross - correlation of the reconstructed signal with signal predictions of @xcite was then used to determine source parameters .    incorporating gw signal information from core collapse simulations into detection and signal reconstruction approaches",
    "was first considered by brady & ray - majumder @xcite , who realized that the gw burst from rotating collapse and bounce , while being unpredictable in detail , has robust features that can be isolated mathematically .",
    "they created an orthonormal vectorspace of waveforms from @xcite using gram - schmidt orthonormalization and isolated a subspace of essential features most common to all waveforms .",

    "@xcite went a step further and combined pca with bayesian inference using the markov - chain monte carlo technique for computing marginalization integrals ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a pedagogical introduction to bayesian methods ) .",
    "they considered linearly - polarized waveforms from rotating core collapse and bounce and were able to reconstruct signals from modeled noise in a single detector and infer key parameters , e.g. , the nuclear eos used in the simulation that led to a given trial waveform .    in this paper",
    ", we present a proof - of - principle study to demonstrate that the core - collapse supernova explosion mechanism can be inferred from the gw signal of a galactic core - collapse supernova observed with second - generation gw observatories such as advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and lcgt .",
    "we consider the neutrino mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the magnetorotational mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the acoustic mechanism @xcite , discuss their essentials , and argue that they bear distinct gw signatures as first pointed out by ott  @xcite , which is a prerequisite for our study .",
    "we follow the approach of rver  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite and , for simplicity , restrict ourselves to a single detector , linearly polarized signals , and a gaussian noise model at the noise level of advanced ligo in broadband mode .",
    "like rver  _ et  al .",
    "_ , we adopt a bayesian approach and use pca , but , for the first time , apply it to multiple waveform catalogs .",
    "we associate each waveform catalog with one of the three mechanisms and calculate bayes evidence ratios using the nested sampling algorithm  @xcite to determine what mechanism s pcs match best with a given injected signal .",
    "we demonstrate that this approach can identify any of the considered explosion mechanisms with high confidence for core collapse events occurring at distances of up to @xmath5@xmath8 .",
    "the magnetorotational explosion mechanism can even be inferred throughout the milky way ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition to studying the explosion mechanism , we also consider the problem of determining whether a core collapse event is a rapidly rotating ordinary iron core collapse or an accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a massive white dwarf .",
    "these two processes are governed by the same physics and differences in their waveforms are subtle  @xcite , but our approach is still capable of telling them apart .",
    "this article is structured as follows : section  [ sec : snmech ] reviews the set of considered candidate core - collapse supernova mechanisms , their individual gw signatures , and the gw signal catalogs that we draw model waveforms from . in section",

    "in this study , we consider the neutrino mechanism , the magnetorotational mechanism , and the acoustic mechanism for core - collapse supernova explosions and describe them and their characteristic gw signal features in the following sections .",

    "if only a small fraction of the energy released in neutrinos is re - absorbed behind the stalled shock , leading to net heating , an explosion could be launched and endowed with the energy to account for the observed range of asymptotic explosion energies of @xmath14-@xmath15 of garden - variety core - collapse supernovae  @xcite . this is the gist of the neutrino mechanism of core - collapse supernovae , which , in its early form was proposed by arnett  @xcite and colgate & white @xcite , and in its modern form by bethe & wilson  @xcite .    despite its appealing simplicity , the neutrino mechanism , in its purest , spherically - symmetric ( 1d ) form , fails to revive the shock in all but the lowest - mass massive stars with o - ne cores @xcite .",
    "there is now strong evidence from axisymmetric ( 2d ) @xcite and first 3d @xcite simulations that the breaking of spherical symmetry is key to the success of the neutrino mechanism . in 2d and 3d , neutrino - driven convection in the region of net heating behind the shock , and the standing - accretion - shock instability ( sasi ) @xcite increase the efficiency of the neutrino mechanism @xcite .     from matter dynamics in axisymmetric simulations that can be associated with the neutrino mechanism ( top panel , taken from @xcite ) , the magnetorotational mechanism ( center panel , taken from @xcite , and the acoustic mechanism ( bottom panel , taken from @xcite ) .",

    "leaving rapid rotation aside for a moment , the dominant multi - dimensional gw - emitting dynamics in neutrino - driven core - collapse supernovae are convection in the protoneutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ) and sasi - modulated convection in the region behind the stalled shock .",

    "right after core bounce , an initial burst of gws is emitted by strong , so - called prompt convection @xcite , driven by the negative entropy gradient left behind by the stalling shock .",
    "subsequently , the gw signal settles at lower amplitudes , then picks up again as the sasi reaches its non - linear phase and high - velocity accretion downstreams penetrate deep into the region behind the shock , where they are decelerated , leading to pronounced spikes in the wave signal  @xcite .",
    "the secular rise in the signal amplitude towards the end of the waveform is due to the onset of an aspherical explosion @xcite , but occurs at too low characteristic frequencies to be visible to advanced ligo - class detectors .",

    "overall , the detectable gw signal from a neutrino - driven nonrotating or slowly rotating core - collapse supernova will have random polarization , a broadband spectrum from @xmath5@xmath16 and typical strain amplitudes @xmath17 of order @xmath18 , with individual peaks reaching @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "the effects of rotation on the neutrino mechanism and its gw signature are not yet fully understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and it can not be excluded that contributions from rotational dynamics may modify the gw signal of neutrino - driven core - collapse supernovae .",
    "however , results from the systematic rotating core collapse studies of @xcite suggest that once rotation rates become sufficiently high to alter the dynamics , the explosion is actually more likely to occur via the magnetorotational mechanism discussed in  [ sec : mhdmech ] .",

    "this rather disappointing result can be explained as follows : while the waveforms are qualitatively very similar to the waveforms , they differ significantly in quantitative aspects .",
    "the waveforms are generally only half as long ( @xmath5@xmath31 for and @xmath185 for , whose models explode much earlier than the models ) .",
    "furthermore , the waveforms have considerably more power at frequencies above @xmath5@xmath186 and their energy spectra peak at @xmath5@xmath187 while most of the emission in the waveforms occurs at or below @xmath5@xmath188 .",
    "this may be due to the more simplified treatment of gravity and neutrino microphysics and transport in the study of murphy  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite underlying the catalog compared to the work of yakunin  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite that led to the catalog .",
    "in this article , we have described the supernova model evidence extractor ( smee ) , a novel bayesian approach to inferring physical information from observations of gw bursts emitted in stellar collapse and core - collapse supernovae .",
    "smee decomposes catalogs of simulated gw signals into their principle components and employs the nested sampling algorithm to compute the evidence that a trial signal injected into gw detector noise belongs to a given catalog .",
    "it is evident that core - collapse supernovae are powered by the release of gravitational energy in gravitational collapse , but the central unsolved problem of core - collapse supernova theory is by what mechanism this energy is transferred from the collapsed core to the stellar mantle to drive the explosion .",
    "simulations show that multi - dimensional gw - emitting dynamics is a crucial ingredient to all potential explosion mechanisms .",
    "hence , gws could be ideal probes for the core - collapse supernova mechanism , provided that different mechanism models have clearly distinct gw signatures . in this paper ,",
    "we have considered ( _ i _ ) the neutrino mechanism , ( _ ii _ ) the magnetorotational mechanism , and ( _ iii _ ) the acoustic mechanism for core - collapse supernova explosions and have treated mechanism as equally probable ( i.e. , having the same prior probability ) .",
    "the primary and dominant multi - dimensional dynamics and gw emission processes of these mechanisms are , ordered in the above order of mechanisms , ( _ i _ ) convection / turbulence and accretion downstreams , ( _ ii _ ) rapid rotation , and ( _ iii _ ) protoneutron star core pulsations , respectively .    using gw signal catalogs based on simulations representative of these three mechanisms ,",
    "we have applied smee to infer the explosion mechanism underlying trial waveforms injected into simulated advanced ligo noise .",
    "our results show that our bayesian approach is capable of identifying any of the considered explosion mechanisms with high confidence for core collapse events occurring out to a distance of @xmath5@xmath8 even with only rudimentary knowledge of the precise shape of the expected signal .",
    "magnetorotational explosions , leading to particularly strong gw signals with very robust common features , can be clearly identified throughout the milky way ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "our results also suggest that it is possible to further distinguish between rapidly rotating accretion - induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and rapidly rotating iron core collapse for events occurring in the galaxy , provided that the differences between the gw signals predicted by current simulations of rotating accretion - induced collapse and rotating iron core collapse are reliable .",
    "gw signals emitted by neutrino - driven explosions have systematically lower amplitudes and , hence , are harder to distinguish from detector noise .",
    "moreover , gw emission from convection / turbulence and accretion downstreams has not been as extensively studied , the available number of model waveforms is an order of magnitude smaller , and the currently predicted gw signals are not as reliable as in the case of rapidly rotating collapse .",
    "this reduces the efficacy of the principal component decomposition and , combined with the overall weakness of the signals , limits smee s robust reach for the neutrino mechanism to @xmath189@xmath8 for the currently available set of model waveforms and advanced ligo in broadband configuration .",
    "the gw signals from core - collapse supernovae driven by the acoustic mechanism are strong and would likely be detectable by advanced ligo throughout the milky way .",
    "however , the set of available model waveforms for this signal type is very limited and individual waveforms differ significantly at large scales in the time domain while having similar frequency content .",
    "the inclusion of phase information ( by computing pcs in the time domain and using their full complex fourier transforms ) in the current incarnation of smee is sub - optimal for such signals and the pcs only inefficiently span the space of possible waveforms .",
    "this makes it difficult for smee to clearly identify the acoustic mechanism for core collapse events occurring at distances significantly greater than @xmath5@xmath8 .",
    "this study is the first systematic attempt at inferring core - collapse supernova physics from observations of gw bursts emitted by multiple different underlying mechanisms .",
    "while this is a significant step beyond previous work that focused only on gws from rotating core collapse @xcite , our present study still suffers from a number of simplifying assumptions : we have considered only a single detector , gaussian noise , and linearly polarized , optimally oriented gw emission .",
    "real core - collapse supernovae will emit in both gw polarizations and will have arbitrary , generally non - optimal orientation with respect to observatories on earth .",
    "advanced ligo class gw detectors will operate as networks and observations will be coincident between three or even four detectors , and the noise backgrounds of these detectors will not be stationary and gaussian , but non - stationary and glitchy .",
    "we have also been agnostic with regard to the prior probability of the three considered core - collapse supernova mechanisms .",
    "input from astronomical observations and theory could be used to generate ( approximate ) prior probabilities for each mechanism , which could then be included in a future analysis .    near future work on smee will be directed towards incorporating detector networks , variations in detector configurations and sensitivities , both gw polarizations , non - gaussian noise , arbitrary source  detector orientations , and improved principal component analysis with and without reliance on the signal phase . however , even with these improvements , successful extraction of physics from core - collapse supernova gw signals will crucially depend on the availability of extensive catalogs of reliable predictions for both @xmath177 and @xmath176 .",
    "these must be provided by the core - collapse supernova modeling community on the basis of full 3d simulations .",
