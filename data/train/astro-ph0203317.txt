    "the diverse group of low luminosity ( m@xmath1 ) local group dwarf galaxies is loosely divided ( based on their recent star formation history , sfh , and neutral gas content ) into three categories : dwarf irregulars ( dirr ) , intermediate type dwarfs ( dirr / dsph ) , and dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) . despite some obvious differences",

    "local group dsph galaxies are known to have a wide range of sfhs  from being consistent with a single burst scenario ( e.g. ursa minor ) to the very complex multiple bursts case of carina @xcite .",
    "low luminosity dsphs have not formed stars for at least a gyr .",
    "intermediate type ( dirr / dsph ) local group dwarfs ( lgs  3 , antlia , and phoenix ) had their most recent star bursts @xmath4  myr ago @xcite .",

    "a few scenarios have been proposed to explain the complex sfh of dsph galaxies , including episodic accretion of intergalactic gas @xcite , ism heating by sn  ia leading to prolonged periods of time with no star formation @xcite , and bar induced star bursts in the tidally stirred dwarfs scenario of @xcite .    aside from the differences in the present day star formation rate ( sfr ) , low luminosity galaxies from the sequence dirr ",

    "we propose a novel mechanism which can explain the differences in sfhs and neutral gas content between dsphs and dirrs .",
    "our hypothesis is that the electromagnetic radiation ( especially lyman continuum , lyc , and far ultraviolet , fuv ) escaping from the host spiral galaxy can play a decisive role in the evolution of dsphs .",
    "significant amounts of gas can be ionized and heated by the host galaxy lyc when dsphs are on the relatively high galactic latitude parts of their orbits .",
    "fuv can also play a role by preventing the formation of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) phase of the ism , which presence is believed to be required for star formation . moving along their orbits around the host galaxy , dsphs spend relatively short periods of time near the plane of the host , where the fluxes of the lyc and fuv radiation drop to lower metagalactic levels . for some of the dwarfs ,",
    "the time spent in the shadow produced by the h  i disk of the host spiral is enough for their ism to recombine , cool down and form stars in a short burst .",

    "dsph galaxies with total masses @xmath16  m@xmath6 gradually lose their ism when the gas is ionized and heated to @xmath17  k by the lyc radiation from the host galaxy , leading to the globally declining sfr .",

    "the morphology and kinematics of the disturbed gas is then consistent with an ionization - shock ( is ) front driven by the lyc radiation from m31 toward the centre of ngc  205 with a velocity of @xmath256  km  s@xmath7 ( fig .",

    "[ fig_n205 ] , we estimate that the shock front has already traveled @xmath140  pc inside the dwarf , indicating that the process started very recently : @xmath156  myr ago ( kinematic age ) .",

    "at such a small distance , the lyc and fuv fluxes from m31 should be significant for most of the lifetime of ngc  205 , with only short periods every 500  myr with much lower levels of radiation during the passages through the plane of the host spiral galaxy .",
    "carina and ursa minor dwarf spheroidals belong to the class of the lowest luminosity dsph galaxies .",
    "they have comparable luminosity ( @xmath259\\times 10 ^ 5 $ ]  l@xmath6 ) , core radius ( @xmath260  pc ) , central mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath261 ) , and distance from the milky way galaxy ( @xmath262  kpc ) @xcite .",
    "it is very surprising then that they exhibit two opposite sfh extremes : carina has formed stars for most of its lifetime in three discrete bursts 3 , 7 , and 15  gyr ago @xcite , whereas ursa minor was formed in a single star burst @xmath263  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "we note that carina has the smallest absolute value of the galactic latitude @xmath264 among all the milky way satellite galaxies ( excluding the special case of the sagittarius dsph ) .",
    "this is consistent with carina having relatively small angle between its orbit and the plane of the galaxy  probably as small as @xmath265 .",
    "if this is the case , the dwarf has spent a significant part of its lifetime hiding from the ionizing and fuv radiation from the milky way near the plane of the galaxy , keeping its ism neutral and episodically forming stars .",
    "the opposite example is that of ursa minor .",
    "both the proper motion measurements @xcite and the relatively high location above the galactic plane ( @xmath266 ) suggest that the dwarf is on a close to polar orbit around the milky way galaxy .",
    "galaxies less massive than @xmath90  m@xmath6 should gradually lose their ism when the gas is fully photoionized .",
    "we argue that the relatively small distance from the galaxy and the almost polar orbit caused ursa minor to lose its ism on a short time scale , leading to sharply declining sfr .",
    "theoretical description of the formation and evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies is a complex problem , which is far from being fully resolved .",
    "nevertheless , recent semi - analytical models @xcite appear to converge in that the isolated gas - rich dwarfs should have been forming stars with almost constant low efficiency for most of their lifetimes , with a possible exception of the early epoch ( @xmath267 ) with increased sfr .",
    "the emerging consensus is that soon after the initial star burst , the star formation becomes self - regulated through the feedback from massive stars ( impact on the ism of stellar winds , ionizing and fuv radiation , and supernovae ) .",

    "the situation with early - type dwarfs ( dsph and de ) is even more complicated .",

    "absence of neutral gas .",
    "_ with a few exceptions , the local group early - type dwarfs appear to be devoid of h  i and h@xmath228  despite showing in many cases the evidence for recent star formation .",
    "for example , fornax has a very low h  i mass upper limit of @xmath269  m@xmath6 @xcite , but formed stars as recently as 200  myr ago @xcite .",
    "3 .   _ episodic sfh . _ some local group dsph / de galaxies have puzzling gaps of @xmath210  gyr in their sfhs .",
    "these time intervals are much longer than the @xmath270  yr timescales of internal mechanisms which could effect the star formation ,  with a possible exception of the sne  ia heating mechanism @xcite .",
    "in this paper we showed that all the above observational facts can be explained by the impact of the ultraviolet radiation from the host spiral galaxy on the ism of dwarf satellites .",
    "we gave evidence in support of the following key ingredients of our model :    1 .",
    "fuv and lyc fluxes from giant spiral galaxies are sufficiently large to alter the state of the ism in nearby dwarf galaxies such that star formation becomes unlikely .",
    "the lyc radiation can ionize the ism through the process of photoevaporation , making it very hard to detect .",
    "2 .   the uv radiation from spiral galaxies like the milky way and m31 dominates over the metagalactic background radiation within a large sphere of radius @xmath271  kpc .",
    "the ultraviolet radiation field of a spiral galaxy is strongly anisotropic , with the flux dropping almost to zero in the narrow zone near the plane of the galaxy .    in our scenario ,",
    "low mass galaxies orbiting around large spirals spend most of their lifetimes exposed to the ultraviolet radiation from their host galaxies , which keeps their ism in warm ( @xmath17  k ) and ionized state . twice per orbital period",
    ", each satellite crosses a narrow `` shadow '' zone near the plane of host galaxy , where the ultraviolet flux is dramatically reduced by the absorption in the h  i disk of the spiral . during",
    "such `` eclipses '' , the ism of the dwarf galaxy can recombine , cool down , and collapse toward the centre of the dwarf on timescales of @xmath65  myr .",
    "we expect the cold dense gas at the centre of the dwarf to become self - gravitating , and under favorable conditions to start forming stars . for a short time",
    ", such early - type dwarfs can turn into a dirr galaxy , with the two - phase ism structure , and the low efficiency star formation self - regulated through the feedback mechanisms . approaching the edge of the shadow zone , the dwarf galaxy experiences an increase in the external fuv flux , which can warm up the ism and quench the star formation .",
    "finally , the increased lyc flux can photoionize the warm ism through the process of photoevaporation .",
    "an important issue we have to address is whether observations of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are consistent with our scenario .",
    "hvcs are h  i clouds which are well separated in radial velocity from the galactic h  i disk @xcite . with a few exceptions , distances to hvcs are either unknown or strongly model - dependent ( like magellanic stream ) .",

    "two sculptor h  i clouds @xcite , that are most probably physically associated with the sculptor dsph @xcite , would have a low peak h@xmath117 flux of 22  mr in our galactic lyc model , which is consistent with a @xmath274  mr nondetection of @xcite . among different hypotheses on the origin of hvcs ,",
    "our radiation harassment model is consistent with those that place these clouds in the galactic halo at distances @xmath275  kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "the possible scenarios include accretion of warm - hot intergalactic medium , stripped gas from disrupted galactic satellites , and gas - rich dm - dominated subhalos .",
    "recent detection of hvcs around m31 galaxy @xcite appears to be consistent with the above scenarios .",
    "one of predictions of our model which can be tested observationally is that at least some early - type dwarf satellites of the milky way and m31 should possess extended ionized ism , with the temperature @xmath276  k , and low number density .",
    "the total mass of the gas can be comparable to the mass of the stars .",

    "three available wide - field h@xmath117 surveys do not meet the above requirements : two complementing surveys , vtsshalpha ] ( virginia tech spectral - line survey , covers northern hemisphere , @xcite ) , and shassa ( southern h - alpha sky survey atlas , @xcite ) lack sensitivity ( 500  mr ) and velocity information , whereas wham ( covers northern hemisphere , @xcite ) having reasonably good sensitivity ( 50  mr ) and spectral resolution ( @xmath156  km  s@xmath7 ) , does not qualify because of the insufficient angular resolution ( @xmath155 ) and too narrow velocity coverage : @xmath287  km  s@xmath7",
    ". targeted h@xmath117 emission observations can do a much better job : observations with the sensitivity @xmath288  mr , angular and velocity resolutions @xmath289 and @xmath288  km  s@xmath7 , are almost routine nowadays @xcite . with new differential techniques , even lower emission levels of @xmath290  mr might be reached @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , that at least one of the dwarf galaxies in question , ngc  205 , has a tentative extended h@xmath117 emission detection in vtss ( field and07 ) .",
    "the central part of the dwarf has a surface brightness of @xmath171  r , and the fainter emission with the brightness of @xmath290  r appears to fill out all the stellar extent of the galaxy .",
    "these large values of the h@xmath117 flux , if confirmed , might require alternative explanations as to the source of ionization .",
    "future targeted h@xmath117 emission observations of ngc  205 are required to resolve the issue .",
    "we are grateful to frank bertoldi , andrea ferrara , and sergey silich for insightful discussions and numerous helpful suggestions .",
    "we also thank lisa young for providing the h  i data for ngc  205 . c.  c. acknowledges support from nserc ( canada ) and fcar ( qubec ) .",
