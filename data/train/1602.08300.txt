    "inflation is a very attractive cosmological paradigm .",
    "it solves the flatness and homogeneity problems of big bang cosmology , and could provide the seeds for the large - scale structure of the universe as well .",
    "inflation is usually considered to be driven by a scalar field called the inflaton which slow - rolls on its potential .",
    "the shape of the potential is carefully chosen in order to have both long enough inflation and density perturbations observed .",
    "starobinsky inflation  @xcite is one of the models consistent with observations of the cosmic microwave background by the planck satellite  @xcite .",
    "the inflaton potential may , however , be affected by other fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is considered that the potential of the chaotic inflation  @xcite could be suppressed by a scalar field with large amplitude due to a negative hubble - induced mass term . in particular",
    ", they showed that this effect renders the chaotic inflation with quadratic potential consistent with planck observations , otherwise marginally excluded  @xcite .",
    "it is then sensible to think the other way around : is there any situation in which this mechanism could affect the observationally preferable inflation model considerably ? or we may think about any observational evidence for other fields that have large amplitudes during such inflation in the future cmb experiments .    in this article , we consider the influence on the starobinsky inflation model by other fields with a large field amplitude due to a negative hubble - induced mass term .",
    "as well known , it is reasonable for a scalar field to have a negative hubble - induced mass term in supergravity  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the starobinsky inflation is realized in supergravity in many ways , such as in no - scale supergravity  @xcite or superconformal theory  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in the next section , we review the starobinsky model as a scalar - field - driven inflation . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce another scalar field whose coupling to the inflaton leads to a negative hubble - induced mass term in the starobinsky model , and we derive numerically the observables such as the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , in addition to the inflaton dynamics in sec .",
    "iv . in the same section",
    ", we obtain the constraints on model parameters by current cmb observations and consider the possibility of detecting such effects in future cmb experiments . in sec .",
    "v , we present that the model can be derived naturally in supergravity .",
    "we give our conclusion in sec .  vi .",
    "the starobinsky model  @xcite is obtained by generalization of einstein - hilbert action which contains an @xmath1 term as in    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a mass scale much less than the reduced planck mass @xmath4 ( = @xmath5  gev ) , and @xmath6 unit is adopted .",
    "it is equivalent to canonical gravity with a scalar field @xmath7 by conformal transformation . taking the transformation @xmath8 and the field redefinition @xmath9}$ ] , one obtains the redefined action @xmath10.\\ ] ] thus ,",
    "the potential of the inflaton @xmath11 is @xmath12 the spectral index of the curvature perturbation @xmath13 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 are described , respectively , by slow - roll parameters as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by    @xmath19    respectively .",
    "the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the inflaton @xmath11 .",
    "the number of @xmath20-folds of slow - roll inflation is calculated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the amplitudes of the inflaton at the time of @xmath24 @xmath25-folds and at the end of the inflation [ @xmath26 , respectively . in the starobinsky model , @xmath24=50 ( 60 )",
    "leads to @xmath13 = 0.961 ( 0.968 ) and @xmath14 = 0.0042 ( 0.0030 ) , which are favored by the planck result  @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce another scalar field @xmath27 , which obtains large amplitude due to a negative hubble - induced mass term . to illustrate how it may affect the inflaton dynamics , we assume the following coupling to the inflaton  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are positive coupling constants . as shown later , eq .",
    "( 7 ) is naturally obtained in supergravity . during inflation",
    ", @xmath27 stays at the minimum @xmath31^{\\frac{1}{2(q-1)}},\\ ] ] which changes as @xmath11 moves during inflation .",
    "therefore , the inflaton potential receives backreaction to be @xmath32 where the potential is suppressed at large @xmath11 compared to @xmath33 only .",
    "the slow - roll parameters are thus obtained as @xmath34 in the next section , we will calculate @xmath35 numerically , and estimate the spectral index @xmath36 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath37 .",
    "let us see how the spectral index @xmath13 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath38 will change in the presence of other fields with large amplitude . for given @xmath30 , we use the planck normalization of the primordial density perturbations @xcite , @xmath39 to determine @xmath3 .",
    "we show the estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for various @xmath30 in fig . 1 , together with @xmath30 dependences for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "we can see that our @xmath13 and @xmath14 do not differ from those in the pure starobinsky model for @xmath40 . as the amplitude of the @xmath27 field gets closer to the planck scale",
    "[ @xmath41 for @xmath42 , which corresponds to @xmath43 , @xmath14 quickly decreases , while @xmath13 stays in the current planck - favored region .",
    "lowering @xmath30 further , we have too small @xmath13 , which departs from the region allowed by the present planck observation for @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "notice that there is little dependence on @xmath46 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     current cmb observations such as the planck experiment can not tell if the starobinsky inflation is affected by the other field with a large amplitude for @xmath47 .",
    "future experiments may , however , reveal such effects of other fields for @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "the crucial steps toward this end are removals of the foreground and the lensing effect , and the forecasts on the capabilities of future cmb experiments to constrain the cosmological parameters are reported in refs .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite divides future experiments into two categories , pre- and post-2020 , and obtains the accuracies of the cosmological parameters to be determined as @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the pre-2020 experiments , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the post-2020 experiments .",
    "it seems difficult to distinguish between the starobinsky inflation with and without the effects of other fields by the pre-2020 experiments , but the post-2020 experiments may have the ability to confirm the existence of other fields with large amplitudes for @xmath48@xmath49 , especially due to the very accurate @xmath14 determination .",
    "the starobinsky model can be realized in supergravity . for example",
    ", it can be derived in superconformal theory , where the khler potential and superpotential are written as  @xcite @xmath54 respectively , where @xmath55 is the goldstino superfield , @xmath56 is the scalar field whose real part is the inflaton @xmath11 , and @xmath57 is a constant .",
    "another example utilizes no - scale supergravity , where the khler potential and superpotential are , respectively , given by  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath56 are complex scalar fields and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constants .",
    "the real part of @xmath56 can be regarded as the inflaton with the moduli @xmath59 being stabilized  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many light scalar fields may obtain large vacuum expectation values during inflation due to a negative hubble - induced mass in supergravity  @xcite , and eq .",
    "( 7 ) is naturally obtained .",
    "it can be achieved by a higher - order term in khler potential such as @xmath62 for superconformal theory or @xmath63 for the no - scale model , where @xmath64(@xmath651 ) is a coupling constant , and @xmath66 is a complex scalar field whose real part is @xmath27 .",
    "together with @xmath67 , we obtain eq .",
    "( 7 ) , with @xmath29 being @xmath68(1 ) .",
    "notice that , in no - scale supergravity , a negative hubble - induced mass term with @xmath69 can be realized by one - loop correction in the absence of the above higher - order term in khler potential  @xcite . in this case , there is less effect of other scalar fields with large amplitude on the inflaton potential and dynamics .",
    "we have considered how the inflaton dynamics in the starobinsky inflation will change because of another scalar field with large amplitude which is naturally obtained due to a negative hubble - induced mass .",
    "this effect suppresses the inflaton potential at large amplitudes , and we have found that the dynamics of the inflaton will be changed if the amplitude of such other field becomes close to the planck scale , @xmath70 for @xmath42 , or , in other words , @xmath71 . for @xmath72 , which is @xmath45 ,",
    "the inflaton potential is distorted too much , and it is no longer allowed by the current planck observation .",
    "we focus on the case for @xmath47 , where it is allowed at present . in that region , although the scalar spectral index @xmath13 does not change so much , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 quickly decreases for @xmath73 .",
    "since the post-2020 cmb experiments may reach @xmath74  @xcite , we may have a chance to confirm the presence of such other fields with large amplitude .    finally , we comment on the case in which the other scalar field is a flat direction in supersymmetry , which may result in the affleck - dine baryogenesis  @xcite",
    ". our result seems to show that the baryon asymmetry can be created almost maximally without affecting the dynamics of the starobinsky inflation .",
