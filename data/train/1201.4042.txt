    "in the last years a phenomenon that has attracted the attention of solar physicists is the discovery of transverse oscillations of coronal loops observed in euv wavelengths ( @xmath1  ) with trace in @xmath2 .",
    "the oscillatory amplitude and period are of the order of a few mm and a few min , respectively , and one of the most interesting features of these oscillations is that their amplitude decreases quickly with time , typically in a few periods .",
    "some examples of this oscillatory phenomenon , namely flare - excited transversal oscillations , were reported by @xcite , more recently by @xcite , and @xcite , see @xcite and @xcite for an extensive overview and analysis of transversal flare - excited coronal loop oscillations .",
    "the first theoretical studies of the modes of oscillation of coronal flux tubes modeled as straight magnetic cylinders were done by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later , flare - generated transverse oscillations were interpreted as fast kink eigenmode oscillations of straight cylindrical tubes @xcite . in the context of curved coronal magnetic structures",
    ", @xcite investigated the continuous spectrum of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . @xcite and @xcite derived the spectrum of modes in potential and non - potential arcades .",
    "more complex configurations , such as sheared magnetic arcades in the zero plasma-@xmath0 limit , have been studied by @xcite .",
    "other authors have studied eigenmodes in curved configurations with density enhancements that represent coronal loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the corona is a highly inhomogeneous and structured medium complicates the theoretical description of mhd waves and it is believed that this could be the underlying cause of the observed wave damping .",
    "several mechanisms of wave damping have been proposed , the most popular being phase mixing @xcite , resonant absorption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) and more recently wave leakage by tunneling @xcite .",
    "although normal modes should be seen as the building blocks to interpret coronal loop oscillations they do not represent the whole picture , but their study provides a basis for understanding the dynamics of the system . to have a more accurate description ,",
    "the time - dependent problem needs to be analyzed . using this method",

    "the aim of this work is to examine two physical mechanisms involved in the fast attenuation of the observed vertical coronal loop oscillations .",
    "previous studies by @xcite have considered the damping of vertical oscillations by wave leakage in a coronal loop embedded in a curved configuration . when propagation is constrained to the plane of the structure , these authors find that wave leakage produces a strong damping and that the ratio of the damping time to the period is , in some cases , much shorter than the observed values . on the other hand ,",
    "damping by resonant absorption , caused by the inhomogeneity of the medium , has mainly been studied in single magnetic slabs @xcite and in single magnetic cylinders @xcite , for example .",
    "nevertheless , more complex equilibrium models have also been considered @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently considered the coupling of fast and alfvn modes in a potential coronal arcade with three - dimensional propagation of perturbations .",
    "this study shows that because of the inclusion of perpendicular propagation fast wave energy can easily be converted into alfvn wave energy at given magnetic surfaces by means of resonant coupling .",
    "our analysis aims at extending the model by @xcite by including a density enhancement in a curved magnetic configuration in order to study how three - dimensional propagation affects the efficiency of the damping of vertical loop oscillations by wave leakage and how the inhomogeneity of the corona can produce coupling of modes and energy transfer .",

    "\\label{eq : totalenergy}\\ ] ]    the total energy density in a spatial domain , @xmath80 , of the @xmath3-plane can be computed from the spatial integration of @xmath81 , @xmath82 in our plots this quantity is normalized by dividing it by the initial energy density over the whole numerical domain , @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ky0]b shows the total energy density integrated over the full domain , the interior of the loop , and the external region .",
    "we can see that the loop is unable to trap wave energy and that , after a little more than @xmath84 , it has already transferred all its energy to the outside medium .",
    "after this time , the wave energy outside the loop equals the energy in the full domain .",
    "because of this wave leakage , the total energy of the system continuously decreases and when the last leaky waves carrying a non - negligible amount of energy reach the domain boundaries ( i.e. at @xmath85 ) , it is practically zero ; see also the animation of figure  [ fig : movies1 ] .",
    "these results differ from what is obtained in a line - tied straight slab model of a coronal loop @xcite , in which the kink mode of the loop remains oscillating after the initial leaky phase , since the density enhancement is able to trap part of the energy of the initial perturbation .",
    "such as was already pointed out by @xcite , the magnetic field line curvature produces damping by wave leakage and the energy deposited initially in the loop is simply radiated as a combination of leaky modes , and thus no trapped solutions are found .",
    "@xcite showed that in a toroidal loop structure wave leakage is much less effective , that in slab geometry .",
    "following the same idea , @xcite used a simple three - dimensional straight slab model to demonstrate that in the case of a slab , introducing oblique propagation increases the spatial confinement of the kink mode around the loop . @xcite",
    "have also shown that a cylindrical tube is a more efficient wave guide than the slab model , and less energy is allowed to leak . when a potential arcade is used as the equilibrium structure",
    ", the oblique propagation of the slab corresponds to perpendicular propagation , which means the introduction of the @xmath46 wave number .",
    "if the previous results for the kink mode with oblique propagation in a coronal slab are also valid in the present loop configuration , we expect that an initial perturbation will excite both leaky waves ( that will leave the system in a similar manner as found in   [ sect : wave leakage ] ) and trapped modes ( that will retain energy in the system ) .",
    "a comment about the term `` trapped '' mode used in this paper is in order . in our plasma configuration",
    "the local cut - off frequency depends on position because of the alfvn speed inhomogeneity and the inclusion of perpendicular wave propagation . for this reason ,",
    "an eigenfunction that is evanescent in a certain region can change its character to propagating in another part of the system , and so wave energy leakage can arise .",
    "for this reason we warn that modes termed `` trapped '' here may actually loose energy by this mechanism .",

    "the temporal evolution of the normal and perpendicular velocity components ( see the animations accompanying the top panel of figure  [ fig : movies2 ] ) illustrate that there are important differences compared to the case @xmath88 ( figure  [ fig : movies1 ] ) .",
    "first of all , some of the energy contained in the initial perturbation goes to the perpendicular variables because @xmath89 implies that the perturbed perpendicular components ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) are no longer independent of the normal and parallel ones ( @xmath41 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ) .",
    "in addition , we have just discussed that for @xmath88 most energy has left the system at @xmath85 . for @xmath87 , however , it is apparent that some energy remains in the loop and part of the arcade above it for much longer times .",
    "this is interpreted as a signature of the excitation of one or more trapped modes of the system .",
    "we next substantiate this claim with a careful inspection of @xmath41 .",
    "we consider the temporal variation of the normal velocity component near the loop center ( figure  [ fig : vnky5]a ) .",
    "it displays two distinct behaviors : for @xmath90 very short periods are prominent .",
    "they correspond to leaky modes , that propagate quickly away from the loop .",
    "after this leaky phase all that remains is a gentle , damped oscillation .",
    "this damping will be later discussed in detail , but let us mention that it is milder than that of the @xmath88 case ( figure  [ fig : ky0]a ) .",
    "the power spectrum of the @xmath41 signal ( figure  [ fig : vnky5]b ) shows two clear peaks that , according to the interpretation in the previous paragraph , simply reflect the power contained in two trapped modes excited by the initial perturbation .",
    "an evidence of this would be the presence of power peaks at nearly the same frequency in neighboring points . to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we consider @xmath41 as a function of @xmath91 for @xmath77 and different values of @xmath18 , compute their power spectra and stack them in a contour plot ( figure  [ fig : vnky5]c ) .",
    "the result is the presence of significant power at two horizontal contours whose frequencies coincide with those found in figure  [ fig : vnky5]b , each of them with its characteristic range of heights . from figure",

    "a relevant issue is that the alfvn frequency varies in each of these two ranges of magnetic surfaces and so the resulting alfvn oscillations soon become out of phase .",
    "this phase mixing creates small spatial scales that lead to the numerical dissipation of energy whose importance will next become clear .",

    "the first of these three quantities presents three phases : for @xmath90 the total energy in the whole system decreases rapidly because of the emission of leaky waves .",
    "then , for @xmath111 the rate of energy decrease is slower , and for @xmath112 it becomes stronger again . to understand the last two phases one must bear in mind the energy loss by the numerical dissipation of alfvn waves . during the phase @xmath111",
    "there is a substantial amount of energy in the loop ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : energiesky5]a ) that is slowly transferred to the surrounding medium ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : energiesky5]a ) .",
    "we know that this process is caused by resonant absorption , by which the energy that could not leak in the initial phase is transferred to the two resonant positions .",
    "after @xmath113 almost all the energy in the trapped modes has been given to alfvn modes , which implies that these modes can not longer `` feed '' from their previous energy `` reservoir '' .",
    "as a result , the numerical dissipation of phase - mixed alfvn waves proceeds at a faster pace .",
    "figure  [ fig : energiesky5]b provides support to this interpretation : at @xmath85 almost all the energy has been converted from the `` fast''-like perturbations to the alfvnic ones , but @xmath114 does not become negligible until @xmath115 .",

    "figure  [ fig : energiesky60]b indicates that while some energy is transferred from the first to the second one , on the long term the `` fast '' components retain a larger proportion of energy .",
    "the total energy of the system presents a decay in time that , unlike to that described in   [ sect : wave coupling ] , is constant during the whole simulation .",
    "there are two reasons for this difference : first , the loop is such a good wave guide for transverse oscillations when @xmath119 that very little wave energy is carried out of the system by leaky waves .",
    "then , the initial leaky phase of figure  [ fig : energiesky5 ] is not found in figure  [ fig : energiesky60 ] .",
    "second , for @xmath87 resonant absorption brings energy to alfvnic motions at large heights , where the spatial mesh is coarser .",
    "this enhances numerical dissipation of alfvn waves , which results in a strong wave damping . for @xmath119 , however , all wave energy is retained at small heights , where the spatial mesh is denser .",

    "the first of these two signals is taken inside the loop , at its top boundary , while the second signal is gathered at one of the resonant positions .",
    "their amplitude aside , these two signals are different in that the first one has an appreciable amplitude just after the initial leaky phase ( i.e. for @xmath76 ) , whereas the second one is initially negligible and only after @xmath85 starts to grow , at a rate larger than that of its counterpart inside the loop . to understand these two behaviors",

    "in this paper we have studied the temporal evolution of fast and alfvn waves in a curved coronal loop embedded in a magnetic potential arcade , in order to asses the relevance of three - dimensional propagation of perturbations on the damping of vertical loop oscillations by wave leakage and resonant absorption .",

    "the amount of energy trapped by the structure increases for increasing values of the perpendicular wave number .",
    "second , the inclusion of the perpendicular wave number in a inhomogeneous corona produces the resonant coupling between fast and alfvn modes at those positions where the trapped mode frequency matches that of alfvn waves .",
    "this resonant coupling produces the transfer of energy from the fast wave components to alfvnic oscillations . in our model",
    "the loop boundary is sharp and so there is no smooth density transition that allows resonant absorption to happen in this position .",
