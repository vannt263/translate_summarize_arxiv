    "unfortunately , our observations do not cover the full extent of this secondary tail , as visible for instance in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "additional observations in the south - west will thus be critical for a detailed investigation of the properties of the secondary tail .",
    "near the disk , embedded within the h@xmath3  emission of this secondary tail , there are few bright h@xmath3  knots , which @xcite identified as hii regions .",
    "in contrast to the more diffuse emission , these bright hii regions ( and in particular the southernmost clump ) do not appear to be tightly correlated with the x - ray flux , hinting to a different physical origin of the emission in compact regions compared to the diffuse emission in the tails .",
    "our observations , in agreement with previous studies , point to ram - pressure stripping as the primary mechanism of gas removal .",
    "indeed , we note how the stellar velocity field in figure [ fig : stkin ] exhibits an ordered velocity gradient along the major axis , as expected for a nearly edge - on rotating disk .",
    "compared to the isophotes measured on an image extracted from the datacube in the wavelength range @xmath90 , the measured velocity field appears to be symmetric relative to the major axis and it is also well - centered at the optical location of eso137@xmath0001 . this ordered motion and an extremely disturbed morphology of the ism compared to unperturbed",
    "isophotes support the conclusion of earlier studies that ram - pressure stripping is responsible for the gas ablation .",
    "indeed , ram - pressure stripping produces only subtle transformations in the stellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which largely retain memory of the original morphology and kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one may however argue that the velocity map in figure [ fig : stkin ] suggests the presence of small perturbations in the velocity field in the northern part of the stellar disk . however , we are more cautious in interpreting these features that are detected only in regions of low surface brightness and in proximity to two bright foreground stars , which may contaminate our measurement of the velocity fields at these locations .",
    "our observations , combined with the available hst imaging ( see figure [ fig : fov ] ) , support a picture in which the galaxy suffered from ram pressure in the disk outskirts in the past , and it is still being ablated of its gas from the innermost regions . through models in which the efficiency of ram - pressure stripping depends on both gas density and galactocentric radius , as shown for example in figure 8 by @xcite , we can establish a correspondence between the spatial location of the h@xmath3  emitting gas and the time at which this gas was stripped . moreover , lower density material in the less - bound outskirts of eso137@xmath0001  is stripped more easily at earlier times .",
    "this means that material originating from the disk outskirts traces a more rapid stripping process which will come to an end before the stripping from the nucleus .",
    "our map shows that the h@xmath3  bright knots that are offset from the primary tail are being stripped from the northern and southern parts of the disk , respectively . at these large galactocentric radii",
    ", there is no evidence of h@xmath3  emitting gas inside the stellar disk of eso137@xmath0001  to our sensitivity limit .",
    "thus , ram pressure has already cleared the galaxy ism in these less - bound regions .",
    "conversely , the galaxy ism is still present in the inner @xmath91 kpc of eso137@xmath0001   ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this material is still being stripped , feeding the primary tail .",
    "we therefore conclude that the primary tail originates from the inner regions of eso137@xmath0001  and not from the northern trailing arm , as suggested by the earlier analysis of h@xmath3  narrow - band imaging @xcite .",
    "this outside - in stripping process offers a natural explanation for the different morphology of the primary h@xmath3  tail compared to the two complexes of h@xmath3  bright clumps in the north and south direction .",
    "we speculate that the diffuse gas from the outer disk was removed in the past and it has already mixed with the hot ambient medium downstream . as a consequence , we are now witnessing only the last episode of stripping of the densest clumps of gas , which trace the location of the older secondary tails .",
    "this is also a plausible explanation for why the primary h@xmath3  tail is narrow compared to the optical disk @xcite .",
    "originally , there may have been a single tail , fed by material stripped at all galactocentric radii , differently than what we see today .",
    "a qualitative picture for how an inside - out stripping affects the morphology of the tail can be seen , for instance , in the right panels of figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the gas and stellar kinematics offers additional insight into how ram - pressure stripping occurs in eso137@xmath0001  and how this galaxy moves as it approaches the center of the cluster .",
    "the h@xmath3  map shows that eso137@xmath0001  is moving towards the center the norma cluster on a projected orbit with position angle of @xmath92 .",
    "the gas radial velocity , as traced by h@xmath3  ( figure [ fig : vel ] ) , reveals no evident gradient along the primary tail , implying that the motion occurs in the plane of the sky .",
    "conversely , a clear velocity gradient is seen in the direction parallel to the galaxy major axis , perpendicular to the tail .",
    "this velocity pattern was already observed by @xcite who studied selected hii regions with gemini / gmos spectroscopy .",
    "the unprecedented quality of the muse datacube , however , dramatically improves the fidelity with which the gas kinematics of eso137@xmath0001  is traced , also within the diffuse component .",
    "our observations confirm that eso137@xmath0001  is approaching the cluster center on a nearly - radial orbit , with no significant tangential velocity component .",
    "the stripped gas retains a remarkable degree of coherence in velocity to @xmath93 kpc downstream , which is originally imprinted by the rotation curve of the stellar disk .",

    "the infall velocity @xmath100 is unknown from direct observations , but we can combine several pieces of evidence to conclude that eso137@xmath0001is fast moving towards the center of the cluster .",
    "given the cluster velocity dispersion , which @xcite measured as @xmath101  @xmath6 , one could derive an approximate estimate for the orbital velocity of eso137@xmath0001  as @xmath102@xmath6 .",
    "however , the study of @xcite suggests that a much higher velocity @xmath103  @xmath6  is needed for an orbit that crosses the cluster virial radius .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic calculations are required to link the infall velocity to the disturbances seen in eso137@xmath0001 , but here we simply note that such a high velocity is qualitatively in line with cases of extreme ram pressure . for eso137@xmath0001",
    ", gas is ablated even from the most bound regions of the galaxy potential well , implying high ram pressure . indeed ,",
    "@xcite estimates that during its interaction with the dense icm , with electron densities of @xmath104 @xcite , eso137@xmath0001   can suffer from ram pressure up to a peak of @xmath105 for their assumed velocity .",
    "as noted , a coherent radial velocity is visible on scales of at least @xmath106kpc from the galaxy center along the tail . besides , the h@xmath3  emitting gas exhibits a modest degree of turbulent motion on similar scales , as seen from the velocity dispersion map ( figure [ fig : sig ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the gas has a velocity dispersion @xmath107@xmath6 , in qualitative agreement with the narrow co line profiles shown by @xcite .",
    "a lower velocity dispersion ( @xmath108@xmath6 ) is seen in the bright h@xmath3  knots which are offset from the primary tail , as expected for a colder medium which hosts sites of ongoing star formation . beyond @xmath4kpc from the galaxy position , a higher degree of velocity dispersion can be seen , with typical values above @xmath109@xmath6  and peaks exceeding @xmath110@xmath6 .",
    "we need to be more cautious in interpreting kinematics within field b , due to the lower signal - to - noise of our observations .",
    "nevertheless , a progressively higher velocity dispersion moving far from the eso137@xmath0001  disk along the tail was also noted by @xcite who found larger fwhm and more complex line profiles in their co observations at larger distances from the disk .",
    "moreover , gaussian fits to coarsely binned data with higher @xmath60 show larger velocity widths in the outer tail , consistently with the measurements presented in figure [ fig : sig ] . for an infall velocity @xmath103  @xmath6 , gas lying at @xmath111kpc from the eso137@xmath0001  disk has been stripped no less than @xmath112myr ago , assuming instantaneous acceleration of the removed material to the icm velocity .",
    "thus , our observations suggest that substantial turbulence due to fluid instabilities or residual rotational velocity in the stripped gas grows on timescales of at least @xmath112myr .",
    "however , both results of numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations @xcite reveal that the stripped gas is not accelerated to orbital velocity instantaneously , and that the denser medium does not typically reach the infall velocity . based on these results ,",
    "the inferred timescale should be regarded as a conservative lower limit to the growth of instabilities in the tail .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this laminar flow persists despite the shear between the ambient icm and the h@xmath3  emitting , perhaps due to the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "finally , we can appeal to the observed coherence to argue that the relative velocity @xmath113 between the gas tail and the galaxy likely exceeds the galaxy circular velocity @xmath114 .",
    "our argument starts by noting that the tail is confined by the ambient icm .",
    "if that were not the case , in the absence of a restoring centripetal force , material ablated from the disk at a radius @xmath115 where the disk circular velocity is @xmath116 would leave on a tangential orbit , causing the tail to flare . here",
    ", @xmath117 is the disk inclination angle and @xmath118 is the observed line of sight velocity .",
    "unsurprisingly , this is not what we observe , as the gas in the tail is confined by the ambient icm pressure .    in presence of a confining medium , a second velocity component perpendicular to",
    "the galaxy orbital motion contributes to the shear between the tail and the icm .",
    "however , we noted how the tail retains a line - of - sight velocity similar to the disk rotation , which suggests that the tail can not be spinning at higher velocity compared to the velocity of the gas in the tail relative to the galaxy . in a simple geometry , a parcel of gas that leaves the disk with velocity @xmath114 rotates by an angle @xmath119 by the time it has been displaced to a distance @xmath120 with velocity @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the lack of substantial turbulence leads us to conclude that the angle @xmath121 is likely small , which is to say that @xmath122 and there are no significant instabilities due to the disk rotation that grow substantially at the interface between the warm gas in the tail and the hot icm .",
    "given that @xmath123 in the outer disk , and that most likely @xmath124 , we also conclude that @xmath125 , i.e. the galaxy is fast moving in the plane of the sky .    clearly , this quite simple discussion should be verified with detailed hydrodynamic simulations designed to reproduce the properties of eso137@xmath0001 , and that model the interaction of the warm / hot components , the effect of hydrodynamic and thermal instabilities , and the role of magnetic fields .",
    "all these quantities are in fact encoded in the phenomenology revealed by our muse observations .",
    "in this paper we have presented muse science verification observations of the central disk and gaseous tail of eso137@xmath0001 , a spiral galaxy infalling at high velocity on a nearly - radial orbit towards the center of the massive norma cluster at @xmath1 . during its encounter with the icm , eso137@xmath0001  experiences extreme ram - pressure stripping , which gives rise to an extended tail that has been detected at multiple wavelengths , from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "the new capabilities of muse , with its large field of view , extended wavelength coverage , and high throughput , have allowed us to map the h@xmath3  emitting gas inside eso137@xmath0001  and its tail to surface brightness limits of @xmath84 erg  s@xmath37  @xmath38  arcsec@xmath39 , and to reconstruct the stellar kinematics traced by the ca   triplet .",
    "these new data offer an unprecedented view of eso137@xmath0001  and its tail , which is traced in h@xmath3   emission to beyond 30 kpc .",
    "these observations allow us to conclude that the ism of this galaxy suffered and it is still suffering from ram - pressure stripping at different galactocentric radii : the less bound material has been completely stripped from the outer disk , giving rise to clumpy and irregular tails , while the galaxy center still contains part of the original ism which feeds the primary h@xmath3  tail , aligned with the x - ray emission .",
    "the stripped gas retains the original rotation velocity of the stellar disk , but exhibits a remarkable degree of coherence in velocity space for @xmath4kpc downstream .",
    "beyond @xmath4kpc from the galaxy disk along the tail , a greater degree of turbulence is seen , with peak velocity dispersion @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "these pieces of evidence are indicative that the galaxy is fast moving in the plane of sky , with infall velocity greater than the rotational velocity . for an infall velocity of @xmath126  @xmath6 , indicated by the orbital study of @xcite ,",
    "material at @xmath4kpc has been stripped no less than @xmath112myr ago , suggesting that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs on comparable , or most likely , longer timescales . finally , the ordered stellar rotation combined with regular isophotes in the disk rules out gravitational interactions as the main process responsible for the stripping .",
    "this work offers only a first glimpse of the rich muse datacube , in which we detect multiple transitions including [ oiii ] , [ oi ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , h@xmath127 in emission , as well as absorption lines within the stellar disk , most notably ca   and h@xmath3 .",
    "all these transitions will allow us to better constrain the physical properties of the disk and tail of eso137@xmath0001 , including the properties of the bow shock and the interaction between the stripped warm ism and the hot x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "furthermore , a detailed comparison of these observations with results of numerical simulations will be crucial to establish the hydrodynamic and thermal properties of the gas which is subject to ram - pressure stripping , including the role of instabilities and magnetic fields .",
    "these studies will be presented in future papers of this series .",
    "our work demonstrates the terrific potential that muse and future large field - of - view ifus on 8 - 10 m class telescopes have in studying ram - pressure stripping , building on earlier ifu studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by targeting galaxies like eso137@xmath0001  in which ram pressure is near to its maximum",
    ", these observations will provide key information on how gas is ablated from all galactocentric radii , how the diffuse and dense ism components interact and mix with the ambient icm , and on what timescales star formation responds to this gas removal .",
    "once applied to more typical cluster galaxies , results from these detailed analyses will offer a comprehensive view of how ram pressure affects the build - up of the observed red sequence in rich clusters . in turn , this will help to disentangle the role of environment from the role of internal processes in shaping the color bimodality seen in the densest regions of the universe .",
