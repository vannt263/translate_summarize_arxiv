    "security is one of the most important considerations in transmission of information from one user to another .",
    "it involves confidentiality , integrity , authentication and non - repudiation @xcite .",
    "we will be concerned about confidentiality .",
    "this guarantees that the legitimate users successfully receive the information intended for them while any eavesdropper is not able to interpret this information .",
    "we will be concerned with the eavesdroppers who are passive attackers , e.g. , they attempt to interpret the transmitted information without injecting any new information or trying to modify the information transmitted .    traditional techniques to achieve confidentiality in this setup",
    "are based on cryptographic encryption ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however now , information theoretical security is also being actively studied ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this does not require the secret / public keys used in cryptographic techniques .",
    "key management , especially for wireless channels can be very challenging . also , information theoretic security unlike the cryptography based techniques can provide provably secure communication .",
    "information theoretic security can also be used in a system in addition to cryptographic techniques to add additional layers of protection to the information transmission or to achieve key agreement and/or distribution .",
    "the information theoretic approach for secrecy systems was first investigated by shannon @xcite in 1949 .",
    "wyner @xcite considers communicating a secret over a wiretap channel in the form of degraded broadcast channels , without using a key .",
    "wyner s work was in turn extended by leung and hellman @xcite to the gaussian channel .",
    "csiszr and krner @xcite considers a general discrete memoryless broadcast channel , and shows that the secrecy capacity is positive if the main channel to the intended user is more capable than of the eavesdropper , and zero if the wiretapper s channel is less noisy .",
    "secrecy capacity of mimo ( multiple input multiple output ) channels was obtained in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "an artificial noise concept is proposed for mimo channels to enhance the secrecy rate even when the eavesdropper s channel is better than the main channel . in @xcite ,",
    "this result has been extended to the case where no csi of the eavesdropper is available .",
    "the fading channel is studied in @xcite where power allocation schemes without csi of the eavesdropper s channel to the transmitter are also obtained . in @xcite , a wire - tap channel with slow fading",
    "is studied where an outage analysis with full csi of the eavesdropper and imperfect csi of the eavesdropper is performed .",
    "practical codes for the single user wire - tap channel were first reported in @xcite .",
    "liang et al.@xcite have studied a broadcast channel with a wire - tapper .",
    "interference channels with confidential messages are studied in @xcite .",
    "the first results in information theoretic security for a multiple access channel ( mac ) were obtained in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "each user treats the other as an eavesdropper while in @xcite , the eavesdropper is at the receiving end . in @xcite , yener and tekin propose a technique called cooperative jamming in which a user that is not transmitting , can send a jamming signal so that the eavesdropper is more confused .",
    "this significantly improves the secrecy rate region .",
    "a fading mac was also studied by yener and tekin @xcite , where they assume that the csi of the eavesdropper s channel is perfectly known at the transmitting users . in @xcite ,",
    "bassily and ulukus have proposed ergodic secret alignment to further improve the secrecy sum - rate region of the mac with an eavesdropper .    in this paper , we consider a fading mac - wt assuming no csi of the eavesdropper at the transmitting users .",
    "since the eavesdropper may not transmit any signal ( it is passive ) , the transmitters often will not know its channel .",
    "we obtain a power control scheme that maximizes the sum secrecy rate and then also employ cooperative jamming over this scheme .",
    "it will be shown that cooperative jamming can significantly increase the secrecy rate . but these policies are difficult to compute .",
    "thus , next we consider a computationally simpler on / off power control policy .",
    "we obtain its thresholds to maximize the secrecy sum - rate .",
    "finally , we also incorporate cooperative jamming over this power control policy . with this , at high snr , the secrecy sum - rate exceeds the sum - rate when csi of the eavesdropper is perfectly known at the transmitter but the cooperative jamming is not used .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we define the channel model and state the problem . in section iii , we obtain the power control policy with and without cooperative jamming .",
    "section iv discusses on / off power control policy with and without cooperative jamming . in section",
    "v , we compare the different policies numerically .",
    "finally in section vi , we conclude this paper and discuss the future work .",
    "we consider a system with two users who want to communicate over a fading mac to a legitimate receiver .",
    "there is also an eavesdropper who is trying to get access to the output received by the legitimate receiver .",
    "transmitter @xmath0 chooses message @xmath1 for transmission from a set @xmath2 with uniform distribution .",
    "these messages are encoded into @xmath3 using @xmath4 codes .",
    "the legitimate receiver gets @xmath5 and the eavesdropper gets @xmath6 at time @xmath7 . the decoder at the legitimate receiver estimates the transmitted message as @xmath8 from @xmath9 .",
    "the legitimate receiver should receive the message reliably while the eavesdropper should not be able to decode it .",
    "it is assumed that the legitimate receiver as well as the eavesdropper know the codebooks .",
    "the channel model can be mathematically represented as : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the complex channel gains from the transmitter @xmath13 to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper respectively .",
    "also @xmath14 and @xmath15 are complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) each with circularly symmetric independent components distributed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is gaussian distribution with mean @xmath18 and variance @xmath19 . also we define @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are independent , identically distributed ( iid ) , and that each sequence is independent of the other ( thus the channels experience flat , fast fading ) .",
    "we also assume the power constraints : @xmath25    the equivocation rate used in this paper is as defined in @xcite .",
    "we use collective secrecy constraint to take the multi - access nature of the channel into account .",
    "define + @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 . for each @xmath29",
    "we need codebooks such that the average probability of error to the legitimate receiver goes to zero and @xmath30 as @xmath31 for each @xmath32 . also let @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are exponentially distributed .",
    "then from @xcite , if the csi @xmath36 are known at both the transmitters at time @xmath7 , the secrecy rate region for this case is : @xmath37^{+}\\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ]    @xmath38^{+}\\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ]    @xmath39^{+}\\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the transmit powers satisfying the constraint ( 3)and gaussian signalling is used .    in @xcite , the optimal power allocation policy which maximizes",
    "the sum secrecy rate ( 7 ) has been found . in this paper",
    ", we extend this result to the case when the csi of the legitimate receiver is known but the csi of the eavesdropper may not be known at the transmitter ; only the distribution is known .",
    "since we are assuming a passive eavesdropper , this will often be a more reasonable assumption , i.e. , there is no transmission from the eavesdropper to the transmitters for them to estimate its channel .",
    "in this section we consider power control which maximizes the sum secrecy rate when only the main channel ( to the legitimate user ) csi is known at the transmitters .",
    "let @xmath42 be the power used by a policy when the main channel gain is @xmath43 .",
    "of course , the policy should satisfy the average power constraint ( [ p_cons ] ) .",
    "we need the following notation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the channel state ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 is the power used .",
    "the following theorem can be proved as in @xcite .",
    "+    for a given power control policy @xmath49 , the following secrecy sum - rate @xmath50^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ] is achievable .",
    "the policy that maximizes ( [ rs_nocsi ] ) is not available in closed form , but can be numerically computed ( see appendix ) .",
    "an example will be provided in section vi .",
    "we will also consider a simpler on / off power control policy which was employed in @xcite for a single user case .",
    "next we consider power control with cooperative jamming .",
    "the power policy obtained in the last section depends on @xmath51 .",
    "if both the main channels @xmath52 and @xmath53 are good , both the transmitters send their coded symbols .",
    "if a transmitter s channel is bad , it may not . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "it is suggested that when a transmitter is not sending its data , it can help the other user by jamming the channel to the eavesdropper .",
    "we extend their result to our set - up .",
    "let @xmath54 , be the power control policy when the users are transmitting and @xmath55 , be the power control policy when the users are jamming . to satisfy ( 3 ) , we need @xmath56 \\leq \\bar{p_{k}},~k=1,2.\\ ] ] then we have the following theorem +    with the above power control policies secrecy sum - rate    @xmath57^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ] is achievable .",
    "the proof of this theorem is given in appendix a.1    we will obtain the power control policy that maximizes the sum rate in the appendix .",
    "we will see in section vi that cooperative jamming can significantly improve the sum - rate .",
    "we also propose a simple on / off power control policy with cooperative jamming .",
    "the policy obtained in section iii can be computed only numerically and its structure is not known .",
    "the following on / off policy is easier to compute and is intuitive :    user @xmath13 transmits with a constant power @xmath58 if @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an appropriate threshold .",
    "hence the following cases arise :    1 .",
    "h@xmath61 , h@xmath62 : both transmit ; 2 .",
    "h@xmath61 , h@xmath63 : user-1 transmits ; 3 .",
    "h@xmath64 , h@xmath62 : user-2 transmits ; 4 .",
    "h@xmath64 , h@xmath63 : no user transmits .    from average power constraint we get : @xmath65 and @xmath66 let @xmath67 and @xmath68    the secrecy sum - rate by this policy is given by    @xmath69^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    @xmath70^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    @xmath71^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 is the indicator function of set a.    when @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath0 have exponential distributions with independent components , with joint density of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively given as : @xmath75 then @xmath76    we numerically obtain the secrecy sum - rate for thresholds @xmath77 and @xmath78 which maximize sum - rate ( [ r1_onoff ] ) .",
    "cooperative jamming in section iii b has been found to increase the sum - rate substantially ( see fig 1 below ) .",
    "therefore , we now use it with the on / off policy studied in section iv . a user",
    "when not transmitting its data jams the channel for the eavesdropper .",
    "also it transmits with different powers taking into account the channel gain of the other user .",
    "the following cases arise : +    1 .",
    "h@xmath61 , h@xmath62 : both transmit with power @xmath79 , @xmath80 ; 2 .",
    "h@xmath61 , h@xmath63 : user-1 transmits with power @xmath81 , user-2 jams with power @xmath82 ; 3 .",
    "h@xmath64 , h@xmath62 : user-2 transmits with power @xmath83 , user-1 jams with power @xmath84 ; 4 .",
    "h@xmath64 , h@xmath63 : none transmits or jams .    the powers and the thresholds in the above scheme are chosen to satisfy the average power constraints .    with this power control scheme ,",
    "the secrecy sum - rate is given by :    @xmath85^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    @xmath86^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    @xmath87^{+}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    when @xmath88 and @xmath89 have rayleigh distribution + @xmath90 @xmath91",
    "in this section , we compare the sum rates obtained via the different power control schemes proposed in this paper .",
    "the receiver s awgn noise has variance 1 .",
    "the fading for each channel is rayleigh distributed with parameters @xmath92 .",
    "the sum rates are plotted in fig.1 for different powers @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that cooperative jamming substantially improves the sum - rate ( up to 75% ) .",
    "of course , for each case knowledge of the eavesdropper s csi at the transmitter improves the sum - rate . at high snr",
    ", the cooperative jamming can provide sum - rate without csi higher than the full csi case without cooperative jamming . also , optimal on / off power control is sufficient to recover most of the sum rate achievable by a policy ( for no eavesdropper s csi and no jamming , on /",
    "off provides sum - rate very close to the optimal algorithm in that scenario ) .",
    "in this paper , we provide achievable secrecy sum - rate in a fading mac with an eavesdropper when the eavesdropper s channel is not known to the transmitter .",
    "we obtain the power controls that optimize the secrecy sum - rate .",
    "we also obtain the power control when cooperative jamming is also employed .",
    "it is shown that cooperative jamming can substantially improve the secrecy sum - rates .",
    "we , then , obtain more easily computable on / off power control schemes which provide secrecy sum - rates close to the optimal .",
    "it is shown that via these techniques , one can recover most of the secrecy sum - rate achievable with the perfect knowledge of the csi of the eavesdropper .    for future work one can consider the schemes when partial csi of the legitimate receiver s channel is available at the transmitter .",
    "we sketch the outline of proof for sum - rate only , the proof of single user rate follows on the similar lines .",
    "we quantize @xmath94 and @xmath95 into uniform bins as defined in @xcite ,",
    "i.e @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 , h_{2}\\in [ 0,m_{2}^{h } ] , g_{1}\\in [ 0,m_{1}^{g } ] $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] + also let + @xmath100=\\{*h*:@xmath101 } + @xmath102=\\{*g*:@xmath103 } also we define @xmath104 = @xmath105 + we say that a channel is in state @xmath106if ( * h*,*g*)@xmath107 we define quantized power control policy as + @xmath108    it can be easily shown that ( [ p_cons_opt ] ) implies that ( [ new_power ] ) also satisfies power constraint .",
    "now for a particular quantized state , we have a gaussian mac - wt whose rate region is characterized in @xcite . in particular , the sum - rate is bounded as : + @xmath109^{+}\\ ] ] now the number of times the channel is in state @xmath106 + @xmath110 now let r@xmath111 = r@xmath112 + r@xmath113 , the following rate is achievable + @xmath114 @xmath115    due lack of space we omit some steps , one can easily prove also that average probabililty of error also vanishes i.e + @xmath116    now one can show that the optimal power control policy given in theorem 1 achives this sum - rate r@xmath117 given by + r@xmath117= + @xmath118^{+}\\phi(\\textbf{h})d\\textbf{h}\\ ] ] for that we need to show that for a given  @xmath119  @xmath120 s.t + @xmath121    one can easily show the r@xmath117 is finite . then by invoking dominated convergence theorem along the same lines as done in @xcite the achievability of sum - rate with the optimal power control policy is proved .",
    "the proof follows along the same lines as in theorem 1 since from @xcite we know that when full csi of eve s channel is known , the optimal power control policy is that one user can either transmit or jam but not both at a time .",
    "hence we can use same arguments as in proof of theorem 1 to prove the achievability of secrecy sum - rate , which we omit here due to lack of space .",
    "we provide the optimal power control policy without cooperative jamming for rayleigh fading .",
    "similarly one can obtain the powers for other distributions .",
    "let @xmath122 and @xmath123 denote the densities of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively . for rayleigh",
