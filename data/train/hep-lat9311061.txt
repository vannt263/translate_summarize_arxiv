    "it is important to understand the mechanism of quark confinement in qcd .",
    "we expect that color electric flux is squeezed by the dual meissner effect due to color magnetic monopole condensation@xcite .",
    "it is well known that such a situation occurs in compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory(lgt)@xcite . in qcd",
    ", thooft conjectured that the role is played by the monopoles in abelian projected qcd which can be regarded as an abelian theory with abelian charges and magnetic monopoles@xcite .",
    "we choose the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite in which diagonal components of all link variables are maximized as much as possible by the gauge transformation .",
    "gauge - fixed link variables are decomposed into a product of two matrices @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are a gauge - fixing matrix , an off - diagonal and a diagonal matrix , respectively .",
    "monte carlo simulations in this gauge have shown interesting results , i.e. , abelian dominance @xcite and interesting monopole behaviors @xcite .",
    "these results show that the monopoles play an important role in qcd confinement , but evidence of the monopole condensation in the confinement phase is not yet obtained .    in this report",
    ", we show the ( dual ) meissner effect occurs in the presence of external charges also in qcd@xcite . in the continuum , the assumptions of the abelian dominance and the monopole condensation lead us to a dual form of the abelian ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) theory@xcite .",
    "so we study the g - l type equations between the abelian electric field and the magnetic monopole currents in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair in su(2 ) and su(3 ) , following the method developed by singh et al.@xcite .",
    "our purpose is to apply the method to su(3 ) lgt as well as su(2 ) and to investigate scaling behaviors of the penetration length @xmath6 and the coherence length @xmath7 .",
    "we used the wilson action and simulations are performed on @xmath8 lattice in su(2 ) ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and on @xmath11 lattice in su(3 ) ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "measurements are done every 30 sweeps and we adopted totally 400 configurations in su(2 ) and 500 configurations in su(3 ) . for thermalization , we discarded inital 1500 sweeps .",
    "abelian link variables @xmath5 are extracted after the gauge - fixing is done in the ma gauge .",
    "the average of an observable @xmath14 is computed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an abelian wilson loop .",
    "we used @xmath17 and @xmath18 in su(2 ) and @xmath17 in su(3 ) .",
    "the electric field operator is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an abelian plaquette operator .",
    "monopole currents are defined following degrand - toussaint@xcite .",
    "we investigate the dual g - l equations@xcite : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 the order parameter @xmath24 is given by the following approximate solution of the g - l equation @xmath25 where we adopted @xmath26 .",
    "then we get the following extended london equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an integer and @xmath29 is the quantized electric flux at the origin @xmath30 .",
    "to reproduce the @xmath31data , we choose the following function for the azimuthal component of the monopole current : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are parameters .",
    "the form ensures that @xmath35 vanishes linearly at @xmath30 and exponentialy as @xmath36 .",
    "then , substituting the current into eq.[er ] , we examine the electric field data except the @xmath30 point and determine both the penetration and the coherence lengths .",
    "the typical data of the curl of the monopole currents and the electric field are plotted in fig.1 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if the extreme type-2 dual superconductor is the case , @xmath37 . then , the data with @xmath38 and @xmath39 can not satisfy eq.[er ] .",
    "hence , there must be a region where @xmath40 , i.e. , we need both @xmath6 and @xmath7 also in the su(3 ) case .",
    "the values of the both lengths obtained are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the fluxoid @xmath29 evaluated from the fluxoid relation is consistent with the net flux through the entire lattice in su(2 ) and su(3 ) .",
    "the g - l parameter @xmath41 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the values are close to the borderline of the type-1 and type-2 dual superconductor .",
    "it seems that the data of the large wilson loop show the scaling behaviors .",
    "epsf    = 0.5    = 0.5    [ fig : curl3 ]    = 0.5    = 0.5    = 0.5    [ fig : scale1 ]    = 0.5    = 0.5    [ fig : scale3 ]",
    "we have a direct evidence of the dual meissner effect in @xmath0 and @xmath1 qcd .    1 .   the color electric field and the magnetic monopole current satisfy the extended dual london equation in @xmath0 @xmath42 and @xmath1 @xmath43 lattice",
    "qcd . the monopole current plays the role of the dual `` diamagnetic current '' squeezing the electric flux .",
    "all @xmath6 and @xmath7 data show that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vacua are both close to the borderline of the type-1 and type-2 dual superconductor .",
    "so , it is expected that the vortex - vortex interactions are small .",
    "it seems that the g - l parameter scales near the borderline in the case of the large wilson loop .",
    "therefore , scalar and axial - vector glueball masses are nearly degenerate : @xmath44 4 .",
    "it is interesting to extend this analysis to the study of the extended monopoles@xcite of the type-2 , since large monopole loops are seen to be important @xcite .",
