    "attempts to study the internal gas properties of gps / css sources have been made in several different wavebands .",
    "for instance , optical studies show strong highly excited line emission with large equivalent widths ( gelderman & whittle 1994 ) , consistent with interactions between the radio source and the interstellar medium .",
    "the majority of the small gps sources are weakly polarised ( stanghellini et al.1998 ) , suggesting strong depolarisation consistent with a very large central density .",
    "other evidence for a dense environment comes from free - free absorption observations of for instance oq208 ( kameno et al .",
    "2000 ) and ngc1052 ( e.g. kellermann et al .  1999",
    "; vermeulen et al .  2002a , 2002b ) .",
    "another example is marr et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who found evidence for free - free absorption in the gps 0108 + 388 , consistent with a 100  pc radius disk with an electron density of 500  . also in 1946",
    "+ 708 multi - frequency continuum studies show indications of free - free absorption concentrated toward the core and inner parts of the counter - jet , again suggesting a disk or torus origin ( peck et al.1999 ) .",
    "disk - like kpc - scale distributions of gas have also been found in the optical , and the best example so far is the hst dust disk observed in the gps 4c31.04 ( perlman et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "another way to study the gas content in these sources is by spectral absorption experiments , which are advantageous mainly because the sensitivity is independent of the source redshift . with this method",
    "small masses of gas may be probed , although high column densities are required . using the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen in absorption it is possible to study the atomic hydrogen ( ) content of gps / css sources .",
    "the  is likely only a fraction of the total gas present , therefore the observations provide lower limits to the total gas mass and density .",
    "the strength of gps / css sources at cm wavelengths makes them good targets for such experiments , in addition their small sizes indicate that lines of sight to csss will sample the dense gas confined within the centre of the host galaxy",
    ". similarly the line of sight to a gps source will trace gas within the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "in order to increase the statistics of high redshift sources with associated  absorption , a survey to detect redshifted  in northern sky sources has been performed using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "the wsrt is equipped with wide bandwidth uhf receivers ( 700 - 1200 mhz ) , which enables studies of the redshifted @xmath7  21 cm line of neutral hydrogen for 0.19  @xmath8  1.0 . around 60 gps / css sources",
    "have been searched at the wsrt so far , as parts of several different projects with slightly varying goals ( vermeulen et al .",
    "2002 , in prep . ) . from those sources we select objects which have projected linear sizes @xmath9 kpc , and in addition to our own observations we have included lower redshift gps / csss from the literature which had available hi absorption data ( see pihlstrm 2001 )",
    "including all targets , our preliminary results show a general absorption detection rate of 48% .",
    "however , if we make the gps / css division at 1  kpc , we find that the gps sources have a detection rate of 53% as compared to the css detection rate of 36% .",
    "this could reflect the fact that the more compact sources have a larger part of their continuum emission covered by nuclear gas .",
    "this effect has already been suspected due to the high detection rate of absorption in nearby gps / css objects ( conway 1996 ) .",
    "the probable youth of gps / csss implies the possibility of studying the birth of radio sources , and little is known of the mechanisms triggering the radio activity .",
    "it has been suggested that mergers could provide a way to transport gas to the centre of the host galaxies and thus be involved in the onset of the nuclear engine .",
    "indeed , optical observations have shown that many of the gps / css sources are in disturbed or interacting systems ( de vries et al .",
    "2000 ; odea et al .",
    "if the gps / css sources are young sources resulting from mergers , we expect a gas rich galactic nucleus .",
    "the amount of gas needed to fuel the agn is probably much smaller than the total gas mass available , thus we do not expect the total gas mass to be systematically different between sources which are all younger than a million years",
    ". however , a radial density profile may be reasonable to assume , and then absorption experiments would probe different column densities of gas as the source grows in size ( since most of those objects are lobe - dominated ) . using results from our absorption studies together with results compiled from the literature ,",
    "we here investigate if the amount of neutral atomic gas shows any systematic variation with source size .    despite that a few numbers are still tentative ( data reduction is still in progress for a number of objects )",
    ", there appears to be an anti - correlation between the source linear size and the  column density ( fig .",
    "[ nhi_size ] ) .",
    "a visual inspection suggests that the column densities for sources @xmath0  1 kpc are larger than for those @xmath1  1kpc .",
    "the data set contains upper limits both in  column density , as well as a few points which have upper limits on their size .",
    "we therefore investigated the possible slope in fig .",
    "[ nhi_size ] using the survival analysis package asurv , taking into account also the upper limits ( lavalley et al .",
    "a kendall s tau test show that there exists a correlation between the column density and the linear size with a probability @xmath1  99% , while a spearman s rho test shows a correlation with a probability @xmath1  95% .",
    "linear regression applied with asurv finds the relationship @xmath11@xmath12 ; where @xmath13 is the linear size in kpc .",
    "this linear fit is plotted with a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ nhi_size ] .",
    "an interesting question is whether the population of small sources have larger column densities because the fwhm of the absorption line is wider , or because the line is deeper .",
    "spearman rank tests show no significant correlation between the observed column densities and line widths , while the peak optical depths and linear sizes are correlated with probability @xmath195% .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 , where the solid line represents a least square linear fit to the data points .",
    "the slope is @xmath140.32 , which implies that the slope in fig .",
    "[ nhi_size ] mainly depends on a difference in the observed opacity and is not due to differences in the line width .",
    "our first results show that the column density decreases when the linear size increases , implying a gas density which decreases with radius . such a density distribution could be either spherical or disk like . by integrating the column density along the line - of - sight toward the two lobes , we have investigated some functional forms for the density distribution which may reproduce the observed correlation between linear size and optical depth .",
    "we have assumed a representative viewing angle of 45deg .",
    "figure 3 shows a spherical and an axi - symmetric ( disk - like ) distribution , both with a simple power law radial fall - off in density , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 kpc ) and also a king density profile with a cutoff outside 50 kpc @xmath17 ( 1+@xmath18 ) ( @xmath19 kpc ) . while king profiles can not provide a good fit , in contrast the power law models can fit the data adequately both for spherical and disk - like geometries . for more details , see pihlstrm et al ( 2002 , in prep . ) .    in most cases",
    "the spatial resolution of present  data is not enough to determine whether the absorption covers both lobes ( consistent with ism gas ) or only one lobe ( indicating a disk distribution ) . to date",
    "high resolution  data exist for a limited number of sources that in all cases indicate  disks ( conway 1996 ; peck et al .  1999 ; peck & taylor 1998 ) , which argues for a disk model .",
    "one possibility to distinguish between a disk or a sphere is to look at any possible orientation effects ; in general quasars are supposed to be seen at a smaller viewing angle than the radio galaxies .",
    "because of relativistic boosting the core strength is considered to be a good indicator of orientation ; saikia et al.(1995 ) studied a sample of css sources with detected radio cores and found that the degree of core prominence were consistent with those for larger radio sources and also consistent with the unified scheme . assuming the unified scheme holds for gps / csss , a spherically symmetric distribution could thus be considered less likely , since we in fact have found that there appears to be a larger detection rate in galaxies ( @xmath20 ) than in quasars ( @xmath21 ; pihlstrm 2001 ) .",
    "we note however that there are indications that the gps quasars may not be the same type of objects as the gps galaxies , in which case we can not use the argument of core prominence to distinguish between a disk or a spherical origin of the gas . instead ,",
    "future higher resolution vlbi observations ( using the evn uhf system ) will be needed to determine whether disks are the most common cause of the  absorption also in the higher redshift objects .",
