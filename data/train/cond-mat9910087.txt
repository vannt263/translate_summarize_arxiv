    "the rare - earth borocarbides are believed to be conventional bcs - type superconductors@xcite with a number of interesting properties that are not fully understood .",
    "borocarbides are similar to intermetallic superconductors such as v@xmath6si and nb@xmath6sn in that they have a relatively strong electron - phonon coupling constant and a moderately large density of states at the fermi level.@xcite while it is generally agreed that the electron - phonon interaction is the underlying mechanism for superconductivity in these systems , the responsible phonons are claimed to be either a high - energy phonon ( boron a@xmath3 near 850 @xmath7 ) @xcite or a low - energy soft - mode phonon.@xcite additionally , the borocarbides have relatively simple tetragonal crystal structure , yet they show a variety of physical properties that have been active research topics over the past years . for example ,",
    "some of the borocarbides exhibit magnetic ordering and superconductivity at around the same temperature , offering the possibility of studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.@xcite    even the non - magnetic rare - earth borocarbides @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath0 = y , lu ) show rich superconducting phenomena , such as anisotropic upper critical fields and angular dependence of in - plane magnetization,@xcite a hexagonal - to - square vortex lattice transition,@xcite and phonon - softening at a finite wave vector where strong fermi - surface nesting is suggested.@xcite the results of inelastic neutron scattering measurements@xcite are on soft @xmath8 phonons , which would not be detected using raman spectroscopy .",
    "a study of the low - energy excitation spectra would clearly lead to a more complete understanding of the electronic interaction in these systems .",
    "the superconducting gap has been a major subject of research in superconductivity . up to now",
    ", the gap in borocarbides has been studied by tunneling spectroscopy@xcite and infra - red ( ir ) reflectivity@xcite which are insensitive to the wave vector - space dependence of the gap .",
    "electronic raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the wave vector dependence of the gap .",
    "when the optical penetration depth exceeds the superconducting coherence length , it yields a susceptibility for two quasi - particles of essentially zero total wave vector .",
    "the quasi - particles that contribute to the response are those with wave vectors close to the fermi surface for which the raman vertex has a large modulus squared .",
    "this vertex equals the projection onto the polarization vectors of the incident and scattered photons of a tensor closely related to the inverse effective mass tensor .",
    "manipulation of the polarization vectors changes the raman symmetry and selectively probes the gap near certain regions of the fermi surface.@xcite raman spectroscopy studies have played an important role in understanding superconductivity of conventional@xcite and exotic superconductors.@xcite for example , superconductivity - induced redistribution of the electronic continua of the high - t@xmath9 superconductors led to important clues as to the d - wave nature of the order parameter .",
    "however , there remain unsolved puzzles regarding different values of the 2@xmath2 peak positions in different scattering geometries , the power - law behavior of the scattering response below 2@xmath2 and its relation to the d - wave nature of the order parameter , and to the role of impurities .",
    "until now there has been only one kind of `` conventional '' superconductors ( @xmath10 ) whose gap was measured by electronic raman , while there are numerous oxide superconductors measured by the same technique .",
    "in other words , we do not really know how the conventional superconductors behave in the electronic raman studies . without a sound background for comparison",
    ", many of the studies of `` unconventional '' behavior of the exotic superconductors would be meaningless . from number of aspects ( including our own measurements ) , borocarbides seem to behave conventionally . thus borocarbides would be suitable choice of superconductor for investigation usingelectronic raman spectroscopy .    in this paper , we report an observation of clear redistribution of the electronic continua in different scattering geometries in the @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath0 = y , lu ) borocarbides in the superconducting state .",
    "2@xmath2-like peaks were observed in the superconducting state in a@xmath3 , b@xmath3 , and b@xmath4 raman symmetry from single crystals .",
    "the peaks in a@xmath3 and b@xmath4 symmetries are significantly sharper and stronger than the peak in b@xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the temperature dependence of the frequencies of the peaks shows typical bcs - type behavior of the superconducting gap , but the apparent values of the @xmath5 gap are strongly anisotropic for both systems .",
    "in contrast to what we normally expect from conventional superconductors , we find reproducible scattering strength below the 2@xmath2-like peak in all the scattering geometries .",
    "this is the first raman measurement that shows finite scattering below the gap - like peaks of the `` conventional '' superconductors .",
    "previous measurements on @xmath11 were too noisy to detect any finite scattering below the gap.@xcite",
    "all the samples measured in this work were single crystals grown by the flux- growth method.@xcite samples were characterized by various measurements , including resistivity versus temperature , magnetization versus temperature , and neutron scattering.@xcite the crystal structure of @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c is tetragonal body - centered space group @xmath12 , and phononic raman analyses have been made earlier.@xcite raman spectra were obtained in a pseudo - backscattering geometry using a custom - made subtractive triple - grating spectrometer designed for very small raman shifts and ultra low intensities.@xcite 3 mw of 6471  kr - ion laser light was focused onto a spot of @xmath13 @xmath14m@xmath15 , which results in heating of the spot above the temperature of the sample environment .",
    "the temperature of the spot on the sample surface was estimated by solving the heat - diffusion equation .",
    "@xmath2 t , the rise in temperature is proportional to the inverse of the thermal conductivity of the sample .",
    "@xmath2 t is largest at lowest temperature because the thermal conductivity is smaller at lower temperatures.@xcite the estimated @xmath2 t is 2.7k at 4k and 0.9k at 14k for the case of yni@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystal . the ambient temperature at which the raman continua begin to show the redistribution was determined to be 14k , which is in agreement with this estimation .",
    "all the spectra have been corrected for the bose factor .",
    "they therefore are proportional to the imaginary part of the raman susceptibility .",
    "superconductivity - induced changes in the b@xmath4 and b@xmath3 spectra of yni@xmath1b@xmath1c taken at different temperatures are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the quality of the sample surfaces was good enough that raman spectra could be taken down to @xmath1610 @xmath7 .",
    "sharp drops of the spectra below 10 @xmath7 ( for b@xmath4 and b@xmath3 ) or 20 @xmath7 ( for a@xmath3 ) are due to cutoff of the filtering stage , and the sharp rises near zero frequency are due to the laser line ( 6471  ) .",
    "the relative strengths of the spectra in different scattering geometries are meaningful although the absolute values of the scattering strength are in arbitrary units in all the figures . in the superconducting state",
    "( t @xmath17 7 k ) , the spectra show a clear redistribution of the scattering weight : depletion of the weight at low frequencies ( @xmath18 40 @xmath7 ) and the accumulation of the weight above @xmath16 40 @xmath7 , resulting in sharp gap - like peaks in both b@xmath4 and b@xmath3 symmetries . the gap - like feature is more prominent and sharper in b@xmath4 symmetry than in b@xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the sharpness of the b@xmath4 peak suggests that its origin may be different from that of b@xmath3 .",
    "the peak at 200 @xmath7 is the ni b@xmath3 phonon mode , the height of which ( 1250 on the same scale ) is much stronger than the b@xmath3 electronic raman peaks .",
    "previous raman measurements on borocarbides concentrated mainly on phononic peaks,@xcite and the gap features were not observed in earlier electronic raman measurements.@xcite electronic raman spectra from borocarbides are so weak that a sensitive spectrometer with good stray - light rejection is required .    the peak frequency @xmath19 , read from graphs , of the peak feature taken at 7 k is normalized in such a way that its normalized value is the same as the value of the reduced superconducting gap @xmath2(t=7k)/@xmath20 (= 0.95 ) in the bcs theory , where @xmath20 = @xmath2(t = 0 ) , at the reduced temperature of 0.45 (= 7/15.5 ) .",
    "@xmath19(0 ) , the values of the peak frequency in the limit of 0 k thus obtained are 40.1 @xmath7 for b@xmath4 and 48.9 @xmath7 for b@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath19/@xmath19(0 ) , the normalized frequencies of the peaks of the peak features as functions of the reduced temperatures follow the curve for @xmath2(t)/@xmath20 predicted by the bcs theory as shown in the insets of the figure .",
    "this suggests that the peak features arise due to opening of the superconducting gap and provides some evidence that borocarbides are conventional bcs - type superconductors .",
    "one of the advantages of the borocarbide superconductors is that their upper critical fields ( @xmath21 at 6 k ) can be easily reached by using commercial superconducting magnets .",
    "we applied strong magnetic fields ( up to 7 t ) parallel to c - axis and investigated the effects on these gap - like features of both yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and luni@xmath1b@xmath1c crystals at low temperatures .",
    "the gap - like features were completely suppressed by the strong magnetic fields , confirming that these features are indeed induced by superconductivity .",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 a. ) full analysis of the dependence on magnetic fields of the peak frequencies and the features below the gap will be presented in an additional manuscript .    unlike other gap - probing measurements such as tunneling experiments and x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) , raman spectroscopy is able to measure the anisotropy of the gap at a high resolution of a few @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , electronic raman spectroscopy has an advantage over infra - red spectroscopy@xcite in studying the gap of superconductors in their clean limit .",
    "figure  2 shows raman spectra in a@xmath3 , b@xmath3 , and b@xmath4 geometries of yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and luni@xmath1b@xmath1c in superconducting states and in normal states .",
    "spectra in e@xmath23 geometry were difficult to acquire from either fractured or polish - then - etched ac surfaces , even if those surfaces were optically flat .",
    "the a@xmath3 spectra reflect weighted average of the fermi surface with a weighting function of @xmath24 symmetry ; the b@xmath3 spectra , @xmath25 symmetry ; and the b@xmath4 spectra , @xmath26 symmetry .",
    "the polarizations used were such that a contribution of a@xmath4 symmetry is possible in all three cases ; however , the a@xmath4 spectrum is expected to be negligible .",
    "the most apparent phenomenon is the anisotropy in the intensity and sharpness of the gap - like features .",
    "the a@xmath3 and b@xmath4 peaks are significantly stronger and sharper than the b@xmath3 peak . together with the smaller values of the positions of the a@xmath3 and b@xmath4 peaks than that of b@xmath3 peak",
    "as detailed below , this suggests that the sharp a@xmath3 and b@xmath4 peaks might be a reflection of collective modes .",
    "further investigation is necessary to clarify the origin of the peaks .",
    "the b@xmath3 gap energy is considerably larger than the b@xmath4 gap energy signifying perhaps that the gap parameters are anisotropic for both yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and luni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "the apparent gap anisotropy is more pronounced in yni@xmath1b@xmath1c than in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "the values extrapolated at t = 0 are @xmath20 ( a@xmath3 ) = 2.5 mev ( 2@xmath20/kt@xmath9 = 3.7 ) , @xmath20 ( b@xmath3 ) = 3.0 mev ( 2@xmath20/kt@xmath9 = 4.5 ) , and @xmath20 ( b@xmath4 ) = 2.5 mev ( 2@xmath20/kt@xmath9 = 3.7 ) for yni@xmath1b@xmath1c , while @xmath20 ( a@xmath3 ) = 3.0 mev ( 2@xmath20/kt@xmath9 = 4.4 ) , @xmath20 ( b@xmath3 ) = 3.3 mev ( 2@xmath20/kt@xmath9 = 4.8 ) , and @xmath20 ( b@xmath4 ) = 3.1 mev ( 2@xmath20/kt@xmath9 = 4.5 ) for luni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "these values are different from the values from other measurements.@xcite for instance , an ir reflectivity measurement reports @xmath20 = 3.46 mev for polycrystalline yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and @xmath20 = 2.68 mev for single crystal luni@xmath1b@xmath1c.@xcite    there is reproducible spectral weight below the @xmath5 peak in both symmetries for both yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and luni@xmath1b@xmath1c systems .",
    "special care was taken in studying the features below the gap : samples with high - quality surfaces were selected ; higher resolution and longer exposure times were employed figure  3 shows raman spectra of yni@xmath1b@xmath1c(b@xmath27 isotope ) in b@xmath4 and b@xmath3 symmetries . in this particular case ,",
    "the cutoff of the filter state in the spectrometer was 6 @xmath7 .",
    "as far as the spectral weight below the @xmath5 peak is concerned , samples with different boron isotopes give the same results . both b@xmath4 and b@xmath3 spectra",
    "show finite raman scattering below the gap and it appears to be roughly linear to the raman frequency below 30 @xmath7 . for the b@xmath4 spectrum",
    ", there is an abrupt slope change at about 30 @xmath28 .",
    "similar linear - in - frequency behavior was observed in the spectra of luni@xmath1b@xmath1c below 35 @xmath7 .",
    "the possibility of instrumental broadening is ruled out by measuring the spectral widths of kr - ion plasma lines , which are about 2.5 @xmath7 in the spectral range of these measurements .",
    "such a feature below the gap could rise from different causes .",
    "we eliminate the possibilities of a ) an extrinsic phase on the sample surfaces and b ) inhomogeneity of the probing laser beam , and argue that this sub - gap feature is intrinsic to the borocarbide superconductors .",
    "this would constitute the first , definitive experimental observation of finite raman scattering below the gap feature for the `` conventional '' superconductors .",
    "previous measurements on @xmath10 compounds were simply too noisy to detect any finite scattering below the gap .",
    "@xcite    \\a ) the borocarbide single crystals do have extrinsic phases , mostly from the flux . in our measurements",
    ", we were able to avoid such flux phases .",
    "if the sub - gap feature were due to an extrinsic phase , the intensity of the sub - gap feature would be dependent on the measurement conditions , e.g. , dependent on the fraction of flux under the exciting focussed laser spot.all the spectra showed the same intensity , independent of where the spot was located .",
    "x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) analyses show that the flux phase on the surface of the single crystals is ni@xmath6b or ni@xmath6bc . scanning electron microscopy ( sem )",
    "did not reveal any small - grained structures on the surface or edges of the single crystals .",
    "auger analyses did not show any fine structures either .",
    "furthermore , they showed that chemical compositions did not vary significantly from point to point on the surface .",
    "all these analyses suggest that there is no fine - grained extrinsic phase contributing to the raman spectra .",
    "in addition , we actually measured the raman spectra of the flux phase itself ( fig .  3 a ) .",
    "even if _ all _ the raman intensity above the gap feature is assumed to be due to the flux ( over - estimation of the flux contribution ) , a finite raman intensity below the peak feature is always obtained ( under - estimation of the intrinsic contribution ) , as shown in fig .",
    "3 b.    \\b ) an experimental situation where part of the measured spot is normal ( or close to the normal state ) and another part is deep in the superconducting state due to inhomogeneity of the laser spot could lead to finite scattering intensity below the gap .",
    "this senario is excluded as follows :",
    "1 . in the measurements ,",
    "spatial filtering the excitation laser source was used to make the incident beam as homogeneous as possible .",
    "we used several different laser intensities and confirmed the same feature below the gap . the overall intensity scaled with the incident power as long as the heating effect was small , so that the temperature of the measured spot remained well below t@xmath9 .",
    "the sharpness of the b@xmath4 peak itself indicates that the actual temperature of the measured spot is quite uniform and well below t@xmath9 .",
    "otherwise , we should not be able to see such a steep slope below the b@xmath4 peak .",
    "therefore , we believe that the finite raman intensity below the peak feature is intrinsic .",
    "cuprate superconductors show finite raman response below the 2@xmath2-like peak even in the superconducting state.@xcite the lack of the complete suppression of the raman response below the 2@xmath2 peak has been regarded as evidence that the superconducting gap function of cuprates has nodes where the gap vanishes.@xcite in simple bcs picture no density of states is allowed below the superconducting gap ; thus , no raman scattering beyond small smearing effects is expected below the gap in bcs - type superconductors .",
    "however , in this work , finite raman scattering is observed below the gap of borocarbides .",
    "it is interesting to note that kim@xcite finds finite low - energy states below the gap in s - wave superconductors by considering a finite - ranged pairing interaction energy .",
    "the quasiparticle density of states calculated numerically resembles the b@xmath4 raman spectra shown in fig .",
    "the underlying mechanism that gives rise to the linear - in - frequency behavior below the 2@xmath2 gap for the borocarbides , which are believed to be conventional bcs - type superconductors , needs to be clarified further .",
    "in conclusion , sharp redistributions of the continuum of raman spectra were observed in different geometries for the @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath0 = y , lu ) systems upon going into the superconducting states .",
    "2@xmath2-like features were observed in the a@xmath3 , b@xmath3 , and b@xmath4 spectra of the @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath0= y , lu ) single crystals in the superconducting states .",
    "the peak features in a@xmath3 and b@xmath4 geometry are sharper and stronger than those in b@xmath3 geometry .",
    "the features are suppressed by applied magnetic fields , suggesting that they are indeed closely related to the gap parameter 2@xmath2 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the peaks of the 2@xmath2-like features shows typical bcs - type behavior of the gap values as a function of temperature .",
    "however , the apparent values of the gap are anisotropic , and the anisotropy is more pronounced in yni@xmath1b@xmath1c than in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "finite raman scattering below the gap was experimentally observed in these `` conventional '' superconductors .",
    "the finite scattering is intrinsic and it appears to be linear in the raman frequency .",
    "the lack of complete suppression of the raman response below the 2@xmath2 peak of apparent bcs - type superconductors needs to be further addressed .",
