    "currently there is mounting cosmological evidence for an effective number of neutrino species slightly larger than three @xcite .",
    "this result will be tested in detail by the planck mission , and if confirmed will provide solid evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "additional sterile neutrino states which are partially or fully thermalised via their mixing with the active species is perhaps the most likely candidate for extra relativistic degrees of freedom because thermalisation must occur well below the qcd phase transition temperature .",
    "if not , the density of this extra radiation is heavily diluted by the entropy release at the phase transition .    intriguingly , also in oscillation experiments there is some evidence pointing to the possible existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the simplest explanation of the lsnd experiment studying @xmath1 flavor conversion @xcite requires low mass sterile states @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more complete list of references ) .",
    "very recently , the miniboone experiment has released data from a study of the same channel which seems to confirm the lsnd result .",
    "however , no compatible excess was found in the @xmath2 channel by miniboone .",
    "if both results are correct it would require some source of @xmath3 -violation .",
    "recent publications suggest two viable options ; either there are at least two sterile states @xcite , or one sterile state plus non - standard charged current -like neutrino interactions ( nsi ) .",
    "these interactions enables a produced ( or detected ) neutrino to be a linear combination of flavour eigenstates @xcite .    in their paper akhmedov and schwetz , @xcite ,",
    "find that the 3 + 1 ( active + sterile neutrinos ) nsi model gives a somewhat nicer fit than the 3 + 2 scenario mentioned above .",
    "this is especially true when considering global data - which includes the findings of disappearance experiments for @xmath4 or @xmath5 in addition to the data of the already mentioned appearance experiments with @xmath1 & @xmath2 .",
    "however in the context of beta - decay experiments such as katrin @xcite ( which will be the topic of this paper ) one measures the number of electrons emitted as a function of their energies .",
    "so even though the electron neutrino might become a combination of flavour eigenstates the electron still has a well - defined energy .",
    "thus , as a consequence of simple energy conservation , the electron spectrum is only sensitive to the neutrino mass states and a beta - decay experiment would not be sensitive to the nsi .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the presence of nsi the effective mixing angle appearing in the beta spectrum is not the simply @xmath6 , but rather the contribution of the fourth mass state to the electron neutrino state , as defined in eq .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    considering on the other hand the 3 + 2 model ,",
    "the two additional low mass sterile states might at first seem incompatible with cosmological neutrino mass constraints . but",
    "as it turns out the mass bound is actually significantly relaxed by the presence of extra energy density , and it is possible to have sterile states with masses close to 1 ev , compatible with the miniboone result @xcite .    very interestingly in both models",
    "the sterile neutrinos would have large mixing with @xmath0 such that in nuclear beta decay it might be possible to see direct evidence for the existence of sterile states .",
    "additionally one would not have to worry about @xmath3-phases causing cancellations - as would be the case in neutrinoless double beta decay - because the kinematic neutrino mass is an incoherent sum of the mass states .    in this paper",
    "we perform a forecast for katrin - like experiments in terms of the prospects for observing such sterile states .",
    "even though an active neutrino mass of 1 ev is still allowed by beta decay experiments it is disfavoured by cosmological data ( and would require neutrinos to be dirac particles in order not to have produced observable neutrinoless double beta decays ) and we therefore consider a hierarchy in which all three active species are very light , with masses too small to be seen in experiments like katrin , while the sterile state(s ) have masses in a range accessible by katrin ( see also e.g.  @xcite for earlier discussions of this possibility ) .",
    "we then investigate how well such an experiment will be able to detect ev mass sterile states , depending on their mixing with @xmath7 .",
    "we wish first and foremost to get an overview of the experimental detection probabilities .",
    "therefore we use a rather large sterile parameter space in combination with simulations that take all the experimental settings of a katrin - like experiment into account .",
    "the next section contains a description of the analysis framework used , section 3 is a presentation of our main results - for both a 3 + 1 and a 3 + 2 scenario - and finally in section 4 we make some concluding remarks .",
    "as mentioned we use a realistic simulation of the katrin experiment - commissioned to begin data - taking in 2012 - to investigate if a similar experiment will be able to see direct evidence for sterile neutrino states .",
    "+ the main ingredient in the analysis is a toy model monte carlo and analysis programme for katrin - like experiments written by c.  weinheimer .",
    "the programme contains all the major experimental settings and has previously been used to forecast the experimental sensitivity to the neutrino mass .",
    "a much more thourogh simulation procedure is currently being built for the katrin collaboration .",
    "this will take into account the finer details of the windowless gaseous tritium source , the differential pumping and cryogenic trapping sections in the transportation of the electrons from the source to the spectrometer , and of course the entire final electrodynamic properties of the spectrometer .",
    "currently however neither the spectrometer or the source have been completed and an ultra - realistic simulation might therefore be subject to final changes anyway .",
    "so for the purpose of current forecasts of the detection abilities of a katrin - like experiment this is the most realistic simulation tool one can get . for a thorough description of the workings and parameters of this code see @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the @xmath8-routine of the programme in a modified version of cosmomc @xcite with cosmology turned off and flat priors on all input parameters .    in doing",
    "so we have performed a bayesian analysis on the theoretical beta spectra while keeping the error bars of the original monte carlo driver @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the mixing angles were held fixed in this analysis .",
    "while this is of course a perfectly valid way to perform the analysis one may argue that the mixing angles should be free parameters as well as the masses .",
    "however the mixing angles - or more precisely their corresponding entry in the leptonic mixing matrix - determine the amplitude of the electron spectra for each separate neutrino mass state .",
    "when looking at the sum of the mass states , that is the total beta - decay spectrum , it is a lot easier to extract knowledge of the neutrino masses ( position of the kinks in the spectrum ) than the mixing angles ( relative height of the kinks ) . so in order to get well - constrained results we have kept the mixing angles fixed and one can of course perform such an analysis for as fine a grid of mixing angles as desired .",
    "finally , oscillation experiments are much better suited for precise measurements of mixing angles than beta - decay experiments . in a realistic",
    "setting a measurement by katrin will be combined with short baseline oscillation data to obtain good constraints on both mass and mixing angle .    to the theoretical description of the single neutrino beta spectrum",
    "we then add massive sterile neutrinos connected to the active neutrino by mixing angles .",
    "we note that katrin can in fact not resolve the mass squared differences between the known active states ( of @xmath9 ev@xmath10 and @xmath11 ev@xmath10 ) so in the following we can safely keep treating the active sector as one neutrino .    in complete analogy with eqs .",
    "16 and 21 of @xcite the total spectrum is a weighted sum of the spectra for the individual mass states .",
    "each mass state is weighted by the relevant mixing angles as explained above .",
    "that is the appropriate element of the corresponding leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath12 . in the case of the 3 + 2 scenario the full 5-neutrino description",
    "@xmath12 would look like this @xmath13 and a @xmath14 analogy would play the same role in any 3 + 1 model . for the remainder of this paper",
    "the weighting factor is written @xmath15 ( e representing the electron neutrino and i representing the contribution of mass state i ) .",
    "we begin by considering only one sterile neutrino . under the assumption",
    "that the three active neutrinos can be treated as one we investigate firstly @xmath16 mixing schemes where one active and one sterile species are considered as two separate blocks connected via a single mixing angle @xmath17 . in order to satisfy current mass bounds on the active neutrinos we shall assume the active neutrino to be massless and the sterile neutrino to have a given mass and mixing angle . we do not investigate the reverse mass ordering and we keep the assumption of active massless and sterile massive neutrinos for the investigation of the 3 + 2 scenario as well . in our @xmath16 mixing matrix we must now have @xmath18 , in order to conserve probability .",
    "we investigate the response of a katrin - like experiment to the presence of sterile neutrinos for a grid of @xmath19 combinations of sterile neutrino masses and mixing weights . as a starting point for our choice of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath6",
    "we look at the analysis of 3 + 2 scenarios in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they give the following best fit area for 2 additional sterile neutrinos : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here",
    "we want to investigate the sensitivity of a katrin like experiment to a relatively wide range of mass of mixing parameters , including the values above .",
    "we take the sterile mass to be larger than the projected katrin sensitivity of 0.2 ev , and to be conservative we investigate masses up to 6.4 ev .",
    "we note that such large masses are strongly disfavoured by cosmology if the sterile neutrinos are equilibrated in the early universe .",
    "however , even for large mixing angles , equilibration can be blocked by the presence of a e.g.  a small but non - zero lepton asymmetry and therefore the cosmological mass bound does not necessarily constrain the upper mass range . meanwhile @xmath6 is varied from @xmath25 up to 0.18 , i.e.  a very wide range of mixing angles .",
    "large values of @xmath6 are disfavoured by disappearance data ( the most recent analysis of which can be found in @xcite ) , but are included here for completeness .",
    "the exact values of @xmath20 and @xmath6 in the @xmath26 matrix of parameters studied are listed in table [ tab : allset1 ] .",
    ".sterile neutrino parameters [ tab : allset1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in total we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 so , in conclusion our definition of the amplitude is @xmath29 with the parameter values given in table  [ tab : allset3 ] we get an amplitude of @xmath30"
