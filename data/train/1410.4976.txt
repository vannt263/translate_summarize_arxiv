    "have been answered only recently in @xcite by pants decomposition and gluing methods .",
    "our initial aim , originating the present work , was to use isomonodromy method in order to answer the lam case as a test ; as we shall see , we actually reduce the above question to the existence of poles for painlev vi transcendents , which looks difficult , of a different nature though .",
    "the lam equation may be viewed as a logarithmic @xmath0-connection on the trivial vector bundle @xmath42 over the elliptic curve @xmath43 , having a single pole at @xmath19 : any eigenvector of the residual matrix connection at @xmath19 provides a cyclic vector going back to the scalar elliptic form . on the other hand",

    "consider its isomonodromic deformation @xmath9 when the complex structure of the curve @xmath10 varry ; here , the parameter @xmath7 of the deformation has to be considered in the universal cover @xmath50 , the teichmller space of the once punctured torus .",
    "when the pole of the lam connection is not apparent , this unique deformation is characterized by the fact that its monodromy representation is locally constant .",
    "equivalently , the deformation is induced by the unique logarithmic integrable connection on the universal curve @xmath51 having a single pole along the section @xmath52 whose restriction to the initial fiber @xmath49 coincides with @xmath48 .",
    "our initial question becomes : _ for which connection / representation can we insure that the underlying vector bundle @xmath13 becomes trivial for some convenient parameter @xmath7 along the isomonodromic deformation of a lam connection ? _    in this paper , we will compute the variation of the vector bundle @xmath13 along the isomonodromic deformation of a lam connection and show that it is given by a solution of the painlev vi equation for some convenient parameter ; the bundle @xmath13 becomes then trivial only when the painlev transcendent has a pole ( outside @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "we are finally led to the following question which seems widely open : _ do painlev transcendents have poles ? _",
    "actually , much more interesting is the similar question for regular connections over genus @xmath53 curves .",
    "following @xcite , regular projective structures correspond there to regular connections on the maximally unstable undecomposable @xmath54-bundle ( a @xmath0-oper in the sense of @xcite ,  2.7 ) .",

    "following atiyah @xcite , almost all rank @xmath46 vector bundles on @xmath43 with trivial determinant are decomposable , i.e. of the form @xmath68 to complete the list , one has to add @xmath61 extra bundles @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "the * isomonodromic deformation * of a lam connection is defined as follows .",
    "consider the universal cover @xmath80 , namely the teichmller space of the punctured torus , and the universal legendre curve @xmath51 over this parameter space : the fiber @xmath10 at some point @xmath7 is precisely the curve @xmath81 ( by abuse of notation , we denote by @xmath7 a point of @xmath82 and its projection on @xmath4 ) .",

    "the deformation @xmath85 induced over the family @xmath86 is the isomonodromic deformation of @xmath48 .",
    "when the pole of @xmath87 is not an apparent singular point ( i.e. having local monodromy @xmath88 ) , then @xmath85 is precisely the unique deformation having constant monodromy representation .",
    "the exponent @xmath89 of the lam connection is constant along such a deformation . finally , one can talk about the variation of the underlying vector bundle @xmath13 along the deformation just by considering the moduli map @xmath90 defined above .",
    "our result is    [ t : main ] let @xmath9 be the isomonodromic deformation of an irreducible lam connection .",
    "then , for a zariski open subset of the parameter space @xmath82 , the underlying vector bundle @xmath13 is semistable ( see @xcite ) and its tu invariant @xmath91 defined by ( [ e : modulisemistablebundle ] ) is solution of the painlev vi differential equation @xmath92 with parameter @xmath93 where @xmath89 is the exponent of the lam connection .    by `` zariski open '' ,",
    "we just mean that exceptional values of @xmath7 form a discrete subset of the parameter space @xmath82 .",
    "this actually directly follows from @xcite .",
    "it is already known that isomonodromic deformation of ( generic ) lam connections are parametrized by painlev vi equation with parameters specified above : in @xcite , isomonodromic deformation equations are directly computed on the elliptic curve , and the elliptic form of painlev vi equation ( see @xcite ) is recognized .",
    "our approach of this result is quite different .",
    "we first prove , using the riemann - hilbert correspondence , that any irreducible lam connection can be pushed down , via the @xmath46-fold cover @xmath94 as a logarithmic rank @xmath46 connection over @xmath4 with @xmath61 poles , namely at the ramification values @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we are back to the classical case of fuchs : the isomonodromic deformation is parametrized by a solution , say @xmath11 , of the painlev vi equation with parameter @xmath95 .",
    "this already explains why painlev vi equation arises in the lam case ; so far , no computation is needed .",
    "elementary birational geometry is used to go back to the initial deformation @xmath9 and the moduli @xmath76 of the vector bundle @xmath13 can be computed by means of @xmath11 : we recognize in @xmath96 the image of @xmath11 by the okamoto symetry @xmath97 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this automatically implies that @xmath96 is also solution of the painlev vi equation , but with new parameter @xmath98 .",
    "a similar statement holds for the classical painlev vi setting ( logarithmic @xmath0-connections over @xmath4 with @xmath61 poles ) , when considering the parabolic bundle defined by eigendirections of the residual matrix of the connection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , we can start with the isomonodromic deformation of a rank @xmath46 logarithmic connection with @xmath61 poles over @xmath4 , parametrized by any painlev vi transcendent @xmath11",
    ". then one can lift - up conveniently the deformation over the legendre elliptic curve @xmath10 as a rank @xmath46 logarithmic connection with poles at the ramification points @xmath99 in such a way that the moduli @xmath96 of the vector bundle is the okamoto symetric @xmath97 of @xmath11 ; this provides a new geometric interpretation of this strange symetry .",
    "we thus obtain in a natural way an isomonodromic deformation problem ( a lax pair ) for the general elliptic form of the painlev vi equation , just by considering those rank @xmath46 and trace free logarithmic connection over @xmath10 having poles at the @xmath46-order points @xmath99 that moreover commute with the elliptic involution @xmath100 ; this has been also considered in @xcite .",
    "when we set @xmath32 , all lam connections with vanishing exponent are reducible , but those regular ones can still be pushed down to @xmath4 : our result remains valid in this case and we retrieve the    [ cor : hitchin ] let @xmath101 be the isomonodromic deformation of a regular rank @xmath6 connection on the legendre deformation @xmath10 and let @xmath102-[\\omega_\\infty]\\right)$ ] be the underlying line bundle , @xmath103 . then @xmath104 is solution of painlev vi equation with parameters @xmath105 .",
    "one can explicitely compute , in this case , the variation of the line bundle @xmath106 by means of elliptic functions and retrieve the    [ cor : picard ] the general solution of painlev vi equation with parameters @xmath105 is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the universal cover and @xmath109 , half - periods of @xmath10 .",
    "the painlev transcendents of corollary [ cor : picard ] have poles if , and only if , either @xmath110 or @xmath111 is not real .",

    "let us fix exponents @xmath114 and consider a logarithmic @xmath0-connection @xmath1 over @xmath4 with poles at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and prescribed exponents : eigenvalues of the residual matrix at @xmath115 are @xmath116 , for @xmath70 .",

    "if @xmath45 do have pole at each @xmath99 , the parabolic structure is perfectly well defined by the connection and the choice of exponents @xmath120 ( they are defined up to a sign ) .",
