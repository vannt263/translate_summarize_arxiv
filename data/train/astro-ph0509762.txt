    "the detection of magnetic activity signatures in very late - type dwarfs ( late m@xmath4l ) is puzzling , as the fraction of objects showing h@xmath0 in emission , the traditional activity signature , declines precipitously past type m8 @xcite .",
    "the rotation - activity correlation found in earlier type stars ( f to early m ) appears to break down : most objects m9 and cooler have rapid rotation , but weak or undetectable h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "models suggest @xcite that the highly neutral atmospheres of these ultracool objects should be incapable of sustaining the kinds of magnetic stresses which pervade the atmospheres of solar - like stars ( g , k , early m ) and participating in the non - radiative heating of chromospheric and coronal plasma . and yet , transition region , x - ray , and radio persistent emission is clearly detected in some objects @xcite , along with flare - like variability @xcite .",
    "transition region and x - ray observations detect persistent fluxes at levels compatible with scaling laws ( based on h@xmath0 ) extrapolated from earlier type m dwarfs .",
    "the detection of both persistent and flaring radio emission from a handful of late m and l objects , reported in @xcite and @xcite , suggests that nonthermal radio emission is also present at these late spectral types .",
    "the interpretation of the radio emission , however , is complicated by the fact that many potential mechanisms may be at work . in an effort to better understand the radio emission from late m dwarfs",
    ", we undertook a deep pointing of an object previously detected at a single radio frequency .",
    "tvlm513 - 46546 ( = 2mass j15010818 + 2250020 ) is a young disk m9 dwarf , located at a distance of 10.5 pc .",
    "it was first detected in @xcite .",
    "it has h@xmath0 emission which is variable ( equivalent width measurements of 1.8   and 3.5  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and rapid rotation ( v@xmath560 km s@xmath6 ) corresponding to a minimum rotation period of 2.4 hours ( see  5 ) .",
    "there is no evidence of a physical companion between 0.1  and 5  @xcite .",
    "luminosity and effective temperature estimates from @xcite are @xmath7 - 3.65 and t@xmath82200 k. the lack of lithium in the spectrum constrains it to be more massive than 0.06 m@xmath9 and thus likely a very low mass star rather than a brown dwarf .",
    "tvlm513 - 46546 ( hereafter , tvlm513 ) was detected in the radio at a wavelength of 3.6 cm by @xcite , who gave an average flux density of 308@xmath1016 @xmath11jy , with evidence of variability ( peak flux of 1100 @xmath11jy ) .",
    "observations were made on 2004 january 24 with the nrao very large array ( vla ) when the array was being reconfigured from b to c configuration .",
    "the observations spanned @xmath1211.3 hrs , using receivers at 20 , 6 , and 3.6 cm . the flux density calibrator was 3c286 , with assumed flux densities at 20 , 6 , and 3.6 cm of 14.5 , 7.4 , and 5.2 jy , respectively .",
    "the phase calibrator at all frequencies was 1513 + 236 , with flux densities of 1.7 , 0.8 , and 0.5 jy at 20 , 6 and 3.6 cm , respectively .",
    "data reduction was performed in aips .",
    "the observing strategy involved time sharing between frequency bands , with approximately 10 minutes on source per frequency ; we reduced each frequency separately , first imaging the field of view to determine if the object was detected , then removing all background sources from the visibility dataset and re - imaging the field .",
    "a two - dimensional gaussian was fit to the source , deriving intensity and source location . for frequencies",
    "at which a positive detection was made , the discrete fourier transform of the visibilities was made as a function of time using the aips task dftpl to examine variability .",
    "images in stokes v were also made to search for any evidence of circularly polarized flux .",
    "tvlm513 was strongly detected at 6 and 3.6 cm , with a marginal detection ( 5.6@xmath13 ) at 20 cm .",
    "table  [ tbl : fluxes ] describes the parameters of the radio source at each frequency for the time - integrated data .",
    "the derived spectral index between 6 and 3.6 cm is @xmath2 , and between 20 and 6 cm it is 0.1@xmath100.2 .",
    "the upper limits ( 3@xmath13 ) on the amount of circularly polarized flux at 3.6 and 6 cm lead to constraints on the circular polarization v / i of @xmath14 15% .",
    "the persistent nature of the radio flux as well as the lack of circular polarization signal points to a uniform coverage of the stellar disk with magnetic fields , either large or small - scale .",
    "we computed the distribution of 63.6 cm spectral indices from a small sample of radio observations of dme and dke stars , compiled by @xcite .",
    "although there is a fair amount of scatter ( the slope errors range from 0.050.5 ) , the distribution can be fit well by a gaussian with fwhm=1.5 , centered at @xmath15 , which agrees with the measured value for tvlm513 .",
    "the upper limits on circular polarization are also consistent with the general trends of quiescent radio emission from dme stars @xcite .",
    "estimation of the brightness temperature requires separating the observed source flux density from the source size .",
    "we can place conservative limits by assuming the source extent to be the stellar diameter ; at 10.5 pc , the fluxes listed in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] imply brightness temperatures of a few times 10@xmath16 k. this is consistent with gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "figure  [ fig : vary ] plots the variation of tvlm513 at the two frequencies in which it was strongly detected during the course of the observation . during the observations of tvlm513 reported in @xcite a flare ( factor of 4 increase in flux density ) over",
    "@xmath17 25 minutes was recorded .",
    "that radio flare was accompanied by large values of circular polarization ( reaching @xmath1270% ) .",
    "in contrast , our observations appear to be characterized by quiescent conditions .",
    "a lomb normalized periodogram of the 3.6 cm light curve reveals peaks at frequencies corresponding to periods 2.1 and 2.8 hr , although the false - alarm probability is significant ( 0.22 and 0.54 for 2.1 and 2.8 hr periods , respectively ) .",
    "there are no strong periods in the 6 cm light curve .",
    "we examined the periods in the 3.6 cm light curve by imaging the target in each @xmath17 10 minute scan , and fitting a two - dimensional gaussian to the point source .",
    "the variation of the peak intensity found this way matches those determined from the dftpl program , and the same periodicities are produced from a power spectrum of the light curve .",
    "we would expect a minimum rotation period for tvlm513 of 2.4 hours , given the @xmath18 of 60 km s@xmath6 and a stellar radius of 0.12r@xmath9 ( based on direct mass and radius determination for ogle - tr-122b of m@xmath190.092@xmath100.009 m@xmath9 , r@xmath190.120@xmath20r@xmath9 by radial velocity variations and transit depths , * ? ? ?",
    "we performed @xmath21 tests to determine whether the data were consistent with no variability , by comparing the fluxes with the average flux density from the observation . at 3.6 cm ,",
    "the average flux is 239@xmath1073@xmath11jy , with @xmath21 fit to the average returning @xmath22=2.3 ( 17 dof ) , indicating agreement at the 0.2% level for a constant source . at 6 cm ,",
    "the average flux is 278@xmath1063@xmath11jy , and a @xmath21 fit to the average yields @xmath22=1.2 ( 17 dof ) , indicating agreement at the 25% level for a constant source .",
    "we note that the time sampling , 10 minutes in each frequency band every 36 minutes , is relatively coarse , and this together with the low amplitude of the variation may affect the statistical significance .",
    "thus we can conclude that there is marginal evidence for variations of the signal from tvlm513 at 3.6 cm , but not 6 cm .",
    "previous observations of tvlm513 with the vla lasted 6200 seconds ( 23 september 2001 , reported in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 1350 seconds , respectively ( unpublished observations of 15 february 1994 ) .",
    "neither had a sufficient time baseline to identify variability on timescales @xmath23 2 hours ; it is unlikely that any periodicities could be seen in those data .",
    "adding the current observations to this time baseline reduces the flare duty cycle reported in @xcite , based on one flare lasting @xmath121500 s , to @xmath123% .",
    "the brightness temperatures inferred in  3.1 are too large for thermal bremsstrahlung emission to be the cause .",
    "particle acceleration , leading to gyrosynchrotron emission , is the more probable source .",
    "the spectral shape implies that frequencies greater than 5 ghz are optically thin , and the observed 58 ghz spectral index is compatible with optically thin emission from a relatively hard energy distribution with power law index @xmath242 or 3 .",
    "the radio characteristics of tvlm513 are very similar to those of active dme stars , in terms of spectral index and constraints on polarization levels .",
    "we investigate simple models for the coronal properties , under the assumption that the emission mechanism is gyrosynchrotron radiation from a population of mildly relativistic electrons : first , for a homogeneous source , and second , for a dipole magnetic field and radially varying nonthermal electron density .",
    "these two approaches give different , but consistent , results for the magnetic field strengths in the tvlm513 s corona and the total number density of accelerated particles .",
    "the turnover in spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz suggests that the spectral maximum is in this range .",
    "the spectral turnover could be due to a transition between optically thick / thin regimes ; if it is , the peak frequency of gyrosynchrotron emission depends on the magnetic field strength in the radio - emitting source , the source size , and index of the power - law distribution of nonthermal electrons .",
    "the strongest dependence of these parameters is from the magnetic field strength . for the simplest case of a homogeneous radio - emitting source ,",
    "we constrain the magnetic field strength using equation ( 39 ) of @xcite , setting @xmath25=2(3 ) , source size @xmath12r@xmath262r@xmath26 , and the total number density of nonthermal electrons above a cutoff value of 10 kev between 10@xmath2710@xmath28 @xmath29 . field strengths of a few hundred gauss are needed in a homogeneous radio - emitting source to produce a spectral turnover below 5 ghz due to optical depth effects .",
    "@xcite investigated simple non - thermal models for the quiescent radio emission from dme flare stars , using an analytic representation of the magnetic field and spatial inhomogeneities in the nonthermal electron density distribution .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be dipolar ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ) .",
    "the distribution of electrons with energy is parameterized as a power - law with index @xmath25 , and is assumed to vary radially with distance as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electron density distribution . combining these assumptions with the analytic expressions for absorption and emission coefficients of @xcite , expressions for the optically thick and thin radiative fluxes can be obtained .",
    "@xcite considered a global dipole , which they termed a `` bare '' dipole , and a `` buried dipole '' , in which the depth below the surface at which the dipole is buried is much less than a stellar radius .",
    "@xcite compared their analytic expressions with more accurate numerical calculations and conclude that both are within a factor of two of the numerical calculations .",
    "we use the analytic expressions to obtain a general description of coronal conditions which could be applicable to the case of tvlm513 .    in our case , we calculate the expected fluxes at the distance of tvlm513 ( 10.5 pc ) , specifying the frequency ( 1.4 , 5 , and 8 ghz ) , constraining @xmath25 to be 3 , and assuming only dipolar field configurations . for",
    "a harder electron energy spectrum ( @xmath34 ) the total integrated energy in fast electrons does not converge .",
    "this leaves four free parameters : the power - law index describing the radial dependence of the number density ( @xmath35 ) , the base magnetic field strength ( @xmath36 ) , the total surface number density ( @xmath37 ) , and the scale length of the dipole ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is @xmath40 ) .",
    "the @xmath41 case corresponds to a nonthermal electron distribution independent of radius , appropriate for an isotropic pitch angle distribution .",
    "the other extreme , @xmath42 , corresponds to the radial dependence of the electrons being the same as that of the dipolar magnetic field ; this is the situation that would be obtained by conserving both particle and magnetic flux in the case of open field lines .",
    "we require that the turnover frequency be @xmath145 ghz , based on the observational constraints .",
    "figure  [ fig : constraints ] shows the range of parameter space in base magnetic field strength and total nonthermal number density , for different combinations of @xmath35 and bare / buried dipoles which predict between 0.5 and 2 times the detected flux at 3.6 cm . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the predicted flux varies as @xmath44 .",
    "the turnover frequency likewise depends more strongly on the base magnetic field strength than the total number density of accelerated electrons .",
    "this places a constraint on the base magnetic field strength to be less than @xmath12500 g to satisfy the observed fluxes and spectral distribution . requiring the dipole to be buried at depths less than the stellar",
    "radius increases the number density of accelerated electrons needed to produce the same observed flux .",
    "the radio observations indicate little net polarization , but do not provide a stringent constraint on the global magnetic geometry : the upper limits on polarization could be consistent with small regions of magnetic field permeating the surface , or a large dipolar field with high inclination so that the net circular polarization signature is small .",
    "@xcite noted a relationship for rs cvn binary systems ( known to have large - scale magnetic fields ) in which the measured circular polarizations decrease with increasing inclination .",
    "the high rotational velocity might also suggest a nearly edge - on viewing geometry to see the maximum rotational broadening .",
    "there are various lines of evidence which suggest that similar activity is being displayed on late m dwarfs as is seen in the earlier m dwarfs : radio flares ; transition region and x - ray emission ( including flaring at these wavelengths ) ; and sporadic detections of h@xmath0 emission and flaring . to this list",
    "we can add quiescent radio emission with typical spectral indices of earlier m dwarfs and little to no circular polarization .",
    "longer term observations of ultracool dwarfs are needed to understand fully the nature of the radio emission and how commonly it occurs in these objects .",
    "a more comprehensive view of activity diagnostics in ultracool dwarfs is also needed to make sense of the broad changes seen in h@xmath0 emission trends , and to relate them to the physical changes taking place in these ultracool dwarf atmospheres .",
