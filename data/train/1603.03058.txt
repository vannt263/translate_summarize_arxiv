    "fan , katz , randall , and reece in 2013 proposed the existence of thin disks of dark matter in spiral galaxies including the milky way , in a model termed double disk dark matter ( dddm ) . in this model ,",
    "a small fraction of the dark matter is interacting and dissipative , so that this sector of dark matter would cool and form a thin disk .",
    "more recently @xcite showed that a dark matter disk of surface density @xmath0 and scale height @xmath110 pc could possibly explain the periodicity of comet impacts on earth .",
    "it is of interest to know what values of dark disk surface density and scale height are allowed by the current data , and whether these particular values are allowed .    since the original studies by @xcite",
    ", the question of disk dark matter has been a subject of controversy . over the years",
    ", several authors have suggested a dark disk to explain various phenomena . @xcite",
    "proposed a thick dark disk as a way to explain the flaring of the interstellar gas layer .",
    "it has also been argued that a thick dark disk is formed naturally in a @xmath2cdm cosmology as a consequence of sattelite mergers @xcite .",
    "besides these , there are also models arguing for a thin dark disk . @xcite put forward a model for dark matter where a small fraction of the total dark matter could be self - interacting and dissipative , necessarily forming a thin dark disk . in @xcite we investigated the constraints on such a disk from stellar kinematics . in this paper",
    "we investigate the contraint imposed by demanding consistency between measurements of midplane densities and surface densities interstellar gas .",
    "we assume a bahcall - type model for the vertical distributions of stars and gas @xcite as in @xcite , with various visible mass components , as well as a dark disk .",
    "we investigate the visible components in detail given more recent measurements of both the surface and midplane densities .",
    "a dark disk affects the relationship between the two as argued in @xcite and as we review below .",
    "although current measurements are insufficiently reliable to place strong constraints on or identify a disk , we expect this method will be useful in the future when better measurements are achieved .",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , for an axisymmetric self - gravitating system , the vertical jeans equation near the @xmath3 plane reads @xmath4 for an isothermal population ( @xmath5 ) , the solution reduces to @xmath6 combining this with the poisson equation gives the poisson - jeans equation for the potential @xmath7 @xmath8 which can also be cast in integral form ( assuming @xmath9-reflection symmetry ) @xmath10 this is the form used in our poisson - jeans solver .      in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the exact solution to the poisson - jeans equation for a thick component ( in this case , the interstellar gas which is thick compared to the dark disk ) with midplane density @xmath11 and vertical dispersion @xmath12 interacting with an infinitely thin ( delta - function profile ) dark disk was @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 thus , the effect of the dark disk is to ` pinch ' the density distribution of the other components , as we can see in figure [ fig : toy ] .",
    "thus , although the scale height of the gas disk is proportional to its velocity dispersion according to equation [ eq : disp ] , a dark disk will reduce the gas disk s thickness relative to this value , and for a fixed midplane density @xmath17 , it implies that their surface densities @xmath18 are less than what it would be without the dark disk or any other mass component . in this approximation",
    ", the gas distribution will have a cusp at the origin , but in general , the dark disk will have a finite thickness and the solution will be smooth near @xmath3 .    integrating ( [ eq : exact ] )",
    "gives the surface density of the visible component as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is what the surface density would have been without the dark disk .",
    "this expression is monotonically decreasing with @xmath21 .    another way of explaining this is that the dark disk ` pinches ' the visible matter disk , reducing its thickness @xmath22 . since the surface density of the visible disk scales roughly as @xmath23 , the effect of the dark disk is to reduce the total surface density for a given midplane density @xmath24 .",
    "here we explain how we compare the surface densities of the various gas components estimated in the next section to those predicted by their midplane densities and velocity dispersions in order to place self - consistency constraints on the mass model .",
    "section [ sec : toy ] explains how the presence of the dark disk decreases the surface density of each component if the midplane density is held fixed ( as it is in a poisson - jeans solver ) .",
    "thus , given fixed midplane densities , we can assign a probability to a model with any dark disk surface density @xmath21 and scale height @xmath25 based on how well the predicted surface densities @xmath18 determined from the poisson - jeans solver match the observed values .    starting with the midplane densities and dispersions of section [ sec : massmodel ]",
    ", we solved the poisson - jeans equation for @xmath21 values between 0 and 24 @xmath26 .",
    "each time the poisson - jeans equation was solved , the density distributions were integrated to give the total surface densities of @xmath27 and hi .",
    "each model was then assigned a probability , according to the chi - squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom , based on the deviation of this surface density from the measured values .",
    "we did this using different central values and uncertainties for the midplane densities .",
    "thus , for example , using @xmath28 , we would take @xmath29 .",
    "if for a model with this value of @xmath30 and with a certain dark disk surface density value of @xmath21 we find an h@xmath31 surface density @xmath32 , then according to section [ sec : h2 ] , we should assign this model a chi - squared value @xmath33 .",
    "we would then assign a probability to this model according to the gaussian cumulative distribution , @xmath34 , where the limits of integration are from @xmath35 to @xmath36 and @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we would similarly compute probabilities @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and a combined probability @xmath41 .",
    "we note here that this is not the absolute probability of the model given the data ; rather , it is the probability of the data given the model .",
    "we define a model for which the data is less probable than 5% to be excluded .",
    "an important question is what to use for @xmath42 .",
    "there are two uncertainties here .",
    "namely , 1 ) the uncertainty in the surface density measurements , @xmath43 , and 2 ) the uncertainty in our output values of @xmath44 , resulting from the uncertainty in the input midplane density measurements @xmath45 . formally ,",
    "this is @xmath46 .",
    "assuming gaussian distributions for the measurements @xmath47 and @xmath45 , and a uniform prior for @xmath21 , one can show that @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the true midplane densities , and that , expanding @xmath50 to first order in @xmath49 , this integrates to give an approximately gaussian distribution for @xmath51 , with width @xmath52 we computed @xmath53 by sampling values of @xmath49 and computing the output values @xmath18 .",
    "the effect of the uncertainties in the vertical dispersions of the different components was also included in @xmath54 in the same way as those in @xmath45 .",
    "the formula for @xmath54 that we adopt ( equation [ eq : delta ] ) therefore contains an extra term under the square root to include this uncertainty : @xmath55",
    "the purpose of this section is to determine accurate values for @xmath17 , @xmath56 , and @xmath18 ( midpalne density , velocity dispersion , and surface density ) for the different components of interstellar gas based on existing measurements . using equation [ eq : ideal ] , these",
    "can then be compared for a given dark disk model in order to check for self - consistency .",
    "we now discuss in detail the various measurements of the gas parameters and the uncertainties in each .",
    "our starting point is the bahcall model used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) .",
    "these values are updated from the ones used in @xcite .",
    "values for the stellar components were updated using the values of @xcite , and are shown in rows 5 - 15 in table 2 of @xcite .    in these models ,",
    "the gas and stars are both separated into approximately isothermal components as in @xcite , so that each component @xmath57 is characterized by a midplane density @xmath58 and a vertical dispersion @xmath56 . using only these values for all of the components",
    ", we can solve the poisson - jeans equation ( [ eq : poissonjeans2 ] ) for the system . a major difference between our model and that of @xcite is that their gas midplane densities were fixed by the values needed to give the correct surface densities in accordance with the poisson - jeans equation .",
    "we , on the other hand , use measured values of the midplane densities as we explain in this section .",
    "we explain the various literature values that were included in the determination of the gas parameters .",
    "we also compare these to the recent values of @xcite . in section [ sec : results ] , the analysis is conducted separately for the values we determine by combining the results in the literature and the values obtained solely from the recent paper by @xcite .",
    "we now explain the various measurements of the molecular hydrogen volume density and surface densities and how they are corrected . as molecular hydrogen",
    "can not be observed directly , it must be inferred from the amount of co present , derived from the intensity of the @xmath59 transition photons .",
    "these are related by the so - called @xmath60-factor , defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the line - of - sight column density of @xmath27 molecules and @xmath63 is the total , velocity - integrated co intensity along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "column densities perpendicular to the galactic plane can then be obtained by simple trigonometry : @xmath64 and volume densities can be obtained by dividing the intensity density in velocity space @xmath65 by the rotation curve gradient @xmath66 , or by estimating the distance along the line of sight using other means . the volume and surface densities",
    "can also both be found by fitting an assumed distribution to measurements of the gas vertical scale height @xmath67 .",
    "surface densities can then be given , for example , by @xmath68 on the other hand , a certain reference may not be measuring surface density directly .",
    "instead , they may be measuring the emissivity , @xmath69 from which , according to equation [ eq : x ] , we can obtain the volume density as @xmath70 if the authors also measured the vertical ( @xmath71direction ) distribution of the molecular hydrogen , then the surface mass density can be obtained according to @xmath72 for example , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the molecular hydrogen distribution gives the surface density as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is given by 1.06 , 1.13 , or 1.44 for a gaussian , @xmath75 , or exponential profile respectively . for our calculations",
    ", we used @xmath76 as a reasonable estimate for the shape of the distribution .    in the literature , mass values",
    "are often quoted including the associated helium , metals , and other gaseous components such as co , etc .",
    "the amount of helium accompanying the hydrogen is typically assumed in the range 36 - 40% of the hydrogen alone by mass @xcite . including other gas components increases this number to about 42% @xcite .",
    "thus , the total mass of any component of the ism should be about 1.42 times the mass of its hydrogen . these will be distinguished by using , e.g. @xmath77 , @xmath78 to refer to the bare values and and the values including their associated helium respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath79 note that @xcite did not include helium in the total ism mass .",
    "also @xcite did not distinguish between hi results including and not including helium .",
    "we now explain how we obtain midplane volume densities @xmath80 and surface densities @xmath78 from the various references in the literature .",
    "@xcite measured the molecular hydrogen over different radii within the solar circle .",
    "their data are shown as one of the data sets in figure [ fig : nh2 ] .",
    "averaging the values from the northern and souther galactic plane in table 4 of the latter , we find , for the measurements closest to the sun , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "since surface densities depend only on the total integrated intensity along the line of sight , they are independent of the value of @xmath83 , the sun s radial position from the center of the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "it follows from this that old values for volume densities ( which scale as @xmath84 ) must be rescaled by @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "since @xcite used the old value @xmath86 kpc , this value needs to be rescaled by @xmath87 to take into account the new value of @xmath88 kpc @xcite .",
    "they also used an @xmath60-factor of @xmath89 .",
    "we correct this using a more recent value of @xmath90 , obtained by @xcite .",
    "the most recent value of @xmath60 , obtained by okumura & kamae ( @xcite ) , is @xmath91 , although the value of dame et al .",
    "that we use is still cited by @xcite as the most reliable .",
    "these corrections give @xmath92 and @xmath93 . including helium",
    "gives @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite , found the local co emissivity @xmath95 in the first galactic quadrant for radii through @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively , they found these to be @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which , using @xmath100 @xmath101 , and rescaling for @xmath83 by @xmath87 , gives interpolated density @xmath102 . using their fwhm measurements for @xmath27",
    ", we can convert their measurements to surface density values according to equation [ eq : cnf ] .",
    "as before , the surface density values are independent of @xmath83 .",
    "we have , interpolating to @xmath83 , @xmath103 .",
    "the rescaled data are shown in figure [ fig : nh2 ] .",
    "another measurement is provided by @xcite , who had already measured galactic co emissivity @xmath95 between @xmath104 kpc , assuming @xmath86 kpc , from which we obtain @xmath105 after correcting for @xmath83 , shown in figure [ fig : nh2 ] .",
    "interpolating linearly , this gives @xmath106 .",
    "@xcite also measured co in the first and second galactic quadrants within and outside the solar circle .",
    "they used the values @xmath86 kpc and @xmath107 @xmath101 .",
    "their results for both volume and surface density , corrected to @xmath108 kpc and @xmath100 @xmath101 , are also shown in figure [ fig : nh2 ] .",
    "in particular , after rescaling and interpolating their volume densities , we have @xmath109 . for surface density ,",
    "we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "this is the highest value in the literature .",
    "@xcite also measured co in the outer galaxy , which , with a 1.8/2.8 correction factor for @xmath60 , as well as correcting @xmath83 from 10 to 8.33 kpc , their results near the sun read @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "@xcite also measured @xmath27 in the outer galaxy .",
    "using his results , we find @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite , by directly observing clouds within 1 kpc of the sun only , found local volume density @xmath115 and surface density @xmath116 , which , correcting for @xmath117 to @xmath118 , gives @xmath119 and @xmath120 . this volume density is lower than many other measurements , and",
    "may represent a local fluctuation in the solar region on a larger scale than the local bubble . on the other hand ,",
    "their surface density value is not the lowest .",
    "@xcite , using @xmath121 , found @xmath122 .",
    "correcting for @xmath60 gives @xmath123 , which is the lowest value in the literature .",
    "however , they admit that their values beyond @xmath124 are uncertain .",
    "another determination from 2006 @xcite gives , after interpolation , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , or @xmath127 .",
    "figure [ fig : nh2 ] shows the various measurements described here , as well as the overall average and standard error . although not all measurements are equally certain , in computing average values for @xmath128 and @xmath77 we treated all measurements with equal weight .",
    "we estimated the resulting uncertainty as the standard deviation divided by the the square root of the number of measurements available at each @xmath129 .",
    "we found the mean values and standard errors of volume and surface densities near the sun to be @xmath130 this analysis has not yet taken into account the more recent observations of a significant component of molecular gas that is not associated with co @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimates this `` dark gas '' density to be 118% that of the co - associated @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , found roughly 40% at solar radius .",
    "we therefore include the dark molecular gas with a mean value of 79% and with an uncertainty of 39% .",
    "this gives total molecular gas estimates of @xmath131which are the values we assume for our analysis .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in propagating the errors for dark gas , @xmath132 and @xmath133 always vary together .",
    "we take this into account in the statistical analysis by considering only the error on the ratio @xmath134 .",
    "the same would apply to the error in @xmath135 although this error is much smaller .",
    "+ [ fig : nh2 ]    besides the molecular hydrogen s volume density @xmath128 and surface density @xmath77 , another important quantity is its cloud - cloud velocity dispersion @xmath136 , since this is one of the inputs in the poisson - jeans equation .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the molecular clouds containing @xmath27 can be inferred from that of their co , which was found by @xcite to be @xmath137 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath138 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath139 .",
    "the weighted average of these is approximately given by    @xmath140    ",
    "we now discuss the various measurements of atomic hydrogen hi volume density @xmath141 and surface density @xmath142 .",
    "these typically are made by observing emissions of hydrogen s 21 cm hyperfine transition .",
    "@xcite estimate an hi surface density of 8.2 @xmath26 near the sun .",
    "they separate hi into the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "@xcite , summarizing several earlier studies , describe the galactic hi as having approximately constant properties over the range @xmath143 .",
    "their best estimate for the hi parameters over this range is a combination of subcomponents , one thin gaussian component with central density @xmath144 and fwhm = 212 pc ( and surface density 2.2@xmath26 ) , which we identify with the cnm , and a thicker component with central density @xmath145 and surface density 2.8@xmath26 , which we identify as the wnm .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath146 , or @xmath147 .",
    "another measurement is provided by @xcite , who measured volume densities for @xmath148 .",
    "we interpolate their data ( and correct for @xmath149 ) to obtain @xmath150 .",
    "although they did not determine surface densities , we can estimate them by assuming a single gaussian component with fwhm given dickey & lockman ( 220 - 230 pc ) .",
    "a better estimate is perhaps obtained by assuming , rather than a gaussian distribution , a distribution with the same shape as dickey & lockman .",
    "this amounts to assuming an effective gaussian fwhm of @xmath151 pc .",
    "this gives a surface density near the sun of @xmath152 .",
    "@xcite , however , argues that the midplane density of dickey & lockman was artificially enhanced to give the correct surface density .",
    "he measures midplane density @xmath153 , which , assuming as for burton & gordon a gaussian distribution with effective fwhm @xmath154 pc , gives a surface density of only @xmath155 .",
    "@xcite also measured the galactic hi , from the galactic center out to @xmath156 .",
    "their results are shown in figure [ fig : nhi ] .",
    "interpolating to @xmath83 , we have @xmath157 and @xmath158 , in agreement with the value of burton & gordon .",
    "on the other hand , there are several authors who report much larger mass parameters for galactic hi .",
    "they are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used 21 cm observations from outside the solar circle .",
    "their data are shown in figure [ fig : nhi ] .",
    "closest to the sun , their data show @xmath159 with a fwhm of 300 pc .",

    "the kalberla & dedes data ( also shown in figure [ fig : nhi ] ) show @xmath161 .",
    "a more refined estimate gives @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a midplane density of roughly @xmath163 .",
    "this is much higher than the value of @xcite , who obtained @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "however , there is reason to expect a relatively high hi midplane density . based on extinction studies",

    "optical thickness corrections , which we explain below , increase this number to 0.84 @xmath171 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : nhi ] .",
    "as in the case of molecular hydrogen , all measurements were treated with equal weight and the uncertainty was estimated as the standard error at each @xmath129 .    combining all these results",
    ", we have , in the absence of optical thickness corrections , @xmath172in the @xcite model , 70% of this hi midplane density is in cnm and the remaining 30% is wnm . in @xcite ,",

    "we will take the average of these two results , 72.5% and 27.5% , which give @xmath173 and @xmath174    @xcite pointed out that these numbers must be corrected for the optical depth of the cnm . assuming the cnm to be optically thin leads to an underestimation of the cnm column density by a factor @xmath175 .",

    "gives @xmath178 with totals @xmath179 which we use for this analysis .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite argues that the model of @xcite is more accurate , and recommends increasing the amount of hi in the ism by a factor of 7.45/6.2 .",

    "the averages of these values are @xmath191      besides the h@xmath31 and the two types of hi ( cnm and wnm ) , there is a fourth , warm , ionized component of interstellar hydrogen , denoted hii . @xcite and @xcite included this component .",

    "we describe a second possible model to describe the magnetic and cosmic ray pressures in the interstellar medium .",
    "namely , it has been observed that within the cnm , energy densities in magnetic fields and in turbulence are often roughly equal @xcite .",
    "although the ratio between these energies is observed to vary greatly over different molecular clouds , this so - called `` energy equipartition '' seems to be obeyed on average .",
    "physically , this happens because the turbulence amplifies the magnetic field until it becomes strong enough to dissipate through van alfvn waves .",
    "similarly , we expect magnetic fields to trap cosmic rays within the gas until they become too dense and begin to escape .",

    "for these reasons , an alternative to the first model ( equation [ eq : alpha ] ) would be to assume equipartition of pressure between turbulence , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays : @xmath224 for each component @xmath57 .",
    "the effective dispersion , which is the sum of turbulent , magnetic , cosmic ray , and thermal contributions , would then be @xmath225 for each component .",
    "one important factor that we should not overlooked here , however , is that the molecular hydrogen and cnm condense to form clouds .",
    "thus , although turbulence , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays may affect the size of the individual clouds , we expect the overall scale height of the cold components to be determined only by the cloud - cloud dispersion and not by these forces .",
    "we therefore assume equations [ eq : equipartition]-[eq:3s ] only for the warm components wnm and hii .",
    "for the cold components ( @xmath27 and cnm ) , we assume @xmath226 .",
    "we perform calculations separately for the two different magnetic field and cosmic ray models .",
    "the effective dispersions in both models are shown in table [ tab : disp ] .",
    "as we will see , the results from both models are in good agreement with one another .",
    "we now present the results of the analysis described above . using the midplane densities of section [ sec : massmodel ] , we calculate according to the poisson - jeans equation the corresponding @xmath27 and hi surface densities , and from these we compute the chi - squared value , @xmath227 , from the disagreement between these values and the measured values .",
    "this is done over a range of values for @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "we thereby determine the regions of parameter space where the disagreement exceeds the 68% and 95% bounds , as will be displayed in the plots below .",
    "the scale height @xmath25 is defined such that @xmath228    we begin by determining the bounds without including the contribution from magnetic fields and cosmic rays . the result is shown in figure [ fig : nomag_kramer ] .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath27 is dominated by that of the dark molecular gas , while the uncertainty of hi is dominated by that of the wnm velocity dispersion ( 18% ) .",
    "we can see that although the @xmath27 parameters are consistent with dark disk surface densities of ( for low scale height ) up to @xmath229 , the hi parameters point toward lower surface densities , and that the combined probabilities are lower than 9% for all models .",
    "these results make it apparent that the model without magnetic fields is inconsistent .    on the other hand ,",
    "when we include the pressure contribution from the magnetic fields and from cosmic rays , we find that both the hi and @xmath27 parameters allow non - zero surface densities @xmath21 , with an upper bound of @xmath230 in both models , for low scale heights .",
    "higher scale heights are consistent with even higher dark disk surface densities .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : mag_kramer ] .    for comparison",
    ", we also include the corresponding results using the values of @xcite .",
    "using these values and including magnetic fields and cosmic ray contributions , the data favors a non - zero surface density for the dark disk of between 5 and 15@xmath26 .",
    "note that when neglecting magnetic field and cosmic rays pressures , only low dark disk surface densities seem consistent with the data .      as was mentioned in section [ sec : hii ] , various authors have measured dm values for the hii component of the milky way in the range 20 - 30 @xmath231 .",
    "older models favored low scale height with midplane densities as high as @xmath232 , while newer models favor large scale height models with midplane densities as low as @xmath233 .",
    "however , using our model , the results of our poisson - jeans solver are consistent with only low scale heights . following the models described in section [ sec : other ] ,",
    "we find scale heights for the hii of 0.9 kpc for the thermal scaling model and 1.0 kpc for the warm equipartition model , assuming @xmath234 .",
    "incorporating a more massive dark disk makes these scale heights smaller .",
    "possible reasons for this might be : + 1 ) the magnetic field model must be modified to include a different value of @xmath235 for hii .",
    "this could be in correspondence with the result of @xcite , who found that galactic magnetic fields contained two components , one with short scale height and one with larger scale height .",
    "these two components would likely be described by different @xmath235 .",
    "we could then attribute the low scale height component to the molecular and atomic gas and the large scale height component to the ionized gas .",
    "we know of no such alternative in the warm equipartition model .",
    "+ 2 ) the isothermal assumption may not be valid for hii .",
    "in fact , as explained in @xcite , the volume filling fraction of hii may also vary a lot with scale height .",
    "if this is the case , then it would be incorrect to treat the hii as an isothermal component as the degrees of freedom that the temperature describes ( the gas clouds ) vary with distance from the galactic midplane .      in figure 7",
    "we show the bound we obtained from the kinematics of a stars in the solar region , accounting for nonequilibrium features of the population , namely a net displacement and vertical velocity relative to the galactic midplane .",
    "we also note that there will exist disk stability bounds .",
    "the true analysis is subtle , but a step toward the analysis is done by @xcite who develops the stability criterion for a heterogeneous milky way disk including a thin dark matter disk .",
    "we convert his bound to a bound in the @xmath236 plane and superimpose this bound on the gas parameter bound of the present work .",
    "we see that a disk with significant mass ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath237 pc is consistent with all current bounds .",
    "in addition to stability issues , @xcite has argued that there exist other issues with using the vertical jeans equation to constrain the dynamical mass in the mw disk . in particular ,",
    "spiral structure must be taken into account when performing these analyses .",
    "indeed , @xcite has pointed out that the effect of spiral arm crossing is to induce a ` ringing ' in the dynamics of tracer stars .",
    "however , the present analysis assumes that the time scales for this ringing are much shorter in gas components so that the analysis is valid",
    ". spiral arm crossing could also induce non - equilibrium features in the tracer population , such as discussed in @xcite , but as in @xcite , including this effect would allow for more dark matter .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to use measured midplane and surface densities of various galactic plane components to constrain or discover a dark disk .",
    "although literature values of atomic hydrogen midplane densities are discordant , their mean value is consistent with the remaining gas parameters when magnetic and cosmic ray pressures are included . using the global averages of literature values of gas parameters that we compiled , we find the data are consistent with dark disk surface densities as high as @xmath238 for low scale height , and as low as zero .",
    "the gas parameters of @xcite seem to favor an even higher non - zero dark disk surface density .",
    "current data are clearly inadequate to decide this definitively",
    ". further measurements of visible and dark @xmath27 density and wnm density and dispersion , as well as further refinements of magnetic field and cosmic ray models for cold gas could allow placing more robust bounds on a dark disk .",
