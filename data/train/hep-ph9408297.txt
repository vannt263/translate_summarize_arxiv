    "the standard model(sm ) has achieved a great success recent years .",
    "however , there is still a vast interest beyond standard model .",
    "one of the most simple extensions of the standard model is to add another higgs doublet .",
    "this may be viewed as inevitable since many attempts at going beyond the sm leads to an enlargement of the higgs sector ( such as supersymmetry model ) .",
    "it is of interest to study the 2-higgs doublet model , hence to constrain other models .",
    "the decay @xmath5 is one of the very useful channel for study of models beyond standard model@xcite .",
    "recently the cleo collaboration has observed@xcite the exclusive decay @xmath6 with a branching fraction of @xmath7 .",
    "a new upper limit on the inclusive @xmath8 process is also obtained as @xmath9 at 95% c.l.@xcite .",
    "this leads to a number of papers@xcite regarding this decay recently .",
    "it has been argued that the experimental result is more close to standard model predictions and provides more information about restrictions on models beyond sm .",
    "this deeply depends on more precise calculations of this decay .",
    "the decay of @xmath10 and its large leading log qcd corrections have already been calculated in many papers@xcite . due to many reasons , there are discrepancies among these papers , although there is not much differences in numerical results . until recently , ciuchini , franco , reina and silvestrini@xcite performed this calculation in three regularization schemes , to solve this problem completely . and also some efforts are made to give a next to leading log calculations@xcite which is estimated within 20% contribution .",
    "all these efforts make it easy for calculations of this decay in models beyond sm .",
    "the radiative @xmath11 quark decay in 2-higgs doublet model has also been calculated in several papers@xcite .",
    "it is found to be strongly qcd - enhanced . in other words ,",
    "the strong interaction plays an important role in this decay . however , there are still some uncertainties in these papers .",
    "all these papers do not include the qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "since the top quark is found to be 2-times heavier than w boson ( @xmath12 gev @xcite ) , and the charged higgs is also expected to be heavier(in supersymmetry model @xmath13 ) , it needs a detailed calculation of this effect .    in our present paper , by using effective field theory formalism , we recalculate the @xmath5 decay in 2-higgs doublet model including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , in addition to corrections from @xmath2 to @xmath4 , so as to give a complete leading log results . in the next section ,",
    "we first integrate out the top quark and charged higgs , generating an effective five - quark theory . by using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we run the effective field theory down to the w - scale . in section 3 ,",
    "the weak bosons are removed .",
    "then we continue running the effective field theory down to b - quark scale to include qcd corrections from @xmath2 to @xmath4 . in section 4",

    "restrictions of model parameters from experiments of cleo collaboration are also given .",
    "section 5 is a short summary .",
    "with two higgs doublets , one has to avoid tree - level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) due to neutral higgs bosons .",
    "this is usually achieved in two ways , each involving some discrete symmetry .",
    "the first way ( model i ) is to allow only one higgs doublet to couple to both types of quarks@xcite .",
    "the second way ( model ii ) is to couple only one higgs doublet to u - type quarks while the other couples only to d - type quarks@xcite .",
    "it is of interest to note that model ii occurs as a natural feature in theories with supersymmetry or a peccei - quinn type of symmetry .",

    "if we take experimental result @xmath106@xcite , the branching ratios of @xmath107 is found .",
    "the decay results are summarized in fig.7 and fig.8 as functions of @xmath81 , with different charged higgs mass 170gev , 300gev , 600gev and 900gev .",

    "the suppression is 23% .",
    "as @xmath109 , this kind of model goes back to sm . in this small @xmath110 region , the qcd corrections give 7% enhancement which corresponding to sm case@xcite .",
    "therefore , the restrictions to this model parameters are less tight than previous predictions especially for large values of @xmath110 . in fig.7",
    ", one can see that , for lower mass of charged higgs , small values of @xmath81 are still allowed .",
    "the parameter space is still open .",
    "the decay channel @xmath111 can still exist for a wide region .",
    "the decay rates in 2-higgs doublet model ii are enhanced up to 5% more than previous calculations when charged higgs mass is lower than 800 gev .",
    "although this percentage is not very large , the absolute values of the decay rates are sure higher . in fig.8 , one can easily see that , as charged higgs mass lower than 700gev , all values of @xmath81 are excluded by cleo s @xmath5 experiments . for larger charged higgs mass ,",
    "small value of @xmath81 is still allowed .",
    "it is obvious that , the top decay channel @xmath111 is already ruled out in this kind of 2-higgs doublet model .    in the supersymmetry model",
    ", the higgs sector is the same as model ii , but the large chargino contribution cancels much the charged higgs contribution@xcite .",
    "there is sure a suppression of decay rates from 2-higgs doublet model ii .",
    "the magnitude is more complicated , since it depends on various supersymmetry models and chargino mass . when chargino mass is of order o(@xmath1 ) or higher , it should be integrated out at @xmath112 ; if it is of order o(@xmath2 ) or lower , it should be integrated out at @xmath58 scale",
    ". further more , for a complete supersymmetry calculation , there are also contributions from other susy particles which need a detailed calculation@xcite .",
    "as a conclusion , we have given the full leading log qcd corrections(including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) to @xmath113 decay in 2-kind 2-higgs doublet models .",
    "the qcd running from @xmath82 to @xmath2 suppresses the @xmath113 decay rate in model i , and enhances the decay rate in model ii .",
    "although this result is not quite different from the previous calculations , our improvements lie in reducing some theoretical uncertainties .",
    "after these changes , restrictions from @xmath10 decay to 2-higgs doublet model parameters are less strict in model i and more tight in model ii than previous predictions .",
    "it is shown that the decay @xmath10 is by far the most restrictive process in constraining the parameters of the charged higgs boson sector in 2-higgs doublet model .    _",
    "note added : _    after this paper was submitted for publication , the paper@xcite by h. anlauf came to our attention ; the author studied the supersymmetric contributions as well as charged higgs contributions in 2hd model ii .",
    "our results consist of 2-kinds of 2hd models ; and agree with their result of model ii at leading order(@xmath114 , @xmath115 ) .",
    "further more , we also included high order contribution which can not be neglected(in ref.@xcite , this was picked up later after running to @xmath2 scale to match onto results without qcd running from @xmath82 to @xmath2 ) .",
