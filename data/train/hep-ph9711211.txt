    "kaon decays are an important laboratory @xcite to understand weak interactions , chiral dynamics and cp violation .",
    "present and future experiments will definitely improve our knowledge in this area @xcite .",
    "the natural framework to study kaon decays is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) @xcite , where matrix elements , consistent with chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking ( @xmath8 plus eight goldstone bosons to be identified with the octet of lightest pseudoscalar mesons ) , are written as a perturbative expansion in masses and external momenta . at leading @xmath9 current algebra features like pcac",
    "are recovered .    at next @xmath0 @xcite a loop expansion , required by unitarity , and local operators , consistent with chiral symmetry ,",
    "the divergent part of the coefficients of these local operators are needed to reabsorb divergences in the loop contributions and thus are called counterterms .",
    "the finite part of a counterterm has to be determined from the phenomenology or through extra theoretical assumptions @xcite ( and references therein )",
    ".    vector meson dominance ( vmd ) has proven to be very efficient in describing the coefficients of the @xmath0 strong lagrangian @xcite , giving a good agreement with the phenomenology .",
    "however vmd in the strong sector is implemented automatically at @xmath0 only by the antisymmetric formulation of the vectors @xcite while in the usual vector formulation has to be just imposed .",
    "this is not necessarily the case at higher chiral orders where the conventional vector formulation is able to recover structures required by qcd that the antisymmetric formulation does not generate @xcite",
    ".    we will be interested here in the study of the spin1 resonance contributions to non  leptonic kaon decays in the @xmath7pt framework .",
    "some of these processes receive contributions already at @xmath9 ( that are not generated by resonance exchange ) with sizable @xmath0 corrections , like @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "others start at @xmath0 , like @xmath12 , @xmath13 , direct emission in @xmath14 , ... the full weak @xmath0 counterterm structure has been analysed @xcite and there are already interesting counterterm coefficient relations to be considered @xcite",
    ". the question of the dominance of vector meson exchange in weak decays has not yet a clear answer due to the unknown weak couplings of vector and axial  vector mesons .",
    "thus one has to rely on models to make quantitative predictions .",
    "the expansion in inverse power of number of colours ( @xmath15 ) has motivated several researches @xcite ( and references therein ) and their consequences for the @xmath0 weak chiral lagrangian have been studied by direct evaluation of the full short distance weak hamiltonian in the large @xmath16 limit and then bosonizing in terms of the lightest degrees of freedom i.e. the golstone boson fields @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the @xmath0 weak chiral lagrangian generated by resonance exchange has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where vectors and axial ",
    "vectors are implemented in the antisymmetric formulation and then the factorization model ( fm ) , justified by @xmath15 arguments , has been used .",
    "several predictions and useful relations have been found in this way @xcite .",
    "the questions we address here are :    * do these relations depend on the vector realization ?",
    "what about if we use the conventional vector formulation instead of the antisymmetric one ?",
    "* what is the relative rle of the factorization hypothesis in the two formulations ?",
    "we will see that the answers provide new results relevant for the phenomenology of most of the processes involved .",
    "moreover we will conclude that the model dependence ( factorization ) of the results is very much suppressed if the vector formulation of the resonance fields is used .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we review the @xmath7pt formalism in its strong and weak sectors .",
    "we also collect and analyse critically the main results of previous work on this topic that we would like to compare with . in section 3",
    "we deduce the @xmath0 weak chiral lagrangian as generated by vector and axial  vector contributions in the conventional vector formulation .",
    "we compare our results with the ones achieved by the antisymmetric formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 4 the relevant phenomenological implications of our new results are pointed out .",
    "we report our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "a brief appendix complements the main text .",
    "in this section we first review the formulation of @xmath7pt in the treatment of the strong and weak interactions .",
    "we also analyse the previous results of the spin1 resonance exchange generated @xmath0 weak chiral lagrangian using the factorization model when the antisymmetric field formulation of the resonance fields is implemented .",
    "@xmath7pt @xcite is the effective quantum field theory for the study of low energy strong interacting processes .",
    "it relies in the exact @xmath17 global chiral symmetry of massless qcd .",
    "this symmetry group is assumed to break spontaneously to @xmath18 generating an octet of goldstone bosons that are identified with the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite it turns out convenient to introduce the goldstone bosons @xmath19 , @xmath20 through the @xmath21 matrix @xmath22 , which also parameterizes the coset space @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the @xmath21 gell  mann matrices . ] and @xmath26 is the decay constant of the pion .",
    "the transformation under @xmath27 @xmath28 is @xmath29 where the compensator field @xmath30 has been introduced .",
    "green functions and symmetry breaking terms can be more easily generated by promoting the global symmetry to a local one , introducing external fields .",
    "a covariant derivative on the @xmath31 field is then defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are the left and right external fields , respectively , in terms of the external vector and axial fields .",
    "the leading @xmath35 strong lagrangian is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the flavour space . in the definition of @xmath7 , @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are the scalar and pseudoscalar external fields .",
    "starting at @xmath0 the strong chiral lagrangian has two well differentiated components corresponding to vertices generating even and odd  intrinsic parity transitions .",
    "the @xmath0 even  intrinsic parity lagrangian @xmath41 was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be written as @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 are local operators in terms of the pseudoscalar and external fields .",
    "the couplings @xmath45 are rather well determined phenomenologically while @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not because the associate operators only involve external fields and therefore do not contribute to low ",
    "energy processes with pseudoscalars .",
    "the @xmath0 odd  intrinsic parity lagrangian arises as a solution to the ward condition imposed by the chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of other quantum fields than the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons in the chiral lagrangian was also considered in ref .",
    "we are interested in the introduction of vector and axial  vector resonances coupled to the non - linear realization of the goldstone bosons @xmath22 and to the external fields .",
    "it is well known that the incorporation of spin1 mesons in the chiral lagrangian is not unique and several realizations of the field can be employed @xcite .",
    "in particular the antisymmetric formulation of vector fields was seen to implement automatically vector meson dominance at @xmath0 in @xmath7pt @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown that , at @xmath0 in @xmath7pt , once high energy qcd constraints are taken into account , the usual realizations ( antisymmetric , vector , yang  mills and hidden formulations ) give equivalent low ",
    "energy effective actions .",
    "although the antisymmetric tensor formulation of spin1 mesons was proven to have a better high  energy behaviour than the vector field realization at @xmath0 this fact is not necessarily the case at higher orders .",
    "in fact for the odd  intrinsic parity action relevant in @xmath48 decays the antisymmetric tensor formulation gives a leading contribution at @xmath0 while qcd requires explicit @xmath49 terms that are provided by the vector formulation @xcite .",
    "the analogous situation in the weak sector has not been studied yet .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the antisymmetric fields in their study of the vmd @xmath0 weak chiral lagrangian .",

    "( [ eq : evf],[eq : eaf ] ) ) is very rich .",
    "this is at odds with the antisymmetric formulation , where the opposite is true : constrained strong lagrangian and rich weak lagrangian .",
    "this is due to the relatively different chiral power at which both sectors ( strong and weak ) get their leading contribution .",
    "since we know better ( from a phenomenological point of view ) the strong and electromagnetic decays of vector mesons , we think that our procedure is in better shape to give more information with less assumptions . in this work and when necessary we have relied on models ( typically enjl @xcite ) to get the strong couplings , but these are more under control than the weak couplings of vectors and in any case experiments should be able to determine the full strong sector in the near future . due to our very restrictive weak lagrangian for vectors and axial ",
    "vectors , all the results obtained in factorization in the antisymmetric formulation are obtained by us but without the use of factorization ( for @xmath99 and @xmath100 see section 3 ) .",
