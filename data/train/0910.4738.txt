    "reachability analysis of deterministic dynamical systems constitutes a practically important and intensely researched area in control theory . over the years",
    ", a wide variety of tools and methods have been developed to verify the dynamic properties of these systems , for examples see @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the reachability problems considered are solved via dynamic programming ( dp ) . as a result , a large number of exact and approximate methods for solving the central _ bellman equation _ in dp @xcite can be exploited for the solution of verification problems of deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "recently , reachability analysis of stochastic markovian processes has gained significant interest , and mechanisms for the verification of safety and performance properties by means of a control policy have been explored .",
    "an example of such a problem is to find the probability , starting from a certain state @xmath0 , of reaching a `` safe '' set within a certain number of time - steps , where the state @xmath0 could be labelled `` almost safe '' if such probability is greater than , say , @xmath1",
    ". a related problem , which has been studied recently by some of the authors , is that of _ maximizing the probability of reaching a `` safe '' set , while avoiding a `` bad '' set _  @xcite .",
    "this problem arose as a remedy for the impossibility of imposing hard state constraints in stochastic model predictive control .",
    "in general , if one considers an infinite trajectory of a stochastic system , every compact state - constraint set is going to be violated almost surely at some time .",
    "thus , a good course of action when this happens is to devise a recovery strategy to drive the controlled system from the `` unsafe '' states back to the set of `` safe '' states .",
    "if a control variable is unavailable or a control policy has been predetermined , the verification of the stochastic system reduces to calculating the likelihood of the occurance of certain events . in this manner",
    ", the above problem is directly related to stochastic model checking of _ finite_-state markov models in that the analysis involves both reachability and likelihood computations .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider an extension of probabilistic computation tree logic ( pctl ) , a modal logic developed for _ finite_-state markov chains , which forms the foundation for the automated verification tools for _ finite_-state markov models , to general state - space markov chains .",
    "algorithms for stochastic model checking _",
    "finite_-state markov models come from standard deterministic model checking , linear algebra , and the analysis of markov chains .",
    "finite state model checkers include the software tools prism @xcite , smart @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , and mrmc @xcite , and have been used to solve various problems over the last few years . in the area of systems biology , probabilistic model checking has been used in the analysis of biological pathways @xcite and signalling events @xcite .",
    "additional examples of the use of stochastic model checking include the probabilistic verification of security protocols @xcite , dynamic power management @xcite , and residual risks in safety - critical systems @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the verification of general state - space markov chains through an extension of the standard grammar and semantics of pctl to non - countable - state markov chains ( the reader can find a similar extension in @xcite ) . as with the finite case",
    ", the evaluation of a pctl formula can be recursively reduced to the truth of atomic propositions by employing computations dictated by the pctl semantics . in this process of reduction , certain rules of the semantics simply stipulate unions or intersections of sets , while others involve the computation of integrals .",
    "it is in the computation of the integrals where the bulk of the algorithmic methodology is contained .",
    "we show that the `` bounded until '' operator , which considers the property of hitting a `` safe '' from an `` unsafe '' set over a finite time horizon , can be evaluated through a dynamic recursion .",
    "additionally , we prove that the `` unbounded until '' operator , which considers the property of hitting a `` safe '' set from an `` unsafe '' set at some point in time , can be evaluated via a dp - like _ bellman equation_. further , we emphasize that , while in the numerical examples provided we grid the state space in order to solve the integral equations , any method in the literature for the numerical computation of a dp can be exploited for this problem .",
    "_ outline of the work _ : in section [ section_pctl ] we review the standard grammar and semantics of pctl for finite - state markov chains . in section [ section_pctl_general ]",
    "we extend the grammar and semantics of pctl to general state - space markov chains . the uniqueness of a certain function associated with the `` unbounded until '' property is considered in section [ section_stopping_times ] .",
    "finally , section [ section_examples ] concludes the paper with some applications and numerical examples .",
    "in this section we quickly review the definition and semantics of pctl for finite - state markov chains .",
    "the reader is referred to the original paper @xcite or to the excellent survey @xcite for a detailed exposition .",
    "+      a homogeneous , discrete - time , finite - state markov chain is a triple @xmath3 , where :    * @xmath4 is a finite set of states ; * @xmath5 is the initial state ; * @xmath6 is a _ transition probability matrix _ , which assigns to each pair of states @xmath7 the probability @xmath8 of going from the state @xmath9 to the state @xmath10 at a given time .",
    "consider the sample space @xmath11 , containing the possible trajectories @xmath12 of the chain , and the product @xmath13-algebra @xmath14 on @xmath15 .",
    "for a given trajectory @xmath12 , let @xmath16",
    ". it can be shown  @xcite that there exists a unique probability measure on @xmath17 , denoted by @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "[ definition_lmc ] let @xmath21 be a finite set of _ atomic propositions_. a _ labelled _ markov chain is a quadruple @xmath22 , where :    * @xmath3 is a finite - state markov chain ; * @xmath23 is a set - valued function that assigns to each state @xmath24 the set @xmath25 of all those atomic propositions that are true in the state .",
    "the grammar of pctl is as follows :    * @xmath26 is a formula ( meaning `` true '' ) . *",
    "each atomic proposition in @xmath27 is a formula . *",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are formulas , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 are formulas . *",
    "if @xmath32 is a `` _ path formula _ '' ( see below ) and @xmath33 $ ] , then @xmath34}}$ ] is a ( _ state _ ) formula . here and throughout the rest of the paper ,",
    "@xmath35 is just shortand for one of the relations @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .",
    "for example , @xmath40}$ ] is one such formula , where `` @xmath35 ''  @xmath41  `` @xmath39 '' and @xmath42 .",
    "the above grammar defines _ state _ formulas , that is , formulas whose truth can be decided for each state @xmath43 .",
    "the meaning of the formulas in the first three points is the usual one in the standard logic of propositions .",
    "the other standard formulas and operators can be obtained by means of combinations of the above ones .",
    "for example , @xmath44 ( `` false '' ) can be defined as @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( `` inclusive or '' ) as @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( formal implication ) as @xmath49 .",
    "the last kind of formula is what makes pctl a _",
    "modal _ logic ,",
    "since it allows to express the fact that , with _ probability _ contained in some range , something will happen in",
    "_ time_. it relies on the definition of _ path _ formulas , that is , formulas whose truth is decided for paths @xmath50 .",
    "a formula like @xmath51}$ ] means , intuitively , that the probability of taking a path that satisfies @xmath32 is at least @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are _ state _ formulas , we define the following to be _ path _ formulas :    * @xmath53   ( `` next '' ) ; * @xmath54  ( `` bounded until '' ) ; * @xmath55  ( `` unbounded until '' ) .    intuitively , @xmath53 means that next state will satisfy @xmath28 ; @xmath54 means that at some time @xmath56 , within @xmath57 steps , @xmath29 will become true , and until that time @xmath28 will remain true ; and @xmath55 means that at some arbitrarily large time @xmath56 , @xmath29 will become true , @xmath28 being true until then .",
    "( see the semantics below for a precise definition . )    for example , the statement @xmath58}$ ] means : with probability at least @xmath52 , starting from the state @xmath5 , within @xmath59 steps @xmath29 will become true , and until then @xmath28 will remain true . in a sense ,",
    "the formula @xmath60}$ ] itself denotes the set of all states @xmath61 such that , starting from @xmath61 , with probability at least @xmath52 , etc .",
    "the above statement is of course equivalent to @xmath0 being a member of such a set .",
    "the two `` until '' operators allow us to define other operators which are standard in any temporal logic .",
    "for example , given a state formula @xmath28 , the path formula @xmath62 , which means that _ eventually , within @xmath57 steps , @xmath28 will happen _ , can be defined as @xmath63 , and the path formula @xmath64 , which means that _ eventually , at some time , @xmath28 will happen _ , can be defined as @xmath65 .",
    "formulas containing the standard `` always '' operator @xmath66 can also be defined , although not in the straightforward way one may expect at first sight : @xmath67 is not a correct definition , since pctl does not allow for the negation of path formulas .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath68 denote an atomic proposition , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote two _ state _ formulas , and @xmath32 denote a _ path _ formula .",
    "the semantics of pctl is defined as follows : @xmath69 } }    & \\quad { { \\leftrightarrow}}\\quad   { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb p}}_{x}\\left ( \\{{\\phi}\\ } \\right ) \\sim p \\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] with loose notation , @xmath70 stands for the set of all the paths @xmath71 that satisfy a given path formula @xmath32 . here is the related semantics : @xmath72 due to the latter definitions , if @xmath32 is a path formula then @xmath73 is always an _ event _ , that is , it always belongs to @xmath14 .",
    "the great relevance of pctl for finite markov chains lies , above all , in the fact that the validity of arbitrarily complex formulas at a given state can be decided exactly and in finite time .",
    "in particular , dealing with the common operators @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 etc .",
    "requires just the parsing of a tree of sub - formulas ; a `` bounded until '' formula can be decided recursively ; and an `` unbounded until '' formula requires the solution of a system of linear equations .",
    "for these matters the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite . we shall not delve into details here , because the relatively easy methods available for finite markov chains can not be easily extended to the case of noncountable - space markov processes , with respect to which the decision of pctl formulas will be a matter of computing integrals recursively , or solving integral equations .",
    "in what follows we define pctl grammar and semantics on a noncountable space @xmath77 in terms of a stochastic kernel @xmath78 and a probability measure @xmath79 defined on the space of trajectories of the process .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite for an abstract extension of pctl to general markov chains .    given a nonempty borel set @xmath77 ( i.e. , a borel subset of a polish space ) ,",
    "its borel @xmath13-algebra is denoted by @xmath80 . by convention , when referring to sets or functions , `` measurable '' means `` borel - measurable . ''",
    "if @xmath77 is a nonempty borel space , a _ stochastic kernel _ on @xmath77 is a map @xmath81 $ ] such that @xmath82 is a probability measure on @xmath77 for each fixed @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is a measurable function on @xmath77 for each fixed @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a nonempty borel set , and let @xmath86 be a stochastic kernel on @xmath4 .",
    "for each @xmath87 we define the space @xmath88 of _ admissible histories _ up to time @xmath89 as @xmath90 .",
    "a generic element @xmath91 of @xmath88 , called an admissible @xmath89-history is a vector of the form @xmath92 , with @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "hereafter we let the @xmath13-algebra generated by the history @xmath91 be denoted by @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "suppose the initial state @xmath0 is given , and let @xmath97 denote the dirac measure at @xmath98 .",
    "we consider the canonical sample space @xmath11 and the product @xmath13-algebra @xmath14 on @xmath15 . by a standard result of ionescu - tulcea  (",
    "* chapter  4 , ",
    "3 , theorem  5 ) there exists a unique probability measure , denoted by @xmath18 on the measurable space @xmath17 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "the `` labelling '' function @xmath102 is introduced in @xcite and @xcite as a means to specify which states satisfy which atomic propositions . in other words , it is just a particular way to look at the _ relation _ `` @xmath0 satisfies @xmath68 ''",
    ". it should be clear that an equally legitimate way to accomplish the same is to substitute from the beginning the `` labelling '' function @xmath103 with a function @xmath104 , that assigns to each atomic proposition @xmath68 the set @xmath105 of all those states that satisfy @xmath68 .",
    "the semantics can be redefined accordingly in a straightforward way : @xmath106 but since there is no substantial difference between saying that a state @xmath0 satisfies a given property , and stating that @xmath0 belongs to a set , namely the set of all the states that satisfy that property , it is easily seen that proceeding along this way one may drop _ tout - court _ the distinction between formulas and sets of states satisfying them . in the following , we shall follow this idea consistently ( mainly for ease of notation ) .",
    "thus , from now on , we shall assume that the properties expressed by formulas are actually encoded by _",
    "measurable _ sets @xmath107 , we will use the letters @xmath108 for both the formulas ( or atomic propositions ) and the sets that encode them , and we will use the notations @xmath109 and @xmath110 somewhat interchangeably . in the same fashion , we will drop the distinction between _ path _ formulas and _ events _ in the process s probability space .    let us denote the family of atomic propositions with a family of borel measurable sets @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
