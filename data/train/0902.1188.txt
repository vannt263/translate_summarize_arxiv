    "recent surveys have challenged the traditional view that merging between dark matter halos governs the mass assembly history and evolution of the galaxies hosted by these halos .",
    "the surprising abundance of established massive galaxies at @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been followed by increasing evidence for an early completion of star formation in the most massive galaxies , followed by continued activity in lower - mass systems  a phenomenon now termed `` downsizing '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these observations reveal top - down evolutionary patterns that stand in contrast to the expected hierarchical , or bottom - up , nature of cdm halo assembly .",
    "while semi - analytic models employing various energy feedback prescriptions have moved closer to reproducing top - down behavior within the hierarchical framework @xcite , it has not been observationally possible to verify the cdm prediction that via merging , more massive galaxies are assembled at later times . in principle",
    ", the signal is encoded in the evolving stellar mass function ( mf ) which would be expected to show a rising number density at the high - mass end as a function of cosmic time .",
    "current surveys , however , are too much affected by cosmic variance ( or , more accurately , sample variance ) uncertainties to confirm this trend ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is also difficult to separate evolution in the mf resulting from galaxy mergers from that associated with star formation ( sf ) @xcite . the clear alternative is to study galaxy mergers directly and to quantify their role in driving mass assembly by determining how the galaxy merger rate depends on mass .",
    "in addition to driving mass assembly , major mergers ( defined here to be those involving components with a mass ratio greater than @xmath14 ) have also been proposed as the key mechanism that transforms disk - like galaxies into spheroidals @xcite .",
    "it may also shut off star formation via triggered agn feedback ( see * ? ? ?",
    "mergers may not only move galaxies onto the `` red sequence , '' but so - called `` dry mergers '' between red - sequence systems have been invoked to explain the increasing contribution at @xmath15m@xmath6  to the global stellar mass density from red galaxies .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the fundamental question is whether the _ major _ merger rate is high enough to explain the mass - dependent increase in the numbers of spheroidal and red - sequence galaxies or whether other mechanisms for building spheroidal systems are needed .",
    "@xcite appealed to numerical simulations to argue that the predicted major merger rate among dark matter halos is too low .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached by @xcite .",
    "it is now imperative to compare the formation rate of spheroidals to observations capable of identifying major mergers and resolving their frequency as a function of mass .",
    "previous observational attempts to measure the galaxy merger rate since @xmath10 have faced a number of challenges and sometimes disagree in their conclusions .",
    "the derived rate depends on the assumed efficiency and merger timescale , but more importantly , merger definitions vary among authors . additionally , it has been difficult to distinguish major from minor mergers . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the merger rate has been estimated based on the occurrence of morphologically disturbed systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the frequency of optical pairs , either defined with respect to their relative velocity difference ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "parameterizing the redshift dependence as @xmath17 , the range of reported values is virtually unconstrained , with @xmath184 .",
    "part of the problem may be the use of optical samples which we argued in previous work based on a near - ir sample @xcite , may be biased by triggered sf ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "although great care is needed in making comparisons with these methods , each of which defines a `` merger '' in a different way , it is now clear that there is considerable uncertainty in the literature regarding both the rate of merging and whether it rises substantially with redshift .",
    "our goal in this paper is to overcome some of the problems faced in previous work by using a mass - limited sample of galaxy pairs drawn from the great observatories origins deep survey fields ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . our @xmath19-selected sample is more than 15 times larger than that discussed in @xcite .",
    "the enlarged sample allows us to identify pairs using the physically motivated definition of a major merger  as determined by the inferred mass ratio  and therefore enables us to measure the impact of mergers on mass assembly and make direct comparisons to evolutionary trends such as the formation rate of spheroidal galaxies . with our large sample size",
    ", we can study the merger rate as a function of mass , a key tool for testing the late assembly times predicted for massive galaxies .",

    "deblending is an obvious concern in close pair studies .",
    "we inspected many deblended sources , comparing them to their counterparts in the hst @xmath30-band imaging , and verified that the deblending algorithm successfully identifies what appears to be separate galaxies and not sub - components of individual systems .",

    "we use these high - quality photo-@xmath30s  whenever possible in goods - s , but still require an additional 1440 photo-@xmath30s  to provide redshifts for full goods - s catalog .",

    ", we find an outlier fraction of the bpz photo-@xmath30s  of @xmath210% and @xmath51 with outliers excluded .",
    "this poorer performance of bpz in goods - s compared to goods - n  despite the addition of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands  seems to result from the shallower @xmath41-band photometry in goods - s as well as a discrepancy in the isaac filter curves ) do not match the latest calibrations in the final version 2.0 release .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that judgments on the quality of photo-@xmath30  estimates from any survey are limited by the nature of the spectroscopic comparison set that is available .",
    "the deep @xmath19-selected catalogs described above provide a powerful dataset for our galaxy pair analysis . before describing the mass - limited sample we draw from this dataset and the methodology we use to study pairs , we present our techniques for estimating three key physical galaxy properties that allow us to characterize the role of merging among different galaxy types .",
    "the first of these properties is the stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) , which is estimated using the bayesian code described in @xcite .",
    "sed fitting is performed using the 2  diameter @xmath55 photometry and the best available redshift .",
    "the observed sed of each galaxy is compared to a grid of 13440 models from the @xcite population synthesis code that span a range of metallicities , star formation histories ( parametrized as exponentials ) , ages , and dust content .",
    "no bursts are included in our models and only those models with ages ( roughly ) less than the cosmic age at each redshift are considered .",
    "we use a chabrier imf @xcite and assume a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 .    at each grid point , the @xmath19-band  @xmath56 ratios , inferred @xmath0 , and probability that the model matches the observed sed is stored .",
    "this probability is marginalized over the grid , giving the stellar mass probability distribution , the median of which is taken as the final estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "the width of the distribution provides the uncertainty which is typically 0.10.2 dex .",
    "this is added in quadrature to the @xmath19-band  magnitude uncertainty to determine the final error on @xmath0 .",
    "stellar mass estimates for galaxies with photo-@xmath30s  also suffer from the uncertainty in luminosity distance introduced by the photo-@xmath30  error and the possibility of catastrophically wrong redshift information @xcite .",
    "we will take both into account in the analysis that follows .",
    "more broadly , any stellar mass estimate suffers potential systematic errors from uncertainties inherent in stellar population modeling and various required assumptions , such as the form of the imf .",
    "several papers have stressed the importance of treating thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars ( tp - agbs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) an element that is missing in the @xcite models .",
    "the recent and thorough investigation of population synthesis modeling by @xcite , however , argues that @xmath57 ratios estimated from @xcite are largely resistant to the uncertain contribution from tp - agbs as well as other limitations of current models .",
    "still , it is important to recognize that @xmath0 estimates may be affected by unrecognized systematic uncertainties at the 0.10.2 dex level .",
    "we use the inferred rest - frame color to roughly split our sample into blue , star - forming galaxies and red , quiescent ones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we use the acs rest - frame @xmath58 color , with @xmath59-corrections determined from the sed fit performed by our stellar mass estimator . for each galaxy ,",
    "the color of every model galaxy in the grid is weighted by the probability that the model matches the observed sed .",
    "the weighted colors are then summed over the grid to derive the probability distribution as a function of @xmath60 color . as with @xmath0",
    "we take the median of the distribution as the final color estimate .",
    "the @xmath60 distribution across the sample is bimodal , as expected .",
    "we define red galaxies to be those redder than @xmath61 ( ab units ) in this filter system .",
    "this threshold results in very similar red / blue distributions and number densities as those reported in @xcite and @xcite using data from the deep2 redshift survey .",
    "we note however that while a restframe color partition is easy to implement , it is still a blunt method for discriminating star - forming from passive galaxies .",
    "for example , contamination from dusty star - forming galaxies on the red sequence is at least @xmath210% ( see * ? ? ? * ) and a comparison to morphological types ( see below ) for a subset of galaxies with @xmath62 and @xmath63 shows that @xmath212% of blue galaxies are classified as spheroidal while @xmath224% of red galaxies are classified as disk - like .",
    "galaxy morphology is the final property we consider and is important because morphological evolution may be driven in part by merging .",
    "morphological classification in the goods fields was presented in @xcite and is publicly available .",
    "the classification was carried out visually to a magnitude limit of @xmath64 which increases the effective mass limit of subsamples split by morphology , as we discuss below .",
    "each source was assigned one of the following morphological types : -2=star , -1=compact , 0=e , 1=e / s0 , 2=s0 , 3=sab , 4=s , 5=scd , 6=irr , 7=unclass , 8=merger , 9=fault . as in @xcite , we group these definitions into the broader categories of spheroidals ( types 02 ) , disks ( types 35 ) , and irregulars ( types 68 ) . visual morphologies are available for 1369 sources in goods - n and 1200 in goods - s .",
    "in any study of galaxy mergers , it is important to distinguish major from minor mergers , since major mergers  typically defined to have mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:1have the potential to radically affect its morphology and star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . with many previous studies lacking near - ir data , however , pair samples comprised an unknown mix of mass ratios .",
    "in fact , pairs defined using an optical magnitude difference may lead to inflated pair counts from triggered sf @xcite , an effect that may worsen at higher redshifts where the global sfr increases .",
    "thus an important goal of this work is to use our @xmath19-selected sample to select only those pairs with stellar mass ratios consistent with major mergers .",
    "we implement this requirement by selecting pairs with a magnitude difference , our decision to use the _ observed _ magnitude difference as opposed to the _ inferred _ mass difference is designed to facilitate future comparisons to our results .",
    "] of @xmath65 . using pairs where mass estimates are available for both members , we find that this magnitude criterion results in mass ratios @xmath66 for @xmath280% of the pairs .",
    "this number is greater than @xmath67 for 90% .",
    "pairs are only included if found within a projected annulus of @xmath68 determined by the redshift of the primary or `` host '' galaxy , given our assumed cosmology ( @xmath20=70 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23=0.3 and @xmath24=0.7 ) .",
    "we avoid double counting by identifying only those companions that are fainter than their host galaxy . in order to infer the true physical pair fraction",
    ", we use two methods to remove chance projections from the raw pair counts defined above .",
    "the first uses a correction based solely on the sky density of background sources while the second employs redshift information to identify pairs in 3d space .    before describing these methods in detail , we begin with a description of our mass - limited sample of host galaxies .",
    "it is important that the sample be clearly defined because the definition of the pair fraction , @xmath69 , is determined with respect to such a sample . with our definition ,",
    "the number of paired systems is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of host galaxies .",
    "note that this definition differs from that of other authors in that @xmath69  is not the fraction of galaxies located in pairs ( often termed @xmath72 ) but instead reflects the potential number of mergers within a sample ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "finally , because our sample allows us to determine not only the fraction , but the comoving number density of close pairs , we also describe our technique for estimating that quantity in this section . converting the observed pair fractions into merger rates",
    "requires additional and uncertain assumptions , and we save this topic for   [ discussion ] .",
    "one of the primary advantages of our dataset is that both host and companion galaxies are drawn from a well - understood , @xmath19-selected catalog that can be characterized in terms of mass completeness .",
    "based on the different depths of our near - ir images , we optimize our sample by choosing a @xmath19-band  magnitude limit of @xmath74 .",
    "all companions and host galaxies must be brighter than this limit . because companions are defined to be no more than 1.5 magnitudes fainter in the @xmath19-band  than their corresponding host galaxy , this effectively means that our host sample is limited to @xmath75 .    throughout this paper",
    "we will adopt three redshift intervals : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . given the @xmath19-band  limit imposed ,",

    "this increases the mass completeness limits of host galaxies to @xmath79 10.3 , 10.6 , and 11.2 . below these values",
    ", some hosts may not be included in the sample .",

    "these stellar mass limits are estimated by considering the detection efficiency of redshifted sed templates of burst - like stellar populations with a formation redshift of @xmath81 .",
    "because of their high @xmath82 ratios , these models provide conservative and accurate mass limit estimates .",
    "since companions are defined by being near their host galaxy , the field geometry of the sample is also important .",
    "we define contiguous survey regions within both goods fields where the @xmath19-band  detection limit is greater than 23.57 and the acs tiles maximally overlap ( we exclude the triangular , low - s / n perimeters of the goods footprint ) .",
    "all of the isaac images in goods - s meet this requirement , giving a search area of 147 arcmin@xmath33 .",
    "we exclude three of the 16 moircs images in goods - n because they are shallower than @xmath74 .",
    "this gives a final area of 139 arcmin@xmath33 in the northern field , or 286 arcmin@xmath33 with both fields combined .",
    "only host galaxies separated by a distance greater than @xmath83 from the border of the defined region are included ( this removes @xmath23% from the sample ) .",
    "stars , as determined visually in the morphology catalog of @xcite and also as identified spectroscopically , are removed .",
    "the final host sample includes 2994 primary galaxies , more than 60% of which have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , spectroscopic redshifts are not always available for both the host galaxy and potential companions .",
    "we must therefore make statistical corrections that account for the contamination of the true _ physical _ pair fraction from close , line - of - sight projections .",
    "we describe the two approaches we adopt for this correction below .",
    "our first method for correcting the raw pair counts is common in past studies at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we require only that potential companions be detected in the @xmath19-band  and that they satisfy the criteria described above .",
    "the field contamination for each host galaxy is measured according to the @xmath19-band  source density ( i.e. , number counts ) observed in the defined survey region in the magnitude interval @xmath84 , with @xmath85 . because of cosmic variance , it is important to make this measurement separately for the host sample in goods - n and goods - s . for a given host galaxy , the measured sky density of possible contaminants",
    "is multiplied by the area of the corresponding search annulus to determine the contamination rate per galaxy .",
    "this is then summed across the potential host sample to estimate the total number of field contaminants , @xmath86 .",
    "we estimate the number of true physical pairs by subtracting @xmath86 from the total number of potential companions fulfilling the search criteria described above . as discussed in detail in  [ results ] , this method identifies 242 pairs within our sample , @xmath2160 of which are expected to by chance projections .",
    "uncertainties are determined by adding the poisson error from @xmath87 and from the total raw pair counts in quadrature .",
    "we expect an additional contribution from cosmic variance in the relatively small goods fields .",
    "the vast majority of faint companions identified in the @xmath19-band  catalog are also detected in the acs and ground - based optical imaging which means that photometric redshifts can be estimated for these sources .",
    "a sizable fraction of companions ( @xmath230% ) also have spectroscopic redshifts . in our second pair",
    "counting method , we use the redshift information available for faint near - by neighbors to find those that are likely to be physically associated with their brighter host .",
    "this amounts to an additional redshift constraint on the identification of companions .",
    "for both the potential hosts and companions we define a redshift uncertainty of @xmath88 for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , @xmath89 for galaxies with photometric redshifts is somewhat arbitrary and represents a compromise between the bpz photo-@xmath30 uncertainty ( @xmath20.1 ) and the music photo-@xmath30  uncertainty ( @xmath20.03 ) . ] , and an unbounded @xmath90 for the remaining few galaxies without optical detections and therefore with no redshift information .",

    ", some of the host - companion pairs defined by photometric redshifts will be close in projection but not physically associated . as in our first pair counting method , a contamination correction is needed although it will of course be smaller since most contaminants are already excluded by their discrepant redshifts . as in @xcite , we determine this correction factor by randomizing the coordinate positions of all the sources in our catalog ( but retaining all redshift and magnitude information ) .",
    "any companions identified in the randomized data are clearly chance superpositions .",
    "thus , by repeating this exercise for 100 randomized datasets , we can estimate the average contamination rate , its uncertainty , and the dependence of these quantities on @xmath0 and pair type ( see below ) .",
    "note that in the limit that no redshift information is available for faint neighbors this approach is equivalent to the first method described above .",
    "however , for surveys that contain dense environments like galaxy clusters ( goods is too small to sample such environments ) , this technique underestimates the needed correction because it does not account for the increased rate of chance projections in dense regions .",
    "finally , we note that the possibility of catastrophic errors in photo-@xmath30estimates will cause some true physical companions to be disregarded as chance projections .",
    "we can determine the importance of this effect by examining the quality of our various photo-@xmath30  estimates (  [ redshifts ] ) and estimating the likely number of catastrophic photo-@xmath30  failures that cause us to underestimate the true number of pairs in method ii .",
    "based on this analysis we correct all @xmath69values derived from method ii upwards by 1% .",
    "using method ii , we find 89 pairs , @xmath2 41 of which are expected to be chance projections .",
    "one of the important quantities we wish to determine in this work is the comoving volumetric merger rate as a function of the stellar mass of the host galaxy . as we discuss in ",
    "[ discussion ] , this `` merger rate mass function '' provides a powerful tool for understanding the role of galaxy mergers in driving mass assembly as well as evolution in the numbers of different populations such as ellipticals and red - sequence galaxies .",
    "we estimate such mass functions using the simple @xmath92 technique @xcite .",
    "we weight host galaxies and associated pairs by the maximum volume in which they would be detected within the @xmath19-band  limit in a given redshift interval . in practice ,",
    "our magnitude limits impose restrictions only in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath78 ) . for each host galaxy @xmath93 in the redshift interval @xmath94 ,",
    "the value of @xmath95 is given by the minimum redshift at which the galaxy would drop out of the sample ,    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the solid angle subtended by the survey area , and @xmath98 is the comoving volume element .",
    "the redshift limits are given as ,    @xmath99    @xmath100    where the redshift interval , @xmath94 , is defined by @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 refers to the redshift at which the galaxy would still be detected below the @xmath19-band  limit for that particular redshift interval .",
    "we use the best - fit sed template as determined by the stellar mass estimator to calculate @xmath102 , thereby accounting for the @xmath59-corrections necessary to compute @xmath92 values ( no evolutionary correction is applied ) .",
    "as discussed in   [ intro ] , the hierarchical framework that underlies current galaxy formation models argues that the mass scale on which galaxies assemble increases with time .",
    "observations of star formation quenching and morphological evolution show that these processes are set by a mass scale that decreases with time ( downsizing ) .",
    "meanwhile , galaxy mergers are thought to be key drivers of both hierarchical assembly and the evolution of sf and galaxy morphology .",
    "so , understanding the mass dependence of merging provides a critical test of the role mergers play in galaxy mass assembly and evolution .",
    "we begin our investigation of how galaxy mergers depend on mass by presenting the pair fraction measured using the two methods described in the previous section .",
    "with method i , in which no redshift information for companion galaxies is used , 242 pairs are found , @xmath2160 of which are expected to be chance projections .",
    "the method i pair fractions , partitioned by mass and redshift , are plotted in the top panel of figure [ fig : frac_mass ] . with method ii , which takes companion redshifts into account , 89 pairs are found , @xmath241 of which are expected projections . the resulting method ii pair fractions are plotted in the bottom panel of [ fig : frac_mass ] . in both cases ,",
    "pair fractions are plotted for three redshift intervals : @xmath103 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the full sample ( x symbols ) as well as the dependence on the mass of the host , as indicated by the differently sized circular symbols , is shown .",
    "all of the plotted points are complete in terms of stellar mass except for the highest redshift @xmath104m@xmath6@xmath105 bin which is @xmath280% complete as a result of the @xmath19-band  limit .",
    "the results from both methods are listed in table [ table : fpair ] .",
    "we first note that the two panels in figure [ fig : frac_mass ] are similar , reinforcing the utility of the two methods .",
    "both plots show that roughly 25% of galaxies in a mass - limited sample host fainter companions .",
    "the value of @xmath69depends on the maximum allowed pair separation , @xmath83 .",
    "the average value of @xmath69  increases by an amount of 0.03 for @xmath106 compared to @xmath107 .",
    "this difference does not impact the derived merger rate because the expected merger efficiency decreases with larger @xmath83 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use @xmath108 in what follows .    the key result in figure [ fig : frac_mass ]",
    "is the increase in @xmath69among more massive host galaxies .",
    "hints of this trend were observed by @xcite in their @xmath109-selected study of close pairs at @xmath110 .",
    "we confirm it here with moderate significance to @xmath111 using both pair count correction methods .",
    "we verified that these results are still apparent for different values of @xmath112 including @xmath113kpc and @xmath114kpc .",
    "the mass dependence is also apparent in each goods field separately , suggesting that this trend is not a result of cosmic variance .    as we discuss in ",
    "[ discussion ] , some of the increase at higher masses may reflect the stronger clustering of such galaxies . in that section",
    ", we return to the important question regarding the extent to which the mass dependence observed for the pair fraction translates into a mass dependence for the merger rate .",
    "still , the fact that the lowest mass bins in figure [ fig : frac_mass ] are nearly consistent with a zero pair fraction implies that the merger rate inferred from this and other studies is dominated by higher mass galaxies .",
    "we show in  [ vol_merge ] that this leads to the result that major mergers are unlikely to be the sole mechanism behind the formation of spheroidal galaxies and the red sequence . at the same time",
    ", the higher merger rates implied for massive galaxies shows that they are continuing to assemble after @xmath10 .",
    "this is an important piece of direct evidence for hierarchical growth which we seek to quantify in  [ vol_merge ] .    finally , we comment on the possibility that @xmath69  evolves with redshift .",
    "averaging over the full mass range , @xmath115 , we find no statistically significant evolution . with @xmath116 , we measure @xmath117 using method i and @xmath118 using method ii .",
    "in addition to their role in mass assembly and their potential to affect the morphology and sfr of galaxies , mergers have also been invoked as a means to build the massive end of the red sequence .",
    "successive dry mergers between early - type galaxies at lower masses can increase the numbers at higher masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this scenario , mergers must clearly be common within the red - sequence .",
    "we can begin to test this by characterizing the dependence of @xmath69  on host galaxy type .",
    "our goal is not only to count the frequency of dry mergers , but also the remaining fraction of wet mergers since only these events can be responsible for morphological transformation or star formation quenching .",
    "both pair counting methods offer insight on the question of how the pair fraction varies with galaxy type .",
    "since the first method relies on an entirely statistical field correction , we can only use it to study trends with host galaxy type .",
    "the properties of the companion and host together  the wet and dry merger frequency , for example  are accessible with method ii and discussed below .",
    "method i allows us to divide the host sample by both mass and type .",
    "figure [ fig : pair_frac_col ] shows the result when host galaxy type is defined using the color bimodality to separate star - forming from passive systems ( also see table [ table : fpair ] ) .",
    "bins corresponding to the most massive blue galaxies have not been plotted because they contain fewer than 10 hosts .    while the uncertainties have increased compared to figure [ fig : frac_mass ] ,",
    "there is weak evidence that the mass - dependent trend observed in figure [ fig : frac_mass ] is reflected in the star - forming properties of the host galaxies , with higher pair fractions found for quenched , red hosts , in large part because such galaxies dominate at the highest masses .",
    "this suggests a role for dry mergers in building the most massive early - type galaxies .",
    "however , a second interpretation discussed further in   [ discussion ] is that figure [ fig : pair_frac_col ] may reveal the greater degree of clustering among massive red galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that the number of red hosts with companions in the lowest mass bin is consistent with zero .",
    "if confirmed with future studies , this observation would indicate that major mergers among red systems with @xmath119m@xmath6  can not contribute significantly to the increasing abundance of red sequence galaxies at higher masses . transforming blue galaxies into red objects via quenched star formation",
    "would therefore appear to be a more important mechanism for red sequence growth at @xmath120m@xmath6 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pair_frac_morph ] we explore the relationship between pair fraction and galaxy morphology . here",
    "the host sample has been restricted to @xmath80 which makes some mass bins incomplete ( although we note we are measuring fractions not absolute quantities ) .",
    "bins that are less than @xmath280% complete incomplete are indicated by lighter colors and open symbols and will tend to have an artificially lower number of redder galaxies . given the large error bars",
    ", any trends observed here will require confirmation from larger studies .",
    "still , there is a hint that spheroidals and irregulars host more companions than disk galaxies .",
    "spheroidals , which are expected to be mostly red and quiescent , also tend to exhibit higher pair fractions among high - mass galaxies with @xmath121m@xmath6@xmath122 ( although this is not the case at @xmath9 ) .",
    "one intriguing and more robust result of figure [ fig : pair_frac_morph ] is the appearance of a high fraction of irregular hosts at intermediate masses . in some ways ,",
    "this is unexpected because irregulars represent only 1020% of the galaxy population in our redshift range with @xmath123",
    "they should therefore be less likely to host companions , if pairs were randomly distributed among all galaxy types .",
    "even in incomplete bins which are biased against red spheroidals , host galaxies are more likely to have irregular morphologies than disk - like ones . because we ignore companions with @xmath124kpc , the prevalence of irregular hosts tentatively suggests that even more distant companions can imprint significant morphological disturbances on their host galaxy , perhaps after executing a first pass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite using sdss .",
    "they also find an enhancement of sf among close pairs which could lead to morphological peculiarities .",
    "it stands to reason that not all irregular systems are in the last stages of a significant merger , which may in part explain why merger rates based on disturbed morphologies are typically higher than those inferred from pair counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taken together , the type dependent pair fractions we have presented suggest that galaxies with higher masses , redder colors , and early - type morphologies tend to host companions more frequently than their lower mass , star - forming , and disk - like counterparts .",
    "this lends support to the concept of dry mergers as a mechanism for red sequence growth , especially at the highest masses , a point we return to in  [ mass_assembly ] .",
    "however , dry mergers do not appear to be important for building the red sequence at @xmath7m@xmath6  because the number of red hosts at these masses is nearly zero . at the same time , the enhanced pair fraction for more massive red and spheroidal galaxies may simply reflect the denser environments of these galaxies . the question of whether the derived merger rates are also enhanced in such environments is discussed in   [ discussion ] .      in the top panel of figure [ fig : zpp ]",
    "we use method ii combined with the rest - frame color of pair members to distinguish the fraction of pairs expected to result in dry and wet mergers ( also see table [ table : dry_wet ] ) .",
    "red - red pairs are identified as dry merger candidates .",
    "blue - blue and mixed pairs indicate the presence of cold gas reservoirs and therefore represent potential wet mergers . for the few secondary ( companion )",
    "galaxies without a redshift , the pair type can not be determined and is labeled as `` n / a . ''",
    "note that a statistical correction as described in   [ methodii ] has been subtracted from each category so that negative values are possible in some cases .",
    "an interesting evolutionary signal appears in figure [ fig : zpp ] .",
    "first , it appears that dry , red - red pairs are less frequent than their wet counterparts ( the sum of blue - blue and mixed ) in the highest redshift bin but become increasingly important with cosmic time , eventually dominating the low redshift bin . at the same time",
    "the number of blue - blue pairs decreases to zero .",
    "these trends are significant at the 1-@xmath29 level and may simply reflect the changing nature of the galaxy population with masses @xmath125 which is increasingly dominated by red galaxies at late times . if our sample size allowed us to consider only high mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath126 ) we might expect dry pairs among such galaxies to show an even earlier increase since this population evolves into quenched red galaxies first @xcite . however , it is important to emphasize that the dry pair fraction is consistent with what is expected given the makeup of galaxies from which the pairs are drawn .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite who studied the fractions of blue - blue , red - red , and mixed systems among kinematic pairs identified in the deep2 survey .",
    "they also found a higher number of blue - blue pairs at @xmath10 compared to the present day combined with an increasing number of red - red and , to a lesser extent , mixed systems .",
    "while that work benefits from spectroscopic redshifts for all pair members , our analysis has the advantage of being mass - limited and capable of selecting only major pairs .",
    "furthermore , it does not require weighting to account for biases in the spectroscopic target selection . given these very different but complementary methods , it is encouraging to see agreement both in the derived type - dependent pair fraction ( note the different definitions of pair fraction : @xmath127 ) and its evolution with redshift .",
    "our data also allow us to examine the frequency of pairs defined by the morphological type of both members .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : zpp ] where it is important to remember that in the highest redshift bin , 30 - 40% of red galaxies with @xmath128 will be missed because of the @xmath129 morphology cut . in this panel",
    "we label disk - like and irregular galaxies as `` late - type '' and spheroidals as `` early - type . ''",
    "we see no statistically significant trends , although there is a hint that late - late pairs are on par with early - early and mixed pairs in the highest redshift bin , but become subdominant in the mid- and low - z bins .",
    "although larger datasets will be needed to confirm this , such an effect would be expected as the fraction of late - type galaxies declines with time .",
    "as we discuss further in   [ discussion ] , figure [ fig : zpp ] has important implications on the role of wet mergers in transforming blue ( disk ) galaxies into red ( spheroidal ) galaxies .",
    "both indicate that the implied number of such wet mergers is a factor of @xmath22 less than the total merger rate .",
    "these figures also show that the rate of dry merging is not enhanced beyond what is expected given the makeup of galaxies in a mass - limited sample . in   [ discussion ] we show explicitly that neither morphological transformations occurring after wet mergers nor mass buildup caused by dry mergers appears sufficient to explain the increasing number of intermediate to very massive early - type galaxies .",

    "qualitatively , our observations of an increase in the merger fraction with mass echo the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos as determined with @xmath211cdm n - body simulations . in an analysis of the millennium simulation , @xcite , for example ,",

    "this mass dependence is significantly weaker but in the same sense as the factor of @xmath22 increase with mass we observe in the galaxy merger fraction among the @xmath214 galaxies thought to populate such halos .",
    "the enhanced mass dependence in the galaxy merger rate may be due to the way halos are occupied ( details forthcoming in hopkins et al .",

    "this means that minor halo mergers can contribute to _ major _ galaxy mergers since less massive halos , being closer to the @xmath215 peak , have larger @xmath0 fractions .",
    "because there are always more minor than major halo mergers , this enhances the observed fraction of major galaxy mergers at higher masses .",
    "if our observations could probe below the peak , this interpretation would predict a suppressed galaxy major merger rate relative to the halo major merger rate since here some fraction of major halo mergers would host galaxies with a minor mass ratio .",
    "indeed , this qualitative picture is borne out in detail by @xcite . as discussed above ,",
    "the galaxy major merger rate predicted from their model based on n - body simulations is in remarkable agreement with our observations ( see figure [ fig : vol_merge ] ) .      another important insight gained from figure",
    "[ fig : vol_merge ] is the role of mergers in the formation of elliptical and red sequence galaxies .",
    "the red asterisks in this plot show the formation rate ( the rate at which the abundance increases ) of visually classified spheroidal systems , as determined from the sample of @xcite .",
    "error bars are poissonian and do not include cosmic variance which we estimate enters at the @xmath20.2 dex level ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the light blue points show the merger rate mass function after the approximate fraction of dry spheroidal - spheroidal mergers ( as measured in   [ dry_wet_pairs ] ) is subtracted .",
    "this result was anticipated by an analysis of the expected number of major halo mergers as measured in the millennium simulation which is also unable to account for the rate at which new spheroidals appear @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to the inability of major mergers to account for the formation of red sequence galaxies which increase at a similar rate as the spheroidal population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancy between major ( wet ) mergers and the formation of spheroidals shown in figure [ fig : vol_merge ] ranges from factors of @xmath21712 .",
    "simply interpreted , this requires mechanisms in addition to merging to make spheroids .",
    "how strong is this requirement ?",
    "one concern is cosmic variance which could affect both the merger and spheroidal formation rates  we estimate the discrepancy could be overestimated by no more than a factor of @xmath22 as a result @xcite . at the same time , the gap could be closed to some extent if the merger timescale were less than @xmath390.5 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , a comparison of various theoretical treatments concludes that current predictions for @xmath152  are again uncertain at the factor of @xmath22 level ( hopkins et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "furthermore , our spheroidal classification , while dominated by ellipticals , includes s0 s and some sa galaxies is the reason we group them into a single `` spheroidal '' category @xcite . ] .",
    "the large bulges in such galaxies could be built in mergers with mass ratios less than 1:4 , increasing the number of relevant mergers by @xmath218% .",
    "finally , multiple minor mergers can also drive morphological evolution .",
    "we would expect a factor of @xmath22 times more 1:10 minor mergers than the number of observed 1:4 mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath23 such minor mergers have the equivalent morphological impact as one 1:4 merger @xcite , minor mergers can account for an additional @xmath219% of the morphological transformations needed to form spheroidals .",
    "assuming these potential systematic effects conspire in the same way and including minor mergers , it would be possible to reduce the discrepancy by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "this would lend stronger support to the merger hypothesis and motivate a more precise treatment , but would still leave some tension at @xmath208 .",
    "for this reason and given the current observations and most recent theoretical assumptions , we conclude that other mechanisms in addition to merging may be needed to explain the transformation of disk - like galaxies into spheroidals ( see * ? ? ? * ) and the quenching of star formation .",
    "using a deep @xmath19-selected catalog comprised of data from the goods fields , we have presented an analysis of the close pair fraction and implied merger rate of galaxies drawn from a mass - limited sample over the redshift range @xmath150 . using two methods of estimation , we find a relatively low pair fraction of @xmath24% with a redshift dependence of @xmath220 .",
    "our analysis strongly supports the basic conclusion of a low merger rate since @xmath10 , as deduced by several other recent surveys .",
    "our key observational finding is that the pair fraction of galaxies with @xmath5m@xmath6  is higher ( @xmath2219% ) than the corresponding pair fraction of lower mass systems ( @xmath2224% for @xmath7m@xmath6 ) .",
    "in addition , red systems and galaxies with spheroidal morphologies appear more likely to have companions than their blue or disk - like counterparts .",
    "this is in line with extrapolations of the correlation function to small scales .",
    "we find that the fraction of host galaxies classified as irregular ( often more than half of hosts with @xmath223 ) is larger than the fraction of irregulars in the parent population ( typically 1020% ) .",
    "this supports the notion that orbiting companions can distort the primary galaxy even before a merger has occurred .",
    "dry mergers are only significant at the highest masses in our sample , @xmath5m@xmath6 , but this appears to result from the fact that most galaxies in this mass range have already become red , early - type systems by @xmath10 . at lower masses ( @xmath7m@xmath6 ) the fraction of red galaxies that host companions is consistent with zero , and we thus conclude that dry mergers alone are incapable of fully explaining the build - up of the red sequence , especially at @xmath224@xmath225m@xmath6  where the formation of red galaxies is particularly rapid . in support of this conclusion , we also find that the number of dry pairs accounts for @xmath250% of all pairs in our mass range and evolves in way that is consistent with pairs drawn randomly from the parent population .",
    "the emerging picture is one in which dry mergers are not the main driver for red sequence growth but instead become increasingly common as a result of it .    by adopting estimates for the close pair merger efficiency and timescale ,",
    "we determine the mass - dependent volumetric merger rate . from a comparison to the formation rate of galaxies with spheroidal morphology at the same redshifts , we conclude that the major merger rate is too low to fully explain the formation of spheroidal ( and red sequence ) galaxies since @xmath10 .    in terms of mass assembly ,",
    "major mergers have a strong impact on galaxies with @xmath5m@xmath6 , @xmath230% of which have experienced a major merger during the time spanning our redshift range . for less massive galaxies ( @xmath226m@xmath6 ) , such mergers play a less significant role , affecting less than 10% of the population . for systems at such intermediate and lower masses ,",
    "star formation is likely to be of much greater importance in driving growth .",
    "the higher merger fraction observed for the more massive galaxies in our sample provides direct support for hierarchical assembly and agrees with recent galaxy models based on n - body simulations , even if additional processes are required to explain the top - down nature of star formation downsizing and the formation of spheroidal galaxies .",

    "more than half of our pointings were strongly affected , and the typical peak - to - trough fringe height was a few percent of the background level .",
    "we traced the cause to two problems .",
    "first , strong fringing in one or two frames in an image set would be imprinted into other frames via the skyflat procedure and second , skyflats in mcsred are made by averaging all images in a set .",
    "the flat field can vary over timescales of minutes , however , and changes ( as well as the fringing ) may be related to dithering the telescope .",
    "thus a `` running '' sky flat that includes only some images taken before and after the science frame is desirable .",
    "we wrote a separate procedure which constructs running skyflats to flatfield the data and allows frames with bad fringing to be removed .",
    "the image registration portion of mcsred also caused occasional problems , with some images being excluded from the final mosaic . by default , mcsred calls the iraf routine xyxymatch with the automated `` triangles '' registration option , which can sometimes fail for certain frames .",

    "<S> using deep infrared observations conducted with the moircs imager on the subaru telescope in the northern goods field combined with public surveys in goods - s , we investigate the dependence on stellar mass , @xmath0 , and galaxy type of the close pair fraction ( @xmath1 ) and implied merger rate . in terms of combined depth and survey area , </S>",
    "<S> our publicly available mass - limited sample represents a significant improvement over earlier infrared surveys used for this purpose . in common with some recent studies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major mergers is low ( @xmath24% ) and does not increase significantly with redshift to @xmath3 , with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our key finding is that massive galaxies with @xmath5m@xmath6  are more likely to host merging companions than less massive systems ( @xmath7m@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red , spheroidal hosts compared to blue , late - type systems , in line with expectations based on clustering at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> so - called `` dry '' mergers between early - type galaxies devoid of star formation represent nearly 50% of close pairs with @xmath8m@xmath6  at @xmath9 , but less than 30% at @xmath10 . this result can be explained by the increasing abundance of red , early - type galaxies at these masses . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the volumetric merger rate of galaxies with different masses to mass - dependent trends in galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our results reaffirm the conclusion of @xcite that major mergers do not fully account for the formation of spheroidal galaxies since @xmath10 . in terms of mass assembly , </S>",
    "<S> major mergers contribute little to galaxy growth below @xmath11m@xmath6  but play a more significant role among galaxies with @xmath12m@xmath6 @xmath230% of which have undergone mostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the relatively rapid and recent coalescence of high mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchical growth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions , even if the top - down suppression of star formation and morphological evolution ( i.e. , `` downsizing '' ) involves additional physical processes . </S>"
