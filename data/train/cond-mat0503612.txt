    "<S> the mechanism of stokes shift in semiconductor quantum dots is investigated by calculating the energy of the excitonic states . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken into account all possible contributions to the total electronic energy in the dot , i.e , dielectric mismatch between dot and surrounding medium , the effects of finite barrier height and electron - hole exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the stokes shift is calculated as a function of radius of dot and compared with experimental data on two different semiconductor based quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide evidence for exchange splitting of excitonic states , as the mechanism of stokes shift in quantum dot    the red shift of the emission spectra with respect to absorption spectra is known as stokes shift , which is commonly observed in semiconductor quantum dots(qds ) and the most important quantity that determines the optical properties of qds . </S>",
    "<S> however the underlying mechanism of stokes shift is still controversial . in case of semiconductor qds </S>",
    "<S> , this shift decreases with the increase in radius of the dot and disappears beyond a certain radius . </S>",
    "<S> the red shift , principally , occurs if either the top of the valence band is an optically passive state ( say p state ) or if the electron and the hole are in a triplet state . </S>",
    "<S> absorption of a photon from the top of the valence band in such cases is not allowed and is possible only from an optically active state lying deeper in the valence band . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton , once formed after absorption , can not decay to the top of the valence band by direct dipole transition and hence is called `` dark exciton''@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> deexcitation eventually takes place with the help of phonons thus giving rise to red shifted photons .    </S>",
    "<S> two different mechanisms@xcite@xmath0@xcite have been proposed to explain the origin of stokes shift in semiconductor qds , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . absorption takes place from the s - state which lies deeper than the p - state in the valence band to form an exciton in the singlet state of the electron and hole . according to the first mechanism , ( 1 ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , deexcitation takes place into the p state with the help of phonons giving rise to a stokes shift by an amount @xmath1 representing the difference in energy between the exciton states formed with s and p hole states(ref.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to the second mechanism the exciton in the singlet state first thermalizes into a triplet state from where it deexcites with the help of phonons either ( a ) to the deeper lying original s state , ( 2 ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , giving rise to a stokes shift by an amount @xmath2 representing the singlet triplet splitting(ref . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) , or ( b ) to the p state at the top of the valence band , ( 3 ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , with the stokes shift given by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , the red shift is also observed if the final excited state has a different atomic configuration than the initial ground state . </S>",
    "<S> such a red shift , known as frank condon shift , is commonly observed in molecules and point defects in solids and may be relevant in ultra small qds@xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the origin of stokes shift in iii - v(inas ) and ii - vi(cdse ) semiconductor based qds by calculating the energies of excitonic states . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken into account the dielectric mismatch effects , the effect of finite barrier height and the effect of the electron hole exchange interaction and then compared the results with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> inas and cdse are chosen because of their ( i ) different crystal structures , ( ii ) different crystal field effects which is zero in zinc blende structures(i.e inas ) but significantly large in wurtzite structure(cdse ) , ( iii ) different effective masses which is small in inas , but large for cdse and ( iv ) different nature of bonds . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed experimentally@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite that the red shift decreases with radius and disappears beyond a certain radius . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the strong dependence of stokes shift on the radius of the qd , is used to investigate the origin of stokes shift in qds based on these semiconductors(inas , cdse ) .    </S>",
    "<S> optical transitions from the electron state @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the bloch functions of the conduction band , are possible only to hole states in the valence band which have the s - state as a component because @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical transition probability from the bottom of the conduction band to a hole state in the valence band is given by @xcite @xmath7 , where c is the component of the s - state @xmath8 in the hole wavefunction , @xmath9 is the spin projection of the removed electron in the hole state and @xmath10 are the bloch wavefunctions of the hole states at the valence band top . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 is zero if @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> optical transitions from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band is not possible if either ( 1 ) the hole state does not have a component of the s - state ( i.e if c=0 ) , or ( 2 ) the spin projections of the removed electron in the hole state and the electron in the conduction band are not equal , @xmath12 . since the hole spin is obtained by flipping the spin of the removed electron , it follows that optical transitions are not possible if the spins of the electron and the hole are parallel i.e if they are in a triplet state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the top of the valence band is a p - state , or the electron and the hole are in a triplet state , a _ dark exciton _ is formed .    </S>",
    "<S> the exciton states are obtained from the hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the electronic hamiltonian , the hole hamiltonian , the spin - orbit interaction and the e - h coulomb interaction respectively given in ref.2 and 7 . </S>",
    "<S> the last two terms represent the surface polarization energies arising due to the difference in the dielectric constants between the semiconductor quantum dot and the surrounding medium@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the self energy of the electron and hole due to their image charges and @xmath16 is the mutual interaction energy between the electron and hole via image charges . </S>",
    "<S> the excitonic states obtained from eq.([h1 ] ) will be split further due to exchange interaction@xcite @xmath17 between the electron and hole .    </S>",
    "<S> since the nature of the state at the top of the valence band plays a pivotal role in the formation of dark and bright excitons , we first investigate the hole states for both the zinc - blende and wurtzite structures using the * k.p * hole hamiltonian @xmath18 given in ref.9 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigenvalues of the hole states without inclusion of excitonic effects as a function of dot radius for inas(zinc - blende structures ) and cdse(wurtzite structures ) are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 3(a ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these eigenvalues get modified when coulomb interaction between electron in the conduction band and hole in the valence band are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results including excitonic effects are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) and 3(b ) respectively .    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) we observe that in inas the optically passive @xmath19 is the ground state which lies below the first optically active state @xmath20 state . </S>",
    "<S> the states are labeled @xmath20 , @xmath19 etc where the capital letters correspond to the lowest @xmath21 present and the subscripts gives the total angular momentum @xmath22=@xmath23 , where @xmath21 is the orbital angular momentum , @xmath24(=1 ) is angular momentum of the bloch wavefunction at the valence band top and @xmath25 is the spin of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in energy between the optically passive @xmath19 state and the optically active @xmath20 state decreases as the radius of the dot increases and eventually @xmath20 becomes the ground state at around @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> hence dark exciton formation and associated stokes shift will be observed below this radius .    for the wurtzite structure , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is axially symmetric and only the z - component @xmath27 of the total angular momentum is conserved . from fig.3(a ) </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that for cdse the optically passive @xmath28 with @xmath29 state is the ground state at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of @xmath28 in units of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is a luttinger parameter ) has an upward slope as a function of radius and crosses the relatively flat @xmath33 state with @xmath34 at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> dark exciton formation and stokes shift is predicted for cdse below @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the trend of s - state and p state can be explained by observing that @xmath33 with @xmath34 is predominantly made from only one state with composition @xmath36 whose energy decreases as @xmath37 but in units of @xmath38 is independent of r and hence the state is relatively flat . </S>",
    "<S> but the optically passive p state with @xmath29 can be made either from the state with composition @xmath39 or the state with the composition @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these two states are separated from each other by spin - orbit interaction . at very low radii spin orbit effects </S>",
    "<S> are negligible relative to kinetic energy terms due to confinement . </S>",
    "<S> hence the two states are almost degenerate at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between these two states give rise to a splitting of the states with the lower p state lying below the s state . as the radius increases the energies of both </S>",
    "<S> the s and p states decrease . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of s state decreases as @xmath37 but the energy of the p state decreases more slowly because of the presence of the spin - orbit interaction energy which becomes important as the kinetic energy starts decreasing with the increase of radius </S>",
    "<S> . eventually the two levels cross . in figs . 2 and 3 the energies have been shown in the units of @xmath38 .    when the coulomb interaction between the electron in @xmath41 state and the hole is taken into account , </S>",
    "<S> the energies decrease . the decrease in energy of s - state is more than that of p state , the overlap between @xmath41 state and s state of the hole being greater . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the crossing between s and p states to occur at lower values of r as can be seen from comparison of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) and 3(b ) with the corresponding figs . 2(a ) and 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the excitonic s and p states @xmath42 as a function of r , are shown in the insets to figs . 4 and 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface polarization charges arising due to the dielectric mismatch between the dot and the surroundings also affect the excitonic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of self energy @xmath15 and attractive energy @xmath16 are opposite in sign and comparable in magnitude@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the dielectric mismatch effects are greatly reduced with the net effect being an increase in energy depending on the amount of dielectric mismatch between the dot and the surrounding . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in energy for the p state is more than that for the s state resulting in a crossover to occur at a lower dot radius . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from figs.2(b ) and 3(b ) which gives the comparison between zero and finite dielectric mismatch , i.e @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the self energy of a charge confined to a spherical dielectric is minimum@xcite at r=0 . since @xmath45 for the p - state is larger compared to the s - state , the self energy @xmath15 is higher for the p - state . but the attractive energy @xmath16 is higher for the s state compared to the p state . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a higher net increase of polarization contribution @xmath46 $ ] for the p - state as compared to the s - state and hence to a shifting of the s - p crossover to lower values of r as can be seen from figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b)and 3(b ) .    another cause of dark exciton formation and the consequent stokes shift is the splitting of the active exciton states due to electron hole exchange interaction@xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the exchange strength constant , @xmath49 the lattice constant , @xmath50 the pauli spin matrices representing the electron spin and @xmath51 is the hole spin matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction gives rise to a splitting between triplet and singlet state of the electron and hole , with the triplet state lying lower in energy . </S>",
    "<S> the triplet state being passive , excitation takes place to the higher singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> deexcitation can take place from the triplet state reached by thermalization , thus giving rise to a red shift of the emmision spectra with respect to the absorption spectra .    in inas the first optically active s state ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ) has total anguar momentum @xmath52 @xmath53(@xmath21 = 0 , @xmath24=1 , @xmath25=@xmath54 ) and is fourfold degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath41 electron state in the conduction band being doubly degenerate , the exciton states are eightfold degenerate in the absence of exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction splits these degenerate levels into two : the lower optically passive triplet state with @xmath55=2(@xmath56 ) and the upper optically active singlet state with @xmath55=1 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in energies @xmath2 between the singlet and triplet states as a function of dot radius is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . @xmath2 decreases with r and vanishes at @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction is enhanced with decrease in radius because of the increase in the overlap of electron and hole wavefunctions due to confinement .    in cdse ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ) the ground state with @xmath58 can be obtained by coupling a hole with @xmath59 with the electron state with @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> since these combinations form triplet states , the ground state with @xmath58 is optically passive and forms a dark exciton . </S>",
    "<S> the first excited state with @xmath61=@xmath62 can be obtained either by coupling @xmath63=@xmath64 , @xmath65=@xmath66 or alternatively by @xmath63=@xmath67 with @xmath65=@xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath68 will be a mixture of singlet and triplet states and will be optically active . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in energies @xmath2 between the optically passive ground state and the first optically active excited state as function of r for cdse is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . as in the case of inas , @xmath2 for cdse also decreases with r and vanishes around @xmath26 .    as seen from figs . 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 </S>",
    "<S> the curves corresponding to finite barrier case lie lower than infinite barrier case . </S>",
    "<S> both the exchange interaction and coulomb interaction depend on the amount of overlap of electron and hole wavefunctions , which is reduced in the finite barrier case due to penetration of the substantial amount of electron wavefunction outside the dot resulting in the decrease of exchange energy and coulomb binding energy .    having theoretically calculated @xmath1 and @xmath2 we are in a position to investigate the various mechanisms for stokes shift given in fig . 1 by comparison with experimental data . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4 and 5 are shown the plots of @xmath2 as a function of the dot radius together with the experimentally observed stokes shift for cdse and inas respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 as a function of r for these cases are shown in the insets of the corresponding figures . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that @xmath1 is much larger than the experimental red shift for inas . for cdse , as seen from the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 at @xmath30 @xmath1 is almost the same as the experimental stokes shift but for larger values of r the experimental values are much higher . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen from figs . 4 and 5 that @xmath2 fits the experimental data rather well . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the fit for cdse corresponds to an infinite barrier at the dot radius but for inas a good fit is obtained for a finite barrier height . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by observing that the effective mass of electron in inas is very small and hence the lowest eigenvalue lies near the top of the barrier height and there is substantial probability of finding the electron outside the dot . for cdse , </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass of electron is large and the lowest eigenvalue lies near the bottom of the potential well , making the infinite barrier effects predominant . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 we have also plotted the theoretical curve for stokes shift obtained by efros et al@xcite in which the coulomb interaction between the electron and hole was not taken into account . we observe that better agreement with experimental stokes shift is obtained by our theoretical curve which takes into account the coulomb interaction .    from a comparision of the theoretical results with experimental data </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the stokes shift observed in qds is caused by the splitting of the exciton states by the electron hole exchange interaction through the deexcitation mechanism ( 2 ) in fig </S>",
