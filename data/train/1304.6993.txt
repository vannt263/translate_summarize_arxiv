    "the high  amplitude @xmath0 sct ( hads ) stars are defined as a population i subgroup of @xmath0sct type variables .",
    "they are located in the central part of the instability strip @xcite in the core or shell hydrogen burning stage of stellar evolution and appear to be intermediate between normal @xmath0  scuti stars and classical cepheids .",
    "however , the distinction between hads and other @xmath0sct stars is still rather arbitrary @xcite . their large amplitude , which typically exceeds 0.3mag , and the presence of many combination frequencies caused by nonlinear coupling between the principal modes are the defining characteristics @xcite . in general , the hads appear to pulsate mostly in the fundamental and first overtone radial modes @xcite .",
    "however , they need not to be purely radial pulsators , since recent studies have shown that some high - amplitude modes are nonradial @xcite .",
    "kic6382916 ( asas 194803 + 4146.9 , @xmath9 ) was first monitored during the asas3 north station observations and reported as a double - mode hads star with a period ratio @xmath10 by @xcite .",
    "the star has also been observed by the _ kepler _ satellite in short - cadence ( sc , 1min exposures ) and long - cadence ( lc , 30min exposures ) modes @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ observations are very important as they allow us to fix the frequencies with great precision .",
    "we can use these frequencies to fit the multicolour ground - based observations and to determine the amplitudes and phases for the purpose of mode identification .    in this paper , we present results of a multi - site photometric and spectroscopic campaign on the hads star kic6382916 in order to identify the modes of pulsation .",
    "mode identification is the first step in using the frequencies to determine the stellar parameters ( asteroseismology ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we first present a detailed description of the ground- and space - based observations including method of data reduction and frequency analyses .",
    "mode identification , which is the main purpose of this study , is presented in section 6 .",
    "finally , we discuss these results .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained at two different sites .",
    "the first set of spectra were obtained with the 2-m rcc telescope of the bulgarian national astronomical observatory , rozhen .",
    "we observed the star during two nights ( 2011 july 8 and 9 ) and in three spectral regions 48004910   ( h@xmath11 ) , 45004610  ( si lines ) and 63906500  ( fe lines ) .",
    "a photometrics at200 camera with a site si003ab @xmath12 ccd chip ( @xmath13 pixel size ) was used in the third camera of the coud spectrograph to provide spectra with a typical resolution of r = 32000 and a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of about 50 .",
    "the exposure times were 1800s .",
    "the intrinsic spectral line profile , which halfwidth gave about 9kms@xmath3near 6500 , was determined from the arc spectrum .",
    "standard iraf procedures were used for bias subtraction , flat - fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "we also obtained spectra of kic6382916 using the wiro longslit spectrograph with an e2v @xmath14 ccd as detector .",
    "an 1800  l  mm@xmath3 grating in first order yielded a spectral resolution of 1.5  near 5800  with a 1.2@xmath15100   slit .",
    "the spectral coverage was 52506750   .",
    "individual exposure times were 600  s. reductions followed standard longslit techniques .",
    "each spectrum was shifted by a small amount in velocity so that the na  i  d @xmath165890 , 5996 lines were registered with the mean nai line wavelength across the ensemble of observations .",
    "this zero - point correction to each observation is needed to account for the effects of image wander in the dispersion direction when the stellar fwhm of the point spread function is appreciably less than the slit width .",
    "multiple exposures were then combined , yielding a final s / n ratio typically in excess of 60 near 5800 .",
    "model atmospheres were calculated using the atlas12 code .",
    "the vald atomic line database ( @xcite ) , which also contains @xcite data , was used to create a line list for the synthetic spectra .",
    "the synspec code ( @xcite , @xcite ) was used to generate synthetic spectra adopting a microturbulence of 2kms@xmath3 .",
    "the computed spectra were convolved with the instrumental profile ( a gaussian of 0.2  fwhm for the coud spectra and 1.5  fwhm for the wiro spectra ) and rotationally broadened to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "line ( dots ) fitted with a model with @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( cgs ) ( solid line ) .",
    "two other models - @xmath19 ( long - dashed line ) and @xmath20 ( dashed line ) are given for comparison . ]",
    "the best fit for the h@xmath11 and h@xmath21 lines was obtained for @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "we used the mgii @xmath244481  line for the determination of projected rotational velocity .",
    "the match between the synthetic and observed profile resulted in @xmath25 . in fig.[figspec",
    "] we show the best fit for h@xmath11 together with a fit using two other effective temperatures for comparison .",
    "_ kepler _ data were used to derive the frequency content of kic6382916 .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission , designed to detect earth - like planets using the transit method @xcite , was launched on 2009 march 6 .",
    "_ kepler _ has observed , and is continuing to observe , about 150000 stars in a fixed field of view . the superb photometric precision and the almost continuous data coverage is of great advantage in determining the pulsational frequencies which can then be used to fit the ground - based data . _ kepler _ observations consist mostly of long - cadence ( lc ) exposures of 30-min duration , but a few thousand stars , including kic6382916 ,",
    "were observed using 1-min ( short cadence , sc ) exposures .",
    "the lc data are of limited value since the maximum frequency that can be extracted is about 24d@xmath3 .",
    "we therefore used only the sc data which consists of 38314 points between jd2455064.38 and jd2455091.48 ( 27.1d ) taken at _",
    "quarter 2.3 ( q2.3 ) . with sc data frequencies as high as 700d@xmath3 can be detected if they are present .",
    "the data were prepared for analysis by cotrending and detrending the simple aperture photometry ( sap ) fluxes .",
    "the cotrending process was applied to the q2.3 data using cotrending basis vector ( cbv ) files which help to remove instrumental systematics from the light curve @xcite .",
    "kepcotrend package that is provided by nasa kepler science center is used during cotrending process .",
    "all data points were converted to magnitudes ( m@xmath26 ) using the formula @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the raw sap flux . a linear trend to @xmath29 as a function of time",
    "was removed so that the final magnitudes have zero mean .",
    "we used period04 @xcite to perform the frequency extraction .",
    "frequencies were extracted by successive prewhitening until the signal - to - noise threshold s / n @xmath30 3.5 was reached . all peaks with s / n greater than this value were deemed significant @xcite .",
    "we found that the light curve can be described by two independent frequencies , @xmath31 and @xmath32d@xmath3 , together with their harmonics and a few hundred combination terms .",
    "a third independent frequency , @xmath33d@xmath3 , is also present but has a much lower amplitude . the amplitude spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "analysis of short - cadence _ kepler _ photometry was used to determine the pulsation frequencies in kic6382916 .",
    "we find two large - amplitude independent modes with frequencies @xmath6 = 4.9107 and @xmath7 = 6.43137d@xmath3 as previously reported by pigulski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) from ground - based observations .",
    "we found a third independent frequency at @xmath41d@xmath3 which has a much lower amplitude .",
    "the frequency spectrum is dominated by @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their harmonics and combination frequencies .    in hads",
    "stars the modes of highest amplitude are generally radial modes since in many stars the period ratio @xmath42 of first overtone to fundamental radial modes is close to the expected value @xmath43 .",
    "the stars lie on a curve defined by @xmath42 as a function of @xmath44 which is called the petersen diagram @xcite .",
    "the period ratio depends on metallicity , rotation and chemical abundance @xcite . in kic6382916",
    "the period ratio for the two modes of highest amplitude is @xmath6/@xmath7=0.763 which differs significantly from the expected period ratio for fundamental and first overtone radial modes .",
    "it therefore seems that at least one of the two modes is probably a nonradial mode .",
    "this may not be too surprising since recent studies suggest that the radial mode need not be present in all hads stars @xcite .    to determine the spherical harmonic degree of the three independent modes in kic6382916 we first of all need to know the stellar parameters as accurately as possible .",
    "for this purpose we obtained high - dispersion spectra and estimated an effective temperature @xmath45k and @xmath46 by matching the balmer line profiles with profiles calculated from synthetic spectra . from the effective temperature and surface gravity we estimate the mass as @xmath47 .",
    "mode identification is best done by comparing the relative amplitude ratios and/or phase differences in different photometric wavebands for the required mode with the calculated values . for this purpose",
    "we initiated a multi - site photometric campaign to observe kic6382916 in the @xmath48 bands .",
    "we used the frequencies derived from the _ kepler _ data as fixed values and fitted a truncated fourier series to the data from each wave band using the seven frequencies of highest amplitude .",
    "the resulting amplitude and phases were used to construct the relative amplitudes and phase differences , normalized to the @xmath49 band , for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we then used the famias software package @xcite to calculated amplitude ratios and phase differences for models with stellar parameters approximately corresponding to the spectroscopic values mentioned above .",
    "it turns out that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both dipole ( @xmath50 ) modes and that @xmath8 is either @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "if the identification for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 is correct , it calls to mind the case of 1mon @xcite . in this star",
    "there are three modes : a central radial mode flanked by two @xmath50 modes . in any case",
    "it seems that we need to be cautious in attributing the high - amplitude modes in hads stars as radial modes , though this is probably true in the majority of cases .",
    "it is important to compare the observed frequencies of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with model frequencies for @xmath50 .",
    "however , we are faced with the problem that rotation strongly modifies the frequencies of the @xmath53 modes .",
    "we therefore need to estimate the possible frequency shift owing to this effect which requires knowledge of the rotation frequency . in some @xmath0sct stars , it is possible to detect the rotational frequency directly from the periodogram of the _ kepler _ data by looking for the presence of a low - frequency peak and its harmonic .",
    "the presence of an harmonic is an indicator that the peak is due to a starspot and hence the frequency is the rotational frequency @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no such peak is visible in kic6382916 .",
    "the alternative is to estimate the rotational frequency from the projected rotational velocity @xmath54kms@xmath3 and the stellar radius .",
    "the stellar radius is estimated to be about 3.69@xmath550.14@xmath56 using the relationships by @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the star is roughly equator - on , the equatorial rotational velocity will probably be about 50 kms@xmath3 and the rotation frequency around 0.27d@xmath3 .",
    "if the star is equator - on , only sectorial modes will be visible and the frequency shift will roughly be the same as the rotation frequency .",
    "thus we may expect the frequencies in the non - rotating frame to be in the range @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we can compare these frequencies with frequencies calculated from non - rotating models .",
    "for this purpose , models of @xmath0  scuti stars with masses in the range @xmath59 were constructed using the warsaw - new jersey code @xcite .",
    "these models use opal opacities , no core overshoot and a mixing length , @xmath60 .",
    "pulsation frequencies for each model were obtained using the nadrot code @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all modes with frequencies less than about 6.1d@xmath3 are stable .",
    "one may argue that the rotation frequency is much larger and that the rotation correction would then bring @xmath6 closer to the this value .",
    "this argument can not be correct since this would imply a nearly pole - on orientation , in which case sectorial modes are no longer visible .",
    "we are thus faced with the problem that current models are unable to account for driving at the low frequency of @xmath6 .",
    "models where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both present ( but with @xmath6 stable ) all have @xmath61k and @xmath62 which is roughly in the range of the values determined from spectroscopy . in the model ,",
    "frequencies in the range of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are mixed p and g modes of high radial order , but this does not mean that the observed modes are also of this kind since no model is capable of driving these frequencies .",
    "the lowest frequency of a p mode for models in the above parameter range is about 8.6 d@xmath3 .",
    "they all appear to be g modes of high order .",
    "the lowest frequency of a p mode for models in the above parameter range is about 8.6d@xmath3 .    in conclusion , we find that the two modes of highest amplitude in kic6382916 are not only dipole modes , contrary to expectation , but are high - order g modes which are predicted to be stable in the models . unless the derived stellar parameters are grossly in error , this would imply a problem in our understanding of pulsational driving in @xmath0  scuti stars . we know that there is a problem with the models in that the observed range of instability is wider than the calculated range for @xmath0  sct stars @xcite .",
    "it appears that the presence of two high - amplitude g modes in kic6382916 is further confirmation of this problem .",
