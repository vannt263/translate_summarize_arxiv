    "scientific portals such as pubmed , google scholar , microsoft academic search , citeseer@xmath2 , and arnetminer provide access to scholarly publications and comprise indispensable resources for researchers who search for literature on specific subject topics .",
    "in addition , data mining applications such as citation recommendation  @xcite , expert search  @xcite , topic trend detection  @xcite , and author influence modeling  @xcite involve web - scale analysis of up - to - date research collections .",
    "while academics and researchers continue to produce large numbers of scholarly documents worldwide , acquisition of research document collections becomes a challenging task for digital libraries .",
    "in contrast with commercial portals ( such as the acm digital library ) that rely on clean and structured publishing sources for their collections , open - access , autonomous systems such as citeseer@xmath2 and arnetminer acquire and index freely - available research articles on the web  @xcite .",
    "researchers homepages and paper repository urls are crawled and processed periodically for maintaining the research collections in these portals .",
    "needless to say , these repositories are incomplete since the crawl seed lists can not be comprehensive in face of the ever changing scholarly web .",
    "not only do new authors and publication venues emerge , but also existing researchers may stop publishing or change universities resulting in outdated seed urls .",
    "_ given this challenge , how can we automatically augment crawl seed lists for a scientific digital library ?",
    "_    web search has been a constant topic of investigation for ir , ml , and ai research groups since several years .",
    "current web search engines feature state - of - the - art technologies , ranking algorithms , syntax , personalization and localization features along with efficient infrastructure and programmable apis making them invaluable tools to access and process the otherwise intractable web . despite these attractive advancements , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "search - driven methods are yet to be investigated as alternatives to crawl - based approaches for acquiring documents in digital libraries . in this paper",
    ", we address this gap in the context of open - access , scientific digital libraries .",
    "we propose a novel search / crawl framework , describe its components and present experiments showcasing its potential in acquiring research documents .",
    "to motivate our framework , we recall how a web user typically searches for research papers or authors  @xcite . as with regular document search ,",
    "a user typically issues web search queries comprising of representative keywords or paper titles for finding publications on a topic .",
    "similarly , if the author is known , a  navigational query \"  @xcite may be employed to locate the homepage where the paper is likely to be hosted . indeed , according to previous studies , researchers provide access to their papers ( when possible ) to improve their visibility and citation counts making researcher homepages a likely hub for locating research papers  @xcite .",
    "given previous knowledge in academic browsing , scholars are often able to accurately locate the correct research papers or academic homepages from the web search results using hints from the titles , search summaries ( or snippets ) and the url strings .",
    "to illustrate this process , figure  [ fig : anecdotalsearch ] shows an anecdotal example of a search using google for the title and authors of a paper published at ijcai last year , `` maximum satisfiability using cores and correction sets '' by nikolaj bjorner and nina narodytska .",
    "for the top-@xmath3 results shown for the paper title query ( set 1 ) , four of the five results are research papers on the topic .",
    "the document at the springer link is not available for free whereas the last document corresponds to course slides . for the homepage urls identified from author name search results ( from sets 2 and 3 ) , namely : +    ` http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/  ninan/ ` + ` http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/nbjorner/ ` + ` http://theory.stanford.edu/people/nikolaj/ `     + we found @xmath4 documents , @xmath5 of which correspond to research publications .",
    "this anecdotal search example highlights the immense potential of web search for retrieving research papers and seed urls that can be crawled for research papers .",
    "our search / crawl framework mimics precisely the above search and scrutinize approach adopted by scholarly web users . freely - available information from the web for specific subject disciplines is used to frame title and author name queries in our framework .",
    "the two control flow paths for obtaining research papers are highlighted in figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "research paper titles are used as queries in * path 1*. the documents resulting from this search are classified with a paper classifier based on random forests  @xcite .",
    "author names comprise the queries for web search in * path 2 * , the results of which are filtered using a homepage identification module trained using the ranksvm algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the predicted academic homepages serve as seeds for the crawler module that obtains all documents upto a depth @xmath6 starting from the seed url .",
    "the paper identification module is once again employed to retain only those documents relevant to a scientific digital library among the crawled documents .",
    "we summarize our contributions below :    * we propose a novel framework based on search - driven methods to automatically acquire research documents for scientific collections . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to use  web search \" to obtain seed urls for initiating crawls in an open - access digital library . * our search / crawl framework interleaves several existing and new modules .",
    "we extend existing research on academic document classification to identify research papers among documents .",
    "next , we design a novel homepage identification module , a crucial component for our framework , that uses several features based on webpage titles , url strings , and terms in the result snippet to identify researcher homepages from the results of author name search .",
    "the identified homepages form seeds for our web crawler .",
    "* we provide a thorough evaluation of both the paper and homepage identification components using various publicly - available datasets .",
    "our proposed features attain state - of - the - art performance on both these tasks . *",
    "finally , we perform a large - scale , first - of - its - kind experiment using @xmath7 research paper titles and @xmath8 author names from computer science .",
    "we not only recovered approximately @xmath9% of the papers corresponding to the research paper title queries but were also able to collect about @xmath0 million research documents overall with our framework .",
    "these impressive yields showcase our web - search driven methods to be highly effective for obtaining and maintaining up - to - date document collections in open - access digital library portals .",
    "we provide details of our paper and homepage identification modules in section  [ sec : methods ] . in section  [ sec : expts ] , we describe our experimental setup , results , and findings .",
    "we briefly summarize closely - related work in section  [ sec : related ] and present concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the accuracy and efficiency our search / crawl framework is contingent on the accuracies of two components : ( 1 ) the homepage identifier and ( 2 ) the paper classifier .    * homepage identification * : academic homepages , known to link to research papers  @xcite , form potential seed urls for initiating crawls in digital libraries . for our search / crawl framework to be effective and efficient ,",
    "it is imperative to identify these pages from the search results of author name queries . identifying researcher homepages among other types of webpages",
    "can be treated as an instance of the webpage classification problem with the underlying classes : homepage / non - homepage  @xcite . however , given the web search setting , the non - homepages retrieved in response to an author name query can be expected to be diverse with webpages ranging from commercial websites such as linkedin , social media websites such as twitter and facebook , publication listings such as google scholar , research gate , and several more . to handle this aspect ,",
    "we draw ideas from the recent developments in web search ranking and frame homepage identification as a ranking problem .",
    "given a set of webpages in response to a query , our objective is to rank homepages better , i.e. , top ranks , relative to other types of webpages , capturing our preference among the webpages .",
    "for example , consider a name query  john blitzer \" and let the results in response to web search be : +    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     * sample evaluation . * given the size of the citeseer@xmath2 dataset and the large number of documents obtained via the search / crawl framework ( table  [ tab : csxresults ] ) , it is extremely labor - intensive to manually examine all documents resulting from this experiment .",
    "however , since our classifiers and rankers are not @xmath10 accurate and we only examine the top-@xmath11 results from the search engine , we need an estimate of how many papers we are able to obtain via our search / crawl approach among those that are actually obtainable on the web .",
    "we randomly selected @xmath12 titles from the citeseer@xmath2 dataset and their associated set of @xmath13 authors and inspected all pdfs that can be obtained via our search / crawl framework manually .",
    "that is , we searched for the selected paper titles and manually examineed and annotated the resulting pdfs .",
    "similarly , the correct homepages of the @xmath13 authors were obtained by searching the web and manually examining the resulting webpages .",
    "the correct homepages were crawled ( to depth 2 ) for pdfs and the resulting documents were manually labeled .",
    "we were able to locate @xmath14 correct homepages of the @xmath13 authors in this manual experiment . crawling",
    "these homepages resulted in @xmath15 pdfs out of which @xmath16 were found to be research papers .",
    "our search / crawl framework that crawls predicted homepages for the @xmath13 authors and uses paper classifier predictions to identify research papers was able to obtain @xmath17 research papers .",
    "out of these documents , @xmath18 match with the intended set of @xmath16 papers .",
    "thus , we are able to obtain approximately @xmath19 of the intended set of papers along with an additional @xmath20 new ones .",
    "paper search using titles results in @xmath21 pdfs out of which @xmath22 are true papers .",
    "our paper classifier obtains a precision / recall of @xmath23%/@xmath24% , predicting @xmath25 out of these @xmath22 papers correctly and @xmath26 papers overall .",
    "homepage finding and document classification are very well - studied problems . due to space constraints",
    ", we refer the reader to the trec 2001 proceedings and the comprehensive reviews of the feature representations , methods , and results for various text / webpage classification problems  @xcite .    though homepage finding in trec did not specifically address researcher homepages , this track resulted in various state - of - the - art machine learning systems for finding homepages  @xcite . among works focusing specifically on researcher homepages ,",
    "both tang et al .   and gollapalli et al .",
    "treat homepage finding as a binary classification task and use various url and content features .",
    "ranking methods were explored for homepage finding using the top terms obtained from topic models  @xcite .    in the context of scientific digital libraries , document classification into classes related to subject - topics ( for example ,  machine learning \" ,  databases \" ) was studied previously  @xcite .",
    "often bag - of - words features as well as topics extracted using lda / plsa are used to represent the underlying documents in these works .",
    "structural features , on the other hand , are popular in classifying and clustering semi - structured xml documents  @xcite . in contrast with existing work , we investigate features from web search engine results and formulate researcher homepage identification as a learning to rank task . in addition , we are the first to interleave various ai components with existing web search and crawl modules to build an efficient paper acquisition framework .",
    "we proposed a search - driven framework for automatically acquiring research documents on the web as an alternative to crawl - driven methods adopted in current open - access digital libraries .",
    "our framework crucially depends on accurate paper classification and researcher homepage identification modules . to this end , we discussed features for these modules and showed experiments illustrating their state - of - the - art performance . in one experiment using a large collection of about @xmath1 million queries ,",
    "our framework was able to automatically acquire a collection of approximately @xmath0 million research documents .",
    "these results showcase the potential of our proposed framework in improving scientific digital library collections . for future work , apart from improving the accuracies of individual components in our framework , we will focus on including other document formats ( for example , .ps and zipped files ) as well as other document types ( for example , course materials ) .",
    "we are grateful to dr . c. lee giles for the citeseerx data .",
    "we also thank corina florescu and kishore neppalli for their help with various dataset construction tasks .",
