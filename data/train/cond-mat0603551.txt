    "investigations of the adsorption of alkali metals on single - crystal metal surfaces has a long tradition in surface science .",
    "this is partly due to potential technological applications like the promotion of catalytic reactions , an enhanced oxidation , @xcite and an increase in electron emission rates .",
    "@xcite moreover alkali metal atoms are , due to their simple electronic structure , candidates for model chemisorption studies as reviewed , for instance , in refs .   and .",
    "recently published articles @xcite focus on the investigation of electronic and dynamic properties of cs layers on cu(111 ) .",
    "consequently , it is important to study the geometrical structure of this adsorbate system . before addressing the particular adsorbate system",
    "cu(111)-cs we give a general overview of alkali metals adsorbed on surfaces .",
    "an excellent review on this subject has been given by diehl and mcrath .",
    "@xcite    structural characterization of alkali adsorbate systems has been a central issue and resulted in the following general picture of alkali adsorption on metal surfaces .",
    "due to charge transfer from the adsorbed alkali atom to the substrate , the alkali adatoms become partially charged .",
    "@xcite the induced dipole moment then causes the alkali atoms to mutually repel leading to homogeneous adatom arrangement . as a result ,",
    "at very low coverages low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) patterns reveal a ring around the ( 0,0 ) spot .",
    "@xcite the formation of such structures in leed patterns indicates a superstructure of randomly distributed adsorbed atoms ( adatoms ) with a prevailing mutual distance .",
    "in contrast , higher coverages lead to sharp diffraction spots indicating a periodic superstructure with long - range order . at room temperature , superstructures were observed only for commensurate phases , _",
    "e.g. _ , for co(@xmath1)-k,@xcite au(100)-k,@xcite and ni(111)-k.@xcite below room temperature , incommensurate phases were reported , for instance , for ag(111)-k , -rb , -cs,@xcite and ni(100)-k .",
    "@xcite rotation of an incommensurate adsorption layer ( adlayer ) with respect to the substrate , with the rotation angle depending continuously on the coverage , was observed for various systems , namely c(0001)-cs , @xcite pt(111)-na , @xcite pt(111)-k , @xcite ru(0001)-li , @xcite ru(0001)-na , @xcite ag(111)-k , -rb , -cs , @xcite cu(100)-k and ni(100)-k , @xcite , and rh(100)-cs .",

    "@xcite indicates that the adsorbate - substrate interactions exceed the repulsive adsorbate - adsorbate interactions at low coverages for these systems .",
    "additionally , these systems condense in ( higher - order ) commensurate phases which suggests that the energy gain from forming commensurate phases promotes island formation .",

    "did not increase the coverage .",
    "this adsorption layer revealed a p@xmath4 superstructure , with cs atoms occupying on - top adsorption sites . for lower coverages the ring formation in leed patterns as described above",
    "was observed .",
    "further studies of cu(111)-cs were reported by fan and coworkers .",
    "@xcite they examined adsorption structures in the temperature range between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . as a result the saturation coverage increases to @xmath7 at @xmath5 , where @xmath8 is defined as one cs atom per cu atom .",
    "_ did not report any commensurate phase for temperatures down to @xmath5 except for the already known p@xmath4 superstructure .",

    "@xcite the dynamics of quantum well states , which are localised in the ultrathin cs layer on cu(111 ) , have recently been investigated by a combined theoretical and tunneling spectroscopy study .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , in spite of the substantial interest in their dynamic and electronic properties a real - space analysis of the geometric structure of cs films on cu(111 ) at various coverages is still lacking . in this article",

    ". atomic resolution of the cs adlayer reveals incommensurate phases , which are rotated with respect to the cu(111 ) lattice .",
    "the rotation angle decreases with increasing coverage and vanishes at the p@xmath4 superstructure . at very low coverages",
    "a commensurate phase is found , which exhibits mutual cs distances of @xmath0 .",
    "this distance suggests an electronic stabilization of the adsorbate lattice : adsorbate - induced friedel oscillations of the substrate charge density provided by the cu(111 ) surface state give rise to an adsorbate - adsorbate distance corresponding to half the fermi wavelength of surface - state electrons .",
    "the experiments were performed in ultrahigh vacuum recipients with a base pressure of 10@xmath11pa .",
    "the home - made scanning tunneling microscope was operated at room temperature and at @xmath10 .",
    "clean cu(111 ) surfaces were obtained after several cycles of argon ion bombardment and annealing .",
    "crystalline order and adsorbate superstructures were monitored with leed and cleanliness was checked with stm .",

    "cesium was evaporated from a commercial dispenser @xcite keeping the pressure below @xmath12 . using a quartz microbalance",

    "we find that further exposure does not lead to an increase of the surface coverage in agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "the directions of close - packed atoms of the cu(111 ) surface were obtained by analyzing leed diffraction patterns with an accuracy of @xmath16 .",
    "we noticed that during extended leed measurements of cu(111)-p@xmath4cs the superstructure diffraction spots became less intense and less sharp when using electron kinetic energies in excess of @xmath17 on a timescale of @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamic leed experiments by lindgren _",

    "typical constant - current stm images of cu(111)-cs acquired at room temperature ( not shown ) do not reveal any adsorbate superstructure .",
    "we inferred the presence of the adsorbate from a noisy tunneling current , which we do not usually observe on clean metal surfaces .",
    "further , step edges were not imaged as straight lines . rather , step edges appear frayed in constant - current stm images .",
    "we attribute these observations to mobility and to tip - induced movements of the cs adatoms . due to the instability of the tunneling junction ,",
    "tunneling spectroscopy measurements were difficult to perform in a reproducible manner at room temperature .",
    "as a consequence we performed our experiments at @xmath10 .",
    "the data to be presented in the following were acquired at low temperature .",

    "[ low]a defects of the adsorption layer are observed .",
    "we attribute these defects to imperfections of the cs layer , _",

    "[ low]a is shown in fig .",
    "the black circles indicate the positions of cs atoms in the layer , while the white circles continue the hexagonal lattice inside the defect structure . from this image",
    "we infer that the dark area corresponds to missing cs atoms .",
    "the hexagonal order of the adatoms extends over large areas . in some regions ,",
    "atomic resolution of the adsorbate layer is lost during scanning .",
    "these regions appear as blurred stripes in the fast scanning direction ( from top to bottom in fig .",
    "[ low]d ) . in @xmath26 of the cases where the blurred stripes appear ,",
    "adjacent cs - covered areas are shifted with respect to each other by half a superlattice constant as indicated by white lines in fig .",
    "we attribute this observation to adjacent cs adsorption domains . in both domains",
    "cs atoms reside at stable adsorption sites , while in the region between the domains no such stable adsorption site is available . as a consequence ,",
    "cs atoms in these regions are prone to be moved by the tip leading to the observed loss of atomic resolution .",
    "higher cs coverages led to an increase of the radius of the ring structure in the leed pattern at room temperature pointing to a decrease of the average separation between cs atoms .",
    "@xcite a typical constant - current stm image of cu(111 ) covered with @xmath28 cs is shown in fig .",

    "the corrugation of the superlattice is @xmath30 which is considerably smaller than for @xmath20 .",
    "we attribute this observation to the cs adatoms being more densely packed at higher coverage . comparing with the cu(111 ) substrate lattice",
    "we find a rotation angle of the adsorbate layer of @xmath31 .",
    "we obtained the same values for the interatomic distance , the rotation angle , and the corrugation at various areas on the sample .    for cs coverages of @xmath32 and @xmath33 cs - cs distances of @xmath34 and",

    "the adsorbate layers are rotated with respect to the substrate lattice by @xmath36 and    @xmath37 , respectively . upon increasing the coverage",
    "the cs adlayer becomes more and more disrupted .",
    "instead of a closed adsorption layer numerous small cs islands are observed ( see the results for saturation coverage ) .      at @xmath15 the room temperature leed pattern reveals a clear @xmath4 superstructure . a typical constant - current stm image of this surface at @xmath10",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "the adsorption layer is characterized by a cs film revealing an increased number of imperfections compared to lower coverages .",
    "these imperfections , which appear as dark indentations at the given tunneling voltage exhibit a variety of sizes and shapes .",
    "we found that the dimensions of the imperfections ( apparent height and lateral size ) depend on the applied tunneling voltage .",
    "the measured interatomic distance of @xmath0 and the rotation angle of @xmath39 match well a @xmath40 commensurate phase .",
    "stabilization of this commensurate superstructure may arise from long - range adsorbate - adsorbate interactions mediated by substrate electrons .",
    "lau and kohn @xcite predicted that adsorbates may interact via friedel oscillations @xcite through the fact that the binding energy of one adsorbate depends on the substrate electron density , which oscillates around the other adsorbate .",

    "the first quantitative study of a long - range interaction mediated by a two - dimensional nearly free electron gas was reported by repp _",

    "an atomic superlattice was also observed for adsorbed ce atoms on a ag(111 ) surface .",
    "@xcite the observed @xmath48 periodicity of the superlattice was assigned to the interaction of surface - state electrons with the ce adatoms .",
    "the interaction energy between adsorbates as mediated by surface state electrons was found to be @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the fermi energy measured from the bottom of the surface - state band and @xmath51 is the fermi - level phase shift , which depends on the scatterer .",
    "@xcite inserting the experimentally observed mutual cs distance of @xmath52 into eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) leads to a phase shift of @xmath53 .",
    "this is close to the value of @xmath54 for cu and co on cu(111 ) .",
    "@xcite the similarity of these values indicates that the phase shift does not vary appreciably among these scatterers with different chemical nature . since the value of @xmath51 in our case ,",
    "i.e. _ , cu(111)-cs , is similar to the phase shifts obtained from the systems above , we have additional evidence that the interaction between cs adatoms at low coverages is mediated by the cu(111 ) surface state .      for the cs superlattices observed at intermediate coverages , we do not find a coincidence of the substrate and adsorbate lattice .",
    "consequently , on the basis of our stm investigation , we propose the adsorption layers in the intermediate coverage regime to be incommensurate .",
    "we further observed that the incommensurate adsorption phases are rotated with respect to the substrate lattice .",
    "the rotation angle of the incommensurate cs adsorbate layers on cu(111 ) as a function of the misfit @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "[ rot ] ( circles ) . here",
    "@xmath56 denotes the nearest - neighbor distance of the cs adsorption layer and @xmath57 the distance of the cs atoms in the p(@xmath58 superstructure .",
    "the lattice constant of the cu(111 ) substrate @xmath59 leads to a nearest - neighbor distance of cs adatoms in the p(@xmath14 ) superstructure of @xmath60 .",
    "we added data adapted from ref .   displaying the rotation angles for incommensurate phases of ag(111)-cs at 35k obtained by leed ( triangles ) .",
    "while a general trend of increasing rotation angle with increasing misfit ( decreasing coverage ) is observed for the two adsorbate systems , the rotation of adsorbate layers starts at larger misfits in the case of cu(111)-cs .",
    "the rotation of adsorbed overlayers relative to the substrate has been observed previously for other adsorption systems .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , several explanations of the rotational behavior of adlayers have been put forward .",
    "@xcite a simple geometrical model first applied by doering @xcite proposes that the overlayer forms a higher - order commensurate phase , where the superstructure unit cell is much larger than the unit cell of the substrate surface .",
    "this leads to a large number of possible rotation angles for each misfit .",
    "it remains unclear why a specific orientation of the higher - order commensurate phase arises .",
    "another geometrical model by bohr and grey @xcite makes use of domain formation .",
    "the domains in question are the result of a moir pattern : since the adlayer has larger interatomic spacings than the substrate there are domains where the adatoms are nearly in phase with substrate atoms ; the separating areas , where the displacement is larger , are called domain walls .",
    "@xcite the assumption of the model is that the layer aligns to the substrate in such a way that the domain walls are oriented in a high - symmetry direction of the substrate or of the layer to minimize energy . within the model by novaco and mctague @xcite the rotation angle of the adsorbate layer with respect to the substrate lattice is determined on the basis of a weak adsorbate - substrate interaction . within a semiclassical approximation novaco and",
    "mctague found the rotation angle to depend on the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse speed of sound in the adsorbate layer , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , and upon the ratio of the lattice constants of the substrate , @xmath63 , and the adsorbate layer , @xmath56 : @xmath64 }        \\label{mac}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . while the lattice constants are known , little is known about the sound velocities in thin films .",
    "for alkali metals on noble metal surfaces , phonon dispersion curves were measured for na , k and cs on cu(001 ) .",
    "@xcite from the phonon dispersion relations of cs on cu(001 ) , @xcite we know that @xmath67 , which leads to @xmath68 according to eq .",
    "( [ mac ] ) .",
    "we therefore calculated the ratio of sound velocities of the cs adsorption layer by solving the two - dimensional dynamical equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the excursion of atom @xmath71 in unit cell @xmath72 from equilibrium in direction @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the adatom mass , and @xmath75 are the coupling constants , which are calculated as the second derivative of the interaction potential . for the latter we assume a dipole potential .",
    "numerical calculations showed that including interactions ranging further than the nearest neighbor do not change the result significantly .",
    "since the rotation angle depends only upon the ratio of the sound velocities the actual dipole moment of cs atoms on cu(111 ) is not required for the calculation .",
    "we find @xmath76 and plot @xmath77 according to eq .",
    "( [ mac ] ) in fig .  [ rot ] as a full line .",
    "the model reproduces the experimentally observed trend correctly ( the larger the misfit , the larger the angle of rotation ) .",
    "however , the experimental result that rotation starts not until a certain misfit is exceeded is not accounted for by the model .",
    "this shortcoming of the model close to commensurate phases is known .",
    "a similar effect was reported for k and rb adsorbed on ag(111 ) .",
    "@xcite the authors interpreted their observation as follows : near commensurate phases where the misfit is small the domains become larger and more adatoms are nearly in phase with substrate atoms .",
    "this leads to a stronger interaction of substrate and adlayer , locking the adlayer to the substrate orientation .",
    "a theoretical model developed by shiba @xcite takes this into account and predicts that for a small misfit the domain walls of the layer remain aligned to a symmetry direction of the layer up to a critical misfit . for larger misfits ,",
    "the domain walls become too weak to keep the alignment , and the layer is rotated versus the substrate .",
    "the peculiar structure of the cs adsorbate film as seen in constant - current stm images of cu(111)-p(@xmath14)cs can be explained in terms of island growth .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction alkali metal adsorption on metal surfaces goes hand in hand with the creation of dipole moments due to charge transfer processes . at low coverages",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction leads to a repulsive cs - cs interaction . with increasing coverage , the cs adatoms depolarize and the repulsion decreases",
    "@xcite reaching a sufficiently high coverage the interatomic distance is small enough to favor metallic bonds @xcite and small islands are formed . with increasing size",
    "the islands eventually come close to each other and coalesce , thereby leaving behind unoccupied substrate areas .",
    "an additional contribution to the formation of the observed cs film structure may be due to different thermal expansion coefficients .",
    "copper contracts by @xmath78 when cooled from room temperature to @xmath79 , @xcite _ i.e. _ , the lattice constant reduces to @xmath80 at @xmath79 . for ( bulk ) cs published thermal expansion coefficients have not been found .",
    "taking corresponding data for potassium @xcite as an approximation for the thermal expansion coefficient of cs we estimate that the cs film contracts by @xmath81 upon cooling from room temperature to @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , the cs lattice constant reduces to @xmath82 .",
    "supposing that at room temperature the cs layer covers the complete surface , which is corroborated by our room temperature stm and leed studies , the different contraction of the cs adsorption layer and the cu surface leads to a coverage of @xmath83 of the surface at @xmath79 , leaving @xmath84 of the surface uncovered .",
    "analysing a variety of constant - current stm images of the p@xmath4cs superstructure we find that @xmath85 of the surface was covered . as a consequence , the different thermal contraction of the cs adsorption layer and the cu surface may contribute to the observed layer structure although can not explain the entire effect .",
    "we used low - temperature stm to investigate cu(111)-cs at various cs coverages .",
    "for very low coverages the cs adsorption layer reveals hexagonal order with a nearest - neighbor distance of @xmath0 .",
    "we interpret this adsorption phase as a commensurate superstructure stabilized by long - range interactions mediated by surface state electrons . for higher coverages we find incommensurate cs superlattices , which are rotated with respect to the cu(111 ) substrate lattice .",
    "in contrast to the high degree of order at low and intermediate coverages , the p@xmath4cs superstructure at saturation coverage exhibits a fairly large defect density .",

    "<S> using scanning tunneling microscopy at low temperatures we investigated cesium adsorbed on cu(111 ) . at low coverages we observe a hexagonally ordered cs adsorption layer with a mutual adsorbate distance of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this distance is discussed in terms of a commensurate adsorption superstructure which is stabilized by long - range adsorbate interactions mediated by cu(111 ) surface state electrons . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate coverages are characterized by incommensurate superstructures which are rotated with respect to the substrate lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation angle varies with coverage and follows a trend which is consistent with models of epitaxial rotation . with increasing coverage the adsorption layers </S>",
    "<S> are found to rotate toward alignment with the substrate . </S>"
