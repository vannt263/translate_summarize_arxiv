    "for a long time thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) have been believed to be the most promising dark matter ( dm ) candidates .",
    "it is because the correct order of the magnitude of the cross section for explaining the present relic density of the universe is naturally possible with wimps .",
    "particularly , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is a well - motivated particle coming from the promising particle physics model , i.e. the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , has attracted much attentions as an excellent example of wimp . actually , the universe relic density by wimp or lsp dm is the traditional scenario , which has been believed so far .",
    "however , recently some astrophysical experimental groups including pamela @xcite , atic @xcite , and the fermi - lat collaborations @xcite reported the very challenging observations in cosmic ray : pamela observed positron fractions [ @xmath5 exceeding the theoretical expectation @xcite above 10 gev upto 100 gev . on the other hand , the pamela s observations on anti - proton / proton flux ratio were quite consistent with the theoretical calculation .",
    "the atic and fermi - lat s observations exhibit excesses of @xmath6 flux in cosmic ray from 100 gev to 1 tev .",
    "they would result from the positron flux that keeps rising upto 1 tev .",
    "apparently the above observational results are very hard to be interpreted in view of the conventional mssm cold dm scenario : explaining the excess positrons with annihilations of majorana fermions such as the lsp needs a too huge boost factor .",
    "moreover , atic and fermi - lat s observations seem to require a tev scale dm , if they are caused indeed by dm annihilation or decay",
    ". however , tev scale dm seems to be disfavored by the gamma ray data , if the excess positron flux should be originated from the same physics explaining dm creation in the early universe , i.e. from dm annihilation @xcite .",
    "such astrophysical observations seem to destroy our traditional scenario on dm . in this article , however , it will be pointed out that such observations do _ not _ necessarily imply the presence of a new dm theory replacing the traditional one .",
    "we will propose two viable scenarios explaining them , in which the present relic density in the universe is assumed to be still supported by thermally produced wimp .",
    "let us consider dm decay scenario to explain the cosmic positron excess .",
    "`` helicity suppression '' is not valid in dm decay any longer . unlike the dm annihilation scenario ,",
    "dm decay scenario is relatively free from the gamma ray constraint , since the positron flux is just linearly proportional to the number density of dm @xcite . in the dm decay scenario ,",
    "however , there are some serious hurdles to overcome : ( 1 ) one is to naturally obtain the extremely small decay rate of the dm , @xmath7 sec.@xmath8 , and ( 2 ) the other is to _ naturally _ explain the relic density of the dm .",
    "the first hurdle could be somehow resolved by introducing an extra symmetry , an extra dm component with a tev scale mass , and grand unified theory ( gut ) scale superheavy particles , which mediate dm decay into the standard model ( sm ) charged leptons ( and the lsp ) @xcite .",
    "it is because the required decay rate of @xmath9 can be achieved , if the dominant operator for decay to @xmath10 is dimension 6 suppressed by @xmath11 , i.e. a four fermion interaction : @xmath12 where @xmath13 a few tev .",
    "the fact that the gut scale particles are involved in the dm decay might be an important hint supporting gut @xcite .",
    "however , since the interaction between the new dm and the sm charged lepton are made extremely weak by introducing superheavy particles mediating the dm decay , it is hard to thermally produce the new dm , and so non - thermal production of dm with a carefully tuned reheating temperature should be necessarily assumed for the required relic density .",
    "one way to avoid it is to consider a susy model with two dm components @xmath14 , where @xmath0 is just the ordinary wimp such as the lsp and @xmath15 indicates a new dm component @xcite :    @xmath16    * @xmath0 : main component of dm explaining the relic density , thermally produced , + @xmath17 absolutely stable . *    * @xmath15 : ( extremely ) small number density , non - thermally produced , + @xmath17 meta - stable , decay to @xmath10 explaining pamela / fermi - lat . *    @xmath16    in this class of models ,",
    "a ( global ) symmetry should be introduced to forbid all unwanted dimension 4 and 5 operators contributing to dm decay .",
    "the required number density of @xmath15 ( @xmath18 ) turns out to be just @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible only if the suppression of the dimension 6 operator is smaller than @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite , since the positron flux in the case of dm decay is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the low energy field spectrum in this class of models  @xcite is the same as that of the mssm except for the neutral singlet extra dm component .",
    "moreover , the models of @xcite can be embedded in the flipped su(5 ) gut .",
    "in the second scenario , we suppose again that just the conventional bino - like lsp is the main component of the dm .",
    "since the `` bino '' is a wimp , thermally produced binos could explain well the relic density of the universe . without introducing a new dm component and interaction , we will attempt to explain the pamela s observation within the framework of the already existing particle physics model , so(10 ) susy gut .      in terms of the sm s quantum numbers , the so(10 ) generator ( @xmath24 ) is split into the generators of the sm gauge group plus @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "we will simply write them as @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the sm gauge group s generators and @xmath30 , @xmath31 compose the generators of su(3)@xmath32su(2)@xmath33su(2)@xmath34u(1)@xmath35 ( @xmath36 lr ) , where @xmath30 and a linear combination of the sm hypercharge generator and @xmath31 ( @xmath37 ) correspond to the su(2)@xmath38 generators .",
    "the other combination orthogonal to it is the u(1)@xmath35 generator ( @xmath39 ) . _",
    "note that @xmath30 and @xmath31 do nt carry color charges .",
    "_ by the vev of the adjoint higgs @xmath40 , the so(10 ) gauge symmetry may break to lr . on the other hand , the sm gauge group s generators and @xmath41 compose the su(5 ) generators .",
    "the vevs of the higgs in the spinorial representations @xmath42 , @xmath43 breaks so(10 ) down to su(5 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath40 and @xmath44 determine the su(5 ) and lr breaking scales , respectively .",
    "non - zero vevs of both @xmath40 and @xmath45 eventually give the sm gauge symmetry at low energies . , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , instead of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath46 break so(10 ) to su(5 ) , while @xmath52 breaks so(10 ) to su(4)@xmath32su(2)@xmath33su(2)@xmath38 . in our discussion throughout this article , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath53 can be replaced by @xmath51 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath52 , respectively . ]",
    "thus , if @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , the gauge bosons and gauginos of @xmath41 achieve heavier ( lighter ) masses than those of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the masses of the gauge sectors for @xmath57 would be given dominantly by the heavier masses in any cases , since both @xmath40 and @xmath58 contribute to their masses .      to achieve the needed extremely small decay rate of the bino - like lsp @xmath0",
    ", we need extremely small r - parity violation _",
    "naturally_. @xmath0 can _ never _ decay , if ( 1 ) r - parity is absolutely preserved _ and _ ( 2 ) @xmath0 is really the lsp .",
    "we mildly relax these two conditions such that @xmath0 _ can _ decay by assuming    * ( 1 ) * a non - zero vev of the superpartner of one family of rh neutrino ,",
    "@xmath59 + @xmath60 ( i.e. r - parity violation ) , _ or _    * ( 2 ) * a mass of @xmath59 lighter than the @xmath0 s mass , @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath59 lsp ) .    by introducing a global symmetry , one can forbid the ( renormalizable ) yukawa couplings between @xmath59 and the mssm fields .",
