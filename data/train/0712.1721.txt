    "supersymmetry is certainly one of the most prominent achievements of the high energy physics . soon after its discovery it was found that in supersymmetric theories the ultraviolet behavior was essentially improved due to some non - renormalization theorems .",
    "for example , there are no divergences in the @xmath2 supersymmetric yang  mills theory , and in theories with @xmath3 supersymmetry divergences are present only in the one - loop approximation .",
    "that is why such models are very attractive from the theoretical point of view .",
    "but , possibly , the most interesting fact is an indirect experimental proof of supersymmetry existence in the standard model .",
    "it was obtained by precise measuring three coupling constants and investigating their evolution by the renormgroup equations .",
    "the result is that only in the supersymmetric version of the standard model the coupling constants coincide at some energy scale , which should follow from grand unification theories .",
    "so , there is no doubt that investigating supersymmetric theories and , in particular , their quantum properties , is very interesting .",
    "dynamics of supersymmetric theories is highly nontrivial .",
    "it is worth mentioning summation of instanton corrections in the @xmath3 supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) or finding a relation between the @xmath2 supersymmetric yang  mills theory and a string theory , compactified on the manifold @xmath4 , known as the ads / cft - correspondence @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider theories with unextended supersymmetry .",
    "such models are especially interesting , because the physics seems to be @xmath0 supersymmetric at energies of the order @xmath5 gev . dynamics of @xmath0 supersymmetric theories also has some interesting features . for example , as a result of investigating instanton contributions structure , in ref .",
    "@xcite form of the @xmath1-function was suggested exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "this @xmath1-function , called the exact novikov  shifman  vainshtein",

    "its numerous verifications by explicit calculations up to the four - loop approximation were made in refs . @xcite .",
    "the authors calculated the @xmath1-function , defined by divergence in the @xmath11-scheme .",
    "the main result is the following : if a subtraction scheme is tuned by a special way , then it is possible to obtain the exact nsvz @xmath1-function .",
    "nevertheless , there is an open question , in which scheme one can obtain this @xmath1-function .",
    "the answer to this question is , in particular , given in this paper .",
    "moreover , we show that there are new identities , relating green functions in some @xmath0 supersymmetric theories , which do not follow from known symmetries of the theory .",
    "possibly , this assumes existence of some new invariances .",
    "note that possibility of their existence was discussed , for example , in finite @xmath0 supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamics of @xmath0 supersymmetric theories is highly nontrivial and deserves further investigation .",
    "an important constituent of this investigation is a regularization @xcite .",
    "the matter is that the dimensional regularization @xcite breaks the supersymmetry and is not convenient for studying supersymmetric theories .",
    "most calculations were made with the dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "it is a modification of the dimensional regularization , which does not break the supersymmetry explicitly . but",
    "this regularization appears to be inconsistent @xcite , and its using can lead to some artifacts .",
    "a consistent regularization , which does not break the supersymmetry , is the higher covariant derivative regularization @xcite . despite of these attractive features",
    ", its using is technically complicated .",
    "that is why before recently this regularization was applied only once , for the one - loop calculation in the ( non - supersymmetric ) yang  mills theory @xcite .",
    "taking into account comments , made in subsequent papers @xcite , the result of the calculation coincided with the the standard expression for the one - loop @xmath1-function ( although in original paper @xcite the authors affirm that it is not so ) .",
    "( for other applications of higher derivatives see , for example , @xcite and the references therein . )    in this paper we will try to demonstrate that using the higher covariant derivative regularization allows revealing some interesting features of the quantum correction structure in @xmath0 supersymmetric theories , which was not known earlier .",

    "[ section_susy ] we recall basic information about the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory , the background field method , and the higher covariant derivative regularization in supersymmetric theories .",

    "[ section_sd ] we try to explain them using the schwinger ",
    "dyson equations and slavnov  taylor identities .",
    "it turns out that in order to explain results of explicit calculation and to obtain the exact nsvz @xmath1-function it is necessary to propose the existence of a new identity for green functions .",

    "in this paper we consider the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with matter fields , which is described in the superspace by the action    @xmath12    here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are chiral matter superfields and @xmath15 is a real scalar superfield , which contains the gauge field @xmath16 as a component .",
    "the superfield @xmath17 is a supersymmetric analogue of the gauge field stress tensor .",
    "it is defined by    @xmath18,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the right and left supersymmetric covariant derivatives respectively . in our notation",
    "the gauge superfield @xmath15 is decomposed with respect to the generators of a gauge group @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a coupling constant .",
    "the generators of the fundamental representation we will denote by @xmath24 .",
    "they are normalized by the condition    @xmath25    action ( [ sym_action ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformations    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is an arbitrary chiral superfield .",
    "such a transformation law means that if the field @xmath13 is in the representation @xmath8 of the gauge group @xmath28 , then the field @xmath14 is in the representation @xmath29 , conjugated to @xmath8 .",
    "note that theory ( [ sym_action ] ) is not the most general renormalizable supersymmetric model . in principle , it is possible to consider a case , in which matter superfields are in an arbitrary representation of a gauge group ( instead of @xmath30 ) , and add terms , cubic in the matter superfields .",
    "however , calculations in model ( [ sym_action ] ) are simpler . that is why here we investigate only such a theory .    for quantization of this model it is convenient to use the background field method .",
    "the matter is that the background field method allows calculating the effective action without manifest breaking of the gauge invariance . in the supersymmetric case",
    "it can formulated as follows @xcite : let us make a substitution    @xmath31    in action ( [ sym_action ] ) , where @xmath32 is a background scalar superfield .",
    "an expression for @xmath33 is a complicated nonlinear function of @xmath15 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we do not interested in explicit form of this function :    @xmath36.\\ ] ]    ( for brevity of notation we do not explicitly write the dependence on @xmath37 here and below . )",
    "the obtained theory will be invariant under the background gauge transformations    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is an arbitrary real superfield .",
    "however , there is one more invariance . in order to construct it ,",
    "we define first the background chiral covariant derivatives    @xmath40    acting on some field @xmath41 , which is transformed as @xmath42 , these covariant derivatives are transformed in the same way .",
    "it is also possible to define a covariant derivative with the lorentz index    @xmath43    which will have the same property .",
    "it is easy to see that the action is also invariant under the quantum transformations    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is an arbitrary background chiral field , which satisfies the condition @xmath46 .",
    "such a superfield can be presented as @xmath47 , where @xmath27 is a usual chiral superfield .",

    "it is convenient to choose a regularization and gauge fixing so that invariance ( [ background_transformations ] ) will be unbroken .",
    "first , we fix a gauge by adding    @xmath50    to the action . in this case",
    "terms quadratic in the superfield @xmath15 will have the simplest form :    @xmath51    the corresponding action for the faddeev ",

    "moreover @xcite , the quantization procedure also requires adding the action for the nielsen  kallosh ghosts    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is an anticommuting chiral superfield , and the background field should be decomposed with respect to the generators of the adjoint representation of a gauge group .",
    "because the fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not interact with the quantum gauge field , they contribute only to the one - loop ( including subtraction ) diagrams .",
    "it is important to note that the factor @xmath59 in action ( [ b_action ] ) is the same as in action for the gauge fixing terms ( [ gauge_fixing ] ) .",
    "the gauge fixing breaks the invariance of the action under quantum gauge transformations ( [ quantum_transformations ] ) , but there is a remaining invariance under brst - transformations .",
    "the brst - invariance leads to slavnov ",
    "taylor identities , which relate vertex functions of the quantum gauge field and ghosts .",
    "for regularization we use the following method : let us add the term    @xmath60    to action ( [ background_action ] ) .",
    "then the invariance under both supersymmetry transformations and transformations ( [ background_transformations ] ) is unbroken .",
    "therefore , the effective action , calculated with the background field method , is invariant under both supersymmetry and background gauge transformations . the described way of regularization is a bit different from the method , proposed in ref .",
    "the difference is in the form of the term , which contains higher covariant derivatives . in the method , considered here ,",
    "it breaks the brst - invariance , but the form of terms , quadratic in the quantum superfield @xmath15 , is simpler .",
    "this simplifies calculations in a certain degree , while all particular features of the higher derivative regularization are the same in the both cases .",
    "however , because the higher derivative term breaks the brst - invariance , it is necessary to use a special subtraction scheme , which cancels noninvariant terms and guarantees fulfilling the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities in each order of the perturbation theory .",
    "such a scheme was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and generalized to the supersymmetric case in refs .",
    "@xcite . with the background field method",
    "such a scheme is simpler , because the background gauge invariance guarantees , for example , the transversality of the two - point green function of the gauge field .",
