    "the coupled - channels approach has been successful in describing the subbarrier enhancement of heavy - ion fusion cross sections  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , it takes into account the coupling between the relative motion of the colliding nuclei and a few low - lying collective excitations in the colliding nuclei , as well as transfer channels , which couple strongly to the ground state .",
    "high - lying modes , such as giant resonances , and single - particle excitations are not considered usually , since the former simply renormalizes the internucleus potential  @xcite and the latter is not coupled strongly to the ground state .",
    "however , in recent years , many experimental data have accumulated that suggest a need to go beyond the conventional coupled - channels approach .",
    "the examples include the surface diffuseness anomaly in the internuclear potential  @xcite , the steep fall - off of fusion cross sections at deep subbarrier energies  @xcite , a large smoothing of quasi - elastic barrier distribution  @xcite , and the energy dependence of the @xmath0-value spectra for quasi - elastic back scattering  @xcite .",
    "it has been a challenge to account for these new aspects of heavy - ion fusion reactions simultaneously with the coupled - channels framework .",
    "recently , quasi - elastic scattering cross sections for @xmath1ne+@xmath2zr systems at backward angles have been measured , which show a considerable difference in the barrier distribution between the two systems  @xcite , that is , the barrier distribution with the @xmath3zr target is much more smeared than that with @xmath4zr .",
    "the coupled - channels calculations , on the other hand , predict a similar barrier distribution to each other for both the systems , because the rotational excitations of @xmath1ne play a predominant role . since those coupled - channels calculations include the collective excitations in the @xmath2zr nuclei ,",
    "the experimental data strongly indicate that the difference in the barrier distribution for the two systems can be attributed to non - collective excitations in the target nuclei .",
    "notice that the effect of single - particle excitation should be more important in @xmath3zr , compared to a @xmath5 magic nucleus , @xmath4zr .    in this contribution",
    ", we shall discuss the effect of single - particle excitations on heavy - ion reactions , that have been ignored in the conventional coupled - channels approach . to this end",
    ", we compute the penetrability for a one dimensional two - level system in the presence of a coupling to dissipative environment described by a random matrix model .",
    "the random matrix model was originally developed by weidenmller and his collaborators in the late 70 s in order to describe deep inelastic collisions for massive systems  @xcite .",
    "here we shall use a similar model , and solve quantum mechanically the coupled - channels equations of a large dimension . see refs .",
    "@xcite for earlier attempts , which however did not use the random matrix model .",
    "in the random matrix model , one considers an ensemble of the coupling matrix elements , @xmath6 , in the coupled - channels equations , which are assumed to follow the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )  @xcite .",
    "that is , they have a zero mean , @xmath7 , and the second moment is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the level density .",
    "we apply this model to a one - dimensional system  @xcite , in which we consider a gaussian potential barrier with the height of 100 mev  @xcite . in order to take into account the quasi - continuum single - particle spectrum ,",
    "we descretize it  @xcite from 3 mev to 13 mev with an energy spacing of 0.05 mev ( in this way , we include 200 single - particle channels ) . in order to take an ensemble average ,",
    "we generate 20 random matrices and perform coupled - channels calculations 20 times for each energy .",
    "in addition to the single - particle levels , we consider also a collective level at 1 mev , whose coupling form factor is given by a gaussian function  @xcite .",
    "the coupling strength to the collective state is set to be the same for all the samples in the random ensemble .",
    "-value distribution defined with the reflected flux .",
    "the peaks at @xmath0=0 and @xmath101 mev correspond to the elastic scattering and the excitation of the collective state , respectively . ]",
    "-value distribution defined with the reflected flux .",
    "the peaks at @xmath0=0 and @xmath101 mev correspond to the elastic scattering and the excitation of the collective state , respectively . ]",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the penetrability thus obtained ( the solid line ) , in comparison to that without the couplings to non - collective states ( the dashed line ) .",
    "the figure also shows by the dotted line the result of a single - channel calculation .",
    "the effect of the non - collective couplings mainly appears at energies above the barrier , where the couplings hinder the penetrability .",
    "the middle panel shows the barrier distribution  @xcite , defined as the first derivative of the penetrability . in the absence of the non - collective couplings , the barrier distribution has two peaks , corresponding to the two eigen - barriers generated from superpositions of the ground and the collective states .",
    "when the non - collective couplings are switched on , the higher peak is smeared significantly , although the structure of the lower peak remains almost the same .",
    "the bottom panel shows the logarithmic slope of the penetrability  @xcite , which provides a useful means to investigate the deep subbarrier behavior of the penetrability .",
    "one can see that the logarithmic slope is not altered much by the non - collective couplings , indicating that the steep fall - off phenomena of deep subbarrier fusion cross sections do not seem to be accounted for by the present mechanism ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0-value distribution obtained with the reflected flux in the solution of coupled - channels equations .",
    "we have smeared the discrete distribution with a lorenzian function with the width of 0.2 mev . at energies below the barrier , only the elastic and the collective channels are important . as energy increases , one can clearly see that the single - particle excitations gradually become important , in accordance with the results shown in fig",
    "one can also define the @xmath0-value distribution with the transmitted flux ( not shown ) .",
    "our calculation indicates that the @xmath0-value distribution obtained with the transmitted flux is much less sensitive to the non - collective couplings compared with the @xmath0-value distribution defined with the reflected flux , suggesting that quasi - elastic scattering is more sensitive to the single - particle excitations than fusion .",
    "we have applied the random matrix model to a one - dimensional barrier penetrability in order to discuss the effect of single - particle excitations .",
    "we have shown that the effects of non - collective excitations mainly affect the above barrier behavior of the penetrability , that is , they hinder the penetrability and smear the barrier distribution . on the other hand , the low energy behavior does not appear significant .",
    "the coupled - channels approach with the random matrix model enables one to compute the @xmath0-value distribution .",
    "we have shown that the single - particle excitation gradually becomes important as energy increases .    in this contribution , we have used a schematic one - dimensional model .",
    "it will be an interesting future project to apply this model to realistic systems , and investigate the effect of non - collective excitations on quasi - elastic barrier distributions .",
    "a quantum mechanical description of deep inelastic collisions using the present model will also be of interest .",
