    "the interplay between pbhs as a source of cdm affecting cosmological dynamics , and their evaporation as a source of entropy and particles @xcite affecting nucleosynthesis and cmb observations leads to constraints on their mass spectrum over a wide mass range @xcite .",
    "since black hole evaporation manifestly violates t - invariance , cp must be violated as well so that baryon number is not conserved @xcite , which led to the suggestion , in the context of guts , that the baryon asymetry of the universe could be thereby explained @xcite . in the context of inflationary models",
    ", pbh formation can be triggered by large amplitude inhomogeneities caused by bubble nucleation over scales comparable to the horizon , which can collapse into black holes at the end of an extended inflationary period @xcite .",
    "the evaporation of pbhs with mass less than @xmath1 g , on timescales less than a hubble time @xcite , can lead either to complete evaporation , or may stop at a planck scale mass @xmath2 g @xcite .",
    "much work has been done since then on the possibility of pbh formation at phase transitions , on the dynamics of their collapse and on their possible role in large scale structure formation , e.g. @xcite and references therein .    in what follows ,",
    "we concentrate on the potential of pbhs formed at the end of extended inflation in providing a mechanism for the production of the current observed entropy per baryon , the inferred dark matter density , and as a possible source for the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "we emphasize a remarkable triple coincidence for the conditions required to produce these three quantities , pointing towards a well defined epoch for pbh formation around @xmath0 , which can be identified with the end of inflation .    in this model ,",
    "the absolute entropy of the universe is given by the entropy of a gas of standard model particles at the initial temperature @xmath3 , produced by pbhs created at @xmath0 which evaporate at @xmath4 , identified with the reheating time .",
    "this same pbh evaporation leads also to a dark matter component , assumed to consist of approximately planck mass remnants with a mass density approximately equal to the pbh density times the planck mass .",
    "the net baryon density and asymmetry is also related to the pbh evaporation , through sphaleron processes in a domain wall structure surrounding the pbhs .",
    "the presently observed entropy , dark matter density and net baryon to entropy ratio are obtained for a unique value of the reheating time @xmath4 , which coincides with the electroweak timescale , and which defines a unique time for the end of inflation at @xmath5 .",
    "at the planck time @xmath6 s the planck mass @xmath7 , corresponding to the planck energy @xmath8 , is within a particle horizon whose size is the planck length @xmath9 cm .",
    "any pbhs formed before or during inflation would have had their energy density diluted by the exponential expansion of the scale factor to a negligible value , so that pbh formation is of interest mainly after the end of inflation , at @xmath10 .",
    "the difficulties of the original inflation model are resolved most simply in models of extended or hyperextended inflation @xcite , which is generally taken to end around an epoch @xmath11 s , at which time the energy scale has dropped to @xmath12 gev . at this time the universe is cold , due to adiabatic cooling during the expansion of the scale factor by sixty or more e - foldings , so the pressure is essentially zero , and the equation of state is correspondingly soft .",
    "primordial energy density fluctuations coming into the horizon at @xmath13 may be of the canonical inflationary ( harrison - zeldovich ) type , with relative amplitudes @xmath14 , and/or may be large amplitude fluctuations caused by chaotic conditions associated with bubble nucleation at @xmath15 , where one may expect @xmath16 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the latter fluctuations can cause pbhs to form almost immediately at @xmath17 , with a mass @xmath18 which is a fraction @xmath19 of the mass in the horizon @xmath20 at that time , ( t_1 ) ( t_1/ ) 10 ^ 6.6 t_1,-32  [ eq : mbh ] or @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",

    "thus even if the perturbations coming into the horizon at the end of inflation had only the canonical amplitude @xmath26 , they grow with the scale factor of the universe @xmath27 as @xmath28 ( for a matter dominated [ md ] universe , if the equation of state is cold ) .",

    "the evaporation timescale ( [ eq : tbh ] ) remains approximately the same even if mass loss stops after the pbh has shrunk down to a planck mass @xmath63 g , since by this time it will have radiated away most of its energy in the form of photons and particles .",

    "these would behave as non - relativistic matter , and in order not to exceed limits on the current dark matter density , they imply constraints on the epoch at which they evaporated , and therefore also on the epoch at which they formed @xcite . at the epoch @xmath31 when they evaporate , if each pbh leaves a relic of mass @xmath65 , the relic matter density @xmath66 is _",

    "the latter could be in the form of stable planck mass relics , or possibly stable , weakly interacting decay products of such relics , with the same total mass .",

    "this range is mostly unconstrained by current observational restrictions on pbh mass spectra @xcite .",

    "it is generally thought that the baryon asymmetry must have been generated by the epoch at which the universe cooled below the electroweak energy scale @xmath74 @xcite . this corresponds , extrapolating back from the present epoch , to a scale factor @xmath75 and an epoch @xmath76 .",

    "the coincidence between the pbh evaporation timescale @xmath31 and the electroweak timescale @xmath77 is remarkable .",
    "the first is derived from a requirement to explain the reheating and the observed entropy / dm ratio starting from an inflationary early universe scenario , while the second is determined from a particle physics energy scale and the more recent dynamics of the universe .",
    "the fact that the universe is baryon asymmetric provides , in fact , an additional constraint on the epoch @xmath31 at which pbhs evaporate , if the baryon asymmetry arises from baryonic decay products of pbh evaporation , which is manifestly cp - violating process .",
    "the requirement that any net baryon number @xmath81 produced in pbh evaporation should not be washed out by cp - violating currents expected at the electroweak transition epoch @xmath77 imposes the requirement @xmath82 .",
    "this additional requirement is in fact satisfied by the entropy to dark matter constraint ( [ eq : massratioteq ] ) , requiring @xmath78 , which in turn constrains , through equation ( [ eq : mbh],[eq : tbh ] ) , the horizon entrance time of the pbh perturbations to be @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , in order for the energy density of these pbhs not to be diluted to a negligible value , they must be born after the end of inflation , @xmath84 .",
    "the double constraint on @xmath85 from the reheating / entropy / dm requirement on the one hand , and on @xmath86 to preserve any baryon asymmetry on the other hand , in turn constrains the end of inflation to occur at @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , either one of the previous two constraints acting individually ( as long as pbhs are responsible either for the entropy / dark matter ratio or the baryon asymmetry ) is enough to require @xmath88 . the fact that both independent constraints acting simultaneously require the same value of @xmath15 is again remarkable .",
    "the baryogenesis mechanism of @xcite included mechanisms occurring at gut temperatures , assuming that pbhs with @xmath89 radiate bosons which decay into a net baryon number .",
    "( a different pbh baryogenesis mechanism in ekpyrotic / cyclic models @xcite has been discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "however , any gut scale baryon asymmetry can be washed out by sphaleron processes during during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "sphalerons are non - trivial topological field configurations which generate a net @xmath90 number .",

    "n_f[y_cs(a_su(2 ) ) + y_cs(a_u(1)_y ) ] [ eq : lagrangian ] where in general @xmath96 , and substituting from eq ( [ eq : anomaly ] ) we get _ ind _",
    "j^ however the coincidence of pbh formation during and before the electroweak phase transition temperature gives us a clue as to the origin of this field @xmath97 .",
    "if the field @xmath97 is associated with the phase of the higgs field we may be able to naturally generate the baryon asymmetry . indeed such a mechanism was made concrete by nagatani @xcite . in this mechanism",
    "the higgs field forms a spherical domain wall around the pbh due to spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the gradient in the domain wall is the cp violating phase which also acts as the chemical potential to generate the net baryon asymmetry due to sphaleron processes .",
    "the domain wall configuration is expressed as : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the local temperature measured at a radius @xmath101 from the black hole center .",
    "this temperature gradient is determined by the radiation energy density gradient produced by the radiation outflow from the black hole .    in this configuration of the higgs vacuum expectation value ,",
    "the width of the domain wall @xmath102 is equal to the depth of the symmetric region .",
    "the hawking radiation ( particles ) emanating from the black hole traverse this domain wall , and the energy gradient in the wall induces a shpaleron transition which creates a net baryon number from the hawking radiation .",
    "the net baryon number @xmath103 resulting from this process can be calculated directly@xcite , and for pbh temperatures @xmath104 the resulting net baryon number , and the ratio of the net baryon to entropy ( where the latter is as calculated in the previous section ) is @xmath105 , satisfying the bbn constraints .",
    "remarkably , as shown in the previous two sections , this temperature is essentially the same temperature ( [ eq : tbh ] ) corresponding to pbhs formed at @xmath106 and evaporating at @xmath107 , which can produce both the observed entropy and the observed dark matter density .",
    "these same pbhs can therefore also produce the right net baryon number and the entropy per baryon of the universe .",
    "the possibility that three major observational parameters of the universe , namely the entropy density , the dark matter density and the net baryon to entropy ratio , may be simultaneously explained by a single mechanism is remarkable . in this scenario",
    "the reheating and the entropy is produced by the evaporation of promordial black holes .",
    "if , as has been widely surmised , these leave relics whose mass is of order the planck mass per evaporating black hole , these can provide the dark matter density . for one or both of the above to come out right",
    ", the pbh mass must be in the ton range ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "a newer element , in addition to the above , is that the difference between the pbh temperature and the temperature of the universe provides a temperature gradient , through which evaporating particles can undergo cp - violating transitions leading to a net baryon number",
    ". a specific pbh evaporation domain wall mechanism can give the observed net baryon number and baryon to entropy ratio , in agreement with bbn constraints , when the pbh temperature is in the pev range , corresponding again to the ton mass range .",
    "the entropy , by itself , could in principle be produced by a range of pbh collapse times @xmath109 .",
    "however , the additional requirement of relating also the dark matter density , the net baryon number , or both , to the evaporation process narrows the pbh formation time to the epoch @xmath73 .",
    "since pbhs with a significant energy density must arise at or after this epoch , this can be identified with the end of inflation .",
    "this same epoch occurrs independently in hyperextended models of inflation where the non - minimal coupling is something other than quadratic in the scalar field , leading also to a prediction @xcite of a gravitational wave background .",
    "the pbh formation epoch @xmath110 also determines the reheating temperature @xmath111 , caused by the pbh evaporation at the epoch @xmath112 .",
    "the triple coincidence discussed here , based on the physics of pbh evaporation , provides a strong incentive for identifying pbhs as responsible for three of the key parameters of cosmological models , namely the current entropy , the dark matter , and the net baryon asymmetry with the right baryon to entropy ratio .",
    "it also provides an upper limit for the end of inflation at the epoch @xmath71 .",
