    "a first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) in which two differentiated phases briefly coexisted could be the setting for the genesis of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) , and may have left signatures , like a gravitational wave background or primordial magnetic fields , which we might be able to observe in relatively short order @xcite .",
    "such a transition may satisfy andrei sakharov s three conditions for electroweak baryogenesis @xcite : cp violation , baryon number violation , and deviation from thermal equilibrium , the latter imposed by the expanding bubbles of the broken symmetry phase on the whole of the medium at one point or another until the time when the whole universe has crossed over to the new phase and the transition ends .",
    "a first - order ewpt requires the presence of two stable or metastable phases which correspond to extrema in the high - temperature expansion of the higgs thermal effective potential ( figure [ fig : effectivepotential ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the observed baryon asymmetry could not have been produced in such a scenario within the standard model ( sm ) unless the higgs mass were far lower than allowed by present experimental bounds and @xmath2 gev when the discovery of a previously unknown boson , consistent with the higgs and with a mass of @xmath3 gev , was announced in july 2012 @xcite ] .",
    "this is because sphaleron transitions must be sufficiently suppressed inside the bubbles of the new phase to avoid washout of the newly - created baryon asymmetry @xcite . also , the electroweak phase transition is not even first - order in the standard model except ( again ) for higgs masses far below present experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "simple extensions of the standard model , however , are still capable of producing a sufficiently high baryon asymmetry through a first - order ewpt for presently acceptable values of the higgs mass @xmath4 , be it via extra higgs fields @xcite , light top squarks @xcite , singlets @xcite or non - standard higgs potentials @xcite . below we will consider the latter possibility .    calculations of the dynamical characteristics of a first - order phase transition ( like the expansion velocity of the walls of bubbles of the new phase after nucleation ) mostly rely on solving the relevant hydrodynamical equations , modelling the radiation - dominated early universe as a perfect relativistic fluid @xcite . usually , the wkb ( semiclassical ) approximation is adopted .",
    "this assumes that the de broglie wavelength of the particles in the plasma is considerably smaller than the width of the bubble wall , which should be true for all particles in most situations except possibly for very infrared bosons , which are assumed to have little influence on the wall dynamics @xcite .",
    "such treatments derive a fluid equation which describes the dynamics of the variables characterising the cosmic fluid ( fluid velocity , temperature , and higgs vacuum expectation value ) .",
    "the fluid equation includes a _ friction term _ which tends to slow down the propagation of the bubble wall . in some treatments a phenomenological parameter which characterises the medium",
    "is introduced into such a term @xcite . in others",
    "an explicit calculation of the friction from the modelling of the plasma is carried out @xcite .",
    "friction is a function of the deviation from thermal equilibrium of the particle components of the plasma which couple strongly to the background higgs field .",
    "if local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) were maintained throughout the plasma there would be no friction and the expanding bubble walls would accelerate to the speed of light @xcite .",
    "the presence of friction may lead to two outcomes : either the advancing bubble wall reaches a steady state under the influence of friction and propagates with constant velocity , or friction is too weak and the wall accelerates without bound towards ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "the feasibility of such runaway walls has recently been proven theoretically @xcite .    in the following we lay out a general approach to bubble velocities , based on an efficient parametrization of friction exerted by the plasma on the bubble wall . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have used this framework for the first time to compute the wall velocity in the mssm for realistic higgs masses , requiring use of the 2-loop thermal higgs potential .",
    "here we take the example of the dimension-6 extension of the standard model with a cut - off @xmath5 , discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , to demonstrate the power of our approach to bubble velocities .",
    "this extension if the sm provides also new sources of cp - violation necessary to obtain realistic values of the baryon asymmetry within the model parameters @xcite and results in a phase transition strong enough to avoid washout .",
    "we apply the semiclassical , perfect - fluid approximation to the electroweak plasma with our extended thermal potential .",
    "we adapt standard hydrodynamical calculations to our model which employ a phenomenological friction parameter . in order to calibrate this parameter realistically for our model",
    "we base ourselves on existing results for the wall velocity within the standard model and the description of the evolution of particle populations through boltzmann evolution equations in the form known as the relaxation time approximation @xcite .",
    "we compare the calibration from standard model results with that found through the theoretical criterion for runaway walls mentioned above .",
    "thus we predict values of the friction parameter with which the steady - state expansion velocity of the bubble walls may be calculated for a range of the model parameters @xmath5 , @xmath4 .",
    "we find the wall velocity to be often subsonic ( lower than the speed of sound in the medium ) , similar to existing results for the minimal sm .",
    "for relatively low values of the higgs mass and the dimension-6 cutoff scale @xmath5 , however , the phase transition becomes very strong and the steady - state wall velocity may shift into the supersonic regime . eventually we predict runaway , rather than steady - state , behaviour for the highest values of the strength of the phase transition within our parameter space .",
    "we comment briefly on the possibility of hybrid steady - state solutions in the frontier between the subsonic and supersonic regimes , as well as on the existing criteria for stability of the growing bubbles as they apply to our model .",
    "lastly , we provide a user - friendly description of our friction parameter calibration , based on the relaxation time approximation , for use in any model given a reference calibration point for the friction . the results presented here can directly be used to treat cases with sm - like friction , e.g.  susy scenarios without light stops , as for instance can be realised in singlet extensions of the mssm .",
    "the fundamental tool employed to study the electroweak phase transition is the finite - temperature effective potential for the background higgs vev @xmath6 , @xmath7 , representing the free energy per unit volume of the field configuration ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . at high temperature , the thermal potential has only one local minimum ( figure [ fig : effectivepotential ] ) at @xmath8 , representing the unbroken symmetry phase of the theory and the state of the universe before the phase transition .",
    "as temperature decreases a second local minimum of the potential appears for a @xmath9 , corresponding to the broken symmetry phase of the theory .",
    "as at first @xmath10 the broken symmetry phase is energetically disfavoured and the phase transition may not yet proceed .",
    "as temperature decreases further , @xmath11 also decreases until it becomes degenerate with the @xmath12-vev minimum at the _ critical temperature _ @xmath13 . from that point on configurations ( bubbles ) of the new phase may , in principle , form and the transition may take place .",

    "the second term represents the negative contribution from the value of the higgs potential in the interior volume of the bubble . assuming spherically symmetric bubbles , for each temperature there exists a _",
    "critical radius _ such that nucleated bubbles larger than the critical size will expand spontaneously ( thus minimising their free energy ) whereas smaller than critical bubbles will collapse under surface tension .",
    "the critical radius is infinite at @xmath13 and decreases monotonically with temperature .",
    "the critical bubble is a _",

    "the equation of motion for the background higgs field ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is a function of the phase space population density functions @xmath44 for all the particles present in the plasma , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the renormalised vacuum potential and the sum is over massive degrees of freedom so that , for the appropriate couplings , e.g.  @xmath47 for fermions , @xmath48 for bosons .",
    "the population densities can be expressed as a thermal equilibrium part plus a deviation , @xmath49 , with the equilibrium distribution for fermions / bosons , in the rest frame of the plasma , given by @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 ) .",
    "the derivative of the vacuum potential combines with the integral of the equilibrium part of the distributions to give the finite - temperature effective potential @xmath52 .",
    "the equation of motion then becomes @xmath53 the @xmath54-dependent term is the friction term .",
    "thus , as stated earlier , friction effects are the result of the deviation of the particle populations in the plasma from equilibrium",

    "the authors of e.g.  @xcite assume @xmath85 for the wall thickness @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 .",
    "this is a natural assumption if the bubble wall is expected to be relatively _ slow _ since slower walls are thicker and not as sharp ( quantities vary more slowly across the wall ) and relativistic time dilation is not a factor in increasing the characteristic timescale for particle interaction ( the relaxation time ) . in this approximation",
    "we drop the derivative term in ( [ eq : boltzboosted ] ) and obtain ( for one degree of freedom ) , @xmath88 inserting this form for @xmath54 into the friction term in the equation of motion for the background higgs field ( [ eq : eommp4 ] ) we obtain @xmath89 which gives an equation of motion for a slow wall , in the rest frame of the advancing wall , of the form @xmath90 the pressure difference felt by the advancing wall ( for one degree of freedom ) in this approximation is @xmath91    the opposite limit is that of a fast , relativistic wall .",
    "this will naturally be a thin , sharp wall and relativistic time dilation will lenghten the characteristic relaxation time for particle populations .",

    ", the bubble profile becomes a _ similarity solution _ to the equations , expanding linearly with time but maintaining its relative shape .",
    "the medium is assumed to be at rest both far ahead of and far behind the advancing bubble wall .",
    "this assumption dictates that no single , planar front may satisfy the stress - energy conservation equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "two possibilities are usually assumed to exist depending on whether the bubble wall advances at a velocity larger or smaller than the speed of sound in the medium @xmath100 : the first case is generally known as a _ detonation _ , the second as a _ deflagration_. in a detonation no information propagates ahead of the moving wall , which hits the medium while it is still at rest .",
    "the medium is heated up and accelerated by the bubble wall , then cools down and comes to rest in a _ rarefaction wave _ while already in the broken symmetry phase behind the wall . in a deflagration , a _ shock front _ propagates at or close to the speed of sound ahead of the bubble wall .",
    "it heats up and accelerates the fluid in the symmetric phase before the phase transition front proper brings it back to rest .",
    "the common assumption of modelling the phase transition front and the shock front ( where it exists ) as planar surfaces leads to constant values of the dynamic variables ( fluid velocity and temperature ) in the regions away from the fronts , including that between the phase transition front and the shock front in a deflagration .",
    "we will refine our calculation ( for a deflagration ) by splitting the bubble profile into three regions and writing the conservation equations separately for each .",
    "we adopt the planar approach to integrate the conservation equations across the bubble wall that separates the symmetric and broken phases , and across the shock front that propagates ahead of the wall .",
    "however ( as in e.g.",
    "@xcite ) we will take into account the sphericity of the bubble to calculate the evolution of the dynamic variables in the region between the fronts . in this way we may produce a whole profile of the bubble .",
    "we match our results to what we take to be the temperature of the universe outside the bubble ( ahead of the shock front for a deflagration , or the bubble wall for a detonation ) .",
    "we carry out the hydrodynamical calculations for steady - state solutions .",
    "finally , we investigate the possibility of runaway walls .      a more careful analysis ( see e.g.  @xcite ) reveals the possibility of so - called _ hybrid _ steady - state solutions in between detonations and deflagrations .",
    "hybrid solutions have both a shock front propagating ahead of the phase transition front proper _ and _ a rarefaction wave following the phase transition front . for a given physical situation",
    "they appear naturally with increasing steady - state wall velocity ( arising with decreasing friction ) . a subsonic wall , as mentioned , propagates as a deflagration .",
    "if the wall becomes supersonic , however , it does not instantly become a detonation .",
    "instead , a rarefaction wave appears behind the wall while a supersonic shock front still propagates ahead of the phase transition front .",
    "if the steady - state wall velocity becomes even larger , it eventually catches up with the shock front , which disappears , the solution becoming a pure detonation .",
    "in this work we do not concern ourselves with the dynamics of a rarefaction wave and therefore do not study in any detail the possibility of hybrid solutions .",
    "however , as noted below , our results are consistent with the appearance of hybrid solutions within the parameter space or our model .",
    "it has recently been established that the friction , which slows down the wall due to interactions between the wall and the particles in the plasma ( and which exactly balances out with the pressure difference for a steady - state wall , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure ] ) ) reaches a _ finite limit _ as @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of runaway walls if the pressure difference is higher than this limit to the friction . in the ultrarelativistic limit",
    "both our slow wall and fast wall limits to the friction integral ( equal to the steady - state pressure difference ) converge to the same integral dependence as @xmath95 which tends indeed to a finite limit with @xmath102 approaching @xmath103 .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the slow wall limit of the friction integral contains the relaxation time @xmath82 which should not remain constant but grow as @xmath101 . assuming a dependence @xmath104 with @xmath105 constant the friction in this limit diverges as @xmath106 .",
    "no such divergence occurs in the fast wall limit .",
    "we assume therefore that our description is adequate in each limit .",
    "we will use this fact to link the relaxation time approximation with the hydrodynamical calculation of the wall velocity and produce a usable model for the friction in section 4 .",
    "we essentially follow the same strategy as in @xcite , originally adapted from @xcite .",
    "we derive our hydrodynamical equations from the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the system consists of that of the electroweak plasma ( modelled as a perfect relativistic fluid ) plus that of the background higgs field ,    @xmath107    as the equation of state for the system we adopt @xmath108 with the radiation pressure @xmath109 , @xmath110 being the number of effective degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we employ the usual thermodynamic relations    @xmath111    @xmath40 denoting the _ free energy per unit volume_. with these the total energy - momentum tensor may be expressed as    @xmath112    where the _ radiative enthalpy _",
    "is @xmath113 .",
    "even though this is conserved as a whole ( @xmath114 ) , the fluid and field components are not :    @xmath115 .",
    "we now split the conservation equations into two parts ( as in @xcite ) , making each part equal to plus or minus an appropriately chosen friction term which we choose to make dependent on a dimensionless _",
    "friction parameter_. our original choice ( later reconsidered , see [ subsec : frparandvw ] ) was inspired by the form of the equation of motion for the higgs vev in the slow wall limit of the relaxation time approximation ( [ eq : eomsw ] ) , given the fermionic and bosonic mass dependence on the higgs vev .",
    "the conservation equations ( in covariant form ) may be split as    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the part of the higgs effective potential dependent only on the higgs vev while @xmath118 is the part dependent also on temperature .",

    "note that the same reasoning that took us to ( [ eq : pressure ] ) , if applied to ( [ eqn : fluid1 ] ) , leads to a pressure difference _ divergent _ as @xmath149 because of the @xmath106 factor present .",
    "this may not be very important if the bubble wall is very subsonic ( as it is in supersymmetric light stop scenario @xcite ) but for fast walls ( or in order to investigate the possibility of runaway ) this difficulty can not be ignored .",
    "we are therefore forced to consider a more complex relationship between the friction parameter and the wall velocity .",
    "the simplest assumption that we can make is that the friction parameter depends on @xmath102 as @xmath150 , with @xmath151 constant and @xmath152 , so that the @xmath106 factor in ( [ eqn : fluid1 ] ) is effectively not there .",
    "this is the assumption we shall make in our calculations .",
    "we wish to produce a reliable estimate for the friction parameter in ( [ eqn : fluid1 ] ) in order to solve for the bubble profile and calculate the wall velocity for our model .",
    "the form of the friction parameter supplied by the relaxation time approximation in its slow wall limit can be written in analogy to ( [ eqn : fluid1 ] ) through the relevant mass couplings , @xmath153 for one degree of freedom . in the last step we assumed that @xmath154 is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant prefactors coming from @xmath82 and the mass couplings depend on the model considered . rather than carrying out a first - principles calculation ,",
    "our _ goal _ is to develop a technique to relate the existing results from @xcite ( arrived at using the full form of the collision integral ) to any standard model - like situation ( in which friction is carried by the top and weak gauge boson degrees of freedom ) .",
    "a similar analysis for the case of friction dominated by light stops was carried out in @xcite .",
    "note that we are free to change integration variables in ( [ eq : reltfrterm1 ] ) from @xmath155 .",
    "since @xmath156 the friction term suggested by the relaxation time approximation in this form becomes @xmath157    given the general dependence of the mass the integral contains factors of @xmath158 .",
    "this strongly suggests that friction is dependent on the strength of the phase transition , commonly expressed in the literature by the parameter @xmath159 , that is , @xmath160 evaluated at the critical temperature .",
    "if we wish to approximate the friction integral by a single numerical contribution ( from each degree of freedom ) , one way would be to approximate the @xmath158 factors by @xmath161 ( or an appropriate related value like @xmath162 @xmath161 , the value of @xmath158 roughly half way across the wall at @xmath13 ) and integrate over momentum ) or broken symmetry phase ( @xmath163 ) temperatures . ] .",
    "alternatively , one can plot the spatial dependence of the friction term itself ( peaked because of the @xmath164 factor , which goes to zero away from the bubble wall on either side ) and replace the integral by a constant which equalises the peaks ( figure [ fig : frictermfitted ] ) .",
    "this can be done , for example , through the 2-parameter hyperbolic tangent ansatz commonly used to approximate the shape of the wall ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the variation of the higgs vev across the bubble wall ( assumed planar ) is given in this approximation by ( fig [ fig : tanhansatz ] ) @xmath165 where @xmath86 is the wall thickness and @xmath166 the value of the higgs vev in the broken     ( solid line ) , and the same term with the momentum integral replaced by a fitted constant ( dotted line ) , @xmath167 , for fermions ( left ) and bosons ( right ) in an example case .",

    "symmetry phase behind the bubble wall as read from the effective potential . as the ansatz is written in the rest frame of the advancing steady - state bubble wall",
    "there is no time dependence .",
    "a quick way to obtain a usable value for @xmath86 is through @xmath174 with @xmath175 the height of the potential barrier between the two minima of the effective potential ( this is suggested by the simplified 2-parameter scalar potential @xmath176 with the equation of motion @xmath177 , into which the hyperbolic tangent ansatz may be substituted ) .    using either of these approaches , or a comparable simplification ,",
    "the relaxation time approximation model supplies a numerical coefficient for a description of the friction of the form @xmath178 . because we assume that @xmath151 has no dependence on @xmath102 we set @xmath179 in the momentum integral in ( [ eq : mominteta ] ) .",
    "as mentioned , the prefactors for the friction integral for each massive degree of freedom in the plasma that couples strongly to the higgs can be calibrated from existing results , in our case those for the standard model in @xcite .",
    "this is because friction processes are a function of the particle content of the model and the relevant particle interactions , and therefore , as long as we remain within a standard model - like situation , the prefactors to the momentum integrals ( the relevant coupling constants and the chosen form for the relaxation time approximation ) should hold .",
