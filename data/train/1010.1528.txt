    "the discovery of accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsars ( amxp ) @xcite supports the recycling scenario @xcite according to which millisecond radio pulsars @xcite are descendants of low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "all of the 13 amxps known to date are x - ray transients . during an outburst",
    "the luminosity of these objects can change two orders of magnitude . according to the conventional picture classifying neutron stars in terms of their interaction with the surrounding matter , as the mass flow rate @xmath0 declines throughout the outburst",
    ", these objects should undergo a transition to the propeller stage @xcite in which the centrifugal barrier inhibits inflowing matter in the disk to reach the surface of the neutron star . around this transition",
    "the torque should also change sign so that the star spins down .",
    "accretion onto amxps even at low accretion rates is a challenge to this picture . in some cases ,",
    "even while the the neutron stars exhibit a high rate of spin - down , accretion onto the neutron star continues , and the x - ray pulsations prevail . in order to explain these difficulties rappaport et al .",
    "@xcite has presented a steady state solution of the disk structure in which the inner radius of the disk remains on the co - rotation radius while @xmath0 declines .",
    "sax j1808.4 - 3658 experiences outbursts lasting a few weeks roughly once in two years , during which the coherent @xmath1 hz pulsations are observable . the inner radius of the accretion disk , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the magnetic moment , @xmath4 is the mass of the neutron star and @xmath5 is a factor of unity , is expected to increase with dropping @xmath0 .",
    "there is recent evidence @xcite that the @xmath6 _ does _ recede during the decline of the outburst .",
    "an _ infinitely thin _",
    "disk can not accrete matter as soon as @xmath6 moves beyond the co - rotation radius @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angular frequency of the neutron star . in this case",
    "the fastness parameter @xmath9 becomes greater than unity .",
    "the luminosity is expected to drop to zero abruptly .",
    "the situation can be different for a disk with a _",
    "finite _ thickness which will be able to accrete matter even for @xmath10 because the part of the disk at high latitudes will not be centrifugally inhibited .",
    "inclination between the rotation axis and the magnetic axis will further facilitate accretion .    here ,",
    "we reassess the work of @xcite for estimating the fraction of mass that can accrete in the spin down regime and apply it to model the lightcurve of sax j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "the fraction of matter that can accrete onto a neutron star in the spin - down regime was first estimated by lipunov & shakura @xcite for spherical accretion . here",

    "the co - rotation surface is defined as @xmath13 . a disk with a _",
    "finite _ thickness will be able to accrete matter even when @xmath14 because at high latitudes ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 can be satisfied . the fraction of the inflowing matter that can accrete onto the neutron star is @xmath17 here the critical angle @xmath18 is defined through @xmath19 . given the uncertainty of the size of the magnetosphere in the presence of plasma , we follow @xcite and assume that @xmath20 which gives @xmath21 . using @xmath22 and @xmath23 from the quasi - spherical solutions of @xcite , one obtains @xmath24 note that this result follows from the work of @xcite , the only difference being that these authors , at the final step , used the small angle approximation ( i.e. @xmath25 ) and so found @xmath26 which is @xmath27 limit of the above .",
    "the thick inner region of the disk will match to a standard thin disk @xcite outside .",

    "according to this solution @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass flow rate at the beginning of the outburst , @xmath33 is the viscous time - scale in the outer disk , and @xmath34 depends on the opacity and pressure regime prevailing in the disk . for an electron scattering and gas pressure dominated disk @xmath35",

    "the slow decay region can be modeled by using @xmath43 days , @xmath44 g s@xmath45 and @xmath35 in eqn.([inflow ] ) assuming all matter can acccrete .",
    "we associate the commence of the rapid decay with @xmath46 which allows for determining the magnetic moment of the star as @xmath47 g @xmath48 . for @xmath49",

    "we find that the rapid decay stage can be modeled as fractional accretion in the fast ( @xmath51 ) regime .    because of",

    "this can be done by solving eqn .",

    "the rapid decay stage is followed by a flaring decay stage ( see the figure 1 in @xcite ) which is not addressed in this work .",
    "we have suggested that the rapid decay stage of the lightcurve of sax j1808.43658 during an outburst can be modeled by fractional accretion in the rapidly rotating stage ( @xmath51 ) .",
