    "for each available year ( that ranges , in the us social security administration ( ssa ) archives @xcite , from 1910 to 2012 ) we study how names given in a state @xmath0 are correlated to names given in a state @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of these names have already been analized @xcite and it is further described in the supplementary information .",
    "for each pair of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath2 ( the federal district of washington d.c . is considered by itself ) we compute a correlation coefficient @xmath3 , computed as follow .",
    "let us consider a generic year @xmath4 and let @xmath5 be the number of girls named @xmath6 born in the state @xmath7 in the year @xmath4 ( we limit ourself to describe the girls case as we have verified that analysing baby boys names leads to the same conclusions ) . in each year , we have a @xmath8 rectangular matrix , whose entries @xmath5 are the occurrences of the baby girl names , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the number of different girl names , and @xmath12 the number of states . if the name @xmath6 appears less than 5 times in the state @xmath7 in the year @xmath4 , then @xmath5 , because the information provided by ssa does not include names that occur less than 5 times .",
    "these matrices are sparse , and only an average of @xmath13 of the entries are different from zero .",
    "the frequency @xmath14 of the name @xmath6 in the state @xmath7 is given by @xmath15 the average frequency of the name @xmath6 over the states is @xmath16 where @xmath12 is the total number of states .",
    "we can define the quantities @xmath17 which take into account fluctuations of the frequencies of the names over the states .",
    "the average of @xmath18 over all the names is zero in each state @xmath7 , as can be explicitly seen from their definition : @xmath19 given that in each state @xmath7 , @xmath20 . in order to compute how the names in the state @xmath0 are correlated with the names in the state @xmath1 , we computed , year after year , the pearson correlation between the variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which is the @xmath23 square matrix @xmath24 this matrix can be used to capture the emergence of complex correlations between clusters of states and to study their evolution in time . however , separating the real information from the noise is a non - trivial problem .",
    "similar issues have already been faced in biological problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in financial stock - markets @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as well as in internet traffic analysis @xcite and in the statistics of atmospheric correlations @xcite .",
    "the main point is that even though the empirical correlation matrix is noisy it does have stable properties .",
    "we checked these properties , such as the eigenvalue spectrum and eigenvector localization , and compared them with a null hypothesis , i.e. random matrix properties , to identify the stable , non solely random , data correlations in a given period .    here",
    "we apply two general method for the analysis of correlation matrices , i.e. principal component analysis ( pca ) and hierarchical clustering .",
    "pca consists in selecting the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the cross - correlation matrix .",
    "this relies on the hypothesis that smaller eigenvalues are related to noise while larger ones are more related to the system dynamics .",
    "hierarchical clustering , on the other hand , starts from @xmath25 clusters formed of one state each and allows to set up a hierarchy of clusters by merging clusters according to their distances , that can be defined in several way from the correlations .",
    "both these widely known methods shows the same results that are stable in sexes , i.e. hold both for male and female names , year after year and for different metrics in the hierarchical clustering algorithm .",
    "these methods are further described in the supplementary material .",
    "we obtain a clear division of states in homogeneous groups .",
    "a group of states is qualitatively defined as states that share a certain similarity in their distributions of names .",
    "it is natural to associate them to a common cultural area . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , states in the same group are assigned similar colors .",
    "this group structure is robust over timescales of the order of a few years : it is thus worth looking at their evolution over larger timescales .",
    "while in the beginning of the xx century states were mainly separated between northern and southern states and this separation remains stable across many years , this structure suddenly breaks down in the last decades of the xx century , and a new configuration of groups emerge .",
    "the evolution of these groups of states is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    eventually , in the new configuration that emerges at the end of the xx century , some states of the atlantic and of the pacific coasts share common features and belong to the same group , different from that of central states .",
    "in order to better identify these groups of states , we used a hierarchical clustering algorithm .",
    "a better visualization of this transition can be observed in the supplementary videos , which are available online at http://chimera.roma1.infn.it/names/research.html .",
    "this method gives a more quantitative separation with respect to the groups mentioned above , and leads to the formation of clusters , identified by different colors in fig .",
    "the two different methods give the same answer , and make manifest a very interesting social cross - fertilization .",
    "this approach is able to describe the emergence of clusters of states through the analysis of the mutual correlations of their newborns names , and extracts interesting information on the evolution of these clusters .",
    "we do not discuss the origin of these correlations , nor the mechanisms according to which names are given to newborn babies .",
    "some attempts in this direction have been done @xcite .",
    "we also do not study the reasons why there is a reorganization of clusters in the last decades of the xx century , compared to the relatively stable situation of the first half of the century .",
    "this is a very interesting issue that surely deserves a more specific study and we leave it open to future investigations .",
    "regarding this point , we observe that irregularities in the retarded cross correlations between the total distribution of the american names were found around the seventies @xcite .",
    "this effect is probably related to our results .",
    "this effect is probably due to the deep cultural transformation occurred in the united stated after the vietnam war @xcite .",
    "our analysis can be adapted to capture which states influence a given state and which ones are influenced by the same state .",
    "this amount to identify a directed network which may be relevant for studying time correlations and culture propagation . in the internet era",
    "one can get high statistics data about an extremely large number of behaviours and cultural traits : using our approach on the combined ensemble of such abundant datasets should allow to organise a precise quantitative understanding about the functioning of cultural influences and their evolution .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the names occurrences , averaged over years , is shown in fig .",
    "[ sifig1 ] . while it is evident from the figure that the distribution of names has fat tails , it is also clear that it is more complex than a power law .",
    "it has already been discussed18 that this distribution can be fitted with a combination of a beta function and a power law .",
    "the vast majority of names appear and spread fast through the states .",
    "they stay popular for a few years , and then disappear ( or , more precisely , their frequency goes down to very low , endemic levels ) , without keeping a high popularity for a long time .",
    "taking into account many of the most representative names , their popularity rise and fall can be observed in fig .",
    "[ sifig2 ] .",
    "even if this process is not completely symmetric @xcite , the rate of ascent is very similar to the rate of descent , and the main difference is in the left over tail at very large times ( a name that has appeared does not completely disappear ) .      in all years of the time period under investigation the first eigenvalues of the matrix of correlations @xmath3",
    "are well separated from all the other eigenvalues , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sifig3 ] . however , fig .",
    "[ sifig4 ] .",
    "shows that in the last part of the xx century there is no clear separation between the first and the second eigenvalue .",
    "this is not an effect due to the random noise : this point is rather subtle and we will comment it further in the following section . in this section",
    "we discuss how to deal with the noise , and how to identify system - specific , non random , correlations .",
    "one of the possible methods is to compare the spectrum of the correlation matrices with that of random wishart - laguerre matrices @xcite .",
    "this method provides bounds for the random bulk of the spectrum and thus the eigenvalues ( and the corresponding eigenvectors ) outside this interval are thought to yield information on the genuine correlations of the underlying system .",
    "the largest eigenvalues have been shown to play an important role in many situations @xcite , @xcite and we will see below that this is the case also in our problem .",
    "we used a slightly different method to establish that noise is not affecting our findings , comparing the spectrum of correlation matrices with the one of random correlation matrices obtained as follows : in each year , we made a random permutation of the occurrences of the @xmath26 names inside each state , and we used it to compute the correlation matrix @xmath27 , repeating all the steps described in the equations going from eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cij ] ) .",
    "given that @xmath28 , the correlation matrices @xmath27 are similar to identity matrices , whose spectrum is obviously made by ones .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath27 is different from that of @xmath29 , even if the widely used unfolded nearest neighbour spacing distribution ( see for example @xcite ) is similar . in order to rule out a role of the random noise ,",
    "we compared the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) @xmath30 of our data to that of the null model .",
    "this test provides a direct evaluation of the non - random part of the spectrum .",
    "it is defined as follows : be @xmath31 the @xmath0-th component of the ( normalized ) eigenvector @xmath32 such that @xmath33 ; thus @xmath34 ^ 4\\:\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the total number of components .",
    "this quantities is often used in localization problems , since its reciprocal @xmath35 equals the number of states over which a vector is localized . an easy way to understand this point is to use the normalization condition @xmath36 , from which we see that @xmath37 for a vector localized over @xmath38 states .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath39 .",
    "a localized vector is a vector for which @xmath40 , while for non - localized vectors @xmath41 .",
    "we compared the ipr of all the eigenvectors of @xmath3 and @xmath42 and we found that while there is a complete agreement for the respective @xmath30 in the right region of the spectrum ( small eigenvalues ) , there is a clear separation in the left part of the spectrum , which can be interpreted as a deviation from the random matrices behaviour , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sifig5 ] .",
    "the first eigenvalues carry relevant information for the detection of collective modes in the system : they are found to be non - localized , and to give important information on the correlation between states .",
    "the fact that the distribution of names occurrences is fat - tailed is crucial for the qualitative agreement we find in the right region of the spectrum , as it is known that , in cross - correlation matrices of signals sampled from a fat - tailed distribution , eigenvectors corresponding to small eigenvalues are found to be localized @xcite , while this does not happen in the gaussian case , where the ipr is flat @xmath43 for all @xmath44 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us introduce principal component analysis ( pca ) and hierarchical clustering , which are the two methods we used to investigate the genuine correlations of the states through the years .",
    "a simple way to extract informations from the correlation matrix @xmath29 is the principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , which consists in a partial eigen - decomposition of the correlation matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cij ] ) .",
    "it uses just the largest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors to reconstruct collective modes of the system .",
    "it can be described by means of an example .",
    "suppose that the correlation matrix is such that the non - diagonal elements of the line @xmath0 are all very small except for a single element @xmath3 , which is almost one , and that all the other non diagonal terms are also very small ( but @xmath45 ) .",
    "quite intuitively , this situation corresponds to some kind of connection between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the eigenvector of @xmath29 that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue contains this information in its components : indeed , it can be shown that the only component of @xmath46 significantly different from zero are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "now suppose that the correlation matrix is a bit more complicated , and that many non - diagonal elements are large .",
    "although , in some situations this effect is purely due to the noise , often it may happen because complicated pattern are hidden in the system , more complex than pairwise correlations , which involve many states .",
    "it is quite reasonable that eigenvectors of @xmath29 take into account this information , and eigenvectors corresponding to largest eigenvalues are localized on such patterns .",
    "thus pca may led to a reconstruction of the complex correlations among many states . in order",
    "to get rid of the noise contained in the correlation matrices , and to be sure that eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues contains genuinely non - random informations , we proceeded as explained in the previous section .",
    "taking the first two eigenvectors of @xmath29 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , a bi - dimensional representation of these eigenvectors can be obtained by plotting the @xmath12 points of coordinates @xmath51 , one for each state .",
    "this can be done year after year and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sifig8 ] . in these scattered plots ,",
    "clusters / groups of states that are similar , in a sense that will be discussed below , naturally emerge .",
    "the notion of similarity can be understood with the following qualitative description .",
    "let us define @xmath52 , which is a positive definite matrix , whose elements satisfy @xmath53 .",
    "let us assume that the state @xmath0 has large correlation with a group of states @xmath54 , while it has small correlations with the rest of the states , i.e.  @xmath55 when @xmath56 .",
    "let us also assume that another state @xmath57 has a large correlation with a group of states @xmath58 whose overlap with @xmath54 is big enough .",
    "in this case , @xmath0 and @xmath57 are said to be similar , even if the correlation coefficient @xmath59 between them is small , and those two states belong to the same cluster .",
    "these results have been compared with those obtained using an agglomerative hierarchical clusterization based on the matrix @xmath60 .",
    "hierarchical clustering is a method to build a hierarchy of clusters starting from @xmath25 clusters of one state each and such that clusters are merged as one moves up in the hierarchy .",
    "this can be done in many ways .",
    "first one has to define a metric @xmath61 , for example the euclidean one , between the columns of the correlation matrix .",
    "then we have to minimize a certain distance @xmath62 between the clusters @xmath63 and @xmath64 : at each step , the two clusters separated by the shortest distance are merged .",
    "there are several possible definitions of @xmath62 , each one defining a possible criterion to perform the clusterization .",
    "we used the _ complete _ criterion , which is defined by @xmath65 which tends to find compact clusters of approximately equal diameters .",
    "this procedure leads to the construction of a tree diagram called _ dendrogram _ , which can be cut at the height one prefers .",
    "this introduces a sort of arbitrariness in the number of clusters that are considered .",
    "looking at the distribution of the scatter plot in fig .",
    "[ sifig6 ] , we decided to fix the number of clusters to 3 .",
    "it can be noticed that states that are similar in the sense specified before , are found to belong the same cluster . in each year , in order to measure of the quality of the clusterization obtained , we computed the cophenetic coefficient .",
    "given the euclidean distance @xmath66 between the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the corresponding distance that these points have on the dendrogram @xmath67 , cophenetic coefficient @xmath38 can be defined as @xmath68 \\left[\\sum_{i < j}(d(i , j)-\\bar{d})^2\\right]}}. \\label{copheneticcoeff}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are , respectively , the average values of the euclidean and of the dendrogramatic distances .",
    "values of @xmath38 close to one , indicate a good clusterization , since the correlation coefficient between the actual distances and the dendrogrammatic one is large . in each year",
    ", @xmath38 is found to be near @xmath71 and never smaller that @xmath72 .",
    "pca and hierarchical clustering results can be be found in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] of the main text .      as we noticed in fig .",
    "[ sifig4 ] the first eigenvalues are always well separated during the first decades of the xx century , indicating persisting patterns in the states that survive during years . we also noticed that the situation is less clear at the end of the xx century , and there is not a clear separation between the first two eigenvalues . here we will further discuss this point .",
    "in each year , we considered the first two eigenvectors of the correlation matrix @xmath3 and we assigned a color to each state , corresponding to the position it had in the plane spanned by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues .",
    "while these persistent patterns are quite clear in the first decades , indicating a separation between northern states and southern states , we also notice that the situation changes at the end of the xx century , when states start to be grouped between coastal states , and central states ( a better visualization of such a transition can be obtained from the movies available on the website http://chimera.roma1.infn.it/names/research.html that show data for all the years ) . in order to better understand what has happened in the transition years",
    ", we studied how eigenvectors changed during years .",
    "[ sifig4 ] suggests to choose , as a reference , the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix in 1950 , since it is the year with the largest difference @xmath73 .",
    "we then studied how the first three eigenvectors of the correlation matrix in the year @xmath4 are related to those of 1950 . for each year",
    "we evaluated the projections of @xmath57-th eigenvector on @xmath1-th 1950 s eigenvector @xmath74 observing these projections we see that the first eigenvector is rather stable until nineties , when it becomes mostly a superposition of 1950 s second and third eigenvectors .",
    "conversely , after this transition , the second eigenvector is mainly constituted by the first 1950 s eigenvector , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sifig7 ] and fig .",
    "[ sifig8 ] .",
    "these figures provide a clear interpretation of the evolution of the correlations between states : for many decades of the xx century there has been a stable configuration of groups ( clusters ) of states that eventually broke down at the end of the century .",

    "looking at the distribution of baby names is already enough to make a sensible and realistic clusterization of states emerge , and this clusterization is related to cultural influences .",

    "<S> while these groups of states are stable across many decades , a sudden reorganization occurs in the last part of the twentieth century . </S>",
    "<S> we think that this kind of quantitative analysis can be possibly extended to other cultural traits : although databases covering more than one century ( as the one we used ) are rare , the cultural evolution on shorter time scales can be studied thanks to the fact that many human activities are usually recorded in the present digital era .    </S>",
    "<S> cultural traits can be considered as the fundamental blocks of the culture of a community . </S>",
    "<S> they are characterized by a much shorter time scale than cultural movements : while changes in cultural movements may occur over decades or centuries , changes in cultural traits may be observed from a daily to an yearly basis , depending on the trait . </S>",
    "<S> this feature allows one to start from measured data to analyse their reciprocal influence : a cultural trait may promote or prevent the popularity rise of others , a past cultural trait may have an influence on current and future ones and finally the rise or fall of a cultural trait in a certain area may influence cultural traits in other areas .    </S>",

    "<S> they carry important information on the transformation of the social structure . </S>",
    "<S> several quantitative approaches to these problems have been proposed , and we will briefly describe them in the following . when compared to other relevant traits , names appear very appropriate to study cultural changes , since the success of a name mainly depends on the influence that the surrounding culture wields on the parents of the newborns . </S>",
    "<S> other traits suffer , for example , the influence of external forces , such as that due to the producers which may artificially shape the tastes of consumers . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly evident in the fashion market and in the music market @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the frequency distribution of names given to newborns have fat tails , typical of many physical problems @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the popularity of a name was also shown to be correlated with the popularity of similar names in previous years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , names were analized in terms of activation and inhibition processes @xcite , in order to explain their popularity rise and fall and the duration of the rise time and fall time of the popularity of names were found to be correlated @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this approach is different from the _ neutral model _ proposed in @xcite , where naming was considered in close connection with the infinite - allele model of population genetics with a random genetic drift . a preference model of fashion @xcite where individuals can copy each others preferences in addition to traits themselves , </S>",
    "<S> was said to better reproduce the empirical features of the american baby names . </S>",
    "<S> these previous studies on names were mainly focused on global distributions , but not at the relations between local distributions of names in different states ( i.e. distributions in single states ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that much can be learned , for example , from the relations between local distributions of names in different states . </S>",
    "<S> our main working hypothesis is that local changes of names convey a large body of information on the mutual cultural influences that communities ( states ) wield on each other .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus our correlation analysis on different states of the united states of america during the xx century . </S>",
    "<S> statistics on names given to newborns in the united states can be downloaded from the web - page of the us social security administration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different states have different popularity spreading curves for each name , fig . [ fig1 ] </S>",
