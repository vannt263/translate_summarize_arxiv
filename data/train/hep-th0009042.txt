    "d - branes as probes of string theory in nontrivial backgrounds have been a source of useful insights since @xcite . in @xcite douglas and",
    "moore used a quotient construction to study the dynamics of branes at an orbifold singularity .",
    "the construction involves a choice of a representation of the quotient group on the chan  paton indices .",
    "this leads to a supersymmetric gauge theory on the worldvolume ( as we review later on ) .",
    "the moduli space of vacua of this theory contains an approximation to the geometry of the transverse space in which the brane is free to move .",
    "the parameters in the theory are determined by the closed - string background ; the parameter space thus probes the moduli space of closed - string vacua .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for a larger account of this work .",
    "let us consider a type iib string on the local form of an orbifold @xmath0 for some finite group @xmath1 .",
    "it has been clear from the early days of this subject that d - branes give a particularly direct physical picture of the `` mckay correspondence '' .",
    "that is , there is a relationship between the even - dimensional homology , or more properly k - theory , of the resolution of such an orbifold and the representation theory of @xmath2 .",
    "( we refer to @xcite for a review of the mathematics of the mckay correspondence . )",
    "it was realized in @xcite that by computing the masses of wrapped branes as one blew - up a singularity , one could relate the homology of the blow - up to representations of @xmath2 .",
    "this correspondence was made much more explicit in @xcite where the explicit map between homology and representation theory was computed .",
    "douglas @xcite was able to extend the work of @xcite by considering _",
    "projective _ representations .",
    "it is very natural to associate this degree of freedom with vafa s discrete torsion @xcite",
    ". it would be nice to extend the mckay correspondence to include discrete torsion .",
    "the work of gomis @xcite is related to this question and we explore the subject further in this paper .",
    "there has also been some work associating discrete torsion with monodromy acting on partial resolutions @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss this here .",
    "our aim in this paper is to cover the following topics :    1 .",
    "we will present a computation of the moduli space of vacua determined by the `` regular representation '' and its relation to the target space geometry in the general case .",
    "this involves extending some proofs by sardo infirri @xcite to the case of discrete torsion .",
    "we will also discuss how wrapped branes appear when the singularity is not isolated .",
    "much has already been said about these topics in the context of specific examples and various generalizations .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "2 .   we will use the mckay correspondence for k - theory to _ define _ a theory of stringy homology on the orbifold itself . in the absence of discrete torsion",
    "this agrees with the known results obtained by studying the masses of wrapped branes .",
    "the stringy homology will exhibit torsion when , and only when , discrete torsion is switched on",
    ". this construction will be closely related to observations in @xcite .",
    "3 .   we will discuss if there is such a thing as an s - duality of the type iib string which literally exchanges the string and the d1-brane .    of particular note in the second case is the relationship between torsion in homology and discrete torsion .",
    "this has been analyzed in some cases ( see , for example , @xcite ) but the general picture remains unclear .",
    "at least for the local analysis of an orbifold we hope to shed some light on this question .",
    "we will see that the torsion in homology naturally contains a subgroup of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the order of the element of discrete torsion within the group @xmath5 .",
    "in section [ s : quiv ] we set up many aspects of the group theory we use and describe how to construct quiver diagrams . in section [",
    "s : mod ] we give a general proof that the moduli space of the d - brane associated with a point really is the target space @xmath0 only in the case of an isolated singularity .",
    "we give the general description of the non - isolated case in terms of the familiar `` wrapped branes '' which are associated to induced representations of @xmath2 .    in section [",
    "s : mckay ] we set up the mckay correspondence for orbifolds with discrete torsion .",
    "this amounts to defining what we mean by homology .",
    "the previous sections are clarified by reviewing some examples in section [ s : eg ] .",
    "we draw the quiver corresponding to the field theory , analyze the possibilities for wrapped branes and compute some stringy homology groups .    finally in section",
    "[ s : conc ] we emphasize the relationship between torsion in homology and discrete torsion .",
    "we also discuss the s - duality of the type iib string .",
    "in this section we will encode the data associated to a d - brane on an orbifold in terms of a quiver diagram .",
    "we will be general here and present the analysis for any representation of the orbifold group and any choice of discrete torsion .",
    "for definiteness , we will discuss the case mentioned above , of d3-branes near a singularity of the local form @xmath6 .",
    "the worldvolume theory is then an @xmath7 supersymmetric theory in four dimensions .",
    "our analysis follows the discussion in @xcite with the ( small ) modifications required to incorporate discrete torsion .",
    "the orbifold theory is constructed following @xcite as a quotient from a theory of branes on the covering space .",
    "let the brane be located at a point in @xmath8 which is fixed under all of @xmath2 .",
    "we will assume this point is the origin .",

    "this is a gauge theory with three chiral multiplets @xmath15 in the adjoint representation ( corresponding to the three complex transverse coordinates ) and a superpotential given by @xmath16\\right ) .",

    "the theory we obtain under the quotienting process depends very much on @xmath9 . to begin with , and to fix our notations",
    ", we take @xmath9 to be a linear representation , corresponding to the absence of discrete torsion .    the quotient theory will also be a gauge theory . because the gauge fields live in the directions tangent to the brane , @xmath2 acts on these only via @xmath9 .",
    "the gauge fields in the quotient theories will generate the subgroup of @xmath17 which is invariant under this action @xmath18 for all @xmath19 . to facilitate the following discussions",
    "we will introduce some fancier notation .",
    "first let us complexify the gauge group .",
    "our initial complexified gauge group will be @xmath20 .",
    "the invariant complexified gauge group @xmath21 is then generated by all matrices @xmath22 which satisfy ( [ eq : inva ] ) . we write this as @xmath23 these gauge fields will appear in appropriate supermultiplets . in our case",
    "we find vector multiplets .",
    "additional degrees of freedom in the low - energy theory come from the invariant degrees of freedom contained in the chiral multiplets .",
    "@xmath2 acts on these , in addition to its embedding in @xmath24 , via the @xmath25-dimensional representation @xmath26 determining its action on @xmath8 .",
    "the invariant degrees of freedom now satisfy @xmath27 for all @xmath19 . in our more abstract notation this is written as @xmath28 in addition to the gauge couplings , these interact via a cubic superpotential that is simply the restriction to the invariant fields of the superpotential ( [ eq : wcov ] ) .    to allow for discrete torsion",
    "we allow @xmath9 to be a _ projective _ representation .",
    "that is @xmath29 where @xmath30 . for any @xmath31 . ]",
    "the associativity of group multiplication is consistent with this provided @xmath32 which is precisely the condition that @xmath33 is a group 2-cocycle .",
    "further , it is clear that two cocycles related by @xmath34 for any map @xmath35 lead to equivalent conditions ( [ eq : proj ] ) .",
    "this shows that the allowed representations are determined by @xmath36 as an element of @xmath5 .",
    "a choice of a cohomology class @xmath36 then determines the phases @xmath37 associated to twisted sectors in vafa s formulation @xcite by @xmath38 ( note this need only be defined for commuting @xmath39 ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "we can now repeat the calculation of the quotient theory as above .",
    "we find it useful to resort to fairly algebraic language .",
    "any standard text on the representation theory of finite groups should explain all the terms we use .",
    "let us introduce the @xmath40-algebra @xmath41 defined as follows .",
    "firstly we let @xmath42 , @xmath19 , be a basis for @xmath41 .",
    "that is , any element may be written uniquely as a sum @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "we define a distributive product by @xmath45 the standard theory of representations and modules now says that _ any projective representation of @xmath2 can be written as a @xmath41-module .",
    "_ naturally we may obtain linear representations by using the trivial @xmath36 to obtain @xmath46-modules .",
    "let @xmath47 represent the _ irreducible _ representations of @xmath2 twisted by @xmath48 .",
    "it is well - known that irreducible _ linear _ representations of @xmath2 are counted by the number of conjugacy classes of @xmath2 .",
    "there is a similar concept for projective representations .",
    "an `` @xmath36-regular '' conjugacy class contains elements @xmath31 satisfying @xmath49 for all @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "the number of irreducible projective representations is equal to the number of @xmath36-regular conjugacy classes .",
    "we may view @xmath47 as _ simple _ @xmath41-modules .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an exposition of the properties of irreducible projective representations .",
    "we may then decompose @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a linear vector space whose dimension is determined by the number of times a given irreducible representation appears in @xmath9 .",
    "let us use @xmath54 to denote the group of homomorphisms of @xmath41-modules .",
    "we may now deduce that for @xmath55 @xmath56 where the penultimate step was obtained by using schur s lemma .",
    "thus if we denote @xmath57 we see that @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , restricting back to the compact real form , we have a gauge group @xmath59    since @xmath26 is a linear representation of @xmath2 and @xmath9 is a projective representation twisted by @xmath36 , it is not hard to show that @xmath60 is a projective representation twisted by @xmath36 .",
    "we may thus decompose @xmath61 where @xmath62 are vector spaces .",
    "we may then deduce @xmath63 as above , in addition to the gauge couplings , the chiral multiplets interact via a cubic superpotential descended from ( [ eq : wcov ] ) .",
    "a useful way of visualizing the structure of the resulting theory is in terms of a _",
    "quiver_.    1 .",
    "there is a node for every irreducible representation @xmath47 .",
    "each node is labelled by @xmath64 .",
    "each node represents a factor of @xmath65 in the gauge group @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   from node @xmath67 to node @xmath10",
    "we draw @xmath68 arrows .",
    "each arrow represents a contribution of @xmath69 to the space in which @xmath70 lives .",
    "that is , the arrow represents a @xmath71 representation of @xmath72 .",
    "note that the numbers @xmath73 , and hence the arrows , are fixed by @xmath2 and @xmath36 and do not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "the numbers @xmath74 do depend on @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath75 for a particular node then one can ignore that vertex and the associated arrows .",
    "we will give several examples of quivers below .",
    "one object of immediate interest is the moduli space of classical vacua of the gauge theory .",
    "the is the zero string - coupling limit of the moduli space of the associated brane in the orbifold background .",
    "the classical vacua are parameterized by values for the scalars in the chiral multiplets , modulo gauge equivalence , solving @xmath76-term equations ( critical points of the superpotential ) as well as the @xmath77-term equations ( zero moment maps for the action of @xmath66 ) .",
    "the details of these depend upon @xmath9 , but since the quotient theory is obtained from the covering theory simply be reducing the gauge group to a subgroup of @xmath24 and setting some of the chiral fields to zero , we can give a uniform description directly in terms of the covering theory . from ( [ eq : wcov ] ) we have the @xmath76-terms @xmath78=0,\\quad\\text{for all $ i , j$ }    \\label{eq : fterm}\\ ] ] where in a particular quotient we keep only the invariant components of @xmath70 .",

    "one then divides the solution set of these equations by the gauge group @xmath66 to obtain @xmath80 .",
    "the key idea of the physics of d - branes on the orbifold is the following    the space @xmath80 represents the space of allowed positions of the d - brane associated to @xmath9 in the target space @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest case of using an irreducible representation for @xmath9 tends to give @xmath80 equal to a point  the wrapped d - brane is stuck at the origin .",
    "one obtains more interesting results by using bigger representations .",
    "of particular note is the case when @xmath9 is given by putting @xmath81 .",
    "( that is , we view @xmath81 itself as a @xmath41-module . )",
    "when @xmath36 is trivial , this is equivalent to making @xmath9 the _ regular representation_. the regular representation even when @xmath36 is nontrivial .",
    "this was implicit in @xcite . ]",
    "note that now @xcite @xmath82 taking the dimension of @xmath41 as a vector space over @xmath40 , this implies a result which will be useful later on : @xmath83    we may now prove the following theorems :    [ th : a ] if @xmath81 and @xmath2 acts freely on @xmath8 outside the origin then @xmath80 is the orbifold @xmath0 itself .",

    "therefore the above implies that @xmath90 for any choice of @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",

    "in particular @xmath94=0.\\ ] ] this means that each matrix @xmath15 is _ normal _ and can be diagonalized by conjugation by a unitary matrix @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore ( [ eq : fterm ] ) implies that @xmath15 can be simultaneously diagonalized for all @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath96 be a simultaneous eigenvector of @xmath15 with eigenvalues @xmath97 .",
    "denote the basis of @xmath98 by @xmath99 , @xmath100 . we then write @xmath101    now , the fact that @xmath102 tells us that @xmath103 and so @xmath104 in other words @xmath105 is an eigenvector of @xmath70 with eigenvalue @xmath106 . * note in particular that the eigenvalues must always appear as @xmath2-orbits in @xmath26 .",
    "* let us denote @xmath105 by @xmath107 .",
    "now let us first assume that the action of @xmath2 on @xmath26 has no fixed points away from the origin .",
    "then assuming @xmath108 is non - zero , the eigenvalues are all distinct and so the vectors @xmath107 will form an orthogonal basis for @xmath81 .",
    "we may fix this basis to be orthonormal .",
    "let us choose a fixed orthonormal basis for @xmath41 by fixing @xmath109 and then defining @xmath110 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath111 diagonalizing the @xmath15 can be taken to rotate the @xmath107 basis into the @xmath42 basis .",
    "that is , @xmath112 , for all @xmath31 .",
    "note that for any @xmath50 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 thus @xmath111 and @xmath115 commute which implies that @xmath116 .",
    "so now , we see that a point @xmath80 is determined by the eigenvalues @xmath117 , up to permutations .",
    "what we have shown above is that this set is precisely in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath2-orbits in @xmath26 . that the correspondence is onto is easy to see by taking diagonal matrices",
    "this proves theorem  [ th : a ] .    we now come to the more interesting case of a non - isolated fixed point at the origin .",
    "again the analysis of sardo infirri @xcite applies even with discrete torsion switched on .",
    "a fairly simple argument in linear algebra may be used to show that @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 be any point in @xmath26 and let @xmath120 be the subgroup of @xmath2 which fixes @xmath119 .",
    "we assume @xmath120 is trivial for a generic @xmath121 .",
    "given @xmath119 , we may construct @xmath70 such that its eigenvalues are given by the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath119 with each eigenvalue appearing with multiplicity @xmath122 . now",
    "this matrix will have eigenvectors forming an orthonormal basis of @xmath9 and we again recover the above construction .",
    "note also that if @xmath119 lies in an open neighbourhood such that @xmath2 acts freely on this neighbourhood then this inclusion @xmath123 is locally a homeomorphism on this subset .",
    "thus @xmath124 appears as a component of @xmath80 .",
    "a key point however is that if @xmath120 is nontrivial we may choose @xmath70 to have eigenvalues @xmath119 of multiplicity _ less than _ @xmath122 .",
    "suppose we have a point @xmath121 away from the origin which is fixed by @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath119 will now have fewer than @xmath126 points .",
    "we may build an @xmath70 which is diagonal and whose eigenvalues correspond to the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath119 together with zero for the remaining eigenvalues .",
    "this is clearly a valid @xmath70 which lies outside any one - to - one correspondence between @xmath80 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus we see that theorem  [ th : a ] _ must _ fail if the quotient singularity is not isolated at the origin .",
    "this proves theorem  [ th : b ] .",
    "these extra branches of @xmath80 correspond to the wrapped branes discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that one must always obtain extra branches of the moduli space corresponding to wrapped branes if the quotient singularity in @xmath124 is not isolated .",
    "the analysis of @xcite tells us exactly how to describe these extra branches .",
    "again the description remains valid with discrete torsion switched on .",
    "suppose @xmath119 is a point away from the origin fixed by @xmath120 as above .",
    "we may consider an @xmath36-twisted projective representation @xmath127 of @xmath120 .",
    "this `` induces '' a representation of @xmath2 of the form @xmath128 ( where @xmath41 is viewed as a left @xmath41-module and a right @xmath129-module ) .",
    "this induced representation will represent a `` wrapped brane '' which can be constrained to live along the fixed locus of @xmath120 if @xmath127 is chosen to have sufficiently low dimension .",
    "using an irreducible representation for @xmath127 will always yield such an example .",
    "if we take the `` regular representation '' @xmath129 for @xmath127 then clearly @xmath130 this shows how a suitable sum of these wrapped branes `` stuck '' along the fixed point set will combine to give the brane associated to @xmath41 .",
    "this represents the set of wrapped branes corresponding to one or more of the extra branches of the moduli space .",
    "looking at all fixed subspaces in the orbifold will account for all the branches .",
    "conversely , given a representation @xmath9 of @xmath2 , we may describe the moduli space associated to @xmath9 as follows .",
    "@xmath9 can be induced by various subgroups .",
    "we need to consider each _ minimal _ such subgroup , in the sense that it contains no other subgroups that induce @xmath9 . the moduli space corresponding to @xmath9 will be the union of the fixed point sets of these minimal subgroups .",
    "we will give several examples of these induced representations in section [ s : eg ] .",
    "the general idea of the mckay correspondence is as follows .",
    "let @xmath131 be a crepent ( i.e. , maintaining the  condition ) maximal blow - up .",
    "the homology of @xmath132 is then closely related to the representation theory of @xmath2 .",
    "one of the most straight - forward but crude ways of seeing this correspondence in d - branes arises from the work of @xcite .",
    "let us begin by considering the particular case of the representation @xmath81 as in the previous section .",
    "each node in the quiver associated to a d - brane on a orbifold can be associated to a potential fayet - iliopoulos term in the d - brane action .",
    "it is well - established ( see @xcite for example ) that adding such terms into the action can result in a blow - up of @xmath133 .",
    "note that this fact remains true even when discrete torsion is switched on .",
    "the way to picture these blow - ups is most easily seen in terms of _ moment maps_. note that @xmath134,\\ ] ] represents a moment map @xmath135 .",
    "the effect of adding fayet - iliopoulos terms to the action is to effectively shift this moment map @xmath136 for some new moment map @xmath137 lying in the centre of @xmath138 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "the centre of @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath139 s associated to each vertex of the quiver .",
    "we have fixed our basis of representations @xmath47 to label each of these vertices .",
    "thus we may expand @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a basis _ dual _ to the representations @xmath47 .",
    "one may add the same terms to the action by adding insertions of closed string twist fields .",
    "let us review the case for no discrete torsion .",
    "an appendix in @xcite showed how these twist fields are related precisely to the fayet - iliopoulos terms .",
    "let @xmath142 be a field in the ns - ns sector of the string theory twisted by @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath143 , where the sum is taken over the conjugacy classes of @xmath2 . using the orthogonality of the characters",
    "@xmath144 we may rewrite this as @xmath145 ( where we have rescaled @xmath142 ) .",
    "including the possibility of discrete torsion actually makes little difference to this argument .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the twisted strings in a theory with discrete torsion are precisely those corresponding to @xmath36-regular conjugacy classes .",
    "now the theory of characters of projective representations and @xmath36-regular conjugacy classes is essentially identical to the usual theory of characters and conjugacy classes .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ eq : m1 ] ) is still true with discrete torsion switched on so long as we use the relevant notions of projective representations .    for a given @xmath19 , we may write the eigenvalues of @xmath31 as @xmath146 , @xmath147 ,  , @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "it is then a well - known result of topological field theory that we may then associate @xmath142 with an element of @xmath150 with @xmath151 ( presumably this cohomology group relates to cohomology with compact support as our target space is not compact . )",
    "notable fields are those obeying @xmath152 .",
    "these correspond to marginal deformations and relate to deformations of the khler form in @xmath153 .",
    "the formalism of topological field theory extends this to the case @xmath154 .    to return to the basis @xmath47 naturally associated to the vertices of our quiver we need to take the dual of this mapping and",
    "so we relate the group generated by the representations of @xmath2 to the _ homology _ of the resolution .",
    "we may then state our first draft of the d - brane mckay correspondence :    let @xmath132 be a maximal crepent resolution of @xmath0 allowed by a given choice ( possibly trivial ) of discrete torsion .",
    "for any @xmath19 we associate a cycle in @xmath155 to the d - brane with representation @xmath156 .",
    "one can have immediate success with this conjecture by considering the case of the untwisted sector given by @xmath157 .",
    "this conjecture then says that the associated homology class lies in @xmath158 and corresponds to @xmath159 . in section  [ s : mod ]",
    "we saw how the representation @xmath41 had the entire target space @xmath0 as ( at least one component ) its moduli space .",
    "this agrees beautifully with it being the moduli space of a single point .",
    "this idea of associating a point with @xmath41 indeed goes back to the original work of @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see from arguments along the lines of section  [ s : mod ] that taking @xmath9 to be two copies of @xmath41 will give a symmetric product of @xmath0 with itself ( again with potentially further branches which we ignore for now ) .",
    "this is thus the moduli space of two points .",
    "clearly this argument works for any number of points",
    ". we will therefore take this conjecture to be true in the case of @xmath158 .",
    "that is , * a point is always given by the representation @xmath41 .",
    "*    as soon as one tries to go beyond this simple case one immediately runs into difficulty .",
    "the reason for this is clear . in the language of @xcite , the twisted fields @xmath142 are a natural basis of cohomology in the _ orbifold _ phase whereas one would normally like to picture the homology in question as living in the large radius _ _ phase .",
    "one therefore needs to change basis between these phases to get the right statement for the mckay correspondence .",
    "this change of basis was essentially described in @xcite and has been described in exactly this context in @xcite .",
    "we refer to these references for more details .",
    "having said all this , it might come as a surprise that the case of @xmath158 worked out so nicely . why did nt we have to mix in other twist fields to to get the classical @xmath158 ? a special rle is given to @xmath158 essentially because we are working in a _",
