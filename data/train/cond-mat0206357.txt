    "conjugated organic molecules such as short - chain oligomers and longer - chain polymers are very promising active materials for low - cost , large - area optoelectronic and photonic devices.@xcite semiconducting properties are defined by the ability of these materials to efficiently transport charge ( holes or electrons ) along the chain due to their @xmath0-conjugation or between adjacent chains due to the @xmath0-orbital overlap of neighboring molecules .",

    "polyfluorenes ( pf ) have emerged as attractive alternatives , showing the highest photoluminescence quantum efficiency ( 55% ) compared to other conjugated polymers / molecules in solid state@xcite and also maintain a high hole mobility at room temperature.@xcite since high photoluminescence quantum yield ( plqy ) is the primary consideration in devices such as oleds , mechanisms that change the plqy are crucial to the understanding and design of these devices .",
    "optical processes that reduce the plqy include competing non - radiative processes , transitions that depopulate the ground state due to reabsorption of photons from singlet states , or situations that can involve intermolecular interactions .",
    "the temperature dependence of electronic states in inorganic semiconductors and heterostructures has been studied extensively in the last 30 years or so . in these systems",
    "the band gaps exhibit large shifts and lifetime induced broadenings as a function of temperature.@xcite one of the first empirical models to explain the temperature dependence of the band gap energy in bulk semiconductors was put forward by varshni.@xcite subsequently , there have been other empirical models taking into account an average bose - einstein statistical factor for phonons to explain the temperature dependence of the electronic states.@xcite this latter model fits the temperature dependence of the transition energies better in narrow - well inorganic semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices.@xcite    in inorganic semiconductors the two mechanisms that are responsible for the temperature dependence of energy bands at constant pressure are thermal expansion and renormalization of band energies by electron - phonon interactions .",
    "typically the former mechanism has a negligible effect so that the changes in the band gap energies arise primarily from electron - phonon interactions .",
    "theoretical calculations of the temperature dependence of band energies in si and ge that take into account such electron - phonon interactions agree very well with the experimental results.@xcite    the motivation of this work is to understand the temperature dependence of the electronic states in organic semiconductors using steady state photoluminescence ( pl ) spectroscopy and to test the extension of the existing models for inorganic semiconductors to organic materials .",

    "the samples were loaded in a cryostat and evacuated to below 100 mtorr to prevent photo - oxidative damage .",

    "a vibronic progression is seen in the pl emission for all the materials under consideration , indicating a coupling of the backbone carbon - carbon stretch vibration to electronic transitions .",
    "the vibronic spacing in all the samples lies between 1300 and 1400 @xmath6 .",
    "the vibronic peaks result from a non - zero overlap of different vibronic wavefunctions of the electronic ground and excited states .",
    "the emissive transition highest in energy is called the 0 - 0 transition , which takes place between the zeroth vibronic level in the excited state and the zeroth vibronic level in the ground state .",

    "the huang - rhys factor therefore corresponds to the average number of phonons that are involved when the excited molecule relaxes from its ground state configuration to the new equilibrium configuration in the excited state ( after the absorption of a photon ) and @xmath14 is the relaxation energy .",
    "if we assume that @xmath11 is the same for ground and excited states and that the potentials are perfectly parabolic , @xmath9 can be determined from the fractional intensity of the vibronic peaks .",

    "conjugated polymers can be viewed as an inhomogeneous collection of varying - length chain segments . time- and",
    "frequency - resolved optical studies show that after a photon excites a chain segment with energy above the threshold , the exciton that is created executes a random walk through the density of states via frster energy transfer,@xcite until it becomes trapped on a low - energy site , from where emission occurs .",

    "a similar behavior has been observed in other conjugated polymers such as ppv@xcite and meh - ppv.@xcite though the general trend in pl energies as a function of temperature is similar in the conjugated polymers investigated in this work , there are differences in the magnitude of their shifts with increasing temperatures",

    "it is therefore not surprising that php has a higher @xmath9-factor compared to the polymers . from fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] it is seen that php shows a saturation effect at higher temperatures .",
    "this may be related to the fact that since the electronic transition energies red shift with increasing temperatures , there may be a higher overlap of the 0 - 0 peak with absorption resulting in a further decrease in the intensity of the 0 - 0 peak in addition to the effect of temperature .",
    "a decrease in @xmath9 with decreasing temperatures has been observed in other works and is interpreted as an effect arising from increased conjugation due to exciton delocalization.@xcite this picture by itself can not explain the temperature dependence of the pl from both the conjugated polymers and the shorter molecules , since php clearly shows a blue shift of transition energies with decreasing temperatures .",
    "we also observe the pl emission from quaterphenyl powder to blue shift with decreasing temperatures .",
    "therefore we must really look at these systems separately : the conjugated polymers that have a distribution of chain lengths and the shorter molecules that have more or less the same chain length distribution .",
    "the electronic energies in bulk inorganic semiconductors display temperature dependence mainly due to renormalization of band energies by electron - phonon interactions .",
