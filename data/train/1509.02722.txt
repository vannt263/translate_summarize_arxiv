    "the al impurity is one of the most commonly observed defects in irradiated quartz sio@xmath0 , by which a tetravalent si cation is replaced with a trivalent al atom .",
    "the al / si substitution results in an unpaired electron ( or , in an equivalent description , a hole ) which , based on early experimental observations , has been identified to be trapped in a nonbonding @xmath1 orbital of an o atom surrounding the substitutional al.@xcite the corresponding neutral al defect center ( hereafter also denoted @xmath2}^0 $ ] ) is magnetically active , and has been the subject of extensive characterization by electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr),@xcite also in combination with absorption spectroscopy.@xcite    from the theory side , it has been recognized that the reproduction of the experimentally observed features of the @xmath2}^0$]center is subordinate to a correct description of the hole localization properties . since early density - functional theory ( dft )",
    "calculations using ( semi)local density functionals gave a wrong picture , predicting the hole to be delocalized over all the four al nearest - neighbor o atoms,@xcite this problem has been identified as a challenging testing ground for novel density - functional methods.@xcite    the wrong description of ( semi)local dft functionals has been ascribed to incomplete cancellation of the self - interaction ( si ) brought in by the hartree term,@xcite since calculations using exactly si - free hamiltonians , such as unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) and self - interaction - corrected ( sic ) dft , yield the correct hole localization .",
    "pacchioni  _ et al . _ also performed unrestricted second - order mller - plesset perturbation theory ( ump2 ) calculations,@xcite concluding that no appreciable role is played by correlation in the specific problem at hand .",
    "a now routinely used approach allowing to partially amend the si error is based on admixing a fraction of hartree - fock exact exchange ( exx ) to semilocal exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "however , popular recipes for such hybrid functionals , prescribing @xmath3 or @xmath4 of exx , such as in b3lyp,@xcite pbe0,@xcite and hse06 ( ref .  ) have proven to fail in describing charge localization in al - doped silica.@xcite thus , it has been argued that a large amount of exx would be necessary to obtain agreement with experiments,@xcite much like a large enough hubbard @xmath5 parameter is needed within dft+@xmath5 to solve the same problem.@xcite for instance , to  _ et al . _ found that a semi - empirical hybrid functional including @xmath6 of exx ( called bb1k functional ) yields the correct picture.@xcite    in view of the preceding work , it may be concluded that some amount of empiricism is required to tackle the al - impurity problem within dft , casting doubts on its actual predictive power .",
    "recently , a rationale for the value that the exx fraction takes in extended systems has been put forward.@xcite starting from the many - body @xmath7 approximation to the electron self - energy @xmath8 , one obtains , in its static limit ( @xmath9 ) , the so - called coulomb - hole - plus - screened - exchange ( cohsex ) approximation to @xmath10.@xcite by performing a spatial average of the electron gas polarization function , one is finally left with a simple analytical expression for the exx fraction , which is now expressed in terms of the macroscopic electronic dielectric constant of the material .",
    "thus , the exx fraction can be obtained _ ab initio _ for a given material once its dielectric constant is computed within dft ; a self - consistent approach to the definition of such _ self - consistent dielectric - dependent hybrid functional _ has been recently proposed and tested for various properties of oxide semiconductors and insulators.@xcite notice that cohsex treats the exchange term exactly , and hence is si free ; it thus constitutes the ideal candidate for modeling systems whose ground state is dominated by the classical hartree and electron exchange fock interactions .",
    "all - electron dft calculations were performed within the linear combination of atomic orbitals approach as implemented in the crystal09 code.@xcite the following all - electron basis sets were employed : 66 - 21g@xmath11 for si ( ref .  ) , 8 - 411(@xmath121 ) for o ( ref .  ) , 85 - 11g@xmath11 for al ( ref .  ) .",
    "a full - range hybrid functional@xcite was adopted for the treatment of exchange and correlation ; the fraction of admixed exx ( @xmath13 ) was evaluated based on the above - mentioned relationship with the macroscopic electronic dielectric constant ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15,@xcite and obtained self - consistently for pristine quartz sio@xmath0 , following the procedure illustrated in ref .  .",
    "the resulting functional is referred to as `` @xmath16 '' in the following , as it is _ de facto _ a self - consistent ( sc ) re - parametrization of the pbe0 hybrid functional.@xcite the dielectric constant @xmath14 was computed within the coupled - perturbed kohn - sham method implemented in the crystal09 code.@xcite    the al center was modeled in an embedding @xmath17 quartz sio@xmath0 supercell ( 72 atoms ) with the atomic positions and lattice parameters fully relaxed for the bulk cell using the @xmath16functional . for the defective supercell ,",
    "further optimization of the atomic positions was carried out at fixed lattice parameters .",
    "the standard thresholds defined in crystal09 were adopted in all geometry optimizations.@xcite the brillouin zone was sampled by using 8 @xmath18-points in the irreducible wedge.@xcite    the charge - transition levels were computed according to the formalism illustrated in refs .  .",
    "in particular , total - energy differences relative to the defect charge state variation were computed using defect kohn - sham ( ks ) eigenvalues , following the approach proposed in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath19 ks eigenvalue of si was taken as reference for aligning band structures in defect and bulk calculations . the spurious electrostatic interaction between image charged defects",
    "was accounted for by correcting the ks eigenvalues according to the procedure illustrated by chen and pasquarello,@xcite and based on the makov - payne correction scheme.@xcite",
    "within the @xmath16approach , the dielectric constant of quartz sio@xmath0 turns out to be @xmath20 ( the experimental value is 2.38 , see ref .   and references therein ) , which corresponds to an exchange fraction @xmath21 .",
    "the method predicts a somewhat overestimated band gap of 11.6  ev , whereas various experiments measured it in the quite broad range of @xmath22  ev.@xcite the failure of the @xmath16functional in computing reliable band gaps for some insulators with very low dielectric constants ( and correspondingly large band gaps ) was already reported in refs .  , being particularly serious when the geometry is re - optimized at each self - consistency step ( see for instance the case of mgo , which has a dielectric constant of @xmath23).@xcite    however , here we are mainly concerned with the description of the hole localization at the @xmath2}^0$]center , which is a ground state property ; the related spectroscopic features will be deferred to a separate discussion in section  [ subs : optical_properties ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the local atomic structure of sio@xmath0 around the al impurity , as found by minimizing the total electronic energy using the @xmath16functional and allowing for symmetry - breaking atomic relaxations , which amounts at independently optimizing the positions of each atom of the ( o@xmath24 , o@xmath0 ) and ( o@xmath25 , o@xmath26 ) oxygen pairs ( where the two o within each pair are equivalent to each other in the bulk sio@xmath0 structure ) .",
    "the emerging picture agrees very well with that obtained within other rigorously si - free approaches , such as uhf@xcite and sic - dft.@xcite in particular , the hole introduced by the substitutional al atom is trapped at the o(1 ) atom , its wavefunction exhibiting purely @xmath1 character , with the corresponding orbital lying almost perpendicularly to the al - o - si plane . as a consequence of the charge localization ,",
    "the local atomic structure distorts considerably : the o(1 ) atom moves away from the al atom , resulting in an average equilibrium al - o distance @xmath27 larger compared to the other al - o distances ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the results of our calculations are in agreement with the experimental evidence as obtained from epr investigations:@xcite ( i ) the hole localizes in the nonbonding @xmath1 orbital of the o atom corresponding to the longer si - o - type bond in pure sio@xmath0 ; ( ii ) the @xmath1 orbital is perpendicular to the al - o - si plane ; ( iii ) the localization causes the hole - bearing oxygen to move away @xmath28 farther from the al center with respect to the other o atoms .    for comparison , we also tested the performance of the becke s three - parameter hybrid functional ( b3lyp),@xcite incorporating @xmath3 of exx . from table  [ tab1 ] it is inferred that , while some asymmetry is still present in the resulting optimized structure , the elongation of the al - o(1 ) distance is now at most @xmath29 larger than the other al - o distances .",
    "the mulliken population analysis presented in table  [ tab2 ] shows that in the b3lyp ground state the unpaired electron charge density is distributed over the ( o(1 ) , o(2 ) ) pair , with a substantial contribution also from a @xmath1 orbital of the o(2 ) atom [ see also figure  [ fig1](b ) ] , at variance with the experimental evidence .",
    "the final picture is not dissimilar if the optimization is started from the distorted structure of the @xmath2}^0$]center optimized at the @xmath16level:@xcite the al - o(1 ) elongation now amounts at about @xmath30 , and the unpaired electron is delocalized over the ( o(1 ) , o(2 ) ) pair with roughly the same proportions as reported in table  [ tab2 ] . in some of the previous b3lyp studies of al - doped sio@xmath0 the inequivalence of the o(1 ) and o(2 ) sites",
    "is not even qualitatively captured ( same al - o distances ) , and the hole is found evenly delocalized over two , or even over all the four o atoms nearest to the al impurity.@xcite    .[tab1 ] nearest - neighbor si - o and al - o distances ( @xmath31 ) for pure bulk and al - doped sio@xmath0 ( @xmath2}^0 $ ] ) , respectively .",

    "the hyperfine coupling matrix , describing the magnetic interaction of the spin of the unpaired electron with the spin of the neighboring nuclei ( @xmath37o and @xmath38al ) , is conveniently divided into an isotropic ( spherically symmetric ) and an anisotropic ( dipolar ) part .",
    "the isotropic part ( denoted @xmath33 ) is proportional to the electron spin density at the nucleus , and , as such , the dominant contribution to it is caused by spin - polarization of the @xmath39 electrons .",

    "concerning the anisotropic parameters of @xmath37o , our @xmath16calculations nicely capture the experimentally observed strong anisotropy along the three axes , and numerical values are in good agreement with both experiments and the results of previous investigations based on si - free approaches ( uhf , ump2 , sic - dft).@xcite in contrast , b3lyp yields a quantitatively wrong picture , the computed parameters being substantially smaller in absolute value than experimental ones .",
    "the situation is quite the opposite for the isotropic part , for which @xmath16overestimates the absolute value of @xmath33 , while b3lyp yields it exceptionally close to experiment .",
    "we argue that the latter result is fortuitous , in the sense that it is not concomitant with a correspondingly more accurate description of the hole localization .",
    "firstly , as already discussed , at the b3lyp level the o(2 ) atom carries a substantial part of the hole - related spin density ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) , in disagreement with experiment , and accordingly the @xmath37o(2 ) epr parameters are of the same order of magnitude as for @xmath37o(1);@xcite instead , when the hole localization is correctly captured , such as at the @xmath16level , the former are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the latter ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "secondly , the improvement of the isotropic part does not come along with a similar improvement of the anisotropic one , which indeed is related to the proper description of the @xmath1 hole wavefunction .",
    "the above conclusion is also supported by the computed superhyperfine matrix of @xmath38al : the @xmath16functional gives results in quantitative agreement with both experiment and uhf calculations,@xcite whereas this is not true for b3lyp .",
    "notice that the superhyperfine interaction with a dopant element like al that introduces a hole in the structure is usually the only accessible information .",
    "in fact , in order to measure the o hyperfine constants , @xmath37o enriched samples have to be prepared with complex and costly procedures.@xcite      the al impurity in quartz silica has been observed to act as a color center , endowing it with the typical smoky coloration .",
    "however , considerable controversy arose as to which absorption feature had to be correlated with such observation.@xcite it was finally concluded that an absorption peak at about 2.9  ev is to be associated with the presence of al centers and , thus , with the smoky coloring.@xcite    the observed optical transition should be related to excitation of the hole trapped at the neutral @xmath2}^0$]center ( @xmath40 ) into the vb , leading to a negatively charged defect ( @xmath41 , @xmath2}^{-1}$]center ) ; accordingly , from the theory side , the optical transition level @xmath42 is the relevant quantity to be compared with experiments .",
    "the @xmath16predicts the computed level to be @xmath43  ev above the valence band ( vb ) maximum , nearly 2  ev higher in the band gap than in experiments .",
    "we attribute this disagreement to the already mentioned overestimation of the electronic band gap of bulk quartz provided by @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the al - related defect level is wrongly positioned with respect to the vb ( @xmath44  ev above its edge ) and this eventually gives rise to the observed overestimation of the optical transition energy .    as a partial workaround ,",
    "we computed the electronic structure using the b3lyp functional , which yields a band gap of 8.6  ev for bulk quartz , falling in the range of the experimental values ; the @xmath2}^0$]geometry obtained within @xmath16was instead retained .",
    "the spin population and epr parameters computed following this approach are reported in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the hole is again localized on the o(1 ) atom , although with a mulliken density lower than that obtained by performing calculations fully within the @xmath16scheme .",
    "surprisingly , the computed hyperfine parameters are in even better quantitative agreement with experiments , as the lower spin density counterbalances the overestimation yielded by the @xmath16 ; a similar trend was noticed in the previous hybrid - functional investigation of to  _ _ et al.__@xcite the charge density distribution analysis for the negatively - charged center led us to conclude that the same qualitative picture is obtained at the @xmath16and b3lyp levels , provided that the geometry is kept fixed to the one optimized within @xmath16 : the one - particle state corresponding to vertical excitation of the hole to the vb is still contributed by the @xmath1 orbitals of the o(1 ) atom .",
    "the computed optical level for such transition is positioned at @xmath45  ev above the top of the vb , in excellent agreement with experiment . for comparison ,",
    "we report in table  [ tab3 ] representative results from previous theoretical studies for the computed vertical transition energy correlating with the experimentally found absorption band with a maximum at @xmath45  ev .",
    "we have re - investigated the long - standing problem of hole localization in al - doped quartz sio@xmath0 using a recently proposed hybrid - functional method in which the exchange fraction is consistently determined based on the analogy with the many - body cohsex approximation to the electron self - energy , without empirical prescriptions or fitting to the experimental data .",
    "the cohsex scheme is rigorously si - free , and thus constitutes the ideal starting point for studying systems in which incomplete cancellation of si leads to a qualitatively wrong ground state .",
    "the neutral al impurity in quartz silica is just a paradigmatic case : ( semi)local or standard hybrid dft functionals fail in capturing the experimentally evidenced hole localization at one of the al - coordinated o atoms.@xcite in particular , the failure of popular hybrid functionals , such as b3lyp , has been attributed to the insufficient amount of exx admixed .",
    "the @xmath16approach allows one to evaluate the exchange fraction from first - principles , based on a simple relationship with the macroscopic dielectric constant of the material . in the case of quartz silica",
    ", we obtained it to be @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting hybrid functional correctly reproduces the hole localization at a single o atom surrounding the al impurity , also giving an accurate description of the structural distortion around it , and allowing to compute epr parameters in agreement with previous si - free calculations@xcite and experiments.@xcite however , the defect - related optical spectroscopic features are not well - reproduced by the @xmath16method .",
    "we attribute this failure to the observed overestimation of the bulk quartz silica band gap . using b3lyp on top of the @xmath16optimized geometry yields a band structure in better agreement with experiment and",
    "corroborates this hypothesis .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the hybrid - functional approach tested in this work is capable of correcting most of the si error inherent to ( semi)local , as well as more popular hybrid , dft functionals .",
    "this feature is crucial for adequately describing the ground state of defective oxide materials .",
    "as far as defect - related excitation energies are concerned , their determination is subordinate to an accurate calculation of the electronic structure of the bulk material .",
    "this is not always the case for low - dielectric - constant insulators in general , and for quartz sio@xmath0 in particular .",
