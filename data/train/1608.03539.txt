    "a large fraction ( @xmath770% ) of local spiral and lenticular ( s0 ) disk galaxies contain non - axisymmetric stellar structures such as bars and spirals on scales of a few kiloparsecs which are believed to impact on the central stellar structures and non - stellar activities of the galaxies themselves ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ; knapen et al .",

    "high - resolution near - infrared and optical imaging of barred disk galaxies has revealed that such distinct small - scale ( @xmath8kpc ) structures can include bulges , nuclear star clusters , nuclear disks and rings , bars , dust disks and spirals ( e.g. , kormendy 1982 ) .",
    "theory predicts that a large - scale stellar bar drives gaseous material into the nuclear regions of the host galaxy .",
    "shlosman , frank & begelman ( 1989 ) proposed that double bars ( i.e. , bars within bars ) plus nuclear rings effectively remove angular momentum from the large - scale disk material , allowing for the transfer of gas ( and perhaps stars ) towards the central supermassive black hole .",
    "this bar - driven gas infall and the subsequent gas accumulation was proposed to account for the enhancement of nuclear starburst events and the slow buildup of the  pseudo - bulges \" in barred galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy 1982 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; athanassoula 1992 ; martin 1995 ; ho et al .  1997a ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; sheth et al.2005 ; athanassoula 2005 ; ann & thakur 2005 ; coelho & gadotti 2011 ; ellison et al .  2011 ) . nuclear stellar bars and/or spirals",

    "\\(2 ) an intermediate - scale disky ( @xmath138 ) component ( which we refer to as ` pseudo - bulge ' ) and a bulge coexist within ngc  3945 and ngc  4371 , confirming the conclusion of erwin et al .",
    "however , in contrast to past works we found that these pseudo - bulges follow a low @xmath163 ( @xmath141 ) srsic model profile instead of an exponential ( @xmath4 ) profile . fitting an exponential profile to what is actually a srsic profile with a low @xmath163 overestimates the luminosity and mass of the pseudo - bulge . the bulges of our three galaxies have srsic indices of @xmath177    \\(3 ) we have presented new fractional luminosities for the ( pseudo-)bulges and other model components of ngc  2681 , ngc  3945 and ngc  4371 .",
    "we found that the bulges of our galaxies are compact ( i.e. , half - light radii @xmath161 pc to 385.4 pc ) and have stellar masses of @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "\\(4 ) the nuclear regions of ngc  2681 , ngc  3945 and ngc  4371 lie well outside the pure star - forming galaxy zone in the bpt diagram . instead , ngc  2681 has liner - type emission inside @xmath5 but the emission lines due to star formation become increasingly significant when the aperture size is increased , consistent with the presence of the point source and nuclear bar in this galaxy .",
    "this trend is reversed for ngc 3945 and ngc  4371 where the contributions of the emission lines are dominated by the agn over @xmath133 .",
    "ngc  4371 has the weakest emission lines of the three galaxies .",
    "\\(5 ) our results suggest that the bulges of the three galaxies have formed via an earlier violent merging while the disks form over time through gas accretion and bar - driven perturbations could create pseudo - bulges , bars , rings and point sources .",
    "nested bars are common , with around one third of all barred galaxies containing at least one additional smaller bar , and in future work we will analyse more of such systems in order to categorise them in more detail , and compare them in detail with dynamical models .",
