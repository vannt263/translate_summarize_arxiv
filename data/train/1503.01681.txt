    "the idea that non - perturbative quantum gravity can `` cure '' ultraviolet divergences , including its own , dates back to the seventies @xcite , the idea was further developed by @xcite and very recently embodied in the so called `` uv self - complete quantum gravity '' by dvali and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the novelty of this approach consists in the assumption that planckian energy scattering will be dominated by the production of micro black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "so far , the paradigm of modern high - energy physics is that the energy of an accelerated particle allows to probe shorter and shorter distances without any lower bound .",
    "the present lhc peak energy , @xmath0 , set the experimental limit up to @xmath1 .",
    "hypothetically , an ultra - planckian particle accelerator would be even able to probe distances below @xmath2 .",
    "although there is no chance to build such a machine in a foreseeable future , the theoretical argument remains valid .",
    "+ nevertheless , if one considers the collision of two elementary particles with high enough center of mass energy and small impact parameter , a huge energy concentration would be reached requiring , according to uv self - complete quantum gravity hypothesis , a proper account of non - perturbative gravitational effects .",
    "such a situation is expected to lead to the creation of a micro bh , as a realization of the `` quantum hoop conjecture '' ( qhc ) .",
    "qhc extends the classical statement that a macroscopic object of arbitrary shape , of mass @xmath3 , passing through a ring of radius @xmath4 , will necessarily collapse into a bh @xcite . in the quantum case ,",
    "the macroscopic object is replaced by the target - projectile pair and the condition for a bh creation is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total center of mass energy of the colliding system , @xmath7 the gravitational coupling constant and @xmath8 is the impact parameter .",
    "thus , whenever the effective schwarzschild radius is lower or equal to the impact parameter , the bh production channel opens up .",
    "if planckian scattering regime is bh creation dominated @xcite , the idea higher - energy / shorter - distance needs a substantial revision @xcite .",
    "in other words , increasing @xmath6 instead of reaching lower and lower wavelengths , stops at the threshold of bh creation .",
    "any further energy increase leads to growing bhs , thus shielding distances below their horizon from experimental reach .",
    "+ this idea has been recently incorporated in the framework of large extra - dimension models , where quantum gravity effects are expected to be dominant around @xmath9 . in this scenario ",
    "@xmath10 bhs `` production is slightly above the lhc energy and hopefully reachable by the next generation particle colliders .",
    "far beyond this energy scale , contrary to the standard expectation , gravitational dynamics becomes classical again ( ' ' large bhs `` ) , thus ultra - planckian regime is unexpectedly dominated by _",
    "classical _ field configurations , i.e. ''  classicalons   @xcite .",
    "+ if minimal size bhs are to be produced , their length sale will serve a natural short - distance cut - off , i.e. a _ minimal length _ .",
    "the existence of a minimal length , @xmath11 , in the space - time fabric was also implied by different approaches to quantum gravity including string theory , loop quantum gravity , non - commutative geometry , etc . @xcite . from a conventional point of view , @xmath11 is identified with the planck length @xmath12 , but as described above could be lowered near @xmath10 scale . therefore , it can be expected that @xmath10 bhs should be sensible to the presence of @xmath11 . + in a series of papers we have given bh solutions naturally incorporating @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a parameter measuring the amount of coordinate non - commutativity at short distance . in other papers , @xmath11 was engraved in the space - time fabric through a @xmath15-product embedded into the very definition of the metric tensor @xmath16 , in terms of the vierbein field @xmath17 :    @xmath18    the latter approach faces the basic difficulty that any attempt to solve the einstein equations requires a truncated perturbative expansion in @xmath11 , leading to an effective field theory with derivative couplings of arbitrary order .",
    "the resulting feynman expansion still contains planar graphs which are divergent one by one , in spite of the presence of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is the consequence of the ( truncated ) perturbative treatment which changes the original meaning of @xmath11 from a natural uv cut - off into the ( dimensional ) strength of non - renormalizable derivative interactions .",
    "the difficulty with the perturbative treatment of the @xmath15-product can be summarized as follows : in spite of the presence of @xmath11 in the theory , some of the resulting feynman diagrams remain divergent . to have a genuine non - perturbative approach we argued that the effects of @xmath11 can be implemented correctly in general relativity by keeping the standard form of the einstein tensor in the l.h.s . of the field equations and introduce an energy - momentum tensor with a modified source @xcite . the resulting solution for _ neutral , non - rotating , _ bh exhibits :    *  _ regularity _ ",
    ", i.e. absence of curvature singularities ; * extremal configuration corresponding to a minimal size near @xmath11 .",
    "regularity is an immediate consequence of the presence of @xmath11 in the space - time geometry , while the existence of a minimal mass , extremal configuration , is a surprising property , at least from the point of view of the bh textbook solutions . + in the first part of this letter we present the regular schwarzschild solution that exhibits extremal configuration with radius @xmath19 .",
    "this is what one expects in a theory where distances below @xmath11 have no physical meaning .",
    "+ all up to day experiments indicate that @xmath20 , which means that minimal bhs created in a planckian collision , will be certainly quantum objects . thus ,",
    "neither classical nor semi - classical description are satisfactory and one should quantize bhs themselves .",
    "+ in the absence of a proper quantum mechanical description of bhs , we propose a quantization scheme based on the analogy with the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "this quantization scheme is discussed in section[[bohr ] ] , where we also provide a new formulation of qhc .",
    "finally , in section[[final ] ] we summarize the main results obtained .",
    "in this section we construct regular schwarzschild solution of the einstein equations , where the minimal length is dynamically induced , in a self - consistent way .",
    "+ we are looking for a static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat metric of the form    @xmath21    where , @xmath22 are standard polar coordinates and @xmath23 is the time measured by an asymptotic minkowskian observer .",
    "@xmath24 is an unknown function determined by the einstein equations once the source is given .",
    "an energy - momentum tensor compatible with the symmetry of the problem is the one of an anisotropic fluid :    @xmath25    in the chosen coordinate system @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the energy density , @xmath29 is the radial pressure and @xmath30 is the tangential pressure determined in terms of @xmath28 by the covariant divergence - free condition ( [ divfree ] ) . + from the einstein equations one finds    @xmath31    the textbook schwarzschild solution for a bh of mass m is obtained by the choice    @xmath32    which describes a _ point - like _ source . in our case",
    "we choose a smeared matter distribution given by a gaussian as :    @xmath33    where , @xmath3 is the total mass - energy of the system as measured by an asymptotic minkowskian observer :    @xmath34    this choice draws its motivation from the fact that in ordinary quantum mechanics the minimal uncertainty states , i.e. the closest states to a point - like object , are given by gaussian wave - packets . in the limit @xmath35",
    "the function ( [ ro ] ) goes into the singular density ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "+ by inserting ( [ ro ] ) in ( [ mradial ] ) we obtain    @xmath36    where the incomplete gamma function @xmath37 is defined as    @xmath38    as a consitency check , we showed the relation @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the arnowitt , deser , misner mass @xcite derived from the metric ( [ nostra ] ) .",
    "the calculation is straightforward and will be reproduced here .",
    "+ horizons correspond to the solutions of the equation    @xmath41    the equation ( [ plot ] ) can not be solved analytically as in the standard schwarzschild case , but by plotting the function @xmath42 one sees the existence of a pair of horizons , merging into a single , degenerate horizon at the minimum with estimated radius     plot of the mass @xmath3 as a function of the radius of the horizon . ,",
    "width=377 ]    @xmath43    neglecting the one per cent corrections , the minimum mass results to be    @xmath44    thus , for any @xmath45 the solution describes a _ non - extremal _ bh of radius @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath47 we have a _ minimal - size , extremal _ bh of radius @xmath11 which gives a physical meaning to the , up to now arbitrarily introduced , cut - off @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "the existence of a minimal length is a strict consequence of the existence of minimal size bh of the same radius .",
    "this goes under the name of _ self - regular _ bh meaning that the non - perturbative dynamics of gravity determines a natural cut - off , thus realizing the uv self - completeness hypothesis in this model .",
    "in this section we present a bohr - like quantization of bhs . for the sake of simplicity we limit ourselves to neutral objects only . + from the discussion regarding neutral bhs in the section ( [ neutral ] ) it results that quantum effects are dominant in the near extremal region where the behavior of the function @xmath48 significantly differs from the usual schwarzschild case . + we shall follow a bohr - like quantization scheme which does not require the knowledge of a full quantum gravity theory .",
    "the idea comes from the form of ( [ ro ] ) which is reminiscent of the ground - state for an isotropic , 3d , harmonic oscillator    @xmath49    where ,    @xmath50    is the ground state wave function @xcite .",
    "to relate the two different systems , i.e. our bh and the quantum harmonic oscillator , we establish a formal correspondence between the mass @xmath51 and the angular frequency @xmath52 with the corresponding quantities in ( [ ro ] )    @xmath53    in this identification the mass of the extremal bh represents the equivalent of the ground - state energy of the harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath54 is the zero - point energy    @xmath55    by solving the two equations ( [ omega ] ) , ( [ emme ] ) we find    @xmath56    the needs of bh mass quantization has been also recently stressed in @xcite .",
    "thus , we describe non - extremal bhs as  excited  energy states labeled by an integer _ principal quantum number _ @xmath57 as    @xmath58    due to the spherical symmetry only even oscillator states are allowed for the 3d , isotropic , harmonic oscillator . in this quantization scheme",
    "the extremal bh configuration with @xmath19 represents the _ zero - point energy _ of the gravitational system .",
    "the result can be interpreted as the realization of earlier attempts to dynamically generate a _",
    "zero - point length _ @xcite thus eliminating ultraviolet divergences through quantum fluctuations of gravity itself .",
    "+ following further analogy with bohr quantization , where the quantum / classical transition is achieved for large @xmath57 , we redefine a  quantum  mass / energy distribution which for large @xmath57 approaches a dirac delta sourcing a standard schwarzschild metric @xcite . in other words",
    ", we are adopting a kind of correspondence principle , _ a la _ bohr , applied to the matter energy density :    @xmath59 \\label{ron}\\ ] ]    notice that    @xmath60    leading to a standard schwazschild geometry .",
    "one may wonder why we do not push the analogy to an extreme and use the known excited state wave - functions of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we considered this approach but did not pursue it for the following reasons :    * we called our bh quantization conjecture  bohr - like  , in the same spirit in which old quantum mechanics was formulated before schroedinger , since there is no wave - equation for quantum bhs as there is for quantum harmonic oscillator . *",
    "even if one ignores the previous comment , the use of excited harmonic oscillator wave - functions leads to multi - horizon geometries with an increasing number of different extremal configurations .",
    "the resulting excited bhs have a geometrical structure completely different from the minimal size , self - regular , solution we started from .",
    "therefore , the `` quantized '' version of ( [ nostra ] ) reads     for @xmath61 .",
    "horizontal lines correspond to quantized mass levels .",
    ", width=377 ]    @xmath62/\\gamma(3/2 ) \\label{qmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    several comments are in order .",
    "+ first , due to the identification of the extremal bh with the @xmath63 state , we obtain the _ zero - point metric _ , with quantization picking up only the ground - state mass @xmath64 .",
    "+ second , the metric ( [ qmetric ] ) , for ``  large-@xmath57  '' reduces to the ordinary schwarzschild line element while still keeping a quantized mass spectrum .",
    "@xmath65    where , @xmath66 .",
    "this limit is due to the fact @xmath67 for @xmath57 large enough . as a matter of fact , already for @xmath68",
    "the metric ( [ large ] ) is a very good approximation of the exact quantum metric ( [ qmetric ] ) .",
    "the relative energy difference between nearby levels @xmath69 for @xmath70 and the mass spectrum becomes _ effectively _ continuous .",
    "+ two limiting cases are of particular interest : ground state @xmath63 , and the _ classical ( large bh ) _",
    "limit @xmath71 .",
    "+ on expects that the ground state of the system is only `` vacuum energy '' , i.e. that the extremal bh configuration is only a vacuum - fluctuation . from the effective geometry ( [ qmetric ] )",
    "one obtains the `` semi - classical '' horizon equation @xmath72    which we translate into a quantum framework as the equation for the average values of horizon radius in a given quantum state .",
    "we identify the trivial solution @xmath73 as the vacuum average value :    @xmath74    however , this vanishing mean value has an `` uncertainty '' :    @xmath75    by squaring ( [ reff ] ) we get the equation for the vacuum average of @xmath76 :    @xmath77 ^ 2 \\label{fluct}\\ ] ]    by taking into account the definition ( [ m0 ] ) of @xmath54 it is immediate to check that equation ( [ fluct ] ) is solved by    @xmath78    and @xmath79 . + in the large-@xmath57 limit equation ( [ reff ] ) reduces to the definition of the classical schwarzschild radius    @xmath80    and @xmath81    as it was expected , the extremal bh , corresponding to the zero - point energy of the system , is a pure quantum fluctuation , while highly excited states behave as `` classical '' objects ( @xmath82 ) described by an effective schwarzschild metric .",
    "thanks to the properties of the @xmath37-function , a good approximation of the full spectrum is    @xmath83      strictly speaking , the density ( [ ron ] ) is non - vanishing everywhere , even if it quickly drops to zero already at distances of few @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the skeptics may rise the question whether a bh can be formed at all by such a smeared distribution . in order to remove these doubts ,",
    "we evoke the classical _ hoop conjecture _ @xcite and adapt it to the present situation .",
    "first , we define a _",
    "mean radius _ of the mass distribution and the mean value of the square radius , as    @xmath84    secondly , we evaluate the mean square deviation as    @xmath85\\ ] ]    which vanishes for large @xmath57 : @xmath86 .",
    "+ finally , we define the quantum hoop conjecture as the condition that _ whenever the mean radius of the mass distribution is smaller that the mean value of the horizon radius , then a quantum bh forms_.    @xmath87    which leads to the relation    @xmath88   \\label{qhoop}\\ ] ]    it is sufficient to verify ( [ qhoop ] ) in the `` worst case scenario '' @xmath89 , which turns out to be satisfied . for larger @xmath57 the width of the gaussian distribution shrinks while the radius of the horizon increases , maintaining the qhc .",
    "in the first part of this letter we described a regular schwarzschild geometry , incorporating a `` minimal '' length @xmath11 which , due to gravitational quantum dynamics , turns out to be the radius of the minimal size extremal configuration . this solution is a first realization , within a specific model , of the uv self - complete quantum gravity program . in other words ,",
    "quantum gravity effects dynamically generate a short distance cut - off shielding the planck scale physics from experimental probe . in the last part of this work",
    ", we have proposed a bohr - like bh quantization scheme . for the sake of computational simplicity",
    ", we have described neutral quantum bhs .",
    "the generalization to charged bhs will follow the same pattern in a bit more technically involved manner .",
    "+ the main outcome of the proposed quantization scheme can be listed as :    * any phenomenon occurring at distances smaller than @xmath11 is not experimentally measurable .",
    "* the mass of the extremal configuration is equivalent to the zero - point energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator . *",
    "the non - extremal configurations corresponds to harmonic oscillators excited states , with a discrete mass spectrum of equally spaced levels . *",
    "the model satisfies a bohr - like correspondence principle for large @xmath57 , where it reproduces standard schwarzschild bh .",
    "* we also formulated a `` quantum hoop conjecture '' , which supports the existence of quantum bhs whenever the condition @xmath90 is met .",
    "* one may wonder what is the thermodynamics of quantum bhs .",
    "we believe that concepts like hawking temperature and bekenstein entropy refer to semi - classical bhs where mass and size are continuous variables .",
    "intrinsically quantum bhs do not radiate thermally being stationary state configurations .",
    "non - thermal quantum bhs have been recently discussed in @xcite . in the quantum phase absorption and emission",
    "proceed through discrete quantum jumps between different energy states , instead of emitting a continuous thermal spectrum .",
    "thus , there is no hawking radiation at the quantum level and bhs are just another kind of `` particle '' in the quantum zoo .",
