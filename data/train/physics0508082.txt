    "dilute atomic bose gases are simpler to describe than liquid helium , with many succesful implementations of mean - field theories .",
    "it is a purpose of this paper to present a simple model of superfluidity in a weakly interacting bose gas using the classical fields approximation .",
    "the classical fields approximation is the non - perturbative mean - field model of a bose - einstein condensate at finite temperatures .",
    "it turned out to be very successful in describing dynamical and thermodynamic properties of atomic condensates and their excitation spectra @xcite .",
    "it allows a description of the condensate and a thermal cloud treating both components on equal footing without any arbitrary splitting of the system into two parts .    in section [ the method ]",
    "we briefly describe the classical fields approximation . for ease of calculations",

    "the same scheme applied to a system with quantum corrections taken into consideration shows that even at zero temperature the superfluid fraction is @xmath122 even though the condensed fraction is smaller than that . because the quantum depletion originates from the reversed order of @xmath31 in the inverse bogoliubov transform , the formula for superfluid population takes the form :    @xmath123    whereas the total number of atoms is given by : @xmath124 in these formulas @xmath125 , @xmath126 and the quantum depletion @xmath127",
    "is accounted separately . at zero temperature , when @xmath128 , both @xmath78 and @xmath119 vanish and the superfluid population equals the total number of atoms in the system .",
    "even though such a basic model suffers from a divergence in quantum depletion terms resulting from the zero range potential , it clearly indicates that the quantum depletion belongs to the superfluid fraction .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model of superfluidity of a weakly - interacting bose gas within the classical fields approximation . in the direct numerical simulation of the dynamics",
    "we have shown that below the landau critical velocity @xmath45 the relative flow of the condensate with respect to the thermal cloud is superfluid and that the resulting state is in a thermal equilibrium .",
    "the relative velocity of this superflow is an additional control parameter characterizing the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the superfluid fraction has been identified from the momentum transformation rules and an application of the landau criterion .",
    "it turns out to be the condensate plus atoms from the excited modes which do not participate in the collective excitations of the system .",
    "these atoms can be viewed as bound to the condensate by the interactions .",
    "the results provide analitical formula for a difference between superfluid and condensed parts at any temperature and within a consistent and non - perturbative description .",
    "they also show that one does not require a strongly - interacting helium - ii , with its roton part of the spectrum and essential many - body interactions , to make this difference significant .    in our approach",
    "it is also evident that quantum depletion occuring in a weakly - interacting bose gas is also a part of the superfluid fraction , so that even at @xmath129 there is a difference between superfluid and condensed fractions - again similarly to he - ii .",
