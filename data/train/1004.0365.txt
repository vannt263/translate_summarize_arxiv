    "note first that the constrained voter model is obtained from the two - feature two - state axelrod model by identifying two cultures without common feature with the centrist opinion , and each of the other two cultures with the leftist and rightist opinions , respectively .",
    "therefore the mean cluster size is stochastically larger for the constrained voter model than the axelrod model , so it suffices to prove the result for the latter . to study the probability of a consensus when @xmath36 but also the expected number of cultural domains at equilibrium when @xmath33 in the next section , the idea is to analyze the evolution of the agreements along the edges rather than the actual opinion at each vertex .",
    "the network can be viewed as a weighted graph where each edge is assigned a weight that counts the number of features its endpoints have in common .",

    "the former follows from the clustering of a certain voter model coupled with the axelrod model , while the latter follows from the combination of clustering and a certain recurrence property of the voter model . before going into the details of the proof",
    ", we start by collecting important results about the connection between the axelrod model , the voter model and coalescing random walks .",
    "the first ingredient is to observe , as pointed out by vzquez and redner @xcite , that one recovers the voter model from the two - feature two - state axelrod model by identifying cultures that have no feature in common . indeed , when @xmath36 , we have @xmath41.\\ ] ] therefore , letting @xmath42 for all @xmath43 and noticing that @xmath44 we obtain that @xmath45 is the markov process with generator @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the configuration defined by @xmath48 this indicates that the process @xmath45 is a time - change of the voter model run at rate @xmath49 , but since we are only interested in the limiting distribution of the axelrod model , we shall for simplicity speed up time by a factor two in order to get the usual voter model run at rate 1 .",
    "the voter model can be constructed graphically using an idea of harris @xcite , which also allows to exhibit a duality relationship between the voter model and coalescing random walks .",
    "this construction is now standard so we only give a brief description . to each vertex @xmath43 , we attach a poisson process with parameter one .",
    "then , at the arrival times of this process , we choose one of the two neighbors @xmath50 uniformly at random , then draw an arrow from vertex @xmath50 to vertex @xmath3 and put a @xmath51 at @xmath3 to indicate that @xmath3 updates its opinion by mimicking @xmath50 .",
    "the connection between the voter model and coalescing random walks appears when keeping track of the ancestry of each vertex going backwards in time which also defines the so - called dual process .",
    "we say that there is a dual path from @xmath52 to @xmath53 if there are sequences of times and vertices @xmath54 such that the following two conditions hold :      then , for @xmath61 finite , the dual process starting at @xmath62 is the set - valued process @xmath63 the dual process is naturally defined only for dual times @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is convenient to assume that the poisson processes in the graphical representation are also defined for negative times so that the dual process can be defined for all @xmath65 .",
    "the reason for introducing the dual process is that it allows one to deduce the state of the process at the current time from the configuration at earlier times based on the duality relationship @xmath66 moreover , it can be seen from the graphical representation that the dual process evolves according to a system of simple symmetric coalescing random walks that jump at rate 1 , so questions about the voter model can be answered by looking at this system of coalescing random walks .",
    "clifford and sudbury @xcite and holley and liggett @xcite proved independently that the @xmath67-dimensional voter model clusters if and only if @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , for all @xmath37 , @xmath69 which establishes extinction of the 1-edges .",
    "+   + to second step is to prove that there is extinction of the 0-edges , which follows from the combination of clustering and a certain recurrence property of the one - dimensional voter model . here , by recurrence of the voter model ,",
    "we mean that @xmath70 note that this notion of recurrence should not be confused with the notion of recurrence of a connected graph . indeed , whereas polya s theorem indicates that the @xmath67-dimensional regular lattice is recurrent if and only if @xmath68 , the law of large number for the occupation time of the voter model established in cox and griffeath @xcite implies that the voter model is recurrent in @xmath71 .",
    "recurrence of the one - dimensional voter model and extinction of the 0-edges rely on a series of technical lemmas .",
    "first of all , to avoid cumbersome notations , we shall only prove that the opinion of vertex 0 switches infinitely often and invoke translation invariance of the evolution rules to deduce that the voter model is recurrent .",
    "let @xmath72 , and define @xmath73 as well as the spatial and space - time regions ( see figure [ fig : regions ] ) @xmath74 then , we let @xmath75 denote the dual random walk starting at @xmath76 .",
    "recurrence of the voter model will follow from the duality relationship by proving that there is almost surely an infinite subsequence of random walks starting at vertex 0 that do not coalesce by time 0 .",
    "first , we observe that the probability to be estimated is bounded from above by the probability that the random walk performs at least @xmath80 jumps in @xmath81 units of time .",
    "since jumps occur at the times of a poisson process with parameter one , letting @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 from standard large deviation estimates for the poisson random variable .",
    "since all the paths connecting a vertex in @xmath92 to a vertex outside @xmath93 have uniformly at least @xmath94 edges , the arguments of lemma [ close ] imply that @xmath95 combining the previous inequality with lemmas [ close ] and [ far ] gives @xmath96 provided @xmath85 is sufficiently large .",

    "note also that the culture at vertex @xmath3 can not be updated as long as none of the edges incident to @xmath3 has weight 1 .",
    "roughly speaking , thinking of the middle point of an edge of type @xmath112 , as being occupied by a type @xmath38 particle , we obtain an interacting particle system in which particles of type 1 evolve according to a system of annihilating random walks and the collision of two type 1 particles may or may not result in a type 0 particle .",
    "in addition , when a type 1 jumps onto a type 0 , type 0 is killed .",

    "note however that the edge weight now ranges from zero to @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , since we now assume that the network of interactions is finite , the process reaches almost surely an absorbing state , that is any configuration in which each edge has either weight zero or weight @xmath5 .",
    "looking at the cultural dynamics on a path - like graph , the ultimate number of cultural domains is nearly equal to the ultimate number of edges with weight zero , so the strategy is to bound from below the number of such edges .",

    "the next lemma gives the connected between the ultimate number of cultural domains and the ultimate number of 0-edges , which holds on a path and more generally a finite tree .",
    "the number @xmath27 of cultural domains at time @xmath9 is the number of connected components of the graph obtained by removing all edges whose weight at time @xmath9 differs from @xmath5 . in the case of a finite tree , this results in a forest whose number of connected components is equal to the number of edges removed plus one , from which it follows that @xmath132 since the axelrod model on a finite graph converges to one of its absorbing states and that each absorbing state is characterized by all the edges having weight either 0 or @xmath5 , we also have @xmath133 the result follows .",
