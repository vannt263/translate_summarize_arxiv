    "as known , a pure state of two particles is entangled if its bipartite wave function can not be factorized , i.e. , presented in the form of a product of two single - particle functions , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are variables or sets of variables of two particles .",
    "a natural extension of this definition is given by the schmidt decomposition , or schmidt theorem @xcite , according to which any entangled , unfactorable , bipartite wave function can be presented as a sum of factorized terms @xmath9 the orthogonal and normalized functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the schmidt modes defined as eigenfunctions of the reduced density matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are defined in their turn as partial traces of the full density matrix @xmath14 over @xmath8 ( for @xmath15 ) or over @xmath8 ( for @xmath16 ) ; @xmath17 denotes coinciding eigenvalues of both reduced density matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath18 the amount of efficiently populated schmidt modes in the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidt - modes ] ) characterizes the degree of entanglement and can be evaluated by the schmidt parameter @xmath19 for shortening formulations , let us refer the characterization of entanglement by the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidt - modes ] ) and the schmidt parameter @xmath1 ( [ k ] ) as the schmidt entanglement . note also that the schmidt decomposition and the definition of the schmidt parameter ( [ k ] ) are valid equally for bipartite systems with either discrete or continuous variables @xmath20 .",
    "it is rather important to analyze the relation of these definitions with those arising in the occupation - number representation of bipartite states . in the occupation - number representation",
    ", states are characterized by modes @xmath21 , and numbers of particles in these modes , @xmath22 . in the case of bipartite states @xmath23 .",
    "each specific distribution of particle occupation numbers in modes can be referred to as a configuration and denoted as @xmath24 .",
    "the bipartite density matrix in the representation of occupation numbers is defined by its matrix elements @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", each particle has its  coordinate@xmath26 , or sets of coordinates , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , correspondingly , for particles 1 and 2 .",
    "coordinate matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath27 between the coordinate eigenstates detrmine the coordinate density matrix @xmath28 .",
    "the sets of states @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equally complete , and there is the following relation between the density matrix in the coordinate and occupation - number representations @xmath31 the transformation coefficients have sense of the bipartite coordinate wave functions for given configurations @xmath32 in the case of distinguishable particles , the given - configuration wave functions ( [ conf - wf ] ) are always factorized , and the schmidt entanglement can arise only if the sum over configurations in eq .",
    "( [ dens - matr - multimode ] ) contains more than one term .",
    "this case can be referred to as corresponding to the configuration entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of indistinguishable particles , the given - configuration wave functions ( [ conf - wf ] ) must be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the variable transpositions ( correspondingly , in the cases of two - bozon or two - fermion states ) .",
    "some of such symmetrized given - configuration wave functions consist of two terms each , and in such cases the schmidt entanglement can arise even if the sum in eq .",
    "( [ dens - matr - multimode ] ) contains only one term .",
    "this is the case of the symmetry entanglement . in a general case of multiconfigurational states of indistinguishable particles ,",
    "the schmidt entanglement is determined by an unseparable superposition of the configurational and symmetry types of entanglement .",
    "thus , the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidt - modes ] ) and parameter @xmath1 ( [ k ] ) characterize the total amount of entanglement in a pure bipartite state with both configurational and symmetry parts of entanglement completely taken into account .",
    "a simple example of these definitions is the polarization state of two photons with different polarizations , horizontal ( @xmath33 ) and vertical ( @xmath34 ) ones , and with the state vector and the density - matrix operator given by @xmath35 modes of this state are @xmath33 and @xmath34 and this is a single - configurational state with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the state ( [ hv ] ) does not have the configurational entanglement .",
    "for this reason it s often said that the state @xmath38 is not entangled at all ( see .",
    "e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . but the discussion given above indicates clearly that this is not so because photons are indistinguishable bozon particles , and their symmetrized wave functions ( [ conf - wf ] ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the only given configuration ( [ hv ] ) consist of two terms each @xmath41 and the same for @xmath42 . here and",
    "below we use notations @xmath43 for polarization variables instead of @xmath20 in eqs .",
    "( [ schr ] ) , ( [ schmidt - modes ] ) and ( [ dens - matr - multimode ] ) , ( [ conf - wf ] ) . note also , that , in contrast to distinguishable particles , in the case of indistinguishable particles ( photons ) the variables @xmath44 and @xmath44 are not associated with any specific particle , they have to be interpreted as the polarization variables of one and another of two photons , never known specifically which one of them .",
    "also , these variables are not associated with specific modes .",
    "e.g. , as seen well from eq .",
    "( [ conf - wf - hv ] ) , the variable @xmath45 can be related either to the mode @xmath33 or @xmath34 . in this sense variables and modes",
    "are entangled , which means that there is no one - to - one correspondence between variables and modes . in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ dens - matr - multimode ] ) and results of ref .",
    "@xcite , symmetry of the wave function @xmath39 ( [ conf - wf - hv ] ) provides entanglement of the state @xmath38 evaluated via the schmidt decomposition and schmidt parameter @xmath1 , or concurrence @xmath0 .",
    "this result agrees also with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite .    however , the same state as given by eq .",
    "( [ hv ] ) in the basis with horizontal and vertical axes @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , in the basis turned for @xmath48 takes the form @xmath49 two modes correspond now to photon polarizations along the @xmath48- and @xmath50-axes , and , obviously , the state ( [ 45 - 135 ] ) is a two - configurational one .",

    "hence , in the basis ( @xmath55 ) the schmidt entanglement arises only owing to configurational entanglement , but both the degree of entanglement evaluated by the schmidt parameter @xmath1 , and the schmidt modes remain the same as found in the basis ( @xmath56 ) . thus , with changing bases , symmetry and configurational entanglement of pure polarization biphoton states are transformed into each other . in extreme cases of the bases ( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath55 )",
    "one of these two types of entanglement completely disappears . in all intermediate cases ( @xmath57 ) both types of entanglement",
    "exist and have to be taken into account together .",
    "the schmidt decomposition , schmidt modes , and the schmidt parameter @xmath1 characterize the total entanglement with both the symmetry and configurational contributions taken into account , and this makes the total entanglement basis - independent ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the total entanglement is the entanglement of a state as a whole , independent of conditions of its measurement or methods of its theoretical description .    one general remark more concerns spacial separation of indistinguishable particles , which is considered sometimes as partially diminishing their indistinguishability , making particles as if somewhat distinguishable .",
    "in the frame of such approach indistinguishable particles are assumed to get some features distinguishing them , e.g. , as photons propagating to the left and to the right , with left- and right - propagating photons treated as usual distinguishable particles .",
    "then , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ dens - matr - multimode ] ) , only configurational entanglement is taken into account .",
    "in fact , such procedures are insufficient for finding total entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles .",
    "actually , any kind of a spacial separation creates a new degree of freedom for particles , but particles themselves remain indistinguishable .",
    "bipartite states with several degrees of freedom ( e.g. , polarizations and propagation angles of photons or polarization and frequencies ) are more complicated , and have a higher dimensionality than states with one degree of freedom ( purely polarization biphoton states ) .",
    "polarization - frequency or polarization - angle ququarts are considered usually as two - qubit states , in which frequencies ( or propagation angles ) of photons are assumed to be strictly related to their variables , and symmetry of the wave function is not taken into account @xcite . in terms of discussed above configurational and symmetry entanglement , the two - qubit model of biphoton ququarts describes only the configurational entanglement and ignores the symmetry entanglement inevitably occurring in the case of indistinguishable particles .",
    "though such approach can be reasonable in some cases , as said above , it is insufficient for evaluation of the total entanglement of biphoton ququarts .",
    "the approach appropriate for evaluation of the total entanglement was suggested in our work @xcite . in this approach",
    "biphoton polarization - frequency ququarts are considered as _ two - qudit _ states with the dimensionality of the one - photon hilbert space @xmath59 .",
    "their wave function is symmetric with respect to the transposition of photons , and their entanglement is a combination of the polarization and frequency entanglement , as well as a combination of the configuration and symmetry entanglement .",
    "features of frequency - polarization two - qudit biphoton ququarts are reminded briefly below in section * ii*. in section * iii * we discuss a representation of a general ququart s wave function in the form of sums of _ double - bell _ states , where  double - bell@xmath26 means a product of , e.g. , polarization and frequency bell states . in sections * iv * and * v * we describe mixed biphoton states with ",
    "invisible@xmath26 variables which arise from biphoton ququarts after averaging over either frequency or polarization variables . in experiment",
    "this corresponds to the situation when experimenters use detectors unsensitive either to values of frequencies of photons or to their polarizations , which makes these variable effectively invisible .",
    "features of the arising two - frequency or two - polarization mixed states are rather unusual .",
    "we find explicitly their schmidt parameter @xmath1 , concurrence @xmath0 , von neumann mutual information @xmath3 and , in some simple cases , their relative entropy @xmath60 and the degree of classical correlations @xmath5 .",
    "for biphoton mixed polarization states we find a universal relation between their degree of polarization and the schmidt parameter @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", we find that in the case of mixed polarization states the schmidt parameter @xmath1 does not characterize anymore their degree of entanglement as it does in the case pure bipartite states . at last , in section",
    "* vi * we discuss in more details a relationship between features of polarization biphoton ququarts with invisible frequency variables and of two - qubit ququarts with asymmetric wave functions and photon frequencies not considered as variables at all .",
    "we discuss experimental schemes in which biphoton polarization - frequency ququarts can display either features of full - dimensionality two - dudit states , or of a two - qubit model , or of mixed polarization states averaged over frequencies .",
    "biphoton ququarts can be produced , e.g. , in collinear non - degenerate spdc processes [ two possible frequencies , @xmath61 ( high , @xmath62 ) or @xmath63 ( low , @xmath64 ) and one of two polarizations for each photon , horizonal ( @xmath33 ) and vertical ( @xmath34 ) ] . to get ququarts of a general form , on can use more than one nonlinear birefringent crystal and/or additional manipulations with photon polarizations after crystals .",
    "given frequencies of photons in spdc pairs ( @xmath61 and @xmath63 ) can be obtained either with the help of frequency filters or in the approximation of a highly monochromatic pump and a very long crystal . in such schemes , polarizations and frequencies of photons",
    "are two independent degrees of freedom , and the corresponding variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) can take two values each for each photon , @xmath68 or @xmath34 and @xmath69 or @xmath63 .",
