    "in contrast to the bipartite case , there is no need for the set of vectors @xmath23 in   to form an orthogonal ( or even linearly independent ) set of vectors in @xmath24 .",

    "now , let us state a direct corollary of the statement above .",
    "consider an operator of the form @xmath260 with @xmath261 being a set of orthonormal vectors in @xmath262 .",
    "suppose that @xmath257 is the sqe-@xmath20 solution of the projection @xmath263 corresponding to sqe-@xmath20 eigenvalue @xmath264 within some @xmath265-partition @xmath266 .",
    "this operator can be purified to a @xmath5-partite test operator @xmath117 , using a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath267 being elements of the hilbert space @xmath268 , as @xmath269 the sqe-@xmath20 solution of @xmath117 within the @xmath5-partition @xmath270 can be constructed using the following procedure :    a.   consider a @xmath271-partition of the integer @xmath20  such that @xmath272 and @xmath273  and denote the set of all such @xmath271-partitions as @xmath274 .",
    "find the corresponding sqe-@xmath95 eigenvectors of @xmath275 for all elements in @xmath276 , namely @xmath277 , as given in eq .  .",
    "note that the index @xmath278 can not be repeated .",
    "b.   write the sqe-@xmath20 solution , for all @xmath271-partitions in @xmath276 , in the form @xmath279 . c.   considering the relation   gives the corresponding sqe-@xmath20 eigenvalue as @xmath280    the proof is as follows .",
    "it is easy to check that the outcome of the construction process above is a solution of the sqe-@xmath20 eigenvalue problem for the test operator in eq .  .",
    "it is also clear that within @xmath281 and @xmath282 the sets @xmath267 and @xmath261 are optimal , because the operator @xmath117 is partially diagonalized with respect to these parties .",
    "therefore , decomposition   for @xmath74 must contain vector components from these two sets for @xmath281 and @xmath282 parties .",
    "now , from eq .  , if we choose the solution to contain a vector from @xmath261 , it should be accompanied with a sqe-@xmath95 solution for @xmath263 .    the procedure given above",
    "can be applied to an operator of the form @xmath283 if all the @xmath284 vectors are orthogonal and we need a sqe-@xmath20 eigenvector of @xmath117 with @xmath285 .",
    "the claim is as before , except that when @xmath286 , one can not state that the solution should contain vectors from @xmath281 and the set @xmath267 .",
    "however , due to the optimality of the set @xmath267 for the purification procedure , when @xmath285 , then , the solution must contain at least one of the vectors from this set .",
    "in the following , we are about to solve the set of sqe eigenvalue equations for the test operator of the form @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being a @xmath0-cluster state , @xmath287 which is a linear combination of product states of four qubit systems . here ,",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 are eigenvectors of the pauli operator @xmath78 and @xmath288 .",
    "first , we define the following partitions : @xmath289 where the symbol  @xmath290  denotes an equivalent partition  possibly by local flip operations @xmath291 or hadamard gates @xmath292  for the given symmetries of the state .",
    "note that in the trivial one - partition , @xmath293 , the sqe eigenvalue equation correspond to the standard eigenvalue problem having the eigenvalue @xmath294 .",
    "any @xmath82-partition problem is equivalent to the bipartite schmidt number problem , which can be handled according to the approach in ref .",
    "however , we may use the approach in  .",
    "in particular , the bipartition @xmath295 refers to the possibility of considering the schmidt decomposition between the hilbert space @xmath296 and the hilbert space @xmath297 , @xmath298 allowing a rank @xmath299 with locally orthonormal vectors .",
    "this results in @xmath300 and @xmath301 for @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "analogously , we have for @xmath304 @xmath305 for a rank @xmath299 , with @xmath300 and @xmath301 , and for @xmath83 , @xmath306 we have @xmath307 , with @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 , and @xmath311 .      for the partitioning @xmath313 we can decompose the state as @xmath314 having a ghz - type structure of two qutrits , which yields @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "in case of @xmath315 we decompose the state  ordered as @xmath316  as follows @xmath317 which is in the form of  .",
    "applying the solution in  , we get @xmath318 for @xmath125 . to show that these are the optimal eigenvalues",
    ", we calculate the reduced operator @xmath319 , @xmath320 which represents a separable bipartite operator .",
    "therefore , the eigenvectors of @xmath319 have the form @xmath321 .",
    "accordingly , the sqe spectrum of @xmath319 can be split into @xmath5 parts through the purification by a set of @xmath5 orthonormal vectors . in this case , this set is given by @xmath322 .",
    "for the @xmath312-partition @xmath323 the sqe-@xmath324 eigenvalue can be simply obtained using the cascade structure given in sec .",
    "[ casstr ] , as @xmath308 . also for sqe-@xmath82 , @xmath312 and @xmath0",
    ", we may simply apply the structure of eq .   to get the eigenvalues of @xmath318 for @xmath325 . for the @xmath0-partition @xmath326 ,",
    "the reduced operator with respect to the first party , @xmath327 , is of the form given in eq .",
    "leading to the same values for @xmath71 .",
