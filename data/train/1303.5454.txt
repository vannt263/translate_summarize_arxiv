    "recently , @xcite performed a model of the @xmath22-lc consisting of the emission from the outbursting wd , its m - giant companion and the nebulae . using the model lc , they specified new values of reddening @xmath23mag and distance @xmath24kpc .    during the flat maximum , an atmospheric model for @xmath25k matches",

    "the orbital period of the v723  cas binary was determined by @xcite to 16.6 h. the very slow evolution was also pointed by @xcite , who found that v723  cas was active x - ray source more than 12 years after outburst .",
    "another signature of such behaviour was revealed by @xcite , who found that the post - eruption lc ( @xmath42 ) is brighter by @xmath43mag than before the eruption .",
    "the model seds performed during the same period of the lc - evolution are very similar to those of pu  vul ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "during the optical maximum ( 1995 december 16 ) the wd s pseudophotosphere was as large as @xmath44@xmath29   and radiated at @xmath45k , which corresponds to a super - eddington luminosity @xmath46@xmath27  ( @xmath47kpc , @xmath48mag ) .",
