    "collective behavior in a population of individuals is of great importance in many areas of physics , biology , social sciences and many other disciplines@xcite .",
    "one of the most celebrated collective behaviors is the case of phase synchronization among a population of interacting self - sustained oscillators , in which all members tend to oscillate coherently with more or less the same phase .",
    "a population of coupled phase oscillators with mutual sine interaction between the pairs , is known as the _ kuramoto model _  @xcite .",
    "this model is introduced by kuramoto  @xcite and has extensively been investigated by many authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    considering a network of coupled rotors ( phase oscillators )",
    ", many factors such as coupling strength@xcite , time delayed interactions @xcite , individual frequency distribution@xcite , topology of network @xcite and noises@xcite , affect the path toward the full synchronization .",
    "the synchronization of the deterministic kuramoto model with random distribution of rotor frequencies and initial phases , has been studied on the scale - free networks by moreno and pacheco @xcite .",
    "there , it has been shown that the onset of synchronization occurs through a continuous transition at a small value of coupling with a critical exponent near @xmath0 .",
    "this resembles the mean - field behaviour , except that in the case of scale - free networks the critical coupling at which the rotors begin to get synchronized , is much smaller respect to all - to - all networks .",
    "they have also managed to find that in the complete synchronized state , dependence of the recovery time respect to the node degree is a power law function with exponent close to -1 , which shows the robustness of highly connected nodes ( hubs ) against perturbations .",
    "the comparison between the synchronizability of the kuramoto model on erds - rnyi(er ) and scale - free networks has been carried out recently by gomz - garde _ et al _ @xcite . in these references , the authors have found that while the onset of global synchronization occurs at smaller value of coupling for the scale - free networks , but tendency toward the global coherence grows suddenly to larger extends for er networks , at higher couplings .",
    "the reason for such behaviour is that the giant cluster in the heterogeneous networks ( such as scale - free networks ) , originating from a central core of high connectivity ( hub ) , grows continuously by attaching the smaller clusters to it upon increasing the coupling constant .",
    "in contrast , for the homogeneous networks , the evolution toward full synchronization would be boosted up by merging many small clusters spreading uniformly though out the networks , when the coupling is large enough .    in this paper",
    "our focus is on the effect of white noise forcing on the synchronization of kuramoto model for two types of networks : scale - free networks introduced by barabsi and albert(ba )  @xcite and random networks@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the stochastic kuramoto model and express briefly some results for all - to - all networks , section iii , is devoted to the simulation results and the conclusion will be presented in section iv .",
    "consider a system composed of @xmath1 rotors with the intrinsic frequencies , denoted by @xmath2 , on the top of a complex network consisting of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "the stochastic kuramoto model on such a network is described by the following set of equations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the phase of the rotor on the node @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the coupling constant and @xmath7 is an element of the connectivity matrix , which takes the value @xmath8 if @xmath5 and @xmath9 are linked together and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "@xmath11 is the random force applying on the @xmath5-th rotor , and usually is chosen as a white noise with zero mean - value .",
    "the spatial - temporal correlation of such a noise is given by :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is variance of the noise .",
    "the stochastic kuramoto model on an all - to - all network has been investigated analytically by acebrn _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who have shown that taking a one peaked symmetrical frequency distribution @xmath14 for oscillators , there would be a critical coupling constant @xmath15 $ ] above which the network begins to get synchronized .",
    "near this critical point , the order parameter obeys a power law relation , namely @xmath16 they have also shown that for a lorentzian frequency distribution @xmath17 , the incoherent solution is linearly stable for points @xmath18 above the critical line @xmath19 . in terms of coupling strength , this is also linearly stable for @xmath20 .    in the next section",
    "we numerically integrate eq.([kuramoto ] ) on scale - free and random networks and compare the results .",
    "to create a scale - free network with average connectivity @xmath21 , we use the ba algorithm @xcite . in this procedure , starting from @xmath22 initial nodes all connected to each other , at each step one attaches a newly entering node to @xmath23 elder ones such that the nodes with higher connectivity have larger probability ( proportional to their degree ) to get connected with this new one .",
    "repeating this stages provides us with a network whose degree distribution obeys a power law function as @xmath24 with @xmath25 . for producing er network composed of @xmath1 nodes and with the same average degree per node(@xmath26 ) , it is enough to distribute @xmath27 edges between randomly chosen pair of nodes@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we set @xmath28 and select a delta function distribution for intrinsic frequencies , @xmath29 . changing the reference frame to a rotating one with rotation frequency @xmath30 ,",
    "enable us to set @xmath31 for all rotors in eq.([kuramoto ] ) .",
    "we also pick @xmath32 out of a box distribution in the interval @xmath33 , hence its variance is given by @xmath34 .",
    "using ito s formalism for integration of a stochastic function@xcite , one obtains the following discrete equation from eq.([kuramoto ] ) :    @xmath35dt+\\eta_i(t)\\sqrt{dt}+o(dt^2),\\ ] ]    where in the ito s picture , @xmath32 is evaluated at the initial point of the time interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "time step , @xmath37 , is taken small enough to reduce the computational error .",
    "the initial values of @xmath4 are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath38 $ ] . to characterize the global phase coherency",
    ", we define the following order parameter : @xmath39 which @xmath40 means the averaging over different realizations of noise and initial conditions . in the stationary regime",
    "the time argument of @xmath41 can be omitted and one can replace the averaging over realizations by time averaging .",
    "the order parameter takes the value @xmath42 , where @xmath43 corresponds to the disordered phase and @xmath44 characterizes the full synchronized state .    in the absence of noise for scale - free network",
    ", we found that the rotors get synchronized for a very small value of coupling around @xmath45 .",
    "we choose a large enough value for the coupling to make sure that the system is in the full synchronized state when the noise is turned off , then increase the noise intensity until the global coherency vanishes at the critical value of the noise strength , @xmath46 .",
    "in addition to the order parameter @xmath47 , for better specifying the transition from coherency to decoherency , we introduce the binder s forth cumulant which is defined as :    @xmath48    it is easy to see that in coherent phase , where @xmath49 is nonzero , @xmath50 takes the value @xmath51 in the large @xmath1 limit , while upon vanishing the global synchronization(@xmath49=0 ) this quantity falls down to @xmath52 in thermodynamic limit .",
    "the much smaller numerical errors in computation of the binder s forth cumulant rather than the order parameter , makes it more advantageous for determination of the position and treatment of the coherency - decoherency phase transition .",
    "figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] represent the time dependence of order parameter for scale - free and random networks composed of @xmath53 rotors , respectively .",
    "to derive these data , we put @xmath54 , @xmath55 and averagings have carried out over 100 different realizations of noise and initial phase configurations , for the noise intensities increasing from @xmath56 by step @xmath57 . from these figures",
    ", one finds that after about 500 time steps the system reaches the stationary for all noise intensities , and obviously the global coherency vanishes at larger coupling values for the scale - free network ( around @xmath58 ) respect to the random network ( around @xmath59 ) .    in what follows , to find the dependence of the order parameter as well as binder s forth",
    "cumulant on the noise intensity , we fix the number of nodes to @xmath53 , and the averagings are carried on @xmath60 time steps after skipping @xmath61 initial steps , where the system is surely in the stationary state .    in figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we have depicted the order parameter , @xmath47 , versus the noise intensity , @xmath62 , for scale - free and random networks , for three coupling constants @xmath63 .",
    "similar graphs for the binder s forth cumulant , @xmath50 , is represented in figs.[fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .    for comparison ,",
    "the noise intensity variations of @xmath47 and @xmath50 have been depicted for both scale - free and random networks in figs.7a and 7b .    by inspecting these figures",
    "one can extract two essential results : + ( i ) synchronizability of each kind of networks depends on the coupling strength , such that at small noise intensities the order parameter for random network falls more slowly than scale - free s , so it is more robust than sf network against the noise while at large noise intensities the situation is vice versa ( see fig.7a ) .",
    "the critical noise intensity ( @xmath46 ) at which the transition from synchronized to un - synchronized state occurs is larger for the scale - free network .",
    "so the coherent state in sf network persists more against the noise than the random network with the same average degree and coupling constant .",
    "+ ( ii ) the coherency among the population of rotors destroys smoothly by increasing the noise intensity in the scale - free networks , while in the random networks the synchronization disappears by a sudden fall at the transition point .",
    "these behaviours are more apparent from the treatment of binder s forth cumulant shown in figs.[fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and 7b .",
    "then the order - disorder transition in sf networks resembles the continuous transitions in equilibrium critical phenomena , while the transition in random networks is discontinuous - like .    referring to gomz - gardees _ _ et al__@xcite , a nice explanation of our results are as follows . in homogeneous systems such as random networks , starting from the fully synchronized phase , when we turn on the noise , some incoherent clusters with more or less the same size begin to form . at low noise intensities ,",
    "the size of these clusters are small and they are well separated , but by increasing the noise they get larger and connected to each other at intermediate noise intensities . at this point ,",
    "the locally synchronized regions are not coherent anymore , so a big drop occurs for the order parameter .",
    "this is much like the first order phase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics , where the ordered and disordered phases coexist at the transition point . on the other hand ,",
    "the fully coherent state in the sf networks is founded around a core consists of nodes with high connectivity ( hubs ) . when noise is applied on such state",
    ", the un - synchronized parts leave this giant cluster one by one , leading to continuous destruction of global coherency .",
    "in summary , we numerically investigated the stability of the global phase synchronized state in kuramoto model on the top of scale - free and random networks , under white noise forcing on each oscillator .",
    "our results emphasize on the fact that the stability of the synchronized phase is dependent on the noise strength , such that at low noise intensities the random networks are more stable against loosing the coherency , while at intermediate noise intensities , the coherency falls abruptly in such networks .",
    "however , in scale - free networks the coherency among the rotors decreases smoothly and also persists up to larger extends of noise intensity .",
    "therefore , our findings confirm the picture presented by gomz - gardees _ _ et al__@xcite , that in heterogeneous networks the giant cluster formed around a core of hubs , grows ( falls ) continuously by increasing ( decreasing ) the coupling or by lowering ( rising ) the noise intensity . on the contrary , in homogeneous systems such as random networks , by increasing the noise intensity , the coalescence of un - synchronized clusters which are uniformly distributed over the network , results in a sudden fall in the global synchronization at the transition point .",
    "so the more complex is a system , more predictable it is .",
    "this work sheds more light on the different aspects of nonlinear dynamics on the top of homogeneous and heterogeneous network topologies and we hope that it promotes more researches on this very interesting problem .",
