    "shortly after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cbr ) , it was shown that cosmic ray protons above @xmath160 eev ( @xmath2ev ) should be attenuated by photomeson interactions with cbr photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was later calculated that heavier cosmic ray nuclei with similar _ total _ energies would also be attenuated , but by a different process , _ viz .",
    "_ , photodisintegration interactions with ibr photons ( @xcite ) , hereafter designated psb )",
    ". we will refer to such cosmic rays of total energies above 10 eev as ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhcr ) .",
    "in the more conventional scenario , uhcrs are charged particles which must be accelerated to ultrahigh energies by electromagnetic processes at extragalactic sites , both because there are no known sites in our galaxy which can accelerate and magnetically contain them and also because most of the observed uhcr air shower events arrive from directions outside of the galactic plane . although such acceleration of charged particles to energies above 100 eev in cosmic sources pushes our present theoretical ideas to their extreme , it has been suggested that it may occur in hot spots in the lobes of radio galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of the two highest energy air shower events yet observed , with energies of @xmath3 ( between 170 and 260 ) eev ( @xcite ) and @xmath4 eev ( @xcite ) has aggravated both the acceleration and propagation problems for cosmic - ray physicists .",
    "( very recently , the agasa group has presented a total of 6 events of energies between @xmath5 and @xmath3 eev , including the one cited above , observed since 1990 ( @xcite ) . )",
    "how does nature accelerate particles to these extreme energies and how do they get here from extragalactic sources ( @xcite ) ? to answer these questions , new physics has been invoked , physics involving the formation and annihilation of topological defects ( tds ) which may have been produced in the very earliest stages of the big bang , perhaps as a result of grand unification .",
    "a td annihilation or decay scenario has unique observational consequences , such as the copious production of uhcr neutrinos and @xmath0-rays ( @xcite and refs . therein ; @xcite ) . a new ground - based detector array experiment named after pierre auger ( @xcite ) and an interesting satellite experiment called _ owl _ ( @xcite )",
    "have been proposed to test look for such consequences .",
    "a uhcr _ proton _ of energy @xmath1 200 eev has a lifetime against photomeson losses of @xmath6s ; one of energy 300 eev has a lifetime of about half that stecker ( 1968 ) .",
    "these values correspond to linear propagation distances of @xmath1 30 and 15 mpc respectively .",
    "even shorter lifetimes were calculated for fe nuclei , based on photodisintegration off the ibr ( psb ) .",
    "recent estimates of the lifetimes of uhcr _",
    "@xmath0-rays _ against electron - positron pair production interactions with background radio photons give values below @xmath7s ( @xcite ) . within such distances , it is difficult to find candidate sources for uhcrs of such energies .    in this paper , we reexamine a part of the propagation problem by presenting the results of a new calculation of the photodisintegration of uhcr _ nuclei _ through the cbr and ibr in intergalactic space . in order to do this ,",
    "we have made use of a new determination of the ibr based on empirical data , primarily from iras galaxies , recently calculated by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) .",
    "they calculated the intensity and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ibr based on empirical data , some of which was obtained for almost 3000 iras galaxies .",
    "it is these sources which produce the ibr .",
    "the data used for the new ibr calculation included ( 1 ) the luminosity dependent seds of these galaxies , ( 2 ) the 60 @xmath8 m luminosity function for these galaxies , and ( 3 ) the redshift distribution of these galaxies .",
    "the magnitude of the ibr flux derived by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) is is considerably lower than that used in psb in their extensive examination of the photodisintegration of uhcr nuclei .    a search for absorption in the high energy @xmath0-ray spectra of extragalactic sources can also be used to help determine the value of the ibr or to place constraints on the magnitude of its flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed lack of strong absorption in the @xmath0-ray spectra of the active galaxies mrk 421 ( @xcite ) and mrk 501 ( @xcite ) up to an energy greater than @xmath1 5 - 10 tev is consistent with the new , lower value for the ibr used here ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sed calculated by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) agrees with direct estimates of the far infrared background obtained from the _ cobe / firas _ observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent fluxes reported from _",
    "cobe / dirbe _ obervations at 140 and 240 @xmath8 m ( @xcite ) are roughly a factor of 2 higher than the malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) predictions , but are consistent with them if one considers the systematic uncertainties in the observational results ( @xcite ) .",
    "in justifying our reexamination of the photodisintegration problem using the new ibr sed , we point out that it may reasonable to expect that the highest energy cosmic rays may be nuclei .",
    "this is because the maximum energy to which a particle can be accelerated in a source of a given size and magnetic field strength is proportional to its charge , @xmath9 .",
    "that charge is 26 times larger for fe than it is for protons .",
    "although some composition measurements in the energy range 0.1 - 10 eev appear to indicate a transition from heavier to lighter nuclei with increased energy ( @xcite ) , this and other data appear to be consistent with a `` mixed '' composition of both protons and heavier nuclei ( @xcite ) . in any case , at the `` lower '' energies for which composition measurements have been attempted , most of the cosmic rays may be galactic in origin .",
    "we have now done a full monte carlo calculation similar to that presented in psb , but using the new intergalactic infrared spectrum given by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) . in this new calculation",
    ", we have also specifically included the threshold energies of the various nuclear species to photodisintegration .",
    "the reason that this is now important is that with the cbr playing a relatively more important role , interactions of the steeply falling cosmic - ray spectrum near threshold with the wien tail of the cbr become important relative to the much flatter ibr photon spectrum .",
    "in fact , as we will show , taking account of the measured higher threshold energies ( as opposed to the artificial value of 2 mev taken by psb ) increases the value of the cutoff energy for heavy uhcr nuclei .",
    "our intent is to both update and improve the psb results and also to determine if the highest energy cr events seen by the fly s eye and akeno groups are consistent with their being heavy nuclei that have propagated to us from candidate active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energy loss from photodisintegration has a much stronger dependence on lorentz factor than on atomic weight , and increases strongly with lorentz factor @xmath0 ( psb ) .",
    "therefore , to maximize the propagation distance for a given total particle energy , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the nucleon mass ) , one takes the largest possible mass number .",
    "given the abundances of the elements , this nucleus is fe .",
    "therefore ( as psb have done ) we chose to examine the propagation history of nuclei originating as @xmath12fe , as this nuclide offers the best chance for providing a conventional explanation for the uhcr events .",
    "the nuclear photodisintegration process is dominated by the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , which peaks in the @xmath0-ray  energy range of 10 to 30 mev ( nuclear rest frame ) .",
    "experimental data are generally consistent with a two - step process : photoabsorption by the nucleus to form a compound state , followed by a statistical decay process involving the emission of one or more nucleons from the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photoabsorption cross section roughly obeys a thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule , _",
    "viz_. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass number , @xmath15 is the nuclear charge , @xmath16 , @xmath11 is the nucleon mass and @xmath17 is the photon energy in the rest system of the nucleus .",
    "the trk sum rule is not exact , however , owing to the presence of nuclear exchange forces ( @xcite ) , as can be seen in table 1 of psb ( which is based on the data tabulations of fuller , gerstenberg , vander molen , and dunn ( 1973 ) and related material supplied by e. fuller . )",
    "psb approximated the gdr cross section for a given nuclide ( @xmath18 ) with the parameterization @xmath19 where the @xmath15 and @xmath14 dependence of the width @xmath20 , the peak energy @xmath21 , and the dimensionless integrated cross sections @xmath22 and @xmath23 are understood , and are listed in table 1 of psb .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the heaviside step functions , and the normalization constants @xmath26 are given by @xmath27.\\ ] ] the index @xmath28 takes the values 1 or 2 , corresponding to single or double nucleon emission during the photodisintegration reaction . for energies @xmath29 mev ,",
    "the measured cross sections are dominated by single [ @xmath30 or @xmath31 or double [ @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 nucleon loss , since the threshold energies for the emission of larger numbers of nucleons are close to or exceed @xmath35 ( @xcite ) . from @xmath35 to @xmath36 mev , the cross section is approximated as flat , normalized so that the integrated cross section matches experimental values .",
    "the probability of emission of @xmath37 nucleons in this region is given by a distribution function which is independent of the @xmath0-ray  energy ( see table 2 of psb ) .",
    "above @xmath38 , detailed cross section data are more scarce ; we follow psb by approximating this smaller residual cross section by zero . interactions with photons of energy greater than @xmath39 will have a negligible contribution to the photodisintegration process for uhcr energies below 1000 eev owing to the fact that the density of the background photons seen by the uhcr near the peak of the gdr cross section falls rapidly with energy ( exponentially along the wien tail of the cbr , and roughly as @xmath40 in ir - optical region ) , along with the fact that the photodissociation cross section is about two orders of magnitude lower in the @xmath0-ray  energy region from @xmath38 to @xmath11 gev than at the gdr peak ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have verified by numerical tests that interactions with photons of energy greater than @xmath39 indeed have a negligible effect on our calculation .    in the psb calculation ,",
    "the gdr threshold energies were taken to be @xmath41 mev for _ all _ reaction channels .",
    "this value is far smaller than the true thresholds ; single - nucleon emission has a typical threshold of @xmath42 mev , while the double - nucleon emission energy threshold is typically @xmath43 mev .",
    "table 1 lists the energy thresholds for the @xmath30 , @xmath44 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 channels for each nuclide in the @xmath12fe decay chain ( taken from forkman & petersson , 1987 ) .",
    "owing to the increased importance of the cbr relative to the ibr that follows from the new , lower ibr estimates , and the presence of the wien tail that exponentially increases the target photon density at the gdr threshold ( see figure 1 ) , increasing this threshold energy may significantly lengthen the propagation distance of a highly relativistic nucleus .",
    "therefore we have used the measured threshold energies for a subset of the reaction channels that are given in table 1 .",
    "unfortunately , photodisintegration cross section data are incomplete . for many reaction channels",
    ", @xmath47 data do not exist .",
    "also , integrated cross section strengths are not available for all of the exclusive channels . the most complete compilation of the world s gdr cross section data exists in the 15 volumes of fuller & gerstenberg ( 1983 ) .",
    "in these volumes gdr cross section data for @xmath12fe , for example , are given only for the @xmath48 channel and the inverse channels @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "one can not perform the monte carlo calculations in such a way as to distinguish a @xmath30 interaction from a @xmath44 reaction when the relative branching ratios are not known . instead , we separately consider only single - nucleon emission ( as a single channel ) and double - nucleon emission ( as a single channel ) in the gdr region up to @xmath35 .",
    "we take the conservative approach of choosing the energy threshold for single - nucleon emission to be the _",
    "lowest _ of the two for @xmath30 and @xmath44 for each nuclide in the decay chain , with a similar choice for the two - nucleon emission channel .",
    "along most of the decay chain from @xmath12fe to @xmath51h there is only one stable isotope for a given mass @xmath14 . since the radioactive decay time to the line of stability is less than the one - nucleon photodisintegration loss time for all but three unstable nuclei , @xmath52mn , @xmath53al , and @xmath54be , we assume decay has brought the daughter nucleus to the line of stability before the next photon collision , so that for any given mass @xmath14 there is a unique charge @xmath15 .",
    "this clearly is not the case for mass values @xmath14 = 54 , 50 , 48 , 46 , 40 , and 36 , where more than one stable isotope exists , but the absence of cross section data for each of these isotopes makes this a moot point .",
    "we also note that although the thresholds are lowest for @xmath55 emission ( due to the @xmath55 s large binding energy ) , the integrated cross section for @xmath55 emission from @xmath12fe , for example , is over two orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath56 value for that nuclide ( skopic , asai , & murphy , 1980 ; see also fuller & gerstenberg , 1983 ) .",
    "we therefore neglect the @xmath55 emission channels entirely in our calculation .      for a uhcr nucleus with lorentz factor @xmath57 propagating through an isotropic soft photon background with differential number density @xmath58 , the photodisintegration rate @xmath59 ( lab frame ) is given by ( stecker 1969 ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the total cross section , summed over the number of emitted nucleons .    in our calculations",
    "we construct the soft photon background by summing three components : ( 1 ) the @xmath62k cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) from lab frame energies of @xmath63 ev to @xmath64 ev , ( 2 ) the infrared background radiation ( ibr ) estimated by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) from @xmath65 ev to 0.33 ev ( using the two `` best estimates '' shown by heavy lines in their figure 2 , which we denote as the `` high ibr '' and `` low ibr '' cases ) , and ( 3 ) the optical to uv diffuse , extragalactic photon background estimated by salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) ( taking their no - metallicity - correction case ) from @xmath66 ev to 13 ev .",
    "figure 1 shows the sed of the entire low energy background radiation .",
    "a salient feature of this figure is the roughly constant energy flux down to the dramatic rise of the wien tail of the cbr . for uhcr nuclei with lorentz factors large enough so that the cbr photons are above photodisintegration threshold , most of the reaction rate @xmath59 is dominated by collisions with cbr photons",
    "this is particularly true with the new , smaller ir photon background levels , compared to those used by psb .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the energy loss time @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the reaction rates for one- and two - nucleon emission , and @xmath71 is the reaction rate for @xmath72 nucleon loss .",
    "the reduction in @xmath0 comes from two effects : nuclear energy loss due to electron - positron pair production off the cbr background , and the @xmath0-ray  momentum absorbed by the nucleus during the formation of the excited compound nuclear state that preceeds nucleon emission .",
    "this latter effect is much smaller ( of order @xmath73 ) than the energy loss from nucleon emission and will therefore be neglected . for the former mechanism ,",
    "we use the results given in figure 3 of blumenthal ( 1970 ) , which gives the loss rate for relativistic nuclei off the cbr calculated in the first born approximation .",
    "( we note that the coulomb corrections to the born approximation ( @xcite ) have a negligible effect on the pair production loss rate for ultrarelativistic fe nuclei . )",
    "figure 2 shows the energy loss rates due to single - nucleon , double - nucleon , and pair production processes for @xmath12fe as a function of energy , along with the total energy loss rate .",
    "also shown is the total energy loss rate when the photodisintegration thresholds @xmath74 are all set to 2 mev ; this indicates the effect of incorporating more realistic threshold energies in the monte carlo calculation , compared to those of psb .",
    "[ fig2 ]      figure 3 shows the spectra of uhcr nuclei which started out as @xmath12fe after propagating linear distances from 1 to 1000 mpc ( corresponding to lifetimes between @xmath75 and @xmath76 s ) , assuming a source differential energy spectrum @xmath77 over the energy interval 10 to 1000 eev .",
    "the effect of the cbr `` wall '' at the wien side of the 2.73k blackbody spectrum is to produce a sharp cutoff at a rather well defined energy , @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig3 ]    figure 4 shows the cutoff energy as a function of propagation time , where @xmath79 is defined as the cr energy at which the propagated differential flux is @xmath80 that of the unpropagated flux .",
    "for comparison , the cutoff energies calculated by psb are also shown .",
    "it can be seen that ( except for energies above @xmath3 eev ) for a given energy , the propagation time increases by a substantial factor over that calculated by psb , who assumed larger ibr fluxes and a 2 mev threshold for all photodisintegration interactions .",
    "we also note that our new results do not differ significantly for the two seds adopted from malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) and , except for the longest propagation times , they do not differ significantly from the no - ibr case shown in the figure .",
    "this is because the new values obtained for the ibr are so low .",
    "as can be seen from figure 4 , our use of the new , lower values for the intergalactic infrared photon flux , together with the explicit inclusion of the measured threshold energies for photodisintegration of the individual nuclides involved in the calculation , has the effect of increasing the cutoff energy ( for a given propagation time ) of heavy uhcr nuclei over that originally calculated by psb .",
    "this increase may have significant consequences for understanding the origin of the highest energy cosmic ray air shower events .",
    "stanev ( 1995 ) and biermann ( 1998 ) have examined the arrival directions of the highest energy events .",
    "they point out that the @xmath1200 eev event is within 10@xmath81 of the direction of the strong radio galaxy ngc315 .",
    "ngc315 lies at a distance of only @xmath1 60 mpc from us . for that distance ,",
    "our results indicate that heavy nuclei would have a cutoff energy of @xmath1 130 eev , which may be within the uncertainty in the energy determination for this event .",
    "the @xmath1300 eev event is within 12@xmath81 of the strong radio galaxy 3c134 .",
    "the distance to 3c134 is unknown because its location behind a dense molecular cloud in our galaxy obscures the spectral lines required for a redshift measurement . it may therefore be possible that _ either _ cosmic ray protons ( stecker 1968 ) _ or _ heavy nuclei originated in these sources and produced these highest energy air shower events .",
