    "quantum biology is swiftly emerging as an interdisciplinary science synthesizing , in novel and unexpected ways , the richness and complexity of biological systems with quantum physics and quantum information science .",
    "the intuitive disposition prevailing until recently , namely that quantum coherence phenomena have no relevance to biology , can be simply understood .",
    "indeed , quantum coherence has been clearly manifested in carefully prepared and well - isolated quantum systems , the experimental implementation of which was technically demanding .",
    "it was thus plausible to assume that all timescales of interest in complex biological matter are orders of magnitude larger than the coherence time of any underlying quantum phenomenon .",
    "in other words , decoherence has been assumed to be detrimental merely due to the complexity of biological systems and the vast environments they offer as sinks of quantum information , environments that were understood to be anything but `` carefully prepared '' .    in recent years , however , a different physical picture is gradually emerging .",
    "biological systems are indeed nothing like single atoms trapped in ultra - high vacuum , allowing the observation of coherences lasting for several seconds @xcite or even hours for solid - state nuclear spin systems @xcite .",
    "but they are also nothing like a classical system where decoherence has obliterated any chance to detect off - diagonal elements of the relevant density matrix @xcite .",
    "it appears that nature has optimized biological function using both worlds , i.e. taking advantage of quantum coherence amidst an equally essential yet not detrimental decoherence .    in this review",
    "we focus on a major driving force of quantum biology , namely the quantum dynamics of the radical - pair mechanism ( rpm ) .",
    "the rpm involves a multi - spin system of electrons and nuclei embedded in a biomolecule and undergoing a number of physical / chemical processes , like magnetic interactions and coherent spin motion , electron transfer and spin relaxation to name just a few . for an overview of rpm s long scientific history",
    "we refer the reader to a number of reviews of the earlier work on radical - ion pairs and spin chemistry @xcite .",
    "although the rpm has been known since the 1960s , the rich quantum physical underpinnings of the mechanism have been unraveled only recently . the first paper @xcite discussing rpm in the context of modern quantum information theory introduced quantum measurements as a necessary concept to understand the quantum dynamics of rpm , leading among other things to the fundamental spin decoherence process of radical - ion - pair ( rp ) reactions . in a number of papers that followed @xcite ,",
    "the intricate quantum effects at play in rp reactions were further elucidated .",
    "quantum measurement dynamics , phononics , in particular the phonon vacuum , quantum coherence and decoherence , in particular measurement - induced decoherence , coherence distillation , quantum coherence quantifiers , quantum correlations , quantum jumps and the quantum zeno effect , concepts from quantum metrology and the quantum - communications concept of quantum retrodiction were shown to be central for understanding rpm .    were it not for these conceptual underpinnings",
    ", it would be hard to justify why rpm constitutes a paradigm for quantum biology .",
    "it can of course be argued that radical - ion pairs involve spins , and spins are genuine quantum objects , but this argument points to the atomistic , structural aspect of biology .",
    "that is , one could also argue that spins , e.g. singlet states in the helium atom , determine atomic structure and atomic structure is the basis of biological structure , alas this is not what quantum biology is about .",
    "we hope , however , to convince the reader that rpm s position on the map of quantum biology is indeed well - deserved .    this review will focus on our recent work concerning the quantum foundations of rpm .",
    "this biochemical spin system is an open system and hence the relevant density matrix @xmath0 does not just obey schrdinger s equation , @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the system s hamiltonian , but more terms are required to account for the `` open '' character of rps .",
    "these terms are compactly written as a `` reaction super - operator '' @xmath3 .",
    "the master equation @xmath1+{\\cal l}(\\rho)$ ] is the starting point for all theoretical calculations involving rp reactions , hence the foundational character of this discussion .",
    "our specific quest has been to find the exact form of the reaction super - operator @xmath3 .",
    "until we entered this field in 2008 , the overwhelming majority of theoretical treatments in spin chemistry have used what we now understand is a phenomenological theory elaborated upon by haberkorn @xcite in 1976 .",
    "returning to the chronological exposition , the first paper @xcite illuminating the quantum - information substratum of rpm led to a resurgent interest of the spin chemistry community on the foundational aspects of the field @xcite , and in parallel to a flurry of activity in the quantum science community@xcite , even prompting some authors to announce , more or less timely , `` the dawn of quantum biology '' @xcite .",
    "the main motivation and excitement behind this work has largely been rpm s relation to the avian magnetic compass .",
    "it is clear that concepts of quantum measurements , quantum ( de)coherence and entanglement take on a distinct scientific flavor when applied to migrating birds . in this review",
    "we will only cover the part of the literature relevant to our specific quest of obtaining the master equation for @xmath4 .",
    "we feel that the rest of the literature , especially papers discussing quantum coherence and entanglement in chemical magnetoreception , address a very promising research venue , however they are mostly based on the traditional description of rp dynamics . since the qualitative and quantitative understanding of quantum coherence and entanglement is intimately tied to the master equation for @xmath4 , these discussions could be premature .    focusing on the rpm ,",
    "we will not cover other , equally exciting venues of quantum biology , like quantum effects in photosynthetic light harvesting and olfaction recently reviewed @xcite , coupling quantum light to retinal rod cells @xcite , testing for electron spin effects in anesthesia @xcite , and studying ion transport in neuronal ion channels @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the outline of this review is the following . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the basic notions of spin chemistry , touching upon the traditional approach to the radical - pair mechanism . in section 3",
    "we present our work on the quantum foundations of rpm . in light of this discussion",
    ", we revisit the traditional approach in section 4 and explore its weaknesses and limits of validity . in section 5 we study single - molecule quantum trajectories , which allow us to obtain a deeper understanding of both approaches and test their internal consistency . in section 6 we discuss other competing theoretical approaches .",
    "we devote section 7 to discussing the nonlinear nature of our master equation , and its relation to foundational concepts of quantum physics .",
    "we close with an outlook in section 8 .",
    "spin chemistry @xcite deals with the effect of electron and nuclear spins on chemical reactions . that such an effect is possible in the first place is not too straightforward to understand .",
    "indeed , covalent and hydrogen bond energies are on the order of 1000 kj / mole and 10 kj / mole , respectively , while the electron s zeeman energy in a laboratory magnetic field of 1 kg is on the order of 1 j / mole , let alone earth s field .",
    "yet even at earth s field , electron and nuclear spins can have quite a tangible effect in this class of chemical reactions .",
    "the explanation , to be revisited later , is an intricate combination of spin precession and electron transfer timescales with spin angular momentum conservation .",
    "although the first organic free radical , triphenylmethyl , was discovered by gomberg in 1900 , the origin of spin chemistry is set in the 1960s , when anomalously high epr @xcite and soon later nmr @xcite signals were observed in chemical reactions of organic molecules , termed cidep ( chemically induced dynamic electron polarization ) and cidnp ( chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization ) , respectively .",
    "the radical - pair mechanism was introduced by closs and closs @xcite and by kaptein and oosterhoff @xcite as a reaction intermediate explaining these observations ( a recent editorial @xcite briefly reviews the field s history and early literature ) . since then",
    ", spin chemistry has grown into a mature field of experimental and theoretical physical chemistry @xcite . in particular",
    ", the effects related to cidnp @xcite , which we will address in section 5.2 , continue to attract a lot of interest since cidnp has become a versatile tool to study photosynthetic reaction centers @xcite .    an intriguing result of early spin - chemistry work was the proposal by schulten @xcite that avian magnetoreception is based on rp reactions . in this review",
    "we will not touch upon applying spin chemistry to magnetoreception , referring the reader to a representative part @xcite of an extensive literature .",
    "the quantum degrees of freedom of radical - ion pairs are formed by a multi - spin system embedded in a biomolecule , which can be either in the liquid or in the solid phase . in particular ,",
    "rps are biomolecular ions created by a charge transfer from a photo - excited d@xmath5a donor - acceptor dyad da , schematically described by the reaction @xmath6 , where the two dots represent the two unpaired electron spins of the two radicals .",
    "the excited state d@xmath5a is usually a spin zero state , hence the initial spin state of the two unpaired electrons of the radical - pair is also singlet , denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "now , both d and a contain a number of magnetic nuclei which hyperfine - couple to the respective electron .",
    "neither singlet - state nor triplet state rps are eigenstates of the resulting hamiltonian , @xmath2 , hence the initial formation of @xmath7 is followed by singlet - triplet ( s - t ) mixing , i.e. a coherent oscillation of the spin state of the electrons , designated by @xmath8 .",
    "concomitantly , nuclear spins also precess , and hence the total electron / nuclear spin system undergoes a coherent spin motion driven by hyperfine couplings and the rest of the magnetic interactions to be detailed later .",
    "this coherent spin motion has , however , a finite lifetime .",
    "charge recombination , i.e. charge transfer from a back to d , terminates the reaction and leads to the formation of the neutral reaction products .",
    "it is angular momentum conservation at this step that empowers the molecule s spin degrees of freedom and their minuscule energy to determine the reaction s fate : there are two kinds of neutral products , singlet ( the original da molecules ) and triplet , @xmath9da .",
    "as it turns out , their relative proportion can be substantially affected by spin interactions entering the mixing hamiltonian @xmath2 . for completeness",
    "we note that the reaction can close through the so - called intersystem crossing @xmath10 , mediated by e.g. spin - orbit coupling . a schematic diagram of the above is shown in fig . [ schematic]a .",
    "a and a subsequent charge transfer produces a singlet state radical - pair @xmath7 , which is coherently converted to the triplet radical - pair , @xmath11 , due to intramolecule magnetic interactions .",
    "simultaneously , spin - selective charge recombination leads to singlet ( da ) and triplet neutral products ( @xmath9da ) .",
    "the latter can intersystem cross into da and close the reaction cycle .",
    "( b ) simplified version of ( a ) neglecting the photoexcitation and charge transfer steps",
    ". both diagrams could be misleading if taken too literally , since they might suggest that e.g. only singlet radical - pairs recombine to singlet neutral products .",
    "this is not the case , since a radical - pair in a coherent s - t superposition can recombine into e.g. a singlet neutral product ( see section 3.7).,width=7 ]    omitting the light excitation and initial charge transfer , which commence the reaction in a timescale usually faster than the reaction dynamics , the reaction scheme can be simplified into fig .",
    "[ schematic]b . as shown with the two shaded boxes in fig .",
    "[ schematic]b , the rp reaction consists of two physically very different processes working simultaneously : ( a ) the unitary dynamics embodied by the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath2 driving a coherent s - t oscillation of the rp spin state , and ( b ) the non - unitary reaction dynamics reducing the rp population in a spin - dependent way . as it will turn out , the latter are the hardest to understand .",
    "the density matrix @xmath0 describes the spin state of the rp s two electrons and @xmath12 magnetic nuclei located in d and a. its dimension is @xmath13 , where 4 is the spin multiplicity of the two unpaired electrons , @xmath14 is the spin multiplicity of the @xmath12 nuclear spins , and @xmath15 is the nuclear spin of the @xmath16-th nucleus , with @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest possible rp contains just one spin-1/2 nucleus hyperfine coupled to e.g. the donor s unpaired electron . in this case",
    "the density matrix has dimension @xmath18 .",
    "although unrealistic , this simple system exhibits much of the essential physics without the additional computational burden of more nuclear spins and matrices of higher dimension , therefore it is frequently used as a model system .",
    "it is angular momentum conservation at the recombination process that forces the decomposition of the rp s spin space into an electron singlet and an electron triplet subspace , defined by the respective projectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these are @xmath21 matrices given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the spin operators of the donor and acceptor electrons written as @xmath26-dimensional operators , e.g. the @xmath16-th component of @xmath24 would be written as @xmath27 , where the first operator in the kronecker product refers to the donor s electron spin , the second to the acceptor s electron spin and the rest to the nuclear spins . by @xmath28",
    "we denote the regular ( 2 dimensional ) spin-1/2 operators and by @xmath29 the @xmath30-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "the projectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are complete and orthogonal , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the rp s singlet subspace has dimension @xmath14 while the triplet subspace has dimension @xmath33 .",
    "the electron - spin multiplicity 1 in the former corresponds to the singlet state = 1(- ) , while the electron - spin multiplicity of 3 in the latter stems from the triplet states @xmath34 the coupled basis @xmath35 describes the two unpaired electron spins .",
    "for example , for an rp containing @xmath36 spin-1/2 nuclei , it would be @xmath37 and the projectors would be written as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "there are also two rates to consider , the singlet and triplet recombination rates , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "these are defined as follows : at @xmath42 we prepare an rp ensemble having no magnetic interactions ( @xmath43 ) in the singlet ( triplet ) electron state ( and any nuclear spin state ) .",
    "then its population would decay exponentially at the rate @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "in general , during a time interval @xmath44 , the measured singlet and triplet neutral products will be @xmath45 indeed , if all rps were in the singlet or triplet state , the fraction of them recombining in the singlet or triplet channel during @xmath44 would be @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . if they are in the general state described by @xmath0 , then @xmath46 and @xmath47 have to be multiplied by the respective fraction of singlet and triplet rps .",
    "radical - ion pairs are usually produced from an electron spin zero neutral precursor , so their initial state is the electron singlet state .",
    "the thermal proton polarization at room temperature and at magnetic fields as large as 10 kg is about @xmath48 , which for all practical purposes can be approximated by zero .",
    "the rp initial state having zero nuclear polarization and being in the singlet electron spin state is _",
    "0=q_s[singlet ] indeed , since @xmath49 , it is @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 is the @xmath16-th component ( @xmath52 ) of the @xmath53-th nuclear spin , then @xmath54 since @xmath51 are traceless operators .    .",
    "the different nuclear spin environment of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the basis of singlet - triplet mixing.,width=7 ]      the magnetic interactions included in @xmath2 drive the unitary rp dynamics .",
    "the simplest way to understand s - t mixing is by using the classical vector model and considering first an imaginary rp consisting of just two electron spins having larmor frequencies different by @xmath57 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ st2e]a , if the initial state is the singlet state @xmath58 , after a time @xmath59 the two spins will have developed a @xmath60 phase difference , their state becoming the triplet @xmath61 . in reality",
    "this model is encountered in the so - called @xmath62 mechanism operating at high magnetic fields @xcite , where an actual difference in the g - factor of the two electrons is responsible for their different larmor frequency . in most cases , however , s - t mixing is caused by the different nuclear spin environment coupled to each electron through hyperfine interactions .",
    "to illustrate hyperfine - induced s - t mixing , we consider the example of py - dma ( pyrene - dimethylaniline ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ st2e]b . here",
    "py is the electron donor and dma the acceptor , i.e. the rp is @xmath63 . in this example , the donor radical has 10 proton spins hyperfine coupled to its unpaired electron , while the acceptor radical has 12 spins , 11 protons and one nitrogen , coupled to its unpaired electron .",
    "this difference in nuclear spin environments `` seen '' by the unpaired electrons of @xmath55 and @xmath56 drives s - t mixing .    to come back to the earlier discussion of the very possibility of spin - dependent chemical reactions , note that the diffusion constant of py / dma in typical solvents used in @xcite is @xmath64 , while the inter - radical distance where the rp recombination reaction is appreciable is @xcite on the order of 10 nm , hence the reaction dynamics take place at a timescale of about 100 ns . the electron spin precession time at a hyperfine magnetic field of 10 g is about 30 ns , short enough for spin motion to influence the reaction yields .",

    "@xmath0 is 4-dimensional .",
    "singlet - triplet mixing occurs at the mixing frequency @xmath75 . in fig .",
    "[ examples]b we consider an rp with just one spin-1/2 nucleus coupled to e.g. the donor electron , so the hamiltonian reads @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the isotropic hyperfine coupling and @xmath78 the nuclear spin operator . in this case",
    "@xmath18 . moving to higher - dimensional examples , in fig .",
    "[ examples]c we consider two spin-1/2 nuclei , one coupled to the donor and one to the acceptor electron . now",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . finally , in fig .",
    "[ examples]d we consider a 64-dimensional case where 4 nuclear spins couple to the donor electron , hence @xmath81 . unlike the previous cases , the evolution is seen to be aperiodic @xcite , due to a superposition of multiple s - t oscillations .",
    "although not of concern for this review , we note that other sorts of interactions can be included in @xmath2 , like spin - exchange and long - range dipolar @xcite .",
    "moreover , hyperfine couplings can also be anisotropic @xcite .",
    "besides the unitary evolution of the rp spin density matrix @xmath0 , the reaction super - operator describing the spin - dependent population loss into neutral products must also be taken into account .",
    "the majority of theoretical calculations were so far performed with haberkorn s master equation , also termed `` traditional '' in recent years when other approaches came along : = -i[h,]-_haberkorn s  reaction  super - operator[trad ] obviously , the master equation for @xmath0 is fundamental for spin chemistry , being the basis for predicting all experimental observables .",

    "( c ) the magnetic field effect @xcite is about the magnetic field dependence of the time evolution of @xmath91 , and is defined as @xmath92 .    to summarize , the particular form of the reaction super - operator of or any contending master equation is imprinted in all physically accessible observables .",
    "importantly , the reaction super - operator does not only reduce the rp population , @xmath91 , but also induces a change in the spin - state character embodied by @xmath0 when @xmath93 . to understand this , consider a balanced mixture of singlet and triplet rps which are magnetically frozen , i.e. there are no magnetic interactions , @xmath43 ( such idealized scenarios will be used frequently in order to gain physical intuition on the dynamics ) .",
    "if @xmath94 , the balance is not distorted as the rps disappear at the same rate irrespective of their total electron spin . on the other hand , if @xmath93 , the ensemble of surviving rps will become more singlet ( triplet ) if @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . as an example , we plot in fig .",

    "a , we use the traditional master equation and plot the time evolution of ( a ) @xmath98 and ( b ) the rp population @xmath91 , for three different cases : ( i ) @xmath94 , ( ii ) @xmath99 and ( iii ) @xmath100.,width=7 ]",
    "we will now lay out the main premise of this review , demonstrating that the rpm is a biochemical system surprisingly rich in quantum - information - science concepts and effects .",
    "the need for such concepts appears when one recognizes the physical model behind the rpm and attempts to translate this model into a master equation .",

    "[ rip_levels ] was understood before our work , the physical picture following from taking this model at face value was not .",
    "we have shown that radical - pairs are both _",
    "leaky _ and _ open _ quantum systems , hence their non - unitary dynamics consist of two processes unfolding simultaneously and independently : ( a ) singlet - triplet decoherence and ( b ) spin - dependent population decay .",
    "both processes are intimately linked to the vibrational reservoirs .",
    "the phonon degrees of freedom in rp reactions are reminiscent of another emerging field , quantum phononics .",
    "coherent manipulation of phonons @xcite is witnessing a rapid growth in recent years both due to the fundamental interest of reaching the quantum limit in mechanical degrees of freedom @xcite and due to the potential of developing novel phonon - based technologies @xcite . regarding biological systems ,",
    "it would at first sight appear that vibrations just represent a classical noise source adding to the complexity of the molecular scaffold supporting biological dynamics .",
    "again , the counterintuitive picture is currently emerging that nature is also able to harness quantum degrees of freedom of vibrations in intricate ways . in photosynthesis , phonons are understood to crucially regulate energy transport in light - harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "what we will demonstrate next is that the _ phonon vacuum _ is the fundamental source of s - t decoherence in rp reactions , much like the photon vacuum is for atomic coherences .",
    "null quantum measurements are well - known in quantum optics .",
    "a vivid example @xcite is the single atom surrounded by an array of unit - quantum - efficiency photodetectors",
    ". if the atom is initially in a coherent superposition of the ground and excited states , @xmath103 , and if no photon is detected until time @xmath104 , the atomic state will be ( apart from a normalization constant ) @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the spontaneous decay rate .",
    "the interpretation is that even the absence of a photon detection can condition our knowledge of the atom s state , e.g. if no photon is ever detected then the atom s state can not contain an excited state component .    in analogy ,",
    "consider a single radical - ion pair in the spin state @xmath107 at @xmath42 .",
    "suppose that within the following time interval @xmath44 there is no detection of a neutral recombination product .",
    "what is @xmath108 ? in our first publication",
    "@xcite we provided a first - principles derivation of the master equation for non - recombining ( or surviving ) rps , that is , the case of no detection of recombination products .",
    "we have shown that until an rp charge - recombines , it does not just undergo hamiltonian evolution , as was intuitively expected , but it suffers random projections to the singlet or triplet electron spin state . in the ensemble picture , this represents a _",
    "fundamental _ s - t decoherence process in the sense that it can not in any way be mitigated .",
    "in contrast , _ technical _ decoherence can in principle be suppressed in an experiment designed carefully enough . to give an exaggerated example , inadvertently radiating rps with radio - frequency noise ( as it is purposefully done in studying bird disorientation @xcite ) ,",
    "would cause spin decoherence .",
    "this can obviously be suppressed by removing rf noise sources from the experiment s proximity , hence rf noise is an example of technical decoherence . the physical process we will present next is not such a technical source of decoherence , but an unavoidable one , intimately linked to the radical - pair recombination mechanism .",
    "when dealing with open quantum systems it is crucial to correctly identify the open system and its environment , so that one can apply the standard treatment of evolving the combined system and tracing out the environment .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ rip_levels ] , we have identified as the `` system '' the spin degrees of freedom of the radical - ion pair , described by the rp density matrix @xmath0 .",

    "we stress that these vibrational states are empty , or unoccupied , as long as the rp has not recombined .",
    "they should not be confused with the thermally excited vibrational states of the radical - pair itself .",
    "when the back electron - transfer from the acceptor a to the donor d neutralizes the radical - pair , the neutral molecule finds itself in an excited vibrational state .",

    "we call this measure @xmath204 and we treat it as a probability measure taking values between 0 ( zero s - t coherence ) and 1 ( maximum s - t coherence ) .    however , there are a few complications .",
    "first , @xmath0 carries information about all sorts of coherences , e.g. nuclear spin coherences .",
    "but we are interested in quantifying the coherence between the electron singlet and triplet subspace , irrespective of the nuclear spin state . for example , consider the two - nuclear - spin radical - pair in the state @xmath205 .",
    "this state contains nuclear spin coherence and , in fact , also nuclear spin entanglement , however it is an eigenstate of @xmath19 , and hence has zero s - t coherence .",
    "we need a measure quantifying three types of singlet - triplet coherence that can in general exist , s - t@xmath206 , s - t@xmath207 and s - t@xmath208 . in @xcite",
    "we defined c()=_j=0,[crho ] , where @xmath209 is the projector , which really are @xmath21 matrices operating in the @xmath26-dimensional space of the radical - pair under consideration . ] to one of the three triplet subspaces .",
    "this definition is motivated by considering the most general pure state of a radical - pair , written as @xmath210 , where @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 are complex amplitudes , and @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are arbitrary and normalized spin states of multiple nuclei .",
    "it is @xmath219 , hence indeed @xmath220 describes the combined `` strength '' of all three coherences . for the example states given in and it would be @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively .    a second complication has to do with the normalization of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath220 is linear in the matrix elements of @xmath0 , scaling as @xmath91 , which is a decaying function of time due to charge recombination , @xmath220 is also a decaying function of time .",
    "therefore @xmath220 has to be normalized by @xmath91 in order to define the following probability measure .    to extract such a measure from @xmath220",
    ", we must normalize @xmath220 by its maximum .",
    "in @xcite we calculated the maximum of @xmath220 when only the hamiltonian evolution is taken into account , i.e. @xmath223 , where @xmath224 $ ] .",
    "so in @xcite we defined p_coh=1\\{}c()[pcoh1 ] in retrospect , this definition of the normalization is not satisfactory , because if one is given a density matrix @xmath0 describing an rp ensemble without any reference to @xmath2 , the measure @xmath204 can not be calculated .",
    "surely , in most calculations where one propagates the density matrix , the evolution is driven by a known hamiltonian .",
    "but in principle it would be desirable to have a measure @xmath204 defined by just providing the density matrix @xmath0 . another way to normalize @xmath220 based solely on @xmath0",
    "is derived from the most general pure state @xmath225 given before .",
    "we define the maximally s - t coherent pure state as the state having equal amplitudes in all four terms of @xmath136 , @xmath226 .",
    "due to normalization it follows that @xmath227 and hence @xmath228 .",
    "we can thus define p_coh=43c()[pcoh2 ] a few comments are in order : ( i ) the definition of @xmath220 has the proper ( linear ) scaling with the density matrix elements to qualify @xcite for a proper measure of coherence .",
    "( ii ) we defined the pure state of maximum coherence as in @xcite , where it is stated that in a space of dimension @xmath229 spanned by the vectors @xmath230 , where @xmath231 , the state of maximum coherence is @xmath232 .",
    "( iii ) in idealized theoretical scenarios , e.g. when one considers a 2-dimensional radical - pair spanned by just two states , @xmath58 and @xmath61 , the normalization constant 3/4 changes accordingly , i.e. it would become 1/2 .",
    "( iv ) when we first introduced the need for an s - t coherence measure @xcite we defined @xmath204 in a way that it scales quadratically with the matrix elements of @xmath193 , and this is not an acceptable measure according to @xcite .",
    "the definition alleviates this problem .",
    "( v ) the different normalizations in and produce acceptable numerical differences , but a more thorough study is required to fully understand the normalization of @xmath220 .",
    "there is one more step before proceeding with the theory of quantum retrodiction .",
    "as mentioned previously , the general rp density matrix can be written as @xmath233 .",
    "having defined the coherence measure @xmath234 , we can introduce two new matrices , the maximally incoherent and maximally coherent version of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath235 and @xmath236 , respectively , and given by @xmath237 while the interpretation @xmath235 is obvious , the interpretation of @xmath236 is more subtle .",
    "reminiscent of the concept of entanglement distillation @xcite , @xmath236 alludes to the coherence - distilled version of @xmath0 , since @xmath238 . to give a simple example , consider like in section 3.7.1 a mixture of @xmath36 radical - pairs in the state @xmath184 and @xmath30 radical - pairs in the singlet state @xmath185 .",
    "it is @xmath239 , so @xmath204 should be the probability that picking an rp out of the ensemble it will have maximum s - t coherence . in general , using and",
    "we can write any density matrix @xmath0 as @xmath240 .      in fig .",
    "[ qc ] we show that rp reactions can be viewed as a biochemical realization of quantum communication .",
    "indeed , the rp spin state might be considered as the quantum state held by alice , the sender .",
    "bob just detects singlet or triplet neutral products . from these",
    "he might infer the information stored in alice s states , for example the value of the applied magnetic field .",
    "quantum retrodiction probabilistically answers the question of what was the pre - recombination state of a radical - pair , the neutral product of which is detected by bob .",
    "the relevant formalism @xcite is used in @xcite to calculate the conditional probabilities that upon detecting a singlet ( triplet ) product , the pre - recombination state of the radical - pair was maximally coherent or maximally incoherent , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 .",
    "to arrive at the reaction terms , we need to subtract the estimated pre - recombination state of the recombined radical - pair from the density matrix of the surviving rps .",
    "this crucially depends on s - t coherence @xcite . for a maximally coherent density matrix",
    "it is @xmath243 whereas for a maximally incoherent density matrix it is @xmath244 stated in words , these rules mean that in the extreme of maximum coherence we have to subtract the full pre - recombination state from @xmath0 , whereas in the opposite extreme we subtract either a singlet or a triplet rp .",
    "the previous update rules hold for a single molecule . during @xmath44",

    "as expected , the normalization of @xmath0 decreases by the neutral products appearing in the time interval @xmath44 , i.e. from we find @xmath249 .",
    "given the particular hamiltonian @xmath2 and recombination rates @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and using the definition of @xmath204 , it is straightforward to propagate @xmath0 starting from a specific initial condition .",
    "consider an imaginary rp having a non - reactive triplet state and no s - t mixing , i.e. take @xmath250 and @xmath43 .",
    "\\(i ) singlet initial state , @xmath251 .",
    "we expect the rp population to decay exponentially at a rate @xmath40 , the surviving rp state remaining the same as at @xmath42 . indeed , it is @xmath252 and @xmath253 . plugging these and @xmath43 ,",

    "\\(iii ) maximally coherent superposition @xmath261 .",
    "now the master equation can not be solved analytically , since at @xmath42 we have a maximally coherent state with @xmath262 , but right in the following interval @xmath44 the s - t dephasing super - operator @xmath173 will produce a partially coherent state having @xmath263 , hence all terms of @xmath246 will start contributing .",
    "however , as a preamble to quantum trajectories to be discussed in section 5 , we note four possibilities for state evolution during the interval @xmath44 : ( 1 ) singlet projection , with probability @xmath264 , ( 2 ) triplet projection with probability @xmath265 , ( 3 ) singlet recombination with probability @xmath266 , and ( 4 ) no evolution , i.e. the state remains @xmath107 , with probability @xmath267 .",
    "those rps projected at some point to the non - reactive triplet state will remain there .",
    "their total number as @xmath268 is @xmath269 .    at first sight",
    "this is a weird result challenging our understanding of quantum measurements .",
    "starting with @xmath270 , in which the probability for the rp to be in the triplet state is 1/2 , we find that only 25% of the rps are locked in the non - reactive triplet state at the end of this reaction .",
    "the apparent contradiction with our intuition is due a cavalier phrasing in the previous argument . indeed ,",
    "if we prepare an rp ensemble in the state @xmath107 and _ immediately perform a global projective measurement on the ensemble _ , we will find 50% of the rps in @xmath271 and 50% in @xmath272 .",
    "but the radical - pair reaction is not a global projective measurement performed at once on all rps .",
    "instead , it proceeds as a continuous intra - molecule measurement leading to the already discussed random projections .",
    "these enhance the singlet yield , since those rps projected to the singlet state will definitely recombine at some point .",
    "the case @xmath87 is especially simple , since the reaction is spin - independent , so @xmath246 should not have any effect on the rp state . indeed , now it is @xmath273 , hence @xmath1-k(\\rho{{\\rm",

    "if we now consider the case @xmath43 and write @xmath276 we easily find @xmath277 , meaning that the initially present coherence @xmath278 decays at the rate @xmath279 , while the population decays a the rate @xmath88 .",
    "that is , coherence is damped due to the decaying population , but also due to the intrinsic s - t dephasing process .",
    "if the master equation we arrived at is a deeper theory capturing the quantum dynamics of rp reactions , then haberkorn s master equation must be some sort of limiting case of our theory .",
    "it is readily seen that haberkorn s master equation can be recast in the form @xmath1+{\\cal d}\\llbracket\\rho\\rrbracket+{\\cal r}_{h}\\llbracket\\rho\\rrbracket$ ] , where @xmath280 is haberkorn s reaction operator : _",
    "h =- k_sq_sq_s - k_tq_tq_t[rh ] if by hand we force @xmath253 in our reaction operator @xmath246 , we exactly retrieve @xmath280 . in other words ,",
    "the s - t dephasing process @xmath173 is latently built into haberkorn s master equation , however the reaction terms skew the state evolution of rps by retrodicting the pre - recombination state always assuming zero s - t coherence .    in his 1976 paper haberkorn had qualitatively examined various forms of the master equation , one being the decoherence master equation .",
    "however , he correctly dismissed it since it is trace - preserving and hence `` corresponds to spin relaxation without reaction '' .",
    "we now understand that s - t dephasing is just one aspect of the dynamics running simultaneously with the other , the rp recombination . in any case ,",
    "haberkorn s 1976 paper is a tribute to the power of simple physical arguments leading to important insights .",
    "the traditional master equation has been used in most theoretical considerations in the field of spin chemistry since the late 1960s , adequately accounting for many experiments .",
    "so a natural question to ask is : why do we need a new theory when the one at hand , even if not fundamentally sound , appears to be good enough ? towards the answer we first remind the reader of the early era of atomic physics , when atom - light interactions were successfully described by einstein s rate equations , which just considered the transfer of atomic populations between atomic states , the transfer being triggered by ( at the time incoherent ) light sources such as lamps .",
    "after the invention of the laser , the field of coherent atomic interactions exploded , since atomic coherences could then be excited and probed .",
    "einstein s rate equations were not sufficient to describe experiments , which required the introduction of the atomic density matrix , i.e. the coupled time evolution of atomic populations and coherences .",
    "the parameter deciding which approach is the most suitable is the ratio of the rabi frequency of the exciting light to the relaxation rate , which in this case is the spontaneous decay rate .    in spin chemistry ,",
    "many experiments so far have been apparently dominated by spin relaxation , which among other things , also damps s - t coherence quantified by @xmath204 .",
    "if these relaxation phenomena push @xmath204 towards zero much faster than the fundamental decoherence mechanism we have considered , then our master equation quickly converges to the traditional theory .",
    "this will be further quantified in the following subsection .",
    "we can thus arrive at the conclusion that , notwithstanding fortuitous agreement with experiments brought about by relaxing environments , understanding spin chemistry experiments at the fundamental level is not possible within the traditional theory .",
    "moreover , without a fundamental theory it is neither possible to predict the full range of physical effects that can be _ in principle _ observed , nor design new experiments and explore new fronts of the field .",
    "for example , understanding the avian compass mechanism at the quantum level , e.g. addressing the fundamental heading error of the compass and its magnetic sensitivity @xcite is a promising venue of biochemical quantum metrology , which however can not be conclusively explored without the fundamental theory of rpm .",
    "this is because even if radical - pairs participating in the natural avian compass are plagued by relaxation , future biomimetic sensors need not be .",
    "finally , there are cases where any agreement with experiments is deluding , i.e. haberkorn s incorrect reaction super - operator forces other system parameters ( like hamiltonian couplings ) to take on incorrect values in order for the theory to match the data .",
    "as will be elaborated in section 5.2 , such an example are the spin dynamics in cidnp , which can not be understood within haberkorn s approach , since the lifetimes of the involved rps are too short for relaxation to set in",
    ".      a general relaxation process can be described by a set of kraus operators @xmath281 , satisfying @xmath282 and transforming the density matrix according to @xmath283 , i.e. the master equation will be augmented with the term @xmath284 . note that @xmath173 is a special case of @xmath285 resulting from the following three kraus operators : @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 , with @xmath289 .    the simplest way to make",
    "our point is to assume that besides the fundamental s - t dephasing process , we have an independent relaxation mechanism of rate @xmath290 , being described by the same kraus operators @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 . defining , which takes as input an operator and produces a number .",
    "in contrast , the calligraphic @xmath294 takes as input an operator and produces another operator . ]",
    "the super - operator @xmath295 , we use to find that @xmath296 obeys the equation = -ic-_cc[drcdt ] , where @xmath297 , and we defined @xmath298 with @xmath192 . taking the trace of , we find that @xmath299 , where @xmath300 .",
    "we finally define the `` genuine '' s - t decoherence rate as @xmath301 .",
    "this describes the decay of s - t coherence due to all effects other than the changing normalization of @xmath0 . for the considered example",
    "it is @xmath302 .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is the rate at which s - t coherence is generated by the hamiltonian , @xmath296 will quickly ( compared to the reaction time ) decay to zero , and thus @xmath305 .",
    "hence the traditional theory will provide a consistent description of the dynamics .",
    "the form of haberkorn s reaction operator can be simply phrased as follows : singlet products originate from singlet radical - pairs , and triplet products originate from triplet radical - pairs .",
    "this reasoning obliterates the very concepts of quantum superposition and quantum measurement and is unphysical on many grounds , one related to the well understood quantum state reconstruction .",
    "suppose we are provided with a number of qubits all prepared in the state @xmath306 , which however is not disclosed to us .",
    "suppose then that we perform a measurement of each qubit either in the basis b1=@xmath307 or in the basis b2=@xmath308 .",
    "measuring in b1 , the measurement outcomes will be 0 or 1 and we should conclude that the preparation state was @xmath309 or @xmath310 . measuring in b2 , the outcome will always be 0 , and we should conclude that the prepared state was @xmath136 . repeating this many times we should conclude that we are provided with qubits in all three states @xmath136 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 . in other words , based on the dictum of identifying the pre - measurement state with the post - measurement state , we would never be able to use the statistical - interpretation of quantum measurements and reconstruct the original state preparation .",
    "we will again consider an rp ensemble initially prepared in the state @xmath261 , not undergoing any s - t mixing ( @xmath43 ) and having @xmath250 .",
    "haberkorn s theory predicts that the rp state remains pure at all times , with the ensemble consisting at time @xmath104 of @xmath311 radical - pairs in the state |_t=1(e^-k_st2|s+|t_0)[psi1 ] at @xmath42 it is @xmath312 , which is not entangled .",
    "however , it is seen from that _ without any coherent operation _ on the radical - pairs , they spontaneously acquire a non - zero entanglement while _ coherently _ evolving to the maximally entangled and non - reactive triplet state @xmath61 .",
    "this is unphysical .",
    "the caveat , as will be explained in detail in section 6.2 , is that an irreversible reaction causing population leakage is wrongly understood to coherently operate on the amplitudes of the rp quantum state .",
    "in contrast , in our approach an rp in the state @xmath107 is ( i ) either projected to @xmath58 , or ( ii ) projected to @xmath61 , or ( iii ) recombines to a singlet neutral product , or ( iv ) stays put at @xmath107 .",
    "the probabilities of ( i ) and ( ii ) are the same ( see section 3.8.1 ) , so together they represent a balanced mixture of maximally entangled states , the mixture carrying zero entanglement . event ( iii ) produces net entanglement , but it does so by an incoherent operation , related to measurement - induced entanglement , to be addressed in more detail elsewhere .",
    "in section 3.5 we discussed the interpretation of in terms of single - molecule quantum trajectories involving three possible events , ( i ) singlet projection with probability @xmath149 , ( ii ) triplet projection with probability @xmath150 , and ( iii ) hamiltonian evolution with probability @xmath142 .",
    "however , the full quantum dynamics include both s - t dephasing and recombination .",
    "to account for the latter , we have to augment the quantum trajectories , which are now formed by 5 possible events taking place within @xmath44 : ( e1 ) singlet projection with probability @xmath149 , ( e2 ) triplet projection with probability @xmath150 , ( e3 ) singlet recombination with probability @xmath176 , ( e4 ) triplet recombination with probability @xmath177 , and ( e5 ) hamiltonian evolution with probability @xmath313 .",
    "does the average of many quantum trajectories reproduce our master equation ? moreover , which are the quantum trajectories in haberkorn s approach , and",
    "do they reproduce haberkorn s master equation ?      the concept of quantum trajectories , well known in quantum optics @xcite , was only recently introduced @xcite in spin chemistry . in any case ,",
    "in @xcite we presented a significant constraint to be met when one attempts a quantum - trajectory analysis of haberkorn s master equation .",
    "the intuitive understanding in spin chemistry was that rps evolve _ unitarily _ under the action of @xmath2 until the instant they recombine into neutral reaction products .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that this physical picture _ must _ be advocated if haberkorn s theory is to be consistent in the special case @xmath94 .",
    "first of all , what is so special about this case ?",
    "the rates @xmath40 and @xmath41 are rp - specific parameters entering the master equation , which obviously must be valid for all radical - pairs , those for which @xmath94 and those for which @xmath93 . in fact the latter are abundant in photosynthetic reaction centers , as will be presented in the following section . moreover , quantum dynamics are non - trivial in this case of asymmetric recombination rates .",
    "in contrast , rp quantum dynamics simplify a lot when @xmath87 , where rp population decays exponentially at a rate @xmath88 , _ without the decay affecting the state of the surviving rps_. haberkorn s master equation now becomes : d / dt =- i[h,]-k[drdtk ] defining a new density matrix @xmath314 by @xmath274 , it is @xmath275 $ ] .",
    "thus , apart from an exponential decay of the normalization @xmath91 , the density matrix @xmath0 evolves unitarily .",

    "as promised , we have arrived at a significant constraint limiting our freedom to define haberkorn s quantum trajectories , namely that in the special case @xmath94 , haberkorn s master equation is consistent with quantum trajectories in which a radical - pair just evolves unitarily until it recombines . at this point",

    "[ diz]d , haberkorn s theory is immediately ruled out .",
    "however , at early times the inconsistency is rather innocuous in this case .",
    "for example , the reaction time ( 1/e of the initial population ) read off the plot is about @xmath337 and @xmath338 for the monte carlo and the master equation , respectively , which are not alarmingly different .    to summarize , using haberkorn s master equation to extract physical parameters of photosynthetic reaction centers from cidnp data will lead to significantly skewed numbers , since both the structure of the hamiltonian and the relevant couplings will be forced by the incorrect reaction terms of to attain unphysical values in order to match the data .",
    "the level of the discrepancy can be gauged by comparing our monte carlo result for @xmath336 ( -2410 ) with haberkorn s master equation result ( -4250 ) . if the scientific community studying photosynthetic reaction centers is content with somewhat better than order - of - magnitude estimates of the relevant physical parameters , haberkorn s approach is adequate .",
    "if precision is of interest , the conventional approach is inadequate .",
    "finally , our master equation succeeds in matching our monte carlo , which precisely captures the full quantum dynamics at the single molecule picture , at the level of 50% for @xmath334 .",
    "this constitutes significant progress in establishing a fundamentally sound understanding of rp quantum dynamics , but this level of consistency is still not good enough . the weakness of our master equation is traced to the definitions of @xmath204 and @xmath236 , which will be refined in forthcoming works .",
    "soon after our first paper @xcite challenging the traditional theory , yet another master equation based on quantum measurement considerations @xcite , and a microscopic derivation of the traditional master equation @xcite appeared in the literature .",
    "to these was recently added a study @xcite using the formalism of quantum maps .",
    "in @xcite the authors use the operator sum approach to evolve the rp density matrix , encapsulating the physics of the atom being `` watched '' by an array of photomultipliers ( section 3.3 ) , namely the assumption that a radical - pair that could recombine in e.g. the singlet channel , and was not observed to do so , is projected to the triplet state .",
    "this assumption derives from considering the rp spin degrees of freedom to be directly coupled to a physically observable environment , like the atom is coupled to the observable radiation field .    put differently , considering heisenberg s measurement chain depicted in fig .",
    "[ cut ] , where a quantum system interacts with an apparatus , which interacts with another apparatus and so on and forth until registering an actual measurement , the approach of jones & hore is tantamount to cutting the chain right after the first apparatus .",
    "according to our understanding this is physically impossible , because the first apparatus is realized by the unobservable vibrational excitations .",
    "these are coupled to the observable phonon bath ( second apparatus ) , so we can physically register the recombination event only with the detection of a phonon resulting from the decay of the vibrational excitations to the ground state .",
    "the absence of such a detection can not unambiguously condition the radical - pair s state as in the atom watched by photodetectors , because of the unobservable possibility of virtual transitions to the vibrational reservoir and back to the rp .",
    "thus , in our approach , the presence of the intermediate `` apparatus '' between the radical - pair and the final product detection ameliorates the influence of the `` null recombination - product measurement '' on the rp s state . in the jones - hore approach , this influence is intensified due to the absence of the intermediate apparatus .",
    "this is why the jones - hore theory predicts a higher s - t dephasing rate than our theory .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite performed pulsed - epr spectroscopy on a carotenoid - porphyrin - fullerene triad to find the s - t dephasing rate to be lower than the jones - hore prediction , ruling out the theory , since the theoretically expected fundamental relaxation rate always sets a lower bound to measured rates .",
    "the s - t dephasing rate measured in @xcite is consistent with haberkorn s prediction , apart from a postulated extra relaxation mechanism attributed to g - anisotropy .",
    "the magnitude of this extra relaxation rate is roughly estimated in @xcite to be factor of 2 or 3 ( depending on temperature ) higher than haberkorn s dephasing rate .",
    "even if this attribution turns out to be correct , it is already understood that in the presence of strong hyperfine relaxation , haberkorn s theory is expected to be a good approximation .",
    "hyperfine relaxation is for s - t mixing in radical - pairs what doppler broadening is for atoms . in order to study natural broadening of an atomic transition",
    ", doppler broadening must be eliminated . in radical - pairs , in order to study the fundamental s - t dephasing we have introduced , one needs to experiment with molecules not suffering hyperfine relaxation _ within their lifetime_. the molecule used in @xcite is not one of those .    in contrast , another experiment @xcite reported evidence of a non - trivial state evolution of non - recombining radical - pairs , the rate of which appears to be consistent with the jones - hore prediction .",
    "a global and more detailed analysis of these two conflicting experiments will be undertaken elsewhere .",
    "the microscopic derivation of ivanov et al . in @xcite seamlessly arrives at habekorn s master equation .",
    "the problem is that this derivation describes a system other than radical - pairs .",
    "this is because the authors consider the neutral reaction products to be _ coherently _ coupled to the radical pairs .",

    "6 , it is clear that the presence of the continuous manifold of vibrational excitations of the neutral products prohibits any coherence between reactants and products , as long as by `` product '' we identify the physically observable neutral ground state . so is the master equation a matter of semantics , i.e. defining what is the reaction product ?",
    "not really .",
    "again , it is the physics of the virtual transitions to the intermediate states and back to the rp that do not allow one to proclaim the reaction is over just counting on a non - zero amplitude of the intermediate states .",

    "suppose then that we keep registering photons for a consecutive time interval @xmath357 , this time putting a @xmath60 phase shifter in front one of the two slits . if we were to observe the two runs individually , we would see two perfect interference patterns shifted with respect to each other . on the other hand , if we wait to register all photons from the two consecutive runs , and then look at the observation screen , there will be no interference pattern . if one is presented with the final picture",
    ", one will conclude that the light source was incoherent .",
    "this is the analogy of the proper mixture discussed before .",
    "in contrast , if one performs this experiment , again with perfectly coherent light , and installs a measurement apparatus after the slits acquiring complete which - path information , the interference pattern will genuinely disappear .",
    "this is the analog of the improper mixture discussed above .",
    "going back to the bewildered experimenter who is provided the mixture @xmath356 , while all his global measurements will lead him to expect 50% unreacted triplet rps , he will be surprised to finally measure 25% .",
    "to our understanding , so far proper and improper mixtures were more of an epistemological curiosity rather than of practical utility .",
    "that is , we are unaware of any quantum science experiments able to differentiate proper from improper mixtures .",
    "we will close this review with a conjecture , the proof of which we leave as a problem to be addressed in the more abstract context of the foundations of quantum physics . _ leaky quantum systems , in which the leakage depends non - linearly on the quantum - state , can differentiate between proper and improper mixtures_.",
    "we hope to have convinced the reader that radical - pair reactions indeed constitute an ideal paradigm for quantum biology , since they require for their understanding the whole conceptual toolset of quantum information science , even touching upon the foundations of quantum physics .",
    "the complex quantum dynamics of radical - pair reactions emerge from the interplay of coherent spin dynamics and incoherent electron transfer reactions , rendering this system both open and leaky . to our knowledge , this is rather unusual in quantum science , and conceptually quite challenging , explaining _ in part _ the current lack of consensus in the scientific community on the quantum foundations of rpm .",
    "it is true that the last several years have witnessed several exciting discoveries making the case of quantum biology .",
    "we feel that the synthesis of the two seemingly disjoint fields that dominated 20@xmath339 century science , `` quantum '' and `` bio '' , will lead to breakthroughs beyond our current ability to forecast .",
    "hence we will be more than content if this review inspires many other researchers to join this tremendously exciting scientific endeavor .",
