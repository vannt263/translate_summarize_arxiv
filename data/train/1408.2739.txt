    "the ground state fidelity @xcite , a concept stemming from quantum information theory , is the overlap amplitude @xmath4 between two ground state wave functions of the hamiltonian @xmath5 at different values of the coupling parameter @xmath1 .",

    ", this divergence translates into a presence of a peak in @xmath10 at @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 at @xmath8 . assuming a translational invariant system with the unique ground state , perturbed by a local operator @xmath14 , one obtains @xcite the following connection @xmath15 between the fs and the reduced correlation function @xmath16 where the imaginary time evolution is defined by @xmath17 , averages are taken in the ground state @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the short - range ( lattice ) cutoff .",
    "expression ( [ fs - corr1 ] ) diverges at @xmath8 as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the scaling dimension of @xmath22 at the critical point and @xmath23 is the dynamic exponent , as long as @xmath24 . at @xmath25",
    "there is only a logarithmic divergence @xcite , and with the further increase of @xmath21 the fs remains finite at the critical point .",
    "the above arguments  @xcite show that the fs must be insensitive not only against marginal and irrelevant perturbations ( @xmath26 ) , but even against relevant perturbations with @xmath27 . in the case of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so it has been initially concluded @xcite that transitions of this type can not be detected by means of the finite - size scaling analysis of the fs .",
    "a prominent example of the bkt transition is the transition at the isotropic point @xmath30 in the so - called xxz spin-@xmath31 chain defined by the hamiltonian @xmath32 where @xmath33 are spin-@xmath31 operators at site @xmath34 .",
    "this conclusion has been apparently defeated by yang @xcite and fjrestad @xcite .",
    "their approach uses the fact that the low - energy effective theory of the model ( [ ham - xxz ] ) ( as well as of many other gapless 1d systems ) , obtained by the abelian bosonization @xcite , is the so - called luttinger liquid ( ll ) described by the hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the compact bosonic field ( @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is its conjugate momentum . the velocity @xmath39 and the ll parameter @xmath40 are generally functions of the original coupling @xmath1 that have to be obtained as fixed points of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations .",
    "alternatively , they can be extracted from the knowledge of exact long - distance behavior of correlation functions .",
    "for the xxz model ( [ ham - xxz ] ) , exact correlator asymptotics is known from the bethe ansatz , which yields @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 @xcite . since the effective model ( [ ham - ll ] ) is quadratic",
    ", one can explicitly calculate the fidelity @xmath43 and obtain for the fs in the thermodynamic limit @xmath44 the dependence @xmath45 is singular at @xmath30 , which leads to the divergence of the fs @xmath46 .",
    "this direct calculation of overlaps might seem questionable since the connection between the wave functions of the initial model and its fixed - point low - energy theory is not so clear .",
    "instead , one can use an alternative derivation due to sirker @xcite based on the relation ( [ fs - corr1 ] ) . indeed , using the effective hamiltonian ( [ ham - ll ] ) , the perturbation @xmath47 can be represented as @xmath48 where @xmath49 the first term in ( [ oper ] ) commutes with @xmath50 and thus gives no contribution into @xmath51 @xcite , but the second term contributes the prefactor leading exactly to the form ( [ ll - yang ] ) .",
    "the scaling dimension of the second term is @xmath52 , so the correlator in ( [ fs - corr1 ] ) behaves as @xmath53 the integral in ( [ fs - corr1 ] ) is finite at @xmath8 , and the divergence originates solely from the prefactor .",
    "one can show that this singular behavior of @xmath45 is a generic property of any bkt transition .",
    "the general theory of a bkt transition is given by the hamiltonian ( [ ham - ll ] ) perturbed by the cosine term @xmath54 , where @xmath19 is the lattice cutoff and @xmath55 is the dimensionless coupling .",
    "the proximity to the transition is controlled by the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "it follows from the rg equations @xcite that in the thermodynamic limit the fixed point behavior is @xmath57 , so the fs diverges . in a finite system , however , the rg flow should be stopped at the rg scale @xmath58 , and the derivative of @xmath59 behaves as @xmath60 at @xmath61 , so according to ( [ ll - yang ] ) the fs at the transition should scale as @xmath62    indeed , numerical results show that in the vicinity of the isotropic point the fs exhibits a peak @xcite located at @xmath63 , which moves very slowly towards @xmath30 with increasing @xmath6 , and whose height grows with @xmath6 much faster than corrections in powers of @xmath64 could explain @xcite . a similar behavior has been reported @xcite for the finite - temperature fs , and the results were claimed to be consistent with the @xmath65 behavior , essentially of the same origin as eq .",
    "( [ log2 ] ) ( in the case of an infinite system at finite temperature , the rg flow is stopped at the scale @xmath66 where @xmath67 is some nonuniversal energy scale of the order of the spin exchange energy ) .",
    "recently , for the xxz chain a divergent fs similar to ( [ ll - yang ] ) has been claimed @xcite on the basis of the real - space quantum renormalization group . on the other hand , other authors did not see any divergence in the fs at bkt - type transitions in the spin-@xmath31 xxz chain @xcite and in bosonic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "further , comparison of the fs calculated according to ( [ ll - yang ] ) with the numerical results shows @xcite that in order to fit the data one has to assume the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath19 to be strongly @xmath1-dependent even in the vicinity of the free fermion point @xmath68 .",
    "this controversy is aggravated by the fact that a logarithmic growth is difficult to distinguish numerically from the well known logarithmic finite - size corrections at the bkt transitions .",
    "there is a subtle problem with the above derivation of a diverging fs , immediately revealed by a closer look at the representation ( [ oper ] ) : recalling the original model ( [ ham - xxz ] ) , we see that @xmath69 , so @xmath22 is a bounded operator , while in eq .",
    "( [ oper ] ) the bounded operator @xmath70 carries a prefactor that diverges at @xmath71 independently of any ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this indicates that the divergence might be an artefact of the effective representation ( [ oper ] ) , built on the abelian bosonization and becoming inapplicable in the vicinity of the transition point .",
    "a similar problem is known for the amplitudes of correlation functions calculated by lukyanov @xcite : the amplitudes explode at @xmath71 , meaning that the applicability of the correspondent asymptotics is pushed to larger and larger distances .",
    "the integral ( [ fs - corr1 ] ) is convergent at @xmath72 , so divergences coming from such prefactors may be compensated by terms neglected in eq .",
    "( [ ham - ll ] ) .",
    "generally , one should not rely on divergences stemming from prefactors of operators of the fixed point action ( action where we neglect all irrelevant terms in particular those that may and will lead to cancellation of these spurious divergences in physical quantities ) .",
    "however , infrared divergences due to the correlators of the fixed point action are physical , since irrelevant terms , being harmless at long distances , can not compensate them .",
    "assuming , from the boundedness of @xmath22 , that the amplitude @xmath73 in the correlator ( [ gxt ] ) remains finite at @xmath71 , one returns to the initial conclusion that the fs at the transition stays finite as well .",
    "finite - size corrections to @xmath74 might be naively estimated in a standard way by exploiting the conformal symmetry : substitution @xmath75 $ ] in the correlator ( [ gxt ] ) , mapping infinite space - time onto a stripe , yields @xmath76 , \\quad \\chi_{0}(\\lambda)\\sim \\frac{\\pi a(\\lambda)}{2a } .\\ ] ] although numerical results @xcite for the model ( [ ham - xxz ] ) in the gapless phase @xmath77 are indeed consistent with ( [ fss - away ] ) , this type of finite - size scaling certainly breaks down close to the observed peak in the fs @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic modification of the correlator @xmath78 , which can take place at the isotropic point @xmath30 , would affect the finite - size corrections in ( [ fss - away ] ) only by changing them from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , not solving the problem .    to obtain the correct finite - size scaling of @xmath74 close to the su(2)-symmetric bkt transition point @xmath30 , it is convenient to use non - abelian bosonization @xcite .    in non - abelian approach ,",
