    "stellar populations are used as tools to probe star formation histories in galaxies .",
    "the bulge of our galaxy , together with that of our local group galaxy companion m31 , have colors , metallicities , and kinematics which are typical of early type spiral bulges .",
    "although our knowledge about bulges has improved during the last decade , little is known about their formation and evolution , especially in connection with the other components of galaxies ( freeman 1993 ) .",
    "there is , however , recent evidence that bulges originate , on rather short time scales , during the very first phases of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , in our galaxy , the analysis of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of star clusters located within five degrees of the galactic center has revealed a metallicity distribution similar to that of the surrounding galactic field stars ( barbuy et  al .",
    "in addition , the metal - rich bulge clusters have been demonstrated to have the same age as the inner - halo metal - rich old globular cluster 47  tucanae ( ortolani et  al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the globular cluster system of m31 , which is about twice as rich as the galactic one , is among the most studied cluster systems in external galaxies ( harris 1991 ) .",
    "however , our knowledge comes mainly from the photometric and/or spectroscopic integrated properties of these clusters .",
    "a few pioneering attempts have been made to obtain cluster cmds from the ground , but even with good seeing at the cfht , heasley et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) and christian & heasley ( 1991 ) were only able to reach the upper part of the red giant branch , without reaching the horizontal branches of g1 and g219 , two of the brightest m31 clusters .    with the advent of the hubble space telescope ( hst )",
    ", the situation has changed .",
    "the cmds of 10 globular clusters in m31 have been published , reaching about one magnitude below the horizontal branch ( fusi pecci et  al .",
    "1996 , ajhar et  al .",
    "1996 , rich et  al .",
    "1996 , holland et  al . 1997 ) .",
    "these clusters are mainly located in the halo of m31 , where contamination from foreground stars and the m31 stellar disk is minimized .",
    "the closest to the center are g108 ( with [ fe / h]=@xmath20.94 ) and g280 ( with [ fe / h]=@xmath20.4 ) , located at 19.2  = 4.81 kpc and 18.4  = 4.59 kpc from the m31 center , respectively .",
    "recently , jablonka et al . ( 1992 , 1998 ) obtained integrated spectrophotometric observations for a sample of globular clusters in the bulge of m31 , looking for possible extreme cases of metal enrichment , and consequently naturally investigated the inner regions of m31 .",
    "the two clusters g170 and g177 belong to their sample .",
    "g177 exhibits metallic absorption features which are as strong as those characterizing the central regions of elliptical galaxies ; with its higher - than - solar metallicity , this cluster clearly challenged the conventional view of old globular clusters as metal - poor objects , although such metal - rich clusters seem to be rare .",
    "another cluster , g198 , as super - metal rich as g177 and at about the same distance from the m31 galactic center , had been identified by huchra et al .",
    "( 1991 ) in an independent spectroscopic analysis .",
    "g170 , located slightly further away has about a solar metallicity .    as a first attempt",
    "to learn more about the outstanding properties of extremely metal - rich globular clusters , we applied for deep imaging observations with the hst , taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and red sensitivity of the planetary camera of wfpc2 , in order to build the cmds of these three m31 bulge clusters , all of them located within about six arcmin from the center of this galaxy .",
    "these cluster data , so far the closest to the center of m31 , allow insight into the questions of metallicities , age and link between bulge field and cluster stellar populations . given their central location and consequently their very high stellar density , they challenge the best observational capabilities .",
    "g170 , being slightly further away from the center , is surrounded by a lower density of field stars than the other two clusters , and was meant to be a relative calibrator .",
    "a fourth cluster , g1 , has been observed during the same program ; its properties , viz .",
    "cmd , structural parameters , dynamical mass estimate , and m / l ratio , will be addressed in another paper ( meylan et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  2 presents the observations and data reduction ; section  3 describes the image deconvolution technique used ; section  4 analyses and discusses the results , while section  5 summarizes the highlights of this study .",
    "we obtained hst wfpc2 images with the f555w ( @xmath0 ) and f814w ( @xmath1 ) filters , during cycles  5 and  6 ( program ids = 5907 and 6477 ) .",
    "our targets were field and cluster stars around three metal - rich star clusters g170 , g177 , and g198 in the bulge of m31 ( jablonka et al . 1992 ; huchra et al .",
    "the two fields around the star clusters g170 and g177 are located south - west along the major axis of m31 , respectively at 6.1  and 3.2  from the galaxy nucleus ; the third field , around the cluster g198 , is located north - east along the major axis at 3.7  from the galaxy nucleus ( huchra et al .",
    "1991 ; hodge 1981 ) . adopting 1  = 250  pc ( rich & mighell 1995 )",
    ", these angular separations correspond to projected distances of about 1.55 , 0.80 , and 0.92 kpc , respectively .",
    "these distances are summarized in columns 2 and 3 of table  1 .",
    "columns 4 and 5 of the same table provide the @xmath0 magnitude and @xmath3 color of each cluster , from battistini et  al .",
    "fig .1 in jablonka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) gives the location of our fields .",
    "figure  1 displays , on the left , for each of the three clusters , an area of 64  @xmath4  64 pixels from the original pc frames , centered on the clusters . with the pc pixel size of 0.045/pix",
    ", this corresponds to squares of 2.88   in size .",
    "although resolved , all three clusters appear extremely compact , with very steep surface brightness profiles and extremely crowded and bright cores .",
    "since all images are slightly saturated in the core of the clusters this prevents the determination of the cluster structural parameters . in any case , these three clusters are extremely concentrated , being probably close to core collapse .",
    "our data represent one of the highest resolution images obtained so far of the innermost parts of m31 for either cluster or field stars . while the high spatial resolution of the hst is necessary when studying crowded fields , its unfortunate under - sampling limits the effectiveness of the instrument in actually resolving blends of stars .",
    "the consequences of various samplings on the study of crowded stellar fields is investigated by renzini ( 1998 ) , who shows by clear physical considerations that the main limiting factor is the number of stars per resolution element . for whatever available spatial resolution provided by a given telescope ,",
    "the sampling of the images as determined by the ccd still determines the number of degrees of freedom ( pixels ) , as compared with the number of unknowns ( star intensities ) .    in the center of m31 ,",
    "the number of unknowns is close to that of the available degrees of freedom , making it difficult to obtain the photometry of individual stars . in this context , the photometry is affected not only by the photon noise , but also by systematic errors .",
    "systematics translate into biased photometry and may even depend on the algorithm used .",
    "for example , the way the sky subtraction is performed influences significantly the results in images where basically no single pixel provides an accurate estimate of the sky brightness . an algorithm which treats the sky background globally ( i.e. , the sky background is an image ) will usually not produce the same photometry as an algorithm which computes a local sky value",
    ". the sky level will usually be _ systematically _ over- or under - estimated , hence leading to biased photometry ( such an effect , is of course best seen in faint stars , close to the sky level ) .",
    "another source of systematic errors comes from the way heavy blends are handled by the photometry software : an algorithm which does not `` see '' very blended stars will tend to overestimate the flux of multiple point sources identified as one single source .",
    "while correcting for the net effect of such systematics is extremely difficult , one may still be able to quantify their magnitude . for this purpose",
    ", we performed our analysis with two very different algorithms : the allframe procedure developed by p. stetson ( 1994 ) , and the `` mcs image deconvolution algorithm '' developed by magain , courbin & sohy ( 1998 ) .",
    "both allframe and mcs have been run on the 64  @xmath4  64-pixel ( 2.88  @xmath4  2.88 ) sub - areas of the original pc frames .",
    "the small size of these images has been chosen to minimize the cpu consumption of the mcs method .",
    "the clusters are centered and fully included in these subimages .",
    "reference sub - areas in the same pc frames , hereafter called control fields , with similar 64  @xmath4  64-pixel size , have been chosen at about 10   away from the clusters , far enough to ensure that no cluster star would intervene , though not too far away , so that the conditions of analysis remain the same .",
    "the directions between cluster fields and control fields are also chosen to minimize any effect induced by the strong gradient of the bulge stellar field .",
    "table  1 gathers the coordinates of the cluster and control fields in pixel units of the pc frames .",
    "as allframe is now widely known and since our use of it is already described in jablonka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we mainly focus in the following section on the description of our use of the mcs deconvolution algorithm .",
    "the mcs deconvolution algorithm is applied to the combined @xmath0 and @xmath1 frames , viz . , 4 frames in each of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-bands .",
    "figure  1 ( left ) displays for each cluster the 64  @xmath4  64-pixel area centered on the cluster , from one of the the @xmath1-band images , after the classical hst pipeline data reduction procedure . figure  1 ( right )",
    "displays the resulting image after the mcs deconvolution .",
    "the psf is known to be variable across the wfpc2 field with a scale of about  30 .",
    "consequently , the psf can be safely assumed to be constant over each of our small 64  @xmath4  64-pixel areas , but different psfs were computed for each cluster and each control field .",
    "these psfs were obtained from the grid of numerical psf estimates made available to us by p. stetson from the cepheid key project .",
    "the f555w and f814w instrumental magnitudes were converted to johnson - cousins   @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes , using the zero points in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the color terms given by hughes et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) for their key project wfpc2 data .",
    "no aperture correction was applied .",
    "the resulting color transformation equations are :    @xmath5    our cluster and control fields fall close to four psf estimates on the psf grid , so that we were able to compute the final psfs used for the deconvolution on a grid of pixels a factor of two smaller than the original pixel size ; this is similar to the `` drizzling '' procedure used to over - sample images , using various dithered frames of the same field ( fruchter & hook 1998 ) .",
    "the final pixel size adopted to sample the deconvolved images is then 0.0225 .",
    "adopting this smaller pixel size is essential when deconvolving slightly under - sampled data as those from wfpc2 .",
    "we can then improve the spatial resolution beyond the limits in principle imposed by the pixel size in the original data frame and reach with 2 ( smaller ) pixels a final resolution equal to 0.045   fwhm , without violating the sampling theorem .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have applied the mcs deconvolution algorithm to three m31 bulge globular clusters .",
    "this deconvolution appears as a very efficient method in such extremely dense regions , but still rather demanding in terms of computing time , so we have been limited to small regions .",
    "however , our initial results are already very promising .",
    "our radial star counts for the cluster and control fields clearly show that we have resolved the clusters : this is the first time that cluster stars have been resolved in the bulge of another galaxy so close to the center .    from the deconvolved photometry , we clearly see the cluster red giant branches , though we do not detect their horizontal branches . taking into account systematic biases introduced by crowding ,",
    "there are no significant differences between the cmds for the three clusters .",
    "moreover , there is no apparent difference between the cluster and their respective control field cmds . from the rgb slopes and the difference in @xmath1 magnitude between the hb and rgb , all three clusters have roughly solar metallicity ,",
    "making them similar to ngc  6528 or ngc  6553 in our galaxy ; by inference , the same is true of the mean field population .",
    "we thus conclude that the m31 bulge clusters and field stars originate from the same material .",
    "they are representative of old , metal - rich populations .",
    "similar results have been found in our galaxy , where it becomes more and more apparent that the metallicity distributions of field stars and globular clusters in the bulge are identical ( ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ; barbuy et al . 1998 ) . from a detailed study of the element ratios for two stars in ngc 6553 , barbuy et al .",
    "( 1999 ) conclude that the galactic bulge underwent rapid star formation and chemical enrichment .",
    "certainly our work corroborates this view .",
    "bulges appear to be old , metal - rich systems , similar in many respects to elliptical galaxies .",
    "there is mounting evidence that most stars in ellipticals and bulges formed at high redshift z@xmath6 @xmath7 3 ( see review by renzini & cimmati 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we have pushed hst to its limits , and m31 seems to be the furthest galaxy for which we can use hst in this way .",
    "higher spatial resolution studies of bulge populations in m31 and more distant galaxies awaits adaptive optics on 810 m ground - based telescopes , and eventually the ngst .",
