    "many systems in nature or society can be well described by small world networks ( swn ) , which were first proposed by watts and strogatz in ref .",
    "swns are those intermediate between a regular lattice and a random network",
    ". they can be realized by introducing a very small portion of long range links to a regular lattice .",
    "such networks appear as small - worlds like random graphs , i.e. , with a small average node - node distance that grows logarithmically with the network size . meanwhile they also have usually large clustering coefficients @xcite .",
    "since the first model system was proposed@xcite , a large literature has appeared and the properties of various models and processes on swns have been extensively studied , including percolation , coloring , coupled oscillators , iterated games , diffusion processes , epidemic processes , and spin models ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . for example , it has been recently found that some spin - lattice models belonging to different universality classes now show mean - field behavior on swns@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recently zhu _ et al .",
    "_ introduced swn effect to critical dynamics @xcite , and the investigation has been extended to the kinetic properties of the spin models .    according to glauber s and kawasaki s theory @xcite , the time evolution of the order parameters",
    "can be described by a markov process with a specific choice of the dynamic mechanism .",
    "two mechanisms have been extensively studied : glauber s single - spin flip mechanism@xcite with the order parameter nonconserved and kawasaki s spin - pair exchange mechanism@xcite with the order parameter conserved . in the past decade , an interesting problem has been attracting much attention , i.e. , the competing glauber - type and kawasaki - type dynamics .",
    "we briefly explain the physical ground : glauber s mechanism with probability @xmath0 is used to simulate the contact of the system with a heat bath and favors a low energy state",
    ". meanwhile kawasaki s mechanism with probability @xmath1 simulates an external energy flux and , naturally , favors a high energy state",
    ". then there will a competition between the two dynamics .",
    "this competing mechanism has been applied to the spin models@xcite , and interesting self - organization has been reported .",
    "all these works have considered regular lattice , and to extend the investigation to the small - world networks should be of interest . at the same time , such a study may also have theoretical meaning . in zhu s work@xcite",
    ", it has been found that the swn effect may have different types of influence on the glauber - type dynamics and the kawasaki - type dynamics . by focusing on the competition of the dynamics , it is easy for us to further understand the influence of the swn effect and highlight the disparities between the dynamics .    in this article",
    "we investigate the swn effect on the competing dynamics , and we demonstrate the conclusions by comparing the phase diagrams obtained with and without the swn effect . before we present the calculations , we first describe the prototypes of swns that are used in the present study , and then briefly review the generalized competing mechanism .    _ the swn models _ : after the first prototype of swn was proposed by watts and strogatz@xcite , there appear a variety of model systems that can be categorized into the two groups , i.e. , with the total number of links increased or conserved",
    ". correspondingly , in the present research we study two specific , while representative models described below : ( 1 ) in a one - dimensional loop , for example , each randomly selected pair of vertices are additionally connected with probability @xmath2 ; ( 2 ) the vertices are visited one after another , and each of its links in the clockwise sense is left in place with probability @xmath3 and is reconnected to a randomly selected other node with probability @xmath4 .",
    "networks of higher dimensions can be similarly built .",
    "we call the first model adding - type small - world network ( a - swn ) and the second one rewiring - type network ( r - swn ) .    _ the generalized competing mechanism _ : glauber s flip mechanism and kawasaki s exchange mechanism were originally presented for the ising model .",
    "recently they have been generalized to single - spin transition mechanism@xcite and spin - pair redistribution mechanism@xcite , respectively , which can be applied to arbitrary spin systems .",
    "correspondingly there is the generalized competing dynamics@xcite , which provides a basis for the discussions in this article . with the competing mechanism",
    ", the master equation can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the single - spin transition with probability @xmath0 and @xmath7 denotes the spin - pair redistribution with probability @xmath1 . for your convenience",
    "we list in sec .",
    "ii and iii some important equations of the transition mechanism and the redistribution mechanism , the details of which can be found in respective references .",
    "in this article we study the generalized competing dynamics in the framework of the kinetic gaussian model , which is mathematically tractable .",
    "it has been revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the swn effect on the gaussian model is of the mean - field nature . considering this , in the present study a simplified method",
    "is adopted , although a rigorous treatment is possible .    in sec .",

    "comparing fig .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we find both similarities and differences .",
    "the phase diagrams have similar structures while the boundaries may be shifted by the swn effect . in the following",
    "we briefly explain our observations and discuss the nature of the competing mechanism and the swn effect .",
    "first we notice that the phase diagrams are all separated into four regions , with two special temperatures : one is the critical temperature @xmath112 , another is the limit temperature @xmath113  required by the convergence of the integration .",
    "when the swn effect does not exist , @xmath114 is the critical point of the gaussian model , where @xmath39  is the gaussian distribution constant and @xmath115  is the space dimension , and @xmath116  ( since @xmath117 *  * is the region where we can assure the convergence of the integration in the kawasaki - type dynamics of the antiferromagnetic system ) . when the a - swn effect is introduced , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( in the example studied @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ) . *  * when the r - swn effect is introduced , @xmath123and @xmath124  ( in the example studied @xmath120 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 ) .",
    "now we describe the phase behavior : above the critical temperature @xmath127 , one can only observe a disordered state , namely the paramagnetic phase , because of the dominating heat noise .",
    "below critical temperature @xmath128 , the system begins to show some kind of order , and the system behavior is determined by the competition between the glauber - type mechanism which favors a ferromagnetic state , and the kawasaki - type mechanism which favors an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "the result of the competition is subject to two factors , the probability of each mechanism and the temperature .",
    "however , the kawasaki - type dynamics describing an antiferromagnetic gaussian system is limited by the condition @xmath129 , which is necessary for the convergence of the integration . as a result , in the region @xmath130 we can not theoretically obtain the system behavior .",
    "now we discuss how and why the two special temperatures @xmath131  and @xmath132  may be affected by the swn effect .",
    "when the gaussian model is built on a r - swn , the temperature @xmath133 remains the same .",
    "this is because , as is clear in all of the phase diagrams , @xmath131 is determined by the competition between the heat noise and the glauber - type mechanism , which favors a lower energy state",
    ". one important characteristic of the gaussian model is that this temperature can be further determined by the average coordination number .",
    "for example , without the swn effect this temperature is given by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the average coordination number of a @xmath115-dimensional lattice . on a r - swn ,",
    "the average coordination number is not changed when a portion of the regular links are rewired , and thus @xmath131 also remains unchanged .",
    "on the other hand the temperature @xmath136 is lower than the value on a regular network . on r - swn long range links",
    "have made long range spin - pair redistribution possible , and therefore the influence of the kawasaki - type mechanism is enhanced .",
    "thus it is not difficult to understand why on r - swn there is a lower value of the temperature @xmath136 .",
    "when the gaussian model is built on an a - swn , the temperature @xmath137 becomes higher .",
    "as is explained above , this temperature is determined by the average coordination number , which is @xmath138 on a three dimensional a - swn with @xmath139 . at the same time",
    "the temperature @xmath136 is unchanged .",
    "we may explain that it is because the two dynamics are both strengthened , i.e. , by the larger coordination number and the long range spin - pair redistribution , and the temperature that characterizes a certain counterbalance remains the same .",
    "to summarize , in this article we investigate the competing glauber - type and kawasaki - type dynamics on two typical three - dimensional small - world networks , adding - type ( a - swn ) and rewiring -type ( r - swn ) , in the framework of the gaussian model .",
    "we get the evolution of the order parameters , @xmath66 and @xmath140 , and by analyzing the long time asymptotic behavior we draw the phase diagrams . with the competing mechanism ,",
    "there exist two easily identifiable special temperatures .",
    "the influence of the long range links is analyzed : for the glauber - type dynamics , more important is the altered average coordination number while the kawasaki - type dynamics is enhanced by the long range spin interaction and redistribution .",
    "1 the phase diagrams of the three - dimensional gaussian model on ( a ) regular lattice , ( b ) a - swn , and ( c ) r - swn .",
