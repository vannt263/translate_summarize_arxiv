    "the largest known structures in the clustering heirarchy of galaxies are flattened distributions known as `` superclusters '' ( scs ) . the local supercluster ( lsc ) ,",
    "the supercluster of which the galaxy is a member , was initially discussed by de vaucouleurs ( 1953 ) .",
    "since then catalogues containing hundreds of scs have been compiled ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although it seems likely that many , if not most , scs are gravitationally bound structures , they are far from virialized .",
    "never - the - less , small et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently used virial type arguments to place a lower limit on the mass of the corona borealis sc .",
    "the fact that scs are only marginally over - dense , i.e. @xmath13 , further complicates studies of their structures .",
    "while the study of scs is in its infancy , these objects promise to provide important information about the formation of large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "if little is known about the dynamics of scs , even less know about the intra - supercluster ( isc ) medium .",
    "assuming scs have baryon - to - light ratios comparable to rich clusters of galaxies , then one expects a substantial amount of isc gas .",
    "furthermore , the virial temperatures of scs are @xmath14 so it would not be surprising to find `` hard '' ( @xmath15 ) x - ray emission from the isc medium as is the case for the intergalactic medium in rich clusters of galaxies",
    ". most models of structure formation predict the presence of a hot isc , whether it is primoridal , created from winds from an early population of stars , or tidally stripped from merging structures ( @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "estimated temperatures range from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the cooling time for such gas at the expected densities ( @xmath18 ) is much longer than a hubble time ( @xcite ) so it would remain hot today .",
    "there have been several searches for diffuse x - ray emission from scs .",
    "although murray et al .",
    "( 1978 ) claimed that uhuru data showed evidence for isc emission , subsequent observations and analyses have not supported this claim ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . using rosat pspc data bardelli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported the detection of diffuse emission in the region between two clusters in the shapley supercluster . on the other hand , day et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and molnar & birkinshaw ( 1998 ) have placed relatively strong upper limits on the @xmath0 diffuse emission in this supercluster .",
    "while the current upper limits are interesting , they still leave room for a substantial amount of hot isc matter and more sensitive searches are underway .    particularly intriguing",
    "is the result from the cross - correlation analysis of the rosat all - sky survey with the abell catalog .",
    "soltan et al . (",
    "1996 ) found that abell clusters seemed to be associated with diffuse x - ray emission with an extent of @xmath19 .",
    "it is tempting to associate this emssion with hot isc gas ; although , there is as yet no direct evidence for this .",
    "hot isc gas can also leave its signature on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) via the sunyaev - zedovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "hogan ( 1992 ) suggested that the sz effect in superclusters might account for the fluctuations in the cmb observed by the cobe satellite ; however , subsequent analyses have shown that this is not the case ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "molnar and birkinshaw ( 1998 ) used the lack of an sz effect in the cobe dmr data to place an additional constraint on the isc gas in the shapley supercluster while banday et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found no evidence for the sz effect in superclusters using a statistical cross - correlation analysis . because of the large intrinsic fluctuations in the cmb , searches for the sz effect in scs will undoubtedly result in upper limits until the next generation of cmb satellites provide adequate frequency coverage to resolve the two effects .",
    "searches for isc gas in the local supercluster ( lsc ) have the advantage of much higher integrated signal , however , are frustrated by the presence of other large - scale structure in the x - ray sky .",
    "shafer ( 1983 ) and boldt ( 1987 ) reported evidence for large - scale structure in the heao 1 a2 @xmath0 data which is roughly consistent with either the compton - getting dipole expected from the earth s motion with respect to the cmb or general emission from the direction of the center of the lsc .",
    "subsequent analyses ( @xcite ) demonstrated that compton - getting dipole adequately accounts for this large - scale structure ; however , the direction of the dipole was determined to be in a somewhat different direction than that of the cmb dipole .",
    "jahoda and mushotzky ( 1989 ) found evidence for enhanced @xmath0 emission from the direction of the great attractor which is in the same general direction as the compton - getting dipole .",
    "in addition , jahoda ( 1993 ) has found evidence for high lattitude @xmath0 emission from the galaxy as well as emission associated with the superglactic plane ( the plane of the lsc ) , the latter of which is particularly relevant to the analysis presented in the this paper .    in the following sections we present evidence that there is enhanced emission in the supergalactic plane and that this emission is distinct from the other large - scale structures indicated above . to the extent that this is true , we will argue that the emission is diffuse and not associated with galaxies or other compact x - ray sources in the plane .",
    "it is , of course , possible that the emission is due to still larger scale structure of the type discussed by miyaji & boldt ( 1990 ) and lahav , piran , & treyer ( 1997 ) or even to the chance allignment of fluctuations in the x - ray background ( xrb ) ; although , we argue that the latter is unlikely .",
    "these possibilites will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the heao1 a2 experiment measured the surface brightness of the x - ray background in the @xmath21 band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present data set was constructed from the output of two medium energy detectors ( med ) with different fields of view ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and two high energy detectors ( hed3 ) with these same fields of view .",
    "the data were collected during the six month period beginning on day 322 of 1977 .",
    "counts from the four detectors were combined and binned in 24,576 @xmath24 pixels in an equatorial quadrilateralized spherical cube projection on the sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combined map has a spectral resolution of approximately @xmath25 ( @xcite ) and is shown in galactic coordinates in figure 1 .",
    "the effective point spread function ( psf ) of the map was determined by averaging the psfs of 75 heao1 point sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "the composite psf is well fitted by a gaussian with a full width , half maximum of @xmath26 .",
    "this value will be important in estimating the effective noise in the maximum liklihood fits of  3.4 . because of the pixelization",
    ", the psf varies somewhat with location on the sky ; however , this has little effect on noise estimates so we assume a constant psf .    in order to remove the effects of both points source and large - scale structure , more than half",
    "the map was flagged and not included in the fits described in  3 .",
    "the dominant feature in the heao map is the galaxy ( see figure 1 ) so all data within @xmath27 of the galactic plane and , in addition , within @xmath28 of the galactic center were cut from the map .",
    "in addition , @xmath29 diameter regions around @xmath30 discrete x - ray sources with @xmath25 fluxes larger than @xmath31 ( @xcite ) were removed .",
    "the resulting `` cleaned '' map covered about 50% the sky . in order to identify additional point sources ,",
    "the map itself was searched for `` sources '' that exceeded the nearby background by a specified amount .",
    "this was accomplished by first averaging each pixel with its @xmath32 neighbors ( note that the quadrilaterized cube format lays out the pixels on an approximately square array ) and then comparing this value with the median value of the next nearest @xmath33 pixels .",
    "pixels within the flagged galactic region are ignored .",
    "if the average flux associated with a given pixel exceeds the median flux of the background , then all 25 pixels are flagged and removed from further consideration .",
    "these flagged regions correspond approximately to a @xmath34 patch .",
    "this proceedure is not done iteratively , i.e. each comparison is made on the basis of the original map with only the galaxy flagged .",
    "cuts were made at several levels corresponding to average fluxes of from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the most extreme cut corresponds to an equivalent point source flux of @xmath37 and results in @xmath38 of the sky being flagged . at this level , most of the `` sources '' cut are either noise fluctuations or fluctuations in the x - ray background . in any case , the results of  3.5 are largely insensitive to these cuts .",
    "only one large - scale correction to the map , the compton - getting dipole , was made apriori .",
    "if the dipole moment of the cosmic microwave background is a kinematic effect , as it has been widely interpreted ( @xcite ) , then the x - ray background should possess a similar dipole structure ( compton - getting effect ) with an amplitude of @xmath39 .",
    "as discuseed in  1 , evidence for this structure is found in the heao map ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cleaned map was corrected for this effect ; however , the results of  3.5 are the same even if the amplitude and direction of the dipole are fit from the data .    the presence of three other sources of large - scale structure in the x - ray map has been noted . a linear time drift in detector sensivity ( @xcite ) results in effective large - scale structure of known form but unknown amplitude . in addition , the @xmath25 background shows evidence of high latitude galactic emission as well as emission associated with the supergalactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "models for all three of these contributions are simultaneously fit to the data as is discussed in  3.4 .    because of the ecliptic longitude scan pattern of the heao satellite , sky coverage and , therefore , photon shot noise are not uniform",
    ". however , the mean variance of the cleaned , corrected map , @xmath40 , is considerably larger than the mean variance of photon shot noise , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the x - ray map is dominated by `` real '' structure ( not photon shot noise ) .",
    "for this reason , we chose to weight the pixels equally in all subsequent analyses .",
    "at least one of the a-2 detectors changed sensivity by @xmath43 in the six month interval of the current data set ( @xcite ) . because of the ecliptic scan pattern of the heao satellite , this results in a large - scale pattern in the sky which varies with ecliptic longitude with a period of @xmath44 . if the drift is assumed to be linear , the form of the resulting large - scale structure in the map is completely determined .",
    "a linear drift of unkown amplitude is taken into account by constructing a sky map with the appropriate structure and then fitting for the amplitude simultaneously with the other parameters .",
    "we investigated the possibility of non - linear drift by considering quadratic and cubic terms as well ; however , the results of  3.5 were insensitive to this refinement .",
    "the x - ray background has a diffuse ( or unresolved ) galactic component which varies strongly with galactic latitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "this emission is still significant at high galactic latitude ( @xmath45 ) and extrapolates to @xmath43 at the galactic poles .",
    "we modeled this emission in two ways .",
    "the first model consisted of a linear combination of a secant law galaxy with the haslam @xmath46 full sky map ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter was included to take into account x - rays generated by inverse compton scattering of cmb photons from high energy electrons in the galactic halo , the source of much of the synchtron emission in the haslam map .",
    "we find only marginal evidence for such emission (  3.5 ) . as an alternative galaxy model we also considered the two disk , exponentially truncated model of iwan et al .",
    "the analysis of  3.5 shows signficant x - ray emission corrlelated with either of these models .",
    "the level of emission from the plane of the lsc reported in this paper is barely above the noise ( @xmath47 )",
    ". therefore , detailed models of lsc emission are not particularly useful .",
    "we chose a simple `` pillbox '' model , i.e uniform x - ray emissivity , @xmath48 , within a circular disk of radius @xmath2 and height ( thickness ) , @xmath49 . the x - ray intensity in a particular direction is then proportional to the pathlength , @xmath50 , through the lsc disk , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the nominal location of the lsc disk was chosen to be in the supergalactic plane ( @xcite ) with a nominal center in the direction of the virgo cluster ( m87 ) ; however , these positions were allowed to vary from their fiducial locations .",
    "the radial position of the galaxy was assumed to be @xmath52 from the center of the lsc , i.e. , near the edge .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is left as a scale parameter in the final results ; however , the dependence on the diameter of the lsc was investigated by varying the radial position of the galaxy within the lsc disk ( see  4.5 ) .",
    "the thickness to diameter ratio , @xmath53 , was also varied ; however , we considered the nominal value to be @xmath54 which is consistent with the distribution of galaxies in the lsc ( @xcite ) . in any case , as is true for the galaxy model , the results of  3.5 are not overly sensitive to these model parameters .",
    "combining the three above models with a uniform x - ray background we arrive at the following 5 parameter expression for the `` diffuse '' x - ray intensity , @xmath55 , in the @xmath56 sky pixel , @xmath57 where the first term represents the intensity of the uniform x - ray background , @xmath58 represents the intensity due to the lsc `` pillbox '' normalized to a pathlength of @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the pattern on the sky caused by a linear drift in detector sensitivity , @xmath61 is emission proportional to the cosecant of galactic latitude normalized to the galactic pole , @xmath62 is the antenna temperature ( in @xmath63 ) of the @xmath64 haslam map , and @xmath65 are the 5 free parameters . @xmath58 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62",
    "are convolved with the psf of the observed map .",
    "since , as discussed above , each pixel was weighted equally , the least squares fit to the 5 parameters is obtained by minimizing an effective @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the observed x - ray intensity in the @xmath56 pixel , @xmath69 is the @xmath56 pixel of the @xmath70 parameter map ( i.e. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) , and @xmath76 is the @xmath70 fit parameter .",
    "the sum , @xmath77 , is over all unflagged pixels in the cleaned heao map .",
    "the errors in the fit due to uncorrelated shot noise are easily computed by ( see for example press et al .",
    "1986 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 indicate the 5 fit parameters and @xmath80 indicates the photon shot noise in the @xmath56 pixel .",
    "@xmath81 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath82 which is defined as @xmath83 .",
    "the intrinsic fluctuations in the x - ray background ( xrb ) can be thought of as an additional source of noise .",
    "the errors in the fit parameters induced by this noise are more problematic since xrb fluctuations exhibit pixel to pixel correlations due to the finite psf of the detectors and the clustering of x - ray sources . in addition",
    ", these fluctuations may not be uniform on the sky .",
    "if @xmath84 represents the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of the intensity of the xrb then it is straightforward to show that the corresponding errors in the fit parameters are given by @xmath85    as an estimate of these errors we will , in the analysis to follow , assume that the fluctuations are uniform .",
    "figure 2 is the acf of the x - ray map ( map@xmath86 - see  3.5 ) corrected for large - scale structure ( i.e. , a uniform x - ray background , the compton - getting dipole , galaxy and lsc emission , and instrumental drift ) .",
    "the point at @xmath87 has been corrected for photon shot noise . if correlated structure on small angular scales is entirely due to a gaussian psf ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath88 , it is straightforward to show that the acf has the form , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the angle between the @xmath56 and the @xmath91 pixels .",
    "the dashed curve in figure 2 is this functional form .",
    "note that @xmath92 is not a fit parameter but is determined by the profiles of point sources ( see  2 ) .",
    "while this curve is a good fit to the data for @xmath93 , the data for @xmath94 lie somewhat above the curve . whether or not this is due to clustering of the x - ray background or to an improperly modeled psf",
    "is not clear ; however , it seems unlikely that the psf extends out to @xmath29 . in any case",
    ", we have also modelled the acf as the sum of an exponential and a term proportional to @xmath95 to account for the possibility of large - scale clustering .",
    "the solid curve in figure 2 represents this four parameter fit .",
    "since the photon shot noise and sky fluctuations are uncorrelated , the two sources of errors should be added in quadrature , i.e. , @xmath96 .      the results of the analysis described in  3.4 for two different cleaning windows of the map are given in table 1 .",
    "map@xmath97 is minimally windowed , i.e. the galaxy pixels are flagged as well as the regions around the piccinotti sources ( see  2 ) .",
    "in addition , 20 `` sources '' , i.e. , isolated regions of high flux , were flagged ( see  2 ) ; however , these comprised only 0.21 sr , i.e. 1.6% of full sky .",
    "this cleaned map contains 11637 pixels which corresponds to a 47% sky coverage .",
    "map@xmath86 was subjected to more aggressive `` source '' cleaning and contains 8153 pixels , i.e. 33% sky coverage .",
    "the three errors listed in table 1 are for photon shot noise only and for shot noise plus the estimated noise for fluctuations in the xrb according to the two models of figure 2 ( see  3.4 ) . for shot noise alone",
    ", @xmath98 is quite large which is simply an indication of the importance of fluctuations in the xrb .",
    "when these fluctuations are included @xmath98 drops considerably . the fact that in the latter case @xmath99 is not particularly signficant since fluctuations in the xrb were esimated from excess noise in the map .",
    "the effective number of degrees of freedom is considerably less ( by about a factor of 10 ) than the number of pixels since the largest component of the noise is correlated .",
    "it is clear from table 1 that the parameters from the two fits are consistent with each other and indicate ( with the possible expection of @xmath100 ) that all parameters are significantly different from zero . from table 2",
    "we see that fit parameters are not strongly correlated with each other . of particular significance to this paper",
    "is that the flux associated with the supercluster is positive by @xmath101 even when the fluctuations in the xrb are taken into account .",
    "a test for the statistical significance for this result is discussed in  4.4 .",
    "taken at face value , the fits in table 1 indicate that diffuse x - ray emission from the local supercluster has been detected .",
    "however , a great many checks must be made on robustness of this result : e.g. , whether or not the signal comes from a few strong point sources located near the supergalactic plane ; whether or not the signal is due x - ray emitting galaxies distributed in the lsc ; whether or not the signal arises from a chance allignment of fluctuations in the x - ray background ; whether or not the result is sensitive to the pillbox model parameters ; etc .",
    "the next section contains a detailed discussion of these issues .",
    ".fit parameters for maps@xmath97 and @xmath86 .",
    "the units are @xmath102 .",
    "the parameter @xmath103 corresponds to the intensity of the xrb , @xmath104 is emission from the lsc , @xmath105 is detector drift , @xmath106 is galactic secant law emission , and @xmath100 is emission proportional to the haslam map ( in units of @xmath107 ) .",
    "@xmath108 is the error in the fit for photon counting noise only , @xmath109 includes fluctuations in the xrb modeled as the dashed curve in figure 2 , and @xmath110 includes fluctuations modeled as the solid curve of figure 2 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,^,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "even though the plane of the galaxy , a strong source of x - ray emission , was removed from the map ( see  2 ) , high galactic latitude emission is large enough to be a potential source of error .",
    "however , the planes of the galaxy and the lsc are nearly perpendicular and the center of the lsc is nearly at the galactic pole .",
    "it is these fortuitous circumstances that result in nearly uncorrelated galaxy and lsc fit parameters ( see table 2 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects that the fit to lsc emission will be nearly independent of galactic emission . as an alternative galaxy model we considered the two disk , exponentially truncated model of iwan et al .",
    "the @xmath66 for the fits with this model were slightly worse while the lsc fit parameters were essentially unchanged ( @xmath111 ) . even if the galaxy model is left out of the fit entirely , the resulting lsc emission changes by only @xmath112 ; however , the @xmath66 is signficantly worse",
    ". therefore , we consider it unlikely that the supercluster emission found above is due to galaxy contamination .",
    "as discussed in  2 , the x - ray map was corrected for the earth s motion relative to the average rest frame of the distant universe as defined by the cmb dipole .",
    "this is justified since the bulk of the x - ray background arises from sources at high redshift ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the x - ray dipole is easily computed from the cmb dipole and the spectrum of the x - ray background , i.e. , @xmath114 which is @xmath115 times larger than the cmb dipole .",
    "in addition , it is likely that x - rays trace the asymmetric mass distribution which created our peculiar velocity , and one would expect an intrinsic dipole moment in the xrb which is more or less alligned with the compton - getting dipole .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that the former will be as large as the latter . from unified models of the xrb ( e.g. @xcite ) , less than @xmath116 of the xrb background arises from sources within @xmath117 and with fluxes @xmath118 .",
    "lahav , piran , and treyer ( 1997 ) demonstrated that the large - scale structure dipole can be comparable to the compton - getting dipole if one assumes , contrary to observations , unevolving x - ray luminosity and no upper limit on source flux .",
    "it is unlikely that their calculation is relevant to our analysis ; never - the - less , we considered the possibility that the dipole correction made to the data is in error .",
    "if a dipole term is included in the fit , it is also not strongly correlated with the `` pillbox '' term and the resulting lsc emission changes by only @xmath119 for map@xmath97 and by @xmath120 for map@xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath66 s were only marginally better if these terms are included .",
    "it is interesting that the resulting fit dipoles for the two maps agree within errors with that predicted for the compton - getting dipole . for map@xmath86 ,",
    "the fit dipole amplitude is @xmath121 while the direction is @xmath122 from the cmb dipole which is well within the directional error .",
    "for map@xmath97 these values are @xmath123 and @xmath124 also consistent with the compton - getting dipole .",
    "we find the results of the dipole fits signficant in that they indicate that large - scale structure can be detected at this level . if the dipole term is excluded altogether from the fit , the values of lsc emission for the two maps increase by about @xmath125 .",
    "the timedrift fit parameter in table 1 corresponds to somewhat less than @xmath126 of the xrb during the six month interval of the observations and , therefore , is also of potential concern .",
    "however , from table 2 it is evident that the this fit parameter is essentially uncorrelated with the lsc parameter indicating that our estimate of lsc emission is also not very sensitive to drift of detector sensitivity . in the case",
    "that the linear timedrift model is removed from the fit , the lsc parameter changes by @xmath127 while the @xmath66 s are significantly worse . in order to test the limitations of the linear timedrift model we included cubic and quadratic terms as well . the solutions and",
    "@xmath66 s were essentially unchanged .",
    "we conclude that detector drift can not account for the observed emission from the lsc .    the galaxy , the dipole , and the effects of timedrift are all more or less orthogonal to the lsc . in fact , if we remove all three of these items from the analysis the fit to lsc emission changes by only @xmath128 for map@xmath86 and by @xmath129 for map@xmath97 .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the x - ray background is composed of discrete sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "source confusion due to the finite resolution of the map along with inherent clustering of sources result in fluctuations in the xrb with an angular scale of about @xmath130 and an amplitude of about @xmath131 of the background . on the other hand",
    ", the implied lsc emission is about @xmath132 of the xrb so it is important to consider whether or not chance allignments of these fluctuation could account for it .    to the extent that fluctuations in the xrb can be modelled as in  3.5",
    ", the above analysis indicates that the fit to lsc emission is signficant at the @xmath133 level . as an independent check we repeated the fits for 5000 pillbox models with a uniform distibution of orientations in the sky .",
    "because of the extensive windowing of the galactic plane , models lying within @xmath28 of the galactic plane were disregarded . also because of the `` detected '' lsc emission , models lying within @xmath28 of the lsc plane were also excluded . for map@xmath97 ,",
    "the amplitude of lsc emission in table 1 exceeds those of @xmath134 of the trials while @xmath135 of the @xmath66s of the trial fits exceed the value in the table .",
    "only @xmath136 of the trials have lsc emission greater and @xmath66s less than those listed in table 1 .",
    "the results for map@xmath86 are even stronger .",
    "the lsc emission exceeds the fits of @xmath5 of the trials while the @xmath66 is exceeded by @xmath134 of the @xmath66s of the trials .",
    "only @xmath137 of the trials have lsc emission greater and @xmath66s less that the values listed in table 1 .",
    "if one includes the models that lie within @xmath28 of the plane of the lsc , the results for map@xmath86 are essentially the same while for map@xmath97 @xmath138 of the trials have lsc emission greater and @xmath66s less that those listed in table 1 . since map@xmath97 has significantly more `` hot spots '' than the more heavily windowed map@xmath86 , it is perhaps not surprising that the former is more susceptible to chance allignments of these `` sources '' resulting in spuriously large amplitudes of emission accociated with several pillbox models .",
    "we conclude that at the @xmath139 confidence level fluctuations in the xrb are not responsible for the observed signal .",
    "this corresonds to a @xmath140 to @xmath141 effect and is roughly consistent with the estimates of the errors indicated in table 1 .",
    "the pillbox model for the lsc is highly simplistic ; however , more refined models seem umwarranted considering the relatively low signal to noise ( @xmath142 ) indicated in table 1 .",
    "never - the - less , several important checks of the model can be made .",
    "the checks illustrated in the figures below are for the more extensively windowed map@xmath86 ; however , the conclusions are essentially the same for both maps .",
    "figure 3 is a plot of the lsc emission fit for a series of pillbox models lying in the supergalactic plane but with centers rotated by angles in steps of @xmath28 from the nominal center of the lsc in virgo .",
    "it is clear that the largest emission signals occur when the model center is near the nominal direction .",
    "in addition , the @xmath66s of the fits are signficantly worse for models rotated by angles @xmath143 .",
    "the lowest @xmath66 occurs ( for both windowed maps ) at an angle of @xmath144 for which the lsc emission is somewhat larger ; however , the differences from the virgo centered model are not significant .",
    "the dependence of the results on the vertical position of the galaxy within the disk of the lsc is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the vertical position is expressed in terms of the disk thickness , @xmath49 , so @xmath145 represents the top and bottom of the disk .",
    "again the nominal central position yields the largest lsc emission with the @xmath66s of the fits increasing signficantly at the extremes .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the dependence of results on the radial position of the galaxy in the lsc .",
    "position is expressed in units of the supercluster radius .",
    "the nominal value is @xmath146 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the largest lsc emission is found for models with the galaxy near the edge of the lsc ( note : negative values indicate models with centers in the direction opposite virgo ) .",
    "the model with the nominal radial position has the smallest value of @xmath66 while models with radial positions @xmath147 have significantly larger @xmath66s . for this test",
    "the results for map@xmath97 differ somewhat in that models with radial positions @xmath148 have reasonable @xmath66s ; however , the fit lsc emission was comparable for all these models .    in order to test specifically whether or not a few isolated `` hot spots '' in the supergalactic plane are responsible for the signal , the data is binned according to that emission predicted from the pillbox model and then plotted in figure 6 as a function of emission predicted from the model .",
    "the scale of the predicted emission is taken from table 1 and the data is corrected for all fit large - scale structure except for lsc emission .",
    "if the signal is due to hot spots in the direction of the center of the lsc , the extreme right hand data point would fall well above the unity slope curve while other points would fall well below the curve . within the limitations of signal to noise",
    ", it appears that this is not the case .",
    "of course , the disposition of the data is sensitive to the binning .",
    "while finer scale binning does show a great deal of scatter , the linear trend is clear .",
    "the data from map@xmath97 shows the same trend with a bit more scatter .",
    "finally we investigate how sensitive the results are to varying the thickness to diameter ratio of the pillbox model .",
    "the answer is `` not very '' . for map@xmath97 , only for ratios @xmath149 less than @xmath150 and greater than @xmath151 are the @xmath66s of the fits signficantly worse . for map@xmath86 these values",
    "are @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the values of lsc emission decrease somewhat as @xmath149 increases ; however , the statistical signficance of detection is roughly the same for all models in this range .",
    "one can only deduce a very rough value of the thickness to diameter ratio from the data and must rely on the optical structure of the lsc ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the more important aspect of the models is that the emission is enhanced in the general direction of virgo .      as discussed in  2 pixels of the x - ray map",
    "were flagged if they were : 1 ) too close to the plane of the galaxy ; 2 ) if they were near a strong x - ray source ; or 3 ) if they were near a positive fluctuation in the xrb . failing to remove the strong x - ray sources results in a very poor fit , @xmath154",
    "; therefore , these cuts are absolutely necessary . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of  3.5 are relatively insensitive to the other two cuts .",
    "the level of lcs emission changes by less than @xmath125 if the galactic plane cut is varied between @xmath27 and @xmath155 ( the smallest fit value of lsc emission is only @xmath156 less than that of table 1 ) .",
    "similarly , the fit lsc emission does not change significantly from the minimally windowed map@xmath97 to a map with only @xmath129 full sky coverage .      as a check on how well the modelled structure matches the x - ray sky ,",
    "the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of the map was compared with that predicted by the model .",
    "one might expect that the unity values of the @xmath66 s of table 1 indicate that the fit is quite good . however , recall that this value was forced by assuming that all the excess variance was due to fluctuations in the xrb .",
    "if , on the other hand , the excess were due to unmodelled large - scale structure then the modelled acf would not fit the data .",
    "figure 7 shows that the acf is well modelled and that there appears to be little other large - scale structure in the map .",
    "the solid curve of figure 2 was taken as the model of the small - scale fluctuations in the xrb .",
    "for @xmath157 the data is binned in @xmath158 bins to reduce scatter .",
    "even if the above arguments indicate that there is x - ray emission associated with the plane of the lsc , it is not at all clear that this emission originates from diffuse gas . after all , there are a great many galaxies and several clusters in this plane and all of these emit x - rays at some level .",
    "however , there are several indications that it is not the case that faint sources contribute significantly to the x - ray emission in the lsc plane . at a distance of @xmath159",
    "the cutoff flux of the present map ( @xmath160 ) corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath161 ; therefore , only relatively weak ( compared to agn ) sources could contribute .",
    "the observed upper limit of the average @xmath0 emissivity of such sources in the local ( @xmath162 ) universe is @xmath163 ( @xcite ) where @xmath164 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath165 . on the other hand the pillbox model of the lsc and the amplitude of the x - ray flux in table 1",
    "imply an average x - ray emissivity of @xmath166 ( see  6 ) .",
    "thus for a hubble constant of @xmath167 the ratio of the observed lsc emissivity to the average emissivity of weak sources is @xmath168 . for an lsc collapse factor",
    "is @xmath169 , the observed emissivity could be due to weak sources without seriously violating this constraint .",
    "however , unified models of the xrb indicate that it is unlikely that weak sources make a signficant contribution to the average x - ray emissivity .",
    "for example , the model of comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) imply an average , local @xmath0 emissivity of @xmath170 which is consistent with the observed value ( @xmath171 ) derived by miyaji et al .",
    "( 1994 ) from a cross - correlation analysis of the heao-1 a2 map with galaxies from the iras survey .",
    "the comastri model ( by design ) accounts for the entire xrb .",
    "according to this model , weak sources make a small contribution to the local emissivity , i.e. @xmath172 . for @xmath173 this is a factor of @xmath174 less than inferred for the lsc .",
    "if weak sources account for the lsc emissivity , then either comastri et al . (",
    "1995 ) seriously underestimate their numbers or the lsc collapse factor is much larger than observed for visible galaxies . while the above argument is suggestive , it is based on a unfied agn model which is by no means certain .",
    "in fact , there is some spectulation that weak sources do make a significant contribution to the xrb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stronger constraints on the point source contribution to lsc emissivity come from the consideration of two source catalogs , the nearby galaxies catalog ( nbg ) ( @xcite ) and the rosat all - sky survey bright source catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are 2367 galaxies in the nbg catalog which consists of all galaxies with known velocities @xmath175 .",
    "this catalog is dominated by two data sets : the shapely - ampes sample and the all - sky survey of neutral hydrogen .",
    "although the catalog has severe incompleteness problems at velocities above @xmath176 the coverage is homogeneous across the unobscured part of the sky ( @xcite ) . in any case , if point x - ray sources associated with galaxies in the lsc are an important source of x - ray emissivity it seems reasonable that much of the emission would be associated with the galaxies in this catalog . to check this possibility , the x - ray map was further cleaned by removing @xmath177 square degree regions ( somewhat larger than the psf of the map ) at the location of all of catalog galaxies .",
    "many of these regions lie in already windowed sections of the map . after the additional cuts",
    "the sky coverage was reduced to @xmath178 for map@xmath97 and @xmath179 for map@xmath86 .",
    "the reduced coverage results in an increase in noise ; however , the levels of lsc emission are still marginally significant ( @xmath180 and @xmath181 for map@xmath97 and map@xmath86 respectively ) and are somewhat larger than but consistent with the values in table 1 .",
    "another check of the level of contribution of galaxies from the nbg catalog was made by fitting the lsc pillbox plus a monopole to the @xmath182 regions surrounding the galaxies but with the appropriate windowing of maps@xmath97 and @xmath86 . before the fits",
    "the maps were corrected for a dipole , the galaxy and instrumental drift .",
    "the sky coverage for these fits was only @xmath183 and @xmath184 ; however , if these regions dominate lsc emission then the amplitude of the fit should be considerably larger than in table 1 .",
    "this was not the case .",
    "in fact , the fit amplitudes of lsc emission are essentially the same as those in table 1 .",
    "although the above tests are consistent with diffuse lsc emission , the tully galaxies ( smoothed by the psf ) occupy a great deal of the lsc plane and so this conclusion must be tempered .",
    "one final check on the galaxy contribution was to generate a map by assigning an x - ray flux to each galaxy , convolve the resulting map with the psf , and then apply the windowing appropriate for maps@xmath97 and @xmath86 .",
    "the x - ray flux of the galaxies was obtained by cross - correlating the x - ray map with an appropriately smoothed map of galaxy number density .",
    "this was done in four different distance bins ( @xmath185 and @xmath186 ) in order to account for distance dependence of flux . only for",
    "the first bin was the correlation statistically significant .",
    "the x - ray emission from galaxies was determined using the @xmath187 upper limits of the cross - correlation for the appropriate distance bin . the linear regression applied to the resulting maps yields upper limits to lsc emission which are a factor of 3 below the levels of table 1 .",
    "this result is another indication that x - ray emission from galaxies is not the major component of x - ray emission from the lsc plane .",
    "a more direct indication of the contribution of point sources is the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) bright source catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are 18,811 sources in this catalog down to a @xmath188 flux limit of @xmath189 ( @xmath190 for a photon spectral index of @xmath191 where @xmath192 ) . at a brightness limit of @xmath193 ( 8,547 sources )",
    "the catalogue represents a sky coverage of 92% .",
    "two hardness ratios , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , are defined by @xmath196 and @xmath197 where @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 are the count rates in passbands that correspond roughly to @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average @xmath195 hardness ratio of the sources corresponds to a photon spectral index of @xmath206 ; although , there are certainly sources that are much harder as well as sources that are much softer than this spectrum . for @xmath191 , the catalog limit corresponds to a @xmath0 flux of @xmath207 which is about two orders of magnitude below the piccinotti et al .",
    "( 1982 ) sources ( see  2 ) .",
    "if there is a signficant population of relatively faint ( @xmath208 to @xmath209 ) sources in the lsc , then a large fraction of these should show up in the bright source survey .",
    "even though the completeness level is not entirely uniform , the catalog can still be used to give an indication of the level contamination by point sources .",
    "there are too many rass sources to simply window them from the heao map ( @xmath130 cuts around each source would window the entire map ) ; however , there are several ways of testing for the effects of rass point sources .    to check the contamination due to relatively bright sources or clusters of sources we constructed a b - band ( @xmath203 ) map of rass sources convolved with the heao psf .",
    "if the resulting b - band flux in any pixel was greater than @xmath210 ( for @xmath211 this corresponds to a flux of @xmath212 ) then a @xmath182 region about the pixel was windowed from the two previously windowed heao maps , i.e. , maps@xmath97 and @xmath86 .",
    "note that a single source with a flux of @xmath213 is at the cutoff flux after smoothing with the psf .",
    "the resulting heavily windowed maps , map@xmath214 and map@xmath215 , had sky coverages of @xmath216 and @xmath217 respectively . when the linear regression of  3.4 was performed on these two maps the fits to lsc emission",
    "were somewhat larger but not significantly different than the fits of table 1 .",
    "the errors in the fits were about @xmath218 larger due to the reduced sky coverage .",
    "similar results were obtained when the rass cutoff flux level was varied as well as for windowing individual sources ( i.e. not convolved with the psf ) with b - band fluxes above a cutoff level .",
    "these results indicate that the lsc emission indicated in table 1 is not due to the brighter of the rass sources .    as another check on contaimination , every source in the rass catalog",
    "was assigned a @xmath0 flux from its b - band flux by assuming a spectral index of @xmath219 which was deduced from @xmath195 hardness ratio .",
    "for faint sources the quantity hr2 is quite noisy and the computed value of @xmath220 might be either larger than -1 or smaller than -3 . for these sources @xmath220 was simply forced to be -1 or -3 which we consider to the limits of the range for nearly all x - ray sources .",
    "the b - band fluxes were corrected for galactic extinction using hi column density maps ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the absorption coefficients of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "these corrections made little difference and , in any case , are probably less important than internal extinction in the sources themselves .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 flux map was then convolved with the heao psf and subtracted from the heao maps , map@xmath97 and map@xmath86 .",
    "the linear regressions applied to these corrected maps implied lsc emission somewhat larger than but not significantly different from the values in table 1 .    as an upper limit to the contamination by rass sources we applied the above map correction assuming that every source has a very hard spectrum , i.e. @xmath221 .",
    "the linear regression fit to map@xmath86 was essentially unchanged while the lsc emission fit to map@xmath97 was reduced by about @xmath222 . assuming every source has the average spectral index , i.e. @xmath191 , yields results that are virtually indistinguishable from those of table 1 .    at the catalog limit",

    "the effects of non - uniform coverage and imperfect knowledge of the spectra of individual sources , the above source corrections to the @xmath0 flux are not particularly accurate . on the other hand",
    ", they do indicate that the emissivity of weak x - ray sources in the lsc is about an order of magnitude less that those implied in table 1 and we conclude that those results are not contaminated by point sources .",

    "even if this flux is increased by the collapse factor of 10 , it is still considerably less than that inferred for the lsc ( see  6 ) .    as a further check on possible contamination by extended emission from galaxy clusters we extended the windowing of the x - ray map to include @xmath233 diameter regions around the virgo , centarus , coma , fornax , and ursa major clusters as well as around the most dense regions of the hydra , pavo , perseus , and ophiuchus galaxy clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally the diffuse emission found by jahoda & mushozky ( 1989 ) was eliminated by windowing a @xmath234 diameter region about the great attractor .",
    "fits of the lsc emission to these further windowed maps were only @xmath119 less that those of table 1 while the errors in the fit were , of course , somewhat larger .",
    "therefore , there is no indication that the fits of table 1 are contaminated by either the cores of clusters of galaxies or by diffuse emission from the great attractor .",
    "the windowing of more extensive regions of galaxy clouds in the lsc would not be possible without cutting most of the plane of the lsc and , in any case , it is not clear one should distinguish such emission with diffuse emission in the lsc .",
    "this point is essentially the same as asking whether or not lsc emission is smooth or somewhat clumpy and will be addressed in  6 below ; however , the bottom line is that the signal to noise is simply not high enough to be able to give a clear answer .",
    "if the diffuse x - ray emission in the lsc is due to bremsstrahlung from a hot , ionized intergalactic medium then one might expect its signature to be imprinted upon the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) via inverse compton scattering , i.e. the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( @xcite ) .",

    "the limit on @xmath290 from the cobe data is ( @xcite ) @xmath299 which implies that @xmath300 . if @xmath301 as inferred from the local density of scs , then the presence of hot gas in these scs is consistent with the upper limit to the spectral distortion of the cmb .",
    "evidence is presented in this paper for x - ray emission associated with the plane of the local supercluster ( lsc ) . while this has been suggested previously ( @xcite ) , we argue that the emission is unlikely to be produced by individual sources but rather is diffuse in nature .",
    "this implies that there is a great deal of hot ( @xmath302 ) , diffuse ( @xmath303 ) gas in the lsc and that the gas may account for the bulk of baryonic matter in the local universe .",
    "the presence of such gas would be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as a sunyaev - zeldovich temperature decrement of @xmath304 . while the cobe 53 ghz map is consistent with such structure , other systematics preclude the positive identification of this component .",
    "even if superclusters are relatively plentiful in the universe and hot gas in them is common , the resulting fluctuations in the cmb would be small relative to the those found in the cobe data and , therefore , unlikely to compromise the cosmological implications of those fluctuations .",
    "it should be emphasized that the existence of hot , diffuse gas in the lsc is by no means firmly established .",
    "the results presented here constitute only a @xmath3 to @xmath305 effect and @xmath305 results have a history of disappearing . also the source of the x - ray emission may not be diffuse , hot gas ; although , we argue that point sources probably do not account for it . none - the - less , the results are tantalizing and are consistent with the density and temperature of gas that might be expected to inhabit the intergalactic medium .",
    "it is unlikely that more detailed analyses of the heao and cobe data will shed more light on the situation .",
    "the signals to noise of these maps are simply not good enough",
    ". however , the next generation of x - ray satellites with higher angular resolution , better frequency resolution , and higher sensitivities will likely be able to either confirm or refute the suggestions made in this paper as well as be able to detect diffuse emission in other relatively nearby superclusters .",
    "finally the new cmb satellites scheduled for launch in the next few years ( i.e. map and planck ) should have the angular and frequency resolution required to distinguish an sz effect in the lsc from intrinsic cmb fluctuations if the level of the effect is that suggested by this paper .",

    "<S> the heao1 a2 full sky , @xmath0 x - ray map was searched for emission correlated with the plane of the local supercluster of galaxies . after removing strong point and moderately extended sources ( e.g. the core of the virgo cluster ) , there remained a statistically signficant component of `` diffuse '' x - rays in the plane of the supercluster . fitting </S>",
    "<S> this diffuse component with a simple `` pillbox '' model of the local supercluster implies a volume x - ray emissivity of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius of the supercluster and the error is photon counting noise only . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers fluctuations in the x - ray background as an additional component of noise then the significance of the detection is reduced to @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with fits of the model to data sets obtained by rotating the original data . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of these rotated fits indicates that the detection is signficant at the @xmath5 confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> if the source of the x - ray emission is bremsstrahlung from a uniformly distributed plasma with temperature @xmath6 then the implied electron number density is @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> a search for similar structure in the cobe @xmath9 microwave background map yielded a marginal detection with an amplitude of @xmath10 ( statistical error only ) which is consistent with the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect expected from @xmath11 gas . </S>",
    "<S> this latter value is comparable to the amplitude of intrinsic large - scale fluctuations in the microwave background and should be considered to be a @xmath12 result at best . </S>"
