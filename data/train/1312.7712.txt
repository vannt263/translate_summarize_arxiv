    "through remarkable developments in solid earth science since the late 1960s , our understanding of earthquakes has increased significantly .",
    "the availability of relevant data has steadily increased as the study of earthquakes has progressed remarkably in geophysics .",
    "after every major earthquake , researchers have elucidated important seismic mechanisms associated with it . however , even though detailed analysis and discussions have been conducted , large uncertainties remain because of diversity and complexity of the earthquake phenomenon .",
    "this leads to unachievable challenges in deterministic earthquake prediction because all diverse and complex scenarios must faithfully reflect the processes of earthquakes to be considered for effective earthquake prediction .    on the other hand ,",
    "several techniques for predicting earthquakes have been proposed on the basis of anomalies of various types ; however , the effectiveness of these techniques is controversial ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , objectivity is required for such evaluation ; otherwise , arguments presented may lack merit .",
    "new prediction models that claim to incorporate potentially useful information over those used in standard seismicity models should be evaluated to determine whether predictive power is improved .",
    "earthquake forecasting models should evolve in this manner .",
    "recently , there has been growing momentum for seismologists to develop an organized research program on earthquake predictability . an international cooperative study known as _",
    "collaboratory for the study of earthquake predictability _",
    "( csep ; http://www.cseptesting.org/ ) is currently under way among countries prone to major earthquakes for exploring possibilities in earthquake prediction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an immediate objective of the project is to encourage the development of statistical models of seismicity , such as those subsequently discussed in section  [ sec2 ] , and to evaluate their predictive performances in terms of probability .",
    "in addition , the csep study aims to develop a scientific infrastructure to evaluate statistical significance and _ probability _ _ gain _ ( @xcite ) of various methods used to predict large earthquakes by using observed abnormalities such as seismicity anomaly , transient crustal movements and electromagnetic anomaly . here _",
    "probability gain _ is defined as the ratio of probability of a large earthquake estimated based on an anomaly to the underlying probability without anomaly .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] describes this important concept , and then discusses statistical point - process models to examine the significance of causality of anomalies and also to evaluate the probability gains conditional on the anomalous events .    for prediction of large earthquakes with a higher probability gain ,",
    "comprehensive studies of anomalous phenomena and observations of earthquake mechanisms are essential .",
    "several such studies are summarized in sections  [ sec4][sec6 ] .",
    "particularly , i  have been interested in elucidating abnormal seismic activities and geodetic anomalies to apply them for promoting forecasting abilities , as described in these sections .",
    "through repeated revisions , csep attempts to establish standard models to predict probability that conform to various parts of the world . here",
    "i mean the prediction / estimation of probability as predicting / estimating conditional probabilities given the past history of earthquakes and other possible precursors .",
    "the likelihood is used as a reasonable measure of prediction performance ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the evaluation method for probabilistic forecasts of earthquakes by the log - likelihood function has been proposed , discussed and implemented ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ogata , utsu and katsura , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; zechar , gerstenberger and rhoades , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some such studies ,",
    "the evaluation score has been referred to as ( relative ) entropy , which is essentially similar to the log - likelihood .",
    "baseline models should be set to compare with and evaluate all predictability models .",
    "based on empirical laws , we can predict standard reference probability of earthquakes in a space  time - magnitude range on the basis of the time series of present and past earthquakes .",
    "the framework of csep , which has evaluated performances of submitted forecasts of respective regions ( @xcite ; zechar , gerstenberger and rhoades , @xcite ; @xcite ) , is similar to that of the california regional earthquake likelihood models ( relm ) project for spatial forecast ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "different space ",
    "time models were submitted to the csep japan testing center at the earthquake research institute , university of tokyo , for the one - day forecast applied to the testing region in japan ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the model forecasts the probability of an earthquake at each space  time - magnitude bin .",
    "however , the csep protocols have to be improved to those in terms of point - processes on a continuous time axis for the evaluation including a real - time forecast ( @xcite ) .    almost all models incorporated the gutenberg  richter ( g  r ) law for forecasting the magnitude factor , and take different variants of the space  time epidemic - type aftershock sequence ( etas ) model ( @xcite , and @xcite ) . in the following sections",
    ", i will outline these models .",
    "gutenberg and richter ( @xcite ) determined that the number of earthquakes increased ( decreased ) exponentially as their magnitude decreased ( increased ) . describing this theory in terms of point processes ,",
    "the intensity of magnitude @xmath0 is @xmath1 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & 10^{a - bm}=ae^{-\\beta m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", the magnitude of each earthquake will obey an exponential distribution such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a cutoff magnitude value above which all earthquakes are detected .",
    "traditionally , the @xmath3-value had been estimated graphically , however , more efficient estimation is performed by the maximum likelihood method . @xcite",
    "derived it by the moment method .",
    "later , @xcite demonstrated that this is a maximum - likelihood estimate ( mle ) and provided the error estimate .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitudes in most catalogs are given in the interval of 0.1 ( discrete magnitude values ) , hence , care should be taken for avoiding the bias of the @xmath3 estimate in likelihood - based estimation procedures ( @xcite ) .    although the coefficient @xmath3 in a wide region is generally slightly smaller than 1.0 , @xcite further determined that the @xmath3-value varies according to location in smaller seismic regions .",
    "the varies even within japan and further varies with time .",
    "temporal and spatial changes have attracted the attention of many researchers ever since @xcite reported a difference between @xmath3-values of foreshocks and aftershocks in a sequence .    here , we consider that @xmath7 can vary with time , space and space  time according to a function such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "various nonparametric smoothing algorithms such as kernel methods have been proposed ( wiemer and wyss , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath7 value can be parameterized by smooth cubic splines ( ogata , imoto and katsura , @xcite ; @xcite ) or piece - wise linear expansions on delaunay tessellated space  ( @xcite ; see also figure  [ f01 ] , e.g. ) .",
    "in such a case , a penalized log - likelihood ( @xcite ) is used whereby the log - likelihood function is associated with penalty functions in which the coefficients are constrained for smoothness of the @xmath7 function . for the optimal estimation of the @xmath7 function ,",
    "the weights in the penalty function are objectively adjusted in a bayesian framework , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "typical aftershock frequency decays according to the reverse power function with time ( @xcite ; utsu , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first , let @xmath11 be the number of aftershocks in an interval ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "then , the occurrence rate of aftershocks at the elapsed time @xmath13 since the main  shock is @xmath14 for constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is known as the omori ",
    "utsu ( o  u ) law .",
    "traditionally , estimates of the parameter @xmath16 have been obtained since the study of @xcite in the following manner .",
    "the numbers of aftershocks in a unit time interval @xmath17 are first plotted against elapsed time on doubly logarithmic axes , and then are fit to an asymptotic straight line .",
    "the slope of this line is an estimate for @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath18 can be determined by measuring the bending curve immediately after the main shock .",
    "such an analysis is based on the time series of counted numbers of aftershocks . by such a plot",
    ", we can find aftershock sequences for which the formula ( [ eq2 ] ) lasts a long period , more than 120 years , for example ( @xcite ; @xcite ; utsu , ogata and matsuura , @xcite ) .    to efficiently estimate the three parameters directly on the basis of occurrence time records of aftershocks , assuming nonstationary poisson process with intensity function ( [ eq2 ] )",
    ", @xcite suggested the maximum - likelihood method , which enabled the practical aftershock forecasting .",
    "@xcite proposed a procedure based on the joint intensity rate of time and magnitude of aftershocks ( @xcite ) according to the g ",
    "r law  ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath19 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & \\frac{10^{a + b(m_{0 } - m)}}{(t + c)^{p}}\\quad ( a , b , c , p;\\ \\mathrm{constant}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the magnitude of an aftershock and @xmath13 is the time following a main shock of magnitude @xmath20 ; the parameters are independently estimated by the maximum - likelihood method for respective empirical laws .",
    "after a large earthquake occurs , the japan meteorological agency ( jma ) and the united states geological survey ( usgs ) have undertaken operational probability forecast of the aftershocks .",
    "however , the forecast is announced after the elapse of 24  h or more .",
    "this is due to the deficiency of aftershock data due to overlapping of seismograms after the main shock . in particular ,",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is crucial for the early forecast , but difficult to estimate in an early period , whereas the other parameters can be default values for the early forecast [ @xcite ; earthquake research committee ( erc ) , @xcite ] .",
    "the difficulty is because the parameter @xmath2 can substantially differ even if the magnitudes of the main shocks are almost the same : for example , the numbers of the aftershocks of @xmath21 of two nearby main shocks of the same m6.8 differ by 67 times ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is notable that the strongest aftershocks occurred within 24  h in most sequences ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , despite adverse conditions during data collection , probabilistic aftershock forecasts should be delivered as soon as possible within 24  h after the main shock to mitigate secondary disasters in affected areas .    for this purpose ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate time - dependent missing rates , or detection rates , of aftershocks ( ogata and katsura , @xcite , @xcite ; ogata , @xcite ) because they enable probabilistic forecasting immediately after the main shock ( ogata , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detection rate of earthquakes is described by a probability function @xmath22 of magnitude @xmath0 such that @xmath23 .",
    "the intensity @xmath24 for actually observed magnitude frequency is described by @xmath25 , corresponding to thinning or random deletion .",
    "an example of the detection rate function is the cumulative of gaussian distribution or the so - called error function @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 represents the magnitude at which earthquakes are detected at a rate of 50% , and @xmath28 represents a range of magnitudes in which earthquakes are partially detected .",
    "let a data set of magnitudes @xmath29 be given at a period immediately after the main shock .",
    "assume that the parameters are time - dependent during the period such that @xmath30 with an improving detection rate @xmath31 .",
    "an additional parametric approach proposed by @xcite uses the state  space representation method for real - time forecasting within the 24  h period .",
    "the epidemic - type aftershock sequence(etas ) model describes earthquake activity as a point process ( @xcite , @xcite ) and includes the o  u law for aftershocks as a descendant process .",
    "this model assumes that the background seismicity is a stationary poisson process with a constant occurrence rate or number of earthquakes per day , @xmath27 .",
    "the conditional intensity function of the process is described by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the history of the occurrence times and magnitudes of earthquakes before time  @xmath13 , and @xmath20 is a reference magnitude throughout the data ; it can be a threshold magnitude in case of general seismic activity or a main shock magnitude in case of a single aftershock sequence .",
    "the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 are constants , and their detailed features are summarized and discussed in utsu , ogata and matsuura ( @xcite ) , for example . here , in simulations and forecasting , magnitude sequence is usually assumed to be independent and identically distributed according to the g ",
    "r law ( section  [ sec2.2.1 ] ) unless otherwise modeled like in @xcite .",
    "we estimate the etas parameters by using the maximum - likelihood estimation where the log - likelihood function , or rigorously partial log - likelihood ( @xcite ) , @xmath36 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } -\\int^{t}_{s}\\lambda_{\\theta}(t|h_{t})\\,dt\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is maximized with respect to the parameters @xmath37 . here , @xmath38 are data from the period [ @xmath39 consisting of occurrence times and magnitudes of earthquakes above a thereshold @xmath40 . here , note that the magnitudes are exogenous variables .",
    "the etas model is applied to data from the target time interval [ @xmath41 .",
    "the occurrence history @xmath42 during the precursor period [ @xmath43 is used for sustaining stationarity of the process after the time @xmath44 .",
    "then , the model s effectiveness in fitting an earthquake sequence can be evaluated by comparing the cumulative number @xmath45 of earthquakes with the rate predicted by the model @xmath46 in the time interval @xmath47 .",
    "if earthquakes in the catalog are described effectively by the etas model , the transformed time @xmath48 defined as @xmath49 , which include correction for the o  u law decay , will be distributed according to the stationary poisson process , and the plot of the actual cumulative number of events versus transformed time should be close to linear ( @xcite ) . the transformed time @xmath48 is useful for judging goodness of fit of the etas model because it assigns a visual check of the fit to a stationary poisson process .",
    "anomalous seismicity , not explained by the stationary etas model , will appear as systematic deviations from this trend .",
    "an example of such an analysis will be presented in section  [ sec4.3 ] and figure  [ f04 ] .",
    "to predict in real time , the probability ofoccurrence of future earthquakes using the dataof earthquakes in the past , the etas model has been used .",
    "for example , the etas model andits space  time extensions ( see section  [ sec2.2.4 ] ) are reviewed in the next version on operational earthquake forecast in california ( working groupon california earthquake probabilities , wgcep,@xcite ) .",
    "the space ",

    "are identified by fitting a bivariate normal distribution to spatial coordinates of the cluster occurring within a square of @xmath57  km side - length and within @xmath58 days after the large event of magnitude @xmath59 , according to @xcite ;",
    "but i use 1  h in prediction stage .",
    "the locations @xmath54 of all other events , including cluster members , remain the same as the epicenter coordinates of the original catalog ; and they are associated with the identity matrix for @xmath52 , namely , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "see figure  [ f02 ] for an illustrative view of the conditional intensity ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "further details of the algorithm can be found in studies of ogata ( @xcite ) .    ) of the space ",
    "time etas model ( ogata , @xcite ) to the jma hypocenter data of shallow earthquakes ( depth @xmath62  km ) of magnitude 5.0 or larger from the period 19261995 ; in addition , utsu s earthquake catalog for the 40 years period before 1926 ( 18851925 ) was used as the preceding occurrence history of the space  time etas model .",
    "space means longitude and latitude , whereas the depth data are neglected . ]",
    "although several alternative versions to the spatial factor given by the bracket of ( [ eq8 ] ) , as described by @xcite , are available , the form in ( [ eq8 ] ) fits best in terms of the akaike information criterion ( aic ; @xcite ) for japanese earthquake data sets .",
    "all extensions of the temporal etas model are referred to as space ",
    "time etas models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when a region becomes wide or the number of earthquakes becomes sufficiently large , spatial heterogeneity of seismicity becomes conspicuous .",
    "for example , many studies have been conducted on regional variation of seismicity - related parameters such as the @xmath3-value of the g ",
    "r law and @xmath16-values of the o  u law ( utsu , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "regarding space ",
    "time etas models , the aftershock productivity @xmath34 may differ significantly among locations , even if magnitudes of triggering earthquakes are similar ( see section  [ sec2.2.2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the main shock  aftershock and swarm - type clusters exhibit significantly different activity patterns .",
    "therefore , we applied an extension to the above space  time model to earthquakes in the entire region for developing a hierarchical space  time etas ( hist  etas ) model , which is a space  time etas model in which parameter values @xmath63 , @xmath35 , @xmath16 and @xmath64 can vary depending on location , such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "-values for background seismicity of the space time etas model ( [ eq8 ] ) in terms of minimum abic priors .",
    "the model is estimated from the jma data with earthquakes of m5.0 or larger for the target period 19261995 .",
    "in addition , utsu s earthquake catalog for the 40 years period before 1926 ( 18851925 ) was used as the precursory occurrence history of the space ",
    "time etas model .",
    "contours are equidistant in the logarithmic scale .",
    "stars indicate locations of earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or larger that occurred during 19962009 , which mostly occurred in high background rates .",
    "note however that there are several large earthquakes occurred at very low seismicity rates , the issue of which lead to section  [ sec2.3 ] . ]",
    "thus , coefficients of parameter functions of the space ",
    "time etas model in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) must be evaluated .",
    "coefficients of each parameter function are defined by values at epicenter locations of earthquakes and a number of points on the region boundary .",
    "hence , each function is uniquely defined by linear interpolation of values at three nearest points ( earthquakes ) determined by delaunay tessellation that is constructed by all the earthquake locations and additional points on the boundary of the region ( see figure  [ f01 ] ) .    for a stable optimal estimation , the freedom of coefficients of parameter functions needs to be constrained to assign penalties against roughness of the functions .",
    "the coefficients that maximize the penalized log - likelihood are then sought , which is the equivalent of attaining the maximum posterior distribution . here , we adjusted the optimal prior function for the parameter constraints in terms of the penalty function by an empirical bayesian method ( @xcite ) .",
    "further details can be found in the studies of @xcite and ogata ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ f03 ] shows the optimal solution of background seismic activities @xmath67 , which appear useful for long - term prediction of large earthquakes in and near japan .",
    "moreover , stochastic declustering using the space  time etas model can make realizations of background seismicity ( zhuang , ogata and vere - jones , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .      a characteristic earthquake is a repeating large earthquake that is traditionally defined from paleoseismology observations .",
    "the estimation is made by using recurrence times of a large earthquake on an active fault or a particular seismogenic region on a plate boundary .",
    "the earthquake research committee of japan ( erc , @xcite ) adopted the brownian passage time ( bpt ; matthews , ellsworth and reasenberg , @xcite ) renewal process , in which the inter - event probability density function is given by @xmath68 this equation considers the potential of further model extensions by useful physical concepts in the elastic rebound theory , such as stress interaction from neighboring earthquake ruptures .",
    "this physical concept will be subsequently described in sections  [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] .",
    "bpt renewal process is based on the following brownian perturbation process : @xmath69 which includes linearly increasing drift for stress accumulation and diffusion rate @xmath28 .",
    "an earthquake occurs when the path @xmath70 attains the critical stress level @xmath71 , and the accumulated stress is released down to the ground state @xmath72 based on elastic rebound theory of earthquakes ( @xcite ) .",
    "random fluctuations represent the transient stress changes due to the effect of other earthquakes in close proximity ( see section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "this model includes four parameters : the stress accumulation rate @xmath73 , perturbation rate @xmath28 , failure state @xmath71 , and ground state @xmath72 .",
    "if we assume that failure and ground states @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , are constant , the interval of earthquakes is independent and identically distributed with the bpt distribution , in which parameters are related by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "because of very small sample size available from each fault , the mean parameter @xmath27 has been estimated using methods other than the mle . the erc ( @xcite ) uses a common @xmath35 value of 0.24 throughout japan .",
    "this is because better fit of the same @xmath35 value was shown by the aic comparison than the different @xmath35 estimates for respective active faults , for a set of occurrence data with moderate sample sizes from four active faults ( erc , @xcite ) .",
    "also , the erc has estimated @xmath27 in two ways : as the mean of past recurrence intervals and as expected intervals estimated from the slip data of the fault plane .",
    "the latter estimate is expressed by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the slip size per earthquake and @xmath78 is the deformation rate per year , observed from the escarpment of the fault .",
    "the erc selects and applies one of these estimates for @xmath27 of each active fault according to reliability of the data .",
    "alternatively , @xcite propose following bayesian estimation procedure assuming a common prior distribution for fault segments throughout japan .",
    "consider historical occurrence data @xmath79 in the @xmath56th segment of @xmath80 fault segments .",
    "consider a posterior density @xmath81 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\quad = l(\\mu_{j } , \\alpha_{j}|\\mathbf{x}_{j } ) \\pi_{1 } ( \\mu_{j}|t_{j},\\phi_{\\mu } ) \\pi_{2 } ( \\alpha_{j}|\\phi_{\\alpha } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where likelihood @xmath82 is based on the renewal process taking account of the forward and backward recurrence times ( @xcite ) and @xmath83 is the above - mentioned geologically estimated slip deformation ratio from slip data .",
    "furthermore , the values of the hyperparameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 characterizing the prior densities of @xmath86 are common to all considered fault segments .",
    "we obtain their estimates by maximizing the integrated posterior distribution @xmath87 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\hspace*{140pt}{}t_{j } , \\phi_{\\mu},\\phi_{\\alpha } ) \\,d\\mu_{j}\\,d\\alpha_{j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath56 represents the @xmath56th segment of @xmath80 fault segments . this maximizing procedure is called the type ii maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the selection of the best combination of the prior distribution factors and the optimal values of the hyper - parameters in ( [ eq12 ] ) are carried out to attain the smallest value of the akaike bayesian information criterion ( _ abic _ ; @xcite ) that is defined by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the number of hyperparameters .",
    "the most common forecast technique is a plug - in method , which is a probability forecast that uses a distribution or conditional intensity function with a parameter set to its estimated value , such as mle .",
    "this method works well if the estimation error is sufficiently small",
    ". however , its predictive performance can be inadequate when the sample size is small .",
    "hence , erc adopts the plug - in method only for @xmath27 and uses a common @xmath35 value of 0.24 throughout japan .",
    "alternatively , @xcite , ogata ( @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite propose the bayesian prediction ( @xcite ) @xmath90 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\hspace*{39pt}{}\\times\\prod_{i = 1}^{n } f ( x_{i}|\\mu,\\alpha ) \\,d\\mu \\,d\\alpha,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the cumulative distribution of the density @xmath92 in ( [ eq10 ] ) , and @xmath93 is the hazard rate function .",
    "this prediction is shown to provide a systematically better performance in the sense of expected entropy criterion ( @xcite ) than the plug - in predictor in case of very small sample sizes of data ( @xcite ) .",
    "bayesian framework can also be used when the occurrence times are uncertain , especially when we are dealing with geological data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in addition to the magnitude dependent model ( @xcite ) based on the time - predictable model ( @xcite ) .",
    "probability gain refers to the ratio of predicted conditional probability relative to baseline earthquake probability .",
    "as far as i know , most probability gains of predictions are not very high , even relative to the stationary poisson process model .",
    "therefore , predictions based on a single anomaly data set alone are not satisfactory for disaster prevention because baseline probability of a large earthquake itself is very small according to the g ",
    "also , the bpt renewal process model has been applied to active fault segments to estimate time - dependent probability on the basis of the last earthquake and stress accumulation rate . in californian ,",
    "probability gain showed an improvement of approximately 1.7 times over poisson process model predictions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key for research progress in practical probability earthquake forecasting is to use a multiple prediction formula ( @xcite ) such that total probability gain is approximately equal to the product of individual probability gains ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rate of probability gain that an individual anomaly was actually a precursor to an earthquake may be calculated as its success rate of the anomaly divided by precursor time ( @xcite ) .",
    "success rate can only be determined from accumulation of actual earthquake occurrences ; and precursor time can be studied experimentally and theoretically ( @xcite ) . in this section",
    "i review important suggestions by @xcite and @xcite and provide some examples of causality modeling toward improved accuracy for probability gain .",
    "the continuing pursuit of possible algorithms used to predict large earthquakes should consider specific developmental patterns listed in the seismic catalog .",
    "so far , an alarm - type method of earthquake prediction ( keilis - borok et al .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; tiampo , et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) based on seismicity patterns has been operationally implemented , in which predictions are conveyed to seismologists through e - mail .",
    "some predictions in each year are published in an official document such as the center for analysis and prediction , state seismological bureau , china ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , many papers have been published on earthquake predictions .",
    "some of these predictions may be statistically significant against the stationary poisson process that is assumed for normal seismicity .",
    "such alarm - type predictions have been further evaluated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "comprehensive studies of anomalous phenomena and observations of earthquake mechanisms are essential for predicting large earthquakes with high probability gains . however , it is difficult to determine whether detected abnormalities are precursors to large earthquakes",
    ". nevertheless , we aspire to become able to say that the probability of occurrence of a large earthquake , in a certain period and a certain region , has increased a certain extent as compared with the reference probability .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate uncertainty of the nature and urgency of abnormal phenomena relative to their roles as precursors to major earthquakes . for this purpose , it is necessary to study a large number of anomalous cases for potential precursory links to large earthquakes .",
    "thus , incorporation of this information in the design of a prediction model for probability that exceeds the underlying probability is important .",
    "as previously described , although an individual precursory anomaly is insufficient for providing a forecast of an earthquake with a high probability , forecasting probability can be enhanced if several anomalies are simultaneously observed ( utsu , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the probability of an anomaly being a precursor of a large earthquake should be estimated through comprehensive observations .",
    "then , it provides medium- or short - term probability forecasts depending on the time scale of enhanced earthquake probability following the anomaly .",

    "moreover , we examined periodicity , or seasonality , of earthquake occurrences ( ogata and katsura , @xcite ; @xcite ) . although such issues have been frequently discussed in statistical seismology , it was difficult to analyze correlations in the conventional method because the clustering feature of earthquakes frequently leads to incorrect results ( aki , @xcite ) . on the other hand , we found it effective to apply statistical models of stochastic point processes that incorporate a clustering component ; further details can be found in the study of @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "these models can also be applied to examine whether or not various geophysical anomalies are statistically significant as precursors of an approaching large earthquake : @xmath122    from estimated amplitudes of the one - year periodic term with @xmath123 days , it is evident that probability gains vary around the average occurrence rate of corresponding @xmath114 and @xmath124 earthquakes .",

    "statistical models , applications to validate data from the earthquake - induced phenomena and their references were reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the study of foreshocks should lead to a short - term forecasting .",
    "although a considerable number of foreshocks are observed , most are recognized after occurrence of a large earthquake . nevertheless",
    ", when earthquakes begin to occur in a local region , its residents should determine whether or not such movement is a precursor of a significantly larger earthquake .",
    "the probability of foreshock type can be determined statistically from the data of ongoing earthquakes in a particular region . moreover , by using composite identification data of magnitude sequence and degree of hypocenter concentration , the probability gain of prediction is heightened .",
    "when an earthquake of m4.0 or larger occurs , it must first be determined whether or not the movement is a continuation of nearby earthquakes .",
    "precisely , the connection to past earthquakes is determined by the single - link clustering ( slc ) algorithm of frohlich and davis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the largest earthquake in a cluster is designated as the main shock .",
    "pre - shocks refer to all earthquakes preceding the main shock of a cluster .",
    "all pre - shocks in a cluster become foreshocks when the magnitude gap or magnitude difference between the largest pre - shock and main shock is 0.45 or greater .",
    "if the magnitude gap is smaller than 0.45 , the cluster with pre - shocks is defined as a swarm .",
    "an additional type of cluster is the main shock  aftershock type , in which the main shock occurs first in the cluster .",
    "a magnitude gap of 0.45 or larger between the main shock and largest pre - shock occurs in less than approximately 20% of pre - shock clusters in japan .",
    "this 0.45 borderline of foreshock- and the swarm - types has been determined by a trade - off between achievement of a larger magnitude gap , which results in better discrimination of the foreshock , and a greater number of foreshock clusters , which results in better statistics . here , to characterize these features",
    ", we note that clusters of foreshock - type exclude main shock and subsequent aftershocks , whereas other cluster types include all events in each cluster .",
    "this designation is made because real - time recognition of the main shock , which is preceded by foreshocks , is easy owing to the large magnitude gap , whereas main shocks of other cluster types are difficult to recognize until the end of the cluster .      using the location ( @xmath50 ) of the first earthquakes from clusters or isolated single earthquakes , by the empirical bayesian logit model , ogata , utsu and katsura ( @xcite ) obtained a map @xmath67 of a probability that the earthquake will be a foreshock of a forthcoming main shock .",

    "it must be noted that interactions between the normalized statistics were not selected in equation ( [ eq23 ] ) by the aic comparison ; namely , independency for the formula ( [ eq15 ] ) is shown between the statistics of time intervals , epicenter separations and magnitude differences .",
    "such conditions can be extended for a case in which the factors are dependent by considering higher order of polynomials ; however , the linear factor in equation  ( [ eq23 ] ) represented the best fit in this case according to aic ( ogata , utsu and katsura , @xcite ) .",
    "probability forecasts that use prediction equation  ( [ eq23 ] ) have been conducted from january 1994 to april 2011 , and their performances have been evaluated by @xcite and @xcite . therefore , these forecasts are expected to be applied for practical use in real time in the near future .",
    "the earth crust and upper mantle lithosphere can be approximately considered as an elastic body . these become distorted under stress , which increases steadily in a particular direction .",
    "fault planes are cracks within the lithosphere or plate boundary interfaces .",
    "earthquakes occur through distortion of subsurface rocks and both sides of the fault plane moving out of alignment .",
    "the earthquake location listed in hypocenter catalogs is location at which a fault displacement started , and magnitude represents eventual size of the displacement .",
    "moreover , some catalogs record the orientations and slips of fault planes of relatively large earthquakes .    for each fault plane , stress tensor in lithosphere is decomposed into two perpendicular components .",
    "the shear stress acts in a direction parallel to fault shifting , and the normal stress acts perpendicular to the fault plane .",
    "the orientation of each fault plane determines shear and normal stress , which define coulomb failure stress ( cfs ) : @xmath152 \\\\[-12pt ] \\nonumber & & { } \\times ( \\mbox{normal stress } - \\mbox{pore fluid pressure}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] cfs increases at a constant rate over time .",
    "when cfs exceeds a particular threshold , the fault slips dramatically ( an earthquake ) .",
    "then , the stress reduces to a certain value and accumulates again over decades to result in large earthquakes on plate boundaries , and over thousands of years to result in slips on inland active faults ( see section  [ sec2.3 ] ) .",
    "when an earthquake occurs , the displacement of the source fault causes sudden coulomb stress changes ( @xmath153cfs ) on the peripheral receiver faults .",
    "the @xmath153cfs of each receiver fault plane either decreases or increases depending on its orientations relative to the slip angles of the source fault . on the faults with increased @xmath153cfs , earthquakes occur earlier than expected , whereas on those with decreased @xmath153cfs , forthcoming earthquakes are delayed . when faults of similar orientations dominate a region , either seismic activation or quiescence",
    "is expected in the region .    in equation ( [ eq24 ] ) , the pore fluid pressure of the gap fault related to cfs is generally a constant .",
    "however , its changes may be important .",
    "for example , pressure changes in the fluid magma gap affect swarm activity in volcanic areas ( dieterich , cayol and okubo , @xcite ; toda , stein and sagiya , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , earthquakes can be induced through increased pore fluid pressure in a fault system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is occasionally due to heavy rainfall or shaking of the earth crust owing to propagated strong seismic waves ; the latter causes dynamic triggering ( steacy , gomberg and cocco , @xcite , and papers included in the same volume ) .",
    "relevantly , the seasonal nature of seismicity or annual periodicity has been discussed in section  [ sec3.3 ] [ cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq22 ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , the etas model applications to seismicity changes that were induced by dynamic triggering or injection of water were reported ( lei et al . , @xcite , lei , xie and fu , @xcite ) .",
    "to explain earthquake induction or suppression of seismicity , it is useful to determine whether or not @xmath153cfs was due to a rapid faulting event that caused an earthquake .",
    "when a large earthquake occurs , low - frequency seismic waves and global positioning system ( gps ) crustal displacement are observed . from such observations ,",
    "source fault mechanisms of the earthquake can be solved , such as size , orientation and vector of the fault slip .",
    "such source parameters are input into a computer program designed by @xcite to calculate @xmath153cfs in a receiver fault system on the basis of source fault data .",
    "thus , studies on induction of earthquakes , based on @xmath153cfs , have become popular .",
    "special issue volumes on this subject have been edited by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite examined regional @xmath153cfs in southwestern japan by analyzing m7.9 tonankai and m8.1 nankai earthquakes in 1944 and 1946 , respectively .",
    "conventionally , some seismic quiescence in this period was either considered as a genuine precursor or suspected as an artifact because of incomplete detection of earthquakes during the second world war .",
    "positive and negative @xmath153cfs correlated strongly with seismic activation and quiescence , respectively . in particular , this study classified seismicity anomalies into pre - seismic , coseismic and post - seismic before , during and after massive earthquakes , respectively .",
    "these scenarios may be helpful in interpreting seismicity in western japan prior to occurrences of expected subsequent large earthquakes along the nankai trough .      in general , interactions among earthquakes are fairly complex .",
    "once an earthquake occurs in a particular location , cfs of the fault system adjacent to the source fault is considerably increased , and many earthquakes are induced . traditionally , these earthquakes are called as aftershocks .",
    "some of them are induced outside the aftershock region ; these are also called as off - fault aftershocks , or aftershocks in a broad sense .",
    "significant changes in stress result in many aftershocks ; even small changes can induce aftershocks to some extent .",
    "furthermore , any aftershock can change stress , too , causing their aftershocks . because of such complex interactions among invisible fault segments in the crust , detailed calculations of such stress changes are difficult and impractical .    therefore",
    ", statistical models designed to describe the actual macroscopic outcome of these stress interactions are required .",
    "for example , the etas model in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , which consists of empirical laws of aftershocks , quantifies dynamic forecasting of induced effects . by fitting to the selected data from the catalog earthquake",
    ", this etas model determines the parameters by the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "thus , prediction of earthquakes conforming to regional diversity is possible .",
    "on the other hand , the friction law of dieterich ( @xcite ) , which was developed on the basis of rock fracture experiments with controlled stress , can be linked to statistical laws of earthquake occurrences .",
    "in particular , this law reproduces temporal and spatial distribution of the attenuation rate of aftershocks , such as that determined by the o  u law in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "however , because of seismicity diversity , predictions adapting well to development of seismicity appear to be difficult .",
    "seismicity anomalies can hardly be detected by observing conventional plots of earthquake series because they show a complex generation due to successive occurrences of earthquakes or clustering .",
    "the clustering nature is also the main difficulty for traditional statistical test analysis .",
    "complexity due to the clustering feature creates difficulties in revealing anomalies of seismicity caused by slight stress changes , hence , various anomalous signals are missed .",
    "[ f04 ]    therefore , some seismologists have devised various declustering methods that include only isolated and largest earthquakes in a clustering group or the main shock , and other earthquakes are excluded . on the basis of declustered data , statistical significance of seismic quiescence was tested against the poisson process . occasionally , however , analysis results depend on the choice of criteria of the adopted declustering algorithm ( van  stiphout , zhuang and marsan , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , results could be due to artificial treatment .",
    "in addition , declustering methods result in a significant loss of information because they discard a large amount of data from the original catalog .",
    "the etas model uses original earthquake data without declustering . as mentioned in section  [ sec2.2.3 ] ,",
    "the etas model is a point process model configured to conform to empirical laws derived from various studies such as aftershocks in japan and the time evolution of seismicity rate .",
    "because regional characteristics of earthquake occurrences can be captured and considered as typical seismicity in this model , it has been accepted by seismologists as a standard model of ordinary seismicity .",
    "the etas model is used as a `` barometer '' for detecting significant deviations from normal activities as demonstrated in figure  [ f04 ] in ogata ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deviation of actual cumulative number of earthquakes is measured relative to the theoretical cumulative function of the earthquake that serves as an indefinite integral in time for the predicted rate function ( [ eq7 ] ) of the etas model .",
    "relative quiescence occurs when actual earthquake occurrence rates are systematically lowered in comparison with the predicted incidence that is determined by the etas model ( @xcite ) .",
    "relative quiescence lasting for many years was observed in a broad region before great earthquakes of m8 class and larger occurred in and near japan ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similar phenomena were observed before m9-class large earthquakes in other regions of the world.=1    since 2001 , i have reported 25 agendas of various seismicity anomalies and forecasting proposals in japan at the coordinating committee for earthquake prediction of japan ( ccep ) . except the agenda that reported seismic quiescence of aftershock activity before the largest aftershock ( see section  [ sec6.2 ] for detail ) ,",
    "all were ex - post analysis report ; the agendas were summarized in @xcite . in addition , among 76 aftershock cases in japan that i have investigated , relative quiescence was observed in 34 ( see @xcite , and its appendix for details of the case studies ) .",
    "moreover , section  [ sec5.4 ] includes a discussion on the manner in which results of this aftershock study will be used for space  time probability prediction of a neighboring large earthquake with a size similar to that of the main shock.=1    here , i will note the results on the aftershock research of inland earthquakes of m6.0 or larger in southwestern japan that occurred 30 years before and after the m8.1 nankai earthquake in 1946 . among six earthquakes which occurred before 1946 ,",
    "relative quiescence was observed in five aftershock sequences .",
    "in contrast , among seven earthquakes after 1946 , relative quiescence was not observed in six aftershock sequences , and these aftershock sequences were on track as expected .",
    "since the erc forecasts the next large earthquake for the next 30 years 6070% ( see section  [ sec2.3 ] , also see ogata , @xcite and @xcite ) , it would be worthy to monitor recent and future aftershock activity of similar large inland earthquakes .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      since a dense gps observation network was established in japan , aseismic fault motions or slow slips that could not be detected by seismometers have been successively identified in the plate boundary regions .",
    "we can take occurrence of such motion into account in discussing the relationship between seismicity anomalies ( quiescence or activation ) and stress changes .",
    "specifically , it can be assumed that slow slips on a focal fault or its adjacent part have occurred during a particular period .",
    "then , depending on dominating orientations of receiver faults neighboring the focal fault , cfs could decrease or increase .",
    "accordingly , we expect that seismicity there decrease or increase relative to the expected occurrence rate by the etas model .",
    "such seismicity anomalies are revealed before some recent large earthquakes ( ogata , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; and kumazawa , ogata and toda , @xcite ) .",
    "see figure  [ f05 ] for an example . by assuming slow slip on the source fault ,",
    "the peripheral regions were classified as either of the increasing or decreasing cfs .",
    "then , each region can theoretically correspond to an area that either promoted or suppressed seismicity .",
    "such anomaly patterns of seismicity relative to the etas model ( [ eq5 ] ) are in good agreement with those of cfs increment .",
    "local anomalies occur in space ",
    "time locations of most of the aftershocks . to elucidate these anomalies",
    ", we firstly apply the o  u formula ( [ eq2 ] ) for aftershock decay to data of occurrence times and convert these times by the estimated theoretical cumulative function ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "we then examine whether space ",
    "time coordinates on a projected line , such as longitude and latitude , against the converted time remained temporally uniform or not .",
    "if nonuniformity in a certain portion of space  time conversion is observed , this implies discrepancies between theoretical and actual aftershock occurrences in such a place .",
    "several possible scenarios for such discrepancies are offered : secondary aftershocks that follow a large aftershock are obvious once seen as a cluster .",
    "such a cluster shows traces of a new local rupture to extend the peripheral portion of the fault of the main shock .",
    "moreover , when a nonuniform portion other than the secondary aftershocks is observed , it is crucial for us to explore the reasons .",
    "based on recent accurate aftershock location data , @xcite revealed local relative quiescence and activations ; these can occur associated with post- or pre - slips of a large aftershock .",
    "these anomalies were systematically investigated assuming that they were related to changes in the cfs rate .",
    "in addition , assuming several scenarios of stress changes due to slow slips , @xcite and @xcite performed simulations to reproduce seismicity anomalies of relative activation and quiescence within aftershocks on the basis of the rate / state friction law of @xcite .",
    "the probability of relative quiescence being precursor to a large earthquake must be evaluated with their likely time and location .",
    "because these involve many conditions and a number of parameters , they can not be easily stated . however , by statistical studies of aftershock sequences in japan ( ogata , @xcite ) , what i can say about a probability gain that a large earthquake will occur is as follows : first , if a large earthquake occurred in a particular location , the probability per unit area that another earthquake of similar magnitude will occur in the vicinity is greater than that which will occur in a distant area .",
    "this is the result of simple statistics regarding the self - similarity feature ( inverse - power law correlations ) , and also physically suggests that the neighboring earthquake will be more probably induced by a sudden stress change on the periphery because of the abrupt slip of the earthquake .",
    "moreover , if aftershock activity becomes relatively quiet , it becomes more likely that large aftershocks will occur around the boundary of the aftershock area .",
    "furthermore , if relative quiescence lasts for a sufficiently long time more than a few months , the probability that another earthquake of similar magnitude will increase within six years in the vicinity of the aftershock area within 200  km distance .",
    "the geological survey institute ( gsi ) of japan compiles daily geodetic locations of global positioning system ( gps ) stations throughout japan , and baseline distances between gps stations can be calculated from data in the gps catalog .",
    "the geodetic time series show that contraction or extension of the distance between stations is basically linear with time because the subducting plate converges with constant speed .",
    "however , several years prior to large inland earthquakes of m7 class , the time series of the baseline distance variation around the fault was observed with systematic deviation from a linear trend ( ogata , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; kumazawa , ogata and toda , @xcite ; gsi , @xcite ) .",
    "each deviation of these baselines was consistently explained by slow slips on the earthquake source fault or on its down - dip extension .",
    "these results were due to post - hoc analysis based on knowledge of the source fault obtained by coseismic displacement .    from a predictive perspective , it is highly desirable to estimate such a fault slip in near real - time to that of occurrence . so far , several estimates of sufficiently large slips on plate boundaries have been obtained from gps records by inversion analysis .",
    "gsi has regularly reported such estimates of coseismic , post - seismic and large - size habitual slips , at the ccep meeting .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain fine images of small slips , particularly in inland , even though inland gps stations are arranged closely .",
    "this is attributed to high seismicity rather than gps observation errors .",
    "because strong earthquakes occur frequently , various effects of slow slips in gps records are mixed up with such stronger changes .",
    "hence , development of statistical models and methods to separate such signals is crucial . to estimate slow slips",
    "more precisely , combined modeling and analysis of seismicity and geodetic anomalies will be useful .",
    "analyzing both seismicity and transient geodetic movements in a number of areas and locating the area of aseismic slip is very important for increasing the probability gain of a large earthquake .",
    "observed anomalies of crustal movement and seismicity assume fault mechanisms and locations of slip precursors for prediction probability ; therefore , their uncertainty must be estimated .",
    "in addition , probabilities of considered scenarios must be estimated .",
    "such tasks are difficult .",
    "a possible method is to consider the logic tree of various scenarios regarding destruction of the fault system by attaching appropriate subjective or objective probabilities to tree components , as was performed for long - term predictions in california and japan .",
    "hence , such a scenario ensemble gives a forecast probability .",
    "similarly , medium- and short - term prediction logic trees of various scenarios must be considered .    at the ccep meeting on april 6 , 2005 ,",
    "i reported relative quiescence of aftershocks of the fukuoka ",
    "oki earthquake ( ogata , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , i examined potential slow slip areas on nearby active faults that may have created a stress shadow ( region of decreased cfs ) to cause relative quiescence in the aftershock sequence . among these areas , the kego fault , traversing fukuoka city , had a large positive @xmath153cfs because of the main shock rupture , which showed evidence of possible slow - slip induction . furthermore , the seismogenic zone along the kego fault had already activated before the fukuoka ",
    "oki earthquake occurred ( @xcite ) . therefore , because a slow - slip scenario on this fault was possible , i examined the pattern causing stress variation in the aftershock area .",
    "however , no stress shadow in the aftershock area was found .",
    "therefore , i determined that probability of slow slip on the kego fault was quite low .",
    "i also examined whether other possible slow slips in neighboring active faults could create a stress shadow that covered the aftershock region .",
    "however , no large earthquake has occurred in those faults thus far .",
    "approximately one month later , however , the largest aftershock occurred at the southeast end of the aftershock zone .",
    "post - mortem examination based on information of the fault mechanism of this aftershock and detailed aftershock data revealed a detailed scenario .",
    "this means that by assuming a slow slip into the gap between the fault of the largest aftershock and main shock , relative quiescence of activity in the deeper part of the aftershock zone can be clearly explained ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the slip can explain relative quiescence in the induced swarm activity that occurred away from the aftershock area ( @xcite ) .",
    "this setting as a prediction of future scenarios is much more vague and difficult to explain , even if it includes an ex - post scenario .",
    "moreover , the time of occurrence must be predicted in addition to location , which is more difficult .",
    "occurrence of slow slip does not always indicate a proximate precursor of fault corruption .",
    "nevertheless , it is desired to keep observing gps data to form scenarios of forthcoming large earthquake .",
    "for example , using bayesian inversion by using gps records , @xcite estimated the locked zones on the plate boundary , where the next great earthquakes are expected .",
    "to predict the future of a complex and diverse earthquake generation process , probability forecasting can not be avoided .",
    "the likelihood ( log - likelihood ) is rational to measure the performance of the prediction . to provide a standard stochastic prediction of seismic activity in long term and short term ,",
    "it is necessary to construct proper point process models and revise those that conform to each region . by the appearance of the anomaly",
    ", we need to evaluate the probability that it will be a precursor to a large earthquake .",
    "namely , we need to forecast that the probability in a space  time zone will increase to an extent , relative to those of the reference probability . for this",
    ", we make use of a point process model for the causality relationship .",
    "it is desired to search any anomaly phenomena that enhance the probability gains .",
    "having such anomalies , application of the multiple element prediction formula increases a precursory probability .",
    "a comprehensive physical study between precursory phenomena and earthquake mechanisms is essential for composing useful point process models .",
    "these elements must be incorporated to achieve predicted probability exceeding predictions of typical statistical models .",
    "furthermore , to determine urgency and uncertainty of major earthquakes against abnormal phenomena , numerous research examples must be accumulated .",
    "on the basis of these examples , possible prediction scenarios must be presented .",
    "furthermore , to adapt well to diversity of earthquake generation , it is useful to adopt bayesian predictions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and consider region - specific models .",
    "my experiences thus far confirm that the method of statistical science is essential to elucidate movement leading to prediction of a complex system .",
    "there is a need for development of a forecasting model that reflects diversity of the vast amount of information on seismicity and various covariate data .",
    "i believe that these will be developed by inventing an appropriate hierarchical bayesian model .",
    "time models for seismicity have become increasingly complicated ( ogata , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar evolution is required for statistical models of geodetic gps data .",

    "<S> earthquakes occur because of abrupt slips on faults due to accumulated stress in the earth s crust . because most of these faults and their mechanisms are not readily apparent , deterministic earthquake prediction is difficult . for effective prediction , complex conditions and uncertain elements must be considered , which necessitates stochastic prediction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a  large amount of uncertainty lies in identifying whether abnormal phenomena are precursors to large earthquakes , as well as in assigning urgency to the earthquake . </S>",
    "<S> any discovery of potentially useful information for earthquake prediction is incomplete unless quantitative modeling of risk is considered . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this manuscript describes the prospect of earthquake predictability research to realize practical operational forecasting in the near future . </S>"
