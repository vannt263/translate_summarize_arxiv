    "there are in general two approaches to describe the behavior of multi - phase fluids , the sharp interface ( si ) and the diffuse interface ( di ) approach .",
    "the first approach represents multiple phases with different sets of equations that are coupled by some interface conditions .",
    "the second approach , which used to describe , e.g. the merging process of droplets and bubbles , needs only one set of equations to model the phases and does not require the location of the interface to be tracked explicitly .    in this paper , we consider two di models for a homogeneous two - phase compressible fluid : the navier - stokes - korteweg system ( nsk ) and a relaxation system for the nsk system .",
    "the nsk system goes back to the work of korteweg @xcite and was formulated in its present form in @xcite .",
    "the nsk system uses a van - der - waals like pressure function to identify two distinct phases and a third - order term to model phase transitions .",
    "many authors achieved analytical results on the well - posedness of the nsk system and its variants , e.g. @xcite .",
    "while some numerical methods have been successfully developed and used for these and related families of problems , see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , there are still many open problems , for which accurate and efficient numerical methods are yet to be designed . up to our knowledge , the robust computation of realistic density values for liquid and vapor phases has not been suggested for the nsk model .",
    "additionally , numerical methods also fail in cases when very small interface widths close to a sharp interface are to be considered . in both cases ,",
    "the occurring problems are related to steep density gradients .",
    "another source of difficulty one comes across while numerically solving nsk systems is related to the van - der - waals like form of the pressure equation .",
    "the latter prevents one from using upwind hyperbolic solvers , which have been successfully applied , e.g. , to stabilize computations for navier - stokes equations with high reynolds numbers .",
    "the issue of very small interfaces is especially important because the nsk model can only provide the correct amount of capillary forces if the interface is extremely small @xcite .",
    "one idea to loosen the strict coupling between interfacial width and capillary forces is to introduce an additional cahn - hilliard or allen - cahn type equation for a new phase field variable .",
    "this was done for example in @xcite .",
    "another ansatz to avoid some of the difficulties for the nsk systems suggests to introduce a relaxation of the nsk system , in which the third - order term is replaced by a first - order term and a poisson equation , that defines a new phase field parameter , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this model is parametrized by a so - called korteweg parameter @xmath0 .",
    "if the korteweg parameter tends to zero , the relaxation system formally converges to the nsk system .",
    "the most important feature of the relaxation system is the fact , that the first - order part is purely hyperbolic for sufficiently small korteweg parameter .",
    "it should also be observed that the addition of the poisson equation to the system does not increase the computational cost of numerical simulations as test cases demonstrate that the time savings , that come from the fact that one does not have to solve a third order system , are greater than the loss of time that comes from the numerical solution of the poisson equation .",
    "these properties can be exploited to construct robust numerical schemes for the relaxation system . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the overall approach is robust for problems with large density ratios and small interfacial widths .",
    "however , the numerical scheme proposed in @xcite is an explicit scheme and thus the time steps decrease as the korteweg parameter @xmath0 tends to zero .",
    "it is the main purpose of this contribution to construct an asymptotic - preserving ( ap ) scheme @xcite in the korteweg limit , that is , a scheme for the relaxation system that provides a consistent approximation of the original nsk system as the korteweg parameter @xmath0 tends to zero .",
    "the ap approach was developed in the framework of linear transport in diffusive regimes @xcite and has been applied to many different areas , e.g. fluid and diffusion limits of kinetic models , relaxation methods for hyperbolic systems and low - mach number limits for compressible flow problems ; see , e.g. , @xcite . in @xcite , the time and spatial discretization of the isentropic euler and navier - stokes equations in the low mach number limit was investigated .",
    "inspired by this research , we construct here a scheme that captures the korteweg limit for the relaxation system and prove the ap property of the proposed scheme .",
    "the ap property of the new scheme is achieved by splitting the relaxation system into a non - stiff nonlinear , compressible hyperbolic navier - stokes like system and a system that can be treated by a poisson solver , and allows the use of time and spatial steps that are independent of the korteweg parameter .",
    "as the result the proposed numerical scheme is very efficient for small values of the parameter @xmath0 , which is a significant improvement compared to an explicit scheme from @xcite . beyond that , we expect our scheme to be asymptotic preserving in the sharp interface limit .",
    "we can not give analytical proof to that , but we support this statement by a numerical example .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nsk ] , we introduce the nsk and relaxation systems and describe their main properties together with the basic thermodynamical framework .",
    "we comment on the advantages of the relaxation system and point out why it is necessary to introduce a new scheme in order to solve the relaxation system efficiently .",
    "section [ sec : allspeed ] contains the basic outcome of this contribution .",
    "we propose the ap scheme for the relaxation system and perform an asymptotic analysis to show that the scheme transforms into a scheme for the nsk equations in the korteweg limit . in section [ sec : numerics ] , we demonstrate that the algorithm provides a massive improvement compared to a standard explicit scheme for a number of problems in one and two space dimensions .",
    "let an open set @xmath1 up to the final time @xmath2 be given .",
    "the isentropic navier - stokes - korteweg ( nsk ) equations in arbitrary spatial dimension are given by @xmath3}+\\gamma{\\varepsilon}^2\\rho\\nabla\\delta\\rho , \\end{aligned}\\right.({{\\bf x}},t)\\in\\omega\\times(0,t),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the density of the fluid , @xmath5 is its momentum and @xmath6 is the pressure .",

    "the lack of hyperbolicity in the first - order part of ( [ eq : nsk ] ) and the presence of the third - order derivative in the momentum balance make the numerical solution of ( [ eq : nsk ] ) to be a challenging task : explicit schemes suffer from extremely small time steps while implicit discretizations lead to badly conditioned algebraic problems .",

    "we refer to @xcite for first rigorous results on the korteweg limit .",

    "the cpu - times are constant .",
    "we recall ( [ eq : cfl ] ) and see that the diffusive term dominates for larger @xmath7 while the convective term does so for smaller @xmath7 .",
    "additionally , the solution of the fast system is very time consuming for the small time steps that occur for larger @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , it is a nice feature of the ap scheme , that it is faster for smaller and thus more realistic @xmath7 .      in this example , we compute a numerical solution to the relaxation system ( [ eq : ansk ] ) in the 2-d case .",
    "we start with 22 bubbles in a bounded box @xmath65 filled with liquid .",
    "we choose @xmath66 .",

    "the fluid seems to be in an equilibrium configuration .",
    "note that the position of the bubbles and the coalescence dynamics are the same for both gird widths . even though we are not able to resolve the interface by the underlying grid due to cpu time constraints , the results show the desired behavior for a two - phase system .",
    "the computations for different grid sizes support the statement , that the behavior of the solution is not only qualitatively but also quantitatively correct .",
    "however , to be absolutely sure , one has to compare it with a fully resolved solution . in order to run such a simulation",
    ", one would need to implement a scheme that incorporates adaptive time and spatial stepping , which is out of the scope of the current paper .",
    "in this work , we presented a new asymptotic - preserving scheme for a relaxation of the navier - stokes - korteweg system .",
    "the method has two key ingredients .",
    "first , we introduced a modified pressure that guarantees that the euler part of the system is hyperbolic .",
    "second , we split the relaxation system into a non linear conservative system for the slow dynamics and a non conservative stiff system for the fast dynamics that come from the korteweg term .",
    "we showed that our scheme is asymptotic preserving , i.e. it converges to a numerical scheme for the navier - stokes - korteweg equations on the fully discrete level .",
    "we supported this result with several numerical tests . in all test cases ,",
    "the solutions showed the expected behavior .",
    "we were able to compute large density ratios and small interfacial widths for fixed grid widths and we were able to obtain approximate solutions of the same quality as those of an explicit scheme , but with significantly smaller computational costs .",
    "additionally , our scheme showed to be asymptotic preserving in the sharp interface limit in our numerical tests .",
    "note that up to now we have not been able to give analytical proof to that .",
    "the numerical proof of the asymptotic preserving property is one goal for future work .",
    "this is by no means an easy task , because the system has a jump of the density at the phase boundaries .",
    "therefore one needs to impose special coupling conditions at the interface and to introduce an interface tracking algorithm .",
    "another main goal is the extension of the numerical algorithm to three space dimensions . in order to accomplish this",
    ", we will look to introduce an adaptive time and spatial stepping and to use a discontinuous galerkin formulation instead of the finite volume formulation .",
    "these two extensions guarantee that the solution of the linear system remains efficient , because we are able to control the number of cells , even if we need to refine the grid at the interface .",
    "this could prove to be important for the simulation of realistic two - phase flow examples such as underwater explosions .",
