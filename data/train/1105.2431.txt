    "it is easy to see ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that in @xmath27-dimensional case any periodic laplace - beltrami operator has no gaps .",

    "these results were generalized by f. lledo and o. post @xcite to the case of periodic manifolds with non - abelian group @xmath13 .    also p. exner and o. post @xcite proved the existence of gaps for some graph - like manifolds ,",
    "i.e. the manifolds which shrink with respect to an appropriate parameter to a graph .",
    "we remark that ( i.e. the existence of gaps in the spectrum ) was studied in @xcite for periodic divergence type elliptic operators in @xmath25 , in @xcite for periodic magnetic schrdinger operator , and in @xcite for periodic maxwell operator . in these",

    "we want not only to construct a new type of periodic riemannian manifolds with gaps in the spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator but also be able _ to control the edges of these gaps_. namely the goal of the work is to solve the following problem : for an arbitrary finite set of pairwise disjoint finite intervals on the positive semi - axis to construct a periodic riemannian manifolds @xmath1 with at least @xmath2 gaps in the spectrum of @xmath3 ( here @xmath2 is the number of the preassigned intervals ) , moreover the first @xmath2 gaps have to be `` close '' to the preassigned intervals , and the remaining gaps ( if any ) have to be `` close '' to infinity .",
