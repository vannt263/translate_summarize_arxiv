    "recently , stochastic nature in small systems has attracted many attentions @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting examples of the stochasticity is a gene regulatory system ; it has been known experimentally that the gene regulatory systems show various phenomena caused by intrinsic noise @xcite .",
    "the gene regulatory systems basically consists of genes , rnas , and proteins .",
    "the genes could sometimes be activated or repressed by regulatory proteins known as transcription factors .",
    "the number of regulatory proteins is sometimes very small , and there are large fluctuations . from a theoretical point of view , the gene regulatory systems have been studied a lot using monte carlo simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition , in order to gain insights into mechanisms or functions of the gene regulatory systems , many analytical studies have been done @xcite .",
    "for example , if we consider a self - regulating gene with monomer binding interactions , an exact solution has been already known @xcite . when one considers more complicated systems , some approximations are needed .",
    "such approximations have also been developed ; fokker - planck or langevin equation approach @xcite , a variational approach @xcite , and self - consistent proteomic field approximation @xcite .",
    "a gene regulatory system with only two genes and feedback mechanisms has been studied a lot because it plays an important role as a genetic switch ; two distinct stable states emerges , and they could be switched either spontaneously or by external signals . in mathematical description for the gene regulatory systems ,",
    "the rnas are sometimes neglected for simplicity , and only genes and regulatory proteins are considered .",
    "when we construct a macroscopic rate equation , in which fluctuations in protein copy numbers or gene expression states are neglected , the analysis for the rate equation tells us the following facts : a system with two mutually repressing genes shows a bistability , and cooperative binding of regulatory proteins is important for making the bistability @xcite .",
    "here , the cooperative binding means that combinations of two or more proteins need to activate or repress genes .",
    "the macroscopic rate equation gives multiple stable solutions , and each solution corresponds to a stable state of the gene regulatory systems , which causes the bistability .",
    "hence , for the cooperative binding cases , it may be enough to use the macroscopic treatments in order to investigate qualitative behavior of the bistability .",
    "however , other studies have shown that a so - called exclusive switch shows a bistability even when the macroscopic rate equations have only one solution @xcite .",
    "although the bistability has been confirmed numerically using monte carlo simulations , no exact or approximated analytical treatment has been proposed yet , to the best of our knowledge .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop a new approximation scheme for gene regulatory systems . in the approximation scheme",
    ", there is no need to use continuous description such as fokker - planck or langevin equations , and hence the smallness or discrete properties of the system are not neglected .",
    "the basic idea of the approximation is similar to the `` self - consistent proteomic field approximation '' developed by walczak _",
    "_ @xcite . in the self - consistent proteomic field approximation , a joint probability for all genes",
    "is approximated as a product of probability distributions for each gene , and then the interactions between genes and regulatory proteins can be evaluated ` exactly ' in this approximation . in @xcite , only toggle switches , which consist of two genes , have been studied ; as denoted in the discussions in @xcite , further approximation would be needed for self - regulating systems .",
    "we here extend the concept of @xcite , and develop a more applicable approximation scheme ; the interactions between genes and regulatory proteins are approximated firstly , and an effective interaction is introduced .",
    "the new approximation scheme would be useful to treat more complicated cases , such as the exclusive switch .",
    "the new approximation scheme enables us to give analytical expressions for probability distributions of the numbers of proteins , without loss of the discreteness property of the system .",
    "the effective interactions are estimated self - consistently .",
    "we will demonstrate the usefulness of the approximation scheme by using self - regulating systems and the exclusive switch without cooperative interactions .",

    "iii , self - regulating systems are studied .",

    "the proposed approximation scheme is applied to the exclusive switch in sec .",
    "section v is concluding remarks .",
    "we here briefly review the basic biology of genetic regulatory system and a simplified stochastic model , for readers convenience .",
    "a gene regulatory system consists of many components , such as genes , rnas , and proteins .",
    "the transcription of a gene is initiated by a binding of rna polymerase to a promoter site of the gene in the dna .",
    "the binding of regulatory proteins ( or molecules ) , so - called transcription factors , can sometimes regulate the transcription initiation .",
    "these regulatory proteins bind to own target operator sites , and they sometimes act as repressors ( which repress the transcription ) or activators ( which enhance the transcription ) of the transcription . when the rna polymerase binds to a gene , the gene sequence is copied into a messenger rna ( mrna ) , and the mrna is translated into a protein molecules by a ribosome enzyme complex .",
    "the produced proteins are important to determine the phenotypic behavior of the cell .",
    "in addition , regulation of transcription is one important way of controlling the phenotypic behavior , and sometimes the produced proteins can become regulatory signals for genes .",
    "although all of the above reactions would be important for the gene regulatory systems , the mrna is sometimes neglected in stochastic modelling for simplicity .",
    "that is , the translation from mrnas to proteins are straightforward , and then we assume that an activated gene directly increases the number of proteins .",
    "in addition , we consider that a repressed gene can not produce any proteins , which makes analytical treatments much simpler @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , all regulatory proteins act as repressors .",
    "if regulatory proteins are not binding to a gene , then we call a state of the gene as ` on ' state ; if not , the gene is in ` off ' state .",
    "a gene in off state can not produce any proteins , as we assumed above .",
    "in this section , we will explain a new approximation scheme using a simplest model , i.e. , a self - regulating system .",
    "exact solutions for the self - regulating system with monomer interactions have already been known . after reviewing the exact solutions",
    ", we will propose a new approximation scheme .",
    "the new approximation scheme will be applied to the self - regulating systems with monomer and dimer interactions , respectively .          at first",
    ", we give a brief explanation for a self - regulating system . in the self - regulating system , there is only one gene , and it produces proteins .",
    "the produced proteins are considered as regulatory proteins for the gene , and the regulation is a repressed one . in this sense , there is a self - regulation mechanism .",
    "figure  [ fig_self_regulation ] shows the self - regulating system .",
    "when the gene is in on state , it produces proteins with rate @xmath0 .",
    "the degradation rate of the regulatory proteins is @xmath1 .",
    "the regulatory proteins can bind the gene with rate function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of ` free ' regulatory proteins .",

    "@xmath7 is the rate with which the regulatory protein is released from the repressor site of the gene .",

    "width=188 ]    in order to make analytical treatments simpler , one assumption should be included @xcite ; i.e. , one of the proteins in on state is inert , and then the protein can not be degraded or repress to the gene .",

    "however , it has already been discussed that this assumption alter only for lower numbers of proteins , and actually it gives quantitatively good results @xcite .",
    "hence , we here employ this assumption .",

    "the degradation rate of the proteins , i.e. , the change from @xmath11 to @xmath13 , is proportional to the number of proteins , @xmath3 .",
