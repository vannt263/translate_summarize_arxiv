    "the complexity of a relativistic treatment of the emc effect provides the standard excuse for studying non - relativistic ( nr ) models . while being aware of the many features which have no nr analog , a solution of a model may furnish selective insight . as an example we mention a proof of asymptotic freedom of non - relativistically confined constituents @xcite .",
    "most treatments of the emc effects have used the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) which leads to some form of a convolution for the structure function of the composite nucleus @xcite and one is inclined to do the same in the nr approach .",

    "<S> we study the response of a nucleus composed of nucleons and confined quarks . assuming dynamics implied by a non - relativistic cluster model , we prove that the total response is a convolution of the responses of , respectively , a nucleus with interacting point - nucleons and an isolated nucleon with confined quarks . defining as an intermediary structure functions in terms of the non - relativistic limit of light - cone variables , we subsequently conjecture a generalization to the relativistic regime . </S>",
    "<S> that result contains a nuclear part with full inter - nucleon dynamics and allows the study of approximations , as are the plane wave impulse approximation and a modification of it . </S>",
    "<S> the framework also permits a clean treatment of the response of a moving composite nucleon in the nucleus which may be off - shell . </S>"
