    "the @xmath2 was discovered about 20 years ago in @xmath3 collisions at cleo  @xcite and cusb  @xcite .",
    "its mass is @xmath4  mev , about 300 mev higher than the @xmath5 resonance , and its width of @xmath6  mev is about five times larger than the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "its production cross - section was measured to be about 0.3  nb , about ten times lower than the @xmath5 cross - section .",
    "owing to its mass , the @xmath2 can decay to a variety of final states containing @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the accessible @xmath0-meson final states include : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; final states with @xmath1 are : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "further study of the @xmath2 is of great interest because of it being a potentially large source of @xmath1 mesons at an @xmath3 machine .",
    "if suitably large samples can be collected , their study would provide a complementary probe of cp violation and rare decays to lhcb .",
    "studies involving rare decays , particularly those with soft photons , and untagged time - dependent and time - independent measurements , which provide access to the width difference between the @xmath1 mass eigenstates , @xmath17 , offer complementary information to measurements at hadron machines  @xcite . because of the small lorentz boost at the @xmath2 and the large value of the mixing frequency , @xmath18  @xcite , time - dependent cp violation measurements in mixing are not possible .    until recently",
    ", there existed only weak limits on the production rate of @xmath1 at the @xmath2 .",
    "several models attempt to describe the hadronic cross - section in the 10 - 11 gev region .",
    "the simplest model , the quark - pair creation model ( qpc )  @xcite , allows for quark pairs to be ` popped ' out of the vacuum .",
    "this model by itself is insufficient to describe the hadronic cross - section .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite are able to reproduce the spectrum by introducing a @xmath19 hybrid at 10683 mev ( the qhm model ) . a third model , the unitarized quark model ( uqm )  @xcite includes coupled channel effects between @xmath20 states via real ( two - meson ) intermediate states .",
    "the qhm predicts @xmath8 is dominant at 10865  mev , with relative rates of @xmath9:@xmath8:@xmath7 @xmath21 1:3:6 . on the other hand",
    ", the uqm also reproduces the hadronic cross - section , but predicts that @xmath9 is dominant , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xmath9:@xmath8:@xmath7",
    "2:1:0.3 .    a more thorough experimental study of the @xmath2 has been undertaken by cleo , followed by belle , to better understand the hadronic cross - section in this region as well as assess the potential for a future high luminosity @xmath3 machine operating at the @xmath2 . in 2003 , cleo collected 0.42  @xmath22 of data at the @xmath2 ( 10871 mev ) in 2005 , belle collected about 1.9  @xmath22 on the @xmath2 resonance , followed by a larger sample of 22  @xmath22 a year later . here",
    "we report on results from cleo and the first belle data set .",
    "the hadronic resonance cross section is measured by counting hadronic events recorded at the @xmath2 using various selection criteria employed to reduce the continuum background .",
    "the continuum background is estimated using data taken below the @xmath5 , and is scaled by : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the integrated luminosities and center - of - mass energies squared at the @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 cross - sections are measured to be @xmath26  nb  @xcite and @xmath27  nb  @xcite , by cleo and belle , respectively .",
    "many of the same techniques of exclusive reconstruction that are employed at the @xmath5 are used to reconstruct @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons at the @xmath2 .",
    "the kinematic variables @xmath28 and the beam - energy constrained mass , @xmath29 are used . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the beam energy and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the energy ( momentum ) of the @xmath0 candidate .",
    "because of the proximity of the @xmath1 mass to the beam energy , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are kinematically well - separated . for @xmath0 mesons , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath13",
    "are also kinematically separated .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 occupy a broad , but distinct region in @xmath33 and overlap with one another , and partially with @xmath13 . because @xmath34 candidates are reconstructed ( not @xmath35 ) , only for @xmath7 and @xmath14 does @xmath36 peak at zero and @xmath37 peak at the physical @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
    "for the other processes , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are offset by a predictable amount . by measuring the yields in each of these kinematically defined regions , one can determine the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fractions at the @xmath2 as well as the contributing subprocesses .",
    "a second approach for obtaining the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields at the @xmath2 is to use inclusive particle yields .",
    "this technique exploits the large difference in inclusive rates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 to various particles , such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "cleo reconstructs @xmath0 mesons via their decays @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( 25 channels in total )  @xcite .",
    "first , the inclusive @xmath0 yield is determined by computing the invariant mass of all @xmath0 meson candidates with @xmath43  mev and @xmath44  mev . unlike @xmath37 , invariant mass",
    "does not depend on the particular @xmath2 decay mode .",
    "a fit to the invariant mass spectrum yields a signal of @xmath45 events . using efficiencies ( @xmath46 ) from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and branching fractions ( @xmath47 ) from the pdg  @xcite , it is found @xmath48 , where the sum is over the 25 decay modes . from this",
    "it is concluded that @xmath49  nb . using this cross - section and the measured total hadronic cross - section , the @xmath1 fraction in @xmath2 decays , @xmath50 ,",
    "is computed to be @xmath51 . to determine the contributing subprocesses ,",
    "events are selected in the expected signal band in the @xmath33 plane and projected onto the @xmath37 axis .",
    "the resulting distribution of events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbc_b ] . a dominant @xmath9 peak is observed , along with a smaller contribution from @xmath8 , and an insignificant yield from @xmath7 .",
    "the distributions are fit to the sum of 3 gaussians , with resolutions determined from mc and the mass difference between the @xmath9 and @xmath7 peaks constrained to the expected value of 47.5  mev .",
    "the fitted yields are @xmath52 @xmath7 , @xmath53 @xmath8 and @xmath54 @xmath9 events .",
    "insignificant yields in @xmath55 and @xmath13 lead to 90% confidence level upper limits of 13.1 and 6.4 events , respectively .",
    "thus , it is found that @xmath56 of the @xmath0 production is through @xmath9 and @xmath57 is from @xmath8 . for @xmath7 , @xmath55 and @xmath13 90% upper limits of 22% , 32% and 14% ,",
    "respectively , are obtained .",
    "these results strongly disfavor the qhm and are consistent with the uqm .",
    "the @xmath37 peak position for @xmath9 and the corresponding peak position from @xmath16  @xcite can be used to make a precise measurement of the @xmath58 mass . noting that @xmath59  mev , and using the well - measured @xmath60 mass  @xcite , gives @xmath61  mev , which provides a significant improvement over the previous measurement .",
    "the m1 mass splitting for @xmath1 is thus found to be @xmath62  mev , which is consistent with the value in the @xmath0 system of @xmath63  mev  @xcite , as expected from heavy quark symmetry .     for @xmath0 signal candidates in cleo .",

    "all 10 signal candidates are @xmath16 .",
    "an additional 4 events are observed in the @xmath66 modes , all of which are also @xmath16 . using efficiencies from simulation and branching fractions from the pdg  @xcite , yields @xmath67 , where @xmath68 neglects the evidently small @xmath14 and @xmath15 contributions .",
    "belle observes a total of 23 events ( 21 @xmath16 , 2 @xmath15 , 0 @xmath14 ) and determines @xmath69 of @xmath1 are from @xmath16  @xcite .     versus @xmath37 ( left ) and @xmath37 ( right ) for @xmath65 candidates in the cleo @xmath2 data sample .",

    "inclusive analyses are senstive to @xmath50 , provided the _ probe _",
    "particle chosen has sufficiently different production rate for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",

    "belle followed up with a similar pair of analyses that use @xmath38 and @xmath39 mesons  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the @xmath1 fraction , @xmath50 , is obtained using an expression of the form :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the number of @xmath2 decays , and we have inserted @xmath38 as the probe particle as an example . here",

    "the measured yields as a function of scaled momentum are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi-5s ] . the first bin @xmath86 is obtained from mc simulation , because in this bin the kaons generally have too low momentum to be reconstructed .",
    "the uncertainty is taken to be 100% of its value . from the measured @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 branching fractions  @xcite , it is deduced that most @xmath40 mesons in @xmath34 decay come from the cascade @xmath90 or @xmath91 , which allows one to make a model - dependent estimate @xmath92 .",

    "[ eq : eq1 ] to obtain @xmath93 .",
    "the combined cleo average , using exclusive @xmath0 mesons , and inclusive @xmath38 and @xmath40 mesons , is @xmath94 .",
    "( filled circles ) and @xmath95 ( triangles ) .",
    "[ fig : phi-5s ] ]    these studies firmly establish the @xmath1 production rate to be about 25% , with roughly 90% of it produced as @xmath96 .",
    "it is also found that @xmath9 is dominant , with @xmath8 about ( 1/3)@xmath9 .",
    "other processes are less than about 25% of @xmath9",
    ". these results are consistent with the uqm , and inconsistent with the qhm .",
    "with a large sample of data collected on the @xmath2 , one can begin to search for rare @xmath1 decays .",
    "while many of the decays can be searched for in @xmath97 ( cdf , d0 ) and @xmath98 ( lhcb at cern , starting 2008 ) , the @xmath3 environment enjoys low particle multiplicity and good signal - to - background for low energy photons .",
    "final states with soft photons are particularly difficult for detectors at hadron machines , and so this is an area where machines operating at the @xmath2 can make significant contributions . taking @xmath99  nb ( 25% of the resonance cross - section ) , a 50  @xmath22 dataset , which could be collected by belle in a couple of months , yields about 7.5 million @xmath1 decays .    in the standard model , the width difference , @xmath100 between the cp eigenstates , @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "is given by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the off - diagonal matrix element in the @xmath1 decay matrix , which connects @xmath1 and @xmath105 via on - shell intermediate states .",
    "these matrix elements are saturated by tree - diagrams , such as @xmath106 , and therefore @xmath107 is expected to be insensitive to new physics . because there are more cp even than cp odd final states in @xmath1 decays , one expects @xmath108@xcite . in the presence of cp violation ,",
    "one finds a width difference between the mass eigenstates of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , is the difference between the @xmath1 mixing phase and the phase of @xmath111 . in the standard model , @xmath40",
    "is expected to be small , of order 0.01 .",
    "therefore , one expects @xmath112 . since new physics could affect @xmath1 mixing , _",
    "i.e. , _ the phase of @xmath113 , new physics could drive @xmath17 away from @xmath100 .",
    "precise measurements of @xmath100 can be obtained by measuring the branching fractions and cp content of final states accessible to @xmath1 and @xmath105 .",
    "such final states are dominated by @xmath114 , but also include @xmath115 , @xmath116 @xmath117 , etc . under certain assumptions  @xcite , it can be shown that @xmath106 is pure cp even , and neglecting the charmonium states , one finds @xmath118 . with a 50  @xmath22 @xmath2 data sample , one would expect @xmath2110 events in each decay mode  @xcite , yielding @xmath2125% accuracy on @xmath119 .",
    "if these assumptions are relaxed , one must measure the cp fraction of the various vector - vector final states , which would require substantially larger statistics .",
    "various rare loop - induced decay modes have been searched for in the belle data sample , including @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath123 , is already more stringent than the current world average .",
    "in summary , we report on measurements of the @xmath1 fraction , @xmath50 at cleo and belle , and find about 25% of the @xmath2 decays produce @xmath1 , predominantly in the form of @xmath16 .",
    "we also find a dominance of @xmath9 among ordinary @xmath0 decays . both of these observations are consistent with the uqm and inconsistent with the qhm .",
