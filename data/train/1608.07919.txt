    "the emission spectra of helium - like ( he - like ) and lithium - like ( li - like ) ions have been observed in recent years both in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas .",
    "the x - ray spectra from these ions are observed from a large variety of astrophysical sources @xcite and laser plasma interactions @xcite .",
    "they are used to determine the primordial abundances of elements that are of immense interest for testing the big bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "detection of these lines using astronomy telescopes reveal many x - ray sources . also , the earth s atmosphere absorbs most of the radiation at the x - ray wavelengths , so its behavior and dynamics can be investigated by knowing these lines accurately .",
    "accurate determination of these lines have become very demanding in recent years with the advent of increasingly powerful x - ray satellite telescopes .",
    "the two most powerful telescopes to date are the chandra x - ray observatory , launched by nasa , in 1999 @xcite , and the x - ray multi - mirror ( xmm ) newton telescope , launched by the european space agency , recently @xcite .",
    "the astrosat satellite , launched last year by indian space research organization ( isro ) is also aiming at exploring the possible x - ray sources in the space @xcite .",
    "the international x - ray observatory is being planned to be launched in 2021 jointly by nasa , european space agency ( esa ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) which can cover a large effective area to probe for the x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "this is why x - ray astronomy remains to be an active research area today .",
    "due to high spectral resolution and sensitivity of the current generation x - ray satellites chandra and xmm - newton , it is possible to resolve the he - like ion lines distinctly and use them in the diagnostics for extra - solar objects .",
    "indeed , the he - like ion line ratios are valuable tools in the analysis of high - resolution spectra of a variety of plasmas such as collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) plasmas or also called coronal plasmas @xcite . in such plasmas , ionization occurs due to electron - ion collision processes and the atomic levels are populated mainly by the electron impact .",
    "it is commonly assumed that cie plasmas are optically thin to their own radiation , and there is no external radiation field that affects the ionization balance .",
    "however , in some cases , these assumptions are not fulfilled . in this case ,",
    "recombination - dominated or photo - ionization equilibrium ( pie ) plasmas play the important role @xcite , where ionization takes place due to photons ( ionizing radiation ) . as a result",
    ", the atomic levels are populated mainly by the radiative recombination processes directly or by cascading from the upper levels .",
    "these plasma are generally over ionized relative to the local electronic temperature and have a much smaller electronic temperature compared to cie plasmas .",
    "that is why collisional excitations out of the ground state are inefficient and the excited levels are populated via the radiative recombination processes .",
    "accurate knowledge of spectral lines of plasma embedded ions have become increasingly important today due to their observations using the high resolution detectors of the space - based x - ray observatories .",
    "especially , the highly forbidden `` triplet '' inter - combination , and resonance lines of the he - like and li - like ions have been used to measure temperature and density of ions and electrons in the solar corona @xcite . compared to other ionic iso - electronic sequences , he - like ions are abundant over the widest temperature range in collisional plasmas due to their closed - shell ground state @xcite .",
    "the most intense he - like lines correspond to transitions between the @xmath2 shell and the @xmath3 ground state shell @xcite , where @xmath0 is the principal quantum number .",
    "these he - like lines were first observed in laboratory for c , f , mg , al ( see @xcite ) and later in solar plasmas by the orbiting solar observatory ( oso ) @xcite and rocket experiments @xcite .",
    "gabriel and jordan had argued for use of a suitable theoretical many - body method for the identification of the wavelength of the transition from the metastable @xmath4 level to the ground level @xcite and later griem had demonstrated it using the quantum - relativistic calculation @xcite . since the pioneering work of gabriel and jordan @xcite , several works have been dedicated to the improvements of these diagnostics based on spectral lines of the he - like ions and their extension to other types of plasmas ( pie and non - ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "gabriel and jordan had also proposed that the relative intensities of these lines can be used for temperature and density diagnostics for solar plasma @xcite , which have been widely used for solar spectra @xcite and for x - ray spectra of tokamak plasmas @xcite .",
    "some astrophysical plasmas , such as supernova remnants , solar and stellar flares , colliding winds in star clusters and x - ray binaries , cluster of galaxies , intra - cluster medium in merging galaxy clusters , etc .",
    ", depart from the ionization equilibrium when one or several physical conditions like temperature , electron or ion density and photo - ionization radiation field of the plasma suddenly change .    the absorption lines of li - like ions occur close to the emission lines of the triplets of their corresponding he - like ions",
    ". the absorption lines of these ions can , therefore , affect the intensity of the triplet lines .",
    "in particular , those of the inter - combination lines as shown in the present study . without taking into account in the analysis the absorption lines of the li - like ions intrinsic to a medium emitting lines close to wavelengths of the triplets in the he - like ions , it can mislead to wrong plasma diagnostics @xcite .",
    "transition lines from li - like fe are quite useful for plasma diagnostics @xcite .",
    "recent laboratory studies have shown that the intensity of the 3d-4f and 3d-5f lines in the li - like ions increase exponentially with debye length in experiments conducted using very low power laser pulses @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we would like to focus on investigating transition lines in the he - like and li - like mg and fe ions in the plasma environment with ion and electron densities of the order of @xmath5 @xmath6 and for the temperature range 0 to 150 ev .",
    "some of these transitions were experimentally verified in a recent work @xcite , but we shall provide these spectra for a large number of transitions which are mostly lying in the x - range regime . the paper is organized as follows : in secs .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the screening models that are considered in the calculations for the description of the atomic spectra and sec .",

    "[ sec4 ] , we present the results , compare with the other studies and discuss them before summarizing the work in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . unless stated otherwise we have used atomic units ( a.u . ) through out of this paper .",
    "the plasma environment mostly consists of ions and free electrons , which introduce screening effects in the coulomb potentials of the embedded atomic systems . as a result ,",
    "the atomic electrons are highly influenced by the external electromagnetic fields compelling the atomic long range electrostatic potentials to act as short range screened potentials .",
    "for the theoretical study of the spectroscopy of a plasma embedded atomic system , the screening effects due to the plasma can be conveniently accounted for , in such a scenario , by defining suitable model potentials in the atomic hamiltonian for the corresponding strength of the plasma .",
    "the strength of the plasma is defined by a coupling parameter ( @xmath7 ) that measures the interactions between the particles inside the plasma environment .",
    "debye model @xcite is the most conventional approach used for studying atomic spectroscopy in low electron - density and high temperature plasma ( weakly coupled plasma ; i.e @xmath7 @xmath8 1 ) .",
    "the phenomenon of reduction of ionization potential ( ip ) of an atom or an ion in the plasma environment is known as ionization potential depression ( ipd ) @xcite .",
    "accurate determination of this quantity can infer many useful information such as providing right equation of state of plasma , estimating radiative opacity of stellar plasma and inertial confinement fusion plasma , etc . in most of the previous studies ,",
    "the electronic structures of the plasma embedded atomic systems have been investigated using non - relativistic many - body methods . in this work ,",
    "we consider the dirac - coulomb ( dc ) hamiltonian in the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method , which is explained in the next section , to calculate wave functions of the atomic states .",
    "moreover , in most of the previous works the screening effects were taken into account only through the nuclear potential .",
    "we , however , incorporate screening effects through both the nuclear and electron - electron interactions for more accurate description .",
    "its importance was demonstrated recently in a number of works @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "the two - body screening potential is expressed in terms of multiple expansion form and the reduced matrix elements are used for economical computation as described in the subsequent section .    in the weakly coupled plasma , the screening effects seen by an electron located at @xmath9 in an atomic system due to the presence of other free electrons inside the plasma",
    "is accounted by an effective potential given as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the usual nuclear potential of electron in the plasma free atomic system and is estimated by consider the fermi nuclear charge distribution and @xmath12 is the potential due to the two - body coulomb interactions among the electrons with the debye screening length @xmath13 .",

    "eas of li - like mg and fe ions are also determined by extending calculations of their he - like ions . in order to validate our calculations ,",

    "most of nist data are obtained from high precision calculations using more accurate numerical methods that take into account the contributions from quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) rigorously .",
    "ips of plasma free he i , mg xi and fe xxv systems are presented in table [ tab1 ] along with the nist data .",
    "our calculations also agree well with the nist data and they are found to be sub - one percent accurate .",
    "discrepancies in the he - i system are mainly due to poor description of nuclear charge distribution , while they are mainly due to the neglected qed corrections in the other ions .",
