    "the astrophysical observations of supernovae of type ia give a convincing evidence of a universe undergoing an accelerated phase of its expansion history ; rather than going to deceleration as was expected theoretically @xcite .",
    "similar conclusion has been deduced from the observations of anisotropies in cosmic microwave background by the wmap @xcite which favors a low density , spatially flat ( @xmath4 ) universe filled with an exotic vacuum energy containing the maximum portion of the total energy density , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this mysterious dark energy is represented by a barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the pressure and the energy density of dark energy , with @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath3 , it is called ` cosmological constant ' , @xmath10 is dubbed ` quintessence ' , while it is called ` phantom energy ' if @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "all these candidates have some fundamental problems : the former one presents discrepancy of @xmath12 orders of magnitude between theoretical and empirical results @xcite , while quintessence requires fine tuning of cosmological parameters for a suitable choice of the potential function @xcite . also the phantom energy yields eccentric predictions like ` big rip ' and ripping apart of gravitationally bound objects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the variations in @xmath13 suggest that there is no consensus on the actual eos of dark energy and one can only deal with the upper and lower bounds on @xmath13 @xcite .    although the dark energy is generically considered to be a perfect fluid yet it need not to be perfect if it experiences perturbations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dark energy also may not be completely ` dark ' especially if it gets coupled with matter and energy exchange takes place ; consequently the matter evolution becomes modified @xcite .",
    "it is now obvious that this sudden transition to acceleration from the earlier deceleration phase is rather recent with the corresponding redshift @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the standard model of cosmology may not be sufficient to explain this exotic phenomenon and hence significant modifications are proposed like a modified friedmann equation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an arbitrary function of @xmath8 and @xmath17 is the hubble parameter @xcite and adding a cardassian term in the friedmann equation @xcite .",
    "other possible explanations proposed are dark energy arising from tachyonic matter @xcite , van der waals fluid @xcite , geometric dark energy @xcite , dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) gravity model @xcite and randall - sundrum brane world model @xcite are most prominent .",
    "although the nature of dark energy is not clear but its thermodynamical properties suggest a universe filled with it becomes hotter with time @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting problems in the present cosmology is the cosmic coincidence ( or cosmic conundrum ) problem which naively asks : why the energy densities of matter and dark energy are of the same order or the corresponding dimensionless ratio is closer to 1 , at current time @xcite .",
    "this problem can be posed in terms of the eos parameter @xmath13 : if the parameter @xmath18 in the past and @xmath11 in the future then why we are observing @xmath3 at present time . in recent years , this problem is addressed using a notion of interacting dark energy model in which both the interacting components i.e. dark energy and matter exchange energy to keep the density ratio close to 1 .",
    "this model has some intrinsic problems that are still unresolved : the microphysics of energy transfer is not exactly understood i.e. the particles that can mediate the interaction are not pointed out .",
    "moreover , the coupling function ( or the decay rate ) for the required interaction is chosen quite arbitrarily @xcite and also the coupling constant involved is not yet properly constrained theoretically or observationally @xcite . in this paper , we address this problem using a simplified approach by considering the constants of physics to evolve over cosmic time .",
    "we here take three ansatz for scale factor and analyze the behavior of parameter @xmath13 .",
    "curiously , the parameter @xmath19 evolves from positive to negative values and finally converges to @xmath20 .",
    "this result turns out to be consistent with the observations .",
    "hence our model fairly addresses the cosmic coincidence problem and practically alleviates it .",
    "due to multitude of uncertainties in the determination of @xmath13 observationally and other intrinsic theoretical problems ( as discussed above ) with it , we here proceed with an eos commonly called the chaplygin gas ( cg ) represented by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant parameter .",
    "the cg effectively explains the evolution of the universe from the earlier deceleration ( matter dominated era ) to the later acceleration phase ( dark energy dominated ) as is manifested in the following equation @xmath23 here @xmath24 is a constant of integration parameter . for small @xmath25 ,",
    "it gives @xmath26 while for large @xmath25 , we have @xmath27 .",
    "therefore models based on cg are also called dark energy - matter unification models @xcite . due to its this effectiveness ,",
    "several generalizations of cg are proposed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the chaplygin gas arises from the dynamics of a generalized @xmath28-brane in a ( @xmath29 ) spacetime and can be described by a complex scalar field whose action can be written as a generalized born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the second section , we shall present the model of our system . in third section ,",
    "we determine the cosmological parameters for different choices of the scale factor parameter .",
    "the last section is devoted for the conclusion of our paper .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric which satisfies the cosmological principle is specified by @xmath30.\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the scale factor that determines the expansion of the universe . also the parameter @xmath32 is the curvature parameter determining the spatial geometry of the frw spacetime . it can take three possible values @xmath33 which correspond to spatially closed , flat and open universe respectively or geometrically spherical , minkowskian and hyperbolic spacetime respectively .",
    "the equations of motion corresponding to frw metric are @xmath34 above @xmath17 is the hubble parameter .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath35 in the above equations which is favored by the observational data . here",
    "@xmath0 is called the cosmological constant with dimensions of @xmath36 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 5 ) shows that accelerated expansion of the universe @xmath37 is possible if the strong energy condition @xmath38 is violated and also it is independent of the choice of @xmath32 .",
    "the energy conservation equation for the above system is @xmath39 the cherished constants of physics that describe the universe need not to be constant but can vary with respect to other parameters .",
    "for instance , the cosmological constant @xmath40 which is constant at zeroth order approximation but is really a time dependent function at higher order approximations .",
    "note that accelerated expansion of the universe follows from @xmath41 .",
    "the cosmic history of @xmath0 shows that it was large in the past while it is small at present and will continue to decrease , hence it gives a parametrization @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "a variable cosmological constant also arises in theories of higher spatial dimensions like string theory and manifests itself as the energy density for the vacuum @xcite and it can also addresses the cosmic age problem effectively @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is some evidence of a varying newton s constant @xmath1 : observations of hulse - taylor binary pulsar b@xmath45 gives a following estimate @xmath46 @xcite , helioseismological data gives the bound @xmath47 @xcite ( see ref @xcite for various bounds on @xmath48 from observational data ) . the variability in @xmath1 results in the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "dimensional analysis also shows that the time dependent parameter @xmath0 to be decreasing with time @xmath49 @xcite . in another approach",
    ", it is shown that @xmath1 can be oscillatory with time @xcite .",
    "it is recently proposed that variable cosmic constants are coupled to each other i.e. variation in one leads to changes in others @xcite .",
    "a variable gravitational constant also explains the dark matter problem as well @xcite .",
    "also discrepancies in the value of hubble parameter can be removed with the consideration of variable @xmath1 @xcite . due to these reasons",
    ", we shall take @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be time dependent quantities i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "hence eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) yield @xmath52 using eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we can write @xmath53 taking the ansatz for cosmological constant as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constant parameters .",
    "note that this is a general ansatz and can reduce to chakraborty and debnath @xcite if @xmath57 .",
    "using the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) eos given by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constant parameters and @xmath61 .",
    "thermodynamical analysis of mcg show that the values @xmath62 and @xmath63 are consistent with the phenomenological results @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the recent supernovae data favors @xmath64 values @xcite .",
    "the mcg reduces to generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) if @xmath65 while it gives cg if further @xmath66 . while a barotropic eos is obtained if @xmath67 .",

    "precisely , the observations of cosmic microwave background gives the constraint @xmath68 at @xmath69 confidence level @xcite .",
