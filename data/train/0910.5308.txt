    "all curves coincide , while for longer times the correlations decrease much slower at the chain s center compared to the terminal where the correlation time ( defined in the sense , that the correlation function is markedly different from zero ) is also larger than for the dimer . thus the correlation time",

    "@xmath95 is about @xmath96 larger than @xmath97 ) and becomes even larger in longer chains .",

    "<S> in what follows we discuss the thermally activated breakdown within a model which assumes that the dynamics of the chain is a rouse one @xcite ( as long as it does nt break ) , i.e. we disregard excluded volume effects , which is a reasonable assumption in the case of tagged chains in melts and concentrated solutions , as well as hydrodynamical interactions . </S>",

    "<S> the possibility of reestablishing the bond after breakdown ( defect healing ) is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the relevant situations of free and grafted chains .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermally activated bond breakdown is essentially an example of an intrachain chemical reaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrary to e.g. polymer cyclization @xcite which was considered in quite a detail , this one was hardly tackled . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption that the bond breaks when achieving the given elongation simplifies the description , and corresponds to assuming the corresponding reaction to be purely diffusion - controlled reaction on a contact . </S>",

    "<S> the first passage times are substantially lower compared to bonds in the middle of the chain ( for a free chain ) or at its grafted end ( for a grafted one ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the thermally activated fragmentation is expected to happen mostly at the chain ends . </S>",
