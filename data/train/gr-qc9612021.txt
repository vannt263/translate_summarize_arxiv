    "our analysis of the canonical action ( i ) provides a rigorous correspondence between the most general 2d einstein - cartan model ( ecm ) and gdt and ( ii ) allows us to extract in a virtually simultaneous manner the true degrees of freedom for both the ( vacuum ) ecms and gdts we study . for all such models ,",

    "via an integration by parts we can replace the term @xmath37 in the volume integral with @xmath38 , along the way generating a boundary term which exactly cancels the one that we have included .",
    "next , @xmath39 is a ( possibly dimensionful ) constant which allows us to easily compare our results with standard ones for ssgr and 2ddg . finally , the potential term is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant with units of inverse length and @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the `` target - space coordinates''@xcite @xmath44 have transparent geometric meanings .",
    "the special case of ssgr suggests that we may interpret @xmath28 as essentially the squared areal radius .",
    "moreover , for ssgr the @xmath45 turn out to be ( apart from @xmath28-dependent factors ) the expansions associated with the null zweibein .",
    "in addition to this special - case interpretation , the fields @xmath45 are also closely related to the spacetime torsion when torsion is present ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "indeed , among the euler - lagrange equations of motion ( eoms ) associated with ( [ psmaction ] ) is the following : @xmath47 therefore , one finds that @xmath48 is the hodge dual of the torsion @xmath49-form .      in the absence of matter the eoms associated with the ecm action ( [ psmaction ] ) can be solved exactly for integrable @xmath50 and @xmath51@xcite . in this paper , ( [ psmaction ] )",
    "( possibly also with matter ) and its associated eoms dictate the spacetime geometries we study , in particular determining ( what we call ) the _ unphysical _ metric @xmath6 .",
    "however , we have reason to be interested in certain _ physical _ metrics @xmath52 which arise from the unphysical metrics @xmath6 via conformal transformation .",

    "now , in fact , both ssgr and 2ddg are special cases of gdt .",
    "therefore , the conformal transformations we consider now are essential , if we intend to apply our methods to ( at least arguably ) the most interesting 2d models . for example",
    ", we shall write down a ecm action corresponding to vacuum ssgr . however , in this case it is the rescaled metric @xmath52 rather than the metric @xmath6 ( determined directly by this particular ecm action s eoms ) which matches the familiar time - radial piece of the 4d sbh line - element@xcite .",
    "our conformal transformations are given by the following set of field re - definitions in the action ( using abstract notation ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is at this point an arbitrary function of @xmath28 and the `` @xmath55 '' represents the hodge - duality associated with physical metric @xmath52 .",
    "the transformation ( [ conformal ] ) has been tailored to ensure that @xmath56 is a consistent behavior for the torsion tensor under the transformation . under the conformal transformation ( [ conformal ] ) ,",

    "the boundary term that we have included in ( [ psmaction ] ) ensures that the variational principle associated with the rescaled action ( [ hatpsmaction ] ) features fixation of the same boundary data as fixed in the original variational principle . in the variational principle associated with ( [ psmaction ] ) @xmath5 and @xmath28 ( and matter )",

    "preservation of the boundary conditions under the conformal rescaling is the main motivation for including this boundary term , although this requirement alone does not uniquely determine the choice of boundary term .- dimensional dilaton theories.@xcite in @xmath2 v we comment further on the relationship between the terms we consider and those found in that reference . ] indeed , in @xmath2 v we shall add further boundary terms to the action which are insensitive to the conformal transformation .",
    "the form ( [ hatpsmaction ] ) of the conformally rescaled action affords a rather direct comparison with the second - order action associated with a gdt . for simplicity here",
    "only , we restrict ourselves to vanishing torsion . indeed , with @xmath61 ( no torsion ) ,",
    "elimination of the fields @xmath62 via their algebraic eoms casts ( [ hatpsmaction ] ) into the following form : @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\kappa \\oint_{\\partial{\\cal m}}{\\rm d}x     \\sqrt{|\\tilde{g}^{1}| }     x \\tilde{\\epsilon}^{\\mu\\nu }    \\tilde{\\omega}_{\\mu}\\tilde{\\sf n}_{\\nu } + l^{(m ) } { \\ , } , \\label{hatdilatonaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have switched to index notation , @xmath64 is the ricci scalar of @xmath52 , and @xmath65 is the determinant of the induced metric on @xmath4 ( the absolute value sign is needed to handle timelike elements of @xmath4 ) .",
    "further , @xmath66 is the @xmath31-form dual ( in the metric @xmath52 ) to the outward - pointing unit - normal vector field of the boundary @xmath4 as embedded in @xmath3 ( @xmath67 differs from the unit normal by a sign on a spacelike element of @xmath4 ) .",
    "we note that , in general , the boundary term in ( [ hatdilatonaction ] ) can not be expressed purely in terms of the metric @xmath52 ( rather , it is at heart a zweibein expression ) .",
    "therefore , as gdts are , strictly speaking , metric theories , the action above is not quite appropriate to describe a gdt . we shall improve upon this situation in @xmath2 v , where we begin with the addition of a boundary term to the ecm action which is zweibein - gauge invariant ( in a sense to be made precise below ) .",
    "let us quickly consider the special case of vacuum ssgr , as it will determine some of our conventions",
    ". set @xmath68 and make the following substitutions in ( [ hatdilatonaction ] ) : @xmath69 finally , set @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the round @xmath49-sphere areal radius ( or luminosity parameter ) . notice that @xmath28 is restricted to positive values .",
    "the minus sign in ( [ ssgrchoices]b ) cancels one in ( [ hatdilatonaction ] ) .",
    "we have introduced this spurious minus sign only to ensure that our conventions are more in harmony with those of refs .",
    "@xcite ( although those references do adopt a different metric - signature convention ) .",
    "the result of these substitutions is an action which ( as was first noted by thomi , isaak , and hjek@xcite ) has as its associated eoms the 4d einstein equations subject to the ansatz of spherical symmetry .",
    "in addition , the resulting action can ( apart from certain technical points concerning the zweibein dependence of the boundary term ) be obtained directly form the 4d einstein - hilbert action via a reduction by spherical symmetry ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the choices ( [ ssgrchoices ] )",
    "ensures that the adm mass as measured at spatial infinity corresponds to the sbh mass parameter .",
    "moreover , the choice ( [ ssgrchoices]a ) gives the action the units of action in 4d .",
    "ssgr is an example of the `` physical '' situation that we are interested in .",
    "namely , we shall require that a flat line - element ( `` minkowski groundstate '' ) is obtained when the mass parameter of the solution is set to zero .",
    "we consider the most general class of such models in @xmath2 iv .",
    "it should be emphasized that the conformal transformations used in this paper leave minimal interactions with a scalar field invariant .",
    "a minimally coupled fermion transforms covariantly .",
    "we stress that we do _ not _ examine in detail the eoms associated with the action ( [ hatdilatonaction ] ) , or , for that matter , those associated with the action ( [ hatpsmaction ] ) . indeed , since these eoms are considerably more complicated than those associated with ( [ psmaction ] ) , it is prudent to work directly at the level of the ecm action ( [ psmaction ] ) with its relatively simple first - order eoms ; switching via conformal transformation to the hatted variables of real interest only `` at the end of the day . ''",
    "the merit of this approach is strikingly evident in the transparent derivation of the conservation law ( always present for the 2d theories we study here)@xcite .",
    "indeed , a simple linear combination of the eoms obtained by varying the ecm action ( [ psmaction ] ) with respect to the zweibein and spin connection yields the promised conservation law , namely , @xmath72",

    "now , to make ( [ conservation ] ) look like a conservation law , we appeal to the poincar - lemma which tells us that that @xmath76 ( at least locally ) , with @xmath77 a field - nonlocal expression built from the ( geometric variables and ) matter fields . that @xmath75 is locally exact must also follow via a clever combination of the remaining ( notably matter ) eoms",
    "therefore , we have found @xmath78 = { \\rm d}[x^{+}x^{- }    \\exp(\\alpha x ) + w + c^{(m ) } ] = 0 \\label{conservation2}\\ ] ] for the conservation law valid for _ all _ ecms in 2d.@xcite it is , of course , trivial to rewrite @xmath0 in terms of the physical variables . for the case of vacuum ssgr we shall see that @xmath79 ( mass dimension @xmath31 in 4d ) corresponds to the mass parameter of the sbh .",

    "an expression for the rest - frame energy , and for this goal the above possibility ( i ) suffices .",
    "therefore , for the rest of the paper , we shall assume that the patch @xmath3 lies entirely within a single static region ( which for the sake of definiteness we take to be a type i region ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath481 describes the boost between the boundary @xmath173 and killing @xmath147 frames .",

    "our main results in this paper concern the important role played by boundary conditions in the passage -via conformal transformation- between einstein - cartan models ( ecms , described by a first - order zweibein action ) and generalized dilaton theories ( gdts , described by a metric action ) .",

    "as shown in @xmath2 i , if the intent is to perform such a conformal re - definition of field variables in the first - order action for an ecm , then a boundary term must be included in the definition of the action , or else the action s associated variational principle is not preserved under the the conformal transformation .",
    "moreover , while at first sight it appears that the addition of such a boundary term destroys the zweibein gauge - invariance of the theory at the boundary @xmath82 of the spacetime patch @xmath3 , we have explicitly demonstrated in @xmath2 v that this need not be true .",
    "it is quite notable that by imposing the dual requirements of ( i ) conformally preserved boundary conditions and ( ii ) complete zweibein - gauge invariance , we have arrived at set of canonical variables , namely , the @xmath84-adapted canonical variables ( @xmath84cvs ) ( [ sigmavariables ] ) , which appear to be new in the literature .",
    "although strictly zweibein variables , the @xmath84cvs are intimately related to the standard canonical adm metric variables , and therefore , they particularly elucidate the relationship between zweibein ecms and metric gdts .",

    "besides being of interest in its own right , the canonical quasilocal energy - momentum ( here derived via a hamilton - jacobi - type argument due to brown and york@xcite ) serves as a stepping stone for introducing the rapidity in @xmath2 v.b , thus leading to the rapidity canonical variables ( rcvs ) in @xmath2 vi.b . with the @xmath84cvs and rcvs in mind ,",

    "@xcite should be consulted .",
    "second , we have bypassed the stubborn problem of either ( i ) finding good canonical variables which do not break down on horizons or , at the very least , ( ii ) developing a precise understanding of how to use known `` target - space '' canonical variables ( such as our rcvs ) when a spacelike slice cuts completely across a horizon in a general way . as mentioned , for ssgr",
