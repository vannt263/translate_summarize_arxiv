    "the buckling of rods , shells and plates is traditionally described in mechanics textbooks as an instability in the framework of nonlinear shell theory obtained by semi - rigorous dimension reduction of three - dimensional nonlinear elasticity . while these theories are effective in describing large deformations of rods and shells ( including buckling ) , their heuristic nature obscures the source of the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results , as is the case for axially compressed circular cylindrical shells @xcite . at the same time",
    ", a rigorously derived theory of bending of shells @xcite captures deformations in the vicinity of relatively smooth isometries of the middle surface .",
    "unfortunately , the isometries of the straight circular cylinder are non - smooth @xcite .",
    "our approach , originating in @xcite , is capable of giving a mathematically rigorous treatment of buckling of slender bodies and determining whether the tacit assumptions of the classical derivation are the source of the discrepancy with experiment . in this paper",
    ", we apply our theory and obtain a mathematically rigorous proof of the classical formula for buckling load @xcite .",
    "this result justifies the generally accepted assumption that the paradoxical behavior of cylindrical shells in buckling is due to the high sensitivity of the buckling load to imperfections @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is commonly explained by the instability of equilibrium states in the vicinity of the buckling point on the bifurcation diagram @xcite .",
    "however , the exact mechanisms of imperfection sensitivity are not fully understood , nor is there a reliable theory capable of predicting experimentally observed buckling loads @xcite .",
    "while a full bifurcation analysis is necessary to understand the stability of equilibria near the critical point , our method s singular focus on the stability of the trivial branch gives access to the scaling behavior of key measures of structural stability in the thin shell limit .",
    "we have argued in @xcite that axially compressed circular cylindrical shells are susceptible to scaling instability of the critical load , whereby the scaling exponent , and not just its coefficient , can be affected by imperfections .",
    "the new analytical tools developed in @xcite give hope for a path towards quantification of imperfection sensitivity .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that the pre - buckled state is governed by equations of linear elasticity @xcite . at the critical load ,",
    "the linear elastic stress reaches a level at which the trivial branch becomes unstable within the framework of 3d hyperelasticity .",
    "the origin of this instability is completely geometric : the frame - indifference of the energy density function implies non - convexity in the compressive strain region . since buckling occurs at relatively small compressive loads , the material s stress - strain response is locally linear .",
    "this explains why all classical formulas for buckling loads of various slender structures involve only linear elastic moduli and hold regardless of the material response model .",
    "the significance of our approach is two - fold .",
    "first , it provides a common platform to study buckling of arbitrary slender bodies .",
    "second , its conclusions are mathematically rigorous and its underlying assumptions explicitly specified . the goal of this paper is to demonstrate the power and flexibility of our method on the non - trivial , yet analytically solvable example of the axially compressed circular cylindrical shell .",
    "our analysis is powered by asymptotically sharp korn - like inequalities @xcite , where instead of bounding the @xmath0 norm of the displacement gradient by the @xmath0 norm of the strain tensor , we bound the @xmath0 norm of individual components of the gradient by the @xmath0 norm of the strain tensor .",
    "these inequalities have been derived in our companion paper @xcite .",
    "the method of buckling equivalence @xcite provides flexibility by furnishing a systematic way of discarding asymptotically insignificant terms , while simplifying the variational functionals that characterize buckling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : genth ] , we describe the loading and corresponding trivial branch of an axially compressed cylindrical shell treated as 3-dimensional hyperelastic body .",
    "we define stability of the trivial branch in terms of the second variation of energy .",
    "next , we describe our approach from @xcite and recall all necessary technical results from @xcite for the sake of completeness . in section  [ sec : perfect ] , we give the rigorous derivation of the classical buckling load and identify the explicit form of buckling modes .",
    "our two most delicate results are a rigorous proof of the existence of a buckling mode that is a single fourier harmonic and the linearization of the dependence of this buckling mode on the radial variable  the two assumptions that are commonly made in the classical derivation of the critical load formula .",
    "[ sec : genth ] in this section we will give a mathematical formulation of the problem of buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shell .",

    "while this is not needed for general theory , in this paper we will also assume that @xmath17 is isotropic : @xmath27 this assumption is necessary to obtain an explicit formula for the critical load .",
    "our goal is to examine stability of the homogeneous trivial branch @xmath12 given in cylindrical coordinates by @xmath28 where the function @xmath29 is determined by the natural boundary conditions @xmath30 since uniform deformations always satisfy equations of equilibrium .",

    "the function @xmath37 is three times continuously differentiable in a neighborhood  of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 the isotropy ( [ wiso ] ) implies that @xmath40 for all @xmath21 .",
    "differentiating this relation in @xmath41 at @xmath42 we conclude that @xmath43 must commute with @xmath44 .",
