    "the spectroscopy of simple atomic systems like hydrogen @xcite , hydrogenic ions @xcite , muonic hydrogen @xcite , muonium , positronium has been used to determine fundamental physical constants and to test the quantum electrodynamic theory . although experiments for more complicated atomic systems like helium or lithium can be as accurate as for hydrogen , the precision of theoretical predictions , at the moment , is not sufficient to determine physical constants , such as the fine structure constant @xmath2 , the rydberg constant ( ry ) , or the absolute value of the nuclear charge radius .",
    "in contrast , the hydrogen molecule , thanks to its simplicity , has already been used for the most accurate determination of the deuteron magnetic moment from nmr measurements @xcite , and for the studies of the unknown hypothetical fifth force at the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "the precision achieved recently for transition frequencies , of an order of @xmath3 , has been verified by a series of measurements , which resulted in strong bounds on the fifth force .",
    "we will argue in this work , that it is possible to achieve @xmath4 accuracy for energy levels of the hydrogen molecule , which not only will improve tests of quantum electrodynamics theory and will put stronger bounds on the fifth force , but also will allow a resolution of the proton charge radius puzzle , which stands as a violation of the standard model of fundamental interactions @xcite .",
    "the improvement in theoretical predictions for the hydrogen molecule can be achieved by the calculation of the yet unknown higher order @xmath5ry quantum electrodynamics correction and by a more accurate solution of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "this second improvement is performed in this work , while the calculation of the qed effects is in progress .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation  for the hydrogen molecule has been pursued since almost the beginning of the quantum mechanics theory . over time",
    ", there have been many contributions to the development of methods with increased precision of theoretical predictions .",
    "heitler and london @xcite , james and coolidge @xcite , koos and wolniewicz @xcite , and many others have made their marks on the history of research on h@xmath0 .",
    "every breakthrough in the precision of theoretical predictions has been related to the progress in computational techniques .",
    "[ fig ] illustrates the progress made over many decades in the precision of the dissociation energy @xmath6 for h@xmath0 .     of h@xmath0 versus time , with the linear fit on the logarithmic scale .",
    "]    not always the results of calculations have been in agreement with measured values , which has questioned the validity of the theoretical approach .",
    "for example , in 1964 koos and wolniewicz @xcite solved variationally the nonadiabatic schrdinger equation  for the hydrogen molecule .",
    "the calculated dissociation energy appeared to be higher than the measured one @xcite , which was in contradiction with the variational principle .",
    "five years later , herzberg measured @xmath6 again with the accuracy increased to a few tenths of reciprocal centimeter and obtained a value higher than previously by @xmath7 in agreement with the koos and wolniewicz predictions .",
    "further progress in theoretical predictions was related to the calculations of the leading relativistic corrections and to approximate qed effects @xcite .",
    "later on , due to rapid development of computer power , the methods based on exponentially correlated gaussian ( ecg ) functions have been developed both in the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite and in the direct nonadiabatic approach @xcite .",
    "very recently , we have introduced a nonadiabatic perturbation theory ( napt ) , which allowed the accuracy of about @xmath8 to be achieved for all the rovibrational levels of h@xmath0 and isotopomers @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of napt in the higher order of electron - nucleus mass ratio @xcite makes further improvements in accuracy quite complicated . for this reason",
    ", we propose another approach to the direct solution of the schrdinger equation  by the use of the special integration technique for explicitly correlated exponential functions and present its first results in this letter . over fifty years after koos and wolniewicz",
    ", we approach the problem of solving the four - body schrdinger equation , with the precision aim for @xmath6 at the level of @xmath9 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to solve accurately the stationary schrdinger equation  @xmath10 for a diatomic molecule with the nuclei of charge @xmath11 and @xmath12 and finite masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 using the variational approach . the trial wave function @xmath16 is expanded in properly symmetrized ( @xmath17 ) , four - particle basis of exponential functions @xmath18 } r_{ab}^{k_0}\\,{r_{12}}^{k_1}\\,\\eta_1^{k_2}\\,\\eta_2^{k_3}\\,\\zeta_1^{k_4}\\,\\zeta_2^{k_5}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are coordinates closely related to the prolate spheroidal coordinates of @xmath21-th electron , @xmath22 are interparticle distances , @xmath2 and @xmath23 are nonlinear variational parameters , and @xmath24 are non - negative integers collectively denoted as @xmath25 . for its resemblance to the electronic james - coolidge function , we call this basis function _ the nonadiabatic james - coolidge _ ( najc ) function",
    ".    application of the najc function for evaluation of the matrix elements leads to a certain class of integrals .",
    "efficient evaluation of these integrals has become feasible since the discovery of the analytic formulas @xcite and the corresponding recursive relations @xcite .",
    "for example , the master integral , which is the starting point for the recursions , can be expressed in the following form @xmath26\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integrals with additional positive powers of interparticle distances are obtained by straightforward algebraic recursion relations , which nevertheless are two long to be written explicitly here . all of them can be derived from a single fourth - order differential equation @xcite , which is satisfied by the general four - body integral , and are expressed in terms of logarithmic and rational functions .",
    "details of this recursion method will be described elsewhere .",
    "results of our calculations for h@xmath0 are presented in tab .",
    "[ tconv ] in the form a sequence of energies resulting from increasing length ( @xmath27 ) of expansion  ( [ expand ] ) .",
    "the selection of @xmath27 was made on the basis of the saturation of consecutive shells limited by @xmath28 with @xmath29 fixed at 30 .",
    "the observed regular convergence , obeying the inverse power low , permits a firm extrapolation to the complete basis set as well as an estimation of the uncertainty .",
    "the final value agrees well with the previous estimation of @xmath30 a.u .",
    "obtained by bubin et al .",
    "@xcite but has a significantly smaller uncertainty .",
    "c@  @rw4.17w7.12 @xmath31 & @xmath32 & & +   + 10 & 36642 & -1.1640250308214 & 36118.79773257 + 11 & 53599 & -1.1640250308709 & 36118.79774343 + 12 & 76601 & -1.1640250308804 & 36118.79774552 + 13 & 106764 & -1.1640250308825 & 36118.79774597 + @xmath33 & @xmath33 & -1.164025030884(1 ) &",
    "36118.7977463(2 ) +    further increase in the accuracy of eigenvalue of the four - body schrdinger equation  is feasible , but the problem we face is the lack of the parallel code in multiprecision arithmetics for the @xmath34 matrix decomposition with pivoting , which results in a long computation time . however , current uncertainties in the electron - proton ( proton - deuteron ) mass ratio and in the rydberg constant are much more significant than those due to numerical uncertainties .",
    "for example , the codata 2014 @xcite electron - proton mass ratio has a relative uncertainty of @xmath35 , which affects the eigenvalue of h@xmath0 at the level of @xmath36 a.u . and the corresponding dissociation energy at @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , the current uncertainty in the rydberg constant affects the conversion of @xmath6 value from a.u . to reciprocal centimeters at the level of @xmath38",
    "this indicates , that one can not exclude the possibility , to determine the electron - proton mass ratio from future high precision studies of h@xmath0 .",
    "the approach based on explicitly correlated exponential functions and the obtained results pave the way to a significant progress in the theory of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "a similar precision for nonrelativistic energies can be achieved for any other molecular level of h@xmath0 , d@xmath0 , hd , and heh@xmath39 .",
    "considering the leading relativistic corrections , they can be expressed in terms of an expectation value with the nonrelativistic wave function , so their evaluation does not pose a significant problem , and they have already been calculated in the bo approximation .",
    "the leading quantum electrodynamics effects are more complicated due to bethe logarithm contribution , which involves the logarithm of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian .",
    "its calculation beyond the bo approximation might be problematic . however , much more challenging is the calculation of the higher order @xmath5ry contribution , which apart from hydrogen , was calculated only for he atom .",
    "its magnitude can be estimated by @xmath40 times the known leading relativistic correction to @xmath6 of @xmath41 , which gives @xmath42",
    ". it would be probably necessary to approximately evaluate also @xmath43ry corrections to achieve @xmath44 accuracy , as it is enhanced by the presence of @xmath45 factors .    at the level of accuracy of @xmath4 , the proton charge radius , which contributes about @xmath46 to the dissociation energy of h@xmath0 ,",
    "can be determined with 0.5% precision , provided that equally accurate measurement is performed .",
    "this certainly will resolve the proton charge radius discrepancy , which is at the level of 4% , and will open a new era in precision quantum chemistry . regarding the tests of hypothetical forces , which are beyond those in the standard model , the atomic scale is the natural region for the long range hadronic interactions .",
    "moreover , it has recently been shown that vibrational levels of the hydrogen molecule @xcite are particularly sensitive to the interactions beyond the coulomb repulsion between nuclei .",
    "so any deviation between hopefully improved theoretical predictions and the experiment may signal a new physics .",
    "this research was supported by the national science center ( poland ) grants no .",
