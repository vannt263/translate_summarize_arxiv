    "in an early paper on the interaction between radiation and molecular dipole moments @xcite , dicke formulated a model which was later shown to exhibit a super - radiant phase transition@xcite .",
    "the notion that such phase transitions should exist in condensed matter systems has been investigated in a series of papers by preparata and coworkers@xcite and others@xcite .",
    "different workers have come to somewhat different conclusions concerning super - radiant phase transitions @xcite .",
    "some doubt has been expressed@xcite concerning the physical laboratory reality of super - radiant phase transition .",
    "the mathematical issues are as follows : ( i ) it appears,_at first glance _ , that quadratic terms ( in photon creation and annihilation operators ) enter into the model via quadratic terms in the vector potential @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) the quadratic terms in the `` corrected dicke model '' appear to destroy the super - radiant phase transition .",
    "our purpose is to show that if the dipole - field interaction is treated in a _ gauge invariant manner_@xcite then the interaction is _ strictly linear _ in the electric field @xmath1 .",
    "thus , quadratic terms are _ absent _ for purely electric dipole - photon interactions [ 28 ] .",
    "these considerations render likely the physical reality of condensed matter super - radiant phase transitions .",
    "to see what is involved , let us first consider a single molecule with an electric dipole moment @xmath2 given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote respectively , the charge and position of the @xmath6 particle .",
    "suppose that the dipole moment interacts with a _ classical _ electric field which is uniform in space , but not in time @xmath7 the molecule will have a time dependent hamiltonian of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinetic energy of @xmath10 particle in the molecule and @xmath11 is the internal coulomb energy of the molecule .",
    "employing the unitary operator @xmath12 in the time dependent canonical transformation @xmath13 yields @xmath14 for completeness of presentation , a derivation of eq.(5 ) is given in appendix a.    note : for classical electric fields of the form in eq.(2 ) , the hamiltonians in eqs.(3 ) and ( 6 ) are _ rigorously _ equivalent .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian in eq.(3 ) depends on linear and quadratic terms in the vector potential @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.(6 ) depends only on the electric field @xmath16 and in a strictly _ gauge invariant _ and _ linear _ fashion .    in the work which follows , both the charged particles and the electromagnetic field",
    "will be treated using quantum mechanics . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss a single molecule in the presence of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "it is proved for the gauge invariant description of the dipole interactions that the coupling between the electromagnetic field and the molecule is linear in photon creation and annihilation operators the results for @xmath17 molecules are discussed in sec.iii .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian has four terms : ( i ) a sum of single molecule hamiltonians , ( ii ) a sum of screened coulomb interaction potentials between neighboring molecules , ( iii ) the radiation field energy and ( most importantly ) ( iv ) a _ strictly linear coupling _ between the dipole moments and the electric field .",
    "dicke - preparata models are defined and explored in sec.iv . in the concluding sec.v , the importance of the super - radiant phase transition associated with linear couplings will be discussed .",
    "the errors by some previous workers who falsely `` voided '' the super - radiant phase transition will be discussed in detail .",
    "consider , as in sec.i , a single molecule having a total number of @xmath18 charged particles with an electric dipole moment @xmath2 as in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the dipole is considered to interact with a quantized electromagnetic field ( photons ) @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 which is again uniform in space .",

    "let us now consider the case of @xmath17 molecules , each of which interact with the quantized electromagnetic field via the electric dipole moment .",

    "is exact but not yet amenable to rigorous mathematical solution . for the purpose of obtaining reasonable answers for ( say ) the free energy ,",
    "further simplifications must be made .",

    "for example , the one - photon loop corrections to the equations of state have long been known to produce casimir - van der waals forces in condensed matter .",
    "such forces can not possibly be gauged away and i. bialynicki - birula and k. rzazewski@xcite are thereby in error .",
    "a further error is found in k. rzazewski , k. wodkiewicz and w. zakowicz@xcite , where it is asserted that the super - radiant phase transition is null and void due to quadratic coupling in the photon creation and annihilation operators . had the canonical transformation",
    "been carried out correctly , as in the present work , then it would have been noted that the coupling between the electric dipole moment and the photons in the gauge invariant eq.(41 ) is _ strictly linear_. the super - radiant phase transition remains intact .",
    "preparata has recently proposed several examples of super - radiant phases in a recent review@xcite .",
    "water is perhaps the most interesting example@xcite . in future work",

    "starting from the schrdinger equation @xmath129 one seeks a solution of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 . putting eq.(a2 ) into eq.(a1 ) yields @xmath132 @xmath133 or equivalently @xmath134 where @xmath135 eq.(a5 ) is the required time dependent canonical transformation .      from eqs.(1 ) and ( 14 ) it follows that @xmath136 eqs.(b1 ) and ( 11 ) then imply @xmath137 thus , the vector potential in the dipole interaction theory may be `` gauged away ''",
    ". however , the dipole interaction returns to the full hamiltonian since eqs.(9 ) and ( 14 ) imply that @xmath138 and @xmath139 from eqs.(7 ) , ( b2 ) and ( b3 ) it follows that @xmath140 where the operator electric field @xmath127 is given in eq.(10 ) , and the molecular self energy @xmath141 is given in eq.(17 ) .",
    "thus the same canonical transformation which gauges away the vector potential in the molecule hamiltonian , brings back the electric dipole interaction @xmath142 when applied to the radiation hamiltonian via eq.(b4 ) . finally , from eqs.(b2 ) and",
