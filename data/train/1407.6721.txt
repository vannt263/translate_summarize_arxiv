    "the strain modifies graphene phonon energy spectrum , which is effectively probed by raman spectroscopy . under uniaxial strain the @xmath340 and @xmath341 phonon bands display significant red shift proportional to the applied strain : a result of the anharmonicity of the interatomic potentials in graphene @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the @xmath415 bonds of graphene lengthen / shorten in the direction parallel / perpendicular to the strain axis .",
    "this reduces the @xmath416 symmetry of the honeycomb lattice to @xmath417 , and splits the doubly degenerate @xmath340 band into two singlet bands , @xmath418 and @xmath419 , with normal modes perpendicular and parallel to the strain axis , respectively .",
    "the polarization of raman scattered light for the @xmath418 and @xmath419 modes is thus expected to depend on the direction of the strain axis relative to the crystal orientation : a conjecture verified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "strain also introduces profound modifications to graphene electronic structure .",
    "the defining topology feature of graphene electronic band , namely the degeneracy of conical electron and hole bands at dirac points , is protected by the inversion symmetry of graphene lattice @xcite .",
    "a small perturbation in form of mechanical strain does not lift the degeneracy , but deforms the energy bands and shifts the dirac points in both the energy and the momentum space .",
    "the former is equivalent to a scalar potential also known as the deformation potential .",
    "a general nonuniform strain generates a spatially varying dilation of the graphene lattice and therefore local ion density .",
    "the deformation potential arises because the corresponding coulomb potential is only partially screened by electrons @xcite .",
    "next , shifting the dirac point in the @xmath420-space away from the @xmath138 ( @xmath421 ) points @xcite .",
    "is analogous to the effect induced by an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the graphene plane .",

    "these processes are not only of fundamental interest due to the unusual electronic structure in graphene , but also important for technological applications of high - field electronics and nonlinear photonic devices @xcite .",
    "response of graphene to a pulsed laser excitation has been studied by several complementary ultrafast spectroscopy techniques .",

    "this picosecond time scale reflects partial thermalization between the hot electron / holes and optical phonons with the acoustic phonons in graphene .",
    "we note that the photo - induced transmission change can become negative at certain probe photon energies at longer delay .",
    "this is because optical excitation not only leads to pauli blocking of interband transitions , but also increased high frequency absorption from intraband transitions . at longer pump - probe delay",
    ", the intraband absorption can dominate over the pauli blocking effects at some probe photon energies .",
    "similar photo - induced transmission decreases have also been observed in optical pump - thz probe measurements , where photo - induced intraband transitions always dominate @xcite .",
    "ultrafast photoluminescence monitors the light emission from the highly non - equilibrium electrons after femtosecond pump excitations @xcite .",
    "broad light emission across the visible spectral range ( @xmath442@xmath443 ) was observed with femtosecond near - ir laser excitation , where the incident photon has an energy of @xmath444 .",
    "this unusual blue - shifted photoluminescence exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the laser fluence , and it has a dominant relaxation time within @xmath445 .",
    "this nonlinear blue - shifted luminescence was attributed to recombination of hot electron - hole plasma generated right after the femtosecond excitation .",

    "such studies show a decay lifetime of @xmath446 for the bz - center @xmath340-mode phonons .",
    "this time scale corresponds to the cooling of the optical phonons through anharmonic coupling to acoustic phonons , and the @xmath446 time constant is similar to that obtained in pump - probe transmission spectroscopy .",
    "there has been a rapidly increasing interest in graphene systems with more than one layer ( for an early review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the electronic structure of blg and mlg is distinctly different from that of slg .",
    "these differences give rise to many new phenomena , ranging from a tunable bandgap @xcite to strongly correlated ground states @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , space limitations and the open debate on the nature of these low - energy states @xcite do not permit us to describe them in any detail . in this short section",
    "we confine ourselves to discussing `` higher '' energy properties of these materials that have been measured by arpes and by optical spectroscopy .",
    "we begin with discussing the quasiparticle dispersion of blg . for the bernal stacked blg , which is the most energetically favorable structure , it is conventionally described by means of five parameters .",
    "they include four hopping integrals @xmath447 , @xmath448 , @xmath449 , @xmath450 , and also the on - site energy shift @xmath451 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1.2.1]b ) . when blg is subject to an electric field due to external gates or charged impurities , the sixth parameter , a scalar potential @xmath452 on the two layers must be included .",
    "the interlayer bias @xmath453 is given by the product of the layer separation @xmath454 and the electric field @xmath133 between the layers .",
    "the blg has four atoms in the unit cell , and so the electron spectrum consists of four bands .",
    "the two outer ( lowest and highest energy ) bands are hyperbolic , with the extremal values at approximately @xmath455 reached at the bz corners .",
    "the shape of the two inner bands is more intricate . at high energies",
    "they are nested with the outer bands . at low energies",
    "their dispersion depends on the relation between the gap @xmath456 and the hopping integral @xmath457 , which causes the trigonal warping . at @xmath458 , the trigonal",
    "warping is a small effect .",
    "the bands are shaped as sombreros , e.g. , the conduction band has a local maximum at energy @xmath459 at @xmath69 and a local minimum  the bottom of the sombrero  at the ring @xmath460 , see fig .",

    "the parabolic extrema split into the four conical dirac points .",
    "this reconstruction is an example of the lifshitz transition .",
    "the linear rather than parabolic shape of the bands in the symmetric blg is supported by the linear-@xmath462 dependence of low - temperature electric conductivity in extremely clean suspended blg @xcite . however , in less perfect samples , the quadruple dirac cones structure is smeared by disorder .",
    "it is therefore common to approximate the inner bands by hyperboloids touching at a point , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5.1.1]d ( left ) .    in order to vary @xmath456",
    ", one has to apply an external electric field to blg .",
    "this can be achieved experimentally through electrostatic gating or doping . if @xmath463 and @xmath464 are electric displacement fields on the two sides of blg ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5.1.1]c ) , then the interlayer electric field @xmath133 is determined by their mean @xmath465 .",
    "notably , @xmath133 is smaller than @xmath466 due to screening effects .",
    "calculations within the self - consistent hartree approximation @xcite predict a factor of two or so reduction in typical experimental conditions .",
    "the difference @xmath467 of the displacement fields produces a net carrier doping , and so the fermi energy shift ( fig .  [ fig:5.1.1]d ) . unless @xmath468 and @xmath469 are precisely equal or precisely opposite , the modification of the band gap @xmath456 and the shift of the fermi energy @xmath148 occur simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the control of electronic structure of blg was first revealed in arpes studies of potassium - doped epitaxial graphene on sic @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig:5.1.1]e - g display the evolution of the arpes spectra with doping .",
    "as prepared , blg is @xmath20-type doped .",
    "this corresponds to a finite @xmath469 and zero @xmath463 , leading to a nonzero bandgap ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5.1.1]e ) .",
    "potassium adsorption generates a finite @xmath463 . when its value is the same as @xmath464 , one obtains an electron doped gapless blg ( fig .",

    "tuning of blg electron structure can be also achieved via coupling to different substrates @xcite .",
    "complimentary insights on the band structure of blg has been provided through ir spectroscopy .",
    "there is a total of six inter - band optical transitions possible in this material .",

    "observing the predicted bandgap value from electrical transport measurements has been challenging .",
    "gated blg typically exhibits an insulating behavior only at @xmath474 , suggesting a very narrow gap @xcite .",
    "this is because electrical transport is extremely sensitive to defects and impurities , and a very high quality graphene is required to reach the intrinsic blg behavior .",
    "recent transport studies @xcite however demonstrate transport gaps closer to those obtained through ir spectroscopy .",
    "electron - phonon coupling in gated blg shows up in tunable electron - phonon fano resonances @xcite . there is a host of other effects that originate from unique gate - tunable electronic structure in blg that have been predicted theoretically and are amenable to spectroscopic studies , e.g. , a rich landau level spectrum structure @xcite .",

    "indeed , at energies above @xmath480 , the measured optical absorption scales linearly with @xmath481 .",

    "the shape of these curves can be understood through zone - folding of the graphite band - structure .",
    "in particular , a gapless band is present if @xmath481 is odd and absent if it is even @xcite .",
    "a wealth of spectroscopic data analyzed in this review has provided a panoramic picture of electronic phenomena in graphene .",
    "the concept of 2d dirac quasiparticles offers a unifying description of the gross features revealed in all spectroscopic and transport probes . at the same time , pronounced and reproducible deviations from the predictions of noninteracting models of graphene have been documented .",
