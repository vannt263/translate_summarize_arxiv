    "coloring problems are among the most studied problems in algorithmic graph theory . in its classical form",
    ", the @xmath1-coloring problem asks if there is an assignment of @xmath1 colors to the vertices of a graph in such a way that no edge is monochromatic .",
    "many generalizations and variations of the classical coloring problem have been defined over the years .",
    "one of such variations is the clique @xmath1-coloring problem , in which the vertices are colored so that no maximal clique is monochromatic . in this article",
    "we study the star and biclique coloring problems , which are variations of the coloring problem similar to clique colorings .",
    "a biclique is a set of vertices that induce a complete bipartite graph @xmath9 , while a star is a biclique inducing the graph @xmath10 . in the star ( biclique )",
    "@xmath1-coloring problem , the goal is to color the vertices with @xmath1 colors without generating monochromatic maximal stars ( bicliques ) .    the clique coloring problem has been investigated for a long time , and it is still receiving a lot of attention .",
    "recently , the clique @xmath1-coloring problem was proved to be @xmath11-complete  @xcite for every @xmath12 , and it remains @xmath11-complete for @xmath13 even when the input is restricted to graphs with no odd holes  @xcite . the problem has been studied on many other classes of input graphs , for which it is was proved to be -complete or to require polynomial time ( e.g.  @xcite ) . due to the close relation between cliques and bicliques , many problems on cliques have been translated in terms of bicliques ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , there are some classical problems on cliques whose biclique versions were not studied until recently  @xcite .",
    "clique colorings are examples of such problems ; research on biclique colorings begun in 2010 in the master thesis of one of the authors  @xcite whose unpublished results are being extended in the present article .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , despite its youthfulness , at least two articles on biclique colorings were written : @xcite develop a polynomial time algorithm for biclique coloring some unichord - free graphs , and @xcite determines the minimum number of colors required by biclique colorings of powers of paths and cycles .",
    "the list coloring problem is a generalization of the coloring problem in which every vertex @xmath14 is associated with a list @xmath15 , and the goal is to color each vertex @xmath14 with an element of @xmath15 in such a way that no edge is monochromatic .",
    "function @xmath2 is called a list assignment , and it is a @xmath1-list assignment when @xmath16 for every vertex @xmath14 .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is said to be @xmath1-choosable when it admits an @xmath2-coloring with no monochromatic edges , for every @xmath1-list assignment @xmath2 .",
    "the choosability problem asks whether a graph is @xmath1-choosable . in the same way as",
    "the coloring problem is generalized to the clique ( star , biclique ) coloring problem , the choosability problem is generalized to the clique ( star , biclique ) choosability problem .",
    "that is , a graph @xmath0 is clique ( star , biclique ) @xmath1-choosable when it admits an @xmath2-coloring generating no monochromatic maximal cliques ( star , bicliques ) , for every @xmath1-list assignment @xmath2 .",
    "the choosability problems seem harder than their coloring versions , because a universal quantifier on the list must be checked .",
    "this difficulty is reflected for the @xmath1-choosability and clique @xmath1-choosability problems in the facts that the former is @xmath17-complete for every @xmath18  @xcite , whereas the latter is @xmath19-complete for every @xmath12  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it is proven that every planar graph is clique @xmath20-choosable . however , contrary to what happens with the clique coloring problem , there are not so many results regarding the complexity of the clique coloring problem for restricted classes of graphs .",
    "in this paper we consider the star and biclique coloring and choosability problems , both for general graphs and for some restricted classes of graphs .",
    "the star and biclique coloring and choosability problems are defined in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , where we introduce the terminology that will be used throughout the article . in section",
    "[ sec : general case ] , we prove that the star @xmath1-coloring problem is @xmath11-complete for @xmath12 , and that it remains @xmath11-complete even when its input is restricted to @xmath21-free graphs . clearly , every maximal biclique of a @xmath22-free graph is a star .",
    "thus , we obtain as a corollary that the biclique @xmath1-coloring problem on @xmath21-free graphs is @xmath11-complete as well .",
    "the completeness proof follows some of the ideas by marx  @xcite for the clique coloring problem . in section  [ sec : choosability ] we show that the star @xmath1-choosability problem is @xmath19-complete for @xmath12 , and that it remains @xmath19-complete for @xmath21-free graphs .",
    "again , the @xmath19-completeness of the biclique @xmath1-coloring problem on @xmath21-free is obtained as a corollary . as in  @xcite , we require a structure to force a color on a vertex .",
    "the remaining sections of the article study the star and biclique coloring problems on graphs with restricted inputs .",
    "these graphs are related to the graph @xmath0 that is generated to prove the @xmath11-completeness of the star coloring problem in section  [ sec : general case ] .",
    "the aim is to understand what structural properties can help make the problem simpler . in section  [ sec : small forbiddens ]",
    ", we discuss the star and biclique coloring and choosability problems on @xmath23-free , @xmath24-free , @xmath25-free , and @xmath26-free graphs . for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "the star coloring and star choosability problems are almost trivial and can be solved in linear time . on the other hand ,",
    "both problems are as hard as they can be for @xmath26-free graphs , even when the input is a co - bipartite graph . in section  [ sec : diamond - free ] we prove that the star coloring problem is -complete for diamond - free graphs and that the star choosability problem is @xmath17-complete for a superclass of diamond - free graphs . if no induced @xmath27 is allowed for a fixed @xmath28 , then the biclique coloring and the biclique choosability problems are also -complete and @xmath17-complete . in section  [ sec : split ] , the star coloring and the star choosability problems on split graphs",
    "are proved to be -complete and @xmath17-complete , respectively .",
