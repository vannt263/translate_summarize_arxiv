    "very recent preprint , written by the author of this paper and broutin , goldschmidt and miermont @xcite , identified the gromov - hausdorff - prokhorov scaling limit of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph and described some of its basic properties .",
    "the current paper complements the work of @xcite by identifying the _ un - rescaled _ or _ local weak _ limit of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph . both the work of @xcite and the current work open avenues for further research , into developing a more detailed understanding of the properties of the limiting objects .",
    "we highlight some specific questions of interest later in the introduction ; for the moment , we jump right to the definitions required for a precise statement of our results .",
    "a _ rooted weighted graph _ ( rwg ) is a triple @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a connected simple graph with countable vertex degrees , @xmath5 is the _ root vertex _ , and @xmath6 assigns weights to the edges of @xmath7 . by convention , we view unweighted rooted graphs with as rwgs , by letting all edges have weight @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath3 is an rwg and @xmath9 is a connected subgraph of @xmath7 containing @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath9 is a graph with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , then @xmath13 is another rwg , and is a _ sub - rwg _ of @xmath14 .",
    "we sometimes write @xmath15 instead of @xmath13 for succinctness , when doing so is unlikely to cause confusion . given @xmath16 with @xmath17 , we write @xmath18 $ ] for the sub - rwg of @xmath14 induced by @xmath19 .    for an rwg @xmath3 ,",

    "( elsewhere we let @xmath23 , but note that here the infimum is non - empty as @xmath7 is connected . )",
    "we similarly define the _ weighted _ graph distance by @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we write @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we say @xmath14 is _ locally finite _ if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "we briefly recall the definition of _ prim s algorithm _ ( also called _ invasion percolation _ ) on an rwg .",
    "let @xmath3 be a locally finite rwg with all edge weights distinct .",
    "if @xmath14 is finite then , writing @xmath31 , the graph @xmath32 is the unique tree @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 minimizing @xmath36 ; in other words , it is the _ minimum weight spanning tree _ ( mst ) of @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 is infinite , however , @xmath37 may be a strict subset of @xmath38 , in which case the tree constructed by prim s algorithm is not a _ spanning _ tree ; we call it the _ invasion percolation cluster _ of @xmath14",

    "turn out to be intimately linked to an associated percolation process .",
    "this can serve as both a motivation and a warning ( to justify the latter epithet , we record newman s observation @xcite that , weighting the edges of @xmath39 by iid uniform@xmath40 $ ] edge weights , the invasion percolation cluster has asymptotically zero density if and only if the percolation probability @xmath41 ) .",

    "aldous proved that @xmath109 converges in distribution in the local weak sense , to an almost surely finite limit , which in our setting has the distribution of @xmath110 .",
    "the convergence of @xmath111 to @xmath112 follows immediately from theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] will also provide an explicit characterization of the limit , which is straightforward enough to yield an exact , though somewhat complicated , description of the distribution of the degree of the root vertex @xmath80 in @xmath113 .",

    "however , using the explicit characterizations of @xmath113 and @xmath121 given in section  [ sec : distribution_info ] , it is a straightforward technical exercise to establish the same bounds for the growth of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .    a similar dichotomy of dimensionality , paralleling the difference in volume growth between @xmath121 and @xmath113 , appears when studying the gromov - hausdoff - prokhorov scaling limit of the minimum spanning tree ; see @xcite for details .",
    "broadly speaking , the tree @xmath121 , which is a subtree of @xmath113 , determines the global metric structure of @xmath113 , in the sense that for `` typical '' nodes @xmath124 of @xmath113 , the distance @xmath125 is of about the same order as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the nearest nodes in @xmath121 to @xmath129 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "however , the bulk of the mass in @xmath113 lies outside of the subtree @xmath121 . theorems  [ thm : volume ] and  [ thm : tvolume ] may be viewed as a step towards formalizing this picture .",

    "the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : tvolume ] is straightforward .",
    "an earlier paper @xcite showed that @xmath121 is stochastically dominated by a poisson@xmath142 galton - watson tree conditioned to be infinite .",
    "this fact , together with existing volume growth estimates for the incipient infinite cluster on trees @xcite , yields the upper bound . for the lower bound in theorem  [ thm : tvolume ] ,",
    "we analyze an explicit description of the distribution of @xmath121 from @xcite .",
    "this description , reviewed in section  [ sec : wwlprim ] , below , states that @xmath121 is comprised of a sequence of poisson@xmath142 galton - watson trees , always of random size but conditioned to be increasingly large as the sequence goes on , and glued together along a backbone . roughly speaking ( ignoring logarithmic corrections ) ,",
    "this allows us to find a subtree of @xmath143 distributed as a conditioned poisson galton - watson tree with around @xmath144 vertices , and containing a backbone node of distance about @xmath145 from the root .",
    "such a ( sub)tree also has diameter roughly @xmath145 , and this yields the lower bound .    to prove theorems  [ thm : main ] and [ thm : volume ] , we introduce , and then study , a two - step construction of the minimum spanning tree @xmath50 .",
    "the construction is more elegant in the @xmath101 limit , so we now outline the construction for @xmath99 .",

    "it will turn out that , almost surely , @xmath156 for all @xmath150 , so @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "we view @xmath2 as being built in two steps ; first , the tree @xmath143 is constructed ( via prim s algorithm , say ) .",
    "second , the remaining vertices of @xmath2 are dynamically exposed by letting @xmath159 grow from @xmath160 to @xmath104 .    for @xmath153 let @xmath161 .",
    "it turns out that , conditional on @xmath162 , the stochastic process @xmath163 is markovian ( this is not a surprise ) and its transition kernel has an explicit and pleasing form .",
    "this picture builds upon on the description of @xmath121 from given in section  [ sec : wwlprim ] , so we postpone the details until section  [ sec : pwag ] .",
    "we now sketch the dynamics of @xmath164 . in brief , at each time @xmath165 , there is some set of _ inactive _ vertices @xmath166 in @xmath154 - these vertices form a subtree of @xmath143 containing @xmath80 .",

    "once a vertex @xmath77 is active , subcritical poisson galton - watson trees begin to attach themselves to @xmath77 according to a particular inhomogeneous rate function which decays exponentially quickly in @xmath159 ; this process happens independently for each active vertex , and is responsible for the growth of @xmath154 as @xmath159 increases .",
    "when a tree attaches to @xmath77 , all its vertices immediately become active .",

    "it seems likely that the lower bound should also be provable `` in the limit '' , but i have been unable to achieve such an argument . for the lower bound",
    ", i instead resort to a somewhat involved second moment calculation , based on an analysis of modified versions of prim s algorithm , started from three distinct vertices ( it turns out to be necessary to consider two vertices aside from the root , which is why three distinct vertices are needed for a second moment argument ) .",
    "finally , the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] proceeds by analyzing a hybrid mst algorithm .",
    "given a small input parameter @xmath119 , the we first prim s algorithm for a random number of steps , halting at a ( stopping ) time @xmath171 that is @xmath172 with high probability is of order @xmath173 , but this information is unimportant to the informal description . ] .",
    "this is the finite-@xmath174 analogue of the limiting `` step one '' and builds a random rwg @xmath175 whose distribution is close to that of @xmath121 for @xmath53 small .",
    "starting from @xmath175 , we then run kruskal s algorithm to complete the construction of @xmath50 .",
    "this second phase corresponds to the limiting `` step two '' .",
    "its relatively straightforward analysis in section  [ sec : mainproof ] will yield theorem  [ thm : main ] .      before turning to proofs",
    ", we briefly outline the remainder of the paper . in section  [ sec : distribution_info ] , we describe a markovian construction of the invasion percolation cluster @xmath95 that was established in an earlier work @xcite and that will be exploited several times in the current paper . we additionally we describe a continuous - time process that builds @xmath113 from @xmath121 ; this process is at the heart of the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] and is also used in proving theorem  [ thm : volume ]",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : consequences ] we note some distributional identities that may be obtained from our results .    in section  [ sec : futuremax ] we analyze the early stages ( the first @xmath176 steps ) of prim s algorithm on @xmath48 , and show that the rwg thereby constructed has @xmath121 as its local weak limit .",
    "this fact allows us to define a finite-@xmath174 growth procedure analogous to @xmath177 , which is used in proving theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : formax ] we establish some useful properties of the decay of weights along the unique infinite path in @xmath121 .",
    "these properties come into play in section  [ sec : volgor ] , in which we prove theorem  [ thm : tvolume ] , and also in proving the lower bound of theorem  [ thm : volume ] .    in section  [ sec : mainproof ]",

    "we prove theorem  [ thm : volume ] .",
    "the upper bound is based on a direct analysis of the process @xmath178 , and ultimately reduces to bounding the value of a certain iterated integral .",
