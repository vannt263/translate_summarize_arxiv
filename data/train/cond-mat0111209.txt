    "<S> we propose an idea for probing spin states of two coupled quantum dots ( cqd ) , by the dc josephson current flowing through them . </S>",
    "<S> this theory requires weak coupling between cqd  and electrodes , but allows arbitrary inter - dot tunnel coupling , intra- and inter- dot coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the coulomb blockade peaks exhibit a non - monotonous dependence on the zeeman splitting of cqd , which can be understood in terms of the andreev bound states . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the supercurrent in the coulomb blockade valleys may provide the information of the spin states of cqd : for cqd with total electron number n=1,3 ( odd ) , the supercurrent will reverse its sign if cqd becomes a magnetic molecule ; for cqd  with n=2 ( even ) , the supercurrent will decrease sharply around the transition between the spin singlet and triplet ground states of cqd .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 74.50.+r , 73.40.gk , 73.20.dx , 72.15.nj .    coupled quantum dots ( cqd ) fabricated in semiconductors , or so called `` artificial molecule '' , is an ideal quantum system for the study of coherent transport . </S>",
    "<S> each quantum dot ( qd ) contains discrete energy levels ( quantized due to spacial confinement ) , which can be tuned independently by the gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the dots is also adjustable , resulting in either `` ionic molecule '' for weak coupling or `` covalent molecule '' for strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - electron interactions play an essential role in the transport properties of cqd , due to that the electrons are added to the molecule one by one , and the conductance exhibits coulomb blockade oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> such appealing system has attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical attentions ,  such as the observations of coulomb blockade in double or triple quantum dots @xcite ; the measurement of microwave spectroscopy of a quantum dot molecule and the comparison with the time dependent theory @xcite ; the analysis of the additional spectra of cqd  in the magnetic field by using single electron capacitance spectroscopy @xcite ; the investigations of electronic correlations and kondo effect in cqd  by two impurity anderson model @xcite , and much more .    nevertheless , the spin -dependent transport through cqd are less addressed @xcite . for a single qd , it was proposed recently that qd in the coulomb blockade regime may act as an efficient spin filter in the presence of magnetic field @xcite . for coupled double qds , </S>",
    "<S> the spin related physics is even more rich . </S>",
    "<S> consider cqd filled with two excess electrons , each dot occupied by one of them because of the large on - site coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> cqd  in this case may have four spin configurations : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , as shown in the lower part of fig.1 . due to the inter - dot tunneling processes , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 and @xmath5 form a spin singlet state with lower energy . in the presence of magnetic field , however , the zeeman energy may overwhelm the singlet binding energy , and @xmath0 or @xmath6 becomes energetically favorable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , cqd may have either a magnetic or a non - magnetic ground state , depending on the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining problem is how to detect these states of cqd . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that by attaching cqd  to two superconductors ( s ) , spin states of cqd  can be probed by measuring the dc josephson current . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is illustrated in the upper part of fig.1 , and hereafter the system is referred to as s - cqd - s . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the dc josephson current is sensitive to the spin polarization of the weak link area of the junction . for the josephson junction coupled by an anderson impurity ( or s - qd - s heterostructure ) , theories show that the critical current will reverse its sign if the impurity ( or qd ) is singly occupied and therefore becomes a magnetic dot @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiment also reported the observation of the @xmath7-junction transition , in a josephson junction consisting of superconducting banks and a weakly ferromagnetic interlayer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the above facts and ideas , we will investigate the supercurrent flowing through s - cqd - s system . </S>",
    "<S> different from some of the previous works , e.g. @xcite , we take @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 , so that the andreev reflection ( ar ) process @xcite and the coulomb blockade ( cb ) effect may `` combine '' with each other ( @xmath10 is the constant of the intra - dot coulomb interaction , @xmath11 is the gap of the superconducting electrodes , and the choice of @xmath8 is physically reasonable ) . in the calculation , we take into account not only intra - dot but also inter - dot coulomb interactions , both of which are found to be important in the fitting of the experimental data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the suggested s - cqd - s system can be described by the following hamiltonian ,    @xmath12    in which @xmath13 is for the cqd , modelled by two impurities coupled by inter - dot interaction and inter - dot tunneling ( @xmath14 is the particle number operator ) ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are standard bcs hamiltonians for the s - wave superconducting electrodes , with superconducting phases @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively @xcite ; and @xmath19 is tunneling hamiltonian , connecting the three parts together .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the study of the eigen states of isolated cqd . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath20 can be exactly diagonalized in the particle number representation , i.e. , in the set of 16 bases @xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite . due to the conservation of particle number and the conservation of spin in @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , the 16@xmath2416 space can be divided into several sub - spaces , @xmath25 we have special interest in the n=2 sub - space , in which @xmath23 is expressed as @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . for the case of identical dots @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the eigen solution of @xmath23 has a simple form : \\{@xmath37 , @xmath38 } , \\{@xmath6 , @xmath39 } , \\{@xmath40 , @xmath41 } , \\{@xmath42 , @xmath43 } , \\{@xmath44 , @xmath45 } , \\{@xmath46 , @xmath47 } , in which @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 are the two new states perturbed from @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are corresponding to the s=1 triplet states with m=1,-1,0 ; while @xmath55 is the s=0 singlet state , with a binding energy @xmath56 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] with the 16 eigenstates of @xmath23 , the occupation number of cqd can be evaluated by using the relation @xmath57 , in which @xmath58 is the density matrix operator . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right insets of fig.2 shows the occupation number per spin @xmath59 vs the resonant level @xmath60 for different zeeman splitting @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in practice , @xmath60 can be tuned by the gate voltage , and @xmath61 induced by applying an in - plane magnetic field . ) </S>",
    "<S> the left inset is for the case of @xmath62 , while the right is for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 depicting the competition between the zeeman energy and the singlet binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> these curves show that cqd with total electron number n=1 , 3 is easily magnetized in a magnetic field , while cqd with n=2 favors a spin singlet state and only transfers to a magnetic state upon a critical magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we turn on the weak coupling between s electrodes and cqd . </S>",
    "<S> `` weak coupling '' means that the supercurrent flowing through cqd only serves as a probe to provide the information of cqd , without disturbing the quantum states there . to include the tunneling between the two dots and the physics of ar , a 4@xmath244 representation is introduced , @xmath65 notice that the retarded green function of the isolated cqd ( @xmath66 ) can be constructed exactly by the lehmann spectral representation , @xmath67 in which @xmath68 or @xmath69 runs over the 16 eigenstates of @xmath23 , and @xmath70 or @xmath71 denotes @xmath72 or@xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the full green function of s - cqd - s ( @xmath74 ) can be derived by the following approximation @xcite @xmath75 in which @xmath76 is the self - energy caused by the coupling between s electrodes and cqd . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath76 is obtained as @xmath77 in which @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the coupling strength between left / right electrode and cqd . </S>",
    "<S> then the dc josephson current flowing through s - cqd - s is obtained by the green function technique as @xmath80 in which @xmath81}\\right ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath82 is the fermi distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 $ ] in the denominator has several real roots ( with infinitesimal imaginary part -i@xmath84 ) within the range of @xmath85 , corresponding to the andreev bound states ( abs ) in the s - cqd - s system . to avoid the divergence around these singularities </S>",
    "<S> , we adapt the integral path to a v - shaped contour shown in the middle inset of fig.2 @xcite , as a result @xmath86    fig.2 shows the critical current @xmath87 vs @xmath60 with different @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the curve of @xmath88 , as expected , has four cb peaks , among which are the valleys of the total electron number from n=0 to n=4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the curve is symmetric to @xmath89 by virtue of the electron and hole symmetry . ) with the increase of @xmath61 , the 1st and 4th peak are gradually suppressed @xcite , while the 2nd and 3rd peak exhibit a non - monotonous dependence on @xmath61 : decrease first and reverse its sign to a negative peak , then increase again and diminish at sufficient large @xmath61 . to understand this anomalous @xmath61 dependence , we plot the curves of @xmath90 vs @xmath61 in fig.3a , for a non - interacting s - cqd - s system by setting @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in this case , the approximate eq.(8 ) becomes an exact one , and @xmath66 can be evaluated explicitly . ) for @xmath88 , there are two peaks in the curve separated by @xmath92 ; for @xmath93 , @xmath90 at @xmath94 also exhibits a non - monotonous @xmath61 dependence ( see the up - right inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we know , the supercurrent flowing through cqd is conducted mainly by the abs , which have the property that two adjacent states carry the supercurrent with opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrums of @xmath95 for @xmath96 are shown in the insets of fig.3a . in each spectrum , there are four abs denoted by @xmath97 and @xmath98 within the superconducting gap , and continuous spectrum @xmath99 outside the gap . for @xmath88 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 </S>",
    "<S> are distributed symmetrically to the fermi surface @xmath100 . with the increase of @xmath61 , </S>",
    "<S> these states move down toward @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath102 corresponds to three of abs @xmath97 and @xmath103 are below the fermi surface , while @xmath104 corresponds to all of them below the fermi surface . by taking account of the fermi distribution and the continuous spectrum contribution from @xmath99 , </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous @xmath61 dependence is readily understood . </S>",
    "<S> considering the coulomb interactions will induce more abs in @xmath95 , but the @xmath61 dependence of the peaks in the @xmath105 vs @xmath60 curve can be explained in the similar way .    </S>",
    "<S> we are more interested in the supercurrent flowing in the cb  valleys , since the spin states of cqd  are well defined there . </S>",
    "<S> the curves of @xmath90 vs @xmath61 and corresponding @xmath106 vs @xmath61 are shown in fig.3b , with @xmath60 chosen in the cb valleys of n=1 , 2 , 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the two curves marked with a are typical for the supercurrent flowing in the valley with odd number , where cqd  has a net spin . due to the strong coulomb interaction , small magnetic field ( @xmath107 ) will lead to the transition of cqd from a non - magnetic molecule to a magnetic one ; meanwhile , @xmath90 reverse its sign and experiences a `` @xmath7-junction '' transition . </S>",
    "<S> the two curves marked with b , in contrast , are typical for the supercurrent flowing in the valley with even number , where cqd  may choose a non - magnetic singlet or a magnetic triplet as its ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between them occurs at the critical value of zeeman splitting @xmath108 , with @xmath109 for @xmath62 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 . out of our expectation , for @xmath112 , @xmath110 instead of @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , this might be interpreted as the addition of two @xmath7-junction transitions , namely , the supercurrent reverse its sign after flowing through the first magnetic dot , but returns back after flowing through the second one .    to sum up </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the dc josephson current flowing through s - cqd - s hybrid system . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation is based on the exact diagonalization of coupled two impurity model and the construction of green function in the spectral representation . to avoid the difficulty of solving the exact abs </S>",
    "<S> , we choose a v - shaped integral contour in the complex @xmath114 plane . in the numerical study , we find that the dc josephson current flowing through s - cqd - s can provide rich information of the spin polarization of cqd . </S>",
    "<S> the cb peaks exhibit a non - monotonous dependence on the zeeman splitting of cqd , the current in the cb valleys can be used to probe the spin states of cqd . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the proposed s - cqd - s system is within the scope of the update nano - technology in s/2deg heterostructure , and we are looking forward to seeing the relevant experiments .    </S>",
