    "motion of test particles under the combined effects of gravity and radiation is of obvious astrophysical significance , mainly in the case of the rarified atmosphere around a bright compact source . in the literature",
    ", such a motion has mostly been studied while approximating the particle - radiation interaction by a thomson - like term which specifies , through an effective cross - section constant , what part of the radiation s relative momentum is transferred to the particle . adopting this approach ,",
    "we have analyzed the  poynting - robertson effect \" of radiation drag in the equatorial plane of the schwarzschild and kerr background space - times , for an outgoing or ingoing  radial \" photon flux with zero or non - zero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "then we have also considered @xcite the case of a non - test flux involved in the _ exact _ vaidya solution , describing a spherically symmetric centre emitting or accreting radiation .",
    "these papers may be consulted for a wider review of literature on this topic .    in the meantime , several new contributions to the subject have appeared .",
    "@xcite presented a numerical treatment of particle trajectories in the radiation field of a slowly rotating kerr - like source , where the existence of equilibrium circular orbits (  suspension \" orbits ) was confirmed .",
    "@xcite studied the halt and  levitation \" of particles at the corresponding  eddington sphere \" and discussed its implications for accretion onto a luminous star . in accord with intuition and experience",
    ", they concluded that the effective cross section of such a shining source is typically less than the geometric value , because the infall onto the star s surface is prevented by outgoing radiation .",
    "in contrast , @xcite inferred from numerical experiments that luminosity _ enhances _ the effective cross section of a relativistic centre about 4 times . @xcite and @xcite analyzed the response of the matter suspended on the equilibrium  eddington sphere \" on a sudden luminosity change , mainly aiming at determination of conditions under which ejection from the system may occur .    in the present paper , we consider a radiative flux directed away from the equatorial plane in the ",
    "vertical \" direction , in an effort to model the situation which may be generated by a thin accretion disc surrounding a compact gravitational object .",
    "we investigate the behavior of test particles above the disc , mainly in the region near the axis of symmetry",
    ". this question has already been tackled several times in the literature in connection with the acceleration / deceleration and axial collimation of astrophysical jets apparently coming out of the above - type accretion systems both on stellar and galactic scales . in a seminal paper ,",
    "@xcite calculated the action of radiation on particles in the neighbourhood of a thin disc around a black hole ( represented by a newtonian centre ) in their study of various possible consequences of radiation emission on the disc accretion .",
    "they mainly analyzed the dependence of particle motion ( and of the latter s aftermaths ) on the value of luminosity , assuming this is generated by the relativistic version of the shakura - shunyaev  @xmath0-model \" of thin discs due to novikov and thorne , and deduced , in particular , that accretion ceases to be possible ( at least against the direction of the main energy release ) when the luminosity approaches some value around the eddington one .",
    "it was also suggested there that radiation push could  sow \" ( weak ) electric currents and thus electromagnetic field in plasma due to its stronger effect on electrons than on ions .",
    "next , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the radiation acceleration and collimation of test particles or fluid within funnels of thick discs , assuming a thomson - type interaction .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite argued that ",
    "the greatly enhanced radiation pressure force felt by a relativistic plasma is accompanied by catastrophic compton cooling and only under extreme conditions can it lead to relativistic bulk velocities . \"",
    "this conclusion was also confirmed by @xcite in their study of radiation - drag deceleration of very fast outflows .",
    "then @xcite considered the motion of test particles moving along the symmetry axis of the schwarzschild or kerr space - times under the influence of radiation from a thin test disc determined by the novikov - thorne model .",
    "they propagated the radiation predicted by this model to the location of the particle and there integrated over the latter s local sky , taking into account all the effects of general relativity resulting from the curvature of space induced by a central black hole .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor obtained in this manner was then projected onto the particle s four - velocity in order to find the force which the radiation exerts on the particle .",
    "the authors concluded that the general relativistic effects on the radiation field ( redshift , ray bending , dragging ) do not affect the terminal speed of the particle significantly and also did not observe any significant effect of radiation on the axial pre - collimation of particles launched from the surface of the disc .",
    "they noticed , however , that the results did depend strongly on the luminosity profile of the disc primarily through the rotation of the central object and pointed out that different conclusions might therefore be reached with different disc models .",
    "since the black holes supposed in astrophysical sources may be spinning rapidly , the question also appeared naturally whether the rotating ( kerr ) space - time geometry could not itself accelerate and/or axially ( pre-)collimate outflows emerging from its inner region  see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , today the astrophysical jets are believed to be mainly driven by magneto - hydrodynamical effects ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the meantime , the interest in _ radiation _ acceleration of jets has continued and more astrophysically quite sophisticated treatments have appeared since then , incorporating radiation from specific models of accretion discs , a more realistic description of the radiation - particle interaction ( dependent on energy and taking into account heating of the particle as well as its radiation losses ) , specific particle content of the outflow ( electron - proton or / and electron - positron jets , for example ) , magnetic fields or / and special geometry of the interaction region (  funnels \" of thick accretion discs , in particular )  see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and their references .",
    "let us conclude this overview by @xcite who have studied the influence of disc radiation on dynamics of particles at the inner edge , placing the accretion system around a rapidly rotating kerr black hole .",
    "they found that for particles around the innermost stable circular orbit the effect of radiation becomes almost entirely azimuthal and that , interestingly and contrary to a standard intuition , it rather changes from _ drag _ to acceleration .",
    "this should enhance the efficiency of a  cosmic battery \" mechanism in which the radiation push might trigger the jet outflows indirectly , through the production of magnetic field .",
    "we would like to compare these various results ( especially those of @xcite ) with what can be found using the approach we have taken in previous papers .",
    "restricting to the schwarzschild case for simplicity now , in section  [ flux ] we _ prescribe _ the radiative flux to be emanating perpendicularly from the equatorial plane ( where the thin accretion disc is imagined to lie ) and study its properties , and then its interaction with the test particles in section  [ interaction ] . then in section  [ approximation ] we suitably approximate the photon trajectories , choose the equatorial energy - density profile of the flux and extend it off the equatorial plane by approximating the conservation laws which govern its behavior .",
    "then we add the contributions from two opposing radiation streams which  due to the symmetry  pass through each point and then compute their effect on the particle motion .",
    "numerical examples are given in section  [ examples ] and the concluding section ends with several remarks and plans for further study .",
    "note that we use geometrized units in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 , greek indices take the values @xmath3 and latin indices @xmath4 , and partial derivatives are indicated by a comma .",
    "a thin accretion disc in the equatorial plane would certainly emit radiation in all directions , but it is perhaps a natural zero - order approximation to assume that most of the flux is directed perpendicularly to this plane .",
    "actually , @xcite calculated , for a particle at any given location , the radiation force by integrating contributions from all directions over the whole novikov - thorne disc , and found a  cosine law \" peaked along the vertical axis .",
    "however , since the disc itself orbits around the centre ( in fact extremely fast in the case of very compact centre ) , the radiation it emits should have some angular momentum , but we will still set this angular momentum to zero here , not only for simplicity , but mainly because otherwise the radiation could not reach the vicinity of the axis .",
    "thus we assume that a static axially symmetric thin test disc lies in the equatorial plane @xmath5 of the schwarzschild black hole outside some radius greater than the horizon radius , and that the photons emanate from it in the perpendicular directions and follow geodesics .",
    "due to the axial symmetry , each spatial point above the disc is then crossed by two rays , except for the symmetry axis @xmath5 where at each point all the rays starting from a certain circular loop meet in a  caustic \" , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vertical - photons ] .     for a typical  meridional \" plane through the symmetry axis .",
    "through each spatial location pass two rays , except for the axis where each point is crossed by photons coming from an entire equatorial circle .",
    "photons starting from below @xmath6 fall into the black hole ( the grey circle ) and are not shown .",
    "in all the plots the axis values are given in the units of @xmath7 . ]    writing the metric in the standard schwarzschild form @xmath8 with @xmath9 , our photons with zero axial angular momentum have non - zero four - momentum components given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes their impact parameter , @xmath12 is their energy at infinity and @xmath13 is their  carter constant \" , all remaining conserved along the rays ; the signs @xmath14 and @xmath15 fix the orientation of the meridional - motion components .",
    "at each location above the circular photon orbit at @xmath6 , this ",
    "null dust \" constitutes an outward flux ( @xmath16 ) which would admittedly drag any test particle along . besides the shape of the photon trajectories , the angular distribution of the flux and thus of the particle acceleration / deceleration  in particular , the eventuality that the particles might be driven into a collimated outflow",
    "depend on the  luminosity profile \" fixed in the equatorial plane , namely on a chosen equatorial radial profile of the constants of the motion @xmath17 and @xmath18 that the photons are endowed with , but mainly on energy density of the flux determined by conservation laws .",
    "the constants are constrained by the requirement that the rays depart orthogonally from the equatorial plane , namely by the condition @xmath19 there , which takes the form @xmath20    this radius - dependent constraint implies that only one of the two constants of the motion may be chosen to have the same value _ across _ all the rays , thus determining the other as a function of the initial radius . regarding the supposed accretion - disc temperature profiles",
    ", it does not seem wise to endow all the photons with the same energy @xmath21 , and also the resulting profile of @xmath22 implied by the constraint is not very plausible .",
    "we will therefore fix the carter constant @xmath23 instead , which implies that the energy profile has to read @xmath24 ; it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ e - profile ] .",
    "since real accretion discs are supposed to be considerably hotter at smaller radii , but this property is somewhat opposed by larger redshift there with respect to infinity , the profile seen in the figure seems to be a reasonable choice , in particular it properly goes to zero at the horizon .",
    "rough as the @xmath25 choice may seem , the corresponding energy profile in fig .",
    "[ e - profile ] actually well resembles the temperature profiles obtained from standard models of thin discs  see , for example , @xcite who compared , in their figure 7 , the temperature profiles for discs around a newtonian centre , around a schwarzschild black hole and around neutron- or strange - star models employing different equations of state ; useful plots were also presented by @xcite , showing the temperature profiles of shakura - sunyaev and novikov - thorne thin discs around a schwarzschild centre in general relativity and in simple @xmath26 theories ( see their figures 10 and 14 , in particular ) .",
    "now , taking ratios of eqs .",

    "this profile is just the reciprocal of the well known effective potential for free radial motion of massless particles in the schwarzschild space - time .",

    "its graph is everywhere concave upward , having two real roots above the horizon , one below and one above @xmath36 .",
    "all our photons start moving perpendicularly from the equatorial plane at @xmath37 and escape to infinity , which means that the integration is performed just from the outer root @xmath32 ( turning point of radial motion ) up to a desired radius @xmath37 . assuming without loss of generality that the photons start moving  upwards \" from the equatorial plane ( i.e. , that @xmath38 initially ) , one finds the solution formula obtained by darwin @xcite ( see also equation ( 260 ) in chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",

    ", this sign should only appear in front of @xmath60 terms : actually , one can effectively treat @xmath60 ( as well as @xmath56 itself ) as positive for photons which have not yet crossed the axis while as negative for those which have already crossed it .",
    "such a distinction will be important in evaluation of the photon effect on the particle , because at each ( non - axial ) point the particle interacts with just _ two _ photons  one approaching the axis and one already receding from it ( the latter started from smaller equatorial radius than the former , so it has been bent more ) .    unfortunately , equation ( [ theta(r ) ] ) represents only an _",
    "implicit _ relation between @xmath61 and @xmath32 and can only be solved numerically for @xmath32 in general .",
    "more precisely it determines the trajectory of the photon as parametrized by its starting radius @xmath32 , which can in principle be inverted to  reconstruct \" @xmath32 as a function of the actual photon s position @xmath61 ( this inversion is unique , at least if restricting to @xmath32 larger than a certain radius slightly above @xmath36 in order to discard photons which make more than one full revolution in @xmath56 before reaching infinity ) .",
    "being able to trace @xmath32 from the actual position @xmath61 within the photon flux , one then also learns the distribution of photon energy @xmath21 in space ( and thus of their impact parameter @xmath62 as well ) , because @xmath32 is uniquely related to @xmath63 ( at least at @xmath64 , which is relevant ) , namely @xmath65 where @xmath23 is an absolute constant , and the subscript notation indicates this implicit relationship .",
    "the radiation flux will be described as an incoherent  null dust \" with energy - momentum tensor @xmath66 where @xmath67 scales the radiation energy density .",
    "the latter has to be fixed by the conservation law @xmath68 after choosing a certain profile on some surface stretching across the rays ; in our case , it is natural to choose the equatorial profile @xmath69 . for an incoherent radiation flux",

    "hence for the particular  vertical \" flux chosen in the previous section , @xmath72 is satisfied trivially due to @xmath73 ( in the equatorial plane , @xmath74 also holds automatically , because @xmath19 there ) , while the other components reduce to a single common condition @xmath75 which says that the evolution of @xmath76 _ along the photon congruence _ is tied to the latter s expansion @xmath77 ; somewhat more explicitly , @xmath78.\\ ] ] an even more explicit equation follows using equation ( [ photon - momentum ] ) to substitute for @xmath79 . in doing so , one has to realize that the differentiation is performed in a _",
    "general _ direction , not just along the photon rays , so it must be performed with every quantity that is not constant all over the radiation field ; in particular , this even applies to the constants of geodesic motion ( which are only constant _ along the rays _ ) unless they are same for _ all _ the rays . with our choice made in previous section",
    ", this means that one has to consider the energy @xmath21 to be a function of @xmath61 , whereas @xmath23 is left constant since it has been chosen to be the same for all photons .",
    "the conservation condition can thus be expressed as @xmath80 or after substitution for @xmath81 @xmath82 expanding the product derivative and dividing through , one finds @xmath83 where @xmath84 according to the constraint ( [ ek - constraint ] ) .",
    "apparently it is correct to keep the @xmath59 sign in the equation in order to distinguish between the flux approaching the axis and its successor continuing after crossing the axis , since otherwise the @xmath56-derivative would jump across the axis due to the reversal of the @xmath85 orientation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to check whether the radiation flux from the disc could not accelerate test particles and/or collimate them in the direction perpendicular to the disc plane . hence , consider a test particle moving in the schwarzschild field and influenced by interaction with radiation described by the null dust energy - momentum tensor of equation ( [ tmunu ] ) .",
    "if the interaction is dominated by thomson scattering , it is convenient to approximate its effect on the particle in terms of the fraction of transferred radiation momentum , as seen in the particle s rest frame , i.e. , by the equation of motion @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the test - particle proper time , four - velocity and four - acceleration , @xmath90 is the projector onto the particle s local rest space and @xmath91 is an effective constant scaling the interaction strength ( with dimensions of length ) ; the second version of the right hand side is written in terms of the relative photon energy and momentum with respect to the particle , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which result from the decomposition @xmath94    despite the elegant form ( [ equation - of - motion ] ) of the equation of motion , the expressions for @xmath95 and @xmath93 make it rather cumbersome to be given explicitly here , the only simplification occurring thanks to the zero azimuthal motion of photons , @xmath96 .",
    "note , however , that although both the gravitational and radiation fields are axially symmetric ( @xmath97 ) , the force does contain a nonzero azimuthal component if the particle s velocity has some , because of the projection term @xmath98 .",
    "in order to evaluate the effect of the photon flux on the test particle at a given point @xmath61 , one would have to solve equation ( [ theta(r ) ] ) for @xmath32 and find the photon energy @xmath99 or the impact parameter @xmath100 ( and thus the momentum of the incoming photon ) there .",
    "then one would have to determine @xmath67 at that point by solving the continuity equation ( [ div(phi2.p)=0 ] ) with a prescribed  velocity \" @xmath101 .",
    "if we do not want to resort to pure numerics to accomplish these two steps , we can consider trying analytic approximations .    a natural approach is to linearize the problem in some small parameter .",
    "we have @xmath102 and , restricting to the astrophysically relevant case @xmath103 , also @xmath104 , while @xmath105 and @xmath100 are less clearly related : all the photons start from @xmath106 , but quickly get to @xmath107 and then even to @xmath108 .",
    "one may linearize consistently in several small parameters , but the most frequent is the linearization in @xmath7 which is always the smallest one .",
    "however , darwin s exact solution ( [ theta(r ) ] ) is often better approximated by an ad hoc formula rather than by applying some general approximation scheme ; this is mainly true at low radii where the weak - field linearizations give too  weak \" result ( we will discuss this issue in more detail elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "a good example is the formula provided by beloborodov @xcite which is often used in the accretion - disc community .",
    "another usable possibility is to approximate the photon meridional - plane trajectory by a suitably adjusted hyperbola .",
    "choosing correctly the asymptotic angle @xmath109 along which the photon approaches radial infinity , such a hyperbola may be the best approximation at large distances , though close to a horizon it is again bent less than the actual relativistic trajectory . given the symmetry of our radiation field , both these options can only be used for photons that make less than a @xmath110 change in direction , however .",
    "still another possibility is to use a pseudo - newtonian approach and simulate the schwarzschild field by a suitably modified newtonian - type potential .",
    "various forms of such a potential have been suggested , starting from the well known cases of paczyski and wiita , @xmath111 ( also used in some of the papers cited in the introduction ) , or nowak and wagoner , @xmath112 ; see e.g. , the form @xmath113 , with constant @xmath0 , advocated by @xcite recently ( specifically with @xmath114 ) which has also proven quite satisfactory in our photon - motion problem .",
    "actually , it is possible to design a number of rather accurate approximations of the photon trajectories .",
    "however , the photon motion is not the full story here : we also have to employ its description ( inverted for @xmath32 , and thus for @xmath100 ) in the continuity equation ( [ equation - for - phi ] ) and then solve the latter for the flux density @xmath76 .",
    "although a chosen approximation may allow for a tractable inversion , this often makes the continuity equation too difficult to solve , even after linearization in @xmath7 .",
    "one approximation which leads to a solvable form of the continuity equation is reached by the usual linearization in @xmath7 .",
    "linearizing thus darwin s formula ( [ theta(r ) ] ) gives @xmath115 which inverts to @xmath116 note that on the axis the latter yields @xmath117 these equatorial radii @xmath118 , @xmath119 should then be substituted into the impact parameter @xmath120 and this in turn into equation ( [ photon - momentum ] ) in order to find momenta of the two photons which hit the particle at the given location @xmath61 .",

    "it is clearly seen that the first radiation flux is more concentrated ( towards smaller radii ) .",
    "it can be estimated that with a more accurate solution of the continuity equation ( namely higher - order in @xmath7 ) , the flux would more bend around the black hole ( consider that the linearization in @xmath7 makes the centre s field weaker ) , so it will spread to the axis slightly sooner ( i.e. , at smaller radii ) than in the present plots and the secondary flux component ( after crossing the axis ) would be correspondingly stronger .                 on the axis ( @xmath58 ) with initial velocity @xmath178 in the radial direction and @xmath179 in the latitudinal direction with respect to a local static observer .",

    "the rather concentrated flux is chosen ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) .",

    "the final step is to study the equations of motion ( [ equation - of - motion ] ) numerically , in order to see whether and under which conditions the test particles tend to be accelerated and/or collimated along the symmetry axis .",
    "first , one has to  connect with nature \" by choosing reasonably several free scale factors , namely the globally constant square @xmath23 of the photon angular momentum , the constant multiplicative factor which scales the energy density of the flux @xmath76 , and the constant @xmath91 which scales the efficiency of the photon @xmath186 particle momentum transfer . as discussed in previous papers ( see mainly @xcite , last part of section 2 ) , it is advantageous to follow @xcite and combine all these factors into a single effective quantity ( denoted by @xmath187 ) which has a useful interpretation .",
    "namely , for a purely radially outgoing flux in a spherically symmetric field , it is given by @xmath188 which is constant and equal to @xmath7 when the flux has exactly the eddington value .",
    "( the connection between the quantities @xmath187 , @xmath189 and luminosity was explained in @xcite , sections 3.1 and 3.2 . )",
    "our flux is surely not radial and its photons do not have the same energy , so such a quantity is not constant in general and can only loosely be related to the eddington luminosity , but it is still very helpful when trying to adjust the scheme to realistic parameters , with the @xmath190 value serving as  benchmark \" .",
    "let us add that the actual accretion - disc flux may perhaps be highly super - eddington , mainly if it comes out of the system in a direction where it does not counteract accretion ; however , super - eddington flux is not likely to be generated by a _ thin _ accretion disc .    more specifically , we have @xmath191 , so in the equatorial plane the expression can be written in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath32 alone , @xmath192 since all components of the  vertical \"- photon four - momentum ( [ photon - momentum ] ) are scaled by @xmath193 , the force term in the equation of motion @xmath194 is proportional to @xmath195 , which is well estimated by @xmath187 since the remaining factor @xmath196 lies between @xmath197 and 1 and is typically close to 1 . hence , for example , having the solution for @xmath76 ( namely the converging - flux solution @xmath135 ) , one can take its equatorial maximum @xmath198 and then choose @xmath180 according to @xmath199 . for a ",
    "10-times eddington \" disc one simply takes 10 times more .",
    "the weak - field approximations  like that obtained by linearization in @xmath7generally yield trajectories ",
    "less bent about \" the central gravitating body .",
    "when using such an approximation for our photon field , this means that both the trajectories of individual photons and the corresponding flux are oriented , at generic location , more in the vertical direction ( they are less affected by the centre ) than they would be in the exact description . for the flux",
    "this imperfection is no issue ( our solutions are anyway represented by everywhere positive and smooth functions ) , but the approximate description of the individual trajectories can actually cause problems .",
    "namely , since the centre s field is effectively weakened , an occurrence of a photon at a particular location may lead to inferring wrongly that it must have started from very close to ( or even _ below _ ) the horizon ( a horizon is not actually present in an approximate description ) . in our case , the main problem occurs when the particle is close to the equatorial plane ( especially if it is also at small radius ) , in particular , when one asks from where the photon started which should hit the particle there : according to the approximate picture , the photon which started from the opposite half of the equatorial plane can only get there if it started very close to the horizon or even from @xmath200 .",
    "hence , in a certain region close to the equatorial plane the approximation is not usable for the  secondary \" photons ( those which have already crossed the symmetry axis ) , because it would lead to negative @xmath196 there and thus to imaginary @xmath100 and @xmath21 .",
    "( this can be simply checked by plotting the formula ( [ req , no - linearization ] ) for @xmath32 in the @xmath149 case . )",
    "there are two possible responses to this issue .",
    "the first possibility is to take into account the secondary photons only outside the region where the above problem occurs .",
    "this is a reasonable option since the secondary flux is negligible anyway in the equatorial region close to the centre ( while the primary flux is the strongest there , on the contrary ) .",
    "the second possibility is to use a better approximation for the individual photon trajectories , without necessarily abandoning the flux density @xmath76 obtained from the weak - field approximation .",
    "( we saw that the latter yields a well - behaved result . )",
    "such an option might be considered inconsistent , yet still it is better than using the linear approximation  consistently \" ( for the description of photon trajectories as well as for the continuity equation ) : the particle motion is mainly misrepresented if the impacting photon momenta are not correct , especially in the initial phase of motion close to the black hole ( and remember that the momenta also enter the energy - momentum tensor ) , whereas details of the radiation density field are not that crucial ; if the distortion due to approximation is not very large , one can understand the result as representing a field emitted by some slightly different source , which is no problem , because the radial profile of the radiation flux was chosen  by hand \" anyway ( though of course in accord with predictions of the accretion - disc theory ) .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to also treat the innermost region close to the black hole properly , it is crucial to approximate the photon trajectories very accurately and , in addition , to be able to solve  at least in linear order in @xmath7 , say  the form of the continuity equation obtained after substituting this approximation . as already discussed in section [ approximation ] , we suggest and will use the approximation of the photon trajectories by the parametrized family of curves ( [ our - approximation ] ) which can be inverted to yield the initial radius @xmath201 specifically , we have used this formula with the parameter values @xmath125 and @xmath126 which yield a very accurate description , much better than the linearization in @xmath7 of the exact result and even better than the well known formula by beloborodov which can not be used below @xmath128 and also is not easily invertible .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ approximations ] for comparison and @xcite for a more thorough account . )",
    "as already stressed above , it is favourable that for @xmath148 and to linear order in @xmath7 , this formula leads to the _ same _ continuity equation as the formula following from linearization in @xmath7 of the exact trajectory , so it is _ consistent _ with the flux @xmath135 already found ( at least up to linear order in @xmath7 ) .",

    "[ ingoing - fans ] and [ flux1-interaction - strength ] both the projections give the same result since the trajectories shown there have no azimuthal motion at all ( zero angular momentum ) .",
    "hence , while some of the intersections occurring in the plots are only seeming ( namely those in fig .  [ from - equat - rest ] ) , the trajectories in fig .",
    "[ ingoing - fans ] do really intersect due to the stronger  repulsive \" effect of radiation on particles which have approached the disc more closely .",
    "the picture of a black - hole thin accretion disc shining mainly in directions perpendicular to its plane has lead us to consider a radiation flux starting just perpendicular from the equatorial plane of a schwarzschild field and to check how such a vertical flux affects test particles around the disc ( which would otherwise follow geodesics of the background space - time ) .",
    "numerical examples confirm that it can drive the particles effectively in motion along the axis accelerating and collimating them in that direction .",
    "however , for an astrophysically relevant range of flux and interaction - strength parameters , the acceleration of particles in itself is not enough to explain the highly relativistic energies observed in some jets emanating from black - hole sources ; namely , we have observed  terminal \" lorentz factors not much larger than 2 in our examples .",
    "this conclusion agrees with observations made in the literature ( see mainly the references given in the introduction ) and seems to be rather robust with respect to a detailed profile of the flux , so it can be expected to also hold for more sophisticated models of disc emission with this same radiation - particle interaction mechanism .    also known from the literature is another experience : when the flux is very strong , its detailed distribution is much more important for the trajectory than the particle s initial velocity . actually , as already voiced in @xcite :  the difference in the initial velocity  practically does not affect the results , since a proton acquires a velocity an order of magnitude higher  in a time much smaller than the orbital period [ as being pushed by radiation ] , and the initial condition is rapidly forgotten . \"",
    "( on the contrary , initial _ location _ of the particle _ is _ of course important . ) our plots do not fully comply with such an experience : we considered relatively strong luminosities , yet the trajectories of particles launched from _ the same _ point ( figs .",
    "[ flux1-fanfrom6 ] , [ ingoing - fans ] , [ velocity - evolution ] ) clearly differ from each other according to their initial velocities .",
    "we have mainly focused on meridional - plane projection of the motion in order to see the vertical effect of the flux , but it is worth to mention that the top views attached in figs .",
    "[ from - equat - rest ] and [ flux1-fanfrom6 ] ( cf . also fig .  [ velocity - evolution ] ) reveal that the azimuthal motion is also far from trivial . as already pointed out at the end of section [ interaction ] , this is mainly due to the term @xmath222 in the equation of motion which is non - zero in spite of the azimuthal symmetry of the gravitational background as well as of the radiation flux .",
    "( let us once more refer to @xcite who focused just on the azimuthal effect and drew interesting conclusions for the disc s inner edge . )    one should mainly investigate now how the results would be modified by a more appropriate description of the radiation - particle interaction .",
    "in fact the inner parts of accretion discs mainly emit in the x - band ( 101000 kev , say ) where one should incorporate compton scattering ( which is described by the klein - nishina cross - section in the rest frame of the particle ) rather than resort to the thomson - like limit where the interaction is only characterized by an effective  coupling coefficient \" @xmath189 independent of frequency",
    ". the results by @xcite who compared these two descriptions in the case of a relativistic spherical source would be important in such an advancement .",
    "another possible improvement would be to proceed to a hydrodynamical description of matter .",
    "needless to say , since our study is purely particle - like , the figures do not in general say how a blob of plasma would move above an accretion disc ; such a question would have to be solved by a hydrodynamic or mhd code .",
    "though at least a qualitative agreement might be expected ( cf .",
    "arguments given by @xcite ) , for a fluid the intersections would presumably lead to a formation of shocks , after which the fluid trajectories might differ significantly from the test - particle ones .    with a more appropriate model of the interaction , one might also proceed to a better model of the disc radiation : emission in all directions should be taken into account , not just the emission perpendicular to the disc , even though the  vertical \" pattern might represent a reasonable overall picture .",
    "also , the radiation should correspond to that emitted by _ orbiting _",
    "matter , so generically having some angular momentum .",
    "( however , due to the emission in all directions , there would also be present photons with zero angular momentum which can reach the symmetry axis . )",
    "rotation should also be incorporated into the gravitational field , proceeding to the kerr background .",
    "finally , one should ensure that the innermost region is also endowed with a _  correct \" _ flux , which would require , besides a very good description of the photon motion ( we hope to have employed a very reasonable approximation here ) , to solve the continuity equation more accurately than up to linear order in @xmath7 .",
    "we are confident that progress can be made along all these routes .",
    "the last point we want to touch on is the question of particle escape .",
    "this has recently been treated by @xcite and @xcite with motivation to learn how changes of the centre s luminosity ( spherically symmetric in their case ) influence particle corona around , in particular , how strong burst is needed for a considerable coronal ejection . in our present paper , rather large luminosities have been chosen and all the particles whose trajectories are shown in the plots escaped to arbitrarily large distances , except one in the middle plot of fig .  [ from - equat - rest ] and seven in fig .",
    "[ flux1-fanfrom6 ] .",
    "however , these were all captured from the close vicinity of the black hole where all the above model imperfections are most serious . before drawing more reliable implications about our system , specifically in case of moderate luminosities when details are even more important",
