    "molecular motors are proteins that transform the free energy released from chemical reactions into mechanical work . in this article",
    "we consider a special class of motor proteins , namely cytoskeletal motors which perform directed walks along cytoskeletal filaments as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "in the cell , these motors have different functions related , e.g. , to vesicle transport and cell division .",
    "the best studied examples are kinesins , which walk along microtubules , and certain types of myosins , which walk along actin filaments . after a certain walking time",
    ", such a motor unbinds from its filament because its binding energy is finite and can be overcome by thermal activation . for kinesins",
    ", this typically happens after 100150 steps or after a walking time of about 1.21.8 seconds , see , e.g. , @xcite . in many motility assays ,",
    "the filaments are immobilized on a substrate and are in contact with an aqueous solution .",
    "in such a situation , the unbound motors diffuse in the surrounding fluid until they eventually reattach to the same or another filament .    recently , we have introduced lattice models to study the motors random walks , which consist of many diffusional encounters between motors and filaments in open and closed compartments @xcite .",
    "if many motors are placed in such a compartment , hard core exclusion between the motors has to be taken into account , since the motors are strongly attracted to the binding sites of the filaments , so that the filaments get overcrowded .",
    "these models are new variants of driven lattice gas models and exclusion processes , for which the active processes which drive the particles are localized to the filaments .",
    "lattice models of driven diffusive systems have been studied extensively in the last years , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "the simplest model is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) in one dimension , where particles hop on a one - dimensional lattice with a strong bias towards one direction ( in the simplest case there are no backward steps at all ) and the only interaction of the particles is hard core exclusion , i.e. , steps to occupied lattice sites are forbidden . when coupled to open boundaries , this simple model already exhibits a complex phase diagram , see e.g. @xcite , which we will review below in some detail .",
    "the first model for the 1dimensional asep was introduced more than 30 years ago by macdonald _",
    "@xcite in the context of protein synthesis by ribosomes on messenger rna ( mrna ) . at that time",
    "it was solved using a mean field approach and used to explain results of radioactive labeling experiments @xcite which showed that protein synthesis gets slower as the ribosome moves on the mrna template .",
    "the model of macdonald _ et al .",
    "_ explained this by the steric hindrance between successive ribosomes along the mrna track .",
    "two years later the same model was discussed by spitzer as a simple example for interacting particles in probability theory @xcite . since then",
    ", the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( and variants ) has been studied extensively as a generic model for non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite and interacting stochastic systems @xcite as well as in other applications such as traffic flow @xcite .",
    "many properties of the 1dimensional asep are known exactly .",
    "as mentioned , the lattice models for random walks of molecular motors differs from the driven lattice gas models in an important way : walks of molecular motors are only driven as long as the motor is attached to a cytoskeletal filament , hence driving is localized to one or several lines .",
    "it can therefore be viewed as an asep which has the additional property , that particles ( molecular motors ) can unbind from the track with a small probability , diffuse in the surroundings and reattach to the same or another filament . in more mathematical terms , the asep is coupled to a _ symmetric _",
    "exclusion process via adsorption and desorption of particles onto filaments .",
    "boundary conditions play an important role in driven systems .",
    "this becomes apparent , e.g. , if one compares a tube  like system with periodic boundary conditions with one with closed boundaries . in the system with closed boundaries ,",
    "a traffic jam of motors arises at one end of the system and the current of motors bound to the filament is balanced by diffusive currents of unbound motors as first shown in @xcite . with periodic boundary conditions , motors arriving at the right end of the system just restart their walk from the left end and a net current through the systems is obtained .    in this article",
    ", we study the stationary states of tube - like compartments with open boundaries .",
    "these compartments have the shape of a cylinder and contain one filament which is placed along the cylinder axis in order to obtain the simplest possible geometry .",
    "the bound motors move along the filament and the unbound motors diffuse within the cylinder , see fig .",
    "[ fig : motor_tube_geom ] . at the ends of the tube ,",
    "motors are inserted and extracted .",
    "such a system is accessible to _ in vitro _ experiments using standard motility assays , but it can also be viewed as a strongly simplified model for motor  based transport in an axon @xcite , if these motors , which are synthesized in the cell body , are at least partly degraded at the axon terminal @xcite , a situation that can be mimicked by insertion and extraction of motors at the ends of a tube . the stationary states depend strongly on the way , in which the motors are inserted and extracted at the boundaries as we will explicitly demonstrate for three different types of boundary conditions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : motor_tube_randbed ] .",
    "our article is organized as follows . after introducing the model in section [ sec : model ] ,",
    "we start in section [ sec : periodic_tube ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this case can be solved exactly , since it satisfies local balance of currents in the radial direction , see appendix [ app_rdb ] . in section [ sec : open_tube ] , we discuss the situation in which the density of bound motors on the filament is fixed at the boundaries . finally , in section [ sec : bounddiff ] , we consider the case where the filament is shorter than the tube and the motors diffuse into and out of the tube . the main tool to study the open systems are monte carlo simulations .",
    "these are supplemented by dynamical considerations and self - consistent or mean field calculations .",
    "some details of the latter calculations are presented in appendix [ app_mf ] .",
    "we consider the motion of molecular motors in a cylindrical tube as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor_tube_geom ] .",
    "the tube has length @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 .",
    "the total number of motors within the tube , denoted by @xmath2 , defines the overall motor concentration @xmath3 note that this concentration corresponds to the particle number density of the motors and , thus , is insensitive to the size of the motor particles . in general",
    ", the latter size depends on the type of motor and on the type of cargo attached to it . in the following",
    ", we will implicitly assume that the motor particle has a linear size which is comparable to the basic length scale @xmath4 as defined further below .",
    "if one wants to study the dependence on the motor particle size in a systematic way , one should measure the overall motor concentration in terms of the volume fraction of the motor particles .",
    "the cylindrical tube contains one filament located along its symmetry axis which is taken to be the x  axis ; the two other cartesian coordinates are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "motors bound to the filament undergo directed motion , while unbound motors diffuse freely . since the motors are strongly attracted by the filament , a large fraction of these motors is in the bound state and mutual exclusion from the binding sites on the filament has to be taken into account even for relatively small overall motor concentrations .    in order to include this mutual exclusion ( or hard core repulsion ) in the theoretical description , we map the system onto a lattice gas model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the lattice is oriented in such a way that its three primitive vectors point parallel to the @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6axis , respectively .",
    "a rather natural choice for the lattice parameter @xmath4 is the repeat distance of the filament , which is @xmath8 nm in the case of kinesin motors moving on microtubule and @xmath9 nm for myosinv motors moving on actin filaments .",
    "the discretized tube consists of one line of binding sites , which represents the filament , and @xmath10 unbound channels , i.e.   lines of lattice sites parallel to the filament .",
    "thus the cross section @xmath11 of the tube is equal to = ( 1+n_ch)^2 . for sufficiently large radii , one has @xmath12 , while for small radii , there are corrections due to the underlying lattice .    in the following , we will measure all distances such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in units of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , for the simulations , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be quoted as integers .",
    "the integer value of @xmath1 corresponds to a certain number of lattice sites along the cartesian coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are perpendicular to @xmath7 and run parallel to two basis vectors of the simple cubic lattice .",
    "thus , the interior of the tube contains all channels with @xmath13 .      at each time step , a bound motor attempts to make a forward or backward step and to jump to the next lattice site to its right or to its left with probability @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , the motor attempts to jump to each of the neighboring sites away from the filament with probability @xmath16 , and does not attempt to jump at all , i.e. , to rest at the filament site , with probability @xmath17 . since the sum of these probabilities is equal to one , we have @xmath18 .",
    "the velocity @xmath19 in the bound state is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the basic time scale of these random walks . in the following",
    ", we will measure all times and rates in units of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "since backward steps are rare for cytoskeletal motors , we will focus on the case @xmath23 , i.e. , we will ignore backward steps .",
    "if the particle unbinds from the filament , it attempts to jump to all nearest neighbor sites of the simple cubic lattice with equal probability @xmath24 . by choosing the time scale @xmath21 as @xmath25 , this hopping probability can be made to fit the diffusion coefficient of unbound motors , @xmath26 . when measured in units of @xmath4 and @xmath21 , the dimensionless diffusion coefficient @xmath27 . in principle , the resting probability @xmath17 can then be used to account for the ratio @xmath28 , which is quite large in the case of kinesin , and to adapt the velocity @xmath19 to the values obtained from experiments @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will often choose @xmath29 in order to eliminate one parameter from the problem .",
    "if an unbound motor attempts to hop to a filament site , the motor binds to it with sticking probability @xmath30 , while the step ( and hence binding ) is rejected with probability @xmath31 .    both in the bound and in the unbound state , hopping attempts can only be successful , if the target site is not occupied by another motor ; otherwise the particle must stay where it is . in the following ,",
    "we will mainly study overall motor concentrations @xmath32 in the range @xmath33 .",
    "for such small values of @xmath32 , mutual exclusion of the unbound motors can be safely ignored . however , because the motors are strongly attracted to the filament , the concentration of bound motors is much larger and it is crucial to take their mutual exclusion into account .",
    "first , we consider a cylindrical tube with periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction . because of the translational invariance in the direction parallel to the filament , there are no net radial currents in the stationary state .",
    "indeed , a non - zero radial current in a state , which is translationally invariant in the longitudinal direction , would lead to net radial transport of motor particles , which is incompatible with the reflecting radial boundaries .",
    "this means that there is a bound current @xmath34 on the filament , but both currents of motors binding to and unbinding from the filament _ and radial currents of unbound motors _ are balanced locally .",
    "we call this situation _ radial detailed balance _ or",
    "_ radial equilibrium_. if there is only one unbound channel , @xmath35 , ( or @xmath10 equivalent channels ) radial equilibrium is equivalent to adsorption equilibrium .",
    "it is clear , that this will no longer be true , if translational invariance is broken by boundaries or blocked sites on the filament .",
    "another important property of systems with periodic boundary conditions is that , in this case , the number @xmath2 of motors in the system is conserved , which does not apply to open systems .    because of translational invariance along the x ",
    "axis , the bound and unbound motor densities , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , do not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , it follows from the absence of radial currents that @xmath37 is also independent of the radial coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "hence @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constant , and radial equilibrium implies the relation @xmath39 which leads to @xmath40 here and below , the densities @xmath36 and @xmath37 are local particle number densities which satisfy 0 _ b1 0 _ ub1 . in dimensionful units , this corresponds to @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "since the total number @xmath2 of motors is conserved , we can use the normalization condition , @xmath43 to obtain a quadratic equation for the densities as a function of the system size and the total number of motors .",
    "since one root is always negative , the physically meaningful solution is : @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression for the unbound density , the bound density @xmath36 follows via eq .",
    "( [ per_rb_bd ] ) and the stationary current is given by @xmath45 .",
    "the current calculated in this way is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strom_perrb ] as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the data points ( circles ) are the results of monte carlo simulations for a system of length @xmath47 and radius @xmath48 and are in very good agreement with the analytical solution .",
    "it follows from the analytical solution that the current @xmath49 vanishes at @xmath50 , behaves as @xmath51 for small @xmath46 , and has the maximal value @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let us add two remarks :    \\(i ) eq .",
    "( [ rdb_formel ] ) , as stated here , can be considered as a mean field equation .",
    "however , using the quantum hamiltonian representation of the stochastic process , it can be shown to hold exactly .",
    "the calculation is simple , but rather technical and is therefore presented in appendix [ app_rdb ] , which shows that stationary states can be constructed as product measures provided the bound and unbound densities satisfy eq .",
    "( [ rdb_formel ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) note that in contrast to a homogeneously driven lattice gas such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process , there is no particle hole symmetry here .",
    "particles attempt to leave the filament with rate @xmath16 to a neighboring site while holes do so with rate @xmath56 , i.e.  particles are strongly attracted by the filament , while holes are not . however , if one considers only the bound density , the current density relationship @xmath45 is invariant under the exchange of particles and holes . as we will see in the next section",
    ", this can lead to an apparent particle hole symmetry for systems with radial equilibrium , because the radial currents vanish and the state of the system can be determined by the bound density alone .",
    "now , let us consider the more interesting case , where the tube is open and the densities at the left and right boundary are fixed . to be precise , we consider two different sets of boundary conditions , ( b ) and ( c ) as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor_tube_randbed ] . in this section ,",
    "we study case ( b ) while case ( c ) will be considered in the next section [ sec : bounddiff ] .    for case ( b ) , we add two layers of boundary sites at @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath13 . as before ,",
    "the filament is located at @xmath59 .",
    "we then fix the density on the additional filament sites according to _ b(x = 0 ) _",
    "b(x = l+ 1 ) _ b , ex , see fig .",
    "[ fig : motor_tube_randbed ] .",
    "furthermore , the densities on the nonfilament boundary sites are chosen in such a way that radial equilibrium as given by ( [ rdb_formel ] ) holds at both boundaries .",
    "these boundary conditions are implemented by the following choice of random walk probabilities .",
    "first , we eliminate two parameters from the problem , namely the jump probability @xmath15 to make backward steps on the filament and the resting probability @xmath17 to make no step at all on the filament .",
    "thus , we take @xmath60 throughout this section .    next ,",
    "when we choose a site within the left or right boundary layer during the monte carlo sweep , we first draw a random number @xmath61 which is uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath62 .",
    "the chosen left or right boundary site is taken to be occupied if @xmath63 or @xmath64 , respectively . if a boundary site with @xmath65 is occupied by a motor particle , this particle attempts to jump into the tube with probability @xmath24 . if the left boundary site with @xmath59 is occupied , the corresponding particle attempts to jump onto the left end of the filament with probability @xmath66 . if the right boundary site with @xmath59 is occupied , this particle can not enter since @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , all particles which jump from a site within the tube , i.e. , from a lattice site with @xmath68 , onto a boundary site , are extracted from the tube .      in the limiting case with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "our system becomes equivalent to the 1dimensional asep , for which the density profiles and the phase diagram are known exactly @xcite .",
    "let us therefore summarize some of the known properties of this process , for which we use symbols without the subscript @xmath71.    for the 1dimensional asep , there are three different phases .",
    "if the density @xmath72 at the left boundary is small and satisfies @xmath73 and if the density @xmath74 at the right boundary is not too large with @xmath75 , the system is in the low density ( ld ) phase , for which the bulk density @xmath76 is equal to the left boundary density , and the current is given by @xmath77 . because of the particle hole symmetry , an analogous situation holds for @xmath78 and @xmath79 [ high density ( hd ) phase ] .",
    "now , the bulk density is given by @xmath80 and the current is @xmath81 . at the line @xmath82 , a discontinuous phase transition takes place , and the bulk density jumps from the left boundary value to the right boundary value .",
    "finally , for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the bulk density @xmath85 and the current attains its maximal value @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , this phase is called maximal current ( mc ) phase . the phase transition towards the maximal current phase is continuous with a diverging correlation length .",
    "the formation of three different phases can be understood in terms of the underlying dynamics of domain walls and density fluctuations @xcite . in the low density and high density phases",
    ", the selection of the stationary state is governed by domain wall motion .",
    "thus consider a domain wall , which forms between regions of different densities .",
    "if its velocity is positive , the domain wall travels to the right boundary and the bulk density is equal to the left boundary density ( low density phase ) .",
    "likewise , the bulk density is given by the right boundary density , if the domain wall velocity is negative ( high density phase ) . at the transition line with @xmath87",
    "the domain wall velocity is zero , and domain walls diffuse through the system .",
    "the second mechanism is related to density fluctuations .",
    "if a small perturbation of the density , corresponding , e.g. , to some added particles , enters the system at the left boundary , it can move with positive or negative velocity , i.e. , it can spread into the bulk or is driven back towards the boundary . in the maximal current phase the velocity of such density perturbations , is negative and density fluctuations coming from the left boundary are driven back to the boundary . hence , increasing @xmath72 does not increase the bulk density , since additional particles can not enter the system ( overfeeding effect ) .",
    "both the velocities of domain walls and of density fluctuations are governed by the same density current relation which is @xmath88 for the 1dimensional asep @xcite .    for the filament in a tube as considered here ,",
    "the velocities of domain walls and density fluctuations are similar to those for the asep in one dimension .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the density ",
    "current relationship on the filament is the same as for the 1dimensional asep provided one rescales all currents by the factor @xmath66 which arises from the possibility to unbind from the filament .",
    "thus , let us first consider the case , where the behavior on the filament is determined by domain walls , i.e.  the low density and high density phases .",
    "drift motion of domain walls is governed by the domain wall velocity on the filament , which is @xmath89 for the one - dimensional asep @xcite .",
    "in the tube system considere here , the domain wall velocity is slowed down compared to this value , because the domain wall of the unbound density must follow the bound density domain wall by binding and unbinding of motors to and from the filament .",
    "however , the sign of the domain wall velocity is the same for this tube system as for the one  dimensional asep , and the domain wall velocity changes sign at the same values of the boundary densities .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath90 can be obtained from the general expression for the domain wall velocity as given in ref .",
    "@xcite by integrating the density over the tube cross - section , which leads to @xmath91 for the geometry considered here .",
    "remember that the unbound densities are related to the bound densities by radial equilibrium at the boundaries .",
    "if a domain wall spreads from the left or right boundary into the system , radial equilibrium will hold approximately in the bulk because of translational invariance , but , in addition , all the way down to the dominating boundary , where we have imposed radial equilibrium via the boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , the current and the bulk density are determined by the bound density at the boundaries .",
    "the drift velocity of fluctuations of the bound density is @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "if the behavior on the filament is determined by this velocity , i.e.  in the case @xmath93 and @xmath94 , radial equilibrium will not hold up to the boundary and unbound motors can enter the tube .",
    "however , after a short distance they will bind to the filament and act like an additional particle in the maximal current phase : the density fluctuation generated by the additional particle moves towards the boundary . therefore in the bulk , the bound density is 1/2 and the current is @xmath95 .    summarizing these considerations",
    ", we predict to find exactly the same phase diagram as for the 1dimensional asep , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasendiag_asep ] .",
    "in fact , we have chosen our boundary conditions ( b ) in such a way that we only have to replace the density @xmath96 of the 1dimensional asep by the bound density @xmath36 and the boundary densities @xmath72 and @xmath74 by the boundary densities on the filament , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the unbound density in the bulk is obtained by radial equilibrium from the bound density .",
    "these expectations are confirmed ( i ) by a detailed analysis of the discrete mean field equations and ( ii ) by extended monte carlo simulations .",
    "a remarkable feature of the phase diagram is that it seems to exhibit particle hole symmetry , while the dynamics does not .",
    "the signature of particle hole symmetry in the phase diagram is the symmetry between the high density and low density phase . in both these phases ,",
    "the bulk density is approximately constant and radial equilibrium holds approximately in the whole system except close to the left or right boundary .",
    "radial equilibrium holds exactly at that boundary which determines the bulk behavior .",
    "therefore radial currents vanish on average and the phase diagram is determined by the bound density alone , resulting in a phase diagram which gives the impression of particle hole symmetry , although this symmetry is broken . indeed ,",
    "even though the substitution of the bound density @xmath36 by @xmath99 leads to the same bound current @xmath34 , it does not lead to the unbound density @xmath100 .",
    "two stationary states with bound densities that are related through particle hole symmetry are characterized by two unbound densities which are both smaller than the bound ones and thus break the apparent symmetry .      to discuss the concentration profiles of the bound and unbound motors , we use continuum mean field equations and compare the mean field results with simulations .",
    "in addition , we make a two - state approximation , i.e. , we consider the case of a single unbound channel , so that a motor can be in only two states , bound to the filament or unbound .",
    "the two - state model is exact for an arbitrary number @xmath101 of _ equivalent _ unbound channels , but it can also serve as an approximation for the original tube systems : since the unbound density depends only weakly on the radial coordinate , we will consider the approximation in which @xmath37 is taken to be independent of @xmath102 and the unbound channels are taken to be equivalent .",
    "this approximation corresponds to a two  state model in which the bound motors are described by the density @xmath103 and the unbound motors by the density @xmath104 .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient for the unbound motors is given by @xmath105 .",
    "using again the mean field approximation , the total current @xmath106 parallel to the tube axis is now given by @xmath107 and the equality between incoming and outgoing currents at any lattice site leads to @xmath108=     { \\tilde\\pi_{\\rm ad}}\\rho_{{\\rm ub}}(1-\\rho_{{\\rm b}})-\\tilde\\epsilon\\rho_{{\\rm b}}(1-\\rho_{{\\rm ub } } ) ,     \\label{e.twostate2}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath26 are the diffusion coefficients of motors in the bound and unbound state , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have introduced the rescaled binding and unbinding rates , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    in order to determine the density profiles",
    "far from the boundaries , we first calculate the homogeneous , @xmath7independent solutions , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , of the two mean field equations ( [ e.twostate1 ] ) and ( [ e.twostate2 ] ) .",
    "the first equation ( [ e.twostate1 ] ) for the total current @xmath106 then reduces to the current  density relationship @xmath114 whereas the second equation ( [ e.twostate2 ] ) becomes @xmath115 which implies radial equilibrium for the @xmath7independent solutions .",
    "we then decompose the densities according to @xmath116 and expand the mean field equations ( [ e.twostate1 ] ) and ( [ e.twostate2 ] ) in powers of the density deviations @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the details of this expansion are described in appendix [ app_mf ] .      for the high and low density phases with @xmath119 , the expansion of the mean field equations up to first order in @xmath117 and @xmath118 leads to an exponential approach @xmath120 of the density profiles towards the homogeneous solutions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , see appendix [ app_mf ] .",
    "the corresponding decay length @xmath121 satisfies the cubic equation @xmath122 which is solved numerically .    for the asep in one dimension",
    ", one has @xmath123 and ( [ e.xi ] ) reduces to @xmath124 with @xmath125 thus , in this limit , mean field theory leads to the correlation length @xmath126 . for @xmath127 , we choose the unique solution of ( [ e.xi ] ) which approaches ( [ e.xi0 ] ) as @xmath10 vanishes .",
    "this solution behaves as @xmath128 for small @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the mean field calculation , we again used monte carlo simulations in order to determine the density profiles as shown in figs.[fig : profile_ld ] and [ fig : profile_hd ] .",
    "as predicted by the mean field calculation , the constant bulk densities for the bound and unbound states are approached exponentially in the low and high density phases .",
    "the corresponding decay length @xmath121 is found to be the same for the bound and the unbound density and to diverge as one approaches the maximal current phase .",
    "some simulation results for the decay length @xmath121 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurve_l_r ] . in this case , the radius @xmath1 of the tube was varied while the boundary densities were kept fixed .",
    "the latter densities were chosen to be @xmath129 and @xmath130 which lies within the low density phase but is close to the phase transition line which separates the low from the high density phase",
    ". one surprising feature of the monte carlo data for the decay length @xmath121 is that they exhibit a pronounced _ minimum _ as a function of tube radius @xmath1 .",
    "for comparison , we also display in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurve_l_r ] the @xmath121values as obtained from several mean field approximations corresponding to the dashed , dotted and solid lines .",
    "the dashed line is obtained from the solution of equation ( [ e.xi ] ) which we derived from the continuous mean field approximation for the two  state model .",
    "we also determined this quantity using a lattice version of this approximation ( dotted line ) and a more elaborate mean field approximation ( solid line ) in which we solved the diffusion equation in the cylindrical compartment and matched this solution to the directed transport along the filament .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : kurve_l_r ] shows that all three mean field approximations are quite consistent with each other and lead to @xmath131 as follows from ( [ e.xi ] ) .",
    "such an increase of @xmath121 for large @xmath1 is in fair agreement with the monte carlo data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurve_l_r ] .",
    "however , in contrast to the monte carlo simulations , all three mean field approximations give a _ monotonic _ increase of @xmath121 with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the largest discrepancy between the mean field results and the monte carlo data is found in the limit of small @xmath1 for which one recovers the 1dimensional asep . in this limit",
    ", the monte carlo data should be quite reliable as one concludes from the value obtained for @xmath132 which is in very good agreement with the exact solution for the 1dimensional asep as given by @xcite @xmath133}\\ ] ] for @xmath134 in , ex .",

    "when bound to the filament , the motor particles undergo an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "in addition , motors can unbind from the filament and then diffuse freely in the tube . as for the asep in one dimension , the motor traffic in open tubes can exhibit three different phases : high density and low density phases which are characterized by an exponential decay of the density deviations from their bulk values and maximal current phases characterized by an algebraic decay .",
    "therefore , the molecular motor traffic in open tubes are promising candidates for the experimental observation of boundary  induced non  equilibrium phase transitions .    in general , the location of the transition lines is found to depend on the precise choice of the boundary conditions . apart from periodic boundary conditions , case ( a ) , we studied two different boundary conditions ( b ) and ( c ) for an open tube . in case",
    "( b ) , the bound and unbound densities are kept fixed at the boundaries and satisfy radial equilibrium . for this case , the location of the transition lines is independent of the model parameters , and the phase diagram of the asep in one dimension is recovered . in case ( c ) , the active compartment of the tube",
    "is bounded by two compartments where the transport is purely diffusive . in this latter case , the phase diagram depends on the geometry of the tube and on the transport properties in the bound and unbound motor states . in many cases , the maximal current phase is completely suppressed by the coupling to the diffusive compartments which act as bottle necks for the transport .",
    "the theoretical results described here should be accessible to experiments on cytoskeletal filaments and motors .",
    "in particular , the motor traffic through open tubes as discussed here provides new opportunities to study the transport properties of aseps by systematic experiments .",
