    "the emission in the mid - infrared ( mir ) band is mainly produced by dust heated either by the stars ( particularly during periods of strong star formation activity ) or by the emission originating in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . in several cases ,",
    "both causes contribute to the formation of the total spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the mir ( see , e.g. , polletta et al .",
    "2008 ; donley et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .    in recent years , _ xmm - newton_- and _ chandra_-based x - ray surveys have been able to delineate the density and evolution of x - ray unabsorbed and even moderately absorbed agn ( compton - thin ; n@xmath6=10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 @xmath9 ) up to redshift @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , ueda et al .",

    "the fraction of absorbed agn is observed to decrease with increasing luminosity ( e.g. , ueda et al . 2003 ; la franca et al . 2005 ; hasinger 2008 ; see also lawrence & elvis 1982 ) and to increase with increasing redshift ( la franca et al .",

    "is expected to contribute significantly to the mir sed , observations in the mir regime are potentially useful for selecting agn , including those which are undetected in the x - ray band .",
    "the launch of the _ spitzer _ telescope has allowed the construction of several large area multi - wavelength databases with mir coverage , such as ( for example ) the 9 deg@xmath3 noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) of the botes field ( murray et al . 2005 ) , the 3.7 deg@xmath3 extragalactic first look survey ( e - fls ; fadda et al .",

    "because of the faint optical fluxes these sources are difficult to spectroscopically identify in the optical , and , in fact , the agn classifications for this class of objects are mainly based on mir spectroscopy with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board _ spitzer _ ( e.g. , houck et al . 2005 ; weedman et al . 2006 ; yan et al 2007 ; brand et al . 2008 ) .",
