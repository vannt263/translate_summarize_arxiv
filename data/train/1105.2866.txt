    "quantum correlation arises from noncommutativity of operators representing states , observables , and measurements @xcite",
    ". quantum entanglement , which refers to the separability of the states , is very important in quantum information processing and can be realized in many kinds of physical systems which involve quantum correlation .",
    "quantum correlation seems to have been seldom exploited before .",
    "even many people take it for granted that quantum entanglement is quantum correlation .",
    "now we recognize that quantum entanglement is a special kind of quantum correlation , but not the same with quantum correlation .",
    "the most imperfect measurement of entanglement for an arbitrary two - qubit mixed state is the simple procedure derived by wootters @xcite .",
    "bell nonlocality is usually characterized by the violation of bell inequalities , which identify the entangled mixed state whose correlations can be reproduced by a classical local mode @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative classifications for correlations , which is based on quantum measurements , has arisen in recent years and also plays an important role in quantum information theory @xcite . in particular , quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite is introduced to measure these quantum correlations .",
    "there exists indeed separable mixed states having nonzero discord , and the separable mixed states can be used to perform useful quantum tasks @xcite .",
    "recently , some authors @xcite have pointed out that thermal quantum discord ( tqd ) , in contrast to entanglement and other thermodynamic quantities , spotlight the critical points associated with quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) for some spin chain model even at finite temperature @xmath0 .",
    "they think that the remarkable property of tqd is an important tool that can be readily applied to reduce the experimental demands to determine critical points for qpts .",
    "nevertheless , the evaluation of qd involves optimization procedure , and analytical results are known only in a few cases .",
    "daki@xmath1 @xcite _ et al_. introduce a geometrical measure of quantum discord ( gqd ) and derive an explicit expression for the case of two qubits .",
    "more recently , luo _ et al_. evaluate the gqd for an arbitrary state and obtain an explicit and tight lower bound , their results show qd actually coincides with a simpler quantity based on von neumann measurements @xcite .",
    "they think their simple and explicit bound makes qd a convenient and interesting tool for analyzing quantum correlations . unlike qd and gqd , luo @xcite introduced a classical vs quantum dichotomy in order to classify and quantify statistical correlations in bipartite states .",
    "they use measurement - induced disturbance ( mid ) to characterize correlations as classical or quantum . in a word ,",
    "bell nonlocality , entanglement and nonclassical correlations are different aspects of quantum correlations , it is desirable to compare these notions of quantum correlations .    in the past , many studies concentrate on entanglement properties of condensed matter systems and application in quantum communication and information .",
    "an important emerging field is the quantum entanglement in solid state systems such as spin chains .",
    "spin chains are the natural candidates for the realization of the entanglement compared with the other physical systems .",
    "the spin chains not only have useful applications such as the quantum state transfer , but also display rich entanglement features @xcite . the heisenberg chain , the simplest spin chain , has been used to construct a quantum computer and quantum dots @xcite . by suitable coding , the heisenberg interaction alone can be used for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the thermal entanglement , which requires neither measurement nor controlled switching of interactions in the preparing process , becomes an important quantity of systems for the purpose of quantum information .",
    "a lot of interesting work about thermal entanglement have been done @xcite .",
    "but quantum correlation in spin chains seems to have been seldom exploited before .",
    "it is very interesting and necessary to study the relation between quantum entanglement and various quantum correlations .",
    "moreover , the effects of external parameters on quantum correlation in spin chain also deserve to be investigated . in this paper",
    ", we will explore quantum correlation based on bell nonlocality , mid and gqd in two two - qubit models .",
    "the dependencies of spin - spin coupling , dm interaction and external magnetic field on quantum correlations are investigated .",
    "the comparison between quantum correlations and thermal entanglement measured by concurrence will be given .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we recall bell nonlocality , mid and gqd . in sec . 3",
    ", we will investigate these quantities and quantum entanglement measured by concurrence in two two - qubit spin models and give a detailed comparison .",
    "the effects of spin - spin coupling , dm interaction , and external magnetic field are illustrated .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "2.1 . bell nonlocality    it is known that all pure states violate bell - chsh inequalities whenever they are entangled . in the case of mixed state , for any two - level systems state",
    "@xmath2 we can apply the following criterion @xcite , let @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the eigenvalues of real symmetric matrix @xmath5 given by @xmath6 , the superscript @xmath7 denotes transpose of matrices , with @xmath8 , @xmath9tr@xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 are the three pauli matrices . then @xmath2 violates the bell - chsh inequalities if and only if @xmath12 . here",
    ", we use @xmath13 to quantify the capacity of the state @xmath2 to violate the bell - chsh inequality",
    "nonclassical correlation measured by mid    we can apply local measurement @xmath14(@xmath15 and @xmath16 ) to any bipartite state @xmath2 ( of course , including thermal state ) . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are complete projective measurements consisting of one - dimensional orthogonal projections for parties @xmath20 and @xmath21 . after the measurement , we get the state @xmath22 which is a classical state @xcite . if the measurement @xmath23 is induced by the spectral resolutions of the reduced states @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the measurement leaves the marginal information invariant and is in a certain sense the least disturbing .",
    "in fact , @xmath26 is a classical state that is closest to the original state @xmath2 since this kind of measurement can leave the reduced states invariant .",
    "one can use any reasonable distance between @xmath2 and @xmath26 to measure the quantum correlation in @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we will adopt luo s method @xcite , i.e. , quantum mutual information difference between @xmath2 and @xmath26 , to measure quantum correlation in @xmath2 . the total correlation in a bipartite state @xmath2",
    "can be well quantified by the quantum mutual information @xmath27 , and @xmath28 quantifies the classical correlations in @xmath2 since @xmath26 is a classical state . here",
    "@xmath29-tr@xmath2log@xmath2 denotes the von neumann entropy , and the logarithm is always understood as base @xmath30 in this paper .",
    "so the quantum correlation can be quantified by the measurement - induced disturbance @xmath31 .",
    "the non - orthogonal quantum states can not be distinguishied perfectly , one implication is that a simple projection measure by orthogonal basis will induce the collapse and decoherence of the measured non - orthogonal states .",
    "the resultant states are orthogonal and are similar as the classical case .",
    "the difference between initial and the finsal states can be understood as the quantum coherence . similarly for a bipartite system measured by corrrelated projection , the classical correlation in the resultant state can be remained . and",
    "mid can be understood as the quantum correlation .",
    "nonclassical correlation measured by gqd    the geometric measure of quantum discord(gqd ) quantifies the nonclassical correlation by using the nearest hillber - schmidt distance between the given state @xcite .",
    "for any two - qubit state @xmath32 $ ] , its geometric measure of quantum discord is evaluated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a column vector , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a matrix , and @xmath37 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath38 . here",
    "the superscript @xmath7 denotes transpose of vectors or matrices .",
    "entanglement quantified by concurrence    the entanglement of two qubits state @xmath2 can be measured by the concurrence @xmath39 which is written as @xmath40-\\sum^{4}_{i}\\lambda_{i}]$]@xcite , where @xmath41 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath42 , @xmath2 is the density matrix , @xmath43 and @xmath44 stands for the complex conjugate",
    ". the concurrence is available no matter whether @xmath2 is pure or mixed .",
    "in this section , we will investigate quantum correlations ( bell nonlocality , gqd , mid and concurrence ) in a two - qubit heigenberg _ xxz _",
    "spin model under an inhomogeneous magnetic field and in a two - qubit _ xxx _ spin model with dm anisotropic antisymmetric interaction .",
    "the effects of spin - spin coupling , dm interaction and external magnetic field on these prominent characteristics of quantum physics are illustrated .",
    "also , we will compare these quantities and demonstrate their different properties .",
    "first , we consider the model @xmath45 $ ] , here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the real coupling coefficients and @xmath48 are pauli spin operators .",
    "@xmath49 is restricted , and the magnetic fields on the two spins have been so parameterized that _",
    "b _ controls the degree of inhomogeneity .",

    "the thermal concurrence has been studied in ref.@xcite , here we mainly focus on bell nonlocality , gqd and mid .",
    "the comparison between various quantum correlations will be given . in the following",
    ", we will consider the thermal state of this system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 , which can be expressed @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath54tr@xmath55 is the partition function . for simplicity ,",
    "we write @xmath56 .",
    "we can obtain thermal state in the standard basis @xmath57 , which can be expressed as @xmath58 $ ] , with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62/\\eta$ ] , @xmath63 , @xmath64/\\eta$ ] , and @xmath65 .",

    "note that we work in units where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath50 and @xmath21 are dimensionless and @xmath0 is in unit of the boltzmann constant @xmath53 .    _",
    "_ case 1:__@xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "our model corresponds to an _ xxx _ spin model .",
    "we can easily obtain the relation between gqd and bell nonlocality as follows .",

    "figure 1 shows these quantities variation with respect to coupling strength @xmath46 .",
    "we can see that antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath69 can endure more quantum correlation .",
    "although for @xmath70 , there is no entanglement , gqd and mid exist .",
    "moreover , for some entangled states ( for example , @xmath71 , the system is in an entangled state ) , bell nonlocality can not be held @xmath72 .",
    "_ case 2 : _ _ xxz _ model with magnetic field . we know that in any solid state construction of qubits , there is always the possibility of inhomogeneous zeeman coupling .",
    "so it is necessary to investigate various quantum correlations s dependencies on magnetic field . in figure 2 and figure 3 , the plots of these four quantities with respect to nonuniform magnetic field and uniform magnetic field are given respectively .",
    "it is seen that bell nonlocality , mid and concurrence are symmetric with respect to the zero magnetic field , gqd is not a symmetric function about magnetic field .",
    "the introducing of antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath73 can excite more quantum correlations and entanglement .",
    "quantum correlations evolve alike except for bell nonlocality .",

    "we can see that bell nonlocality and gqd evolve similar but not the same which can be shown clearly from fig.5 .",

    "antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath69 can endure more quantum correlation .",
    "although for @xmath70 , there is no entanglement , gqd and mid exist .",
