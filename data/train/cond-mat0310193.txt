    "despite the large number of successful demonstrations of quantum coherent oscillations in individual @xcite and coupled @xcite josephson - junction qubits , quantitative understanding of the details of these oscillations is so far quite limited .",
    "one of the most important open problems is decoherence , many aspects of which still remain to be understood .",
    "the purpose of this work is to develop theoretical description of decoherence in dynamics of a system of two coupled qubits .",
    "the approach we are using is based on the evolution equation for the density matrix in the markovian approximation that is standard for description of weak decoherence . although there are indications from the single - qubit experiments that more sophisticated approaches are needed for quantitatively accurate description of decoherence , the result we obtain within the simple scheme can be useful as the benchmark for more elaborate models .",
    "motivation for studying decoherence in coupled qubits is provided by the recent experiment @xcite with two coupled charge qubits , where it was found that the decoherence rate for quantum coherent oscillations in two qubits at the optimal bias point is with good accuracy factor - of-4 larger than the decoherence rate in effectively decoupled qubits . an interesting question for theory is whether this factor - of-4 increase of the decoherence rate is a numerical coincidence , or it reflects some basic property of the decoherence mechanisms in charge qubits .",
    "as will become clear from the discussion below , the theory developed in this work favors `` numerical coincidence '' point of view .",
    "other aspects of decoherence in coupled qubits has been studied before numerically in @xcite .",
    "in general , it is well understood that decoherence rates of different states of two coupled qubits can be quite different if the random forces created by the qubit environments responsible for decoherence are completely or partially correlated at the two qubits .",
    "most importantly , in the case of complete correlation , the qubit system should have a `` decoherence - free subspace '' ( dfs ) spanned by the states @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite , since completely correlated external environments can not distinguish these states .",
    "in contrast , the subspace spanned by @xmath2 and @xmath3 experiences decoherence that is made stronger by the correlations between environmental forces acting on the two qubits . so the role of the quantitative theory in description of decoherence in the dynamics of coupled qubits is to see to what extent subspaces with different decoherence rates participate in the qubit oscillations for different methods of their excitation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system of two qubits coupled directly by interaction between the basis - forming degrees of freedom ( i.e. , electrostatic interaction through finite coupling capacitance for charge qubits , or magnetic interaction for flux qubits ) is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 s denote the pauli matrices , @xmath6 is the qubit interaction energy , @xmath7 is the tunnel amplitude and @xmath8 is the bias of the @xmath9th qubit .",
    "four energy levels of the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) are shown schematically in fig .  1 as functions of the common bias @xmath10 of the two qubits .",
    "in this work , we will consider quantum coherent oscillations in the qubits biased at the `` co - resonance '' point @xcite , where @xmath11 .",
    "such bias conditions are optimal for the oscillations .    it can be shown explicitly that the occupation probabilities of the qubit basis states ( that are of interest for us ) are insensitive to the phases of the qubit tunnel amplitudes @xmath7 , so without the loss of generality we will assume that @xmath7 s are real . the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) at the co - resonance reduces then to @xmath12 in the basis composed of eigenstates of the @xmath13 operators , the hamiltonian ( [ e2 ] ) can be diagonalized easily . eigenenergies and eigenstates",

    "as one can see explicitly from eqs .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , the average values @xmath34 of @xmath35 are vanishing in all states , so that there is no pure dephasing term in the evolution of the density matrix in our case . the fact that @xmath34 are vanishing can be related to the vanishing slope of the system energies with respect to variations of the bias in the vicinity of the co - resonance point ",
    "see fig .  1 . since all coefficients in the eigenfunctions ( [ e3 ] ) are real , the matrix elements @xmath29 are also real . for real @xmath29 , imaginary parts of the noise correlators @xmath36 in the second term on the right - hand - side of eqn .",

    "for instance , if the two qubits interact with different environments and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are uncorrelated , @xmath42 , whereas @xmath43 , if the qubits are acted upon by the force produced by one environment coupled equally to the two qubits . while the correlators @xmath44 and @xmath45 are necessarily real , @xmath39 can be imaginary , and @xmath46 .",
    "non - vanishing imaginary part of @xmath39 corresponds to the non - vanishing commutator @xmath47 $ ] and implies that the two qubits are coupled to the two non - commuting variables of the same reservoir . while this is probably not very likely for qubits with the basis - forming degrees of freedom of the same nature ( which in a typical situation should be coupled to the same set of environmental degrees of freedom ) , the non - vanishing @xmath48 should be typical if the qubits have different basis - forming variables . using the spectral decomposition of the correlators @xmath49 and swartz inequality , one can prove ( similarly to what is done in a different context of linear quantum measurements @xcite ) that for arbitrary stationary reservoirs the correlators satisfy the inequality that imposes the constraint on @xmath50 : @xmath51 if the reservoirs are in equilibrium at temperature @xmath52 , the correlators satisfy also the standard detailed balance relations : @xmath53    equation ( [ e7 ] ) with the noise correlators ( [ e8 ] ) govern weakly dissipative time evolution of the two coupled qubits in a generic situation .",
    "below we use them to determine decoherence properties of quantum coherent oscillations of the qubits . before doing this , however , we would like to briefly discuss applicability of our approach to realistic josephson - junction qubits . as we saw above , one of the main features of eqn .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) is that the pure dephasing terms disappear at the co - resonance point and remaining decoherence is related to transitions between the energy eigenstates .",
    "this implies that within the approach based on eqn .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , the decoherence rates are on the order of half of the transition rates , whereas experiments with charge qubits ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that decoherence rates are larger than the transition rates even at the optimum bias point when the pure - dephasing terms should disappear .",
    "apparently , this is related to the low - frequency charge noise @xcite that is coupled to qubit strongly enough for the lowest - order perturbation theory in coupling ( [ e5 ] ) to be insufficient .",
    "this implies that the theory presented in this work might be only qualitatively correct for realistic charge qubits , for which one should develop more accurate non - perturbative description of the low - frequency noise to achieve quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "our simple perturbative approach , however , should be applicable to flux qubits , where the low - frequency noise should not be as strong as in the charge qubits .",
    "one of the most direct ways of excitation of quantum coherent oscillations in individual or coupled qubits that will be discussed in this work is based on the abrupt variation of the bias conditions @xcite .",
    "if the qubits are initially localized in one of their basis states , e.g. @xmath2 , and abrupt variation of the bias brings them to the co - resonance point , the probabilities for the qubits to be in other basis states start oscillating with time . in the simplest detection scheme ( realized , for instance , in experiment @xcite ) the probability for each qubit to be in the state @xmath54",
