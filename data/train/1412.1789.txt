    "* hereafter mlt ) has proven rather successful despite presenting a very simple description of convection . in this picture , the condition that distinguishes between convective and stable layers is the schwarzschild criterion , and the convective efficiency , the ratio of convective and radiative fluxes , is computed from local quantities . in the super - adiabatic convective layers that define the atmosphere of most stars , the predicted convective efficiency is very sensitive to the underlying model describing the radiative energy losses , the lifetime , and the geometrical shape of individual convective structures .",
    "these quantities are not well constrained by the mlt and must be calibrated from observations .    in recent years",
    ", three dimensional ( 3d ) radiation hydrodynamical ( rhd ) simulations have provided predictions for the surface convection that are in very good agreement with the observed solar granulation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , various studies relied on 3d rhd simulations to improve the predicted photospheric structures and spectroscopic abundance determinations for the sun and other stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to a better representation of the surface inhomogeneities , 3d model atmospheres feature non - local effects , such as the so - called top overshoot layers , which are completely missing in local 1d mlt models @xcite .    the deep convection zone , where the stratification becomes essentially adiabatic , is not sensitive to the convection model .",
    "it is however the entropy jump in the super - adiabatic layers that completely defines the asymptotic entropy value of the deep , adiabatically stratified structure , hence also the depth of the convection zone .",
    "one possibility to model these layers is to rely on rhd simulations to determine the asymptotic entropy value for the deep convection zone @xcite .",
    "this arises from the prediction that upflows formed at the base of the convection zone follow an adiabat almost up to the visible surface @xcite .",
    "the 1d mlt envelopes are then calibrated from the multi - dimensional asymptotic entropy , a technique that has been employed for late - type stars and giants @xcite .",
    "the calibrated 1d structures nevertheless neglect the overshoot layers predicted at the base of non - local convection zones @xcite , which for deep convective envelopes , impacts the convective mixing into the nuclear burning core . in this work ,",

    "surface granulation in da white dwarfs is qualitatively very similar to that seen in the sun and stars @xcite , albeit with shorter lifetimes and smaller characteristic sizes , which are roughly inversely proportional to gravity .",
    "convective instabilities due to hydrogen recombination develop in the atmosphere of these pure - hydrogen stellar remnants at @xmath4  k , although convective energy fluxes only become significant at @xmath5  k for @xmath6 .",
    "the convection zone eventually grows to sub - photospheric , and essentially adiabatic layers , at slightly lower effective temperatures .",
    "white dwarfs in the range @xmath7 ( k ) @xmath8 have super - adiabatic photospheric layers where the 1d mlt parameterization has a strong influence on the predicted thermal structures and spectra @xcite . @xcite recently demonstrated that the local 1d mlt is unable to reproduce the mean photospheric structure of 3d simulations , and that shortcomings in the 1d mlt are responsible for the spurious high @xmath9 values previously derived from spectroscopic observations of cool convective white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in particular , the top overshoot region was found to have a crucial impact on the spectroscopic predictions .",
    "the convection zone in da white dwarfs remains limited to the thin hydrogen envelope until it reaches the degenerate core at @xmath10  k , or mixes with the underlying helium layer if the total gravitationally stratified mass of hydrogen is less than about @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "before one of these events takes place , the cooling process is regulated by the radiative interface layer just above the largely isothermal degenerate core , which is in some sense the bottle - neck for the energy transport .",
    "the evolutionary calculations converge to the so - called radiative zero solution , hence they are insensitive to the details of the convection model @xcite , which is unlike earlier evolutionary stages ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the situation is different below @xmath12  k , where the cooling rates are directly impacted by the convecting coupling between the interior thermal reservoir and the radiating surface . in this temperature range",
    ", however , the super - adiabatic peak has a negligible amplitude , or in other words , the full convection zone has an essentially adiabatic structure which does not depend on the mlt parameterization . as a consequence ,",
    "the cooling ages predicted from current 1d evolutionary sequences are not expected to be impacted by 3d effects .",

    "we cover at least @xmath243 pressure scale heights ( @xmath25 ) below the unstable regions when the bottom of the simulation is closed to mass flows .",
    "the physical conditions at the bottom of convection zones can be extracted from 3d simulations even if we do not simulate the full zones .",
    "we rely on the technique presented in @xcite , for which a demonstration is shown in figure  [ fg : f_exemple ] for a da simulation at @xmath26  k and @xmath6 .",
    "we present the local 3d values of the entropy in convective structures ( black dots ) as a function of geometrical depth with the stellar surface on the right - hand side .",

    "keep an imprint of the physical conditions at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the averaged 3d entropy , on the other hand , is not a conserved quantity due to radiative losses and the presence of downdrafts created in the photosphere .",
    "the above technique only applies if the center of upflows remains adiabatic , hence a minimum requirement is that the conditions at the bottom of the convection zone are adiabatic .",
    "we have observed that the adiabatic transition takes place when the bottom of the convection zone reaches layers deeper than @xmath28 .",
    "for all of our simulations with an open bottom , we can recover an asymptotic value .",
    "for closed simulations , there is no significant entropy plateau since conditions are never adiabatic , although in those cases we can directly extract the properties at the bottom of the convection zones .",
    "we also overlay in figure  [ fg : f_exemple ] the 1d model atmosphere with the mlt calibrated from a comparison of @xmath27 with a grid of 1d envelopes ( see section 4.2 ) . the 1d model atmospheres and envelopes calibrated",

    "there is no guarantee that the calibrated 1d models will provide a good match to the mean 3d stratification in super - adiabatic layers .",
    "fortunately , in the case of white dwarfs in contrast to main - sequence stars , the super - adiabatic layers have little direct impact on applications that require the use of 1d envelopes . as it was custom until now , it is generally sufficient to employ 1d envelopes where the mlt parameterization is based on the deep layers , and rely on a different set of models , e.g. 3d simulations , for atmospheric parameter determinations .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ fg : f_exemple ] demonstrates that if needed , a connection of the 1d and mean 3d structures at large depth could also be a fairly good approximation .      for the purpose of this work , we computed 1d envelopes relying on the mlt for the treatment of convection , similar to those presented in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "clearly , the mlt parameterization has a strong effect on the size and mass included in the convection zone at intermediate temperatures , where the atmospheric layers are super - adiabatic .    to ensure that we share a common entropy zero point in all calculations , we computed all entropy values using the same eos as the 3d simulations , based on the @xcite non - ideal eos , where we have also accounted for partial degeneracy .",
    "the entropy values at the bottom of the convection zone are shown in figure  [ fg : f_entropy ] ( solid lines ) , along with additional sequences where we have neglected partial degeneracy ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the degeneracy effects are very small in the convection zone ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the chemical potential of the free electrons ) .",

    "we use 250 snapshots in the last 25% of a simulation to make the temporal average .",

    "for cool convective white dwarfs ( @xmath63 k , @xmath6 ) with deep convection zones , entropy fluctuations are smaller in the photosphere and the dominant role of the downflows is diminished . the descending fluid form a hierarchical structure of merging downdrafts due to the increase of the pressure scale height with depth @xcite .    in the 3d simulations , downdrafts at the base of the convection zone ( according to the schwarzschild criterion ) still have large momenta .",
    "they are also denser than the ambient medium , albeit with a decreasing difference . as a consequence ,",

    "the momentum of the downdrafts remains significant , hence they penetrate into even deeper layers .",
    "this is the beginning of the convective overshoot region , although some authors prefer the term convective penetration @xcite when the convective flux is still energetically relevant . in these layers ,",
    "convective structures are decelerated since they have a density deficit .",
    "downdrafts are generally warmer than the ambient medium and they carry a net downwards ( negative ) convective flux , or in other words , the temperature gradient in these layers is larger than the radiative gradient .",
    "that follows from the change of sign of the velocity - enthalpy correlation .",
    "however , figure  [ fg : f_flux ] demonstrates that this negative overshoot flux is always a small fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the total flux .",
    "once the convective flux has decreased by one order of magnitude , or to a value of less than 1% of the total flux , the energetic impact on the structure becomes very small .    the negative convective flux and velocities decay in a similar exponential way below the flux boundary , both with a scale height close to @xmath25 .",
    "while the convective flux becomes rapidly energetically negligible , the convective velocities still have mixing capabilities in much deeper layers .",

    "one should be cautious since an inspection of figure  [ fg : f_flux ] for 1d model atmospheres calibrated for the flux boundary ( blue dashed lines ) reveals that while the zero point of convective flux is by definition in agreement with the 3d simulations , the overall shape of the @xmath35 convective flux is not very well reproduced for shallow convection zones .",
    "our calibration of ml2/@xmath31 is mostly useful to characterize the depth at which convection becomes energetically insignificant and the velocities start to decay exponentially with geometrical depth .",

    "the previous discussion applies most generally to white dwarfs with shallow convection zones .    for the very warm simulations ,",
    "e.g. 13,500 and 14,000  k at @xmath9 = 8.0 , the schwarzschild and flux boundaries are essentially in the photosphere ( @xmath71 ) , and therefore the ml2/@xmath31 value for these layers becomes coupled with the mlt parameterization used in spectroscopic applications ( tl13c ) . both 3d simulations and 1d models show new patterns in this @xmath16 regime .",

    "this flux remains large near the mean schwarzschild boundary since cool downdrafts get convectively stable at larger geometrical depths than the upflows . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean total flux becomes negative slightly above the mean schwarzschild boundary .",
    "we have verified that there is no reversal of the flux and schwarzschild boundaries when the kinetic energy flux is neglected .",
    "the mlt does not account for the kinetic energy flux , hence we do not expect a similar reversal in 1d .    for convective 1d models at large @xmath16 ,",
    "the size of the unstable regions becomes insensitive to the mlt parameterization according to figure  [ fg : f_t_top ] , hence it is not possible to calibrate the mlt based on the schwarzschild boundary .",
    "this picture is somewhat misleading since the mlt convective fluxes , and associated velocities , remain very sensitive to the value of the mlt parameters",
    ". figure  [ fg : f_t_top ] shows that the 1d convective flux drops to very small values ( @xmath72 , dotted lines ) much higher in the photosphere than the 1d schwarzschild boundary .",
    "our results would naively suggest that convective efficiency increases with @xmath16 but the 3d simulations present a more complex picture . at high @xmath16 ,",
    "non - local effects from strong and deep reaching downdrafts create @xmath36 flux profiles that are extended and smoother as a function of geometrical depth than in the 1d case , both at the top and bottom of the convection zone .",
    "in figure  [ fg : f_fmax ] , we have calibrated ml2/@xmath31 in order to reproduce the maximum value of the @xmath36 convective flux , which peaks in the photosphere , for shallow convection zones . clearly , a much smaller mixing - length parameter is necessary to match the @xmath36 convective flux in the photosphere in comparison to the schwarzschild or flux boundaries .",
    "the values of ml2/@xmath31 = 0.6 - 0.8 are consistent with the commonly used spectroscopic parameterizations ( tl13c ) .",
    "nevertheless , the parameterizations for the schwarzschild and flux boundaries offer a better representation of the conditions at the bottom of the convection zones .",
    "we have already discussed the fact that the convection zone is drastically deeper when defined in terms of the @xmath35 convective velocities .",
    "this is also seen in figures  [ fg : f_t_top ] and [ fg : f_p_top ] where we show the position of the one order of magnitude decrease for @xmath68 below the flux boundary ( open triangles ) .",
    "it is inappropriate to parameterize the 1d mlt for the highly non - local overshoot velocities , and it would produce spurious stratifications in the unstable regions . instead , we propose an overshoot parameterization that does not directly involve the mlt in section  5.2 .      for open 3d simulations , we have extracted the asymptotic entropy values @xmath27 characterizing the deep adiabatic layers using the technique described in section  2.2 .",
    "@xmath27 is directly derived from the specified entropy of the ascending material at the bottom boundary of the simulations .",
    "we have verified that this matches the observed asymptotic value below the photosphere ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fg : f_exemple ] ) .",
    "we then assume that @xmath27 also corresponds to the entropy value at the bottom of the unstable layers in 1d envelopes .",
    "the @xmath27 and 1d entropy values are compared in figure  [ fg : f_entropy ] for the @xmath6 case .",
    "the calibration of ml2/@xmath31 is directly performed from a match of @xmath27 with entropy values interpolated from the grid of 1d envelopes . in figure",
    "[ fg : f_mass ] , we show the resulting hydrogen mass integrated from the surface .    at low temperatures ( @xmath73  k at @xmath6 )",
    ", da white dwarfs have extremely small super - adiabatic atmospheric layers , and the structure remains essentially adiabatic from the bottom to the top of the convection zone . since the top of the convection zone is higher than the photosphere ( @xmath74 ) , the effective temperature directly identifies the entropy value at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the choice of the mlt parameterization does not matter since there is no significant radiative energy exchange during one advective ( turnover ) timescale .",
    "figure  [ fg : f_xmlt ] ( top panel ) presents the mlt parameterization for the lower part of the convection zone in order to recover the schwarzschild boundary ( hereafter ml2/@xmath75 ) of the 70 3d simulations in our grid .",
    "we illustrate with different symbols the calibration derived directly from closed 3d simulations ( open circles ) and inferred from a match of @xmath27 ( filled squares ) .",
    "we also present in figure  [ fg : f_xmlt ] ( bottom panel ) the calibration matching the @xmath36 flux boundary ( hereafter ml2/@xmath76 ) .",
    "the latter calibration is directly performed for closed simulations , and in those cases , @xmath76 is 16% larger than @xmath75 with a relatively small dispersion of 3% .",
    "therefore , we simply assume that ml2/@xmath77 for open 3d simulations .",
    "this is likely a good approximation in the transition region between closed and open 3d simulations , and at lower @xmath70 , the 1d envelopes depend less critically on the mlt parameterization .",
    "the calibration is not performed when the 1d mass included within the convection zone varies by an amount smaller than 0.2 dex for the range of ml2@xmath69 between 0.4 and 2.0 .",
    "this defines the upper and lower @xmath16 boundaries in figure  [ fg : f_xmlt ] , which depend on @xmath9 . at the cool end",
    ", we propose to keep ml2/@xmath31 constant , since the value is irrelevant for structure calculations .",
    "similarly , at @xmath16 values above those in the calibration range , it is likely acceptable to keep the value constant for most applications .",
    "the choice of the asymptotic ml2/@xmath31 value is not obvious , however , because of its rapid variation with @xmath70 . as a compromise",
    ", we adopt values of 1.2 and 1.4 , for ml2/@xmath75 and ml2/@xmath76 , respectively , at @xmath16 values larger than our calibration range .",
    "if one is interested in the detailed properties of shallow convection zones above @xmath78  k at @xmath9 = 8.0 , it may be preferable to combine the @xmath36 and 1d structures at some depth below the convection zone where the convective flux is negligible .",
    "the mlt does not reproduce very well the extended but inefficient 3d convection zones in this regime . for @xmath16 values above our calibration range",
    ", most of the 3d effects will be from the overshoot at the base of the convection zone since contrary to the small convective fluxes , velocities remain significant well below the photosphere .",
    "table  2 provides the tabulated mlt parameterizations , which are valid for 1d envelopes with an eos , opacities , and boundary conditions similar to those employed for our grid .",
    "physical conditions at the bottom of our calibrated envelopes ( mass , temperature , and pressure ) are also given as a reference point . moreover , we propose fitting functions for ml2/@xmath75 and ml2/@xmath76 , respectively , where the independent variables are defined as    @xmath79 } - 8.0 ~,\\ ] ]    @xmath80 } -12000)/1000 - 1.6g_{0 } ~,\\ ] ]    and the functions are as follow with numerical coefficients found in table  3    @xmath81 ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "similarly to our 3d atmospheric parameter corrections in tl13c , we have adopted functions that do not retain the fine details of the 3d and 1d differences .",
    "small scale fluctuations may be due to inaccuracies in the grid of 3d simulations .",
    "ultimately , the calibrated 1d structures do not provide the detailed @xmath36 convective flux profile and neglect the turbulent nature of convection .",
    "it is not well constrained how much these 3d effects impact chemical diffusion and pulsation calculations .",
    "finally , we remind the reader that 1d structure codes typically make approximations for the non - gray radiative transfer in the atmospheres , which may introduce a slight offset in the size of convection zones .",
    "the ml2/@xmath31 offset is at most a few percent for our setup ( see section 2.3 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we believe that a calibration within 5% is sufficient .",
