    "bounds on higher - order non - gaussian contributions to the observed and approximately gaussian temperature anisotropy map of the cosmic microwave background are rapidly entering a phase where they can be used to constrain and sometimes even rule out certain ( exotic ) models of inflation .",
    "for instance , bounds on the amplitude of the cmb three - point function , or bispectrum , have already narrowed down the parameter range of string inspired dirac - born infeld models of inflation .    in a separate development",
    "it was recently shown that modifications to the inflationary vacuum state can also result in significantly enhanced non - gaussian signals @xcite .",
    "in particular the bispectrum can reveal enhanced features that essentially arise due to interactions between excited quanta in the modified vacuum .",
    "the power spectrum is also sensitive to deviations from the bunch - davies vacuum , but there the corrections are suppressed by the bogoliubov parameter , whose magnitude is small and typically related to the inflationary hubble parameter divided by the scale of new physics , which is already constrained to be smaller than @xmath0 @xcite . for the bispectrum",
    "one instead encounters an additional enhancement factor , independent of the bogoliubov parameter , that is in fact proportional to the scale where effective field theory is supposed to break down .",
    "the appearance of this enhancement factor can be traced back to the new physics hypersurface ( nph ) used to define the modified vacuum state . the higher the cut - off scale representing new physics , the more time the fields have before they cross the horizon and freeze , and the more time the interactions effectively have to generate a significant non - gaussian contribution .",
    "this also implies that the ( decoupling ) limit of taking the cut - off scale to infinity in a modified vacuum is in general ill - defined , producing an infinite bispectrum , whereas the power spectrum yields the standard result in this decoupling limit ( assuming the bogoliubov parameter is suppressed by one over the cut - off scale ) .    in this work",
    "the most recent bispectrum constraints will be applied to a particular and arguably the simplest model of vacuum state corrections , which was first considered in @xcite , but constructed and applied more generally by danielsson @xcite .",
    "we will derive to what extent this vacuum state model can be ruled out by the bispectrum data alone in two particular scenarios ; a slow - roll single field inflationary model with a higher derivative operator representing the interactions and a non - canonical single field model with a small speed of sound . the bispectrum prediction for a general ( nph ) vacuum state modification in these single - field models was computed in @xcite .",
    "as an important and hopefully illuminating illustration we will slightly extend and improve the analysis , and apply it to the specific vacuum state proposal of danielsson .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will start with a quick review and small generalization of the danielsson vacuum state proposal , followed by a summary of the results for the bispectrum in the context of a vacuum state modification in general single - field models of inflation .",
    "we then explain how these results can be turned into an _",
    "upper bound _ on the scale of new physics and to what extent this vacuum state proposal is ruled out or not .",
    "we end with some conclusions and prospects for future improvement of the bounds .",
    "let us begin with a short review of danielsson s original proposal for a modified vacuum state , under the natural assumption that a high energy cut - off scale @xmath1 exists beyond which effective field theory breaks down @xcite .",
    "solving for the mode functions in an inflating ( pure de sitter ) background one writes down solutions for the field and conjugate momentum operators in terms of creation and annihilation operators in the standard way .",
    "now identify a ( conformal ) time @xmath2 serving as the initial time where one would like to define the vacuum state .",
    "this initial time @xmath2 is related to the cut - off @xmath3 by demanding that the physical momentum at @xmath2 equals the cut - off scale , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "this ensures that the description is always within the effective field theory regime .",
    "note that since we are imposing a cut - off on the physical momentum the initial time @xmath2 is necessarily a function of the comoving momentum @xmath5 .",
    "with respect to this initial time @xmath2 the creation operators ( and subsequently the annihilation operators ) can then be expressed as @xmath6 describing nothing else but the mixing of creation and annihilation operators as time progresses . to ensure the time - independent commutation relations for the creation- and annihilation operators",
    "requires that @xmath7 .",
    "let us now define a natural candidate for a vacuum state at some initial conformal time @xmath2 @xmath8 obviously this choice requires that @xmath9 vanishes at @xmath10 and as a direct consequence this candidate vacuum corresponds to a minimal uncertainty state at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this choice of vacuum can be understood as selecting the ` local ' empty state at the time the physical momentum equals the high - energy cut - off @xmath3 .",
    "this time will be different for different comoving momenta and defines a so - called ` new physics hypersurface ' .",
    "it can therefore be viewed as the vacuum state that is closest to the bunch - davies state in the presence of a high - energy cut - off and can in that sense be regarded as a minimal modification .    to understand the relation of this choice of vacuum to the standard bunch - davies state , consider the field operator which should be proportional to the sum of the creation and annihilation operators . in terms of mode - function solutions to the equations of motion @xmath11",
    "this implies that @xmath12 where the overall ( real ) normalization @xmath13 is fixed by the klein - gordon normalization condition .",
    "similarly , the expression for the canonical momentum operator defines a function @xmath14 , which is proportional to the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath16 using these relations one can derive the following expression for the function @xmath9 in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 \\ , .",
    "\\label{vkeqn}\\ ] ] defining a vacuum state @xmath20 is now explicitly seen to be equivalent to picking a mode - function solution @xmath17 ( and its canonically conjugate function @xmath18 ) such that @xmath9 vanishes at some @xmath10 .",
    "bunch - davies mode - functions have the property that @xmath9 only vanishes in the limit @xmath21 , i.e. the bunch - davies state in this class of vacua corresponds to the minimal uncertainty vacuum state in the infinite past .",
    "now let us instead consider the general solution , which can be constructed from the bunch - davies mode - function and its complex conjugate @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are complex coefficients satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , the momentum mode - function @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the bunch - davies momentum mode - functions @xmath26 to find the natural candidate vacua at some fixed time @xmath2 one demands that @xmath27 . using ( [ vkeqn ] )",
    "this gives the following expression for the bogoliubov rotation parameter @xmath28 in terms of the bunch - davies field and momentum mode - functions @xmath29 in terms of the ( bunch - davies ) functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 that appear in the expression for the annihilation and creation operators ( [ aauv ] ) the result simply reads @xmath32 a couple of comments are in order .",
    "since the ( late time ) power spectrum of fluctuations is proportional to @xmath33 , the bogoliubov rotation parameter @xmath34 denotes the leading order correction to the power spectrum due to a vacuum state modification.scale invariant vacuum states of course require that @xmath34 is independent of the comoving momentum @xmath5 , which will be guaranteed by the relation @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath2 is @xmath5-dependent .",
    "also note that this minimal cut - off vacuum construction has so far been completely general , not depending on any details of the inflationary lagrangian .",
    "whatever inflationary model one is interested in , to construct these states and determine the bogoliubov parameter @xmath34 one simply plugs in the relevant ( mode- ) functions in the inflationary case of interest .",
    "the best known ( and originally discussed ) example is that of the massless scalar field , that is associated to standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "the bunch - davies field and momentum mode - function in that case read @xmath36 using the expression ( [ betamodefn ] ) or ( [ betauv ] ) one then derives the following expression for the bogoliubov parameter @xmath34 @xmath37 since @xmath38 this bogoliubov parameter is indeed scale invariant and approximates to @xmath39 .",
    "as we have emphasized , the construction of these minimal cut - off states is completely general and can just as well be applied in the context of small speed of sound models of inflation , which includes dbi inflation as a special class .",
    "one might suggest that in non - canonical models of inflation the introduction of a cut - off scale is not required , since an infinite number of higher order corrections have been resummed leading to the non - canonical kinetic term . however , these corrections are only a subset of all the possible higher - dimensional operators that are expected to contribute as the string- ( or cut - off ) scale is approached , motivating the general introduction of a cut - off scale .",
    "so the main , and for our purposes only , difference between small speed of sound and slow - roll models of inflation is the introduction of a reduced ( and assumed constant ) speed of sound @xmath40 of the inflaton fluctuations . for the bunch - davies functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 one can check that the only effect is the appearance of a single factor of the speed of sound @xmath43 in the @xmath44 terms as compared to the standard slow - roll case .",
    "the end - result for the bogoliubov parameter therefore reads @xmath45 which translates into the scale - invariant approximate expression @xmath46 .",
    "one observes that the ratio @xmath47 governing the magnitude of the corrections in standard slow - roll is modified to @xmath48 in these models , which could be orders of magnitude bigger .",
    "note that the length scale @xmath49 corresponds to the sound horizon in small speed of sound models , corresponding to the length scale at which the behavior of the mode - functions turns non - adiabatic .",
    "the appearance of the factor @xmath50 is a general feature in these models , which was for instance also observed for the enhancement factors in the three - point function that appear whenever one introduces an arbitrary modified initial state at some high - energy cut - off .",
    "we conclude that the same is true for the bogoliubov parameter in cut - off modified initial state proposals : the magnitude ( and phase ) depends on the combination @xmath50 which results in larger absolute values of the bogoliubov parameter for the same value of the cut - off and inflationary hubble parameter , as compared to standard slow - roll models .",
    "this ends our short summary of minimal cut - off initial states .",
    "the results for the three - point function , as reported in @xcite , were model - independent in the sense that they only relied on the presence of a physical momentum cut - off .",
    "the bogoliubov parameter was left as a free parameter and general bounds were derived on its magnitude for different inflationary lagrangians . in this work",
    "we would like to specifically constrain the minimal cut - off modified vacuum state models for which we will need the expressions for the bogoliubov parameters derived above .",
    "as already referred to , in our previous work we calculated the results for the three - point function under the assumption of an arbitrary scale - invariant initial state modification in the nph framework .",
    "the presence of a physical high - energy momentum cut - off was assumed , which identified an initial time for each comoving momentum mode where the initial state was defined by introducing a @xmath5-independent , but undetermined , bogoliubov parameter .",
    "the presence of such a cut - off alone already has major consequences for the three - point function , also known as the bispectrum in fourier space . whenever the bogoliubov parameter is non - zero ,",
    "particles are injected at the initial ( cut - off ) time , which allows potential ( self- ) interactions to generate a large bispectrum amplitude at the time of horizon crossing . in the calculations",
    "these effects show up as large enhancement factors that depend on powers of @xmath51 . depending on the details of the inflationary model under consideration the power of the enhancement factor could be as large as three , resulting in a huge bispectrum amplitude .",
    "the only reason why these large non - gaussian signals have not yet been detected or ruled out is their specific ( oscillatory ) shape , which is orthogonal to any of the non - gaussian templates used in analyzing the cmb data so far .",
    "proposals for better adapted templates and improved methods to detect or constrain these oscillatory non - gaussian signals have recently been put forward @xcite , but have not yet been applied to the available data , forcing us to concentrate on the standard non - gaussian shapes that have been constrained .",
    "projecting the large bispectrum onto any one of the available templates still allows one to derive reasonable constraints in general .",
    "in fact , in some cases the constraints are already stronger than those available from the power spectrum . before discussing the results of the projections to the observational templates",
    "it should be pointed out that in principle the results only apply to the three - dimensional bispectrum . however , in general the changes resulting from the reduction to the two - dimensional sphere are minimal and can ( partially ) be taken into account by introducing a weight function in the three - dimensional analysis @xcite .    for models with a small speed of sound ( @xmath52 ) the projections to the local and orthogonal templates @xcite , including the phase ,",
    "were computed analytically @xcite . to derive these results",
    "the assumption was made that the modifications to the bd state were strictly oriented in the @xmath53 direction , introducing a constant @xmath54 parameter , breaking the symmetry between the different momenta in the triangle .",
    "properly maintaining the symmetry would instead require introducing three constant parameters @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the direction in which one has perturbed the bd vacuum state via a bogolyubov transformation .",
    "consequently , one can factor out the constant @xmath55 for each perturbed state @xmath57 .",
    "as expected , the results of this more complete analysis that preserves the symmetry between triangle momenta differ only slightly .",
    "moreover , we have ameliorated our ( numerical ) integration methods and used the improved definition of the inner product between shapes as proposed by @xcite , which introduces a weight function to simulate projection effects onto the 2d cmb sky .",
    "this increases the correlation between smooth and oscillating shapes as oscillations are slightly damped by the weight function .",
    "general single field models are defined by a single ( lagrangian ) function @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . from this function",
    "@xmath58 expressions can be derived for the slow - roll parameters , the speed of sound and two other variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whose ratio @xmath62 will appear in the three - point function @xcite . introducing a modified nph vacuum state the final enhancement factor in the projections",
    "turns out to be at best quadratic in @xmath63 .",
    "the results , for an undetermined bogoliubov parameter @xmath64 , in the limit that @xmath65 and @xmath66 is @xmath67 the additional terms that have been neglected are subleading in @xmath68 and are out of phase in the sense that the phase parameter @xmath69 is shifted with @xmath70 .",
    "also note that these results do not reduce to the standard slow - roll results in the @xmath71 limit .",
    "subdominant terms that have been neglected in the @xmath52 limit will turn in to the dominant contributions to the bispectrum in the @xmath72 limit , explaining why the @xmath72 limit of the above result does not reproduce the slow - roll bispectrum .",
    "it is also important to stress that the dbi models are a special class of small sound speed models for which @xmath73 and as a result the leading contributions to the bispectrum cancel exactly @xcite .",
    "the remaining contributions to the projections of the dbi modified nph initial state bispectrum are only linearly enhanced in the small @xmath43 limit and the details of the projections in the dbi case can only be evaluated semi - analytically @xcite .",
    "this leads to dbi constraints that are far less interesting as compared to general small sound speed models .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on the general models and not discuss the dbi results in detail .    in the case of standard canonical single - field slow - roll inflation with a specific dimension @xmath74 higher - derivative term @xcite the enhancement factor appearing in the bispectrum amplitude",
    "was found to be quadratic in @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "however , in the projection to the available observational templates @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the projection factor , one looses one power of the enhancement , leaving a linear enhancement in @xmath75 as far as the projections are concerned .",
    "in addition the amplitude of the enhancement is further reduced by slow - roll ( via @xmath78 ) and the dimensionful coupling of the higher - derivative term . in these results",
    "the effects of a ( cut - off dependent ) phase in the bogoliubov parameter was neglected and for our purposes here we would like to remedy this situation . to incorporate the phase we had to rely on numerical methods to determine the projection factors . for the projection onto local non - gaussianities we obtain ( in the limit of large @xmath79 ) @xmath80 which",
    ", not surprisingly , is very similar to equation ( @xmath81 ) in @xcite , except for the appearance of a phase dependence .",
    "it is important to realize that the inclusion of the perturbative effect of the dimension @xmath74 higher - derivitive operator is only consistent when @xmath82 @xcite , which translates into @xmath83 .",
    "the power spectrum observations tell us that @xmath84 , which implies that @xmath85 to ensure a consistent higher - derivative expansion . as a consequence the non - gaussianities due to the presence of the dimension @xmath74 higher - derivative term reach a maximal magnitude for @xmath86 , yielding an equilateral amplitude of at most @xmath87 . on the other hand , modifying the initial state leads to an additional enhancement factor that is proportional to the ratio between the uv cutoff @xmath3 and the scale of inflation @xmath88 .",
    "the required consistency of the higher - derivative expansion , being inversely proportional to the cut - off scale @xmath3 , reduces this enhancement and as a consequence weakens the constraints on @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the next section , for the minimal cut - off vacuum state proposal assumed in this paper the constraint becomes practically meaningless .",
    "this should not come as much of a surprise , since in order to boost non - gaussianities from higher - derivative operators the cut - off scale needs to be relatively close to the inflationary scale , whereas the non - gaussian amplitude as a consequence of initial state modifications grows as the the hierarchy between the cut - off and the hubble scale increases . for completeness ,",
    "let us remark that the correlation between the orthogonal template and the standard single - field higher - derivative bispectrum , being very similar , yields comparable constraints .",
    "after this very short review and slight improvement of what is known about bispectrum projections due to a generic nph initial state , let us now derive the best available constraints on the parameters of minimal cut - off initial states .",
    "having summarized the results for minimal cut - off initial states and the general projected non - gaussian amplitudes due to arbitrary cut - off ( or nph ) modified vacua , we would now like to apply the most recent observational bounds to derive constraints on the parameters of the minimal cut - off initial state proposal .    to proceed",
    "we will make use of the following recent ( 2 @xmath90 ) constraints on @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite @xmath93 the observational constraints on the equilateral amplitude @xmath94 can be ignored , because the projection to the equilateral template turns out to be orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "one should keep in mind that the power spectrum constraint on @xmath95 is roughly @xmath0 , which is based on the lack of evidence for oscillatory behavior with a larger amplitude in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of the results for the projections is that they oscillate as a function of the phase @xmath69 of the bogoliubov parameter ( [ eq : constraint1][eq : constraint2 ] ) .",
    "different values for the phase can therefore result in constraints that deviate considerably . indeed , for special values of the phase the projection vanishes and the constraints disappear altogether , which are in effect @xmath70 out of phase and therefore maximize exactly when the leading terms minimize .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that they are subleading in @xmath68 implies that the constraints for those values of @xmath68 become practically meaningless . ] . in minimal cut - off models",
    "the phase of the bogoliubov parameter is actually a function of the cut - off scale @xmath3 ( [ eq : bogslowroll][eq : bogsmallcs ] ) and as a consequence for special values of @xmath3 the projected amplitudes would be significantly reduced , as can be seen in figure ( [ fig : small - cs ] ) .",
    "since the precise value of the cut - off @xmath3 is unknown , the constraints will be derived under the reasonable assumption that a typical value of @xmath3 is expected to be closer to an ( absolute value ) maximum in the projection than to the special point where the projection vanishes . to implement this",
    "we will derive the constraints based on an expression that is related to the absolute value average over a single oscillatory domain in the parameter @xmath3 .",
    ".the red upper and lower parts in the diagram correspond to the observationally excluded regions . ]",
    "let us first analyze general single field models with a small speed of sound .",
    "the minimal cut - off vacuum state proposal predicts a bogoliubov parameter with an absolute value approximately equal to @xmath96 and a phase @xmath97 . in the limit @xmath98 we derive , to leading order in @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath99 the absolute value of the bogoliubov coefficient has removed one enhancement factor , resulting in a linear @xmath68 dependence of the prefactor in front of the oscillatory @xmath100 term . as an example , the maximum contribution to the orthogonal non - gaussian template from initial state modifications has been plotted in figure [ fig : small - cs ] .",
    "as already alluded to , the oscillations in the projection factor force us to work with the average over a single oscillatory domain in order to derive a constraint on the ratio @xmath101 . simply replacing the @xmath100 with the average @xmath102 the derived bounds",
    "would only apply to about @xmath103 percent of the @xmath68 domain .",
    "if instead demanding that at least @xmath104 percent of the domain is included within the constraints , we need to replace @xmath100 with @xmath105",
    ".    the ambiguous sign due to the oscillatory behavior also prompts us to consider the bound on the ( largest ) absolute value of the non - gaussian amplitude , which for the local amplitude is @xmath106 and for the orthogonal type @xmath107 . using these largest absolute values for the local and orthogonal amplitude and insisting on a @xmath104 percent coverage , an upper bound on the parameter @xmath108 can be derived from local and orthogonal type non - gaussianities @xmath109 clearly the strongest result is obtained from the orthogonal bound , becoming stronger as @xmath43 is smaller . in fact , the speed of sound @xmath43 can not be much smaller than @xmath0 because that would produce a leading order equilateral non - gaussian result in conflict with observations . applying that minimal value of @xmath43",
    "the upper bound on @xmath108 roughly equals @xmath110 again we would like to stress that this is an _ upper _ bound .",
    "the cut - off scale should be close to the inflationary hubble scale to avoid too large an enhancement of the ( projected ) non - gaussian signal , with the exception of special higher values of @xmath3 for which the phase @xmath69 is close to an integer number times @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath112 percent of the parameter domain .",
    "this constraint is weaker than initially anticipated in @xcite , mainly because the phase in this case is a function of @xmath3 , producing oscillations in the non - gaussian signal , forcing us to introduce a factor related to the average of the absolute non - gaussian signal and the most conservative ( upper ) bound on the absolute value of the observed constraints .",
    "incorporating the , admittedly crude , _ lower _ bound on @xmath113 from analysis of the power spectrum , for a general speed of sound one arrives at @xmath114 there is a small window remaining for @xmath115 , but for small speed of sound models with @xmath116 one can conclude that minimal initial state modifications are practically ruled out , except for those special values of the phase at which the contribution to the orthogonal non - gaussian template ( nearly ) vanishes , corresponding to about @xmath112 percent of the parameter domain .    to briefly illustrate the impact of the oscillatory behavior in this analysis , consider neglecting the oscillating behavior , choosing @xmath117 for local non - gaussianities and @xmath118 for orthogonal non - gaussianities . again",
    "this would yield a strongest _ upper _ bound from the orthogonal constraints that is roughly equal to @xmath119 , which for @xmath120 can essentially be ruled out from the non - gaussian data alone and would in general be inconsistent with the power spectrum data that shows no evidence of an oscillatory effect with an amplitude that large .",
    "as already commented on , for dbi models the constraints weaken considerably , because the enhancement of the non - gaussian signal is reduced by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "this results in no enhancement at all in the projection to the local ( or orthogonal ) template , removing all dependence on the cut - off scale . as a a consequence",
    "the observational constraints do not result in ( interesting ) bounds on the cut - off scale @xmath3 , which parameterizes the initial state modification .    finally , let us briefly consider standard slow - roll inflation ( @xmath72 ) , including a dimension @xmath74 higher derivative term that , together with the initial state modification , is responsible for a large @xmath121 enhanced non - gaussian signal .",
    "inserting @xmath95 and the phase into eq .",
    "one obtains @xmath122 all enhancement in @xmath123 is lost and one is left with a maximum contribution to the local non - gaussian template that is of ( less than ) order @xmath124 , which is significantly below set constraints on local type non - gaussianities . as a consequence",
    "minimal initial state modifications in this particular canonical single field inflationary model are not constrained by the local non - gaussian projection . in order to become sensitive to the intrinsically large non - gaussian signal set by the ratio @xmath75 ,",
    "templates better adapted to the theoretical non - gaussian shape should be designed and compared to the available data .",
    "to summarize , we have applied the currently best available constraints on local , orthogonal and equilateral shape non - gaussianities to derive bounds on the cut - off scale parameterizing a ( slightly generalized ) minimal model of initial state modifications .",
    "the results strongly depend on the model of inflation under consideration .",
    "interesting bounds can be derived in the context of general , non - dbi , single field small speed of sound models of inflation . in that case , non - gaussian constraints from the orthogonal template alone lead to the following _ upper _ bound on the cut - off scale @xmath125 combined with results from the equilateral template and the power spectrum leaves only a very small window ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) , and minimal initial state modifications in general single field models with a small speed of sound can almost be ruled out . to be more precise , the above upper bound is valid for @xmath104 percent of the cut - off parameter domain , excluding small isolated regions covering in total @xmath112 percent of the parameter domain where the projection to the orthogonal template nearly vanishes as a consequence of the oscillating nature of the projection .    for dbi and a canonical single field model with a dimension @xmath74 higher derivative operator the analysis does not lead to interesting non - gaussian constraints",
    "the reason is the complete lack of sensitivity of the available templates to the large non - gaussian signal of minimal initial state modifications .",
    "consequently , more suitable templates have to be developed to efficiently probe ( minimal ) initial state modifications in these models , perhaps along the lines of @xcite .",
    "work in this direction is ongoing and we hope to report on more effective non - gausian templates and observational strategies in the near future .    an important property that we have emphasized is that ( minimal ) initial state modifications lead to a non - gaussian signal that increases as the separation between the cut - off scale and the inflationary hubble parameter increases . as a consequence",
    "non - gaussian constraints can only give rise to an upper bound on the cut - off scale parameterizing initial state modifications arising due to new physics .",
    "together with lower bounds on the cut - off scale from other considerations ( including the power spectrum data or generic effective field theory arguments ) this carries a strong potential to rule out these types of initial state modifications in the future as the non - gaussian analysis and corresponding constraints improve .    at the same time",
    "the interesting feature of an upper bound on the cut - off scale poses somewhat of a theoretical conundrum , since it is obviously in conflict with the idea of decoupling .",
    "perhaps this should be interpreted as signalling a fundamental flaw of these type of initial state modificatitions that might be responsible for inconsistencies in the perturbative expansion of the quantum field theory , conceivably ruling out these vacuum states .",
    "we hope to come back to this important issue in future work .",
    "we would like to thank pier stefano corasaniti for very beneficial and fruitful discussions .",

    "<S> in this short note we translate the best available observational bounds on the cmb bispectrum amplitudes into constraints on a specific scale - invariant new physics hypersurface ( nph ) model of vacuum state modifications , as first proposed by danielsson , in general models of single - field inflation . </S>",
    "<S> as compared to the power spectrum the bispectrum constraints are less ambiguous and provide an interesting upper bound on the cut - off scale in general models of single - field inflation with a small speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> this upper bound is incompatible with the power spectrum constraint for most of the parameter domain , leaving very little room for minimal cut - off vacuum state modifications in general single - field models with a small speed of sound . </S>"
