    "<S> a possible birefringence effect that arises in quantum gravity leads to a frequency - dependent rotation of the polarization angle of linearly polarized emission from distant sources . here </S>",

    "<S> this limit is of 3 orders better than the previous limits from observations of agns and of the crab pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> much stronger limits may be obtained by the future observation of polarization of the prompt @xmath1-rays .    </S>",

    "<S> these modifications result generically in a modification to the standard dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , introduces an energy dependent photon s velocity . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to explore this possibility and to set limit or observe it are typically based on time of flight tests of very high energy photons . in specific cases and </S>",
    "<S> in particular in loop quantum gravity , the deviations from the standard dispersion relation take a particular form in which photons with right handed and left handed polarization travel with different velocities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a frequency dependent rotation of the polarization vector of a linearly polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> observations of a linear polarization can , therefore , set limits on the magnitude of the quantum gravity birefringence parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of linear polarization in the uv / optical spectrum of distant galaxies and in the the x - ray spectrum of the crab nebula sets upper bounds on the birefringence parameter : @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much smaller limit , @xmath4 , can be obtained using the linear polarization detection in grb 021206 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the original claims of a detection of polarization of this burst @xcite have been refuted convincingly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization analysis of grb 030519b also yielded null result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible evidence for linearly polarized @xmath5rays in grb 930131 and grb 960924 @xcite was also reported . </S>",
    "<S> if correct it will provide a comparable upper limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear yet how robust are the novel methods used to estimate the polarization in these bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we explore here the implications and limits that can be set by observations of linear polarization from the optical afterglow of grb 020813 @xcite and grb 021004 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> gambini and pullin ( 1999 ) have shown that within loop quantum gravity photons with left and right circular polarizations will travel at different velocities @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denote the different polarization states and @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant . here </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the generalized form ( see also mitrofanov 2003 and the references therein ) @xmath9 , \\label{eq : mitr1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 characterizes the scale of breakdown of the standard dispersion relation in units of the planck s energy @xmath11 gev . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , one would expect @xmath12 corresponding to a typical energy scale of the planck energy or slightly higher , while a very low limit on @xmath8 would render such a modification unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> since the linear polarization is a superposition of two monochromatic waves with opposite circular polarizations , the plane of linear polarization is subject to a rotation along the photons path because of the difference between the two circular components @xcite : @xmath13dl \\over 2c } = \\eta ( { \\omega l_p \\over c})^{n+1 } { dl_{(z)}\\over l_p},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 cm is the planck s length scale and @xmath15 is the differential distance the photons has travelled ( for a flat cosmological model , i.e. , @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is the current hubble constant in units of @xmath18 .     in the redshift range @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22.,width=377,height=302 ]    the observed polarization angle at frequency @xmath23 of a photon emitted at a redshift @xmath24 with an intrinsic polarization angle </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is @xmath26 the function @xmath27 depends on the cosmology and can be expressed as @xmath28 the function @xmath29 for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 for @xmath34 , while @xmath35 for @xmath32 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the slow increase of @xmath38 for @xmath39 suggests that there is no advantage in going to very large @xmath24 values .    for @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the relevant frequencies for observing the birefringence effect are @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> so we have to probe the birefringence effect with polarimetry of the @xmath47 mev photons from a source at @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite difficult because usually at such high energy , there are not enough photons to allow a reliable polarization measurement . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there was no x@xmath2ray/@xmath5ray polarimeter planed for energy higher than @xmath49 mev @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we focus , therefore , on the case of @xmath40 .    at @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> there is no significant observable effect . on the other hand at @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> the rotation is so large that it will erase any intrinsic linear polarization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore an detection of high linear polarization at a frequency @xmath52 from a source at @xmath24 puts an upper limit on @xmath8 : @xmath53 in a limited frequency range around @xmath43 we expect to observe the birefringence effect as a frequency dependent linear polarization vector . </S>",
    "<S> such an observation could confirm the existence of a birefringence effect and the corresponding quantum gravity corrections provided that we can rule out an intrinsic origin for the rotation of the polarization vector .    </S>",
    "<S> the uv / optical spectropolarimetry of grb afterglows has been reported in several events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> good quality results were obtained on grb 020813 @xcite and grb 021004 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> to constrain @xmath8 we look for a similar frequency dependent trend in this data . </S>",
    "<S> we allow a variation in the polarization from one time to another and consider only the relative polarization angle . to do so we subtract , at each time , the average polarization angle ( which can vary intrinsically with time ) and consider only the polarization angle with respect to this average ( see fig.[fig : timeav ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter in the shift between different times provides an estimate of the error in the data . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite on october 4th 2002 and pinned down at the redshift @xmath73 by follow - up observations @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we directly take the reduced spectropolarimetry data presented in lazzati et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2003 ) using the very large telescope of the european southern observatory . as shown in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : timeav ] , we find the polarization angle of this burst is proportional to @xmath74 with a negative rather than a positive coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit indicates @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the dataset is consistent with the possibility of no shift at all ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) at the @xmath66 confidence level .     from the uv / optical polarimetry of grb 020813 and grb 021004 . </S>",
    "<S> for the joint case , @xmath76 at the @xmath70 confidence level.,width=340,height=302 ]    now we combine grb020813 and grb021004 to further investigate the possible birefringence effect that arises in quantum gravity , that is , mainly to constrain the parameter @xmath8 . to realize this , we apply the chi - square fitting to the data of both bursts and marginalize the chi - square merit function over all the possible polarization angles in order to derive the probability only for the parameter @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is to ( 1 ) calculate the probability for each given set @xmath8 and polarization angle for either burst ; ( 2 ) integrate the probabilities over polarization angle and then derive two average probabilities for each @xmath8 for either burst ; and ( 3 ) derive the joint probability for each @xmath8 for two bursts by using the formula @xmath77 $ ] , where @xmath78 means the @xmath78-th @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> this limit is about 3 orders better than the previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> for such stringent constraint on @xmath8 , the birefringence effect on our initial polarization measurement in a limited bandwidth ( @xmath81  for grb 020813 and @xmath82  for grb 021004 ) is unimportant and can be ignored .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the rotation of the polarization plane can also be induced by faraday rotation , so it is necessary to test whether the faraday rotation could affect the results discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the rotation angle induced by the faraday rotation is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the wavelength in units of meter , @xmath85 is the electron number density per @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the magnetic field strength ( gauss ) parallel the propagating direction , and @xmath88 is the distance in units of @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> typically , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 g and @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 . as can be seen , even for @xmath95 , the rotation angle at uv / optical and higher band is very small , therefore the faraday rotation is insignificant .    </S>",
    "<S> a detection of polarization of the prompt emission of grbs ( at such high frequency ) will set immediately a much stronger limit on @xmath8 @xcite . as mentioned before </S>",
    "<S> , a possible evidence for the linearly polarized @xmath5rays ( @xmath96 hundred kev ) has been reported @xcite and ruled out @xcite in grb 021206 . </S>",

    "<S> these results are consistent with each other as ( apart from the refuted claims of @xcite ) the errors are very large . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is inconclusive and additional data is needed before the corresponding strong limits on @xmath8 that have been suggested on the basis of this burst @xcite can be accepted . </S>",
    "<S> the planned x - ray/@xmath5ray polarimitors polar @xcite or xpol @xcite could resolve this issue in the future . </S>",
    "<S> even such polarimeters wo nt help with a significant limit on @xmath45 . to reach the limit @xmath97 for @xmath45 one </S>",
    "<S> needs a polarization measure of @xmath98 mev signal from a cosmological distance . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for the bursts with a hard , highly - polarized component as energetic as the one detected in grb 941017 @xcite , such a polarimetry requires a very large area ( @xmath99 ) which is beyond the goals of current design . </S>"
