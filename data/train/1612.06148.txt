    "quasars or quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) are supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with accretion disks in the center of a galaxy .",
    "they are amongst the most luminous observable objects after the epoch of recombination at @xmath7 1100 . high - redshift ( @xmath8 6.0 ) quasars are , thus , a powerful tool to probe the early universe .",

    "observed in the @xmath10 quasars discovered by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite suggest that the reionization epoch of the universe ends around @xmath10 .",
    "high - redshift quasars can be found by a red color , between two adjacent broad bands caused by the strong intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption on the blue side of the redshifted ly  @xmath4 emission ( 1216  at rest frame ) .",
    "the number of quasars we can find is limited by the survey area and depth .",
    "after decades of searching , more than 100 quasars are found between @xmath11 from various kind of surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of them are @xmath12-dropouts which are very red in @xmath13 color . to search for quasar above @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath14-dropouts are needed because the ly  @xmath4 line is redshifted to wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "several surveys covering wavelength @xmath6 1 @xmath16 m have been dedicated to search for them and only eight are found in previous work .",

    "the subaru high - z exploration of low - luminosity quasars ( shellqs ) survey also discovered one quasar / galaxy at @xmath19 @xcite however , the redshift of this qso is uncertain due to the absence of strong emission lines .    in this paper , we report a discovery of a new quasar at @xmath20 select from ps1 with a spectroscopic confirmation .",

    "thus qsos have red @xmath35 color and are very faint or undetectable in the @xmath14 and bluer bands . at first , we selected point sources as objects with a small difference between kron and psf magnitudes ( @xmath36 ) from the ps1 multiepoch stack data",
    ". further we require a very red color of @xmath37 , and signal to noise ratio ( snr ) larger than 10 in @xmath34 band .",
    "similar criteria were used by @xcite who recently reported a discovery of 3 new @xmath33 qsos from ps1 .",
    "we also require our candidates to have @xmath3824 mag in the @xmath12 and @xmath14 bands that correspond to the brightness of the sky background in ps1 .",
    "this criterion is to select candidates below detection limits of ps1 in the @xmath12 and @xmath14 bands . to exclude spurious dropouts as a result of transient or moving single - epoch objects , we require that all of our candidates are observed and detected at least on two different dates .",
    "this ensures that each of our candidates is a real object .    among the objects that satisfied the criteria above , we have put priority on those with good visibility at the time of the observation , brighter @xmath34-band magnitude , and redder @xmath35 color .",
    "the remaining candidates selected in this way are visually examined using the single epoch ps1 images .",
    "many of them are rejected by eye as they are obvious spurious , or contaminated by a nearby bright star .",
    "this eye - rejection process is not automated nor well - controlled . as a result ,",
    "our selection procedure is heterogeneous and would not be able to yield a statistically characterizable quasar sample .",
    "it is important future work to establish a more controlled process based on a newer release of the ps1 catalog .",
    "we further check our candidates with wide - field infrared survey explorer catalog ( wise,@xcite ) , but they are not detected in the allwise catalog , due to the faintness of our candidates .",
