    "naini  tal  -  cape survey is a collaborative program between india and south  africa , initiated with the main aim of searching for new northern hemisphere rapidly oscillating ap stars ( roap ) and to study them @xcite .",
    "roap stars are short period photometric variables discovered in 1978 by .",
    "the period of oscillations in these stars lie in the range of 5 - 21  minutes with typical amplitudes of few milli  magnitude .",
    "the low amplitude of oscillations and the short periods demand a very stable site and atleast one meter class telescope for the study of roap stars . for these reasons , the 104 cm sampurnanand telescope at aries , naini  tal",
    "is selected for the survey . for a summary of naini  tal  -  cape survey , and the site characteristics and facilities available at aries , naini  tal for variable star research ,",
    "readers are referred to , and .",
    "naini  tal  -  cape survey is an ongoing program . till 2004 ,",
    "we have searched for short period variability in a total of 63 stars and detected rapid oscillations in hd 12098 , @xmath0  scuti oscillation in four stars .",
    "the selection of the candidate stars for the survey is made mainly on the basis of their ap nature , strmgren colours , and temperature when ever available .",
    "on the basis of known roap stars , found that , roap stars occupy specific strmgren color space . to increase the chances of detecting new roap stars ,",
    "the candidates for the survey are selected mainly on these empirical limits on their strmgren colours .",
    "since the limits are only empirical , the selection criteria is relaxed so as to include those stars which might lie just outside these limits .",
    "in fact one of the six strmgren colors ( @xmath1 ) of hd  12098 , the first roap star discovered under the survey fall outside the corresponding limit .",
    "the ap stars which share similar properties as that of roap stars , but do not show rapid variability are called as non - oscillating ap ( noap ) stars .",
    "the noap stars hold equal importance as that of roap stars for the understanding of roap phenomenon . during naini  tal  -  cape survey",
    ", we found that three stars hd 25499 , hd 38143 and hd 38817 fall under the category of noap stars .",
    "the amplitude of variability in these three stars , if any , is less than 0.2 mmag in the frequency range of 1 - 5mhz .",
    "in addition , we observed roap variability in hd  17431 and hd  207561 on few nights , but the data at hand are not sufficient to confirm the variability in these stars .",
    "these results are discussed in the following sections .",
    "hd 12098 is the first roap star discovered in naini  tal  -  cape survey .",
    "the star is a bright ( @xmath2 ) f0 star .",
    "the strmgren color indices of the star ( @xmath3 , ) combined with the de - reddened parameters estimated using the calibrations by falls within the empirical limits suggested for roap stars except for @xmath4 .",
    "the discovery of roap oscillations in hd  12098 , thus extends the limits on @xmath4 suggested by for probable roap stars by a slight margin .    on the basis of strmgren colors ,",
    "hd  12098 was selected as a candidate for the survey and observed on the night of 1999 november 21 .",
    "the discovery light curve plotted in fig  [ hd - discovery ] clearly shows variability around 7.1  minutes .",
    "the discovery and followup observations showed that the oscillation amplitude in hd  12098 vary from night to night , indicating plausible multi - mode oscillation and/or rotational modulation . to determine the nature of oscillations , hd  12098",
    "was observed on six nights from gurushikhar observatory , mt .  abu and aries , nainital for a total of 65  hours .",
    "the analysis of individual nights data confirm the modulation in the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "the amplitude modulation in roap stars is caused mainly by two processes .",
    "first by beating of close spaced periods and second due to the rotation of the star . to identify the nature of oscillations in hd  12098 , the data obtained from mt.abu was combined on a common time scale and subjected to discrete fourier transform ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the significance level of the periods in the amplitude spectrum was determined on the basis of local noise .",
    "the running average of amplitudes of group of fifty frequencies are computed as the local noise while treating all the peaks in the data are due to noise .",
    "the significance level was set at four times the local noise level .",
    "any peak lying above this limit was treated as real . in figure  [ fig - mtabu ]",
    "this significance limit is shown in the dotted line .",
    "the oscillation around 7.1  minute ( 2.173  mhz ) well above the significance limit is clearly seen in the figure .        in figure",
    "[ fig - mtabu ] , an unresolved frequency very close to the alias peak ( marked @xmath5 ) was clearly seen . to recover this frequency and to check for any other peaks that might be buried under the main frequency at @xmath6 , a noise free sinusoid with the amplitude and frequency corresponding to @xmath6",
    "was subtracted from the time series ( prewhitening ) .",
    "the residual data was subjected to dft again .",
    "the resulting amplitude spectra is plotted in the second panel of fig.[fig - mtabu ] .",
    "the spectrum show two peaks at @xmath7  mhz with similar amplitude .",
    "the frequency difference between the two frequencies suggested one of them to be the alias of the second frequency . typically the real frequency will have a higher amplitude and the aliases will be of lower amplitude .",
    "but , for amplitudes close to the noise level , this may not be true , making it difficult to differentiate the real peak from the alias .",
    "interpreted the second frequency as the rotationally split component of the main frequency and predict a rotation period of either 1.22 or 5.5 day for hd  12098 .",
    "the ambiguity was due to the ambiguity in the identification of the second frequency .",
    "the magnetic field measurements of hd  12098 , however favour the longer rotation period .",
    "the single site observations of hd  12098 showed the second frequency as the rotationally split component of the oscillation frequency of hd  12098 .",
    "however , the second frequency suffered from 1 cycle / day alias ambiguity .    with the main aim of resolving the ambiguity in identifying the second frequency , and hence",
    ", rotation period of the star , a multi - site observation campaign on hd  12098 was organized in october / november 2002 .",
    "the campaign involved a total of eleven observatories , with ten observatories finally contributing to the data .",
    "a total of 394 hours of useful data extending over 28 nights with 45% duty cycle were obtained .    from the analysis of the multi - site data ,",
    "mainly five frequencies separated by @xmath8  mhz were obtained .",
    "the plausibility of such small difference arising due to independently excited modes was already ruled out . assuming the frequency separation to be due to rotational splitting , the equal separation of the frequencies gives a rotation period of @xmath9  days for hd  12098 , very close to the 5.5  days rotation period predicted by assuming @xmath10  mhz as the real frequency instead of @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitude modulation of oscillations of individual nights data also favours a period close to @xmath12  days .",
    "detailed observation and analysis results of the multi - site campaign will be published elsewhere .",
    "non oscillating ap stars hold equal importance in the understanding of roap phenomena .",
    "the systematic difference between the noap stars and roap stars can help us in the understanding of possible reasons for the incidence of oscillations in roap stars . during naini  tal  -  cape survey survey ,",
    "three ap stars were found to fit in to noap star category .",
    "the three noap stars hd  25499 , hd  38143 and hd  38817 are discussed briefly .",
    "hd  25499 satisfies all the six strmgren colors used for identifying probable roap stars .",
    "the star was observed on six occasions for a total of nine hours and found to show no variability at an amplitude limit of 0.2 mmag in the frequency range @xmath13  mhz .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation , if any would be below @xmath14  mmag at @xmath15 confidence level .",
    "the lightcurve and the amplitude spectrum of hd  25499 observed on 10 nov 2003 is plotted in figure  [ fig-25499lc ] and figure  [ fig-25499 ft ] respectively .",
    "though , there seems to be a peak above the significance level around 0.6  mhz corresponding to 28  minutes , it is not considered real due to the absence of similar period in the other observations .",
    "hd  38143 is an a2 star whose strmgren color indices lie well within the empirical limits suggested by .",
    "the star was first observed on 23 january 2000 , on three nights in 2002 and two nights in 2003 for a total of 22 hours .",
    "no variability was seen in all the runs at an amplitude limit of @xmath16  mmag .",
    "the lightcurve of hd  38143 observed on 2003 november 19 is plotted in figure  [ fig-38143lc ] with the corresponding amplitude spectrum in figure  [ fig-38143 ft ] .",
    "the available observations on hd  38143 suggest that the star is a noap star , unless , hd  38143 has a very long rotation period or the oscillations if any have amplitudes below our detection limit ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "hd  38817 is classified as an a2 star .",
    "only three of the six strmgren colors ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) satisfy the limits suggested for a probable roap star , while @xmath21 lies with in 10% of the corresponding limits .",
    "the star was selected as a candidate star for naini  tal  -  cape survey to check the possible extension of these limits , but turned out to be a non - variable at a limiting amplitude of 0.2 mmag .",
    "the star was observed for a total of 14 hours over four nights with the last three nights observations extending for more than three hours each .",
    "the lightcurve and the corresponding amplitude spectrum of hd  38817 observed on 2003 november 09 are plotted in figure  [ fig-38817lc ] & [ fig-38817 ft ] respectively . from the analysis of the data",
    "we conclude that hd  38817 is a noap star at a limiting amplitude of 0.4  mmag at @xmath15 confidence level .",
    "in the course of our survey , we observed variability in the frequency range of 1 - 5 mhz in two stars hd  207561 and hd  17431 .",
    "but , the data on hand are not sufficient to confirm variability in these stars .",
    "hd  207561 is classified as an am star @xcite and the confirmation of rapid variability will make it the first am star showing roap type variability . for the benefit of the others who may be interested in these stars ,",
    "we briefly describe them .",
    "hd  207561 is an f0  iii star whose strmgren colours fall well within the empirical limits for probable roap stars .",
    "the star was observed on 2000 december 16 for the first time .",
    "the lightcurve and the corresponding fourier spectrum of hd  207561 obtained on two consecutive nights 2002 december 6 & 7 are plotted in figure  [ fig-207561 ] clearly show regular variations .",
    "similar variations were absent in the comparison star data observed simultaneously with the second channel .",
    "both the lightcurve and the amplitude spectrum of hd  207561 plotted in fig.[fig-207561 ] clearly show regular variability around six minutes on two different nights .",
    "the absence of similar variation in the comparison star rules out the possibility of local effects . but",
    "the absence of six minute period in the followup observations do not allow us to confirm rapid oscillations in the star .",
    "also the period is very close to six minutes .",
    "when ever periodicity of integral multiple of a minute is detected , care should be taken to rule out the plausibility of drive error or other instrumental effects mimicking regular variability .",
    "another likely reason for the non - detection of oscillations in the follow up nights might be due to mis - identification of the star . however , the confirmation of the presence or absence of oscillations in hd  207561 will be important as it will make hd  207561 the first am star with roap type variability .",
    "hd  17431 is classified as an a3 star .",
    "the strmgren color indices of the star satisfy all the six strmgren parameters suggested for a probable roap star .",
    "the star was first observed on the night of 2000 october 2000 09 .",
    "the fourier transform of the data showed a peak around 8.8 minutes .",
    "similar periods were observed in the follow up observations though not with very good signal except , on 2000 october 10 . in figure",
    "[ fig-17431 ] , the amplitude spectrum of the data obtained on 2000 october 10 and 2001 december 6 are plotted , which indicate the presence of a period around 8.8 minutes . though , similar variability near this period was seen on other nights , the nights were not photometric and hence , prevents from confirming variability in hd  17431 .",
    "we present a brief summary of the main results of naini  tal  -  cape survey conducted from late 1999 to early 2004 . during this period one roap star hd  12098 a mono",
    "periodic oscillator was discovered .",
    "the amplitude modulation of the pulsation frequency and frequency splitting observed in hd  12098 suggest a rotation period of @xmath22  days for the star .",
    "the survey also resulted in the classification of three stars hd  25499 , hd  38143 and hd  38817 as non oscillating ap stars , useful in the understanding of the differences between roap and ap stars sharing similar properties of roap stars but no oscillations .",
    "also presented were two promising roap candidates hd  17431 and hd  207561 which showed variability in few observations .",
    "further observations on the two are needed to confirm variability in these stars .",
    "the confirmation of oscillations in hd  207561 will be an exciting result as it will make hd  207561 the first am star to show rapid variability .",
    "the author would like to thank dr .",
    "s. seetha for introducing the exciting field of roap stars .",
    "she is also instrumental in organizing the multi - site campaign on hd  12098 .",
