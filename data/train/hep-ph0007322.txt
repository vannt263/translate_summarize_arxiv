    "the factorization calculation@xcite has successfully reproduced the decay rate for many two - body channels of @xmath0 decay .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the factorization should become exact in the large @xmath7-quark mass limit and that the only deviation from the factorization is short - distance corrections of @xmath8 . for some channels of @xmath0 decay",
    ", however , the factorization calculation appears to be in clear disagreement with current measurement@xcite .",
    "theoretically the factorization and the final - state interaction ( fsi ) are closely tied together@xcite .",
    "if the factorization is a good approximation , the fsi phase should be small in general . if the fsi phase turns out to be large in experiment , it is a warning sign against the factorization .",
    "some _ initial state _ interaction can also affect the factorization@xcite .",
    "the observed smallness of the upper bounds on the fsi phases of the two - body @xmath9 processes such as @xmath10 is consistent with absence of long - distance fsi@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "purely phenomenological suggestions were recently made about possibility of large fsi phases in @xmath11 , @xmath12@xcite . at present ,",
    "little is known in experiment about fsi phases of decays other than the charm producing channels .",
    "the factorization clearly fails in the @xmath13 decay in spite of the relatively small value of @xmath14 .",
    "the observed relative fsi phase in @xmath15 is close to @xmath16@xcite though one would naively expect the factorization to work reasonably well if @xmath17 is really the controlling parameter of its corrections . in most of the two - body decay channels of @xmath18",
    "so far analyzed@xcite . ] in two - body @xmath0 decays the _ c.m .",
    "_ energy between a fast quark and a spectator grows only like @xmath19 with @xmath20 , not linearly in @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 must be large in order for perturbative qcd to be applicable . even if one accepts the asymptotic validity of the factorization in theory@xcite , one should test in experiment whether or not the @xmath0 mass of 5.3 mev is high enough to be in the asymptopia of its final states .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend the basic premise of the factorization and explore its consequences in three - meson decay channels of @xmath0 decay in which one of mesons is soft .",
    "we propose simple selection rules which will provide a further test of the fractorization at the @xmath0 mass scale .",
    "our approach is purely phenomenological and we do not attempt here a rigorous justification of the selection rules by perturbative qcd .",
    "when we compare the selection rules with the soft - pion theorem of chiral symmetry , it appears as if they were incompatible .",
    "the origin of this superficial incompatibility is traced to difference in kinematics : the selection rules hold when the _ c.m . _",
    "energy @xmath19 between a fast quark and a soft quark is sufficiently large , while the soft - pion theorem holds when the same _ c.m .",
    "_ energy is equal to a light quark mass , _",
    "i.e. , _ negligibly small .",
    "the purpose of our selection rules is to probe if @xmath19 in @xmath0 decay is in the qcd asymptopia or not .",
    "we state the factorization of two - body decays as follows : when a @xmath0 meson decays with a current - current interaction through the quark decay process , @xmath21 either @xmath22 or @xmath23 forms one meson and the remaining @xmath24 or @xmath25 forms the other meson with a soft quark @xmath26 from the light spectator cloud around @xmath27 .",
    "( see fig.1a . )",
    "the formation of a meson by two hard quarks through a color - singlet current is given by a decay constant while the formation of the other meson is described by a transition form factor of the other current .",
    "it is important that once combinations of @xmath28 have been chosen for meson formation , no flavor exchange occurs thereafter , not even a charge exchange .",
    "any flavor - changing process is supposedly a higher order process of perturbative qcd .",
    "therefore the final mesons retain their flavor contents , including charges , determined by the short - distance quark decay process .",
    "this leads us to various constraints of the factorization which relate different isospin amplitudes of two - body decays for a given decay operator .    what happens if three mesons are produced ?",
    "in the case that all final mesons are energetic , each meson should contain one of the three final quarks of eq.([qqq ] ) picking up one soft quark from the spectator cloud .",
    "( see fig.1b . ) in the case that two of the mesons are energetic and one is very soft , the energetic mesons are formed just as in the two - body decay and the third one emerges from the spectator cloud with energy no larger than @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the energetic mesons retain the history of the weak interaction while the soft meson is made of whatever left in the spectator cloud .",
    "this is the natural extension of the factorization from two - body decays to three - body decays .",
    "we call this picture as the factorization for three - body decays and explore its consequences here",
    ". the _ c.m .",
    "_ energy of the fsi between an energetic meson and the soft cloud is @xmath30 , which is the same as the _ c.m . _",
    "energy of @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the two - body decay in fig.1a . , but our selection rules do not depend on a soft interaction between them . ]",
    "if @xmath19 is large and short - distance qcd dominates in fsi , flavor exchange between any pair of final mesons would be a higher order correction . in this case , the three quarks produced by the @xmath27-quark can be tracked down into the flavor contents of the final mesons .",
    "we illustrate derivation of our selection rule in the decay , @xmath32 which proceeds through the tree - operator @xmath33 and its gluon corrections . the boldface letter @xmath34 in eq.([dpipi ] ) represents a cloud of light quark - antiquarks and gluons around @xmath27 which carries the net flavor of the @xmath35-quark ; @xmath36 we refer to @xmath34 as the spectator @xmath35-quark cloud .",
    "when the decay products @xmath37 of @xmath27 enter three mesons one each , all mesons are energetic . in this case",
    "we can not find a simple flavor selection rule of the factorization .",
    "the reason is as follows : even if no flavor exchange occurs between final mesons , the process @xmath38 occurs perpetually inside the cloud prior to meson formation .",
    "this annihilation process has the same effect as a flavor exchange between final mesons since each meson picks up one soft quark from the cloud .",
    "therefore , no simple testable selection rule results in this case .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one of the pions is soft , it must be generated by the spectator cloud without involving a hard quark .",
    "the three quarks from @xmath39 must go into @xmath40 and the energetic @xmath41 . and @xmath42 are negligible . ]",
    "the hard @xmath43 can form either @xmath6 , @xmath44 , or @xmath40 while the hard @xmath42 can form either @xmath6 or @xmath44 . even though @xmath42 or @xmath45 picks one soft quark from the cloud",
    ", the resulting meson is energetic .",
    "after one quark ( @xmath43 or @xmath35 ) is removed from the spectator cloud * d * of total charge @xmath46 , the remainder of the cloud is either negatively charged or neutral .",
    "that is , the soft pion can be either @xmath5 or @xmath44 , but not @xmath6 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath6 can not be soft in @xmath47 .",
    "this selection rule is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "in fact , the selection rule holds irrespective of the decay interaction .",
    "it depends only on the flavor content of the spectator * d * : _ when one quark is taken away from a cloud of charge @xmath46 , the remainder can not be positively charged . _",
    "the key is that mesons carry quantum numbers of quark - antiquark no matter what their fock - space compositions are .",
    "the only assumption we have made here is that the energetic mesons do not exchange a flavor with the soft meson by short - distance qcd dominance in fsi",
    ".    our prediction should be tested in the form , @xmath48 where @xmath49 for the soft pion .",
    "the bands of the @xmath12 and @xmath50 resonances should be excluded in testing eq.([sel ] ) . if , contrary to the factorization , elastic or inelastic rescattering is important at @xmath51 ( @xmath52 gev ) , @xmath53 can be fed through the unsuppressed decay modes , for instance , through @xmath54 followed by the forward charge exchange rescattering @xmath55 or through @xmath56 followed by the backward elastic rescattering @xmath57 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the forward rescattering of two units of charge exchange .",
    "thus the selection rule is sensitive to fsi .",
    "the fsi of our concern is the soft - hard process at _ c.m .",
    "_ energy of @xmath30 that involves a hard quark , since the soft - soft fsi is no more than a different pick of soft quarks from the cloud .",
    "selection rules similar to eq.([sel ] ) can be derived for many other three - body decay modes .",
    "considering their relative simplicity , it is worthwhile exploring such selection rules for better understanding of strong interaction dynamics in @xmath0 decay .",
    "the @xmath40 meson can be replaced by any meson or meson resonance in eq.([dpipi ] ) ; @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes a neutral meson or meson resonance such as @xmath60 , @xmath44 , or @xmath61 .",
    "the selection rule reads : @xmath62 we can apply the same reasoning to @xmath63 by replacing the spectator @xmath34 by @xmath64 ; @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a positively charged meson or meson resonance such as @xmath67 , @xmath6 , and @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , we can write the selection rule @xmath70    if we include @xmath71 in the spectator cloud , we obtain corresponding selection rules , @xmath72 furthermore , @xmath73 since the rest energy of a kaon exceeds @xmath74 , formation of any kaon from the spectator cloud is kinematically suppressed .",
    "eqs.(8 ) to ( [ kaon4 ] ) mean that the factorization - forbidden modes are even further suppressed than the modes in the denominators .",
    "the lightest meson resonance that the spectator cloud can produce is the @xmath75-meson .",
    "since its rest mass far exceeds @xmath74 , @xmath76 is suppressed no matter what charge state the @xmath75-meson is in .",
    "the cloud simply does not have enough energy to produce @xmath75 even at rest .    to be concrete ,",
    "consider @xmath77 .",
    "then the lack of energy in producing a resonance from the cloud leads us to @xmath78 where @xmath75 can be in any charge state . in eq.([selrho ] ) @xmath75 may be replaced by @xmath79 or some other resonance .",
    "similarly , @xmath80    though we have listed only the selection rules that are relatively simple and clean , one can write down many more selection rules by the same reasoning .    since meson or meson resonance production of energy higher than @xmath29 from the cloud",
    "is highly suppressed kinematically , we may raise the softness limit considerably from @xmath81 to , for instance , @xmath82 in actual testing of the selection rules , provided that one can avoid resonance bands of quasi - two - body decays .",
    "if we raise it too high , however , the tail of the energy spectrum of a decay product quark enters the `` soft meson '' . to find a compromise , we need some numerical study .",
    "our selection rules are based on the postulate that a soft meson must be produced entirely from the spectator cloud .",
    "therefore , they would fail if a soft meson contains a significant contribution from the low - energy tail of a decay product of @xmath83 . for this reason we would like to know how much the low - energy tail contributes when we define the soft meson by @xmath84 .",
    "if the tail is indeed negligible , then we should ask how much we can raise the upper limit of softness in actual test without violating the selection rules substantially .    to be concrete , consider @xmath85 again .",
    "suppose that we define the soft pion by its momentum @xmath86 .",
    "estimate of the matrix element involves uncertainties in soft meson formation .",
    "if we use the quark - hadron duality for the low - energy tail region and replace the meson wavefunctions by their average values , we can obtain a crude estimate of the decay rate ratio as @xmath87 where @xmath88 . the factor @xmath89 , which arises from difference in meson formation probability , is given by the ratio of the pion wavefunction @xmath90 on the light - cone as @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath89 is sensitive to @xmath93 near the end point .",
    "let us extrapolate @xmath94 smoothly to @xmath95 .",
    "then for @xmath96 @xmath97 the right - hand side is a fraction of 1% for @xmath98 mev .",
    "it is indeed small due to the phase space suppression of the soft @xmath43-quark and a smaller meson formation probability for a quark pair of highly uneven energies . from this estimate",
    "we expect that accuracy of our selection rules should be very high .",
    "when @xmath99 is raised to @xmath100 , the ratio in eq.([q1 ] ) goes up to 8% . in carrying out experimental test , therefore , we may be able to raise the softness upper limit from @xmath74 to @xmath100 .",
    "the main background in testing our this selection rule will be a spillover from the resonance bands of @xmath61 and @xmath101 due to errors in pion measurement .",
    "in the zero four - momentum limit of the soft pion , we can relate three - body decay matrix elements to two - body decay matrix elements by the soft - pion theorem of chiral symmetry .",
    "it can be expressed with @xmath102 mev as @xmath103|b\\rangle + k_{\\mu}m^{\\mu},\\ ] ] where the @xmath104 term gives the correction to the soft - pion limit@xcite . for soft @xmath6 emission ,",
    "@xmath105 should be replaced by @xmath106 . upon extrapolation to the physical pion at rest @xmath107 ,",
    "the correction term @xmath104 is of @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a typical excitation energy of the @xmath0 system . according to the traditional wisdom ,",
    "the born diagram of @xmath110 is likely the most important correction ( see fig.3a ) since it is nearly degenerate with @xmath0 ( @xmath111 mev ) .",
    "this correction can be of @xmath112 or even dominate over the zero - four - momentum limit for a physical soft pion .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath113 contribution to @xmath104 satisfies the selection rule eq.([sel ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is the case for the contributions from all born diagrams .",
    "the reason is that the quark diagrams for the born diagrams of fig.3a are topologically equivalent to those of the three - body factorization process .",
    "the only difference between them is whether a soft pion is emitted from the cloud before or after weak interaction takes place .",
    "if we keep only the soft - pion limit , we obtain @xmath114 eq.([s2 ] ) results from the vanishing commutator , @xmath115=0 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , the zero four - momentum limit of the factorization - forbidden decay @xmath116 is related to @xmath117 . while @xmath118 is @xmath119 for @xmath120 , it is the leading term for @xmath121 .",
    "eqs.([s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) look puzzling at the first sight .",
    "if we work out the soft - pion limit for @xmath122 , our three - body factorization predicts @xmath123 while the soft - pion theorem gives for the tree - operator @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xmath126 the situation looks equally bizzare in @xmath127 through the penguin operators . since the penguin operators of @xmath128 are all singlets of chiral su(2)@xmath129su(2 ) , their commutators with the axial isospin charges are zero .",
    "that is , the soft - pion limit should disappear for all matrix elements of @xmath130 as @xmath131 for the penguin operators .",
    "it appears as if the selection rules contradicted the soft - pion theorem of chiral symmetry .",
    "we can trace the origin of this apparent discrepancy to the _ c.m . _",
    "energy between a fast quark ( @xmath132 ) from @xmath27-decay and a soft quark ( @xmath133 ) in the cloud . in the _ physical _ soft pion limit where our selection rules should hold ,",
    "@xmath134 while in the zero four - momentum limit @xmath135 in order for the factorization to work , the right - hand side of eq.([cm1 ] ) must be large enough to be in the asymptopia of qcd .",
    "the same variable is equal to the light quark mass in the soft - pion theorem .",
    "their predictions apply to different kinematical regions .",
    "the chiral lagrangian has been successful for which the soft - pion theorem gives the leading terms .",
    "however , extrapolation to the physical region of @xmath0-decays is a long way because of large @xmath0 mass ( cf eqs.([cm1 ] ) and ( [ cm2 ] ) ) and involves large incalculable corrections .",
    "we can understand what physical process the soft - pion theorem represents@xcite .",
    "the commutator of the axial charge @xmath136 with weak decay operator @xmath137 arises from its commutator with the currents in @xmath137 . in the case of @xmath138 at @xmath139 with @xmath140 , for instance ,",
    "the commutator with @xmath141 survives to give @xmath142 =    ( \\overline{b}_{l\\alpha}\\gamma_{\\mu}c_{l\\beta } ) (     \\overline{u}_{l\\beta}\\gamma^{\\mu}u_{l\\alpha }    -\\overline{d}_{l\\beta}\\gamma^{\\mu}d_{l\\alpha}),\\ ] ] where the right - hand side is the @xmath143 partner of @xmath121 .",
    "this commutator describes production of states of charge @xmath144 through @xmath141 of @xmath121 and subsequent fragmentation of the soft @xmath6 from them .",
    "emission of a zero - four - momentum pion from the energetic quark pair @xmath141 is not suppressed by asymptotic freedom since no large momentum transfer occurs .",
    "after the @xmath6 emission , these states ( @xmath145 ) and the operator @xmath146 together produce the final state @xmath147 .",
    "( see fig.3b . ) for soft @xmath5 emission , the commutator vanishes so that there is no diagram corresponding to fig.3b .",
    "thus physics in the zero - four - momentum limit is quite different from what we have introduced as an extension of the factorization in this paper .",
    "an important question is which picture gives a better description of the three - body @xmath0 decay in which one pion is soft .",
    "is the approximation of @xmath148 better than the zero four - momentum approximation ?",
    "the issue should be settled by experimental test of the selection rules proposed here .",
    "the dynamics underlying the factorization can be tested with the selection rules in three - body decays in which one of mesons is soft . the selection rules test whether the soft - hard fsi at _ c.m .",
    "_ energy of @xmath30 is in the qcd asymptopia or not .",
    "the rules are intuitive and do not depend on decay operators nor on form factors .",
    "if the selection rules are verified in experiment , we would obtain better understanding of physics underlying the factorization and strong interactions in @xmath0 decay in general .",
