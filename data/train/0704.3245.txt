    "pulsars are believed to be the remnants of supernova explosions .",
    "they have masses 1@xmath0 , radii @xmath1 , and a temperature of the order of @xmath2 at birth , cooling within a few days to about @xmath3 by emitting neutrinos .",
    "pulsars are normally known as neutron stars .",
    "qualitatively , a neutron star is analogous to a white dwarf star , with the pressure due to degenerate neutrons rather than degenerate electrons .",
    "the assumption that the neutrons in a neutron star can be treated as an ideal gas is not well justified : the effect of the strong force needs to be taken into account by replacing the equation of state ( eos ) for an ideal gas by a more realistic eos .",
    "the composition of pulsars remains a source of speculation , with some of the possibilities being the presence of hyperons @xcite , a mixed phase of hyperons and quarks @xcite , a phase of deconfined quarks or pion and kaon condensates @xcite .",
    "another possibility would be that pulsars are , in fact , quark stars @xcite . in conventional models ,",
    "hadrons are assumed to be the true ground state of the strong interaction .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that _ strange matter _ composed of deconfined @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks is the true ground state of all matter . in the stellar modeling ,",
    "the structure of the star depends on the assumed eos , which is different in each of the above mentioned cases .",
    "an important distinction between quark stars and conventional neutron stars is that the quark stars are self - bound by the strong interaction , whereas neutron stars are bound by gravity .",
    "once an adequate eos is chosen , it is used as input to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite , which are derived from einstein s equations in the schwarzschild metric for a static , spherical star .",
    "some of the stellar properties , as the radius , gravitational and baryonic masses , central energy densities , etc are obtained .",
    "these results are then tested against some of the constraints provided by astronomers and astrophysicists @xcite and some of the eos are shown to be inappropriate for describing pulsars @xcite .",
    "notice also that the temperature in the interior of the star is not constant @xcite , but the entropy per baryon is .",
    "this is the reason for choosing fixed entropies to take the temperature effects into account .",
    "the maximum entropy per baryon ( @xmath6 ) reached in the core of a new born star is about 2 ( in units of boltzmann s constant ) @xcite .",
    "we then use eos obtained with @xmath7 ) , 1 and 2 .",
    "we study the effects of the electric charge in compact stars .",
    "this study was first performed in stars composed of hot ionized gas @xcite and then reconsidered for a cold star ( @xmath8 ) described by a polytropic eos @xcite .",
    "the electric charge distribution is assumed to be proportional to the mass density .",
    "the tov equations again have to be modified to take the electric field into account . in the present work",
    "once more all possible classes of pulsars are examined in the presence of the electric field for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the formalisms of the electrically charged stars are revisited and the results are presented . in sec .",
    "iii the results are discussed and the main conclusions are drawn .",
    "as the first step we need to know the eos of the system , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 is the energy density , and @xmath14 is the number density of baryons . once an adequate eos is obtained , it can be used to provide the stellar properties .      in this section",
    "we include modifications in the tov equations to describe electrically charged pulsars with null angular velocity .",
    "the geometry that describes a static spherical star is given by equation ( 1 ) . in order that the maxwell equations are incorporated into the stress tensor @xmath15 ,",
    "it becomes : @xmath16 where again @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 is the energy density , and @xmath17 is the 4-velocity vector .",
    "the electromagnetic field obeys the relation @xmath18_{,\\nu}=4\\pi j^{\\mu}\\sqrt{-g},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the four current density .",
    "next we consider static stars only .",
    "hence the electromagnetic field is only due to the electric charge , which means that @xmath20 , and the other terms are absent . from the four - potential @xmath21",
    "the surviving potential is @xmath22 .",
    "thus the electric field is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge density .",
    "the electric field can be written as @xmath25 and total charge of the system as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radius of the star .    in the star frame",
    "the mass is @xmath28    to an observer at infinity , the mass is @xmath29    by using the conservation law of the stress tensor @xmath30 we obtain the hydrostatic equation @xmath31(\\epsilon+p)}{r^2\\left(1-\\frac{2m_{tot}}{r}\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\rho_{ch}e(r)e^{\\lambda/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side comes from the gravitational force and the second term comes from the coulomb force . by using the metric and the relation @xmath32 we obtain the following differential equation @xmath33,\\ ] ] which is used to determine the metric @xmath34 .",
    "so , we have a set of differential equations to be solved formed by equations(19 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 23 ) and ( 25 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath35 are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and at @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the charge goes with the energy density @xmath13 as prescribed in @xcite :    @xmath41    this choice of charge distribution is a reasonable assumption in the sense that a large mass can hold a large amount of charge . in table",
    "[ tab : tab2 ] results for electrically charged neutron stars are presented .",
    "we have calculated the results for 48 different configuration models of compact stars .",
    "once again the eos for hadronic and hybrid stars were taken from @xcite , the eos for quarkionic stars were taken from @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : tab2 ] the electric charge @xmath42 is given in coulomb and @xmath43 varies from zero ( no charge ) to a small value ( 0.0006 ) .",
    "the related mass - radius plots for hadronic , hybrid and quarkionic stars are given respectively in figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] and [ fig3]-[fig4 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "let s now go back to our results in order to compare them with what is found in the literature and draw the conclusions .    in @xcite the models named o , p , q and r given in table [ tab : tab2 ] can again be compared with our result for the hadronic star at @xmath8 and they are indeed very similar .",
    "we next look at the results displayed in table [ tab : tab2 ] and corresponding figures .",
    "the general trend is the same observed in a simple polytropic eos for @xmath8 @xcite , i.e. , the electric charge , the maximum mass and the mass observed at infinity increase with @xmath43 , as it should be .",
    "although the eos used in the present work are very different from the one used in @xcite the values of the radii obtained and the electric charge for a fixed @xmath43 value are compatible . figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2],[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] also show the same behavior as fig . 2 of @xcite , i.e. , as @xmath43 increases , the maximum mass and radius of a family of stars increase .",
    "the eos used in the present work are for bare pulsars , i.e. the outmost layer is not included . from table [ tab : tab2 ] one can see that the effect of entropy on a charged star remains the same as in a neutral star : the maximum masses and the radii decrease with the increase of the entropy for hadronic and quarkionic stars within the njl model . for hybrid and mit stars",
    "the behavior is not so well defined .    in the present work we have investigated one possible variation on the usual electrically neutral pulsars : the inclusion of electric charge .",
    "we have observed that the behaviors shown in previous works with much simpler eos were also observed here .",
    "the influence of the temperature was also investigated .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the energy released from the conversion of a metastable star ( hadronic or hybrid ) to a stable star ( hybrid or quarkionic ) under the influence of the electric charge .",
    "a more detailed and complete investigation , with a smaller bag parameter in the mit bag model is under way .",
    "this work was partially supported by cnpq ( brazil ) . m.d.a . would like to thank cnpq for a master s degree scholarship ."
