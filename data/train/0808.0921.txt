    "hydrodynamic simulations tell us that dark matter near the epoch of galaxy formation collapses into an ordered filamentary pattern , the so - called  cosmic web . \" in turn , this cosmic web is thought to cradle high - redshift galaxies in dense nodes that are opaque to the extragalactic ultraviolet background radiation .",
    "observations of h  i surrounding these high - redshift objects provide information on the likely reservoirs from which galaxies assemble their gas .",
    "hitherto , it has only been possible to measure h  i opacities towards bright quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) ; unfortunately , the high ultraviolet flux from the qsos ionizes the hydrogen clouds in their vicinity , thereby making the determination of h  i cloud physical conditions unreliable close to the qso .",
    "new techniques and facilities in the past decade have enabled detailed observational studies of the igm in the early universe ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "for example , the spectra of high - redshift qsos show a plethora of h  i ly@xmath3 absorption lines , the  ly@xmath3 forest \" , as well as lines from a wide variety of heavier elements , all of which provide detailed information about the high - redshift igm along the line - of - sight towards the qso . around the qsos themselves , however , the ultraviolet flux is so high that it typically ionizes the surrounding gas .",
    "thus qsos are not ideal for studying the pervasive igm close to the qso .",
    "instead , we suggest that bright galaxies may provide better probes for the study of igm conditions in the proximity of high - redshift objects , as these objects emit fewer ultraviolet photons than qsos do .    the subject of this paper is the ly@xmath3 forest in the spectrum of an unusually bright high - redshift galaxy at @xmath7 ( frye et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ) .",
    "the galaxy is situated behind the massive galaxy cluster abell 1689 ( @xmath8 ) , which magnifies the starlight of this background object by a factor of 10.3 by the effect of gravitational lensing ( broadhurst et al .",
    "multicolor hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging of one of the faint lensed images , hereafter designated @xmath9 , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we assume a cosmology for this paper of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "our spectrum of @xmath9 is made possible with present telescopes only by the combination of strong lensing _ and _ unusually - long observations .",
    "we obtained the spectrum for @xmath9 in 14 hours at the very large telescope ( vlt ) with the focal reducer and low - dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 ) in 2001 june and july and report a spectral resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "we fluxed the data with the standard star ltt9239 , and performed the reductions with a code written by the first author in idl designed to maximize the signal to noise of background - limited objects .",
    "see @xcite for more details on this purpose - built spectroscopic reduction package .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath9 ( figure  2 ) shows an h  i ly@xmath3 emission line and several strong low- and high - ionization metal absorption lines detected against the stellar continuum . on the basis of a mean velocity difference of @xmath15 = 470 km s@xmath11 between the positional centroids of the metal absorption features and the ly@xmath3 emission line",
    ", we apply an offset correction @xcite and measure a systemic redshift of @xmath16 for the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , ly@xmath3 absorption immediately shortward of the emission line is not obviously damped at our spectral resolution , with a column density of log [ @xmath17 ( @xmath18 < 20.0 \\pm 0.3 $ ] dex ( see figure 2 inset ) . at our spectral resolution , the detected absorption lines are strongly - saturated and thus are not suitable for deriving metallicities .",
    "the most unusual feature of the spectrum is the broad absorption trough in the ly@xmath3 forest first appearing at the ly@xmath3 emission feature and extending towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "although two transmission spikes are visible at @xmath56800   and @xmath57040  , nearly 100 % of the continuum is absorbed between wavelengths of 6850 - 7100  .    what might this absorption represent ?",
    "it is likely that we are detecting the presence of many more overlapping ly@xmath3 forest clouds closer to the galaxy than can survive the uv radiation field of qsos at comparable distances . at the resolution of our data , individual ly@xmath3 forest lines",
    "can not be resolved , and we would see only the effects of a large number of blended lines .",
    "it is also possible that the enhanced absorption could be from only a few overlapping , but very high-@xmath17 clouds , but we might then expect to see more metal absorption lines from these clouds redward of the lya emission line , which are absent in our data .",
    "even less likely is that this h  i overdensity signals the late completion of cosmic reionization , as recent observational studies have set convincing constraints for this epoch at @xmath19 6.3 ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ; songaila 2004 ) .",
    "we explore the nature of this remarkably large absorption trough with a comparison to the ly@xmath3 absorption seen towards their brighter counterpart objects , the qsos .",
    "qsos produce radiation fields that ionize hydrogen over large , @xmath516 physical mpc regions at @xmath20 ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) ( red solid line in figure  2 inset ) .",
    "although evidence has emerged of a softening of this proximity effect in the transverse direction on small scales of @xmath21 mpc from studies of qso pairs ( bowen et al .",
    "20006 ; tytler et al .",
    "detailed studies of the lyman - series forest are made routinely only outside the ionizing influence of the qsos .",
    "in contrast , ordinary star forming galaxies have modest proximity zones of size @xmath22 physical mpc @xcite , thereby enabling the study of h i and its structure in the vicinity of deep potential wells where the gas is not ionized . despite the advantage of a small proximity zone ,",
    "galaxies suffer from being much fainter in the ultraviolet .",
    "unlike the vast majority of star - forming galaxies , our target is bright because it is strongly - lensed , thereby yielding a spectrum suitable for measuring the transmitted flux @xmath23 in the ly@xmath3 forest in the proximity of a _ galaxy_.",
    "we calculate the gunn - peterson ( gp ) optical depth @xcite , @xmath24 , where @xmath23 is the ratio of the average observed flux to the average unabsorbed continuum flux , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is determined by stellar synthesis models fit to the photometric data . we compute @xmath27 in several redshift bins extending from a wavelength clear of the red wing of ly@xmath28 up to the blue edge of our model fit to the h  i in the source ( blue dashed line in figure  2 inset delimits the extent of the highest redshift bin ) . uncertainties in @xmath27",
    "are dominated by the intrinsic scatter of the continuum flux levels due to the stochastic nature of the absorption in the igm , or sample variance @xcite , but also include continuum placement errors and shot noise .",
    "figure  3 shows the results measured from the @xmath9 spectrum and compares our values for @xmath27 to those observed toward a large sample of qsos ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ; songaila 2004 ) .    , is measured in the ly@xmath3 forest of the spectrum for @xmath9 .",
    "the values for @xmath27 in five redshift bins of @xmath29 each in the rest frame of the source ( red points ) , are compared to measurements towards qsos [ square - shaped points @xcite and diamond - shaped points ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) ] . while @xmath27 is expected to lie close to the bulk of the qso points and model predictions [ dashed curve ( fan et al . 2006 ) and solid curve @xcite ] , surprisingly , there is an excess in @xmath27 along the line of sight to @xmath9 at @xmath30 .",
    "the highest redshift point is the most deviant ; it corresponds to a physical region of size 14 ( physical ) mpc and this suggests that there is more h  i gas close to the galaxy compared to the standard igm .",
    "the error bars in the data are dominated by the intrinsic scatter of the continuum flux levels due to the stochastic nature of the absorption in the igm , or sample variance , and also include continuum - placement uncertainties and shot noise . [ fig_tau ] ]    we emphasize that the values for @xmath31 are measured in the same way towards both the qsos and the galaxy , and after first excluding the proximity zone , thereby yielding information only on the pervasive igm ; that is the igm immediately _ outside _ the photoionizing influence of the source .",
    "assuming @xmath31 to be the same in the standard igm towards _ any _ background object , we would expect @xmath31 to rise steadily towards @xmath9 with absorption redshift following the bulk of the qso points .",
    "compared to the predictions of a power - law model based on the density distribution ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) and a lognormal optical depth distribution ( becker et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath27 measurements toward @xmath9 are in good agreement at @xmath32 ; at @xmath30 , however , we see a significant excess in @xmath27 . if the underlying mass distribution were unaltered by the presence of the galaxy , then this highest - redshift point , the one in closest physical proximity of the galaxy , should have also followed the behavior of the other points .",
    "the highest redshift point is the most deviant ; it corresponds to a physical radius @xmath33 ( physical ) mpc , and this result suggests that there is more h  i gas close to the galaxy compared to the standard igm .",
    "@xmath9 is imaged in several bands , as follows : @xmath34 ( hst acs ) , @xmath35 ( hst nicmos ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( son of isaac instrument on eso new technology telescope ) , and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ( irac on spitzer space telecope ) . the observing details for these data are discussed elsewhere ( frye et al .",
    "2007 ) . from these data we set initial constraints on the galaxy age and dust extinction .",
    "our high quality @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 points indicate only a modest h  i balmer series continuum break at rest - frame @xmath54000  and thus a young underlying stellar population dominated by o stars with a minimum age of @xmath43 myr ( figure 4 ) . the age of the universe for our adopted cosmology sets the upper limit on the galaxy age of 1.2 gyr .",
    "the dust extinction , as parameterized by the color excess @xmath44 , is fit with a broad range spectral energy distribution templates . from these",
    "fits it is found that any model with @xmath45 provides a poor fit to the slope of data , as the continuum becomes significantly flatter in the blue with the addition of even moderate amounts of dust .",
    "thus we restrict our parameter space to @xmath46 .    model spectral energy distributions are generated using the stellar synthesis code of @xcite .",
    "we select a chabrier initial mass function ( padova 1994 ) , stellar evolution tracks , and solar metallicity .",
    "we choose a single starburst model with a range of decay rates @xmath47 and a star formation rate ( sfr ) that depends exponentially on @xmath47 as follows : @xmath48 with @xmath49 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 1 , and 1.2 gyr .",
    "continuous star - formation models are also considered , as approximated by selecting @xmath47 to be the age of the universe at @xmath20 , and we do not consider more complicated star formation histories . for each @xmath47 , three parameters remain to be fit to the data : age @xmath50 , @xmath44 , and stellar mass @xmath51 . a suite of models are constructed over the allowable parameter space for these three variables , and each model is corrected for the effects of dust extinction @xcite , and attenuation by the intervening lyman - series forest @xcite .",
    "we compute synthetic photometry on our models by a convolution of the model spectra with the observed filter bandpass transmission functions .",
    "we compare the synthetic photometry with the observed photometric values until the lowest value of reduced @xmath52 is obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig_bc ] shows our best fit model to the joint variation of the parameters of dust extinction , age , and mass , with values : @xmath53 , @xmath54 myr , and @xmath55 .",
    "note that as the exponentially - decaying models are normalized to have a total mass of 1@xmath56 as @xmath57 , we obtain the mass for @xmath9 by the flux normalization that yields the lowest value for the reduced @xmath52 fit .",
    "our best fit is for a no - dust model .",
    "we compute formal @xmath52 uncertainties that represent 68 % uncertainties for our input model .",
    "we follow the prescription in @xcite originally developed for use with x - ray spectral data that allows for the joint estimation of confidence intervals .    the best fit synthetic spectrum is also shown in figure  2 in the main text , but _ without _ corrections for dust extinction and absorption by the intervening ly@xmath3 forest .",
    "this intrinsic form is used to define the unabsorbed continuum level @xmath26 for @xmath9 against which the flux transmission of the ly@xmath3 forest is measured .",
    "despite the strong magnification , the intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is not high ; we measure an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath58 ergs s@xmath11 hz@xmath11 , and an unlensed @xmath59 , two magnitudes fainter than @xmath60 at @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "galaxies at @xmath62 are faint , and hence only a few high quality spectra exist ( price et al . 2007 ; kawai et al . 2006",
    "; dow - hygelund et al . 2007 ; franx et al .",
    "some of these are at @xmath63 where @xmath27 is expected to be high ( from the qso measurements ) , but the spectrum of the gamma - ray burst grb060510b at @xmath64 ( price et al .",
    "2007 ) . shows some similar characteristics to the spectrum of @xmath9 .",
    "the igm transmission measured over a broad redshift bin of the former is @xmath65 , similar to the values observed toward qsos .",
    "however , this broad average smears out the structure in @xmath27 as a function of redshift .",
    "the grb060510b spectrum shows evidence of higher than expected gp optical depth extending beyond the region affected by the damped ly@xmath3 absorption at the redshift of the grb host .",
    "it would be interesting to reanalyze this grb spectrum using smaller redshift bins .",
    "h  i opacities were also measured inside the proximity zones of qsos ; although significantly ionized , the proximity zones are found to have neutral hydrogen fractions that exceed theoretical expectations .",
    "this indicates that at least some qsos are also found in regions of gaseous overdensity with large sizes of @xmath66mpc @xcite",
    ".    might @xmath9 still be in the process of accreting much of its mass from its overdense surrounding cosmic structure ?",
    "theoretical models predict that h  i gas is funneled into young galaxies via large - scale filamentary structures @xcite .",
    "we have presented here observational evidence that h  i column densities are higher than expected near one high - redshift galaxy . based on the large physical size implied by the h  i excess , it is unlikely that this gas will accrete onto a single galaxy .",
    "alternatively , post - starburst galaxies are known to drive high - velocity outflows with velocities of @xmath67 km s@xmath11 in low - ionization stages such as mg  ii @xcite . given sufficient time ,",
    "the observed excess of h  i optical depth could be explained by such an outflow ; however @xmath9 is too young by a significant factor given the best fit stellar age of 100@xmath68 myr .",
    "on the other hand , qsos are known to drive outflows with terminal velocities in excess of @xmath69 km s@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath9 does not show obvious signatures of being an agn , but even if there was a low - metallicity outflow undetected in our spectrum , the velocities would still fall short by more than a factor of ten of that required to explain the h  i excess .",
    "as more data become available to study the neutral h  i absorption towards the several recently discovered strongly - lensed lbgs , it may be found to be typical for high - redshift objects , both galaxies _ and _ qsos , to be located in regions of space with neutral hydrogen gas fractions significantly larger than that of the pervasive igm .",
    "this re - evaluation of the h  i structure in the densest regions of the universe at these epochs will provide the necessary calibration for modeling the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe .",
