    "bismut was the first one who introduced concepts of stochastic geometric mechanics , in his article from 1981 , when he defined the notion of `` stochastic hamiltonian system '' .",
    "he showed that that the stochastic flow of certain randomly perturbed hamiltonian systems on flat spaces extremizes a stochastic action , and using this property , he proved symplecticity and the noether theorem for stochastic hamiltonian systems . since then , there has been a need in to find out tools and algorithms for the study of this kind of systems with uncertainty .",
    "bismut s work was continued by lazaro - cami and ortega ( [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] ) , in the sense that his work was generalized to manifolds .",
    "stochastic hamiltonian systems on manifolds extremize a stochastic action on the space of manifold valued semimartingales , the reduction of stochastic hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle of a lie group , a counter example for the converse of bismut s original theorem . very important in many scientific domains is fractional calculus : fractional derivatives , fractional integrals , of any real or complex order .",
    "fractional calculus is used when fractional integration is needed .",
    "it is used for studying simple dynamical systems , but it also describes complex physical systems .",
    "for example , applications of the fractional calculus can be found in chaotic dynamics , control theory , stochastic modelling , but also in finance , hydrology , biophysics , physics , astrophysics , cosmology , economics and so on ( [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ) . but some other fields have just started to study problems from fractional point of view .",
    "it is very fashionable to study the fractional problems of the calculus of variations and euler - lagrange type equations .",
    "the most famous fractional integrals are riemann - liouville , caputo , grunwald - letnikov and the most frequently used is the riemann - liouville fractional integral .",
    "the study of euler - lagrange fractional equations was continued by agrawal ( [ 1 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] ) that described these equations using the left , respectively right fractional derivatives in the riemann - liouville sense .",
    "standard multi - variable variational calculus also has some limitations .",
    "but in [ 13 ] , c.udriste and d. opris showed that these limitations can by broken using the multi - linear control theory . in [ 7 ] the novel concepts of fractional action - like variational approach ( falva ) with time - dependent fractional exponent and exponential time - dependent term is introduced . in this paper , we restrict our attention to stochastic generalized fractional hamiltonian systems characterized by wiener processes and assume that the space of admissible curves in configuration space is of class @xmath0 .",
    "random effects appear in the balance of momentum equations , as white noise , that is why we may consider randomly perturbed mechanical systems .",
    "it should be mentioned that the ideas in this paper can be readily extended to stochastic hamiltonian systems driven by more general semimartingales , but for the sake of clarity we restrict ourselves to wiener processes . in this paper",
    "we use the generalized left fractional riemann - liouville integral defined as a mixture of the fractal action from physics and the discounted action at rate @xmath1 , given in [ 7 ] . within this context , the results of the paper are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the paper presents the results from [ 3 ] which show that almost surely that a curve satisfies stochastic hp equations if and only if it extremizes a stochastic action .",
    "suggestive examples and numerical simulations are done .",
    "generalized fractional hp equations are described using the generalized fractional riemann - liouville integral and the fractional it integral ;    \\3 .",
    "langevian type stochastic generalized fractional equations are obtained in the case of a hyperregular lagrange function .",
    "relevant examples and numerical simulations are presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , hamilton - pontryagin ( hp ) principle is given to the stochastic setting to prove that a class of mechanical systems with multiplicative noise appearing as forces and torques possess a variational structure .",
    "for a hyperregular lagrange function , we get the stochastic hamiltonian equations that lead to langevin equations .",
    "examples and numerical simulations for the lagrangian which describes the samuelson model from economics [ 5 ] are given . in section 3",
    ", we extend the generalized fractional hamilton - pontryagin ( hp ) principle to the stochastic setting to prove that a class of mechanical systems with multiplicative noise appearing as forces and torques possesses a variational structure . for a hyperregular lagrange function ,",
    "we obtain the stochastic generalized fractional hamiltonian equations that lead to langevin generalized fractional equations . for a lagrange function , defined on @xmath2 ,",
    "the corresponding generalized fractional langevin equations are simulated .",
    "the generalized fractional hamiltonian and the lagrangian description are joined together to get the generalized fractional hp system .",
    "in this section a variational principe is introduced for a class of stochastic hamilton systems on manifolds .",
    "the stochastic action is a sum of the classical action and stochastic integral .",
    "the key feature of this principle is that one can recover stochastic hamilton equations for these systems . roughly speaking , this",
    "is accomplished by means of taking variations of this action within the space of curve only ( not the probability space ) and imposing the condition that this partial differential of the action must be zero .",
