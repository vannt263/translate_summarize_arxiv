    "ngc5466 is a metal - poor halo cluster located at @xmath0  kpc from the sun ( cassisi et al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath1  kpc above the galactic plane ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "it is one of the less luminous clusters in the globular cluster system of our galaxy .",
    "it has a low central velocity dispersion of only 1.5  kms@xmath2 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) and a relatively large core radius ( @xmath3  pc , lehmann & scholz 1997 ) .",
    "this implies a dynamical mass of about @xmath4 ( pryor et al .",
    "the internal properties of ngc5466 are thus similar to - though less extreme than - those of the low - mass halo cluster palomar5 , which was recently found to have long tails of tidal debris ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) that reveal ongoing tidal disruption .",
    "+ existing measurements of the proper motion of ngc5466 ( see odenkirchen et al .",
    "1997 ) allow us to assess its local galactic orbit .",
    "we took the available kinematic data for ngc 5466 and a model of the galactic potential developed by allen & santillan ( 1991 ) and integrated the equations of motion to @xmath5  myr from present .",
    "the resulting orbit is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "it demonstrates that ngc5466 is on a highly eccentric orbit with @xmath6  kpc , but has crossed the galactic disk about 50  myr ago at a distance of about 8  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "this suggests that ngc5466 has recently undergone a tidal shock , which - due to the low mass and low concentration of this cluster - might lead to a significant loss of stars .",
    "we analysed the spatial distribution of stars in the outer parts of ngc5466 using data from the apm catalogue .",
    "this catalogue is based on scans of the first palomar sky survey ( poss - i ) o and e plates .",
    "we extracted a @xmath7 field centered on the cluster and selected all sources classified as `` starlike '' . to weed out stars that are most likely not associated with the cluster we restricted the sample to the color - magnitude box defined by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this selects stars on the upper main sequence and near the main - sequence turn - off of ngc5466 .",
    "since the photometry obtained from the poss - i plates is of moderate accuracy , the selection necessarily is rather coarse .",
    "+ fig.2 shows the distribution of the selected cluster member candidates on the sky .",
    "while the inner part of the cluster appears spherical , there is a stellar halo around it , which has a non - spherical shape .",
    "this halo appears elongated towards the south - west and the north - east , i.e. , stars are seen preferentially near the directions towards the galactic center ( see dashed line in fig.1 ) and anticenter .",
    "the orientation of this cluster halo is further analysed in fig.3 , where we plot star counts in the range @xmath10 as a function of position angle .",
    "the position angle of the major - axis of the cluster s halo is about + 30  while the position angle of the galactic center - anticenter line is + 43  .",
    "this provides first evidence for a possible tidal perturbation of the cluster and eventual mass loss because the galactic tidal field will drag stars away from the cluster along the center - anticenter line ( see , e.g. , the example of pal5 in odenkirchen et al .  2003 ) .",
    "however , the apm data do not allow to trace cluster members to more than @xmath11 from the center of ngc5466 .",
    "thus deeper and more accurate photometry is needed to explore the distribution of cluster stars in more detail .",
    "fig.4 shows a prediction of the spread of tidal debris from ngc5466 .",
    "we simulated tidal mass loss from the cluster by releasing particles from the lagrange points located on the galactic centre - anticenter line in time steps of 10  myr .",
    "the particles were assumed to have peculiar velocities of size 1.5  kms@xmath2 ( equal to the measured velocity dispersion of the cluster ) .",
    "the dots show the present location of particles released @xmath12  myrs ago .",
    "stars lost during the last 50 myrs , i.e. , after the cluster s recent disk crossing , are highlighted as fat dots .",
    "the distribution of the fat dots is similar to the observed halo of cluster member candidates around ngc5466 .",
    "the orientation of the observed halo is compatible with a transition from the center - anticenter line towards alignment with the cluster s orbit .",
    "deeper and cleaner data might allow to resolve the sharp bending near the lagrange points suggested by the simulation .",
