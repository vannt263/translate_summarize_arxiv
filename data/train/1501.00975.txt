    "quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillators have proved useful for the analysis of the vibration - rotation spectra of polyatomic molecules@xcite .",
    "several aspects of such spectra as well as other molecular properties have been modelled by means of simple coupled oscillators mainly with cubic and quartic anharmonicities@xcite .",
    "these and other applications of the ubiquitous quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillators motivated their study and the development of suitable methods for the treatment of the corresponding eigenvalue equations@xcite .",
    "the list of papers just mentioned is far from being exhaustive and its purpose is merely to give an idea of the interest aroused by the anharmonic oscillators along the years .",
    "some authors have taken into account the symmetry of the anharmonic oscillators in order to simplify their treatment@xcite and others resorted to the more formal point group symmetry ( pgs ) to classify the vibrational states@xcite . despite the great amount of information provided by pgs none of those papers",
    "exhibits a full application of such mathematical tool , except the analysis of two - dimensional cubic and quartic oscillators by pullen and edmonds@xcite .",
    "these papers motivated a recent application of pgs to a variety of hermitian@xcite and non - hermitian anharmonic oscillators with space - time symmetry@xcite . in the latter case pgs proved suitable for determining the conditions that complex anharmonic potentials should satisfy in order to support real eigenvalues .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reinforce the idea that pgs is most important in the study of quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillators because we deem that such technique has been surprisingly overlooked or disregarded ( except for the few works already mentioned above@xcite ) .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model , a quartic anharmonic oscillator with considerably large symmetry described by the point group @xmath0 .",
    "this problem was treated before by means of perturbation theory and a less formal approach to symmetry based on parity and coordinate - permutation operations@xcite . here",
    "we classify the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian according to the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of that point group and predict the rupture of the degeneracy by the quartic perturbation . in section  [ sec : perturbation ]",
    "we apply perturbation theory through second order to verify the splitting of the eigenspaces predicted in the preceding section . in section  [ sec : rayleigh - ritz ] we discuss the application of the rayleigh - ritz variational method with basis sets adapted to the symmetry of the problem . in three consecutive subsections",
    "we discuss the harmonic oscillator basis set , the krylov space and a non - orthogonal basis set .",
    "we show results illustrating the splitting of the unperturbed eigenspaces due to the quartic perturbation that breaks the symmetry of the system . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results of the paper and draw conclusions . finally , in the [ sec : appendix ] we outline the main features of group theory that are necessary for the analysis of the present problem .",

    "the author stated that his classification based on parity and permutation operators was incomplete . in this paper",
    "we describe the symmetry properties of this model by means of the point group @xmath0@xcite . in other words ,",
    "this hamiltonian operator is invariant with respect to the symmetry operations indicated in the table of characters shown in table  [ tab : oh ] described in the [ sec : appendix ] . a detailed discussion of the construction of the matrix representation of the symmetry operations for the @xmath0 point group is available elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath3 and eigenfunctions @xmath4 of @xmath5 are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an eigenfunction of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath8 .",
    "every energy level is @xmath9-fold degenerate , where @xmath10 .    throughout this paper",
    "we resort to the following notation for the permutation of a set of three real numbers @xmath11 where it is assumed that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "it enables us to express the symmetry of the unperturbed eigenfunctions ( @xmath15 ) as @xmath16    the anharmonic part of the potential reduces the symmetry of the system and the degeneracy of the energy levels is consequently diminished when @xmath17 causing a splitting of the energy levels . for the lowest ones",
    "this splitting is given by @xmath18 this equation tells us that the lowest energy level is nondegenerate , the first excited energy level remains three - fold degenerate , the second excited energy level splits into a singlet a doublet and a triplet , the third excited energy level splits into a singlet and three triples ( two of them of the same symmetry @xmath19 ) , etc .",
    "note the alternating parity ( either @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) given by @xmath22 .    for simplicity , in this paper we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath23 .",
    "this choice reduces the number of parameters in the potential - energy function but alters neither the symmetry of the problem nor the main conclusions drawn from it .",
    "the purpose of this section is merely to carry out a simple calculation based on perturbation theory in order to verify the splitting of the energy levels outlined by equation ( [ eq : splitting ] ) .",
    "there are several strategies for obtaining the perturbation corrections when @xmath24 exhibits degenerate states . here",
    "we simply obtain the first two perturbation corrections by inserting the truncated expansion @xmath25 into the characteristic polynomial given by the secular determinant @xmath26 and then solving the resulting equation for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this apparently impractical brute - force approach is sufficient for present purposes ; the only subtlety being that each irrep is treated separately as discussed in section  [ sec : rayleigh - ritz ] ( in particular with the basis set of subsection  [ subsec : non - orth_basis ] ) . for the first energy levels we obtain the following results @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 which are consistent with the prediction of group theory shown in equation ( [ eq : splitting ] )",
    ". it is worth noting that the degeneracy of the pairs of energy levels @xmath33 and @xmath34 breaks at second order ( the correction of first order being identical ) .",
    "however , such states offer no difficulty because we can treat each member of the pair separate from the other because they belong to different symmetry species .",
    "this strategy is one of the advantages of a possible systematic application of group theory to perturbation theory .",
    "this approach is based on a variational ansatz given by a finite linear combination of functions of a basis set @xmath35 : @xmath36 the variational coefficients @xmath37 are chosen so that the variational integral @xmath38 is a minimum .",
    "the condition @xmath39 leads to the secular equations @xmath40 from which we obtain the coefficients @xmath37 and approximate energies @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "this result is valid for orthogonal as well as non - orthogonal basis functions @xmath43 , provided that in the latter case the functions are linearly independent .",
    "this approach always yields increasingly tighter upper bounds because @xmath44@xcite .",
    "if the system exhibits symmetry it is convenient to choose a suitable basis set @xmath45 for each irrep @xmath46 . in order to obtain it",
    "we apply the projection operator @xmath47 ( see the [ sec : appendix ] for more details ) to every @xmath48 and then remove the linearly dependent functions from the resulting set @xmath49 .",
    "one advantage of using the basis sets @xmath50 is that the dimension of the secular equations for a given accuracy is considerably smaller .",
    "thus , instead of equations ( [ eq : psi_ansatz ] ) and ( [ eq : secular_gen ] ) we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 for each irrep @xmath46 . in this case",
    "we obtain upper bounds for each irrep exactly in the same way as before : @xmath53 .",
    "one of the most convenient basis sets consists of linear combinations of eigenfunctions of @xmath24 adapted to the symmetry of @xmath54 . in this case",
    "the variational method reduces to diagonalizing the matrix representation of the hamiltonian @xmath55 in each orthonormal basis set @xmath56 adapted to the corresponding symmetry species @xmath46 .",
    "we thus obtain approximate eigenvalues @xmath57 and eigenfunctions @xmath58 that are linear combinations of the form @xmath59 the coefficients @xmath60 and the approximate eigenvalues @xmath57 are given by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath55 , respectively , and are also solutions of a secular equation similar to ( [ eq : sec_gen_s ] ) .",

    "we do not investigate this fact any further in this paper and just mention it in passing .",
