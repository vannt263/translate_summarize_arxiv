    "madan and seneta  @xcite introduced the univariate `` variance gamma '' ( @xmath0 ) process as a model for a financial asset price process with a special view to more accurate option pricing on the asset , beyond the standard geometric brownian motion ( @xmath1 ) model .",
    "the @xmath0 model has proved to be outstandingly successful in this application , and is in common use by many financial institutions , as an alternative to the @xmath1 model , despite failing to cater for stochastic volatility or a leverage effect , or allowing for temporal dependence of absolute values and/or squares of log returns .",
    "nevertheless , madan and seneta extended the @xmath0 model  @xcite to a multi - asset version , again with a view to important applications in finance (  rainbow options \" ) , by subordinating a multivariate brownian motion with a single univariate gamma process ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "this construction leaves the marginal processes as univariate variance gamma processes .",
    "but , components are dependent by virtue of the common time change .",
    "semeraro  @xcite generalises the multi - asset version of madan and seneta  @xcite to allow for multivariate subordination .",
    "this permits the dependence structure between asset prices to be modeled in a more flexible way .",
    "the economic intuition behind multivariate subordination is that each asset may have an idiosyncratic risk with its own activity time and a common risk factor , with a joint activity time for all assets . in specific cases it is possible to maintain @xmath0 processes for each single asset ,",
    "see  @xcite and related applications in luciano and semeraro @xcite , though this may be sacrificed for more flexible dependence modeling , as in guillaume  @xcite .",
    "ballotta and bonfiglioni  @xcite give an up - to - date account of modeling based on lvy processes in finance .",
    "to summarize , a wide range of multi - asset models based on univariate or multivariate gamma subordination of a brownian motion has been proposed . however , there are still gaps in the literature concerning the characterization in general of classes of processes when the class is required to be stable under convolution .",
    "further , theoretical results such as formulae for characteristic functions , lvy measures and , when possible , transition densities , are needed for a comprehensive description of key properties .    as a prominent link between the real - world and the risk - neutral measure",
    "so as to obtain an equivalent martingale measure , we advocate the esscher transform .",
    "this approach has been rigorously investigated in the seminal papers of kallsen and shiryaev  @xcite and eberlein , papapantoleon and shiryaev  @xcite .",
    "esche and schweizer  @xcite show that the minimal entropy martingale measure for a multivariate lvy process preserves the lvy property because it corresponds to an esscher transform .",
    "rschendorf and wolf  @xcite provide explicit necessary conditions for the existence of esscher parameters for multivariate lvy processes and further show that the multivariate esscher parameter is unique if it exists .",
    "tankov  @xcite provides an introduction to the pricing theory in the context of exponential lvy processes .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to contribute to filling the above gaps by presenting a general class of @xmath2-valued stochastic processes , constructed by subordinating multivariate brownian motion with a subordinator drawn from a suitable class of multivariate subordinators .",
    "our intention is to lay out a systematic formulation suitable for future development . for the new processes",
    ", we provide the formulae mentioned in the previous paragraph and link the real world and pricing measures by calculating esscher transforms . to illustrate the practical possibilities ,",
    "we show how the explicit formulae can be used to price american and european multi - asset options .",
    "the most general class of subordinators we consider is thorin s  @xcite class of _ generalised gamma convolutions_. we call it the @xmath3 class of subordinators , and the process formed by subordinating brownian motion in @xmath2 with such a process we call a _ variance generalised gamma convolution _",
    "( @xmath4 ) process .",
    "grigelionis  @xcite constructed such a vgg - class , which we call @xmath5 in the present paper .",
    "the @xmath5 class contains madan - seneta s @xmath0 as well as the multivariate generalised hyperbolic distributions  @xcite as special cases . complementing grigelionis @xmath5 class , we introduce the @xmath6 class of lvy processes .",

    "the general @xmath8 class extends the @xmath0 classes in a number of ways .",

    "as we will show , they facilitate construction of a very general class of subordinators and corresponding multivariate lvy processes obtained as subordinated @xmath10dimensional brownian motions .",
    "our new class complements  @xcite , and contains a number of currently known versions of multivariate @xmath0 processes , and extends them significantly in a variety of important ways .",
    "although rather technical in appearance , our approach is very much directed toward practical usage of the methodology .",
    "explicit expressions for characteristic functions or laplace transforms , and lvy measures or densities , are derived and exhibited for all our processes .",
    "this permits easy programming of option pricing routines as we demonstrate by an example , focusing in particular on the pricing of american style options on a bivariate underlying ; a thorny problem not often tackled in this context .",
    "the @xmath4-class and some of its subclasses are shown to be invariant under esscher transformation , so the risk - neutral distribution constructed as the esscher transformation of a particular member is also in the @xmath4-class with the practical implication that it is possible to calculate prices under the risk - neutral measure and estimate model parameters by calibrating to market data . using these concepts , we set up a market model and show how an option based on multiple assets may be priced . for illustration",
    "we restrict ourselves in this respect to a further subclass of the @xmath4-class which we term the @xmath11-processes .",
    "models in this class have the virtue of allowing a quite general dependency structure between the coordinate processes . as an example",
