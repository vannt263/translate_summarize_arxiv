    "the hadronic @xmath1 decays serves as an ideal laboratory for testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in a relatively low energy regime . in the past",
    ", various techniques ( fixed order perturbation theory , contour improved perturbation theory , effective charge approach , renormalons , dispersive approach ) have been devised to improve the reliability of the predictions of the theory for the @xmath1 system . in this boundary area of the energy ,",
    "perturbative ideas are still applicable due to relatively large mass of the @xmath1 lepton , while non - perturbative effects are expected to be small .",
    "usually , they are under control within wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that the main calculational tool in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) the renormalization group improved perturbation theory augmented with the ope can not be used locally in the time - like region even at high energy .",
    "fortunately , this problem has been resolved in earlier work @xcite by means of the idea of the quark - hadron duality .",
    "this enabled one to employ the qcd perturbation theory in minkowski region to calculate some global ( inclusive ) quantities like @xmath1 lepton decay rate . although the quark - hadron duality can not be justified rigorously from the first principles , in practice this idea works good enough . using the duality ,",
    "an accurate description of the @xmath1 lepton decay data was achieved ( see the seminal work @xcite and the literature therein ) .",
    "however , one should always keep in mind that the duality between a physical quantity and its quark - gluon perturbation theory representation is only approximative and thus it must inevitable be violated ( see the review @xcite and the literature therein ) . to identify general mechanism of possible duality violations ( dvs ) , special qcd inspired models for the hadronic spectral functions ( e.g. the instanton - based and resonance - based models @xcite as well as the models motivated by the large @xmath9 limit of the theory @xcite ) have been studied . in these models",
    "dvs in fact occur .",
    "presumably , dvs arise due to the lack of the convergence of the ope on the minkowski axis .",
    "if this is the case , then the analytical continuation of the truncated ope series from the euclidean region to the physical axis is questionable @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the accuracy of the measurements of the observables of the @xmath1 lepton system has been essentially improved ( for the recent results of the aleph collaboration see @xcite ) .",
    "this enables one to extract the parameters of the standard model from @xmath1 data with very high precision .",
    "of particular interest is the numerical value of the strong coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "admittedly , one of the most precise determinations of the strong coupling constant comes from the analysis of the @xmath1 data ( for most recent results see @xcite ) .",
    "an independent low - energy highest - precession determination of @xmath0 comes from lattice qcd simulations combined with experimental data for hadron masses @xcite .",
    "these two highest - precision determinations extrapolated to the z mass yield @xmath10 note that the agreement between these two results , with the errors quoted , is not good .",
    "they differ from each other by about 2.6 standard deviations .",
    "furthermore , the lattice determination is closer to @xmath11 values obtained from high energy experiments .",
    "thus , the reliability of the estimates from the @xmath1-lepton data has been called in question @xcite .",
    "the small but still significant non - perturbative effects have been included into analysis @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the impact of the higher order terms of the ope ( neglected in the standard analyzes ) has been estimated @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that their influence on the extracted value of @xmath0 is not small in the separate vector and axial vector channels . to suppress these contributions in the finite energy sum rule the so - called pinched weights introduced @xcite .",
    "an independent estimation of possible non - perturbaive corrections to the finite energy sum rele ( direct instantons , duality violation and tachyonic gluon mass ) which can not be described within ope can be found in @xcite . to estimate systematic effects from dvs ,",
    "recently the authors of @xcite have analyzed the aleph @xmath1 data for the v+a spectral function using two different models of dvs .",
    "these models were previously considered in @xcite . it was confirmed ( within this models ) that dvs effects in this channel are completely negligible .",
    "however , this problem has been reconsidered in @xcite . there the separate vector ( v ) and axial - vector ( a ) spectral data have been analyzed .",
    "to describe dvs coming from the region @xmath12 physically motivated models for these spectral functions have been suggested . analyzing the @xmath1 data provided by the aleph collaboration , the authors of @xcite have concluded that dvs are not small .",
    "an additional systematic error in the value of the coupling constant coming from dvs has been estimated on the level @xmath13 .",
    "as is well known , in the time - like region the renormalization group ( rg ) invariance can not be used unambiguously .",
    "usually , the qcd corrections to the @xmath1 lepton decay rate @xmath14 is expressed via the contour integral of the associated adler function multiplied by the known weight function .",
    "this representation is valid owing to special analyticity structure of the corresponding exact current - current correlation function .",
    "the adler function is represented via the truncated perturbation theory series and the integral is taken over the circle of radius @xmath15 ( @xmath16 stands for the @xmath1-lepton mass ) in the complex energy squared plane @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to integrate term - by - term the truncated perturbation theory series over the contour and then perform the rg improvement .",
    "this approach is referred to as fixed order perturbation theory ( fopt ) .",
    "alternatively , one can insert the rg improved truncated series for the adler function inside the contour integral and then perform the integral .",
    "this approach suggested in @xcite was termed contour improved perturbation theory ( cipt ) .",
    "the advantage of cipt is that it enables to resume some higher - order contributions to the rate .",
    "these two approaches lead to differing results .",
    "the values of @xmath0 extracted from @xmath1 decays employing cipt have always been higher .",
    "a detailed comparison of these two approaches may be found in recent works @xcite .",
    "a practical review of various approaches to the @xmath1 decay rate may be found in @xcite .",
    "the inclusive quantity like hadronic @xmath1 decay rate may be accurately described within pure perturbative approach , provided the dvs are small .",
    "indeed , in the v+a channel , the nonperturbative power suppressed contributions described by the ope ( continued analytically to the time - like region ) have been estimated to be small @xcite .",
    "however , the large value of the running coupling parameter at the @xmath1 lepton mass scale leads to the large renormalization scheme dependence of perturbative predictions . to reduce this dependence various resummation techniques",
    "have been developed ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the v+a @xmath1-lepton decay data was analyzed within a modified extraction procedure based on the effective charge approach .",
    "the numerical analysis has been performed in the internal renormalization scheme of the @xmath1 system and then the result was translated into the @xmath17 scheme using renormalization scheme transformation . this procedure yields smaller value for the coupling constant .",
    "similarly , in @xcite and @xcite in calculations of the @xmath1 decay rate the minimal sensitivity and effective charge schemes were used . in this way the reliability of the estimates for the coupling constant has been improved .",
    "a serious shortcoming of the conventional perturbation theory approximations to the current - current correlation functions parameterized in terms of the running coupling is that they do not obey correct analytical properties of the corresponding exact quantities .",
    "the analytical properties are violated due to the non - physical landau singularities of the perturbative running coupling which appear at small space - like momenta ( for the analytical structure of the perturbative coupling beyond the one - loop order see @xcite ) .",
    "supposedly , these singularities may deteriorate the extracted values of the parameters @xcite .",
    "this problem does not arise within dispersive or analytic approaches to pqcd . at present ,",
    "several such approaches are being intensively developed @xcite . in works",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the @xmath1 lepton decay rate has been analyzed within a simple and effective dispersive technique , the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the minimal analytic qcd model ( the same apt ) predicts , from the non - strange @xmath1 lepton decay data , too large value for the strong coupling constant , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the advantages and shortcomings of the three approaches to the @xmath1 decays ( fopt , cipt and apt ) were thoroughly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the apt as well as its generalized versions suggested more later @xcite proved to be very useful from the phenomenological point of view . a remarkable feature of these modified expansions is the better convergence and improved stability property with respect to change of the renormalization scheme .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that an analytic approach based only on perturbation theory can not be defined unambiguously , since there is not a unique recipe for removing the landau singularities from the running coupling .",
    "a particular problem emerges from the observation that the qcd perturbation theory augmented with the ope fail to describe the detailed infrared behavior of the adler function associated with the @xmath1 decay rate @xcite . to treat this problem",
    "a more general framework is required .",

    "our aim is to utilize the total information encoded in this representation .",
    "we recall that the authors of @xcite have used _ ansatz _ ( [ gd ] ) to extract the numerical value for the parameter @xmath5 from the experimental data . for the @xmath6 scheme scale parameter ( for the three active flavours )",
    "they used the estimate @xmath28 the qcd component of the spectral function , @xmath29 , was determined from the order @xmath30 approximation to the adler function .",
