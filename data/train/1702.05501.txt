    "photon pairs from nonlinear optics are so far the only resource to have distributed quantum entanglement over more than a few kilometers  @xcite , a critical link in future quantum networks , and are well - suited for use in multi - port quantum interferometers for sensing , simulation and computation , both as pairs directly and for heralded single photons  @xcite . entangled photon pairs have also been used in quantum teleportation  @xcite and entanglement swapping  @xcite .",
    "these applications require spectrally pure photons : mixedness of the photon states leads to reduced visibility of the interference of independent photons , and therefore lower - quality final states .",
    "parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) are the most common sources of photon pairs , and these photons usually possess spectral anti - correlation .",
    "this frequency entanglement can be useful for some applications  @xcite , but is catastrophic for multi - photon interference or entanglement - swapping experiments .",
    "a convenient solution is narrowband filtering of both photons , which casts each into a single spectral mode , removing entanglement in favor of the spectral purity of each photon .",
    "both fwm sources  @xcite and pdc sources  @xcite often use filters much narrower than the photon bandwidths . but is spectral filtering compatible also with high symmetric heralding efficiency , that is , high probability of detecting either photon given detection of its partner ?",
    "high heralding efficiency is critical for scaling experiments and communications to many photons and higher rates  @xcite due to the exponential increase in losses with number of photons , and also of fundamental importance : for reaching scalability in optical quantum computing  @xcite , in device - independent quantum cryptography  @xcite , and for tests of local causality with entangled photons  @xcite .",
    "here we show that , for photon pair sources with spectral correlation or anti - correlation , increasing the spectral purity comes at a direct cost of decreasing the symmetric heralding efficiency .",
    "this tradeoff is based only on the joint spectral intensity ( jsi ) of the photons , not on the underlying physics that produce a specific jsi , meaning our results are applicable to both pdc and fwm , and to pulsed and continuous - wave pumps .",
    "we find a significant drop in achievable symmetric heralding efficiency even with ideal filters .",
    "we quantify this tradeoff by introducing the symmetric fidelity of the photon pairs to two pure single photons , and show that it is bounded well below one for spectrally - correlated sources .",
    "this is supported by an experiment using a lithium niobate photon - pair source , where we vary filter parameters , and find that heralding efficiency necessarily decreases as purity increases .",
    "similar results could be obtained for spatial correlation and spatial filtering , but here we focus on a single spatial mode .",
    "previous investigations of filtering in pdc and fwm have largely focused on heralded single photons , where the herald_ing _ photon is strongly filtered and the herald_ed _ photon is unfiltered , allowing both high spectral purity and high single - sided heralding efficiency  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work has included also spatial entanglement and purity with spatial and spectral filters  @xcite , showing again high single - sided heralding efficiency and purity .",
    "this is in contrast to source engineering methods , which achieve intrinsically pure states by controlling the dispersion and pump bandwidth  @xcite .",
    "some schemes with tight spectral and time filtering can even outperform this source engineering , when considering production rates as well as purity  @xcite . for the case where both photons are to be used , hints that filtering is incompatible with high symmetric heralding efficiency have appeared numerous times  @xcite , but so far no experiments have directly studied the impact of filtering on purity and heralding efficiency simultaneously .",
    "one can get a feeling for the intrinsic tradeoff between purity and heralding efficiency from [ fig.intro ] . it shows the joint spectral intensity of an example photon pair state , overlaid with narrowband filters on each photon , labeled signal and idler . to achieve a spectrally pure state , the jsi that remains after filtering",
    "must be uncorrelated between the two photons , either a circle , or an ellipse along the vertical or horizontal axis .",
    "but for high symmetric heralding efficiency , the two - photon amplitudes transmitted by each filter individually must overlap , otherwise signal photons will pass the filter without the corresponding idler and vice versa .",
    "purity can also be achieved by narrowband filtering just one photon , which decreases the heralding efficiency only for that photon .",
    "is multiplied by the pump envelope ( which always has angle ) to produce the total jsi .",
    "thus the overall angle of the jsi is somewhere between and @xmath0 . ]",
    "an uncorrelated jsi , fully contained within both filters is only possible for certain ranges of the phasematching angle , namely @xmath1 $ ] , and with a pump bandwidth optimized for the phasematching bandwidth .",
    "but these conditions are precisely those for which filtering is not required , since there are no underlying spectral correlations in this condition . furthermore",
    ", achieving a phasematching angle in this range is nontrivial , as it requires the group velocity of the pump to be between that of the signal and idler .",
    "this source engineering is only possible  @xcite in pdc for very specific wavelength ranges in birefringent crystals  @xcite .",
    "it is easier to arrange in fwm since it occurs naturally for normal dispersion with the pump between the signal and idler frequencies ( here the frequencies are rather close , necessitating narrow filtering for pump removal ) , or by pumping near the zero - dispersion wavelength  @xcite or using birefringent fibers  @xcite .    as a concrete example we consider waveguided type - ii pdc wherein",
    "the photons are emitted in a single spatial mode but with different polarizations .",
    "these sources can be easily transformed to entangled - pair sources with sagnac  @xcite or mach - zehnder  @xcite interferometers . at low enough pump powers to stay in the single - pair regime ,",
    "the spectral properties of pdc are governed by the joint spectral amplitude @xmath2 for signal and idler frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , giving rise to the photon pair state  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a single photon at frequency @xmath7 with the polarization of the signal / idler mode and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are spectral filters on the signal and idler photons respectively .",
    "the joint spectral intensity is @xmath10 , and the filters can be of any shape : we consider square and gaussian filters .",
    "we model the joint spectral amplitude as the product of pump and phasematching functions around central frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath13\\sin{\\theta } + \\left[\\omega_i-\\omega_{i0}\\right]\\cos{\\theta}\\right)}{2\\sigma_{pm}}\\right)\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exponential term governs the range of energies provided by the pump beam of bandwidth @xmath14 and thus the degree of signal - idler anticorrelation , while the sinc term dictates the phasematching of bandwidth @xmath15 , which depends on the crystal length and dispersion .",
    "@xmath16 is a normalization term .",
    "the phasematching angle @xmath0 is given by the group velocities of the pump , signal , and idler , which are assumed constant over the relevant bandwidths .",
    "for collinear pdc or fwm the phasematching angle  @xcite is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the frequency derivative of the wavenumber @xmath19 of mode @xmath20 . thus the nonlinear material , waveguide characteristics , and wavelengths",
    "can all be chosen to determine the phasematching angle .",
    "below we examine the effect of the filter and pump bandwidths and the phasematching angle on the purity and heralding efficiency of filtered pdc .",
    "while the experiment uses square filters , the effects are also seen analytically for gaussian filters , as derived in the supplemental material below .",
    "we define the signal photon s _ filter heralding efficiency _ as the probability that the signal photon passes its filter given that the idler photon has passed its filter , and vice versa for the idler photon s filter heralding efficiency",
    ". these efficiencies will be less than one whenever the jsis passed by each filter individually do not match . defining the probability that both photons pass their filters as @xmath21 and the probability that each passes individually as @xmath22",
    ", we find the signal s filter heralding efficiency is @xmath23 and the idler s is @xmath24    the spectral purity of the state given the detection of both photons is  @xcite @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the reduced density matrix . the purity can be taken for either signal or idler as there is no other degree of freedom that would allow different purities for each mode and we are always considering that the photons are detected in coincidence .",
    "taking the jsi of [ fig.intro ] ( with pump bandwidth , phasematching bandwidth , and @xmath27 , matching the experiment below ) , we calculate the filter heralding efficiencies and spectral purity versus filter bandwidth , which are taken as equal for the signal and idler . as seen in [ fig.filt ] , as soon as the filters are narrow enough to increase the purity , the filter heralding efficiency starts to drop .",
    "the filters are ideal flat - top filters with perfect transmission in the passband and perfect blocking otherwise .",
    "this is an idealization of real dense - wave - division multiplexing filters , chosen to highlight the intrinsic physical effects of filtering rather than the technical effects .",
    "in fact , real filters lead to even stronger reductions in heralding efficiency due to nonuniformities , slow rolloff , and nonunit transmission .",
    "gaussian filters ( thin grey curves ) show worse performance for both purity and heralding efficiency , with the improved purity at large filter bandwidths due to the removal of sinc lobes under the gaussian approximation of the jsi .",
    "the kink in [ fig.filt ] around filter bandwidth in the idler heralding efficiency is due to the asymmetry of the jsi  @xcite .",
    "even though both filters are varied equally , since the jsi is tipped slightly towards parallel to the idler axis , above the kink , the filtering is dominated by the idler filter , while below both filters contribute .",
    "( thick red ) versus phasematching angle , after optimizing the pump bandwidth ( black solid ) and the signal ( black dot - dash ) and idler ( black dash ) filter bandwidths .",
    "the maximum achievable fidelity is independent of the crystal length but the optimal values of bandwidth change to accommodate the different phasematching bandwidths .",
    "a few crystal types  @xcite for degenerate type ii pdc to are overlaid ( filled star ) , while for degenerate type 0 and type i , the phasematching angle is always ( except with engineered dispersion for example in microsctructured fibers  @xcite , or for noncollinear pdc  @xcite ) . with nondegenerate photons and other wavelengths ( see three examples at , empty star )",
    "many different angles can be reached  @xcite . below",
    "the plot are unfiltered jsis at intervals . ]    to quantify the combined effect of filtering on heralding efficiency and purity we introduce the symmetrized fidelity @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fidelity for the signal / idler to a pure single - photon state @xmath30 after heralding by the idler / signal and including the vacuum component caused by filtering losses .",
    "we symmetrize the fidelity in this way rather than taking just the signal or idler fidelity to capture the effects of filtering on both photons together .",
    "the spectral function @xmath31 is optimized for each photon to maximize the fidelity .",
    "the individual fidelities are @xmath32 either @xmath33 or @xmath34 can be made to approach one by filtering , but in general not both simultaneously .",
    "using the gaussian approximation developed in the supplemental material below which allows analytic solutions , we find the symmetrized fidelity to be related to the purity and heralding efficiency by @xmath35    by optimizing the pump and filter bandwidths for each phasematching angle we bound the maximum value of symmetrized fidelity available by filtering , as shown in [ fig.theta ] .",
    "the maximum is independent of the phasematching bandwidth ( here chosen as ) , though the optimal pump and filter bandwidths change . for our lithium niobate ( ln ) crystal with @xmath27",
    "the maximum is @xmath36 .",
    "by contrast , sources with @xmath1 $ ] can have @xmath37 even without filtering , as the optimal filter bandwidth goes to infinity .",
    "this shows clearly the futility of filtering for purity in pdc : the conditions in which filters are needed are only where filtering can not recover perfect fidelity due to lowered heralding efficiency .",
    "of course without filters in these conditions the fidelity to a pure single photon would be even lower .",
    "we stress that this fidelity bound is generic for all pdc and fwm sources ( with jsis described by the pump - times - phasematching model ) , and is thus a very powerful tool in source design .    finally , to show the sharpness of these effects we vary the filter bandwidths independently and set the pump and phasematching bandwidths to and respectively , which for @xmath27 allows an optimal symmetrized fidelity . as shown in [ fig.filters ] , the best filter heralding efficiencies for the signal photon have the largest signal filter and the smallest idler filter ; and vice versa for the idler photon .",
    "however the largest purity requires small filters on both arms , resulting in a fidelity that varies slowly over filter bandwidth and never exceeds 0.57 , falling to zero as either filter gets too narrow .",
    "$ ] , the fidelity is reasonably constant around its mean value of 0.45 , and never surpasses 0.57 . ]",
    "to confirm the tradeoff between purity and ( symmetric ) heralding efficiency , we measured the heralding efficiencies and joint spectral intensities of a photon - pair source under various filtering conditions .",
    "the source ( [ fig.intro ] ) was a type - ii periodically - poled lithium niobate waveguide , fiber pigtailed on both ends  @xcite and pumped by a ti : sapphire pulsed laser of wavelength .",
    "the laser had a pulse width of fwhm , nearly transform limited to fwhm spectral bandwidth , and coupled power resulting in a production of @xmath38  pairs / pulse before filtering .",
    "calculations for lithium niobate predict a phasematching angle of and bandwidth .",
    "the output of the source was coupled to a waveshaper 4000 ( finisar corp . ) which was used to separate the nondegenerate photons ( central wavelengths and ) and define their spectral filters .",
    "we characterize the heralding efficiency for each filter setting using the klyshko method  @xcite such that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the number of coincidences , @xmath41 are the number of signal / idler singles , and @xmath42 are the total heralding efficiencies . then we extract the filter heralding efficiency by dividing out the heralding efficiency @xmath43 when the filters are set to maximum bandwidth , which comes from nonunit coupling and detector efficiencies .",
    "thus the filter heralding efficiencies are @xmath44 we confirmed that the peak filter transmission is independent of the waveshaper s filter bandwidth down to ( limited by the resolution of our optical spectrum analyzer ) , assuring that the reduction in heralding efficiency is due to the fundamental tradeoff rather than technical imperfections ( see plot in supplemental material below ) .",
    "we characterized the purity by measuring a joint spectral intensity with a time - of - flight spectrometer  @xcite , assuming a constant phase of the joint spectrum  @xcite , and calculating @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the reduced spectral density matrix of the signal or idler photon  @xcite . using the jsi as an indicator of purity",
    "can be limited by artificial smoothing from limited spectrometer resolution and spectral phases that are not identifiable with intensity measurements .",
    "thus we have employed as high a resolution as possible , and verified numerically that the expected phases due to pump chirp are negligible .",
    "we show in [ fig.filter ] the joint spectral intensities after filtering and the corresponding purities , calculated with an additional time filter of twice the filter bandwidth to reduce technical noise from our laser s instability and limited timing resolution of our spectrometer .     give the distance from the central wavelength . ]        the purity , filter heralding efficiencies , and symmetrized fidelity are plotted in [ fig.exp ] and correspond reasonably well with the predictions after accounting for the asymmetry of our measured jsi .",
    "the limited resolution of our fiber spectrometer due to detector timing jitter tends to increase measured purities for large filters , as it rounds off sharp features of the jsi . adding our experimental detector timing jitter of to the theoretical jsi makes the predicted purity match the experiment for large filters .",
    "the remaining mismatch in the symmetrized fidelity could be due to small ripples in the waveshaper transmission .",
    "the overall trend is clear : the increase in purity comes at a direct cost of heralding efficiency , and the fidelity of the signal and idler states to pure , lossless photons can not reach unity by filtering .",
    "we have shown that spectral filtering of down - converted photons to increase purity can lead to intrinsically low symmetric heralding efficiencies , and can not increase the fidelity to a pure single photon beyond strong , general bounds .",
    "our results suggest that , if high heralding efficiency of photon pairs is important , source engineering is required to generate spectrally decorrelated states , and for noise reduction only broadband filters should be used . for example , without the reduced heralding efficiency from narrowband filtering , the rate of 10-photon entanglement in two recent experiments  @xcite could have been increased by a factor of 10 ( counting only reduced heralding efficiencies ) or a factor 100 ( counting all filtering losses ) . for heralded photon sources , care must be taken when filtering the heralded photon so as not to decrease its heralding efficiency unnecessarily .",
    "finally , the analytic expressions we developed will be useful in designing the next generation of photon pair sources , as they allow optimization of the spectral purity and heralding efficiency with and without filtering",
    ". it would be interesting in future work to design the optimal filter shape that minimizes the purity - efficiency tradeoff , or maximizes the symmetric fidelity .",

    "here we find the filter heralding efficiency , purity , and fidelity of an arbitrary ( but gaussian ) photon - pair joint spectrum , given gaussian signal and idler filters of unit transmission and central frequencies that match the photons central frequencies of @xmath47 .",
    "the amplitude bandwidths for the pump ( @xmath14 ) and phasematching ( @xmath15 ) are related to the fwhm intensity bandwidths that would be measured in the lab by @xmath48 where all bandwidths have units rad hz .",
    "these can be converted to wavelength using the central pump wavelength for @xmath14 and the central photon wavelength for @xmath15 .",
    "the filter heralding efficiency can be derived from the klyshko heralding efficiency  @xcite @xmath49 , where @xmath40 are the number of coincidences and @xmath50 the number of singles in the idler / signal arm per integration time . lumping all optical losses into @xmath51 and keeping the filtering losses separate , the coincidences and singles are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of photon pairs produced , @xmath21 is the probability that both photons pass their respective filters , and @xmath22 is the probability that the signal / idler photon passes its filter .",
    "thus the signal s filter heralding efficiency is @xmath55 and the idler s is @xmath56    to calculate the heralding efficiency , we find the probability that both photons are passed by the filter , then the probability that each photon is passed individually .",

    "we consider here only the spectral purity , neglecting vacuum and higher - order photon components .",
    "we find @xmath78 then the purity is @xmath79    how do the purity and heralding efficiency depend on each other ? to achieve high heralding efficiency requires @xmath80 , i.e. no filtering . to achieve high",
    "purity requires either @xmath81 , i.e. source engineering to bring @xmath1 $ ] and matching the interaction length and pump bandwidth , or @xmath82 , i.e. strong filtering .",
    "but for @xmath82 , at least one of @xmath83 or @xmath84 , implying at least one heralding efficiency tending to zero .    to find the symmetized fidelity we first consider the fidelity of the signal photon to an arbitrary gaussian pure single photon state , after filtering and heralding by the ( filtered ) idler photon . the pure state is @xmath85 with @xmath86 the fidelity ( in the sense of probabilities  @xcite ) is @xmath87 where @xmath88 , giving @xmath89 differentiating with respect to @xmath90 to find the state which maximizes the fidelity gives @xmath91 for the maximum fidelity @xmath92 a similar procedure for the idler yields @xmath93 combining these for the symmetrized efficiency gives @xmath94    finally we consider the purity - efficiency factor  @xcite of both photons together , which allows analytic optimization over the filter bandwidths . the factor is @xmath95 for @xmath96 , the pef can have in the best case any two of @xmath97 approach 1 , while the other approaches 0 . for the phasematching angles",

    "<S> photon pairs produced by parametric down - conversion or four - wave mixing can interfere with each other in multiport interferometers , or carry entanglement between distant nodes for use in entanglement swapping . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the photons be spectrally pure to ensure good interference , and have high and symmetric heralding efficiency to know accurately the number of photons involved and to maintain high rates as the number of photons grows . </S>",
    "<S> spectral filtering is often used to remove noise and define spectral properties ; however , the effect of spectral filtering on heralding efficiency is not usually considered . for heralded single photons high purity and single - sided heralding </S>",
    "<S> efficiency is possible , but when both photons in pair sources are filtered , we show that double - sided heralding efficiencies are strongly affected even by ideal spectral filters with 100% transmission in the passband : any improvement in purity from filtering comes at the cost of lowered heralding efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this effect with analytical and numerical results , and an experiment where we vary the photon filter bandwidths and measure the increase in purity and corresponding reduction in heralding efficiency . </S>"
