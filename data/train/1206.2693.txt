    "many separate pieces of evidence exist pointing towards the existence of approximately 7 times as much dark matter as baryonic matter in the universe , for example , galactic rotation curves @xcite , clusters of galaxies @xcite , lensing studies @xcite and the growth of structure @xcite .    at the time of writing",
    "though , we still do not know what the precise particle nature of the dark matter is . a class of leading candidates for dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which are charged under the standard model weak force .",
    "these models are favoured because they lead to a thermal relic abundance roughly compatible with the observed density of dark matter required to explain astrophysical observations without the requirement of fine tuning of the dark matter mass .",
    "there are three ways of looking for wimp dark matter particles , the first is to create them directly in colliders , and researchers at the lhc are working hard to do this @xcite .",
    "the second way is to look for the standard model particles created when wimp dark matter annihilates with itself in space , producing high energy gamma rays and cosmic rays , research into which is being spear - headed by the fermi gamma ray telescope .",
    "the third way is to look for the elastic collisions of dark matter particles with nuclei in purpose built underground detectors .    in order for different dark matter",
    "direct detection experiments to compare constraints with each other they have to assume a particular halo model and the one they generally use is known as the standard halo model ( shm ) .",
    "this model is one of the simplest possible solutions of the jeans equation but as we shall discuss in more detail , we do not expect the density profile or the velocity distribution of the dark matter in a real galaxy like our own to follow this and in fact there is an uncertainty in the local density and a large amount of uncertainty in the velocity distribution of dark matter .",
    "there are many different analyses which have taken this into account - large combined analysis data packages contain various assumptions which take _ some aspects _ of this uncertainty into account .",
    "those uncertainties are usually only presented in the large combined analyses taking into account all the errors on other quantities including those from particle physics and constraining particular models of particle physics such as various versions of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "they do nt necessarily present how the constraint on the cross section changes as a function of mass .",
    "we would like to estimate the error on the cross section in an independent way such that it can be understood and used by an independent researcher who comes up with a theory that makes a particular prediction for the dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "the dark matter direct detection experiment with the leading constraint on the dark matter nucleon cross section at the time of writing is the xenon-100 experiment , the constraint for dark matter particles of mass @xmath1 gev being around @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this actually places constraints on a class of susy models known as the focus point .",
    "many collider phenomenology theorists are interested in a realistic estimate of what the errors are on this result , independent of a particle theoretical framework .",
    "the experimental errors have already been quantified by the xenon team , so what remains is the uncertainty due to astrophysical unknowns .",
    "first we will make the simplifying assumption that the bulk of the dark matter halo is spherical .",
    "this neglects many aspects of the distribution of dark matter which we might expect to exist such as the oblate / prolate nature of the halo @xcite and axisymmetry @xcite , although we do nt expect these effects to change the conclusions a great deal since the constraints on the local dark matter density are mainly based on observations in the inner part of the galaxy where baryons will have increased the symmetry of the halo .",
    "we will consider the possible presence and effect of a dark disk @xcite .    unlike many previous analyses we also focus on the whole mass regime rather than concentrating on the low mass one .",
    "there is a great deal of uncertainty in the event rate in detectors at very low mass ( @xmath4 ) because the uncertainties in the velocity distributions of dark matter become most pronounced in the high velocity tails , which are the only regions of phase space which allow a low mass dark matter particle to give rise a signal in direct detection experiments .",
    "there are many papers attempting to explain the discrepancy between the dama annual modulation signal @xcite and the xenon100 constraint , so we will not attempt to add to this debate on this occasion .",
    "we are simply interested to understand what the latest constraints are really telling us in terms of numbers on the dark matter - nucleon cross section .",
    "in section [ sectiondir ] we will introduce the standard halo model and the equations for dark matter direct detection and reconstruct our version of the xenon100 constraint .",
    "after that in section [ density ] we will discuss the constraints and reconstruction of the density profile of the milky way galaxy .",
    "this section will be a poor mans reconstruction of the careful analysis of catena and ullio @xcite with some small differences but we are not only interested in the density of dark matter in the solar neighborhood , but also the density profile as a function of radius as this affects the solution of the jeans equation .",
    "section [ velocity ] will address these solutions and explain why this adds another level of uncertainty to the problem as it changes the velocity dispersion in the solar system .",
    "we will also discuss the effects of non - gaussianity of the velocity distribution .",
    "in section [ results ] we will explain our procedure for combining the various astrophysical uncertainties and present results . in section [ darkdisk ]",
    "we investigate the effect a dark disk has on the uncertainty in the signal before finally in section [ conclusions ] we will reflect upon our analysis and the results while suggesting possible future studies .",
    "such an estimate on the error associated with dark matter direct detection is almost subjective , since it involves estimating something that we can not observe directly .",
    "the particular uncertainties that any researcher will focus on might be slightly different ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this is our best attempt to estimate these uncertainties .",
    "since we expect dark matter to be moving with velocities of the order of @xmath5c in the solar system , and for their masses to be around 10 gev - 1 tev the typical recoil velocity in a direct detection experiment will be in the kev energy range .",
    "one can define a differential rate @xcite @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the recoil energy , @xmath8 is the dark matter nucleon cross section , @xmath9 is the dark matter mass , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the atomic mass number of the target nuclei which enters due to the quantum mechanical coherence effect of all the nuclei lying within the compton wavelength of the dark matter particle .",
    "@xmath12 is the nuclear form factor of the target nuclei and @xmath13 is the local density of dark matter . throughout this work",
    "we will use the helm form factor , uncertainties in nuclear form factors can also change significantly the interpretation of dark matter direct detection experiments .",
    "the function @xmath14 is the ( appropriately normalised ) dark matter velocity distribution and @xmath15 is the minimum velocity which could create a recoil of energy @xmath7 , which depends upon @xmath16 and the mass of the nucleus rather than the proton .",
    "the velocity distribution function @xmath14 is defined in the rest frame of the galaxy , relative to which we are moving at velocity @xmath17 as we circle the centre of the galaxy at a couple of hundred kilometres per second ( more discussion with regards to this precise value later ) .",
    "@xmath14 is truncated at the escape velocity @xmath18 corresponding to our position in the milky way",
    ".    the overall rate of events depends therefore not only on @xmath8 and @xmath9 as we would expect but also on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have limited information about these quantities based upon incomplete astrophysical data and incomplete theoretical knowledge in the form of both analytical and numerical solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation ( i.e. idealised solutions of the jean s equation and n - body simulations of galaxies ) .    in order to even begin to estimate the values of these parameters , we start by making some simplifying assumptions .",
    "the first is that the phase space distribution of dark matter and the gravitational potential of the galaxy are both spherically symmetric in position space .",
    "this is clearly far from a perfect assumption at small radii as we know that our galaxy is very much a disk , however we do not expect the dark matter to form a disk as readily as the baryonic component of the galaxy since it can not experience pressure or lose energy , so it is much less prone to forming viscous conglomerates which re - distribute angular momentum , like disks",
    ". we will however later look at the possibility of a dark disk .",
    "dark matter direct detection experiments need to compare their results with each other and they therefore have an agreed industry standard known as the \" standard halo model  .",
    "this model is an example of a spherically symmetric solution along with a number of further simplifying assumptions .",
    "the first is that the halo has a density profile @xmath19 which would lead to a constant rotational velocity if the gravitational potential of baryons were neglected .",
    "the second is that the velocity distribution is precisely a maxwell - boltzmann distribution and is isotropic in all directions .",
    "it can be verified that in order to solve equation ( [ jeans ] ) in the light of these assumptions , the velocity dispersion @xmath20 is a constant which does not change with radius and the standard value of @xmath21kms@xmath22 is usually chosen .",
    "this solution of the jeans equation is known as the isothermal sphere for obvious reasons .",
    "the only caprice the conservative dark matter experimentalists usually allow themselves is a variation of the escape velocity to see how sensitive their constraints are to this quantity which is not well defined for this solution .    while we do not know in detail the real distribution of dark matter in the galaxy",
    ", we do not expect the isothermal sphere to be a good approximation .",
    "n - body simulations of dark matter suggest that density profiles usually take the form of a profile which is indeed denser in the centre of the galaxy but the density rises more slowly at low radii and steeper at larger radii @xcite .",
    "we shall look at how we can model the density of dark matter in a more realistic way then we shall see what implications this has for the velocity dispersion of dark matter . having done that we will estimate how this would effect the event rate in direct detection experiments .",
    "if the dark matter is distributed smoothly in the galaxy in a similar way to that suggested by n - body simulations , the density in the solar system is remarkably well constrained to be around @xmath23 gev @xmath24 .",
    "recent studies agree with this @xcite and the most detailed study to date constrains the dark matter density very tightly @xcite .      in this work",
    "we will be assuming that the distribution of dark matter is smooth .",
    "this is not obvious as it has been shown theoretically and in simulations that there are halos within halos down to objects which are roughly the size of the solar system @xcite .",
    "it has been estimated however that these substructures will be tidally disrupted as they pass through halos the size of the milky way such that one can view the density distribution as being essentially entirely smooth to one part in ten thousand @xcite .",
    "this fits with beautiful results from n - body simulations where objects similar to caustics are clearly visible in phase space close to the virial radius of halos , but deep in the centre of dark matter halos ( where we lie ) so many streams are overlapping and so much tidal interaction has occurred that the density is essentially completely smooth @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors assume that the dark matter distribution is spherical , but take into account the non - sphericity of the baryonic disk .",
    "they look at both einasto , nfw and burkert functions for the density profiles of dark matter . in this work",
    "we will only use the einasto profile since it is the one which seems to fit n - body simulations most closely and can give rise to relatively cuspy and cored profiles .",
    "the einasto profile takes the following form @xmath25\\ ] ] and there are therefore three free parameters , the radius @xmath26 at which the logarithmic derivative of density @xmath27 is equal to @xmath28 and the density at that radius @xmath29 .",
    "the third parameter is the power @xmath30 which sets how quickly @xmath31 varies as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "we will consider two situations , the first is to allow all three parameters to vary independently in order to fit the data .",
    "the second situation is when we will constrain the relationship between the parameters using data from cosmological simulations .",
    "this latter situation takes into account the fact that one expects smaller halos which form earlier in the history of the universe to retain some memory of the density of the universe when they dropped away from the hubble expansion and collapsed .",
    "smaller halos therefore are expected to possess denser , more compact cores and the concentration parameter , namely the ratio between the virial radius of each halo @xmath33 and the scale radius ( @xmath26 in the case of the einasto profile ) is a function of mass @xcite . in particular we will follow the work of duffy et al @xcite where they parametrise the concentration parameter @xmath34 in the following way @xmath35 where @xmath36 is redshift which we will set to zero and the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are taken from reference @xcite .",
    "we will look at both situations where the parameters of the einasto profile are set to fulfill equation ( [ duffy ] ) and when they are not .",
    "the relationship in equation ( [ duffy ] ) is anyway only meant to indicate the central value of the concentration parameter as a function of mass for a large ensemble of halos .",
    "the shape of individual halos will depend upon their history .",
    "the role of baryons in affecting the distribution of dark matter in halos is as controversial as ever . for a long time",
    "it has been known that adiabatic contraction of the dark matter halo occurs when baryons lose energy and sink into the centre of the galaxy , pulling in dark matter after them @xcite .",
    "the importance of considering the shape of dark matter orbits was first pointed out in @xcite and tested to be a much better approximation than using circular orbits in work such as @xcite .",
    "this effect enhances the density of dark matter in the central region of the galaxy and makes the logarithmic density gradient @xmath31 steeper throughout the region of the galaxy where baryons dominate the gravitational potential .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the non - adiabatic feedback which follows such contraction can eject dark mater from this central region and actually decrease the central density @xcite .",
    "while we expect this to be very important for indirect detection for the annihilation of dark matter at the centre of the galaxy , it will have a lesser effect upon the dark matter at the solar radius where such effects should be less pronounced - for milky way size halos the authors of @xcite found that dark matter is ejected to form a core of size @xmath39kpc , much smaller than the 8.5 kpc radius of the sun .",
    "the precise shape of the mass profile in the galaxy will however effect the solutions of the jeans equations that will determine the phase space distribution and direct detection signal in the solar system .",
    "it is rather difficult to include adiabatic contraction in one of the monte carlo markov chains since they take significantly more time than any of the other algorithms involved in each step of the chain .",
    "for this reason we note that we are not critically sensitive to the central density of dark matter in the milky way since baryons dominate the potential at small radii and point out that the einasto profile contains the freedom to model quite different shaped halos .      in order to fit the baryonic and dark matter contributions to the gravitational potential",
    ", we again follow quite closely the analysis of @xcite with some simplifications .",
    "we model the baryonic disk of the galaxy as an exponential disk such that the surface density @xmath40 with a cut - off at 15kpc following observations while we treat the galactic bulge as a point mass at the origin .",
    "we then fit the terminal velocities in the disk @xcite which involves taking into account the non - sphericity of the baryonic distribution .",
    "we fit the solar radius @xmath41 and the value of @xmath42 and the total mass within 1.1kpc @xmath43 .",
    "we then fit the total mass within 50kpc and the total mass within 100kpc @xcite as well as the sdss data of reference @xcite , where like @xcite we allow the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath44 of the stellar population in that study to vary .",
    "we also use the same data as ullio and catena to fit the local disk density in baryonic matter and in total @xcite .",
    "the results of the fit can be seen in figure [ compare1 ] and show reasonable agreement with other estimates in the literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "any differences might be explained by the fact that we do nt use precisely the same data set as ullio and catena ( we do not include the proper motions ) and that our definition of the disk size is slightly different .",
    "these results should not be taken too seriously on their own - the purpose of this paper is not to present a definitive estimate of the local dark matter density , but rather to estimate the magnitude of typical uncertainties in the direct detection signal .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we found that as expected the spread in the constraint on the cross section obtained for different dark matter masses varies quite a lot for different velocity and density distributions , but not a huge amount . although the change can be larger than 100% the constraint on the cross section does not appear to vary more than a factor of a few at high masses .",
    "this is quite surprising given the large amount that the velocity distribution changes , but for high mass wimps , the whole of the distribution is inside the region which can give rise to a signal , so the dependence on the velocity phase space is reduced .",
    "the profiles where the density is constrained to respect the concentration parameter according to equation @xcite have less of a spread in density than the density profiles which are completely free to vary . because of this , the difference between the right hand side of the plots in figure [ spherical ] and the standard halo model plots in figure [ xenonplots ] are a good measure of the impact of allowing the velocity distributions freedom to vary upon the rate at direct detection experiments .",
    "a significant contribution to the direct detection signal could be due to the presence of a dark disk - an enhancement in the density of dark matter which is aligned with the baryonic disk and either co - rotating or lagging behind @xcite .",
    "we have tested this by doing the same fits to the density which we described in section [ density ] but including an additional disk of dark matter with a thickness of 1.1kpc in order to estimate its effect upon the direct detection rate .",
    "clearly given the discrepancy between the overall surface density of the disk @xcite and what can be seen in stars @xcite there is some room for such a disk , although figure [ ddfrac ] shows that it can not be extremely significant relative to the local dark matter in the smooth spherical halo , we find it to be typically possible to find a disk some significant fraction of the local dark matter density , but always less than the local dark matter density .    _ , width=302",
    "]    the velocity distribution of this disk is also unknown , although it is clear that its velocity distribution will be less than the velocity distribution of the halo dark matter in order for it to remain bound to the disk @xcite .",
    "we model the velocity distribution as being isotropic in the rest frame of the dark disk and of magnitude @xmath45 km s@xmath46 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the lag behind the motion of the solar system we vary between zero and 150 km s@xmath22 , both parameters chosen from a flat distribution .",
    "we then calculate the event rate inside the detector for this case of a dark disk .     while the velocities are varied as outlined in the text .",
    "even with a dark disk , the uncertainty in the constraint from direct detection experiments is still less than an order of magnitude for high mass dark matter candidates [ ddspread]_,width=377 ]    the effect of this inclusion of a dark disk is shown in figure [ ddspread ] which clearly shows that the effect of the dark disk is more pronounced at high masses , as shown in reference @xcite .",
    "this is easy to understand as the velocity of the disk dark matter relative to the solar system will be much less than those velocities which can exist in the main body of the halo .",
    "still we do not find that the allowable density of dark disk is enough to radically change the results from dark matter direct detection experiments .",
    "we therefore estimate the results presented by the xenon100 team are probably right to an accuracy within less than an order of magnitude .",
    "there are many different collaborations currently designing , building and running dark matter direct detection experiments .",
    "unlike the energy and spatial distribution of , for example , neutrinos from the sun , dark matter is very far from being in thermal equilibrium , is non relativistic and owes its motion to the feeble gravitational force of all the matter in the local universe as it makes its journey across the galaxy .",
    "following others , in this work we have tried to estimate the density of dark matter in the galaxy and then used that density to make estimates of the possible kinds of velocities dark matter could have in the solar system .",
    "we have shown that the inclusion of uncertainties in density and velocity distributions both create an effect upon the rate of events in direct detection experiments and that these uncertainties are largest at lower velocities .",
    "the purpose of this work is not to focus on the low mass regions but to investigate the errors due to astrophysical uncertainties upon searches for high mass dark matter particles .",
    "we find that for a smooth spherical halo , taking into account all the possible uncertainties in the density distribution and the jeans equation one can only increase the uncertainty in the bounds from direct detection experiments by a factor of a few . in order to try and maximise the uncertainty",
    ", we have included the presence of a dark disk but have seen that given a very pronounced dark disk is incompatible with tracers of the local density of the galaxy , this again can only increase the uncertainty by another factor of a few , leading to an overall uncertainty which is still less than an order of magnitude .",
    "we believe that these estimates are pretty robust and that the only way they could be very wrong is if the current understanding of the smoothness of the local distribution of dark matter is wildly incorrect .",
    "we havent included uncertainties in nuclear form factors which would be an additional source of error but our conclusion is that the astrophysical uncertainty in the direct detection rate for high mass candidates is less than an order of magnitude .",
