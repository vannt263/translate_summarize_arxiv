    "energy localization due to a nonlinearity in dynamical systems has been observed for more than one century @xcite , and the effect of an exact balance between nonlinearity and linear dispersion of wave packets leading to the appearance of soliton excitations has become a paradigmatic example in nonlinear science which can be found in various textbooks . in the past decade",
    "remarkable achievements in the study of localized nonlinear excitations were made with the discovery of stable localized modes in spatially discrete translationally invariant hamiltonian systems - _ discrete breathers _ ( dbs ) @xcite .",
    "they have been proved to be generic _ exact _ time - periodic solutions of the corresponding coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations , eventhough the latter are generally non - integrable .",
    "it is worth mentioning that discrete breathers have been observed experimentally in various physical systems including coupled optical waveguide arrays @xcite , coupled josephson junctions @xcite , micromechanical cantilever systems @xcite , anti - ferromagnetic crystals @xcite , high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "discrete breathers are predicted also to exist in the dynamics of dusty plasma crystals @xcite .    among the most important characteristics of a localized excitation are its localization length and the spatial decay characteristics of its amplitude .",
    "although dbs can be localized practically on a single site , in most of the cases they have exponentially decaying tails ( similar to their continuum counterparts - solitons ) .",
    "this is true if the interaction potentials are reasonably short ranged ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , when an anharmonic interaction between adjacent sites is much stronger then the harmonic one , localized excitations can become even more compact .",
    "as it was demonstrated by rosenau and hyman @xcite , in continuous systems nonlinear localized excitations may compactify , i.e. gain strictly zero tails , under nonlinear dispersion .",
    "the same was conjectured for discrete systems @xcite , however later it was shown that in discrete systems localized excitations can not have an exact compact structure @xcite , but the tail decay follows a _ super - exponentional _",
    "law @xmath1 , provided that the interaction is purely short - range .",
    "this fact was then confirmed numerically @xcite , and the corresponding breather solutions were coined _ compact - like _ @xcite or _ almost - compact _ @xcite dbs .",
    "if compact - like breathers are dynamically stable , we may expect that localized perturbations of such solutions will lead to a quasiperiodic in time evolution , which will not induce a radiation of energy away from the breather .",
    "this is in contrast to the well - known existence of such a radiation for systems with linear dispersion @xcite .",
    "there it appears due to the resonant overlap of combination frequencies of the internal perturbed breather dynamics with the spectrum of small amplitude plane waves . in the case of purely nonlinear dispersion",
    "the width of this spectrum is zero , and thus the origin of the radiation is removed .",
    "one expects then that perturbed compact - like breathers will not radiate energy away , giving rise to genuine _",
    "quasiperiodic _ compact - like breathers .",
    "another important issue which might drastically change the rate of spatial decay in dbs tails is the presence of long - range interactions , essential e.g. in systems with weakly screened coulomb interaction such as ionic crystals , or various biomolecules . usually decaying slower than exponentially in space , long - range interactions introduce a crossover length as a result of competition of the two essentially different length scales @xcite .",
    "they can also lead to the appearance of energy thresholds for dbs in some cases , where a pure short - range interaction would not be capable of producing any .",
    "in @xcite it was demonstrated , that the effect of length - scale competition with long - range algebraically and exponentially decaying interaction can lead to a new type of multistability of dbs , when in a certain model parameter regime several different types of dbs coexist having the same value of the spectral parameter ( i.e. velocity or frequency ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to address the abovelisted issues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] we introduce the model .",
    "we demonstrate , that the specifically chosen nonlinear potentials allow one to completely separate temporal and spatial dependencies and thus significantly simplify the analysis of the problem .",
    "we derive the nonlinear coupled algebraic equations for the spatial profile of a solution and in addition an ordinary differential equation ( duffing equation ) for the master function describing uniform oscillations of all the sites with time . in section  [ sec : three ] we obtain the different types of discrete breather solutions .",
    "we demonstrate , that in general the model supports two classes of discrete breathers with completely different dynamical properties .",
    "we then study the linear stability properties of basic types of dbs and observe quasiperiodic localized excitations . in section  [ sec : four ] we reveal the effect of long - range interactions along the chain on properties of db solutions .",
    "we show that the presence of non - local dispersive terms result in the appearance of several characteristic cross - over lengths .",
    "we derive estimations for these cross - over lengths , as well as asymptotes for amplitude distribution in db tails , on the basis of a simple three - site model . in section  [ sec : concl ] we conclude .",
    "we consider a simple one - dimensional model of ( nonlinearly ) coupled oscillators with the following hamiltonian : @xmath2\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the displacement of @xmath4th unit mass oscillator from its equilibrium position , the constant @xmath5 characterizes the rate of spatial decay of long - range interactions between oscillators , and @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 the equation of motion for the displacement of the @xmath4th oscillator from its equilibrium reads : @xmath8 we note that while the interaction decays algebraically for any finite power @xmath9 , in the limit @xmath10 we recover the case of short - range nearest neighbor interaction .",

    "it is important to note , that the dynamics of a db , as well as its spatial profile , depend on the sign of @xmath16 in eqs .",
    "( [ ode],[algebra ] ) .",
    "this sign is fixed only for the case of uncoupled oscillators ( @xmath20 ) and for small values of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , while generally it can be arbitrary . as a consequence , for large enough values of @xmath21 eqs .",

    "( [ mot ] ) appear , it is instructive to start with a simple case of three coupled oscillators .",
    "this simple model gives a rather good approximation for the sites of a db core , which are practically not affected by the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "here we restrict ourselves in considering only symmetric dbs centered at site @xmath23 ( it is straightforward to modify this approximate model for more complicated types of _ multi - site _",

    "( [ algebra ] ) for a larger system size ( @xmath38 ) indicates essential discrepancies when @xmath39 ( see triangles in the inset in fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "it comes from the fact that a db core of breathers with the non - staggered profile extends while increasing @xmath21 , approaching continuum compacton solutions @xcite as @xmath33 . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profs](a ) , while a db core involves more and more sites with increasing @xmath21 , its characteristic width in terms of the continuum coordinate @xmath40 remains to be fixed and demonstrates rather good agreement with the value @xmath41 reported for dbs in the continuum limit @xcite .",

    "however , long - range interactions destroy the uniform staggered pattern , introducing a complicated domain - like structure in the breather tails , as will be explained below .    unlike dbs with non - staggered profile , the staggered core dbs stay localized on a few sites as @xmath21 increases , therefore the 3-site model gives a rather good approximation for larger size systems for arbitrarily large values of @xmath21 ( see squares in the inset in fig .",

    "simultaneously , the amplitude of these dbs decreases as @xmath33 ( for a fixed value of the frequency ) .",

    "thus , for large @xmath4 one can derive from ( [ algebra ] ) the following asymptote : @xmath98,\\ ] ] which in fact gives a rather good approximation for all tail sites starting from the first cross - over point @xmath99 ( see solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 g ] ) .",
    "note that only amplitudes of the two db core sites and the sign of separation constant @xmath16 are needed to obtain this asymptote for tail amplitude distribution . in this respect",
    "we found the simple three - site model , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , to be very fruitful : it gives full information not only about the db core sites , but about tail characteristics as well .",
    "note that the specific structure of a staggered db core with a central site @xmath23 and two neighboring sites @xmath43 having amplitudes @xmath12 of opposite signs stipulates several other cross - over lengths connected to changes of the sign of the r.h.s . in ( [ powerlaw ] ) which manifest as singularities in the logarithmic plots in fig.[fig2 g ] .",
    "the most pronounced cross - over at @xmath100 is associated with the change from a single power law @xmath101 to a more complex one ( [ powerlaw ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 g ] . indeed , in the case @xmath102 the expression ( [ powerlaw ] ) can be re - written as : @xmath103 ( @xmath104 for a staggered core db and @xmath105 for a non - staggered db ) .",
    "thus , in leading order , at large enough distance from the db center @xmath106 the tail amplitudes follow the same power law @xmath101 as the decay of long - range interactions . since @xmath96 is defined by the vanishing of the bracket on the right hand side of eq .",

    "@xmath115 the tail amplitudes decay following a more complicated power law ( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "to conclude , we revealed the influence of long - range nonlinear interactions on the spatial profile and properties of compact - like discrete breathers in a model of coupled oscillators with pure nonlinear dispersion . as we demonstrate , it is the intriguing property of the model under consideration , that it supports two classes of discrete breathers  with _ staggered _ and _ non - staggered _ spatial profiles of a db core  having different dynamical properties .",
    "the dynamics of a non - staggered db is essentially governed by the _ soft _ nonlinear on - site potential , while dbs with the staggered core have the opposite , _ hard _ , type of nonlinear dynamical behavior caused mainly by the presence of nonlinear interactions in the chain .",
    "apart from different dynamical properties , the influence of long - range interactions on spatial profiles of these two types of dbs is also different . with the algebraic spatial decay long - range interactions",
    "introduce a new length scale which becomes essential at large enough distances from a db core .",
    "we show , that the effect of long- and short - range terms competition results in the appearance of a characteristic cross - over length @xmath86 in both types of dbs , at which the spatial tail decay drastically changes from the super - exponential law to the algebraic one . for large powers @xmath9 of the long - range interactions spatial decay the cross - over length @xmath86 scales logarithmically with @xmath9 .",
    "the tail asymptote ( [ powerlaw ] ) demonstrates complex power law spatial decay , which follows essentially the same algebraic decay as the long - range interactions in the system at large enough distances from the db core . while for non - staggered dbs",
    "the influence of long - range interactions manifests through the only characteristic cross - over length @xmath86 , the spatial profile of dbs with the staggered core possess several other cross - over lengths associated with sign changes of the asymptote ( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "thus , the spatial pattern of oscillations in a db with the staggered core becomes rather complicated in the presence of long - range interactions : its core sites perform anti - phase oscillations , while its tails are splitted in several domains of in - phase oscillations .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the discussed case of purely nonlinear coupled oscillators represents a simple model to reveal properties of nonlinear excitations in a system without linear phonons . as we demonstrated in this paper , ``",
    "switching off '' the phonons leads not only to the change in characteristic rate of spatial localization of energy , but to appearance of several other intriguing _ dynamical _ properties of nonlinear localized excitations .",
    "especially it eliminates the possible source of linear resonances which otherwise would destroy quasiperiodic breathers and possibly also moving breathers .",
    "the discussed models thus allow to obtain a better understanding of the general problem of existence / non - existence of quasi - periodic and moving discrete breather solutions .",
