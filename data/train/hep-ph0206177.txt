    "one interface between particle physics and cosmology is the attempt to provide an explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "leptogenesis represents one of the most attractive possibilities for the generation of this asymmetry .",
    "the recent discovery of neutrino masses has further increased the credibility of this scenario . in its original incarnation @xcite",
    ", leptogenesis relies upon the decay of right - handed majorana neutrinos to create lepton number , which is subsequently transformed into baryon number by the electroweak @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "this traditional scenario relies in an essential way on the breaking of lepton number by the majorana right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the attractive feature of this model is that the right - handed neutrinos responsible for the generation of the lepton asymmetry are also responsible for the smallness of the observed neutrino masses through the see - saw @xcite mechanism .",
    "since the original model of ( majorana ) leptogenesis , there have been two important observations .",
    "first , the provoking observation has been made that it is not necessary to break lepton number to have a theory of leptogenesis , and that leptogenesis could be accomplished in a theory with dirac neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we will review this idea in the next section .",
    "a disadvantage of this idea , relative to the traditional models of leptogenesis , is that it possesses no relationship between the mechanisms responsible for the generation of the lepton asymmetry and the smallness of the neutrino masses .",
    "the second observation was that , in supersymmetric theories , it is possible to explain the smallness of the neutrino yukawa couplings by relating their presence to supersymmetry breaking @xcite . combining these two ideas allows us to once again relate the generation of the lepton asymmetry to the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "this brings dirac leptogenesis on to a footing equal to that of the traditional majorana leptogenesis models .",
    "the only ingredient that this mechanism requires beyond the usual leptogenesis scenario is a @xmath1 symmetry , which forbids the bare yukawa couplings between the left and right - handed neutrinos .",
    "reference @xcite noted that , even in a theory that conserves lepton number , a cp violating decay of a heavy particle can result in a non - zero lepton number for left - handed particles , and an equal and opposite non - zero lepton number for right - handed particles . for most standard model species ,",
    "yukawa interactions between the left - handed and right - handed particles are sufficiently strong to cancel these two stores of lepton number rapidly .",
    "however , the interactions of a right - handed dirac neutrino are exceedingly weak , and equilibrium between left - handed lepton number and right - handed lepton number will not be reached until temperatures fall well below the weak scale . by this time lepton number",
    "has already been converted to baryon number by sphalerons .    to see how this scenario works , imagine that a negative lepton number is stored in the left - handed neutrinos , while a positive lepton number of equal magnitude is stored in the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "sphalerons act only on left - handed particles , violating @xmath0 while conserving @xmath2 .",
    "this means part of the negative lepton number stored in left - handed neutrinos can be converted to a positive baryon number by the electroweak anomaly .",
    "the ( now smaller in magnitude ) negative lepton number stored in the left - handed neutrinos ultimately equilibrates with the positive lepton number stored in the right - handed neutrinos only after the temperature of universe drops below electronvolts .",
    "the processes responsible for equilibrating the right and left - handed neutrinos conserve both @xmath3 and @xmath4 separately .",
    "the ultimate result is a universe with a total positive lepton number and a total positive baryon number .",
    "the basic program in this letter is to generate small dirac yukawa couplings by integrating out a heavy field following the methods of @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the yukawa couplings will be explained by the large ratio between the scale of supersymmetry breaking and the heavy masses .",
    "the key point is that the same heavy fields can be responsible for the generation of the cp asymmetry .",
    "the heavy fields to be integrated out are three pairs of vector - like leptons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , one pair per generation of standard model particles .",
    "these fields transform as doublets under @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 multiplets to preserve the success of gauge coupling unification .",
    "the matter content is that of @xmath9 in @xmath10 if supplemented by additional singlets . ]",
    "the decay of these heavy leptons will also provide the necessary cp violation for leptogenesis . in order to have cp violation in this sector",
    ", it is sufficient to have two generations .",
    "we work in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) augmented by three generations of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we forbid bare yukawa couplings , @xmath11 , through the use of a @xmath1 symmetry , as a global symmetry . in case of worries concerning violation of global symmetries by quantum gravity effects ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , we note that there is no obstacle to gauging this symmetry .",
    "all that is required is to introduce appropriate matter to keep the @xmath12 symmetry anomaly - free .",
    "] under which the @xmath13 has charge @xmath14 , while all the fields of the mssm are uncharged .",
    "we also add a gauge singlet , @xmath15 that breaks @xmath1 when it acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the field content of the model , along with the charges under @xmath7 , @xmath16 , @xmath1 , and @xmath17 is shown in table  1 .",
    "@xmath16 is the standard lepton number , which remains a symmetry in this model broken only by the @xmath18 anomaly .",
    ".the field content and quantum numbers of the model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with these charge assignments , the most general renormalizable superpotential is : @xmath19 where we have suppressed generation indices . upon integrating out the heavy vector lepton pair",
    ", we get the following superpotential : @xmath20 next , we arrange for the @xmath15 field to take on a weak - scale vev .",
    "we can accomplish this , for example , through the use of an oraifeartaigh model of the type used for neutrino masses in @xcite .",
    "this approach gives @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the limit of global supersymmetry , but @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a dimensionless coupling constant , after supergravity effects are taken into account . because of the large @xmath25 , left - handed and right - handed sneutrinos equilibrate quickly above the weak scale",
    "however , the asymmetry stored in the right - handed neutrino ( fermion ) remains intact .",
    "interesting collider phenomenology could result from the large @xmath26 @xcite . in any case",
    ", it is clear that the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath27 , will be suppressed by the ratio of the weak scale to the heavy masses : @xmath28 because @xmath29 does not have to be exactly at the electroweak scale , it gives an additional freedom beyond the traditional majorana leptogenesis .",
    "we note that a very similar superpotential was considered in @xcite , with the vev of the @xmath15 field replaced with a hard mass .",
    "it remains to check whether this scenario can generate a sufficient baryon asymmetry .",
    "cp violation will enter the theory through the decay of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles .",
    "there are equal contributions from the decay of the scalar and fermionic components . for simplicity",
    ", we will concentrate on the decay of the scalars .",
    "the leading order contribution to the cp violation in @xmath5 decay comes from the interference between the tree - level diagrams and the absorbative part of the one - loop wave function renormalization diagrams @xcite . in the case where there are two `` generations '' of @xmath30 pairs , it is possible to rotate away all but one physical phase .",
    "we will consider this case in the following .",
    "additional generations of the @xmath30 pairs will just allow for the possibility of additional baryon number generation .",
    "in addition , the two generation case is a good approximation if the masses of the @xmath5 particles are reasonably well - separated .",
    "we take the mass matrix , @xmath31 , to be diagonal with elements @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the diagrams relevant to the calculation of the cp asymmetry are shown in in figure 1 . restoring the generation indices to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : superpotential ] ) , we have : @xmath34     and @xmath6 scalar decays .",
    "the absorbative part of the one - loop diagrams contributes to the cp asymmetry . ]",
    "now we proceed with the calculation of the asymmetry . in the case where the magnitudes of the masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 are well separated",
    ", the asymmetry will be dominated by the decay of the lightest @xmath30 pair ( we take @xmath37 ) and can readily be calculated ( following the methods of @xcite ) .",
    "we now define the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in @xmath40 ,",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 indices run over the generations of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 particles .",
    "for the decay asymmetries , we find : @xmath43 note that @xmath44 due to supersymmetry , because chiral superfields @xmath5 and @xmath6 form a massive super - multiplet . here",
    "we have used the same names for fermion and scalar fields in the same multiplet , and the @xmath41 and @xmath42 indices labeling the generation of the final state particles are summed over .",
    "the above asymmetries in the decay amplitude give rise to a store of lepton number in the left - handed and right - handed ( s)neutrinos . in the limit that the particles decay well out - of equilibrium ( the `` drift and decay '' limit ) ,",
    "the asymmetry is given by @xcite : @xmath45 however , this limit is not necessarily applicable , as the condition for out - of - equilibrium decay , @xmath46 , is only marginally satisfied .",
    "therefore , one should solve the full system of boltzmann equations numerically , including @xmath47 scattering , to accurately determine the lepton asymmetry .",
    "however , for an existence proof that this mechanism will work , we will not need to resort to these numerics : we simply note that for the specific choices of @xmath48 and @xmath29 equal to the electroweak vev , our asymmetry ( and neutrino mass matrices ) will reduce to that of the standard supersymmetric leptogenesis scenario with majorana neutrinos .",
    "it has been shown ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) , that the generation of a sufficient lepton asymmetry is possible in this case , with the mass of heavy neutrinos at the @xmath49 gev scale . indeed",
    ", it is possible that more complicated textures for @xmath50 and @xmath51 might lead to a more efficient generation of a lepton asymmetry while remaining consistent with low - energy data on neutrino oscillations .",
    "theories of supersymmetric leptogenesis have tension with the gravitino problem ; the reheat temperature must be low enough to avoid cosmological difficulties associated with gravitino production .",
    "a typical constraint is @xmath52@xmath49  gev for 12  tev gravitino @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the reheat temperature must be high enough to produce the particles ( in our case the @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) that need to be heavy in order to decay out of equilibrium .",
    "however , as we have shown above , our scenario can reproduce a baryon asymmetry equal to that of the traditional leptogenesis scenario , which has been shown to be compatible with gravitino constraints @xcite .",
    "there are a host of other ideas to help with this tension .",
    "for example , theories of anomaly mediation @xcite , have gravitino masses that are heavier than the usual case by a loop factor , of order 100 tev .",
    "furthermore , there has been recent work suggesting that it may be possible to significantly increase the mass of the gravitino in theories with weak scale supersymmetry , thereby obviating the gravitino problem @xcite .",
    "yet another possibility involves using coherent oscillations of the scalar fields carrying lepton number @xcite . in our case",
    "the @xmath53 flat direction could be used , for example , with the oraifeartaigh model discussed earlier with @xmath54 , @xmath55  tev .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath13 and @xmath4 remain pinned to the origin .",
    "if we stick to the simplifying ansatz @xmath56 , we can scale @xmath57 proportional to @xmath29 so as to reproduce the observed neutrino masses with the same yukawa couplings as the traditional case .",
    "this means that the cp asymmetry remains the same as well .",
    "working within the model of @xcite ( replacing @xmath13 with the @xmath53 flat direction ) , in order to have the cp asymmetry large enough , we require @xmath58  gev",
    ". this can well be consistent with the gravitino mass of @xmath59  tev .",
    "in addition , the possibility @xmath60 gives even more freedom .",
    "it would be interesting to study the gravitino problem with both @xmath29 and @xmath25 ( and hence the gravitino mass ) as free parameters , such as in models of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "smaller @xmath25 gives a lighter gravitino , and the constraint on the reheat temperature is more severe @xcite .",
    "however , smaller @xmath25 allows smaller @xmath29 while preventing the appearance of a negative eigenvalue in the sneutrino mass - squared matrix .",
    "this , in turn , would allow for lighter @xmath5 , which helps with the gravitino problem .",
    "therefore , we expect dirac leptogenesis to accommodate models with lower @xmath25 more easily than traditional leptogenesis models .",
    "there might be a worry that the right - handed neutrinos could potentially represent a dangerous number of additional light species at the time of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the constraint is @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "however , by the time of bbn , the contribution of right - handed neutrinos is suppressed by the entropy factor : @xmath62^{4/3 } = 0.02 $ ] and is safe .",
    "when the @xmath12 symmetry is broken by the @xmath15 vev or @xmath63 vev , a nambu - goldstone boson will be produced .",
    "generally , stringent astrophysical constraints on such particles ( e.g.  majorons , familons ) are derived from looking at supernovae .",
    "the usual constraints assume couplings between the sm fields and the nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "in contrast , in this case the right handed neutrino is the only light field charged under the @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the couplings of the nambu - goldstone bosons to the matter in the supernova will be exceedingly weak .",
    "nambu - goldstone boson production processes will be suppressed by factors of @xmath64 relative to the usual case . since even the usual case ( see , for example , @xcite ) , can be made acceptable , there is clearly no problem here .",
    "we have presented a realistic model of supersymmetric leptogenesis using dirac neutrinos .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino yukawa couplings is related to the presence of heavy fields whose decay provides the seed for the baryon number of our universe . the only ingredient used in this scenario above and beyond the usual leptogenesis scenario is the imposition of a @xmath1 symmetry",
    ". it would be interesting to search for a fundamental origin for this symmetry . because of the simplicity of this model , we believe that leptogenesis with dirac neutrinos should be placed on an equal footing with the usual majorana leptogenesis scenarios .",
    "this model clearly displays that neutrinos need not be majorana in order for them to play a major role in the generation of the baryon asymmetry . in this scenario , leptogenesis will not give rise to any signal in neutrino - less double beta decay experiments .",
