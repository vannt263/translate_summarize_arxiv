    "the morphology and dynamics of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) depend on the geometry of the explosions as well as the distribution of the circumstellar medium ( csm ; see review by @xcite ) .",
    "snrs from massive progenitors are luminous from the interaction of the ejecta with nearby gas that was expelled by the progenitor system @xcite , probably during a red supergiant stage . beyond the relic red giant wind material ,",
    "the csm is likely to have been highly disturbed by previous evolutionary stages @xcite as well as by density discontinuities or gradients in the interstellar medium ( ism ; @xcite ) , such as molecular cloud edges .",
    "consequently , the relative role of the explosion and the environment in shaping snrs remains an outstanding question , and it has even been cited as the biggest challenge in modern snr research @xcite .    the difficult task of unraveling the origin of asymmetries in snrs is best illustrated by w49b ( g43.3@xmath10.2 ) , the most luminous snr in our galaxy in x - rays ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ; @xcite ) and in @xmath4-rays @xcite .",
    "x - ray imaging of w49b has shown an unusual morphology , with a highly elliptical shape comprised of an iron - rich bar with two plumes at its edges @xcite .",
    "the integrated x - ray spectrum exhibits strong emission lines from several metals ( e.g. , si , s , ar , ca , and fe : @xcite ) with supersolar abundances , indicating an ejecta origin .",
    "these metals appear segregated , with the fe absent in the east , while the silicon and other intermediate - mass elements are distributed more homogeneously @xcite .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous morphology of w49b : a bipolar / jet - driven core - collapse ( cc ) sn @xcite or a spherically symmetric sn that expanded into an inhomogeneous ism @xcite .",
    "observational evidence shows that w49b has a complex environment : near - infrared imaging revealed bright [ fe ii ] rings thought to be wind material from a massive star progenitor @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath5co and warm , shocked h@xmath6 gas have been detected surrounding the snr @xcite .",
    "however , the abundance ratios of the ejecta from across w49b are similar to the predictions for a jet - driven explosion of a 25 @xmath0 wolf - rayet ( wr ) progenitor @xcite and are inconsistent with values expected in symmetric cc sne @xcite .",
    "moreover , the distinct morphology of fe is likely due to anisotropic ejection of heavy metals , since fe xxv line emission is missing from the eastern part of the snr , even though the temperatures there are sufficient to produce that line emission .",
    "these observations show that the x - ray line emission morphology of young snrs like w49b can be altered not only by the structure of the ejecta but also by the spatial distribution of the elements synthesized within the sn explosion .",
    "numerical models of jet - driven sn explosions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the greater kinetic energy at the poles of the exploding star can lead to efficient synthesis of nickel there , while lower-@xmath7 elements are ejected more isotropically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the issue of how this bipolar morphology is modified by the expansion into the external medium @xcite and its implications for w49b remains an unresolved problem .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we aim to determine the degree to which the dynamics and abundance structures of a jet - driven snr are modified by the interaction with the external medium . as the csm of a massive star",
    "is modified by their winds , we consider shocked wind bubbles for the surrounding media .",
    "given that a complete simulation of a jet - driven snr s evolution is computationally expensive , we perform two separate hydrodynamical calculations , each equipped to describe the behavior of the bipolar outflow at two different epochs . in section  [ sec : num ] , we present a brief description of the numerical methods . in section  [ sec : jet ] , we use a simulation with a general equation of state and a reaction network to determine the nucleosynthesis that accompanies a jet propagating through the massive star . in section",
    "[ sec : snr ] , we employ the resulting models ( i.e. , the density , velocity , and compositional structure of the ejecta ) as the initial conditions in the calculation of the subsequent hydrodynamical expansion of the snr and the associated thermal x - ray emission produced by the hot shocked gas",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : dis ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the dynamics and explosive nucleosynthesis of a jet - driven sn , we have performed a set of two - dimensional cylindrically symmetric simulations .",
    "we use the adaptive mesh refinement code _ mezcal _ @xcite , which incorporates a nuclear network module and different equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "the _ helmholtz _",
    "eos @xcite , which includes radiation , ion pressure , and electron - positron degeneracy pressures , is used in section  [ sec : jet ] when calculating the propagation of the jet through the star , while a simple ideal gas eos is used in section  [ sec : snr ] when computing the long - term evolution of the snr .",
    "the nucleosynthesis is calculated by coupling the hydrodynamics equations to an inexpensive , seven element _",
    "@xmath8-chain _ nuclear network @xcite , comprising the evolution of the @xmath9he , @xmath10c , @xmath11o , @xmath12ne , @xmath13 mg , @xmath14si , @xmath15ni mass densities and energy losses due to neutrino cooling . in the nuclear network ,",
    "the @xmath14si and @xmath15ni mass fractions are representative of the silicon and iron mass fraction groups , respectively . a detailed description of the implementation of the nuclear burning module in the _ mezcal _ code is presented in @xcite .",
    "seconds after the bipolar ejecta has broken free from the @xmath16 stellar progenitor . the pressure @xmath17 , mass density @xmath18 and the silicon @xmath19(si ) and nickel @xmath19(ni ) mass fractions are indicated in each frame with corresponding size scales in units of @xmath20 .",
    "the jet propagation inside the wr progenitor is calculated using an adaptive cylindrical grid of physical size @xmath21  cm , with @xmath22 cells on the coarsest grid and 7 levels of refinement , which corresponds to a maximum resolution of @xmath23  cm . ]",
    "massive star for the case of an ism pressure typical of the high - density molecular region surrounding w49b .",
    "the dense rsg shell , with a mass of about 6.5 @xmath24 , is located at 2.5  pc .",
    "the region outside the red supergiant shell is the remains of the bubble from the main - sequence phase while the density in the shocked region is approximately constant .",
    "the output of the hydrodynamic simulations at the time of homology ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) was mapped onto the grid at small spatial scales .",
    "shown is the logarithm of the mass density at an evolutionary time of 20 yr after the supernova explosion .",
    "the calculations are performed on a grid with size @xmath25  cm , with @xmath26 cells on the coarsest grid and 7 levels of refinement . ]",
    "based on the abundances derived from the x - ray spectra of w49b , @xcite showed the nucleosynthesis was consistent with a bipolar explosion of a 25 @xmath0 wolf - rayet ( wr ) star .",
    "thus , for our initial conditions , we adopt the _ e25 _ pre - supernova stellar model of @xcite . the pre - supernova star , initially a 25 @xmath0 wr star , has a mass of 5.45 @xmath27 , a radius of @xmath28  cm , and an iron core mass of 1.45 @xmath0 extending out to a radius @xmath29  cm .",
    "a uniform jet with sharp edges and opening angle of @xmath30 is injected from a boundary located at @xmath31 with a velocity @xmath32 .",
    "the jet injection time is @xmath33  s , which results in a total energy of 6@xmath34  erg .",
    "the results of the simulation of the jet - driven sn explosion are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] , where the mass density @xmath18 , pressure @xmath17 , silicon @xmath19(si ) and nickel @xmath19(ni ) mass fractions of the expanding collimated ejecta are plotted @xmath35  s after the jet has broken free from the star . in the direction of the propagation of the jet ,",
    "the resulting post - shock temperatures are high ( with @xmath36  k ) , leading to complete oxygen and silicon burning there @xcite .",
    "consequently , the expansion velocity of the newly synthesized @xmath15ni is closely aligned with the jet axis .",
    "as it expands inside the progenitor star , the jet is unable to move the stellar material at a velocity comparable to its own and hence is abruptly slowed down .",
    "a large fraction of the energy output during this phase is accumulated into a cocoon surrounding the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the lateral production of @xmath15ni is confined to the deepest stellar layers , and elements ejected in this direction by the cocoon s expansion are primarily the products of hydrostatic nuclear burning with some explosive oxygen - burning products ( e.g. , si , s ) . as a result ,",
    "the distribution of nickel is much more elongated than that of silicon @xcite , as can be clearly seen in the abundance distributions shown in figure [ fig1 ] . the jetted outflow , responsible for synthesizing @xmath15ni , is observed to carry more energy and inertia than the broader ( incomplete silicon and oxygen burning ) component , so that the latter never overtakes it .",
    "therefore , the distribution asymmetry in the abundance is expected to be preserved as the sn material sweeps up the external medium .",
    "next , we consider the interaction of the jet with the csm .",
    "the pre - supernova stellar wind depends on the evolutionary stages prior to and during the wr phase . a standard evolutionary track at solar metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is for an o star to evolve through a red supergiant ( rsg ) phase or luminous blue variable phase with considerable mass loss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and then to become a wr star . at low metallicity and for some binary stars ,",
    "the rsg phase may be absent @xcite .",
    "when the fast wr wind starts blowing , it sweeps up the rsg wind material into a dense , cold shell @xcite .",
    "the radius of the shocked region depends on the duration of the wr phase @xmath37 , the ratio of the mass - loss rates @xmath38 , and wind velocities @xmath39 .",
    "here we assume @xmath40 yr , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .    with these reference values ,",
    "the radius of the wind termination shock is @xmath43 pc and the pressure ( in units of ba/@xmath44 , where @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant ) in the shocked region is @xmath45 k @xmath46 @xcite . if the external pressure @xmath47 ( as expected in molecular clouds where @xmath48 k @xmath46 : @xcite ) , the expansion of the rsg will be stalled .",
    "the density in the shocked region is approximately constant , and beyond the contact discontinuity ( at @xmath49 : @xcite ) , a region of shocked ( dense ) cold rsg material is expected .",
    "the csm around a 25 @xmath27 massive stellar progenitor appears as in figure  [ fig2 ] . at solar metallicity ,",
    "the star has a long - lived rsg phase that dramatically affects the surrounding medium .",
    "in particular , a dense rsg shell occurs at roughly 2.5 pc , approximated here for the case of a high ism pressure typical of molecular clouds .",
    "we note that in reality , the rsg shell is subject to hydrodynamical instabilities @xcite , and its radius depends sensitively on several parameters , including @xmath37 ( which varies with mass and metallicity ) , @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath50 .    . shown in each frame",
    "are the velocity @xmath51 , mass density @xmath18 and the silicon @xmath19(si ) and nickel @xmath19(ni ) mass fractions at @xmath52 yr together with the corresponding unit size scale .",
    "the superimposed vectors in the upper left frame show the velocity field of the resulting sn remnant . ]",
    "before the snr size becomes comparable to the scale length of the rsg shell , the morphology of the remnant will reflect the geometry of the initial explosion @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the density contours in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the expansion of the bipolar remnant will be stalled when it reaches the sharp density discontinuity at @xmath532.5 pc .",
    "the interaction of the ejecta with the rsg shell results in the disruption of the dense thin layer before the jet undergoes substantial lateral expansion .",
    "consequently , the initial asymmetry of the explosion is preserved ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the rsg shell , clearly apparent in figure  [ fig2 ] , will be pushed outward at high velocities as a result of the interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] also shows the development of _ fingers _ extending from the deformed shell and produced by the rayleigh - taylor instability . despite the large density contrast",
    ", the pressure in the remnant remains fairly uniform . both the deformed thin layer and the protruding _ fingers _",
    "expand at velocities @xmath54 500  km s@xmath3 .",
    "these large velocities are produced as a result of successive shocks ramming into the deformed thin layer .",
    "the strands of material formed as the thin dense layer is disrupted could be responsible for the prominent x - ray line emission filaments observed in w49b @xcite .    the accompanying evolution of the metal distribution is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "a broadening of the iron - group filaments is clearly seen after the interaction with the rsg shell , which is accompanied by the development of small - scale density fluctuations .",
    "after @xmath55 = 260 yr and radii of @xmath56 3 pc , the iron - group ( @xmath57 ) and silicon ( @xmath58 ) structures have become highly irregular , with the iron - group elements being significantly more extended along the jet axis .",
    "the remnant also shows a complex velocity structure with fast - moving iron filaments expanding along the explosion center , which are less pronounced in the initially more centrally concentrated silicon - rich material .",
    "thus , although the structure of the csm plays a prominent role , our results demonstrate that the measurable properties of young snrs depend sensitively on the initial distribution of the metal - rich ejecta .",
    ") and silicon ( @xmath58 ) mass fractions at @xmath55= 60  yr ( @xmath59 ) , 100  yr ( @xmath60 ) , 140  yr ( @xmath61 ) , 260  yr ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the individual frames have been successively rotated by @xmath63 . a 1 pc scale bar is shown . ]",
    "200 pixels . to match the characteristics of the w49b",
    ", the results of the simulation have been rotated 45@xmath64 with respect to the plane of the sky ( in the direction of the observer ) , and 120@xmath64 with respect to the @xmath65-axis ( the initial direction of the jet ) , before the emission being integrating along the line of sight . ]",
    "the results presented here illustrate how the dynamics of young , jet - driven snrs , are influenced by the interaction of the ejecta with the csm . by comparing our hydrodynamical simulations to the observational properties of w49b",
    ", we can gain a deeper understanding on the nature of bipolar snr .",
    "a few observables are relatively easy to determine from one - dimensional hydrodynamical models , e.g. expansion rates and thickness of flow structures . however , other comparisons can be more challenging .",
    "for example , to predict the distribution of the observed thermal x - ray emission , multidimensional simulations are necessary to follow the detailed distribution and composition of ejecta , their clumping , and the inhomogeneous csm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to date",
    ", simulations to reproduce the thermal x - ray morphology of w49b have not been done due to an absence of a commonly accepted dynamical model .",
    "the observed anisotropic distribution of strong x - ray line features from si and fe in w49b strongly suggests that heavy - element - enriched material was produced asymmetrically deep within the exploded star @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here support this idea .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows that even in the presence of a uniform external medium , the thermal x - ray morphology of a jet - driven snr is dominated by a bright iron jet , rimmed by a plateau of explosive oxygen - burning products , such as silicon and sulfur .",
    "the bright x - ray luminosity of w49b may be characteristic of the interaction with the csm produced by extensive mass loss prior to the explosion ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this csm has a mass comparable to that of the supernova material and is not expected to spread out beyond a few parsecs in length because of the large surrounding pressure . only after several centuries",
    ", the supernova ejecta will break free from this relatively dense csm ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "but w49b is also interacting with a molecular cloud in the east @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the x - ray surface brightness along its circumference presented by @xcite , revealed the stalling of the expansion in the eastern region as the ejecta collides with molecular material .",
    "this interaction is likely responsible for halting the expansion of the jetted ejecta , creating the observed thermal x - ray wing feature from the lateral expansion of shocked material @xcite . as relativistic ions are accelerated through this dense molecular material by highly supersonic shocks",
    ", the resultant pion decay is likely to be responsible for producing the observed gev @xmath4-rays @xcite . in the future",
    ", three - dimensional simulations incorporating an anisotropic external medium will be necessary to test our two - dimensional results and to thoroughly investigate the effects of the molecular cloud interaction on the resulting thermal x - ray structures .",
    "based on the absence of an x - ray luminous compact object , @xcite predicted a black hole was formed during the explosion of w49b .",
    "if it originated from a jet - driven cc sn , it could have been one with a sub - relativistic collimated outflow , as opposed to the rare , high lorentz factor jets in gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "for example , it could be the common jet - driven sn discussed by @xcite , in which case the core collapse continues to form a black hole instead of halting upon producing a neutron star .",
    "even for the simplest csm distribution , we have shown that the structure resulting from the expansion of a jet - driven remnant like w49b is considerably different from that of a more standard cc sn explosion .",
    "in particular , the morphology at early stages ( after several hundred years ) still reflects the asymmetry of the explosion , even in a complex , dense csm ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) . in principle",
    "then , one could identify jet - driven snrs based on the abundance distribution and morphology , although the csm influences their overall shape somewhat , especially at late times .",
