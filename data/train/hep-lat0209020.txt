    "the need for a high - precision prediction for @xmath2 amplitudes is underlined by the recent experimental measurement of re(@xmath3 ) and the long - standing puzzle , the @xmath4 rule .",
    "although the finite - volume ( fv ) techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite can ultimately enable an accurate calculation of @xmath2 decay rates , the most practical approach to the numerical calculation of these decay rates remains the combination of lattice qcd and ( quenched and partially quenched ) @xmath1pt . apart from a calculation for the cp - conserving , @xmath5 , @xmath2 decay in ref .",
    "@xcite , all the numerical studies hitherto follow a strategy proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which only allows the determination of these amplitudes at leading - order ( lo ) in the chiral expansion .",
    "because of the large kaon mass and the presence of final state interactions , non - lo corrections in this expansion are significant . in a recent work @xcite , we have proposed to perform lattice simulations at unphysical kinematics over a range of meson masses and momenta , from which we can determine all the necessary lecs for constructing the physical matrix element @xmath6 at nlo in the chiral expansion . we have suggested a specific unphysical kinematics , the spqr kinematics as explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , which enables such a procedure , and have studied the following @xmath7 operators ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 are colour indices ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electric charge of @xmath12 and @xmath13 means @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite , we investigate the fv corrections , power - like in @xmath15 , which arise from replacing sums by integrals in the one - loop calculation that involves the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 . at two particular kinematics , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with all mesons at rest , have been performed in refs .",
    "] it can be shown that a diagram which does not have an imaginary part in minkowski space will only have fv corrections exponential in @xmath18 , therefore only diagram ( c ) contributes to the @xmath19 corrections .",
    "because the two - pion final state has @xmath20 , this diagram only contains four - quark intermediate states and there are no disconnected quark - loops in the quark - flow picture . for the same reason",
    ", it does not receive contributions from the @xmath21 propagator .",
    "hence the @xmath19 effects are identical in @xmath1pt and quenched @xmath1pt ( q@xmath1pt ) for @xmath0 at this order , and only at this order .",
    "this is not true for @xmath4 decay amplitudes @xcite .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ]    we have found that in the center - of - mass frame , for all the @xmath0 amplitudes , these one - loop @xmath19 corrections are independent of the weak operators and can be removed by a universal factor derived first by lellouch and lscher in ref",
    "this modifies the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite , in which a fv effect resulting in the shift of the two - pion total energy in the argument of the tree - level amplitudes is interpreted as a genuine @xmath19 correction to the matrix elements , and therefore the fv effects in @xmath22 are found to depend on @xmath23 .",
    "we are currently investigating the fv effects of these amplitudes in a moving frame .",
    "the lellouch - lscher factor has not yet been derived for this , while the modification of lscher s quantisation condition @xcite relating the infinite - volume @xmath24 scattering phase to the fv two - pion energy spectrum , due to the moving frame was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a by - product of our work",
    ", we verify that the energy shift obtained in one - loop perturbation theory in a moving frame agrees with the expansion of the quantization condition in ref .",
    "@xcite to the same order .",
    "we evaluate the one - loop correction by using dimensional regularisation and subtracting @xmath25 .",
    "the lowest - order amplitudes are all proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the light pseudoscalar meson decay constant in the chiral limit . at nlo",
    ", we choose to express @xmath26 in terms of @xmath28 .",
    "this factor fully absorbs the dependence upon the gasser - leutwyler lecs @xmath29 and @xmath30 introduced via wavefunction renormalisation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - loop diagrams have been calculated for arbitrary external meson four - momenta in both @xmath1pt and q@xmath1pt .",
    "the results are lengthy and are presented on a web site @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 , we show an example of these results for @xmath31 .",
    "these plots are the ratios between the one - loop corrections and the lowest - order matrix elements with both final - state pions at rest .",
    "2a is the result in @xmath1pt and fig .",
    "2b is that in q@xmath1pt .",
    "this figure suggests that in a quenched numerical calculation of these matrix elements , it is not appropriate in general to perform chiral extrapolation using unquenched @xmath1pt results @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical data @xcite .",
    "[ fig : logslambda07 ]",
    "we have made theoretical progress towards the calculation of @xmath2 decay amplitudes via the combination of lattice qcd and @xmath1pt .",
    "we find it feasible to determine all the lecs for constructing @xmath32 at nlo in the chiral expansion .",
    "a quenched numerical study is in progress @xcite . as for the @xmath33 channel , we find the situation to be considerably more complicated @xcite .",
