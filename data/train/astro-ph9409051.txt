    "the work of morris and thorne@xcite has led to a great deal of interest in the formation and properties of three - dimensional wormholes ( topological connections between separated regions of space - time ) that are solutions of the einstein s equations of general relativity . subsequently visser@xcite suggested a wormhole configuration , a flat - space wormhole that is framed by `` struts '' of an exotic material , a variant of the cosmic string solutions of einstein s equations@xcite . to satisfy the einstein field equations the cosmic string framing visser wormholes",
    "must have a _ negative _ string tension@xcite of @xmath0 and therefore a negative mass density .",
    "however , for the total mass of the wormhole system , the negative mass density of the struts should be combined with the effective positive mass density of the wormhole s gravitational field .",
    "the overall object could , depending on the details of the model , have positive , zero , or negative net external mass .",
    "note that in hypothesizing the existence of such a wormhole , one has to abandon the averaged null energy condition@xcite .",
    "therefore , the hypotheses underlying the positive mass theorem no longer apply and there is nothing , in principle , to prevent the occurrence of negative total mass@xcite .",
    "some of the visser wormhole configurations have the shape of a cube or other geometrical solid , but one particularly simple configuration is a flat - space wormhole mouth framed by a single continuous loop of exotic cosmic string .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that the inflationary phase of the early universe might produce closed loops of cosmic string .",
    "it is therefore at least plausible that a similar mechanism might produce negative - mass string loops framing stable visser wormholes .",
    "if a particle with positive electric charge passes through such a wormhole , its lines of force , threading through the wormhole aperture , give the entrance mouth an effective positive charge ( flux lines radiating outward ) and give the exit mouth an effective negative charge ( flux lines converging inward . ) similarly , when a massive object passes through the wormhole , the same back - reaction mechanism might cause the entrance mouth to gain mass and the exit mouth to lose mass@xcite",
    ". now let us consider a stable visser wormhole with near - zero mass residing in the mass - energy rich environment of the early universe .",
    "the expected density fluctuations of the early universe suggest that the separated wormhole mouths will reside in regions of differing mass density , leading to a mass flow between the regions they connect .",
    "as this mass passes through the wormhole , the entrance mouth will gain mass while the exit mouth will lose mass by the same amount .",
    "soon , if the mass flow continues , the exit wormhole mouth will acquire a net negative mass .",
    "this will lead to a gravitational instability , since the positive mass mouth will attract more mass through its aperture while the negative mass mouth will gravitationally repel nearby mass@xcite .",
    "thus the positive - negative imbalance will be fed by gravity and will continue to grow .",
    "if this process proceeds without interruption , the exit wormhole mouth might develop a stellar - scale negative mass .",
    "visser wormholes , therefore , provide at least one motivation for seriously considering the possible existence of naturally occurring astronomical objects of sizable negative mass .",
    "we have tried to sketch only one scenario for the possible existence of negative mass objects .",
    "we must , however , point out that the non - existence of such objects would not rule out the existence of natural wormholes , since their properties are highly model - dependent .",
    "also , observations providing evidence of negative mass objects would not require the existence of natural wormholes , since other negative - mass objects could conceivably exist , but would indicate a direct violation of the averaged null energy condition mentioned above .",
    "negative - mass objects , while repelling all nearby mass ( positive or negative ) , would themselves be attracted@xcite by the mass of a nearby galaxy and might form part of a galactic halo .",
    "they would have unusual gravitational properties that could produce detectable gravitational lensing effects .",
    "these lensing effects , for the same absolute mass , are of the same magnitude as those recently detected for massive cosmic halo objects ( machos)@xcite , but , as we will show below , are qualitatively different in shape .",
    "we here examine in detail the lensing effects of gravitationally negative anomalous compact halo objects ( gnachos ) .",
    "naively , if a gravitationally attractive positive mass acts as a converging lens that brightens a background star , one might expect a gravitationally repulsive negative mass to act as a diverging lens that causes a background star to briefly grow dimmer .",
    "actually the lensing of a negative mass is not analogous to a diverging lens . in certain circumstances",
    "it can produce more light enhancement than does the lensing of an equivalent positive mass .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the geometry of starlight that is gravitationally lensed by an object of negative mass .",
    "starlight is radiated from the stellar source @xmath1 and is detected by the observer at @xmath2 . a gravitationally negative object",
    "@xmath3 lies between source and observer at an impact - parameter distance @xmath4 from the source - detector axis @xmath5 .",
    "an off - axis ray of light passes near the negative mass object @xmath3 , coming within a distance @xmath6 of it , and is deflected@xcite by an angle @xmath7 = @xmath8 is the absolute value of the deflecting mass , and @xmath9 is the velocity of light .",
    "the angle @xmath7 is an external angle of the triangle formed by the direct and deflected rays .",
    "this triangle has interior angles @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so @xmath7 = @xmath12 .",
    "if the detector - source distance is @xmath13 and the detector - mass distance is @xmath14 , then we have the following equations : @xmath15 these lead to the dimensionless quadratic equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimensionless distance of closest approach of the deflected ray , @xmath18 is the dimensionless impact parameter distance of the deflecting mass , and @xmath19 is the characteristic gravitational length scale of the problem . for a positive lensing mass , @xmath20 would be the radius of the einstein ring produced when the mass is positioned at zero impact parameter ( @xmath4=0 ) .",
    "to give some feeling for this length scale , if the stellar source @xmath1 is in the large magellanic cloud and a negative lensing mass @xmath3 of one solar mass is in the galactic halo , then @xmath13 = 2 @xmath21 10@xmath22  m , @xmath14 = 5 @xmath21 10@xmath23  m , and @xmath20 = 1.5 @xmath21 10@xmath24  m or about 10  au .",
    "solving quadratic ( [ eq:4 ] ) for @xmath25 gives two solutions : @xmath26.\\ ] ] when @xmath27 there are two real solutions of the quadratic , corresponding to two rays that are deflected to the observer .",
    "when @xmath28 there are no real solutions , indicating that the deflection is blocking all rays from reaching the observer . at @xmath29",
    "= 2 , @xmath30 = @xmath31 = @xmath32 and , as will be discussed below , the rainbow - like caustic occurs , allowing many rays to reach the observer and producing a dramatic brightening of the background star . fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows this schematically .",
    "the negative mass deflects rays in inverse proportion to their distance of closest approach , creating a shadowed umbra region where light from the source is extinguished . at the edges of the umbra the light rays",
    "accumulate to form the caustic and give a very large increase in light intensity .",
    "the intensity falls slowly to normal at larger transverse distances .",
    "if the unmodified intensity of the background star is @xmath33 and the altered intensity of the background star in the presence of the negative lensing mass for each solution is @xmath34 , then the partial amplification factors @xmath35 are given by@xcite : @xmath36 the overall relative intensity @xmath37 is the modulation in brightness of the background star as detected by the observer , and is given by : @xmath38    it is interesting to compare this with the similar expression for relative intensity @xmath39 of a background source that is lensed by an object of _ positive _ mass : @xmath40 for the same dimensionless impact parameter @xmath29 with @xmath27 , it is always true that @xmath41 , so for large impact parameters a negative mass actually provides _ more _ light enhancement through lensing than an equivalent positive mass . when @xmath42 , the overall intensity @xmath43 , a condition indicating a caustic at which light rays from many trajectories are deflected toward the observer .",
    "it provides a distinctive and unusual signature for negative - mass lensing .",
    "the intensity modulation that is actually observed occurs when the lensing mass , which is assumed to be moving with transverse velocity @xmath44 , crosses near the source - detector axis @xmath5 with a minimum impact parameter @xmath45 and a minimum dimensionless impact parameter @xmath46 = @xmath47 .",
    "the time - dependent impact parameter is therefore @xmath48 , and @xmath49 where @xmath50 = @xmath51 is the transit time across the distance of the minimum impact parameter and is the characteristic time scale of the problem .",
    "[ eq:8 ] and [ eq:10 ] are used to calculate the light enhancement profile of the process , taking @xmath52 = 0 when @xmath53 , and there are no real solutions to eqn .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows these light enhancement profiles , plotting @xmath52 vs. @xmath54 for a range of minimum dimensionless impact parameters ranging from @xmath46 = 0.50 to 2.20 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows similar light enhancement profiles for a positive mass of the same size and range of @xmath46 values .",
    "as can be seen , the light enhancement profiles are qualitatively different for positive and negative lensing masses of the same magnitude and geometry . in particular",
    ", the negative mass curves are much sharper , show stronger but briefer light enhancements , and for @xmath55 show a precipitous drop to zero intensity , i. e. , extinction of the light from the source when the lensing mass deflects all light from @xmath1 away from the observer .",
    "such a signature might possibly be confused with that of occultation by a dark foreground object . however , an occultation would not be preceded by a dramatic rise in intensity and might , if the object had a significant atmosphere , have different light profiles at different wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the negative gravitational lensing presented here , if observed , would provide distinctive and unambiguous evidence for the existence of a foreground object of negative mass .",
    "the calculations presented above show that objects of negative gravitational mass , if they exist , can provide a very distinctive light enhancement profile .",
    "since three groups are presently conducting searches for the gravitational lensing of more normal positive mass objects , we suggest that these searches be slightly broadened so that the signatures of the objects discussed above are not overlooked by over - specific data selection criteria and software cuts .",
    "we recommend that macho search data be analyzed for evidence of gnachos .",
