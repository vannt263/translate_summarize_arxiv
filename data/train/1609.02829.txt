    "note that this system does not take into account permutation equivalences , and so the set to which @xmath37 converges is not the space of inequivalent hadamards , but rather the space of inequivalent hadamards together with all copies of this space derived from permutations of the cores of its members .",

    "the center manifold theorem provides a means to bound the local dimension of the space of degenerate fixed points , @xmath66 , containing @xmath38 since the center manifold at @xmath38 must contain @xmath66 .",
    "thus , by applying the theorem to the gradient system  ( [ eq : gradsys ] ) , we can estimate the local dimension of the space of dephased complex hadamards at @xmath0 by computing the dimension of the center manifold at @xmath0 .",
    "this construction is reminiscent of the definition of the * defect * of a @xmath4 hadamard matrix @xmath0 as the dimension of the solution space of the real linear system @xmath67_{i , k}[h^*]_{j , k}\\left([r]_{i , k}-[r]_{j , k}\\right ) & = 0 , \\text { for }   1 \\leq i < j \\leq d,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a matrix of variables .",

    "the dimension of the center manifold of system ( [ eq : gradsys ] ) at a hadamard @xmath0 is actually equal to the defect @xmath73 since we are linearizing the dephased hadamard conditions in both cases . in particular , recall that if the defect of a hadamard matrix is 0 , then it must be isolated . likewise ,",
    "if there does not exist a center subspace of @xmath74 at @xmath23 , then the stable subspace is @xmath34-dimensional and all points sufficiently close to @xmath23 must flow to it .",
    "since a center manifold is not necessarily ( and not usually ) comprised entirely of fixed points , the center manifold theorem could improve upon an overestimate of the local dimension of the space of complex hadamards suggested by the the dimension of the center subspace and the defect . if @xmath75 , then @xmath23 is not a complex hadamard matrix and therefore any flow on the center manifold , as slow as it may be , will shrink the bound given by the defect .",
    "a center manifold reduction is typically accomplished by performing a change of coordinates on the system into eigen - coordinates so that the center manifold can be written as a graph over the center subspace .",
    "this becomes impractical for a high - dimensional systems since the process first requires diagonalization of ( large ) symbolic matrices .",
    "we have adopted an alternative method in which the center manifold , @xmath49 , is written as an embedding over the @xmath51-dimensional center subspace , @xmath76 span(@xmath77 )  @xcite .",
    "one begins by writing @xmath78 and expands @xmath79 in a taylor expansion by repeated differentiation of the vector field . by observing that the center manifold is an invariant set ( i.e. the flow at a point on the @xmath49 is tangent to @xmath49 there )",
    "one derives @xmath80 for some real - valued functions @xmath81 , which can be shown to be the time - rates - of - change of the embedding parameters , @xmath82 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "as one expands @xmath85 , they also approximate each @xmath86 and thus the flow on the center manifold .",
    "notice , if flow is nowhere present on the center manifold , then @xmath87 represents a local embedding of dephased hadamards and so this framework yields a series approximation of the manifold of interest .",
    "the principal computational limitation is the memory requirements of storing high - order tensors , which are needed if one wishes to expand the center manifold to high orders and which grow exponentially with order .",
    "this is exaggerated for large matrices , since the base of the exponential growth depends on the order of the hadamard .",
    "although identification of flow on the center manifold may not require expansion to high orders  as shown by example in section  [ sec:4x4 ]  it should be noted that the _ absence _ of flow at any finite order can not guarantee that flow is not present at some higher order .",
    "it is known that every @xmath18 hadamard matrix is equivalent to a member of the continuous one - parameter family of inequivalent hadamards  @xcite , @xmath88 moreover , for all but one choice of parameter @xmath89 $ ] , the defect of @xmath90 coincides with the dimension of this topological circle of inequivalent hadamards . however , for @xmath91 , when the hadamard is real , the defect jumps from 1 to 3 .",
    "thus , this is an example where we know that the defect overestimates the local freedom of inequivalent hadamards .",
    "this section serves as a illustrative example of the methodology developed in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "in particular we use the center manifold reduction to show what is already known : the space of inequivalent hadamards near @xmath92 is one - dimensional , despite what the defect there might suggest .    for the remainder of this section we will denote the one - parameter family of inequivalent @xmath18 hadamards as @xmath93 .",

    "as stated , for every parameter value ( other than @xmath91 ) there are exactly 8 negative eigenvalues and 1 eigenvalue equal to 0 .",

    "as we have seen , the center subspace at a hadamard , @xmath0 , must contain all vectors tangent to dephased families stemming from @xmath0 , affine or otherwise .",
    "for example , the vector @xmath218 with 1 s in the coordinates corresponding to the core entries of @xmath219 whose phases depend on @xmath121 ( and 0 s elsewhere ) will be in the center subspace because it is tangent to the line of hadamards , @xmath219 .",
    "thus , one can search for affine families by considering linear combinations of vectors in a basis for the center subspace and introducing appropriately - scaled parameters in the phases corresponding to nonzero coordinates .",
    "contained in the kernel of @xmath220 is the vector @xmath221 shown here as the lower - right @xmath222 submatrix of @xmath223 to establish its relationship with the core of @xmath224 . by computing @xmath225 ( where @xmath121 is a free parameter ) we uncover a one - parameter affine family ; explicitly @xmath226 similarly , the null vectors of @xmath220 , expressed in the cores of @xmath227 together reveal the two - parameter family @xmath228 @xmath229    @xmath230 and @xmath231 were verified to be hadamard by symbolic computation .",
    "interestingly , these families and @xmath232 are independent in the sense that they do not , together , form a three - parameter affine family .",
    "that being said , a center manifold reduction did not rule out the possibility that they belong to some unifying family that has yet to be discovered .",
    "we applied the same approach to the non - di - type matrix @xmath233 whose membership in a three - parameter affine family @xmath234 was already established by szllsi  @xcite .",
    "notice that the defect of @xmath235 is 16 , and so there may be more parameters which can be introduced to the family @xmath236 . towards identifying these additional parameters , we searched for and found a basis , @xmath237 , for the kernel of @xmath238 whose elements each describe a one - parameter affine family stemming from @xmath235 . in table",
    "[ tab:16basis ] we list the nonzero coordinates of each @xmath239  each of which happens to be 1 or -1  by identifying the coordinates having either value .",
    ".nonzero coordinates of the vectors in the basis @xmath240 for @xmath238 .",
    "a nonzero coordinate has value 1 or -1 , indicated by the subcolumn to which it belongs .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^ , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab:16basis ]    for each @xmath241 , the collection of matrices @xmath242  where @xmath243 is a parameter  is an affine family .",
    "this does not say that there is a 16-dimensional affine family stemming from @xmath235 ; in fact , simultaneous inclusion of all @xmath243 destroys the hadamard property for most choices of parameters .",
    "however , many combinations of inclusion of parameters do give two- and three - dimensional families .",
    "for example , @xmath244 another example of a three - parameter family found among these vectors is @xmath245 note that no combination of four ( or more ) of these vectors give an affine family , although this does not guarantee one does not exist .",
    "the existence of this particular basis for the kernel of @xmath238 does provide one possibility for the genesis of a 16-dimensional center subspace : certainly the defect must be at least 16 to account for the intersection of 16 , possibly permutation - equivalent , one - parameter affine ( sub-)families passing through @xmath235 .",
    "in this paper we have given a new interpretation of the defect of a hadamard matrix as the dimension of a center subspace of a gradient flow whose fixed points are exactly the dephased hadamard matrices .",
    "we have applied this technique to a simple example , using dynamical systems theory to explain why the defect of the real @xmath18 hadamard is larger than the complex members of the affine family @xmath122 .",
    "we have used tools from dynamical systems theory to prove that the @xmath246 for all values of @xmath51 and have presented a new type of evidence in support of existing conjectures concerning @xmath15 hadamards .",
    "finally we have used our perspective to uncover new @xmath214 affine families .",
    "it is a virtue of the formalism built in section  [ sec : theory ] that we need not have explicit values for the taylor coefficients of the functions @xmath86 to conclude that flow on the center manifold exists .",
    "it is a shortcoming of center manifold reduction , in general , that it can not prove flow does _ not _ exist on some part of a center manifold .",
    "this limitation is a consequence of the fact that , _ a priori _ , one has no knowledge of the smallest order in the taylor expansion where one might first encounter nonzero contribution to the time - rates - of - change of the embedding parameters .",
    "we are not certain that our application is bound with this deficiency and are hopeful that a deeper understanding of the derivatives of the vector field @xmath74 may be exploited to further expand the use of dynamical systems theory to attack questions about complex hadamards . in particular ,",
    "if one could show that all coefficients in the expansion of the time - rates - of - change of the embedding parameters vanish in the center manifold reduction of @xmath74 at a hadamard @xmath0 , then one would prove the existence of a positive - dimensional family of complex hadamards stemming from @xmath0 .",
    "finally , vectors in a basis for the center subspace of @xmath247 at an order-@xmath248 matrix @xmath0 may be tangent to affine families stemming from @xmath0 .",
    "this fact can be exploited to find new affine families , in the manner of section  [ sec : examples ] .",
