    "the capture process of a negative kaon in a nucleus recently raised renewed interest in the search of the so - called deeply bound @xmath10-nuclear systems , predicted by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "these states consist of few - body strange ( s=1 ) systems composed of nucleons strongly bound to a @xmath4 .",
    "the strength of the @xmath11 attractive interaction , in the i=0 configuration , allows for the stability of the system , as well as for its compactness @xcite .",
    "the binding energies predicted for these states are rather sizeable , and the @xmath12 interaction should be so strong ( according to the hypothesis of these authors ) that the widths of these aggregates may be very narrow .",
    "in fact , the main decay mode of the @xmath13 system is @xmath14 .",
    "however , if the potential well is deep enough , even the @xmath14 channel can turn out to be energetically forbidden . in this framework , these states are expected to be formed with larger probabilities in lighter nuclei .    a signal with features compatible to these theoretical expectations was recently found for the ( @xmath0-three nucleon ) system by exploiting the missing mass method ( kek - ps e471 experiment ) @xcite , and for the ( @xmath0-two nucleon ) aggregate by studying the invariant mass of the system ( finuda at lnf ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 s were stopped in both experiments , on a liquid @xmath8he target in the first case , and on thin solid targets of several nuclear species ( @xmath1li , @xmath15li , @xmath2c ) in the second .",
    "e471 claimed evidence for the existence of two different deeply bound @xmath0-states , dubbed as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , observed in the inclusive proton and neutron spectra respectively .",
    "they correspond to binding energies of about 193 and 169 mev , are less than 21 mev wide and both decay in the @xmath18 channel . on the other hand , finuda observed a structure decaying into a back - to - back @xmath19 pair at a mass of about 2255 mev ( corresponding to a binding energy @xmath20 mev ) , with @xmath21 mev .",
    "a further hint for the existence of a strange multibaryon , namely @xmath22o , with a @xmath0 bound with a binding energy of @xmath23 mev was reported by kishimoto _",
    "_ @xcite by exploiting the @xmath24 reaction at 930 mev/@xmath3 , again based on a missing - mass analysis .",
    "aside from the mentioned model , other theoretical approaches exist . some of them admit the existence of bound kaon - nuclear states but with shallower binding potentials @xcite ; therefore the expected widths of these states are too large to allow their experimental observation .    a dynamical approach , that allows the polarization of the nucleus by the strong @xmath0-nucleus interaction ,",
    "was recently proposed by mare@xmath25 _",
    "_ @xcite . in their calculations",
    "the depth of the @xmath4-nucleus potential is density dependent , and the existence of rather narrow ( slightly less than 50 mev wide ) deeply bound kaonic states is expected in nuclei heavier than @xmath2c , for a deep binding energy in the range @xmath26 mev .",
    "this approach suggests that , for the much stronger nuclear polarization obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for a target as light as @xmath8he , any @xmath4-nucleus deeply bound state would be too broad to allow clear observation .",
    "another theoretical argument against the existence of deeply bound kaonic states was put forward by oset _",
    "@xcite , who criticize the first theoretical approach simply showing that the observed signals can be easily explained in terms of few body @xmath0 absorption reactions and their elementary kinematics .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath0 absorption in nuclei with nucleons emission is indeed a well known process which occurs with a capture rate of the order of 10 - 20% , so the possibility of observing pions and nucleons in the final state of such processes is sizeable , and this simple interpretation seems to be quite realistic .",
    "we must also recall that the experimental observations obtained so far are not in perfect agreement with the akaishi - yamazaki model expectations .",
    "in fact , e471 @xmath27 and @xmath28 states have a binding energy much larger than the predictions from the model . moreover , their isospin is necessarily equal to one , contrary to the expectation of a singlet isospin configuration to preferentially allow for deeply bound states .",
    "even the observation of a @xmath29 bound system by finuda is not completely consistent with the features required by this model , especially as far as the isospin and the expected width are concerned .",
    "therefore , the quest for the existence of such states is still open and experimental confirmations are eagerly awaited .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of a study of the proton spectra ( inclusive and semi - inclusive ) emitted in the interaction of @xmath0 at rest with @xmath1li and @xmath2c nuclei , to be compared to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on @xmath8he .",
    "the same missing mass analysis technique followed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite has been basically applied in the present case also .",
    "first results of this analysis are reported in ref .",
    "the experiment was performed with the magnetic spectrometer finuda , dedicated to hypernuclear physics and installed at the da@xmath30ne @xmath31 factory at laboratori nazionali di frascati of infn .",
    "details on the structure of the finuda spectrometer , on the measured performance as well as on the conditions of the data taking in the 2003 - 2004 exploratory run can be found in refs .",
    "we recall that the detector features momentum resolution from @xmath32 to @xmath33 fwhm ( depending on the mass and momentum of the charged particle ) , an angular acceptance close to @xmath34 sr and good particle identification .",
    "the main apparatus features are briefly sketched in the following . from the beam axis",
    "outward three parts can be distinguished , as described hereafter .    _",
    "the interaction / target region_. it is located at the center of the apparatus . here",
    "the kaons from the @xmath31 decay are identified by means of a 12-thin - slab scintillator array , with the resolution @xmath35 ps .",
    "this barrel is surrounded by an octagonal array of silicon microstrips ( isim , acronym for internal silicon microstrips ) providing a first precise ( @xmath36 @xmath37 m ) position measurement for the determination of the interaction point of the @xmath38 pairs from of the @xmath31 decay , in the facing target modules . the target array consists of eight slabs facing the microstrip modules and placed a few millimeters from them , thin enough to stop the @xmath0 as close as possible to the outer surface of the tile .",
    "different solid materials have been chosen as targets in the 2003 - 2004 data taking ( @xmath1li , @xmath15li , @xmath2c , @xmath39al , @xmath40v ) ;    _ the external tracking device_. it consists of four layers of position sensitive detectors , arranged in coaxial geometry and immersed in a helium atmosphere to minimize multiple scattering , inside a 1.0 t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "facing the target tiles a further array of ten silicon microstrip modules is placed , with basically the same features as the internal ones ( osim , outer silicon microstrips ) .",
    "the next tracking devices are :    \\i ) two octagonal arrays of he - ic@xmath41h@xmath42 ( 70 - 30 ) filled low mass drift chambers , featuring a spatial resolution @xmath43 @xmath37 m and @xmath44 cm ;    \\ii ) a straw tube detector , at 1.1 m from the beam axis , composed of six layers of longitudinal and stereo tubes providing a spatial resolution @xmath43 @xmath37 m and @xmath45 cm ;    _ the external time - of - flight detector_. the outer tof detector is a barrel of 72 scintillator slabs , 10 cm thick , providing signals for the first level trigger and time of flight measurements , with a time resolution of @xmath46 ps .",
    "it allows also the detection of neutrons with a @xmath47 efficiency and an energy resolution of 8 mev fwhm , for 80 mev neutrons .    out of five different nuclear species used for the eight targets , only @xmath1li and @xmath2c",
    "were considered in the present analysis .",
    "data collected in the 2003 - 2004 exploratory run were used .",
    "figure [ fig1]a ) shows the inclusive proton spectra for @xmath1li ( two targets ) and fig . [ fig1]b ) for @xmath2c ( three targets ) , not acceptance corrected .",
    "the acceptance correction is effective only in the lower momentum region of both plots , and does nt affect the shape in the region beyond 400 mev/@xmath3 , where it is basically constant . in the lower momentum region it is a monotonic rising function .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for both the targets are in agreement , within the statistical error , except for the value of @xmath49 for the first @xmath1li target , which is compatible with the @xmath48 measurement from the same target within 2@xmath50 only .",
    "we assume that a total statistical error as big as the largest of the two measurements on the same target can be assigned to their weighted mean value .",
    "therefore , one gets for the weighted means of the evaluated rates for the two @xmath1li targets ( denoted in the following as 1 and 2 ) the two capture rates : @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; their mean value is @xmath53 , to be compared to previous measurements of the @xmath0 induced reaction obtained in bubble chamber experiments .",
    "@xcite reports a multinucleonic @xmath0 capture rate at rest of the order of @xmath47 in deuterium , @xmath54 in helium and @xmath55 in carbon : the absorption rate is assumed to remain rather constant beyond @xmath56 , perhaps increasing slowly for heavier nuclei where the absorption most likely occurs on the nuclear surface . out of all the multinucleonic @xmath0 capture events in helium , according to ref .",
    "@xcite the rate for @xmath57 is @xmath58 , while for @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "these figures are in fair agreement with the results obtained in the present analysis .",
    "they can be directly compared for the case of the @xmath61 reaction where the @xmath62 or @xmath63 in the final state can be assumed as spectators .",
    "the inclusive proton momentum spectrum in @xmath0 reactions induced in @xmath1li exhibits a sharp structure at about 500 mev/@xmath3 which can be rather easily explained as due to the interaction of the @xmath0 on a ",
    "deuteron cluster in the @xmath1li nucleus , leading to the two - body final state @xmath64 .",
    "both the observed proton and the @xmath5 from the @xmath6 decay have the right kinematic features to confirm that they belong to this reaction .",
    "moreover , the rate for such a reaction is compatible with the rates of similar reactions observed in helium bubble chamber experiments .",
    "since the signal is quite similar to the observations of e471 in @xmath0 induced reactions on a @xmath8he target , the peaks observed by the two experiments could have the same nature , and maybe they are simply due to a two - body reaction where a @xmath0 interacts on a  quasi \" deuteron , both in @xmath1li and in @xmath8he .",
    "this possibility makes the claim for a deeply bound state unnecessary . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of such a signal in the spectra out of @xmath2c targets strengthens this hypothesis , as a similar two - body mechanism would be possible even on @xmath2c nuclei , but very difficult to observe because of the size of the whole nuclear system and the dilution effects it entails .    thus , we point out that the possibility of selective capture by clusters in nuclei can be the source of ambiguities in missing mass experiments .",
    "invariant mass measurements , exclusive and more precise , would probably help to better clarify the interesting subject of the existence of such states , supported by complementary information obtained with the missing mass method .",
    "in fact , it must be reminded that the first experimental observation with the invariant mass technique , performed by finuda , although more precise , presents a few inconsistencies compared to the expectations of some theoretical models .",
    "so , on one side more experimental data are urgently needed , to confirm the observed structures and to check for possible different decay patterns . on the other hand ,",
    "further theoretical calculations are required to explain the experimental observations and possibly discard their interpretation as @xmath4-nuclear states .",
