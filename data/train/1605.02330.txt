    "recently , due to the ubiquitous presence of wireless devices , wireless power transfer ( wpt)@xcite has grabbed the attention of researchers .",
    "wpt has huge application in scenarios such as sensor networks in a border area or a toxic zone , where regular replacement of batteries is almost impossible .",
    "traditionally , wireless sensor nodes rely on batteries with limited lifetime to transmit data to a base station . in a wireless power harvesting scenario , along with the base station , power beacons are also deployed to recharge the sensor nodes . in the absence of any internal power source , these sensor nodes follow a _ harvest - then - transmit _ @xcite scheme to communicate with the base station .    in practice",
    ", sensor networks and power beacons may be deployed by different authorities . as a result",
    ", one needs a mutually beneficial scheme that ensures _ energy trading _ between both parties .",
    "such scenarios involving multiple self - interested agents can be studied in a game theoretic framework .",
    "the authors in @xcite have studied energy trading between power beacons and their users by formulating a stackelberg game .",
    "our modeling approach and analysis are different from those in @xcite .",
    "unlike @xcite , where single antenna power beacons are considered , we consider a _ multi - antenna power beacon _ @xcite .",
    "such multi - antenna systems can improve the efficiency of energy transfer by employing beamforming .",
    "contrarily , a base station with a single antenna can cater to the requirements of low data rate sensor networks and is considered in our work .    in @xcite ,",
    "perfect channel state information ( csi ) between the power beacons and the sensor node is assumed .",
    "but , in real - world scenarios , one requires training signals to estimate channel gains and a higher accuracy can only be obtained at the cost of a higher estimation time . for multi - antenna systems ,",
    "the issue is more critical compared to single antenna as efficient beamforming requires accurate csi .",
    "also , unlike capacity , a logarithmic ( sub - linear ) function of channel gain , harvested energy is a quadratic ( super - linear ) function of channel gain and , therefore , inaccurate csi has further degrading effects .",
    "therefore , considering imperfect csi ( e.g. , based only on path - loss ) for the power beacon  which has multiple antennas  is more realistic , and this is considered in our work .",
    "also , we generalize the model by considering multiple sensor nodes .    due to imperfect csi @xcite ,",
    "our problem formulation differs from that in @xcite significantly . in @xcite , utilities are deterministic , whereas , in our formulation the base station s utility is based on a _",
    "term in the proposed stackelberg game .",
    "as we can not directly calculate the data throughput , we consider a utility function that is based on _ throughput non - outage probability_probability of throughput being above a predefined threshold .",
    "outage probability of an adhoc network with wireless power transfer was evaluated in @xcite in a non - game theoretic setting and significantly differs from ours . also , we differ from @xcite as in those works , the sensor network and power beacon belonged to the same deploying authority .",
    "our work ensures quality of sensing by keeping the data throughput for each sensor node above a certain threshold .",
    "outage occurs when the throughput goes below that threshold .",
    "therefore , we would like to improve the minimum non - outage probability over the sensor nodes ( equivalent to decreasing the maximum outage probability ) by asking the power beacon to adjust the antenna gains appropriately while transmitting sufficient power .",
    "the base station should compensate the power beacon monetarily for its service .",
    "so , the utility of the base station should include the revenue generated due to non - outage of data throughput and compensation paid to the power beacon ( with appropriate scaling ) .",
    "the utility of the power beacon should consist of the revenue generated by selling power , minus the operational cost .    due to intractability of the throughput non - outage probability",
    ", we bound it using markov s and jensen s inequalities .",
    "we then formulate a stackelberg game with these utility functions whose equilibrium simultaneously maximizes the respective utilities .",
    "the solution of this stackelberg game decides the optimal antenna weights and transmit power for the power beacon for single sensor node scenario . for the multiple sensor scenario , we provide computationally efficient solutions by bounding the base station s utility function .",
    "the main contributions with respect to prior works ( including @xcite ) are : ( i ) formulation of a stackelberg game for multiple sensor nodes with a multiple antenna power beacon assuming imperfect csi between the sensor nodes and the power beacon , ( ii ) analytical evaluation of the optimal solution for the stackelberg game for a single sensor node , ( iii ) the equilibrium strategies ( power and price ) of the players corresponding to the upper and lower bounds on the base station s utility for the most general case involving multiple sensor nodes , ( iv ) comparison among the solutions provided by the bounds , a relaxed semidefinite program and exhaustive search .",
    "the system model consists of one base station ( bs ) , one multi - antenna power beacon ( pb ) and @xmath0 sensor nodes ( sn ) , indexed by @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the power beacon has @xmath2 antennas , whereas , the base station and sensors are equipped with a single antenna each .",
    "all sensor nodes can communicate directly with the base station .",
    "we adopt the _ harvest - then - transmit _ model @xcite .",
    "we consider a slotted system in which each time slot is divided into two parts : ( i ) in the first part , which consists of a fraction @xmath3 of the total time slot , the power beacon transmits power to the sensor nodes for energy harvesting ; ( ii ) in the second part ( of duration @xmath4 fraction of the time slot ) , the sensor nodes transmit data ( information ) to the base station using the harvested energy . in several scenarios ,",
    "different authorities may deploy the sensor network and the power beacons ; so , the base station needs to negotiate with the power beacon for wireless power transfer . in the proposed stackelberg game , the power beacon acts as a seller and charges the base station at the rate @xmath5 per unit power and as a consequence , the base station asks for @xmath6 units of power from the power beacon .    without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that each time slot is of unit length .",
    "during the first part , energy harvested at the @xmath7th sensor node is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 complex channel gain vector from the power beacon to the @xmath7th sensor node , and @xmath11 is the complex antenna gain vector of the same dimension .",
    "the second part of the time slot is divided into @xmath0 equal parts . and",
    "transmission times assigned to the @xmath0 sensor nodes based on requirements .",
    "many tdma systems @xcite use predefined time slots for operational simplicity .",
    "we have assumed equal time slots as an example . ]",
    "each sensor node transmits data to the base station in its assigned time slot by completely spending the energy harvested during the first part .",

    "we assume that the base station has perfect information about all @xmath14 ( can be obtained using training signals ) , whereas , the base station has imperfect information about all @xmath9 ( as mentioned before ) . due to imperfect csi",
    ", throughput can not be calculated ; therefore , the base station would like to maximize _ throughput non - outage probability _ given by : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a predefined threshold . to ensure quality of sensing",
    ", the base station would try to improve the minimum @xmath18 over the sensor nodes by purchasing appropriate amount of power and by asking the power beacon to adjust the antenna gains .",
    "however , at the same time , expenditure on power should be reduced , leading to a weighted metric .",
    "we model the imperfect csi between the power beacon and the @xmath7th sensor node in the following manner : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the estimated channel and the error @xmath21 is a random vector , which is distributed according to circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the covariance matrix .",
    "consequently , from , @xmath18 is a logarithmic function of a nonlinear combination of multiple gaussian random variables .",

    "note that if @xmath31 , then the utility is negative and power beacon would refuse to sell power .",
