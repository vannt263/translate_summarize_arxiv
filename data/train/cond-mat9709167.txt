    "a growing number of compounds have been synthesized whose crystal structure consists of weakly coupled metallic layers .",
    "foremost among these are the cuprate metals where the two - dimensional nature electronic structure has provoked much speculation about the nature of the resulting metallic state .",
    "the issue of whether in - plane excitations can move coherently between copper oxide planes remains contentious  @xcite .",
    "several other metallic compounds with a layered structure  for example organic compounds based on the bis - ethylenedithiotetrathiafulvalene molecule and other metallic oxides such as @xmath4do possess a fermi surface which is shaped like a slightly warped cylinder  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study magnetotransport in a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) metal in order to provide a benchmark against which more exotic types of behavior can be compared .",
    "specifically we study out - of - plane transport using the relaxation - time approximation in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "our main result is that there is a `` kapitza '' region  @xcite where the transverse magnetoresistance @xmath5 is proportional to the applied magnetic field .",
    "we justify this with an analytic expression for the magnetoresistance in the quasi - two - dimensional limit which is valid for _ arbitrary _ magnetic fields .",
    "we also obtain an expression for the magnetoresistance with any degree of unixial anisotropy that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "the study of magnetotransport within the boltzmann formalism is long established and is well described in a number of classic texts@xcite . interpreting magnetoresistance measurements",
    "is complicated by the fact that the magnetoresistance is identically zero for an isotropic metal .",
    "the amount of anisotropy determines the measured magnetoresistance , which is therefore rather sensitive to the detailed properties of the material .",
    "analytic results are usually limited to the very weak or very high - magnetic - field regimes . at low fields",
    "the zener - jones expansion yields a magnetoresistance quadratic in the magnetic field with a coefficient depending on the variation of the mean - free - path around the fermi surface . at high fields the magnetoresistance saturates when current flow is along closed fermi - surface directions or maintains a quadratic field dependence for currents along open fermi - surface directions ( see page 118 of ref .  ) . to our knowledge",
    ", there have been no analytic expressions for the magnetoresistance of a realistic bandstructure which interpolate between these known limits .    in this paper",
    "we present a calculation which , while respecting the high- and low - field results mentioned above , also applies at intermediate fields where we find a linear magnetoresistance .",
    "we have obtained an analytic expression for the magnetoresistance , valid in the limit of strong anisotropy , which we believe to be the first straightforward example of a magnetoresistance formula valid for all magnetic fields .",
    "this result should prove useful in characterizing the properties of quasi - two - dimensional metals using transport measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present a simple calculation of the magnetoconductance that illustrates how having a warped cylindrical fermi surface can give rise to a linear magnetoresistance .",
    "we then present a more formal solution of the boltzmann equation and derive the conductivity tensor for arbitrary levels of anisotropy .",
    "our analytic result emerges as a limiting case .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of these results for experiment and compare with known data .",
    "we consider a metal with the following dispersion relation @xmath6 we have adopted the customary notation that directions in reciprocal space are labeled @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 while the corresponding real space lattice is defined by the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath3 directions .",
    "it describes free particles in the @xmath12 plane coupled by a perpendicular transfer integral , @xmath1 in the @xmath3 direction to adjacent planes .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath3 gives the spacing between planes that can be combined with @xmath1 to form an effective mass for out - of - plane motion @xmath13 ( this is the @xmath9-axis band mass in the limit @xmath14 when the fermi surface forms a closed spheroid . )",
    "we begin with an approximate derivation of the new regime by considering the magnetoconductance to lowest order in @xmath1 .",
    "chambers expression  @xcite for the components of the conductivity tensor in a magnetic field within the relaxation - time approximation is @xmath15 for each area element of the fermi surface , @xmath16 , we integrate the velocity @xmath17 measured along a semiclassical quasiparticle orbit .",
    "these orbits are defined by the lorentz equation of motion @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in configurations where the magnetic field is parallel to the planes and the current is flowing perpendicular to the planes [ see fig .",
    "( [ approxorbits]a ) ] .    .",
    "( a ) the magnetic field lies in the plane and the current flows out of the plane .",
    "the linear magnetoresistance regime occurs when the magnetic flux through a loop defined by the in - plane mean - free - path , @xmath20 , and the plane separation , @xmath3 , becomes of the order of a flux quantum or greater .",
    "( b ) in the limit of large anisotropy , we can approximate the quasiparticle orbits as lines on the fermi surface with constant radial angle @xmath21 and constant in - plane velocity @xmath22 .",
    "this gives an approximate derivation of the low - field ( @xmath23 ) and intermediate - field ( @xmath24 ) regions . ]",
    "to lowest order in @xmath1 we can ignore both the @xmath9-axis dispersion in the equation of motion and the closed orbits .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath25 then only depends on the angle @xmath21 between the magnetic field and the in - plane fermi velocity of an electron [ see fig .",
    "( [ approxorbits]b ) ] .",
    "so we have @xmath26 where the in - plane fermi velocity , @xmath22 , is constant here .",

    "( [ chambers ] ) , we may integrate over time and @xmath33 to give the out - of - plane conductivity expressed as an integral over the orbits , namely , @xmath34 integrating this is straightforward and yields the following magnetoconductance @xmath35    at low fields ( @xmath30 ) this gives the usual quadratic field dependence as obtained by the zener - jones expansion . however in the intermediate field regime @xmath36 the magnetoconductivity falls off as @xmath37 .",
    "this is the essential result of this paper .",
    "it arises because there is a range of cyclotron frequencies for traversing the brillouin zone .",
    "note too that the magnetoconductance becomes universal , independent of the degree of anisotropy and depending only on the in - plane properties .",
    "we can emphasize this by writing the cross - over condition in terms of the magnetic length @xmath38 , namely @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40 so the linear region is reached when approximately one flux quantum threads an area formed by the in - plane mean - free - path ( @xmath41 ) and the interplanar spacing . for a typical layered oxide ( @xmath42 )",
    "one can expect to see this regime at 10 tesla when the in - plane mean free path reaches around 500  .",
    "as discussed later , experiments  @xcite on @xmath4 provide evidence for the validity of this expression",
    ".    however , this can not be the complete story since very general arguments show that @xmath43 must go as @xmath44 at high fields@xcite .",
    "since the conductivity is the sum of the conductivities from all orbits , the high - field form can not be recovered simply by including the contribution of the closed orbits : a @xmath44 contribution from closed orbits will never dominate the @xmath37 from open orbits .",
    "the correct high field result emerges when we consider higher - order effects in @xmath1 for both the open and closed orbits in the exact solution of section  iii .",
    "we will see that the high field @xmath44 regime occurs when @xmath45 .",
    "a further reason for a more detailed treatment is that the magnetoresistance is identically zero for an ellipsoidal fermi surface with a constant @xmath46 .",
    "this is because of a cancellation between the hall and magnetoconductance .",
    "we therefore would like to verify that there is no such cancellation here .",
    "we will do this through an exact solution of the boltzmann equation in which we compute all components of the conductivity tensor and hence the magnetoresistance .",

    "we introduce a parameter which is a measure of this anisotropy @xmath54 if @xmath55 , the fermi surface is closed and the trajectory of all quasiparticles in momentum ( and real ) space follows closed loops . while the system may have an anisotropic effective mass , the qualitative features of transport will not be much modified from a typical three - dimensional metal .",

    "<S> ( here , @xmath1 characterizes the bandwidth along the unixial direction . ) in the limit of large anisotropy ( small @xmath2 ) , corresponding to a quasi - two - dimensional metal made up of weakly coupled layers , we obtain an analytic expression for the magnetoresistance valid for all magnetic fields . </S>",
