    "single emitters strongly coupled to optical resonators form a promising basis for the realization of quantum networks @xcite .",
    "experimental implementations include trapped ions @xcite , atoms @xcite , artificial superconducting qubits @xcite , and opto - mechanical devices @xcite . in these platforms ,",
    "the strong coupling between photons and emitters is utilized to coherently transfer quantum information between stationary qubits at the nodes and flying qubits acting as interconnects .",
    "a prerequisite for high - fidelity operations is the control of the coupling with the cavity mode , which implies spatial localization of the emitter at the sub - wavelength scale .",
    "this requirement is easy to fulfill for artificial atoms bound to a substrate . in ion traps the steep confinement puts relatively low requirements on cooling  @xcite , while realizations based on neutral atoms in dipole traps often require to prepare the motion close to the vibrational ground state .",
    "the latter thus call for efficient cooling techniques , which are robust and sufficiently fast to enable viable quantum technological implementations",
    ".    ground - state cooling of trapped atoms usually makes use of a narrow resonance , which allows one to selectively address transitions where scattering induces the loss of a quantum of vibration  @xcite .",
    "such resonances can be realized by choosing a suitable dipolar transition , as in sideband cooling . in raman sideband cooling or eit cooling ,",
    "narrow transitions are obtained by coherent two - photon coupling of two stable states  @xcite .",
    "one possibility to cool atoms inside a cavity is to perform raman sideband cooling there , as shown in ref .",
    "the corresponding experimental effort , however , notably increases with the number of degrees of freedom to cool .",
    "an alternative is to exploit the strong coupling at the single - photon level . in this case",
    ", the relevant narrow resonance is determined by the finite cavity lifetime  @xcite , thus implementing a form of sideband cooling even on dipolar transitions whose radiative linewidth in free space is broader than the trap frequency  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cavity plays a similar role of an additional resonance with linewidth @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "sub - doppler or even sub - recoil cooling @xcite can then be realized if the cavity linewidth @xmath1 is smaller than the trap frequency @xmath2 . for typical dipole traps",
    "this condition implies rather ` closed ' cavities ( with a small @xmath3 ) , where coupling photons in and out is relatively slow , and which are thus less suitable for fast and efficient interfaces .    in this report",
    "we experimentally characterize cooling of the vibrational motion of a trapped atom by driving a high - finesse cavity coupled to a three - level @xmath0 transition .",
    "this work was triggered by recent experimental studies of single photon eit  @xcite , where long trap lifetimes times have been observed  @xcite , indicating robust cooling in this system , and on recent theoretical studies  @xcite of cooling in this experimental setup .",
    "here , we demonstrate cavity - assisted eit cooling of an atom in a dipole trap .",
    "the scheme relies on the frequency selectivity of narrow dark resonances , thus the final temperature is not limited by the resolved sideband condition ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "moreover , we exploit the possibility to switch between eit - like cooling and cavity cooling by simply changing the detuning of one laser to compare the cooling efficiency in the different regimes , and we show that the interplay of raman and cavity resonances gives rise to novel and robust cooling regimes .",
    "we show that theoretical predictions and experimental results are in remarkable agreement .",
    "in our experiment , fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](a ) , single laser - cooled neutral cesium atoms are loaded from a magneto - optical trap ( mot , @xmath5 nm ) into a far - red - detuned standing - wave dipole trap ( dt , @xmath6 nm ) with an axial trap frequency of @xmath7mhz along the @xmath8-direction and a radial trap frequency of about @xmath9khz  . after verifying that exactly one atom has been loaded and determining its position , it is subsequently transported , using the dt as a conveyor belt , into the mode of the high - finesse optical cavity , for details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the cavity resonance frequency is stabilized using a blue - detuned lock - laser ( @xmath10 nm ) , which forms at the same time a standing - wave dipole trap along the cavity axis and thus confines the atomic motion along the @xmath11-direction with an axial trap frequency of about @xmath12mhz .",
    "the relevant electronic levels are the long - lived hyperfine ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which couple to the common excited state @xmath15 via an external control laser ( propagating along the @xmath8-direction ) and the cavity mode ( along @xmath11 ) , respectively .",
    "the control laser drives the transition @xmath16 with effective strength @xmath17mhz and variable detuning @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](b ) .",
    "the cavity field has vacuum rabi frequency @xmath19mhz at its antinodes and a detuning of @xmath20mhz from the atomic transition @xmath21 .",
    "the cavity is weakly driven by a probe laser with variable detuning @xmath22 from the transition @xmath21 .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 its detuning from the empty cavity resonance . at @xmath24",
    "the probe - laser strength @xmath25mhz corresponds to a mean intracavity photon number of @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath27 is larger than the atomic dipole and cavity field decay rates @xmath28mhz , the system is in the strong coupling regime , and for our parameters , one atom in state @xmath29 causes the cavity transmission to drop by about @xmath30 compared to the on - resonance transmission .",
    "the weak - excitation regime allows us to assume that the relevant states of the cavity field are @xmath31 with @xmath32 photons . the model for the atom",
    "is based on three levels ignoring that each hyperfine state is degenerate , which will be sufficient to qualitatively describe the experimental results . therefore , the basis of the atom - photon system consists in the states @xmath33 , which are coupled as depicted in fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](b ) .",
    "state @xmath34 , in particular , weakly couples to state @xmath35 , which in turn strongly couples to the other states .",
    "the excitation spectrum with respect to the probe laser shows that the level structure is conveniently described in terms of @xmath36 and the dressed states @xmath37 and @xmath38 , _ i.e. _ the lowest - energy excited eigenstates of the control - laser driven atom - cavity system neglecting the motion  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](c ) .",
    "these dressed states have eigenfrequencies @xmath39 with @xmath40 and are superpositions of the basis states @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . since the latter two states are radiatively unstable , a finite linewidth @xmath44 can be associated with each dressed state .",
    "a fano - like profile is observed ( inset of fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](c ) ) when the detuning @xmath45 vanishes , namely , when @xmath46 and @xmath47 are resonantly coupled in a three - stage process : in this case the system exhibits a dark state where @xmath48 is not excited .",
    "our four - level system is thus similar to the one discussed in  @xcite , whereby here one excitation is purely photonic  @xcite .",
    "an example of scattering processes leading to cooling and heating along the cavity axis is sketched in fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](c ) and ( d ) . setting the probe frequency close to a narrow resonance induces processes where a vibrational quantum can be lost by either a diffusive process associated with the mechanical effect of the flourescence photon , ( c ) , or by the mechanical force of the cavity field , ( d ) .",
    "the two kinds of processes add up giving the total cooling ( heating ) rate .",
    "the existence of dark states leads to fano resonances in the scattering rates and can be exploited to suppress diffusion and heating processes .",
    "the cooling dynamics is theoretically modeled approximating the dipole potential by a harmonic oscillator and using the rate - equation description of ref .",
    "@xcite in a one - dimensional treatment  - and @xmath8- direction can be described independently ] .",
    "the model is valid for small photon numbers @xmath49 inside the cavity and for weak mechanical coupling , characterized by a small lamb - dicke parameter @xmath50^{1/2}\\ll 1 $ ] , where @xmath51 is the atomic recoil frequency and @xmath2 is the trap frequency .",
    "the theory delivers the heating and cooling rates @xmath52 connected with photon scattering along the blue and red sideband transitions @xmath53 , respectively , along the axis of motion . for cooling along the cavity axis ( @xmath11-axis ) in the configuration of fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](a ) , the rates can be written in the form @xmath54 the first term in eq .  ,",
    "proportional to @xmath55 and identical for heating and cooling , describes the diffusion of the atomic motion due to mechanical effects of spontaneous decay , and corresponds to the process sketched in fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](c ) .",
    "the second ( third ) term stems from processes where light is scattered by the atom ( cavity ) , whereby the mechanical action is due to the jaynes - cummings coupling , fig .",
    "[ level_scheme](d ) .",
    "the exact form of the quantities @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the form of @xmath52 for cooling along other directions can be found in @xcite .    from the quantities",
    "@xmath52 the cooling rate @xmath59 and , if @xmath60 , the mean occupation number @xmath61 in the stationary ( thermal ) state at the end of cooling can be calculated  @xcite .",
    "the cooling rate @xmath62 gives the time scale at which the stationary state of motion is reached .",
    "the general behavior of the rates   is determined by the states @xmath63 : @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is strongly enhanced , whenever the probe laser is resonant with the red ( blue ) sideband of one of the dressed states , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "in particular , for @xmath68 , resolved sideband cooling at the corresponding dressed state resonance can be performed .",
    "eit - like cooling in the cavity can be observed when the resonance condition @xmath69 is fulfilled .",
    "the appearance of a dark state follows from quantum interference between the three dressed states in the excitation process of the cavity - atom system , and occurs when the ground state @xmath70 is resonantly coupled by three photons ( probe , cavity , laser ) with @xmath41 . in this case , the rates are @xmath71 with @xmath72 , whereby @xmath73 is the single atom cooperativity .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath74 is proportional to the vacuum rabi - frequency @xmath27 at an antinode of the cavity s cosinusoidal mode function of wavenumber @xmath75 with @xmath76 measuring the distance of the trap center from the antinode . for @xmath77 ,",
    "three photon resonance is found for @xmath78 , and the rates eq .",
    "take on the form of eit cooling in free space with modified rabi - frequency @xmath79/\\kappa$ ] and a modified atomic linewidth @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "hence , due the cavity - boosted rabi - frequency , lower temperatures compared to free space eit cooling are possible .",
    "similarly , for large @xmath81 ( and around @xmath82 ) , one recovers normal eit - cooling  @xcite in a standing wave , where the width of the eit resonance determines the cooling . for the parameters of the experiment",
    ", this sets the limit for lowest achievable temperatures .",
    "to fully enter a regime where quantum interference involving the cavity determines the final vibrational occupation number given by @xmath83 , @xmath84 is required  @xcite , a condition not being fulfilled here .",
    "nevertheless , signatures of such a cooling scheme can be found around the range @xmath85 , as discussed below .",
    "experimentally , the cooling efficiency is characterized by means of the survival probability @xmath86 , which is measured by first trapping a single atom inside the cavity for a certain holding time @xmath87 , then retrieving it from the cavity using the conveyor belt and finally detecting its presence by the mot fluorescence .",
    "after many repetitions , the measured @xmath86 is given by the ratio between final and initial number of atoms .",
    "radiative cooling and heating effects become obvious when we compare @xmath86 with the value for atoms in the absence of near - resonant light : in the presence of the far - detuned trapping lasers only ( dt and lock laser ) , @xmath86 decays exponentially with a time constant of about @xmath88ms , limited by parametric heating @xcite due to technical intensity fluctuations mainly of the intracavity lock laser power .",
    "we compare the survival probability with the theoretical predictions for the cooling rate @xmath89 , determining the time scale at which the average number of vibrational excitation along the cavity axis exponentially approaches the stationary value @xcite .",
    "figure  [ wide_range](a ) displays a two - dimensional plot of @xmath62 , eq .  , using the rates from eq .  . here , the detunings @xmath90 and @xmath18 are varied and @xmath91 is at the fixed experimental value .",
    "large cooling rates are predicted mostly when the probe laser is tuned to the red side of a dressed - state resonance ( shaded areas ) .",

    "the cooling regions are denoted by and . in",

    "moreover , cooling is found in a second diagonal stripe , where @xmath102 , and in two regions above and below the stripes where @xmath103 .",
    "+    we experimentally verify this behavior by scanning the probe - cavity detuning @xmath90 over @xmath104mhz ( i.e. , a few @xmath105 ) around @xmath24 for different values of @xmath106 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ narrow_range](b ) : cooling is found around @xmath82 . it is also found when the probe laser is resonant or red - detuned from the cavity frequency ( @xmath107 ) and , at the same time , @xmath108 .",

    "this is also visible in fig .",
    "[ narrow_range](c ) , where the survival probability as a function of @xmath106 is displayed @xcite .",
    "these observations can be understood if we consider that the lifetime of atoms exposed to the lock laser potential is much shorter than the holding time , hence the atoms only survive if they are cooled along the cavity direction and not heated along the control laser axis .",
    "the model predicts heating along this orthogonal axis for @xmath110 , which is maximum for @xmath111 , see red shading in fig .",
    "[ narrow_range](a ) .",
    "this can explain the atom losses in this regime and why we see a single cooling peak at @xmath82 only , corresponding to the upper diagonal stripe .",
    "this stripe corresponds to the eit condition , where cooling is modified due to the presence of the cavity , and which is relevant at the level of a single photon already .",
    "interference in the processes of scattering involving the cavity manifests itself by the alternating heating and cooling regions around the eit stripe and the variation of the cooling rate along the stripe , which , for example , would allow to efficiently suppress heating transitions if the cavity sidebands were resolved .",
    "we denote the mechanism by cavity - assisted eit ( ceit ) cooling .",
    "the cooling at @xmath107 , instead , is based on the excitation of the red sideband of the cavity - like dressed state @xmath112 @xcite . here , in the limit of large @xmath113 , the control laser acts like an incoherent repumper that transfers atoms that decay into state @xmath114 back to state @xmath115 and the system can be treated as an effective two - level system @xcite .",
    "+    in order to clarify the role of the cavity in ceit cooling , we compare the observed dynamics with eit cooling in free space . for this purpose",
    "we measure the survival probability with small ensembles of atoms trapped in the standing - wave dipole trap outside the cavity ( at the position of the mot ) . here , the probe laser ( @xmath116mhz ) is directly shone on the atoms , which are strongly confined only along the control - laser axis .",
    "the holding time of @xmath117ms is much shorter than the trap lifetime of several seconds .",
    "the atoms only survive within a narrow region around @xmath82 ( eit condition ) , see the central plot of fig .",
    "[ narrow_range](b ) .    to quantify the cooling performance of eit - cooling in the dipole trap and to compare it with standard molasses - cooling ,",
    "we apply microwave sideband spectroscopy by making the lattice slightly state - dependent @xcite .",
    "[ mw_spectra ] shows spectra taken with eit- and molasses - cooled atoms , respectively .",
    "the significant reduction of the @xmath118 and @xmath119 sideband transitions compared to the @xmath120 transition indicates already a high population of the ground state of axial motion ( along @xmath8 ) for the eit- cooled atoms . performing robust adiabatic passages on the @xmath118 transition , we infer , for the eit-(molasses-)cooled atoms , a steady - state temperature of @xmath121k ( @xmath122k ) , corresponding to a final ground state occupation of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) , respectively . from the variation of the duration of the eit - cooling",
    ", a cooling rate of about @xmath9khz has been inferred , compatible with predictions in ref .",
    "with our setup we have successfully demonstrated eit - cooling applied to neutral atoms in a dipole trap . when comparing the measurement of the survival probability with the corresponding one in presence of the resonator , there is an obvious difference on the red side ( @xmath108 ) of the eit condition .",
    "this is because the cavity adds a new resonance , extending the cooling region to a larger range of probe - cavity detunings @xmath90 , thereby making the cooling more robust .",
    "for this reason , these dynamics are also suitable for simultaneously cooling several degrees of freedom , like for instance atomic arrays  @xcite . moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ narrow_range](b ) , in ceit different cooling profiles can be achieved by changing @xmath125 , reflecting the additional interference effect and resonance which are absent in free space .    in conclusion",
    ", this work investigates the new scheme of cavity assisted eit cooling and provides a comparison between the efficiency of free - space cooling and cavity cooling .",
    "these techniques can be extended for cooling optomechanical systems   coupled to a single emitter  @xcite .",
