    "most of the @xmath2 exoplanets found to date have been discovered using the doppler technique , which measures the reflex motion of the host star induced by the planets @xcite .",

    "also , many of the planets seem to move in orbits with eccentricies significantly larger than those observed in the solar system ( where @xmath3 , except for mercury which has @xmath4 ) , this result poses a problem for the planet formation theories of core accretion @xcite and disk instability @xcite , since both predict that planets form in quasi ",
    "circular orbits .",
    "the current explanation is that large eccentricities are triggered by secular interactions , i.e. the _ kozai effect _",

    "the true distribution of exoplanet eccentricities is therefore key to understand the formation of planetary systems @xcite .    about @xmath5% of the planets detected to date",

    "currently we know of three planets in that system with masses between 0.69 and 3.95 @xmath7 and orbital periods between 4.6 and 1275 days .",
    "the second multi - planet system discovery was around the m dwarf gliese 876 @xcite . in that case , the first detected planet ( gl 876b , with msini = 1.935 @xmath8 and p = 60.94 days ) , was the one orbiting furthest from the star",
    ". a better sampling of the doppler curve led to the subsequent discovery of the other two planets , gl 876c , a 0.56 @xmath8 planet orbiting with a period of 30.1 days and gl 876d , a closer - in 0.018 @xmath8 planet with a period of only 1.94 days .",
    "gl 876b and c , in particular , are in 2:1 resonance @xcite .",
    "interestingly , multi - planet systems are usually first detected as a single planet in a significanly eccentric orbit .",
    "then , every time an additional planet is found , the eccentricities of the already known planets tend to decrease .",
    "this is because spurious harmonics due to random noise and uneven sampling are absorbed at half of the period of the detected planet when an eccentric solution is forced ( see * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : math ] introduces an observational bias towards eccentric solutions . in the forthcoming sections we show how this bias can have important implications for the known sample of extrasolar planets ,",
    "that is , a significant fraction of the reported eccentric planets may in fact be multiple systems in nearly circular orbits , and several very low mass planets might have been already detected , but their effect on the star has been misinterpreted as an orbital eccentricity of an outer more massive planet .",
    "the solution degeneracy between a single planet eccentric orbit and two planets in circular resonant orbits is a direct consequence of the well known fourier expansion of the kepler equation into powers of the eccentricity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* as an example ) . in @xcite , the method of frequency analysis",
    "was first applied to an extrasolar planetary system and @xcite adapted it to doppler measurements .",
    "the potential confusion between eccentric orbits and resonant systems has been briefly mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , but this issue has not been specifically considered until now in a broad statistical sense .    mathematically , the degeneracy between the resonant and the eccentric solutions comes from the fact that their equations of keplerian trajectories are identical up to first order in the eccentricity .",
    "detailed analytical expressions in terms of the bessel functions can be found elsewhere ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the relevant terms up to the 7th power in the eccentricity can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we only discuss the first order term , which is the one relevant to the degeneracy under discussion    in the case of a single eccentric planet , the reflex radial velocity motion of the star is @xmath12 \\ ,   \\label{eq : velecc } \\\\        & + &   ke\\cos \\left [ 2 w\\left(t-\\tau_0\\right ) - \\omega\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & o({ke^2})\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the linear radial velocity of the barycenter of the system , @xmath14 is the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity variations induced by the planet on the star , @xmath15 is the argument of the periastron ( angle between the periastron of the orbit and the ascending node ) , @xmath16 is the time of crossing of the ascending node , and @xmath17 is the orbital frequency , where @xmath18 is the orbital period ( see fig .",

    "let us remark again that the only strong nonlinearity lies on the period , so the fitting of the linear parameters can be done very efficiently and without danger of ending in a local minimum , a problem which plagues more direct attack methods .",

    "the black points are the undecided ones , this is , where the first eccentric harmonic is clearly significant ( circular solution discarded ) but the statistics are insufficient to decide which solution is significantly better ( eccentric vs resonant ) .    a word of caution has to be made here .",
    "the @xmath55 are obtained using the nominal uncertainities published with the doppler data .",
    "it is well established that most of the stars introduce additional noise of astrophysical origin , that is usually called _",

    "not considering the noise due to the stellar jitter tends to give over - optimistic false alarm probabilities .",
    "this is the reason why we use the rms of the solution rather than the published uncertainties to generate synthetic data . in many cases ,",
    "the current radial velocity data sets are sparsely sampled , and more intensive monitoring at the most sensitive phases is required ( see sec .  [ breaking : rvs ] ) , especially for those systems above the @xmath70 line of fig.[fig : evske2 ] and marked on tab .",

    "a circular orbit means that the first eccentric harmonic proportional to @xmath19 is already too small to be detected , so @xmath72 is not given .",

    "this point is discussed again in section [ sec : dynamics ] .",
    "our results considering the sample of 163 planets plus the 13 very eccentric ones in table [ tab : super ] are shown in table [ tab : results ] . when the solution is clearly non - circular , our data processing approach is unable to determine which solution is favoured in @xmath75 of the cases , which clearly proves the extent of the degeneracy .",
    "the statistical behaviour of the sample is in good agreement with the predicted degeneracy threshold at @xmath68 .",
    "this gives us confidence in our data analysis scheme and the method we propose to evaluate the statistical significance of each solution using monte carlo generated false alarm probabilities .",
    "a few systems with already known resonant configurations which have gone to the process of : detect one eccentric planet and later discovery of a second planet in a 2:1 configuration ; are not considered in these counting ( eg .",

    "a detailed analysis of our best resonant candidate system hd 125612 , is discussed here to illustrate the procedure of evaluating the false alarm probability in more detail .",

    "the m4v is at a minimum distance of @xmath76 from hd 125612a and has negligible effects on the doppler data during the time span of the observations .",
    "the star is relatively quiet , so the expected jitter is of the order of @xmath77 m / s .",
    "f07 already pointed out an unexpectadly large rms and @xmath78 , indicating the presence of additional bodies in the system .",
    "we find that a resonant solution clearly improves the quality of purely keplerian fit fig .",

    "data points are available , we agree with f07 that more data is required to disentangle the true nature of this system .",
    "to quantify how sigificant is the resonant solution with respect to the eccentric one , we compute the empirical false alarm probability as described in the previous section . for this experiment , we use the square root of the reduced @xmath54 , ( i.e. @xmath78 ) to enable direct comparison with f07 .",
    "@xmath78 differs from @xmath55 used in section [ sec : analysis ] by a constant multiplicative factor which is not relevant for the fap estimations because the number of free parameters in the our resonant model is equal to the number of parameters of a single planet keplerian solution . in this case",
    "we use the published uncertainities and the a nominal stellar jitter of @xmath77 m / s to weight each observation and compute the @xmath78 .",
    "since the fap is very small , we produce one million monte carlo realizations of the data .",
    "the histogram of the obtained @xmath78 is shown in fig.[fig : mc ] . in 350 out of one million cases ,",
    "the resonant solution gives a better @xmath78 than our best fit @xmath86 , obtaining a false alarm probability of @xmath87 .",
    "we perform the same experiment but assuming an exact resonant orbit , adding noise , and fitting a keplerian orbit for another set of one million mc realizations . in this case , the monte carlo generated distribution of the @xmath78 peaks at @xmath88 very close to the @xmath78 published in f07 .",
    "this indicates that the obtained @xmath89 by f07 is compatible with the confusion of a resonant system with an eccentric planet .",
    "we have repeated the experiment introducing different levels noise ( form the nominal @xmath77 m / s to @xmath90 m / s ) , obtaining very small fap in all cases .",
    "therefore , we find strong statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that hd 125612 has a pair of planets in the 2:1 resonance instead of a single eccentric planet .",
    "it clearly exemplifies how the degeneracy under discussion and how the natural bias to the eccentric orbital solutions can be affecting a good number of exoplanet discoveries .",
    "finally , the dynamical stability of the system has been checked by numerical orbital integrations up to 1 myrs using mercury @xcite .",
    "the integration of hd 125612 shows that the candidate resonant planets would be in a strongly interacting regime where one of the resonant critical arguments circulates and the other one has a large libration amplitude .",
    "however , the system remained stable and no close encounters occurred . since the orbital solution is poorly constrained , more data is required to further constrain the orbital parameters and ensure the long term stability of the system .",
    "the resulting doppler signal as a function of time is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hd125612 ] . in the figure",
    ", it can be seen that the dynamincal interactions between planets will have obvious effects on the doppler signal in time - scales as short as a few orbital periods ( @xmath91 years ) .",
    "a small linear trend is required to obtain a good fit of the data ( in both keplerian and resonant cases ) , which is too large to be explained by the newly discovered m4v companion .",
    "this indicates the presence of an additional very long period and massive planet in the system .",
    "we strongly encourage the follow - up of this system .",
    "as illustrated in the discussion of hd125612b , a question that needs to be addressed is whether the 2:1 resonant configurations in table 1 are , in general , dynamically stable .",
    "several 2:1 resonant multi - planet systems have already been found ( i.e. gj 876 , hd 82943 , hd 73526 , hd 128311 ) .",
    "dynamical stability of 2:1 resonant configurations has been also discussed by several authors .",
    "for example , @xcite show that resonant locking may arise naturally during the migration of exoplanets in the presence of a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the case where the outer planet is significantly more massive has been recently discussed in great detail by @xcite , concluding that long term stability is guaranteed and that the resonant capture during migration is particularly favoured .",
    "therefore , there is no theoretical objection to the case addressed in this paper , on the contrary , recent work strongly support the existence and stability of @xmath92 systems in 2:1 resonant configurations .",
    "eccentric _ hot neptunes _ ( @xmath93 ) , are particularly interesting since their potentially hidden companions are of a few earth - masses or less ( see table [ tab : lowmass ] ) .",
    "their small @xmath48 makes it difficult to distinguish between solutions with the current instrumental accuracies but these are excellent targets to seek out for the effects of dynamical interactions .",
    "a very tantalizing case is the 4 planet system around gj 581 @xcite where the inner body is of a few earth masses and the new published solution for the exterior planet ( gj 581d ) gives an eccentricity of @xmath94 .",
    "a resonant planet hidden in the eccentric solution of gj 581d would perfectly fill the current gap between the 12 day orbit of gj 581c and 66 day orbit of gj 581d",
    ". the potential candidate would be of a few earth masses ( @xmath95 ) and would lie in the middle of the habitable zone .",
    "recent dynamical studies @xcite considering all the planets except the small inner one , strongly support the stability of the system when adding a few earth - mass planet in a fairly broad range of orbital configurations around the 2:1 resonance with gj 581d .",
    "since the inner planet is very small and in a very tight orbit , the authors do not expect these results will change too much .",
    "given the rms for gj 581(@xmath96 m / s ) , an amplitude of the second harmonic for gj 581d of @xmath94 m / s and ignoring the dynamical interactions , the number of observations required to reach a @xmath71 of @xmath70 and disentagle the degeneracy is @xmath97 .",
    "compared to the current @xmath98 observations , this number could be achieved in near future .",
    "the question now becomes on how to observationally identify _",
    "eccentric imposters_. we focus here on the doppler and photometric methods , which are the only two techiques with currently enough sensitivity to discern between both cases . in the future",
    ", techniques such as astrometry and direct imaging will be useful as well .      as discussed in previous sections ,",
    "the most direct approach is to increase the number of radial velocity observations , @xmath67 , and their precision @xmath99 , until the condition @xmath100 is satisfied .",
    "it is important to recall that the actual limit in pushing the accuracy @xmath99 is currently put by stellar jitter that and can be of the order of @xmath101 even for relatively quiet stars .",
    "we suspect that some of the undecided solutions in fig [ fig : evske2 ] over the critical line of @xmath70 are most likely dominated by stellar jitter or poorly sampled making still undecidible which solution is favoured .",
    "the phase of maximal difference will depend on each particular combination of orbital parameters and has to be examined case by case by direct inspection of the best keplerian solution compared to the best resonant one by subtracting both fitted models . as a general rule , the differences will be more obvious near the quadratures of the resonant solution , that is , around the extremes of the doppler curve and at the quadratures of the inner candidate seen as little bumps on the resonant signal ( dashed line ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : resvsecc ] .",
    "this strategy works better when the initial one  planet fit suggests a relatively large eccentricity @xmath9 and a poor initial fit .",
    "an example of this situation was the discovery of the planetary system around gj 876 .",
    "that system was initially confused with a single planet @xcite in an @xmath102 orbit .",
    "additional observations revealed a system of two resonant planets with smaller eccentricities and in a strong interaction regime @xcite .",
    "further observations and detailed numerical integration of the n - body problem by @xcite confirmed the presence of the two massive eccentric bodies and uncovered an additional very short period companion @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of planets in a strongly interacting regime ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : hd125612 ] ) , the numerical integration of the orbits provides a powerful discrimination method and can be used to predict the timescale required to observe the dynamical effects which should be observed in the case of a resonant configuration .",
    "a second approach is to use photometric observations .",
    "these can confirm or discard the presence of a second planet in some circumstances , either by detection of planetary transits and occultations , or by observing reflected light or thermal emission from the planets .",
    "photometric methods are mostly efficient for planets in short period orbits , since those tend to be hot and have a higher probability of transiting in front of their star . assuming that the period @xmath18 , the eccentricity @xmath34 , and @xmath16 are known from the doppler solution and that the orbital inclination of the planet is close to @xmath103 ( edge on ) , the predicted instant of transit @xmath104 depends on the eccentricity as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the number of integer periods elapsed from @xmath16 .",
    "if the system contains a hidden companion , then the true @xmath34 will be small and the transit will occur almost exactly @xmath107p after crossing the line of nodes .",
    "this test is only significant if @xmath16 is well constrained .",
    "an unambiguous determination of the eccentricity is obtained when both the primary transit and the occultation ( planet passes behind the star ) , can be observed .",
    "this is because the time interval between these two events is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "if the orbit is circular , the occultation occurs half period after the transit . if the orbit of the planet is truly eccentric , the time difference between the transit @xmath104 and the occultation @xmath108 is @xmath109 which can be as large as several hours on some of the known transiting planets .    a representative example where the observation of transits brakes the degeneracy is gj 436 .",
    "the star hosts a hot  neptune in an eccentric orbit ( @xmath110 ) with a period of only @xmath111 days @xcite .",
    "the potential hidden companion would have a mass as low as @xmath112 .",
    "gj 436b was recently found to transit @xcite , but because of the uncertainity in @xmath16 , the detection of the primary transit alone was not sufficient to confirm the eccentric orbit .",
    "shortly after , the occultation was observed in thermal emission with the _ spitzer _ telescope at the instant predicted by an eccentric solution @xcite .",
    "if the orbit of gj 436b had been circular , the time of the occultation would differ by three hours from the observed time and would not be detected with the spitzer observations .",
    "we show that the doppler signal of a single eccentric planet can mimic the signal of a two - planet system in a 2:1 circular or near  circular resonant orbit .",
    "this degeneracy is affecting a large fraction of the known exoplanets , this is , around @xmath113 of the published single planet sytems .",
    "we also find strong evidence of at least one case ( hd 125612 ) where the resonant solutions is significantly better than the published eccentric one by @xcite .",
    "the analysis described in this paper can also be applied to multi - planet systems with eccentric candidates , where the degree of degeneracy is expected to be similar or even stronger due to the mixed signals of the different planets involved .",
    "the detailed analysis of multiplanetary systems is more complex and usually involves dynamical stability consideration .",
    "therefore , a case by case study is imposed .",
    "a remarkable example is the planetary system around gj 581 @xcite were @xmath114 earth mass planet could be hidden in the habitable zone of the system .",
    "the only techniques currently able to distinguish between two resonant planets and single eccentric planet systems are limited to the doppler and photometric approaches described above . in the future ,",
    "other methods such as astrometry and direct imaging , will also provide ways to uncover _ eccentric imposters _ ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "astrometry will be the first one to become sensitive enough , once the upcoming space astrometric missions gaia / esa ( * ? ? ? * to be launched in 2011 ) and",
    "sim / nasa ( * ? ? ?",
    "* to be launched after 2015 ) , go on - line .",
    "high precision astrometry will be most helpful if the resonant orbits are not coplanar .",
    "otherwise , it will suffer from the same degeneracies as the doppler technique @xcite .",
    "the ultimate test will be direct imaging , which will make possible to measure whether the orbit of the detected planet is indeed eccentric .",
    "this will have to wait until spaceborne missions such as a darwin / tpf launch .",
    "the conclusions of this work make it worth reconsidering some published orbital solutions and motivate the follow - up of some interesting systems .",
    "we find that future announcements of eccentric planets should be carefully tested before publication since it is relatively simple to check if there is any improvement using a resonant configuration .",
    "also , we find that several reported radial velocity curves @xcite may contain hidden signals of rocky planets .    _ acknowledgements .",

    "<S> the doppler technique measures the reflex radial motion of a star induced by the presence of companions and is the most successful method to detect exoplanets . if several planets are present , their signals will appear combined in the radial motion of the star , leading to potential misinterpretations of the data . specifically , </S>",
    "<S> two planets in 2:1 resonant orbits can mimic the signal of a single planet in an eccentric orbit . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the implications of this statistical degeneracy for a representative sample of the reported single exoplanets with available datasets , finding that 1 ) around @xmath0 percent of the published eccentric one - planet solutions are statistically indistinguishible from planetary systems in 2:1 orbital resonance , 2 ) another @xmath1 can not be statistically distinguished from a circular orbital solution and 3 ) planets with masses comparable to earth could be hidden in known orbital solutions of eccentric super - earths and neptune mass planets . </S>"
