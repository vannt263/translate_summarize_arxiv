    "the hope is that a clear and complete understanding of the ideal transition will give us insight into the real glass transition that is observed in the laboratory . among these efforts to study the ideal glass transition ,",

    ", the increase of @xmath40 increases the transition in a linear fashion . from eq .",
    "[ e_alpha ] it is easy to see the negative value of @xmath40 competes with negative @xmath26 .",
    "the negative @xmath26 prefers different states of the nearest spins and consequently the same states of the spins on surface diagonal , while negative @xmath40 forces the diagonal spins to be in different states .",
    "thus , in both the crl and the husimi lattice the decrease of @xmath40 decreases the transition temperature , that is , makes it easier for the system to be melted . on the other hand ,",
    "positive @xmath40 favors antiferromagnetic spin configuration and increase the transition temperature for the same reason . in crl ,",
    "the role of @xmath40 is more significant than it is in the husimi lattice , because a cubic unit has 12 surface diagonal interactions and 12 nearest interactions , while a square unit has 4 @xmath26 s and 2 @xmath40 s therefore the diagonal interactions have less weight .",
    "an important feature of @xmath41 is that its sign ( positive or negative ) does not affect the solutions . with the increase of @xmath41 , the transition temperature decrease although by a very small amount in crl , and much smaller in the husimi lattice .",
    "that is because the three - spins interactions would disturb the ordered state formation ; nevertheless its contribution is very small in the total energy in both cases .",
    "another interesting effect of @xmath41 is that , although the transition temperature change weakly with @xmath41 , it changes the thermodynamic curves dramatically , and with @xmath149 it could even destroy the ideal glass transition by having the supercooled liquid continue to zero temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "the roles of four - spins interaction @xmath42 in crl and the husimi lattice are very different . in the crl , there are six squares in one cubic unit .",
    "the value of @xmath42 affects the spins states the same way as @xmath40 , i.e. it increases the transition temperature .",
    "however it does not change @xmath131 and @xmath130 in the husimi lattice because the 4-spins interaction is mainly the interaction of a whole unit , thus its effect is like a magnetic field @xmath15 for each single spin .",
    "the ising model on a recursive lattice enables us to do exact calculations without any approximation to study the supercooled liquid , the crystal formation and phase transitions .",
    "we have constructed a multi - branched 2d husimi lattice to represent a model with higher dimension and a cubic recursive lattice of the same coordination number to simulate a 3d system .",
    "the branch number is set to be 3 in the multi - branched 2d husimi lattice to make the coordination number to be 6 .",
    "becuase of the same coordination number , both lattice are designed to approximate regular 3d lattice .",
    "we applied the antiferromagnetic ising model on the two lattices and the alternative spin arrangement to represent the ordered phase i.e. crystal state , whereas the homogeneous spins arrangement represents the metastable state , i.e.  the liquid and the supercooled liquid states .",
    "a set of solutions relating to the probability that one site being occupied by a particular spin state can be exactly calculated on the lattice from the ratio of partial partition functions .",
    "then the thermal properties of the two models were calculated from the solutions and compared with each other . two kinds of solutions , 2-cycle and 1-cycle solutions , representing the ordered and disordered states respectively , give the thermodynamics of crystal and metastable states .",
    "the behavior of the free energy and the entropy of two states allows us to locate the melting transition at @xmath131 and the kauzmann temperature @xmath130 .",
    "the @xmath131 is determined by the differing of two states with temperature decreasing , above that temperature two solutions have the same disordered behavior as liquid .",
    "when the system goes below the @xmath131 an ordered state ( from 2-cycle solution ) appears with lower free energy and entropy , while the disordered solution ( 1-cycle solution ) still exists and the system is possible to continue in supercooled state without phase transition .",
    "the entropy of this disordered state will gradually decrease to zero and then negative at a non - zero temperature , which is determined to be the ideal glass transition temperature , or kauzmann temperature @xmath130 .",
    "the transition temperatures determined on both lattices are very close to each other , and fairly agrees with the results from other methods such as mc simulation and series analysis .",
    "the results confirms our expectation that 1 ) crl is a good approximation of regular 3d cubic lattice , and 2 ) with the same coordination number the multi - branched husimi lattice is also capable to describe systems in higher dimension .",
    "in addition to the nearest neighbor interactions , the effects of second nearest neighbor interaction , interaction between triplets and quadruplet are studied in this work .",
    "all their effects are similar for the two lattices except @xmath42 .",
    "this enables us to obtain expected transition temperature or thermodynamic behaviors by adjusting the interaction parameters for an extensive use of our models .",
    "we conclude that the 3-branched husimi lattice provides a less versatile and accurate method compared to crl .",
    "for example , the latter provides a transition temperature closer to that obtained by series analysis than the one obtained by the husimi lattice .",
    "however , the multi - branched husimi lattice calculation is simpler and less time - consuming , which still prove very helpful in applications ."
