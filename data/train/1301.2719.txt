    "while strong electron - electron interactions are an integral element of such nanodevices , experiments on single - molecule transistors@xcite and quantum - dot cavities@xcite have also highlighted the importance of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the main aspects of the last two experiments appear to be captured by variants of the anderson - holstein model , which supplements the anderson model@xcite for a magnetic impurity in a metallic host with a holstein coupling@xcite of the impurity charge to a local bosonic mode , usually assumed to represent an optical phonon .",
    "the model has been studied since the 1970s in connection with the mixed - valence problem,@xcite the role of negative-@xmath1 centers in superconductors,@xcite and most recently , single - molecule devices.@xcite various analytical approximations as well as nonperturbative numerical renormalization - group calculations have shown that the holstein coupling reduces the coulomb repulsion between two electrons in the impurity level , even yielding effective electron - electron attraction for sufficiently strong impurity - boson coupling .",
    "furthermore , for the full anderson - holstein model with nonzero hybridization , as the impurity - boson coupling increases from zero , there can be a crossover from a conventional kondo effect , involving conduction - band screening of the impurity spin degree of freedom , to a `` charge kondo effect '' in which it is the impurity `` isospin '' or deviation from half - filling that is quenched by the conduction band .",
    "however , the evolution between these limits is entirely smooth , and the model exhibits no qpt .",
    "this paper reports the results of study of a pseudogap anderson - holstein model which incorporates the structured conduction - band density of states from the pseudogap anderson model into the anderson - holstein model .",
    "the essential physics of the problem , revealed using a combination of poor - man s scaling and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , is shown to depend on the sign of the effective coulomb interaction between two electrons in the impurity level , on the presence or absence of particle - hole ( charge - conjugation ) symmetry and time - reversal symmetry , and on the value of the exponent @xmath2 characterizing the variation @xmath3 of the density of states near the fermi energy @xmath4 .",
    "even though the pseudogap anderson - holstein hamiltonian has a lower symmetry than the pseudogap anderson hamiltonian , the universal properties of the former model , including the structure of the renormalization - group fixed points and the values of critical exponents describing properties in the vicinity of those fixed points , are identical to those of the latter model as generalized to allow for negative ( attractive ) as well as positive values of the local interaction @xmath1 between two electrons in the impurity level.@xcite the pseudogap anderson - holstein model can therefore be regarded in part as providing a physically plausible route to accessing the negative-@xmath1 regime of the pseudogap anderson model .",
