    "the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) matter in three dimensions , i.e. , the temperature , the baryon chemical potential , and the isospin , is the holy grail of nuclear physics .",
    "so far great efforts have been made in understanding the qcd phase diagram at nearly zero isospin .",
    "for instance , the transition from the produced quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to hadronic matter at the top energy of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) or at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a smooth crossover at nearly zero baryon and isospin chemical potential based on lattice qcd ( lqcd ) studies  @xcite .",
    "although lqcd suffers from the fermion sign problem  @xcite at finite baryon chemical potential , the hadron - quark phase transition can be a first - order one at large baryon chemical potentials based on studies from phenomenological theoretical models , e.g. , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model and its extensions  @xcite . to further explore the qcd phase structure and",
    "search for the signal of the critical point between the crossover and the first - order transition , experimental programs such as the beam - energy scan ( bes ) at rhic and the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) at facilities for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) were proposed . however , using neutron - rich heavy - ion beams , the isospin degree of freedom is expected to be increasingly important at lower collision energies with larger net baryon densities .",
    "the different interactions for @xmath0 quark and @xmath1 quark in baryon - rich isospin asymmetric quark matter consisting of different net numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks can lead to isospin - dependent dynamics in the qgp .",
    "in addition , the phase boundary as well as the critical point extracted from these experiments are actually those at finite isospin in the 3-dimensional qcd phase diagram , since the whole system is a globally neutron - rich or @xmath1-quark - rich one .",
    "the isospin physics has been in fact a hot topic in low - energy nuclear physics as well as nuclear astrophysics in the past 15 years , and the nuclear symmetry energy , the energy excess for neutron - rich system comparing with isospin symmetric one , is important in understanding various phenomena in finite nuclei , nuclear reactions , and compact stars  @xcite .",
    "generally , a larger symmetry energy leads to a repulsive ( attractive ) potential for particles with negative ( positive ) isospin , and a stiffer equation of state ( eos ) for isospin asymmetric matter . besides the interesting isospin dynamics at rhic - bes and fair - cbm and isospin dependent qcd phase diagram mentioned above , the quark matter symmetry energy , the eos of the isospin asymmetric quark matter , and their temperature dependence are also interesting topics .",
    "the eos of hot quark matter is the main ingredient for hydrodynamic calculation of the qgp evolution , while that of cold quark matter is important in understanding the properties of quark stars or hybrid stars , which is probably related to the recently observed massive compact stars , e.g. , psr j1614 - 2230 with @xmath2",

    "quark matter , we break the su(3 ) symmetry of the 3-flavor njl lagrangian by introducing the scalar - isovector and vector - isovector couplings  @xcite , corresponding to different extent of isospin symmetry breaking in the scalar and vector channels .",
    "we will see that the isospin vector couplings may have dramatic effects on the isospin dependence of the qcd phase diagram at large isospin chemical potential as well as the quark matter symmetry energy .",

    "again , the isospin splittings are more considerable from the scalar - strangeness coupling than from the vector - strangeness coupling , consistent with our findings in the previous sections .",

    "again , the symmetry energy is reduced in the presence of strange quarks as found in sec .",
    "the eos of isospin asymmetric quark matter is related to the quark matter symmetry energy , and it is found that the vector - strangeness coupling has little effect on the hybrid star results discussed above while the scalar - strangeness coupling slightly reduces the maximum mass of hybrid stars .",
    "in this work , we have studied the properties of isospin asymmetric quark matter based on the 3-flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model as well as its polyakov - loop extension with scalar - isovector and vector - isovector couplings .",

    "the separation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark chiral phase transition is observed with positive isovector coupling constants but is suppressed with negative ones .",
    "the quark matter symmetry energy is shown to decrease with increasing isovector coupling constant , and is mostly enhanced with polyakov - loop extension .",
    "we found that the isospin splittings of quark condensate , constituent quark mass , and chiral phase transition as well as the critical point are more sensitive to the scalar - isovector coupling , while the quark matter symmetry energy is more sensitive to the vector - isovector coupling .",
    "a positive scalar - isovector coupling constant can lead to an unstable isospin asymmetric quark matter and hybrid star matter .",
    "the particle fraction as well as the equation of state in hybrid stars depends on the isovector couplings as well .",
    "possible effects on the above results from further breaking of the strangeness sector among the flavor symmetry have also been discussed .    at rhic - bes or fair - cbm energies , the isospin splitting of final hadron observables",
    "is expected to be sensitive to the isospin dynamics of the produced quark matter . in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , by comparing the experimental results of such splitting with those from transport model simulations based on the njl lagrangian used in the present work , one can in principle extract useful information of the isospin dependence of the qcd phase diagram and constrain the quark matter symmetry energy .",
