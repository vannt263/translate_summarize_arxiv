    "the study of spin - orbit ( so ) effects in semiconductor nanostructures has been the object of many experimental and theoretical investigations in the last few years , see e.g. refs . and refs . therein . in spite of this , the extraction from measurements of the effective spin - orbit coupling constant of both dresselhaus@xcite and bychkov - rashba@xcite so interactions is not a simple matter , since the so corrections to the electron energy spectrum in a magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) are vanishingly small because they correspond to second order effects in perturbation theory .",
