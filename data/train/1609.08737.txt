    "often , phase i trials in diseases like cancer , osteoarthritis , and psoriasis aim to find the maximum tolerated dose ( mtd ) , the highest dose with toxicity rate lower than or close to a pre - specified target level , @xmath0 . as in most statistical inference",
    ", an estimated mtd is usually produced to represent the true and unknown mtd .",
    "however , the  estimation is always with noise and the probability of toxicity for the estimated mtd is never exactly the same as @xmath0 . for this reason",
    ", the statistical community has been considering interval - based inference to account for the variabilities in the toxicity estimates .",
    "for example , @xcite propose to treat any dose with toxicity probability in the `` indifference interval '' @xmath1 as an estimated mtd , as long as a small @xmath2 is agreed upon at the design stage by the clinical team .",
    "later , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors further developed toxicity probability interval ( tpi ) and modified tpi ( mtpi ) methods , in which they formally proposed a decision theoretic framework linking the dose - finding decisions of `` stay '' ( s ) , `` de - escalation '' ( d ) , and `` escalation '' ( e ) with the equivalence interval @xmath3 , over - dosing interval @xmath4 , and under - dosing interval @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "for a given dose @xmath6 , the authors calculate @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , three posterior probabilities that the toxicity rate @xmath10 belongs to each of the three dosing intervals .",
    "the authors associate the dose - finding decisions with these three posterior probabilities .",
    "distinctively , inference in mtpi is directly linked to the posterior probabilities of the three dosing intervals , which is different from a class of other interval designs @xcite that use a point estimate @xmath11 and compare @xmath11 with three dosing intervals .",
    "that is , these interval designs do not directly calculate posterior probabilities of the intervals .",
    "they use the intervals as a thresholding device where their inference is still based on a point estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "interval - based designs , such as mtpi @xcite are based on parametric models and use model - based inference for decision making . in @xcite and @xcite the superiority of the interval - based designs over the standard rule - based designs , such as the 3 + 3 design is established using massive simulations and crowd sourcing .",
    "one critical and distinctive feature of mtpi is its ability to precalculate all the dose finding decisions in advance , allowing investigators to examine the decisions before the trial starts .",
    "therefore , even though a model - based design , mtpi exhibits the same simplicity and transparency as rule - based methods .",
    "however , some decision rules in mtpi could be debated in practice .",
    "for example , when the target toxicity probability @xmath12 , and 3 out of 6 patients treated at a dose experience dose limiting toxicity ( dlt ) events , mtpi would suggest `` s '' , stay at the current dose and enroll more patients to be treated at the dose . since the empirical rate is 3/6 , or 50%",
    ", practitioners have argued that the decision should be `` d '' , de - escalation instead of `` s '' .",
    "another case is when @xmath12 and 2 out of 9 patients experience dlt events at a dose , mtpi would suggest `` s '' as well .",
    "investigators could argue that the decision should be `` e '' , escalation since the empirical rate is 2/9 , or 22% .",
    "for this reason , @xcite proposed an ad - hoc remedy that allows the decision rules in the mtpi design to be modified by users .",
    "while this feature allows great flexibility in practice , it lacks solid statistical justification and therefore can not be properly assessed .    to this end",
    ", we propose mtpi-2 , an extension of mtpi that solves the undesirable issue in the current decision under mtpi .",
    "we show that the suboptimal rules listed above are consequences of the ockham s razor @xcite .",
    "the ockham s razor usually helps bayesian inference to automatically achieve parsimony by favoring simpler models .",
    "however , in the case of dose finding with small sample size , the ockham s razor is too sharp and must be blunted .",
    "otherwise , anti - intuitive decisions , such as those listed above , will be generated as a consequence of parsimonious inference under the ockham s razor . in mtpi-2",
    ", we provide a new framework to blunt the ockham s razor , which leads to an improved decision table .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to ockham s razor and its role in interval - based designs .",
    "section 3 proposes mtpi-2 as a solution to blunt the ockham s razor with a few simple theoretical results .",
    "section 4 examines the numerical performance of mtpi-2 , in comparison to the mtpi design using crowd sourcing .",
    "section 5 introduces an online software that implements both methods and section 6 ends the manuscript with a discussion .",
    "as an accepted principle in science , the ockham s razor states the principle that an explanation of the facts should be no more complicated than necessary @xcite . a direct impact of ockham s razor is on model selection , which favors `` smaller '' models if data can be fit similarly well by different models .",
    "usually , in model selection one considers multiple models @xmath13 , and for each model @xmath14 , a set of parameters @xmath15 .",
    "bayesian inference involving model selection typically requires a prior @xmath16 for the candidate model @xmath17 and a prior @xmath18 for parameters @xmath15 that characterize the parameters of interests in model @xmath14 .",
    "formal posterior inference calculates the posterior probability of the model @xmath19 and selects the model with the largest posterior probability .",
    "numerous papers have shown that the inference based on the posterior probability @xmath20 automatically applies the ockham s razor , in that models with more parameters and larger parameter space are penalized .",
    "in general , the ockham s razor helps bayesian inference by selecting more parsimonious models .",
    "however , in the case of interval - based designs for dose finding , such as mtpi , ockham s razor is too sharp and leads to practically undesirable decisions . to see this",
    ", we first conduct a quick review of the mtpi design .",
    "the mtpi design considers three intervals that partition the sample space @xmath21 for the probability of toxicity @xmath10 at a given dose @xmath6 : @xmath22 the three intervals can be viewed as three models @xmath14 with index @xmath23 , where the three letters correspond to the dose - finding decisions if they are selected .",
    "for example , when @xmath24 is selected as the winning model , the corresponding decision is `` e '' , to escalate from the current dose .",
    "typically , @xmath0 ranges from @xmath25 to @xmath26 in phase i trials , and @xmath27 s are usually small , say @xmath28 . in mtpi ,",
    "the observed data are integers @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the numbers of patients treated at dose @xmath6 and those who have experienced dlt events , respectively . given @xmath10 , the probability of toxicity at dose @xmath6 , @xmath32 a binomial distribution .",
    "the mtpi design assumes that @xmath33 , and the dose - finding decision rule for dose @xmath6 is given by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the posterior probability of the interval @xmath14 divided by the length of the interval .",
    "we first show that the decision rule @xmath36 is optimal if intervals @xmath14 are considered part of the candidate models in a model - selection framework . to see this",
    ", we introduce an additional parameter @xmath37 , which denotes the indicator of the three candidate models ( intervals ) to which @xmath10 belongs .",
    "in particular , theorem 1 below shows that decision @xmath36 corresponds to the bayes rule , the optimal decision rule that minimizes the posterior expected loss under a 0 - 1 loss function @xmath38 @xcite , defined by @xmath39 the loss function @xmath38 states that the loss for taking action @xmath17 is 0 if model @xmath14 is the winning model , and 1 otherwise .",
    "3ex    * theorem 1 . *",
    "_ given the sampling model @xmath32 and priors @xmath40 independently for all doses , and given the 0 - 1 loss function @xmath41 in for three decisions , where @xmath42 , decision rule @xmath36 in is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the posterior expected loss .",
    "_    proof is given in the appendix a. 3ex    the bayes rule @xmath36 selects the action @xmath43 corresponding to the model @xmath14 with the largest posterior probability .",
    "this inference is subject to ockham s razor . as an example , when @xmath44 and @xmath45 , i.e. , the decision rule @xmath36 boils down to comparing the @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which involves the calculation of the posterior probability @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for each model ,",
    "the size of the model is the length of the interval in the model .",
    "the model size @xmath51 is usually larger than the size @xmath52 since usually @xmath0 is close to 0.3 or 0.16 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the posterior probability @xmath48 can be written as a difference of incomplete beta functions evaluated at the boundaries of the two models .",
    "some theoretical discussion of how @xmath54 depends on @xmath31 , @xmath30 and interval definitions are given in appendix b. when @xmath55 and @xmath56 , it can be shown that the @xmath46 is larger than @xmath47 for @xmath12 and @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , even though the empirical rate @xmath58 is greater than @xmath12 , mtpi still prefers @xmath59 , to stay at the current dose . in summary , due to the ockham s razor which prefers more parsimonious model , in this case model",
    "@xmath60 with a shorter interval length , mtpi chooses to stay at dose @xmath6 when @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "theoretically , the exact proof depends on the convexity of the incomplete beta function , which is still an open question @xcite with no conclusion .",
    "instead , we provide a numerical illustration next .    as an example that shows the effect of the ockham s razor , in figure [ fig : razor - examp ] , mtpi will select decision `` s '' even when @xmath55 out of @xmath56 patients experience the dlt events , and the posterior distribution is clearly peaked inside the interval @xmath61 .     when @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "even though the shape of the density suggests that dose @xmath6 might be above the mtd , e.g. , the posterior mode is to the right of the equivalence interval ( shown as the two vertical bars ) , the upm for decision @xmath59 ( stay ) is still larger than that the upm for decision @xmath62 ( de - escalate ) .",
    "therefore , mtpi would still choose to `` stay '' despite that the shape of the posterior density of @xmath10 indicates otherwise .",
    "this is due to the larger size ( longer length ) of the interval @xmath61 than @xmath60 and the ockham s razor , which prefers the smaller model @xmath60 . ]",
    "we provide a solution to blunt the ockham s razor for mtpi and avoid the undesirable decisions , such as @xmath59 when 3 out of 6 patients experience dlt at a given dose . statistically speaking",
    ", there is nothing wrong with the current decision in mtpi as the bayesian inference takes into account the model complexity when choosing the optimal decision .",
    "however , for human clinical trials patient safety often outweighs statistical optimality . to this end , we modify the decision theoretic framework and blunt the ockham s razor",
    ".    we call the new class of designs mtpi-2 , since the framework is motivated by that in mtpi .",
    "we show next that the framework blunt the ockham s razor and leads to safer and more desirable decision rules .",
    "importantly , mtpi-2 preserves the same simple and transparent nature exhibited in mtpi , facilitating its practical implementation by both statisticians and clinicians .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the unit interval @xmath63 into subintervals with equal length , given by @xmath64 .",
    "this results in multiple intervals with the same length , which are considered multiple equal - sized models .",
    "see figure [ fig : mtpi-2 ] . for clarity , we now denote @xmath65 the equivalence interval @xmath66 , and @xmath67 a set of intervals below @xmath65 , and @xmath68 a set of intervals above @xmath65 .",
    "for example , when @xmath12 and @xmath57 , the equivalence interval is @xmath69 , the @xmath67 intervals are @xmath70 and the @xmath68 intervals are @xmath71 the same as mtpi , if the equivalence interval @xmath72 has the largest upm , it is selected as the winning model and the dose - finding decision of mtpi-2 is @xmath59 , stay .",
    "if any interval @xmath73 or @xmath74 has the largest upm , it will be selected as the winning model and the dose - finding decision is @xmath62 or @xmath75 , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : mtpi-2 ] , for the same posterior density corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , interval @xmath76 exhibits the largest upm and therefore the decision is now @xmath62 .",
    "note that the same decision theoretic framework as mtpi is in place except that now there are multiple intervals corresponding to @xmath62 or @xmath75 , and the intervals all have the same length , thereby blunting the ockham s razor .",

    "interval @xmath76 exhibits the largest upm and therefore the decision is now @xmath62 , to de - escalate . ]",
    "we again consider a 0 - 1 loss function @xmath77 , but with multiple intervals , and multiple decisions .",
    "shown in table [ tab : loss ] the loss function divides the parameter space @xmath78 of @xmath10 into @xmath79 intervals , with @xmath80 intervals below the equivalence interval @xmath81 and @xmath82 intervals above @xmath81 . except for the two boundary intervals",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 , all the intervals have the same length @xmath85 .",
    "the loss @xmath77 is a function of action @xmath86 that selects any of the @xmath87 intervals as the winning model , and the parameter @xmath88 indexes the model , which takes one of the intervals @xmath14 .",
    "there are a total of @xmath89 intervals .",
    "consider the statistical decision @xmath86 to select one interval as the winning interval into which the toxicity probability @xmath10 falls .",
    "however , selecting a winning interval must be translated into dose - finding decisions . to this end",
    ", we consider a deterministic mapping .",
    "define @xmath90 the three dose - finding decisions for the trial . based on ethical consideration ,",
    "whenever the statistical decision @xmath86 is in set @xmath67 , @xmath65 , or @xmath68 , the corresponding trial decision @xmath91 takes value @xmath75 , @xmath59 , or @xmath62 , respectively .",

    "for example , if @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the decision is @xmath62 in figure [ fig : tables](a ) , and the next patients will be treated at dose 2 . note that in contrast , figure [ fig : tables](a ) would suggest @xmath59 under mtpi , a now suboptimal decision under mtpi-2 .",
    "more discussion about figure [ fig : tables ] will follow next .",
    "the full algorithm of mtpi-2 is given below , assuming patients are enrolled in cohorts of size @xmath119",
    "as an interval design , both mtpi and mtpi-2 generate a set of decisions based on the input values @xmath0 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 from physicians .",
    "they are summarized in a tabular format , e.g. , those in figure [ fig : tables ] .",
    "together , three values define the equivalence interval @xmath66 where any dose with a toxicity probability falling into the interval can be considered as an mtd .",
    "doses with toxicity probabilities outside the interval are considered either too low or too high . in a dose - finding trial aiming at identifying the mtd",
    ", the decision table can be precalculated for any values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and a sample size which determines column number of the table .",
    "suppose a sample size @xmath124 is decided for the trial .",
    "for each enumerated integer pairs , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , the decision @xmath127 is precalculated .",
    "figures [ fig : tables ] ( a ) shows an example of the decision tables under both designs for @xmath12 and a sample size of 12 . as can be seen , the main improvement of the mtpi-2 design over mtpi is the precise and `` faithful '' decisions that reflect physicians input .",
    "for example , unlike mtpi where a decision @xmath59 is given when @xmath55 toxicity events are observed out of @xmath56 patients , mtpi-2 recommends @xmath62 , to de - escalate .",
    "similarly , when @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the decision becomes @xmath75 for mtpi-2 instead of @xmath59 for mtpi .",
    "in essence , mtpi-2 becomes a more `` nimble '' design due to the effort in blunting the ockham s razor .",
    "specifically , mtpi favors the @xmath65 and the decision @xmath59 , to stay , simply because the equivalence interval has the shortest length and is preferred in the bayesian inference due to the ockham s razor .",
    "in contrast , mtpi-2 avoids the ockham s razor by having equal - lengthed intervals .",
    "therefore , in figures [ fig : tables](a ) the mtpi-2 design shows fewer @xmath59 , more @xmath62 s and @xmath75 s .",
    "figure [ fig : tables](b ) shows the distribution of different decisions between mtpi-2 and mtpi for different @xmath0 values and a large sample size of 30 .",
    "as can be seen , all the differences are related to changing the decision @xmath59 in mtpi to not @xmath59",
    "( @xmath62 , @xmath75 , or @xmath130 ) in mtpi-2 . in general , many @xmath59 decisions are changed to @xmath62 or @xmath75 , corresponding to the green and blue bars , respectively .",
    "also , when @xmath131 , there are no green bars ( hence no change from @xmath59 to @xmath75 ) , which seems to be sensible since escalation is less likely when @xmath131 . in addition , when @xmath132 , some @xmath59 decisions are changed to @xmath130 ( red bars ) .",
    "that is , some `` stay '' decisions in mtpi are changed to a composite decision in mtpi-2 , which says that first , `` de - escalate '' and second , the current dose is deemed too toxic and will be removed from the trial .",
    "this is a major modification on the dosing decision .",
    "we look into why there is such a big change .",
    "for example , such a change occurs when @xmath133 and @xmath55 out of @xmath134 patients experience dlt . under mtpi ,",
    "the three intervals are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 . intuitively , the empirical toxicity rate equals @xmath138 , which is much higher than @xmath133 .",
    "so @xmath62 , de - escalate , should be preferred .",
    "however , based on mtpi the upm for @xmath59 is the largest .",
    "the main reason is that the posterior distribution of @xmath10 is beta(4 , 10 ) given data @xmath139 , which has a very light right tail and puts tiny probability mass when @xmath140 .",
    "this allows ockham s razor to sharply penalize the right interval @xmath137 , which is of length @xmath141 .",
    "in contrast , the ei @xmath136 only has a length of @xmath142 . as a consequence ,",
    "the upm value for each of the three intervals , defined as the ratio of interval s posterior probability mass and interval length , favors the shorter interval @xmath136 instead of @xmath137 , even though the posterior distribution puts most mass above 0.15 .",
    "therefore , mtpi gives an @xmath59 for @xmath139 .",
    "however , the mtpi-2 design blunts the ockham s razor and uses sub - intervals with equal length . based on the new statistical framework under mtpi-2 ,",
    "the winning subinterval is @xmath143 and the optimal decision is @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , under mtpi-2 the safety rule is invoked and therefore @xmath144 is added . in the case of mtpi , since the decision is @xmath59 , the safety rule is not even evaluated ( mtpi does not evaluate the safety rule unless the decision is @xmath62 ) .",
    "for these reasons , when @xmath55 and @xmath134 at a given dose @xmath6 , mtpi would stay ( @xmath59 ) and mtpi would de - escalate and remove dose @xmath6 from the trial ( due to high toxicity ) .",
    "this example shows that mtpi-2 is a safer design than mtpi .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tables](c ) we show that the changes from mtpi decisions to mtpi-2 decisions are all compatible with the empirical toxicity rate @xmath145 .",
    "that is , mtpi-2 would only change @xmath59 to @xmath75 when the empirical rate is lower than @xmath0 , and @xmath59 to @xmath62 when the empirical rate is higher than @xmath0 .",
    "due to the principled decision - theoretic framework , mtpi-2 calculates the posterior probability @xmath146 for each of the intervals , @xmath147 .",
    "naturally , the bayes factor ( bf ) between any two intervals can be calculated as @xmath148 assuming equal prior probability for each model @xmath14 .",
    "a value close to 1 means there is only weak evidence supporting one model or the other . in mtpi-2 , in addition to provide the winning decision in the table , we also display the bf of the winning decision versus the decision with the second largest posterior probability .",
    "therefore , all those bf s are greater than 1 but a value close to 1 , say @xmath149 indicates uncertainty in the decision . due to small sample sizes for phase i trials ,",

    "when @xmath156 , mtpi-2 is more reliable .",
    "what stands out is that mtpi-2 is always safer than mtpi regardless of the @xmath0 values , which means that mtpi-2 has less chance of assigning patients to overly toxic doses than mtpi . in practice , mtpi-2 and mtpi",
    "are both easy to implement , only requiring 1 ) generating dose - assignment decision tables ( e.g. , in figure [ fig : tables]a ) prior to trial initiation and 2 ) following the decisions in the table during the course of the trial .",
    "we have implemented mtpi-2 as an online tool at www.compgenome.org/ngdf .",
    "it only requires a web browser , such as google chrome , to access .",
    "the same website hosts mtpi , 3 + 3 , and a version of crm which allows head - to - head comparison between mtpi-2 and these designs .",
    "there is no need to download or maintain any software package , and the web tool can be accessed anywhere via internet . in our experience , the web tool runs successfully on a tablet such as ipad or a smart phone such as iphone .",
    "this capability allows investigators to use the design with great flexibility .",
    "a detailed user manual is provided on the website to assist new users .",
    "we present mtpi-2 , an improved mtpi design , to reduce the effect from the ockham s razor in the posterior inference .",
    "the mtpi-2 design is based on formal bayesian decision theoretic framework , adjusting for ockham s razor .",
    "it mitigates some suboptimal decisions in mtpi and provides theoretically optimal and intuitively sound decision rules . as a result",
    ", mtpi-2 makes more refined actions that allow more efficient exploration of different doses in the dose finding process .",
    "the mtpi-2 design hinges on user - provided quantities , @xmath0 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it treats any dose with toxicity probability smaller than @xmath157 or larger than @xmath158 as being lower or higher than the mtd , respectively .",
    "therefore , these two values are the key input of the design and must be elicited from physicians .",
    "for example , one can ask the physician what the highest toxicity rate is that would still warrant a dose escalation ( @xmath159 ) and the lowest rate ( @xmath160 ) that would warrant a dose de - escalation . in this paper",
    ", we consider @xmath161 .",
    "intuitively , when the two @xmath27 s are not equal , the decisions can be altered in a nonsymmetric way such as allowing more escalation than de - escalation or the opposite .",
    "this is an ongoing research direction that we are currently pursuing .",
    "we focus on the comparison between mtpi and mtpi-2 in this paper . for interested readers desired to compare mtpi-2 to the 3 + 3 design @xcite or the continual reassessment method ( crm , @xcite )",
    ", we refer to @xcite and @xcite who compared mtpi to 3 + 3 and crm through extensive simulation studies , which serves as an indirect comparison to mtpi-2 .",
    "innovatively , mtpi-2 is able to provide bayes factors for each decision so that investigators can assess the uncertainty behind it .",
    "these bayes factors may provide additional use for future work , such as allowing for randomization between two different decisions when the value of bayes factor comparing the two decisions is very close to 1 .",
    "the size of the equivalence interval serves as an `` effect size '' for phase i dose - finding trials .",
    "this is an added benefit of interval - based designs , such as mtpi and mtpi-2 .",
    "a narrower equivalence interval implies that the mtd must be identified with more precision , and therefore demands a larger sample size .",
    "also the sample size will depend on the number of doses in the trial and the cohort size , see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "we intend to address the sample size issue in a future work .",
    "it suffices to show that the decisions rule @xmath36 maximizes @xmath165 , the posterior expected utility , where utility is defined as one minus the 0 - 1 loss , i.e. , @xmath166 the posterior expected utility for action @xmath167 at dose @xmath6 is given by @xmath168 therefore , the decision rule given by @xmath169 maximizes the posterior expected utility , which is equivalent to minimizing the posterior expected 0 - 1 loss .",
    "based on @xcite , @xmath173 where @xmath174   \\right\\}^{1/2},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "when @xmath55 and @xmath45 , the incomplete beta function can be shown to be approximated by @xmath177 based on feller ( 1968 ) , this can be approximated by @xmath178 which equals @xmath179 a numerical evaluation reveals that when @xmath180 takes values at 0.25 , 0.35 , and near 1 , the expression of favors model @xmath61 in which @xmath181 and @xmath182 over model @xmath60 in which @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no general conclusion on the value of for any @xmath31 and @xmath30 values , which makes the theoretical derivation difficult .",
    "the above derivation pushes forward the theoretical development for the incomplete beta function in that it gives the ratio of @xmath185 .",
    "however , the entire function if not monotone with a mode at 0.5 , which makes it difficult to evaluate the magnitude of as a difference of two incomplete beta functions .",
    "it is known that the analytic expression of incomplete beta function is still an open research question @xcite .",
    "therefore , we leave the further theoretical development to future work ."
