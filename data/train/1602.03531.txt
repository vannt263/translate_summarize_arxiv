    "we measured expansion of the end of the ne jet using the same method as for expansion of the shell ( see   [ expansion ] for more details ) , except that here expansion is measured relative to the pulsar , and we used only high - energy ( 3.38 kev ) photons in order to avoid contamination from soft thermal emission that becomes important at low energies ( fig .",

    "long - term variations in the pulsar activity might be responsible for this contraction , or the jets might be hydrodynamically unstable .",

    "comparison of the x - ray pwn with the thermal x - ray image ( fig .",
    "[ shell13 ] ) confirms this conclusion .",

    "[ 2specs ] ) , the abundances of mg , si , and s whose lines dominate x - ray spectra are not appreciably different than elsewhere in the remnant .",
    "it is likely that the x - ray spectrum of the central bar is dominated by the swept - up ambient gas and not the sn ejecta . in view of the advanced evolutionary stage of the remnant",
    ", the shocked ejecta must be present there as well , but apparently they do not emit as efficiently as the swept - up ambient medium ( at least at x - ray energies high enough for photons to effectively penetrate the intervening ism ) .",

    "some kind of magnetic braking may be involved @xcite , as seems to be required in other cases as well . in any case",
    ", we can rule out that the knots are moving with anything like @xmath218 ; they would need to be stationary structures such as internal shocks , through which fluid passes .",
    "we point out that while extrapolations of the pwn x - ray power - law spectrum back to the radio result in a `` break '' frequency of 8 ghz with a change in slope of about 0.5 , the expected value for synchrotron losses in a homogeneous source with constant electron injection , this feature in g11.2@xmath00.3  is unlikely to be due to losses , as it would require a magnetic field strength of about 3 mg for an assumed remnant age of 2000 yr .",
    "this value would imply a loss time for 8 kev - emitting electrons less than the 8 yr estimated above by @xmath224 , or about a month , so that the jets could not possibly extend as far as they are observed without clear spectral steepening .    in our interpretation ,",
    "the pwn has already been compressed by the return of the reverse shock . however , unlike most other pwne , the much longer pulsar slowdown timescale for g11.2@xmath00.3  means that the pulsar energy input is about the same as its initial value , rather than far weaker , which is more typical .",
    "we interpret the more extended radio and x - ray nebulae as the remnants of the pre - reverse - shock pwn , and the x - ray jets as more recently produced features .",
    "the integrated spectrum can then be quite complex @xcite , with multiple bends and breaks between radio and x - rays , even without invoking intrinsic spectral structure in the electron distribution produced at the original pulsar - wind termination shock .",
    "@xcite estimates a minimum nonthermal energy for the pwn in g11.2@xmath00.3  which implies a minimum pressure of about @xmath225 dyn @xmath66 .",
    "while he approximates the pwn as a sphere , the estimate is unlikely to be dramatically in error .",
    "it implies a magnetic field of order 50 @xmath22 g , implying an energy loss timescale of about 36 yr for 8 kev - emitting electrons .",
    "this in turn requires a mean flow velocity of about 20,000 km s@xmath2 to avoid producing spectral steepening at the jet ends ",
    "less than our inferred transrelativistic speeds for doppler boosting in the knots , but inconsistent with the absence of outward motion of jet ends .",
    "this minimum pressure is , however , about two orders of magnitude below the pressure to be expected in the remnant interior if all the sn energy has been thermalized ( see below ) .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy in the following section .",
    "the high visual extinction toward g11.2@xmath00.3 , obtained both from [ fe ii ] observations @xcite and from our absorption measurements toward the pwn and the shell , definitively rules out the association of g11.2@xmath00.3  with any naked - eye event seen on earth , in particular with the ce 386 event , unfortunately removing g11.2@xmath00.3  from the short list of snrs with known ages .",
    "however , our mean shell expansion rate of @xmath226% yr@xmath2 gives an age in a comparable range , for a plausible range of expansion parameter @xmath148 between 0.4 and 2/3 , of 1400  2400 yr  comparable to the 1629 yr resulting from the ce 386 association .",
    "we confirm that g11.2@xmath00.3  is one of the three or four youngest shell cc remnants in the galaxy  perhaps third , behind cas a and kes 75 ( containing a young pulsar , with spindown age @xmath227 1700 yr ; mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 , livingstone et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in the pwn",
    ", we have identified a torus - like structure in radio and x - rays .",
    "such structures are commonly seen in pwne , but only in x - rays ; a sharply defined radio torus @xmath228 jet is unique to g11.2@xmath00.3 .",
    "furthermore , the jet in g11.2@xmath00.3  completely dominates the torus  in fact , the bulk of the x - ray pwn emission is from the jet , unlike most pwne with jet / torus structure .",
    "we attribute this characteristic to the very long pulsar slowdown timescale , so that the pulsar energy input is almost the same as at birth .",
    "mildly relativistic outflow could explain the brightness asymmetry between sw and ne jets , though this interpretation is not without problems .",
    "our x - ray spatial analysis shows several anomalous features for a shell snr .",
    "the presence of significant asymmetric interior emission requires significant departures from the simple self - similar driven wave or sedov evolutionary phases .",
    "the sharp inner edge of the outer shell and the hard x - ray emission found near this edge are unexplained in any simple picture .",
    "no sharp x - ray rims are found , unlike all young type ia remnants , where they are found to have nonthermal spectra and indicate significant magnetic - field amplification @xcite .",
    "( some cc remnants also show these rims , such as cas a and the x - ray - synchrotron - dominated remnants g347.3@xmath00.5 ( rx j1713.7@xmath03946 ) and g266.2@xmath01.2 ( rx j0852.0@xmath04622 ) . see @xcite for discussion and references . )",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the shell can be reasonably well described by a thermal , plane - shock model with temperatures of 0.6  0.8 kev , consistent with inferred shock velocities ranging from 700 km s@xmath2 ( at 4.4 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to 1100 km s@xmath2 ( at the largest allowed distance of 7 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are required to account for the measured expansion of the shell .",
    "the emission measures from fits with a more - sophisticated x - ray sedov model indicate a mass of x - ray emitting gas of about @xmath229 @xmath230 , too low for the remnant to be fully in the sedov stage of evolution into a uniform medium .",
    "the bar of central emission running at roughly position angles ( 100@xmath231  280@xmath231 ) has a thermal spectrum , with no clear evidence for enhanced abundances .",
    "the presence of thermal emission near the center of the remnant , and clear morphological correspondences between the inner thermal emission and the pwn , indicate that the reverse shock has already returned to the center and re - shocked all the sn ejecta . since it is expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that g11.2@xmath00.3  is expanding into a stellar wind , a reanalysis of the spectrum for a wind model increases the inferred shocked mass to 15  30 @xmath27 .",
    "however , the predicted morphology of a remnant running into a uniform @xmath232 density profile is not consistent with the sharp shell we observe . the assumption of a smooth , spherically symmetric wind csm is apparently far too simple to explain what we see in g11.2@xmath00.3 .",
    "we summarize here the scenario we propose for this complex object .",
    "we adopt chevalier s ( 2005 ) classification of g11.2@xmath00.3  as resulting from a category of supernovae exploding after losing most of their envelopes ( several solar masses ) prior to explosion .",
    "such substantial mass loss is likely to be quite asymmetric , perhaps due to a binary companion , and we invoke the possibility of a disk wind .",
    "after the explosion , the supernova blast wave has encountered this lost mass , both radially and azimuthally inhomogeneous , and has by now swept up of order 10 solar masses .",
    "the density currently just ahead of the blast wave is quite low , resulting in a diffuse rather than sharp outer edge of shell emission .",
    "the reverse shock has moved all the way back to the center , reheating all ejecta , but csm inhomogeneities have left characteristic imprints , such as the sharp inner edges of the outer shell visible in some locations and the limb - brightened hard x - ray emission in the remnant s interior .",
    "we interpret the presence of hard x - rays near the inner edge of the remnant s outer shell as evidence for an abrupt change in the density distribution of the ambient csm .",
    "this is consistent with the sharp inner edge of the shell .",
    "the shocked low - density gas in the interior of the remnant , including the bulk of the sn ejecta , does not radiate as efficiently as the much denser material in the outer shell , so it is difficult to detect its faint thermal x - ray emission against the bright shell .",
    "only the most dense shocked ambient gas is visible in thermal x - rays as the anomalous bar of interior emission .",
    "x - ray emission from the more tenuous gas is clearly seen only at high photon energies where gas in the shell radiates less efficiently because of its low ( 0.6  0.8 kev ) temperature .",
    "this emission might be of nonthermal origin .",
    "( electrons radiating 8-kev synchrotron photons can survive for @xmath233 yr if @xmath234 g , as might be true in the low - density interior .",
    "internal diffuse x - ray synchrotron emission is also seen in the comparably - aged remnant rcw 86 [ williams et al .",
    "2011 ] , a remnant thought to result from a cavity explosion . ) shocked ejecta have been unambiguously detected only in some very dense clumps which have cooled and are the source of the observed [ fe ii ] near - ir emission .",
    "the pulsar was born with a very low velocity and is still near the remnant center .",
    "the pwn it produced has been compressed by the return of the reverse shock , but in a fairly symmetrical fashion .",
    "the pulsar continues to inject relativistic fluid into the pwn , in a jet / torus configuration in which the jets , rather than the torus , are the most apparent .",
    "this scenario can accommodate most of what is known about g11.2@xmath00.3 , but leaves many important questions unanswered .",
    "most prominent is the nature of the mass lost : evidently its spatial distribution is uneven in all respects .",
    "the inferred density discontinuity in the csm density distribution points to a major change in the nature of mass loss after ejection of the bulk of the stellar envelope in slow and dense outflows .",
    "it is possible that the progenitor was a compact blue star at the time of the explosion , with only a residual hydrogen envelope left on top of its nearly stripped helium core .",
    "this would have resulted in a ( compact ) ciib sn @xcite instead of a iil or an ( extended ) eiib sn expected for much larger red or yellow supergiant progenitors that suffered substantial but not so extreme mass loss .",
    "alternatively , the entire h envelope might have been stripped , and the sn was of type ibc .",
    "most type ciib / ibc sne arise from explosions of tidally - stripped binary progenitors with main - sequence masses less than @xmath235 rather than from explosions of the classical wolf - rayet stars originating in more massive stars @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of g11.2@xmath00.3 was likely a low - mass he star in a close binary system , possibly with a residual h envelope still present as inferred and modeled for the type ciib sn 2008ax @xcite .",
    "such compact progenitors of type ciib / ibc sne lose mass in fast stellar winds that compress denser and more slowly moving material ejected in the prior evolutionary stages into dense shells , with the low - density shocked fast wind filling the interiors of these shells .",
    "their strong ultraviolet radiation heats dust that is present in these shells .",
    "progenitor systems similar to what we infer for g11.2@xmath00.3 , consisting of a low - mass he star , a binary companion that is necessary to strip the h envelope , and a compact ir - emitting shell , are likely present among many compact circumstellar bubbles discovered by _ spitzer _ that are powered by massive stars @xcite .",
    "the nature of interior material is , however , still debatable .",
    "while csm in a disk is a likely arrangement for strongly asymmetric dense csm swept up by the fast wind of a stripped - envelope progenitor , it is also possible that this material is highly asymmetric ejecta . while spectral analysis",
    "does not show obvious heavy - element enhancements anywhere in g11.2@xmath00.3 , a mixture of shocked csm and ejecta might not show clear spectral signatures , particularly if the ejecta were much cooler than the csm .",
    "a mechanism for producing such asymmetric ejecta is unknown at this time .",
    "the thermal pressure in the outer shell is several @xmath236 dyn @xmath66 , and we expect a comparable central pressure if all the sn energy has been thermalized . the estimate of a central thermal pressure of at least @xmath237 dyn @xmath66 , which results from the assumption that only mild pressure variations are present within the interior of g11.2@xmath00.3 , causes serious difficulties in interpreting the pwn .",
    "we showed above that the minimum ( equipartition ) nonthermal pressure in the pwn is two orders of magnitude less .",
    "now there is no guarantee that equipartition must hold .",
    "however , if the magnetic energy dominates , bringing the pwn pressure up to the central thermal pressure would require a magnetic - field strength of about 0.6 mg , in which synchrotron lifetimes of 8 kev - emitting electrons would be only one year  clearly at odds with the lack of spectral steepening in the jets ( which are 2  3 lt - yr long ) .",
    "the maximum magnetic - field strength consistent with that constraint is about 0.2 mg , providing only one - tenth the required pressure .",
    "if the pwn is particle - dominated , not an impossibility , the magnetic - field strength is basically unconstrained .",
    "3-d relativistic mhd simulations @xcite show that magnetic dissipation can lower the magnetic energy to a small fraction of the particle energy .",
    "these simulations also show that a young pwn is a complex object , with strong departures from symmetry in magnetic - field strength and ( to some extent ) in pressure , so all conclusions drawn from assumptions of spherical symmetry should be regarded as provisional .",
    "the high external pressure also implies a pulsar - wind termination shock radius given by @xmath238 or about @xmath239 , far smaller than the size of the torus  but given the drastic oversimplifications ( mainly spherical symmetry ) under which this simple estimate is obtained , perhaps this is not a concern . in any case",
    ", the inner edge of the torus , where the shock would be located , could well be at a much smaller radius .    the inferred thermal pressure , while high , implies a low explosion energy for a distance of 4.4 kpc : @xmath240 erg .",
    "( we accounted for the kinetic energy of the shell in our estimates of the explosion energy but it is a minor ( 20%25% ) contribution to the total energy budget . ) this estimate scales with the volume , or more accurately , @xmath241 erg ; at 7 kpc it rises by about a factor of 4 , more consistent with a typical cc explosion .",
    "it is possible that the outer shell we observe is not the outermost extremity of the snr .",
    "in addition to a few obvious knots at larger radii , it is possible that hot thermal material is able to `` leak '' through the shell in spots , where if the density is sufficiently low it might not be readily detectable in x - rays or infrared . however , it would be more difficult to hide such material from a deep radio image , so it would be worthwhile to revisit g11.2@xmath00.3  with the greatly enhanced capabilities of the jvla to ( among other goals ) search for such a halo .",
    "if present , this halo might also shed light on the origin of outlying h@xmath23 filaments found by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these filaments mark locations where the blast wave has encountered much denser than average material after breaking through the shell .",
    "the ejecta of a stripped - envelope sn contain little ( if any ) h , while dense csm swept up by the blast wave consists mostly of h. the shocked csm and the shocked ejecta in g11.2@xmath00.3 can be distinguished by the presence or absence of h lines in their near - ir spectra and by their kinematics .",
    "@xcite detected the br@xmath242 line in a spectrum of the brightest emission filament in the se , and h@xmath23 emission lines in a spectrum of a spatially - localized region in the s , so the emission there comes mostly from shocked csm .",
    "highly blueshifted ( @xmath233 km s@xmath2 ) knots near the center are devoid of h @xcite , consistent with ejecta of a stripped - envelope sn . the shocked , h - rich csm has been accelerated by the blast wave , but its velocity is expected to be at most one or two hundred km s@xmath2 , far less than the @xmath233 km s@xmath2 found for the h - poor ejecta .",
    "@xcite proposed that the ejecta are rich in fe , but other elements such as he might still be dominant .",
    "( the upper limit to the strength of the 1.083 @xmath22 m line cited by @xcite is not particularly constraining . )",
    "deeper spectra are needed in order to learn more about the composition of the ir - emitting ejecta , but we predict that little ( if any ) h will be found within the sn ejecta .",
    "further understanding of this interesting object will require multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , which can test some of the features of our proposed scenario .",
    "additional observational efforts in radio and in near - ir are the most likely to cast additional light .",
    "a search for a possible surviving binary companion would be quite challenging but , if successful , would be a major advance .",
    "g11.2@xmath00.3  serves as additional evidence , if any were needed , that supernovae , and their remnants , are fundamentally three - dimensional objects , and their full understanding will require three - dimensional theory .",
