    "in systems using code - division multiple access ( cdma ) , user capacity is enhanced by using _ soft handoff _ , @xcite-@xcite . by soft handoff",
    "we mean that a given user communicates simultaneously with two or more base stations until its path gain to just one of them is several db stronger than its path gain to any other .",
    "this is in contrast to _ hard handoff _ , wherein the user communicates at any given time with only one base , selected according to some path gain criterion .",
    "+   + in @xcite , we examined a cdma system consisting of a single macrocell in which a single _ hotspot _ microcell is embedded .",
    "such a microcell might be installed to serve small regions of high user density with a low - cost , low - power base station . using both analysis and simulation , we determined the uplink user capacity ( i.e. , the number of uplink users supported with a specified probability of success ) of this two - tier system under the condition of hard handoff . here , we address the same system when both bases serve each user ( soft handoff ) , and we quantify the gain in uplink user capacity .",
    "the gain is relative to the hard handoff approach , wherein the base selected is the one having the largest path gain to the user terminal .",
    "we focus on the uplink direction because it tends to be the limiting direction , as we showed in @xcite .",
    "+   + section [ assump ] describes the system geometry and the underlying propagation and processing assumptions .",
    "section [ shocap ] presents an exact criterion for determining uplink user capacity in ideal soft handoff , and compares the results to those for hard handoff @xcite .",
    "also presented are two simpler methods , based on an analytical approximation , and they are shown to be quite accurate . while our study is specific to a particular two - tier system in a highly dispersive multipath environment , extensions of our methods to other cases are possible , as we discuss in section [ conc ] .",
    "as in @xcite , we assume a coverage region @xmath0 ( figure 1 ) with a macrocell base at the origin of the coordinate system and a microcell base at a distance @xmath1 along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "for concreteness in our computations , we assume the shape of @xmath0 is a square of side @xmath3 , with the macrocell base at the center .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , ch .",
    "4 , that the uplink capacity for square and circular @xmath0 are virtually the same ; here , the square shape is assumed in order to simplify computations .",
    "+   + all system users desire a rate @xmath4 and use a processing gain @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the system bandwidth .",
    "we assume that the potential users are made up of two populations : one consists of low - density ( ld ) users , distributed uniformly over the entire coverage region ; the other consists of high - density ( hd ) users , distributed uniformly over a small square area surrounding the microcell base .",
    "the side of this smaller square is @xmath7 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the probability that a randomly selected user is from the hd population . the probability that a user is from the ld population is , of course , @xmath9 .",
    "we call @xmath8 the _ hotspot density_. +   + the path gain , @xmath10 , between either base and a user at a distance @xmath11 is assumed to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the `` breakpoint distance '' @xcite ( in the same units as @xmath11 ) at which the slope of the db path gain versus distance changes ; @xmath14 is a zero - mean gaussian random variable for each user distance , with standard deviation @xmath15 ; and @xmath16 is a proportionality constant that depends on wavelength , antenna heights , and antenna gains .",
    "note that @xmath10 is a local spatial average , so that multipath effects are averaged out .",
    "there can be different values of @xmath13 for the microcell and macrocell , and similarly for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is often referred to as lognormal shadow fading , which varies slowly over the terrain . both @xmath14 and @xmath11 are random variables for a randomly selected user .",
    "+   + in analyzing soft handoff performance , we will make the following assumptions : ( 1 ) each user in the environment is processed by _ both _ bases , regardless of the user s path gains to the two bases .",
    "( 2 ) at each base , ideal rake processing is performed on each user s received signal in order to maximize diversity ; ( 3 ) each user - base path is `` infinitely dispersive , '' , meaning that there is a near - infinitude of resolvable , comparable - strength multipaths on each link . given ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , the receiver output signal sample for each user will be non - fading , just as if the link had a single path of fixed gain .",
    "we can therefore proceed by assuming the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) condition for each link , which simplifies the analysis .",
    "the implications of this assumption , and its relaxation , are discussed in section iv .",
    "from the foregoing , we can proceed as though user @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) has signal path gains @xmath20 and @xmath21 to the macrocell and microcell , respectively .",
    "this user transmits a signal at power @xmath22 , which is controlled by the bases .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the phases of the path gains from user @xmath18 to the macrocell and microcell bases , respectively . in the soft - handoff scenario studied here ,",
    "both the macrocell and microcell bases receive , despread , and rake - combine the signal from each of the @xmath25 users .",
    "there are , therefore , two output streams ( one at the macrocell and one at the microcell ) which contain a user s desired signal .",
    "each of these two streams also contains interference from the @xmath26 other users plus thermal noise .",
    "+   + the output streams at the macrocell and microcell bases are weighted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , and then summed . after combining ,",
    "the overall output sinr ( signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ) of user @xmath18 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the thermal noise power in the system bandwidth .",
    "this sinr equation implicitly treats the interference from each user @xmath32 as if it is uncorrelated between bases .",
    "in fact , the two interferences from user @xmath32 _ are _ correlated , as they carry the same data .",
    "the combiner output voltage sample from user @xmath18 is therefore proportional to @xmath33 and the squared magnitude has a cross - term proportional to the cosine of a path - gain - related phase .",
    "the phase term is uniformly random on @xmath34 , and so the sum over @xmath35 of all cross - terms will converge to a mean of zero as @xmath25 approaches infinity",
    ". for the values of @xmath25 of interest here , substitution of this mean value is a very reasonable approximation ; hence ( 2 ) applies .",
    "+   + the system studied here uses path - gain - weighted combining , i.e. , it co - phases the two signals , via the phases of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and uses the following magnitudes for @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath36 . using these values and the assumed co - phasing , we can simplify ( 2 ) : @xmath37 we desire @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the minimum required sinr for each user . setting @xmath40 for all",
    "@xmath18 leads to a matrix solution to the @xmath22 s that has the following form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( note @xmath43 is the _ single - cell pole capacity _",
    "@xcite ) ; @xmath44^t$ ] ; @xmath45 is an @xmath25 x @xmath25 matrix , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is an @xmath25 x @xmath48 vector with each element equal to one .",
    "note that the elements of @xmath45 s are random variables , since each path gain @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is determined by the random location and shadow fading of user @xmath18 relative to the macrocell ( microcell ) .",
    "+   + the two - tier system can support @xmath25 total users if and only if the transmit power levels in ( [ sho_pwrs ] ) are positive , and this occurs if and only if the determinant of @xmath45 is positive .",
    "the randomness of @xmath45 implies that this _ feasibility _ of supporting @xmath25 users occurs with some probability .",
    "the size of the random matrix @xmath45 complicates the actual calculation of this probability of feasibility . nevertheless , it is possible to use simulation methods to perform this calculation and gain insight into the capacity performance of the two - tier system under soft - handoff .",
    "+   + we performed simulations to find the 95% value of @xmath25 using the following method : for the two - tier , two - cell system , with parameters as in table 1 , we performed 10,000 trials . in each trial , the two path gains for each of @xmath25 randomly - selected users were generated .",
    "these gains were then used to form the matrix @xmath45 and compute its determinant . the feasibility ( success ) of the user set",
    "was determined by the sign of this determinant , and the probability of success over the 10,000 trials was computed for the selected @xmath25 .",
    "the simulation program obtained the value of @xmath25 for which 95% of trials yielded feasibility .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ sho_results1 ] , where we plot @xmath25 as a function of @xmath8 , the hotspot density .",
    "we also plot the hard - handoff results from @xcite .",
    "the plots show that user capacity varies with @xmath8 , the maximum occurring at roughly @xmath51 .",
    "this is the density for which , on average , half of all users lies in the microcell coverage area . with this condition , the system contains roughly an equal number of users per base , which our previous work shows leads to maximum capacity @xcite , chap .",
    "4 . figure [ sho_results1 ] also shows that for all @xmath8 , the capacity is higher for soft handoff than for hard - handoff , and these gains are at most 20% .      due to the complexity in computing the exact user capacity for soft handoff ( as outlined above ) , we now present an approximation method .",
    "we resort to the fiction that , _ in the denominator _ of ( 2 ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same for all users ; we call these weights @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the common values are assumed to be @xmath56 and @xmath57 in other words , the weights @xmath54 and @xmath58 are the average values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 over the @xmath25 users . using these constant weights , the denominator in ( [ sho_sinr_eq ] ) is @xmath59 this term is independent of @xmath18 except for the third and fourth terms , which are small compared to the first and second terms for @xmath25 large . if we ignore them , we obtain a common ( @xmath18-independent ) denominator given by @xmath60 assuming the denominator in ( [ sho_sinr_new ] ) is replaced by @xmath61 , and setting @xmath62 to the required value of @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath63 substituting this into ( [ constantd ] ) , we obtain @xmath64 solving for @xmath61 , we get @xmath65}.\\ ] ] using ( [ sho_wm])-([sho_wmu ] ) for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we see that this quantity ( i.e. , each @xmath22 ) is positive if and only if @xmath66 this feasibility condition is far - simpler to examine than @xmath67 . +   + we applied this approximation technique to the same system studied above . as",
    "before , we used 10,000 trials for each of several values of @xmath25 . in each trial",
    ", we generated random user locations and shadow fadings for @xmath25 users , leading to @xmath25 pairs of @xmath68 . using ( [ sho_feas_approx ] )",
    ", we then determined whether power control was feasible .",
    "doing this for all trials , we were able to compute a probability of feasibility for the given @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we found the value of @xmath25 corresponding to 95% probability .",
    "this @xmath25 is plotted against @xmath8 in figure 2 ( `` approx . 1 '' ) .",
    "we see that there is very good agreement ; the approximation over - estimates capacity by at most three users , or roughly 7% .",
    "we now develop an even simpler analytical method to compute uplink capacity .",
    "we first note that ( 14 ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 since @xmath71 and @xmath72 are random variables , we can rewrite them as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent random perturbations of @xmath71 and @xmath72 about their mean values , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "based on this new representation , ( [ new17 ] ) changes to @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . since @xmath82 , we have , @xmath83 .",
    "we make this substitution and put the complex value @xmath84 on a better basis by performing phase rotation .",
    "this is done by multiplying @xmath85 by @xmath86 .",
    "the rotated representation of @xmath85 is then @xmath87 where we have used @xmath82 .",
    "the feasibility condition in ( [ newnew17 ] ) can now be written as @xmath88 .",
    "+   + a key step in this approximation is to first assume that",
    "latexmath:[$|x'| \\approx    to the standard deviation of @xmath75 ( as it is for large @xmath25 ) , we ignore the quadrature term of @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the feasibility condition is approximated as @xmath91 next , we use the central limit theorem to approximate @xmath75 , which is a sum of i.i.d",
    ". random terms , as a zero - mean guassian variate .",
    "let us represent the left side of ( [ newnewnew17 ] ) as @xmath92 , with mean @xmath93 and standard deviation @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the mean and variance of each i.i.d .",
    "term in the sum @xmath71 , ( 16 ) , then it can be shown that @xmath97 this implies that feasibility occurs with probability @xmath98 or greater if and only if @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the @xmath98-th percentile value of a zero - mean , unit - variance guassian variate .",
    "this approximation produces a simple , closed - form solution for the capacity supported in a two - tier system for a desired level of feasibility , @xmath98 .",
    "given @xmath98 ( assumed here to be 0.95 ) and values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which can be determined using either simulation or analysis , user capacity can be simply estimated . +   + we used simulation to estimate @xmath95 and @xmath96 for numerous values of @xmath8 .",
    "then , invoking ( [ brandnew ] ) and rounding to the next lower integer , we obtained the result shown in figure 2 ( `` approx . 2 '' ) .",
    "we see that this new approximation overestimates the results from section [ approx1 ] by at most one user and exceeds the results from simulation by at most 4 users , corresponding to 10% .",
    "we have devised three methods of soft handoff assessment that become progressively simpler to implement , in exchange for modest overestimations of capacity ( less than 10% ) .",
    "our results suggest that the uplink capacity benefit of soft handoff over hard handoff is minor for the two - tier , two - cell system we have examined . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the gain is no more than 20% for any value of hotspot density .",
    "however , this gain will be higher if the microcell base transmits and receives at a higher power , i.e , if @xmath101 is larger . with a larger @xmath101 , each user s total received power after path - gain - weighted combining",
    "will be higher , whereas under hard handoff , the attainable user capacity does not change as @xmath101 increases @xcite . the gain due to soft handoff",
    "will also be higher if this mechanism is used in a system with multiple embedded microcells .",
    "each embedded microcell offers an additional path from the user and thus improves the total received power after path - gain - weighted combining .",
    "the techniques presented here can be used to determine the capacity gains when @xmath101 increases ; the gain offered by multiple embedded microcells is a topic of future research .",
    "+   + our results are obtained for highly dispersive channels and ideal rake receivers . for scenarios exhibiting less protection against multipath @xcite ,",
    "soft handoff provides a micro - diversity benefit ( against multipath fading ) and a macro - diversity benefit ( against shadow fading ) , so the soft handoff improvement will be greater . the key point , however , is that , as cdma systems become more and more wideband , the capacity improvement due to soft handoff will become more modest .",
