    "transit timing variations ( ttvs ) of transits are expected in transiting extrasolar planetary systems where the host star has more than one companion .",
    "this effect might reveal the presence of other companions with smaller masses ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or co - orbital bodies as well @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the system has two or more known planetary components , the magnitude of the ttv effects can be predicted and/or used to characterize the system more precisely @xcite .",
    "similarly , the lack of ttvs can rule out other companions above a certain limit @xcite .",
    "one should note that even two - body systems ( i.e. the parent star and the planet ) can show significant ttvs due to non - gravitational physical processes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and in the case of eccentric orbits , there are intrinsic timing variations due to the effects of general relativity ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the case of two planetary companions ,",
    "the magnitude of the ttv effects can be predicted analytically using the same methodology that is known for hierarchical stellar systems @xcite , and of course , by numerical integrations .    at the time of its discovery ,",
    "the planetary system orbiting the star hat - p-13 was the only known multiple extrasolar planetary system that exhibits at least one transiting planet as well ( hat - p-13b , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "follow - up studies showed that the host star has a spin alignment with respect to the orbital plane of the transiting planet @xcite as well as this work also noticed a significant long - term drift in the radial velocity of the host star that might be interpreted as a presence of a third companion .",
    "additional studies @xcite reported the lack of primary transits of the long - period second companion hat - p-13c , and presented additional observations from the transits of the close - in planet as well .",
    "as of this writing , no other ( than * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) publicly available photometric data are available for this planetary system . here",
    "we describe recent photometric measurements of the host star .",
    "the analysis of the light curves showed significant timing variations since the last public ephemerides .",
    "the structure of this letter is as follows . in section  [ sec : observations ] we describe details of the observations , data reduction and light curve modelling .",
    "the analysis of the results yielded by light curve fits is presented in section  [ sec : timing ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses possible scenarios for the observed ttvs and summarizes our results .",
    "we carried out photometric observations of the star hat - p-13 with the telescopes of the konkoly observatory , located at the piszkstet mountain station on three separate nights . on the night of 2010",
    "december 27/28 , we used the 60/90/180 cm schmidt telescope , equipped with an apogee alta - u @xmath2 ccd camera . the following two events , on the night of december 30/31 and 2011 januar 28/29 has been partially observed ( due to weather circumstances on december 30 and due to dawn twilight on januar 28 ) with the 100 cm ritchey - chrtien - coud ( rcc ) telescope equipped with a princeton instruments versarray @xmath3 camera .",
    "these setups of optics and cameras yielded a square - shaped field - of - view with a size of @xmath4 and @xmath5 degrees , for the schmidt and rcc telescopes , respectively . at the first night we used bessel i filter and an exposure time of 20seconds ( 42seconds cadence )",
    "while in the second and third night we used cousins r filter and an exposure time of 60 and 25seconds , respectively ( here the readout time is relatively short , so this can be used as a cadence as well and on the last night the seeing was much better hence the shorter exposure time ) .    in the following",
    "we describe the data reduction processes and some aspects of the light curve modelling .",
    "reduction of raw technical and scientific frames has been carried out with the pipelines built on the software package described in @xcite .",
    "the calibration procedure followed the standard way of dark subtraction and flat - field corrections using dark frames taken with similar exposures as the scientific images .",
    "( employing the tasks ` ficalib ` and ` ficombine ` ) .",
    "the source identification , astrometric solution and centroid coordinates were derived as follows .",
    "first , individual point - like sources were extracted from each frame using the task ` fistar ` .",
    "these lists of profile coordinates were then cross - matched @xcite between the frames and a reference frame , yielding both a list of matched pairs and the spatial transformation between two images .",
    "the polynomial order of the spatial transformation were 3 and 1 for the schmidt and rcc fields , respectively ( increasing these orders did not decrease the unbiased fit residuals ) .",
    "then , using these initial differential astrometric solutions , the stellar pixel coordinates were refined using an independent profile centroid fit ( done by the task ` fiphot ` ) for the expected positions .",
    "these lists of refined profile coordinates were used to refine the spatial transformation as well .",
    "this is a rather relevant step because the point matching task ( ` grmatch ` ) sometimes misses a point and the exclusion of even a single point can yield a systematic deviation in the transformation coefficients whose error can propagate into the photometry errors ( resulting in unexpected red noise ) . following this two - stage astrometry ,",
    "these refined coefficients were used to transform the reference object list to the system of individual frames to perform aperture photometry . involving the task ` fiphot ` ,",
    "aperture photometry was performed with annuli of appropriate sizes and a series of apertures from which we picked the best one later on the modelling .",
    "differential magnitudes were then computed from these raw instrumental magnitudes using several nearby comparison stars .",
    "the white - noise uncertainties of the individual photometric points were derived from the photon noise , background noise and scintillation @xcite noise components of both the target star and comparison stars .",
    "light curves obtained by the procedure ( as described above ) have been used to model the transit event and derive the respective parameters . in order to fit a model light curve to the observed data , we employed the analytic formulae of @xcite .",
    "the effects of stellar limb darkening have been taken into account by fixing the quadratic limb darkening coefficients using the stellar atmospheric parameters @xcite .",
    "these coefficients have been derived from the tables of @xcite .",
    "since many of the regression methods used by us require the knowledge of parametric derivatives of the model function , we used the formulae provided by @xcite to compute these partial derivatives .",
    "the light curve models have been parameterised using @xmath6 , the planet - to - star size ratio , @xmath7 , the square of the impact parameter , the quantity @xmath8 , related to the duration of the transit as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the time instance at the center of the transit ( here @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the time instances when the center of the planet disc intersects the limb of the star inwards and outwards , respectively ) .",
    "see also @xcite for further details on the advantages of this parameterisation .",
    "in addition to these parameters , we fitted simultaneously the out - of - transit magnitude , a linear trend in the out - of - transit magnitude ( correcting to the effects of changing airmasses ) and a linear decorrelation parameter against the variations resulted by the changes in the profile fwhm . in the case of the observation on 2010 december 30/31",
    ", we kept @xmath13 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 fixed , since this light curve does not cover the entire transit event .",
    "we employed the markov chain monte carlo method ( mcmc ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the fit parameters from which the best fit values , uncertainties and correlations can easily be derived .",
    "the best fit values for the light curve shape parameters for the event 2010 december 27/28 are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these values agrees well with the previously published ones @xcite .",
    "[ fig : hatp13-lc ] shows the light curves with these best fit model functions superimposed while the best fit values for the transit center instances are listed in table  [ table : timing ] .",
    "this table also lists the previously published individual transit event instances as well , from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fit residuals has been compared to the expected residual value that can be computed from the photon noise , background noise and scintillation of the star .",
    "we find that the fit residuals for the observation of 2010 december 27/28 were only larger by a factor of @xmath17 , that indicates a very good quality light curve with small systematic variations ( red noise ) . indeed ,",
    "even the raw instrumental magnitudes ( i.e. the magnitude of the target star without subtracting any comparison star ) varied in a range of only @xmath18mag .",
    "however , the analysis of the observation from 2010 december 30/31 yielded a fit residual that is larger by a factor of @xmath19 than the expected and as it clear from the lower plot on fig .",
    "[ fig : hatp13-lc ] , the residuals contain significant amount of red noise .",
    "this was due to both weather circumstances and significant flat field image structures in the vicinity of hat - p-13 .",
    "therefore we conservatively scaled up the derived errors by that factor of @xmath20 ( and this is the value that has been reported in table  [ table : timing ] ) .",
    "the observation carried out on 2011 january 28/29 was partial : the out - of - transit part of the light curve after the transit was not measured , however , the observed egress can be incorporated into the light curve analysis .",
    "this fit has been done similarly as for the night of december 27/28 and yielded @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these values also agrees well ( within uncertainties ) both with the fit of december 27/28 data and the published values . for the center of the transit",
    ", we obtain the value found in table  [ table : timing ] . for this analysis ,",
    "the uncertainties yielded by the mcmc fit have been multiplied by @xmath24 in order to take into account the red noise components : this value is the ratio of the fit residuals and the expected formal photometric errors ( those have been derived from the photon and background noise and the scintillation ) .",
    "the uncertainties reported above for the geometric parameters and listed in table  [ table : timing ] are these increased values .",
    ".transit center instances from previous works and recent measurements .",
    "data for the events @xmath25  @xmath26 are available from bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for the events @xmath27 and @xmath28 data are taken from szab et al .",
    "the last three fields are the new measurements presented in this letter .",
    "the event enumeration is from the same reference epoch as in bakos et al .",
    "see text for further details . [",
    "cols=\">,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "using the data of @xcite and @xcite , the subsequent observed transit events can be modelled easily with a strictly periodic assumption : the formal errors reported in these papers yield an unbiased residual of @xmath29 for these 7 degrees of freedom . by defining the event @xmath30 as the reference epoch , this linear model yields @xmath31 ( bjd ) and @xmath32  days while @xmath33 .",
    "these ephemerides gives an uncertainty of @xmath34  days for the predictions of the discussed events ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the nights 2010 december 27/28 , 30/31 and january 28/29 ) . as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : hatp13-ttv ] , these three recent measurements outlie from the linear fit by @xmath38-@xmath39 , @xmath40-@xmath39 and @xmath41-@xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we note here that the significance of the first ( december 27/28 ) measurement is determined mostly by the uncertainty of the predictions while the significance of the second one is determined by the uncertainty of that particular measurement . all in all",
    ", both values can be treated as a significant deviation .",
    "due to the significance of the results , i.e. the deviance of the transit center instances from the predictions , we applied several independent analysis methods .",
    "these methods include the minimisation algorithm based on the downhill simplex method @xcite , as well as a one - parameter scan . in the latter test ,",
    "the light curve shape parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) have been fixed and only the @xmath42 has been varied while the out - of - transit magnitude and other decorrelation parameters ( see above ) have been minimised using the classic linear least squares method . additionally , we compared the statistical covariances with the covariances yielded by linear error propagation analysis .",
    "all of these methods have confirmed the results and uncertainties of the markov chain monte carlo analysis presented in the previous section .",
    "in addition to these tests , we checked other data acquistion logs to exclude other sources of possible systematic effects .",
    "the filesystem metadata information has been compared with the fits keywords as well as the logs of the ntp daemon were also checked ( this showed an approximately 0.002  seconds of standard deviation from the time synchronization servers ) .",
    "there are a few examples for extrasolar planets proven to exhibit ttv .",
    "wasp-3b has been found to display a full ttv amplitude of @xmath43  day period . as an explanation",
    ", a third planet has been inferred on a resonance orbit that may be either an inner or outer perturber @xcite .",
    "the ttv of wasp-5 is about 0.0023 day , and a set of different perturber solutions were invoked that can equivalently well explain the observed ttv @xcite .",
    "wasp-10 exhibits a similar ttv to that of wasp-3 and wasp-5 , its ttv has a full amplitude of @xmath44  day with @xmath45day period .",
    "the perturber has been suggested to have @xmath46 mass and orbit in @xmath47 mean motion resonance with wasp-10b @xcite .",
    "other sources than perturbing planets are also known as sources of ttv , such as exomoons orbiting the planets @xcite .",
    "however , the transit timing variations are in the order of a few seconds / minutes in the case of plausible moons , and the measured ttv of hat - p-13b is not compatible with this predicted ttv amplitude .",
    "the detected @xmath48 of hat - p-13b is in the order of @xmath49  days , significantly more than that of wasp-3 , wasp-5 or wasp-10 .",
    "kepler-9b , c represent an example for such large ttv amplitude exhibited by neptunes that orbit in strong resonance @xcite . however , hat - p-13b is not very similar to the case of kepler-9b , c .",
    "the planets in the kepler-9 system exhibit a continuous variation of ttv with a period of few hundred days , while hat - p-13b seemed to lack ttv during the first three years of follow - up observations , and then a sudden switch of ttv is observed .",
    "this observed behaviour and the ttv amplitude of hat - p-13b may be explained by perturbations by long period planets on non - resonant orbits .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , a model planet similar to corot-9 exhibits a large switch in @xmath48 of the inner planet in less than @xmath50year . assuming an outer perturber of @xmath46 mass , @xmath51  day orbital period and @xmath52 eccentricity , the predicted amplitude results to be @xmath53  days ( see fig .  6 in the cited paper ) .",
    "this value is quite similar to the @xmath48 variation that we report for hat - p-13 , suggesting that perturbations on the time - scale of the orbital period of a long - period perturber can explain our inferred ttv of hat - p-13b .",
    "the detailed modeling is beyond the information content of the currently available dataset : there would be at least @xmath54 orbital parameters to explain with the amplitude and the timing of the switch of the @xmath48 diagram , leading to a highly unconstrained problem",
    ". it may be unlikely that we observed perturbations of hat - p-13c , because this non - resonant perturber would lead to ttv variations with @xmath55  day amplitude and additional secular components .",
    "this period is covered by the current dataset and there are no signs for this period in the deduced ttv .",
    "eventually , the most urgent task is deriving the period of the ttv shown by hat - p-13b before predictions can be given to the nature of the perturber .",
    "the work of a.  p. has been supported by the esa grant pecs  98073 and by the jnos bolyai research scholarship of the hungarian academy of sciences .",
