    "it is a general principle of effective field theory that one should include all operators consistent with symmetry constraints when constructing a low - energy effective lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "such operators are suppressed by powers of the ultraviolet cutoff , so that each has the appropriate mass dimension , and multiplied by coefficients that parameterize the unknown physics relevant at higher energy scales .",
    "when this approach is applied to models with a low quantum gravity scale  @xcite , one obtains a multitude of phenomenological disasters , unless specific mechanisms are invoked to suppress contributions to processes that are suppressed or absent in the standard model  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility that baryon - number - violating operators are present generically in such theories  @xcite , but are suppressed by an additional , non - anomalous , spontaneously - broken u(1 ) gauge symmetry that is orthogonal to hypercharge  @xcite .",
    "we will argue that the natural scale for the breaking of this symmetry is @xmath0  tev , so that our scenario may have testable consequences at the fermilab tevatron , or at the next generation of collider experiments .",
    "we focus on baryon number violation since it is by far the most dangerous of nonstandard model processes",
    ". even if the planck scale has its conventional value @xmath1  gev , the most general set of planck - suppressed , baryon - number - violating operators lead to proton decay at a rate that is much too fast , unless there is some additional parametric suppression .",
    "for example , the superpotential operator @xmath2 must be suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath3 to avoid conflict with the proton lifetime bounds from superkamiokande  @xcite . for a high planck scale , this additional suppression factor can originate from the same sequential breaking of flavor symmetries that may account for the smallness of the yukawa couplings of the first two generations  @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath4 is in the @xmath5  tev range , which can be the case in models with extra spacetime dimensions compactified at the tev - scale , then a much higher degree of suppression is required .",
    "we will show that a flavor - universal u(1 ) gauge symmetry , isomorphic to baryon number on the standard model particle content and spontaneously broken only slightly above the weak scale , is sufficient to avoid any phenomenological problems stemming from baryon - number - violating operators .",
    "it is worth stressing that there are probably many possible ways of suppressing or eliminating proton decay in theories with a low planck scale .",
    "one elegant suggestion made by arkani - hamed and schmaltz is that quarks and leptons may be localized at different points in an extra dimension , so that proton decay operators are suppressed by the tiny overlap of the quark and lepton wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the approach that we consider here is complementary in that it applies also to the case when quarks and leptons are fixed to a single brane , with no separation .",
    "no doubt , this possibility has met considerable interest in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "there is some relationship between the present work and earlier papers on the possibility of gauged baryon number , in which the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking was taken _ below _",
    "@xmath6  @xcite . while the proton decay issue was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model used as a basis for the argument is now excluded at above the @xmath7 confidence level from bounds on the electroweak @xmath8 parameter  the model required a fourth chiral generation to cancel gauge anomalies .",
    "other possibilities for anomaly cancellation discussed in the first version of ref .",
    "@xcite are excluded by @xmath8 , and are also inconsistent with gauge coupling unification . here",
    "we will present a supersymmetric model that is consistent with unification ( in the case where all gauge and higgs fields live in the bulk  @xcite ) as well as the anomaly - cancellation constraints .",
    "the required extra matter is chiral under the full gauge group , but vector - like under the standard model gauge factors , so that the @xmath8 parameter bound may be avoided .",
    "the extra matter fields get masses of order the u(1 ) breaking scale @xmath9 , which in principle could be decoupled from the weak scale .",
    "we suggest , however , that a natural possibility for generating @xmath9 is a radiative breaking scenario that relates this scale to the scale of supersymmetry breaking . in this case , the new physics we introduce becomes relevant for tev - scale collider experiments .",
    "one of the distinctive features of the @xmath10 boson in the class of models we consider is its natural leptophobia . while it may be tempting to think that a model with gauged baryon number is leptophobic by design , it is not hard to see that this statement is patently false . generically , any additional u(1 ) symmetry will mix with hypercharge via the kinetic interaction @xmath11 which is not forbidden by any symmetry of the low - energy theory . even if @xmath12 is identically zero at the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory @xmath4 , it will be renormalized at one loop by all particles that carry both hypercharge and the additional u(1 ) charge , so that @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the class of models that we consider here have the property that @xmath15 , and in addition @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the baryon number and hypercharge matrices , and the trace sums over all fields in the theory .",
    "it is in this sense that we say the additional u(1 ) is orthogonal to hypercharge .",
    "such orthogonal u(1 ) s are known to arise in string theory  @xcite , though we will not commit ourselves to any specific string - theoretic embedding .",
    "the constraint @xmath19 assures that the mixing parameter @xmath20 remains zero until the heaviest particle threshold is crossed . in our models ,",
    "the heaviest particle threshold includes all the nonstandard particles introduced to cancel anomalies ; thus the running of @xmath20 begins after the exotic states are integrated out , and hence is controlled _ solely _ by the standard model particle content .",
    "this gives our phenomenological analysis a high degree of model independence : a similar model with different nonstandard matter content would have identical @xmath10 phenomenology .",
    "models that suppress proton decay and have a different phenomenology , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "it is worth stressing that the leptophobia of the @xmath10 in this model ( as well as the leptophobia of its kaluza - klein excitations ) is quite robust .",
    "for example , one might think that the @xmath10 could be made less leptophobic by taking the scale @xmath9 to be high ( so that @xmath20 would have a greater distance to run ) .",
    "however , this possibility is inconsistent with the assumption that ( a ) the @xmath10 zero mode is phenomenologically relevant and ( b ) the model is consistent with unification . since we do nt know the string normalization of the new u(1 ) gauge coupling",
    ", we only require that it not differ wildly in strength from hypercharge at low energies . for a @xmath10 with mass @xmath21  tev , and coupling @xmath22",
    ", the associated symmetry breaking scale @xmath23 can not be arbitrarily high .",
    "since this is also the scale of the exotic matter content , @xmath20 can not run over very large intervals .",
    "if one takes @xmath24 to be smaller , the scale at which running begins is pushed up , but @xmath20 runs more slowly due to the reduced coupling .",
    "we study this effect quantitatively in section  3 .",
    "finally , if one is willing to sacrifice simple power - law unification , as in the original scenario of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali  @xcite , then it is possible to consider a scenario where only gravity and the additional u(1 ) may propagate into the extra dimensional bulk space .",
    "what is interesting about this possibility is that strongest bounds on the compactification scale come solely from the effects of the new u(1 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath10 and its kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations may be brought within the kinematic reach of the tevatron .",
    "we show that for gauge couplings not much smaller than that of hypercharge , the @xmath10 and its first few kk modes could remain invisible at run i of the tevatron , but be discerned easily at run ii . for this model ,",
    "the ability of a collider experiment to probe weak couplings is as important as mass reach ; we show that the enhanced luminosity of run ii could allow the tevatron to probe a significant region of the model s parameter space .    in the next section , we highlight the points discussed above by presenting a concrete example .",
    "we do not view this model as unique , but rather as a representative example of a class of orthogonal u(1 ) models that have similar low - energy physics .",
    "in section  3 we discuss the low - energy phenomenology of our scenario , and in the final section present our conclusions .",
    "the gauge group is that of the standard model with an additional u(1 ) factor : @xmath25 we normalize the gauge coupling @xmath24 such that all standard model quarks have charge @xmath26 , while all leptons and standard model higgs fields have charge @xmath27 ; these are the conventional charge assignments for baryon number in the standard model .",
    "gauging this symmetry requires the introduction of exotic matter to cancel chiral gauge anomalies , as well as additional higgs fields to spontaneously break the symmetry and avoid long - range forces .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that this can be done in a relatively simple way , consistent with a number of important phenomenological constraints . in particular , we show that exotic matter can be chosen such that the model ( 1 ) is consistent with gauge unification , ( 2 ) is anomaly free , ( 3 ) suppresses proton decay sufficiently , ( 4 ) has no unwanted stable colored or charged states , and ( 5 ) has a mechanism for giving the exotic matter mass .",
    "we present the model by considering these issues systematically :    _ gauge unification_. we would like our model to be consistent with power - law unification  @xcite , at least in the case where all the gauge and higgs fields are allowed to propagate into the extra - dimensional space . since the string normalization of the additional u(1 ) is uncertain  @xcite , we seek to preserve unification of the ordinary standard model gauge factors while allowing @xmath24 to assume values at low energies that do not differ wildly from that of hypercharge .",
    "we therefore require that the exotic matter fields fall in complete su(5 ) representations .",
    "while there are of course other possibilities  @xcite , this is the simplest .",
    "we introduce an extra generation that is vector - like under the standard model gauge factors but chiral under u(1)@xmath28 : @xmath29 although we assume supersymmetry , we show only the fermionic components above .",
    "the overlines indicate dirac adjoints , and the @xmath30 s represent the u(1)@xmath28 charges , yet to be specified .",
    "( four distinct u(1)@xmath28 charges is the smallest number we found that could produce a viable model . )",
    "the charges under the standard model gauge factors for fields in the first column are precisely the same as those of fields in an ordinary standard model generation ; the only exception is @xmath31 which is a standard model singlet .",
    "the fields in the second column have conjugate standard model charges so that , for example , @xmath32 would be invariant if @xmath33 .",
    "as we will see below , our choices for the @xmath34 are such that all the fields in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fields ] ) obtain masses of order the u(1)@xmath28 breaking scale .",
    "_ anomaly cancellation _ we now aim to restrict the @xmath34 so that the model is free of gauge anomalies .",
    "we first note that triangle diagrams involving only standard model gauge factors remain vanishing since the additional matter is introduced in complete generations .",
    "we therefore must consider anomalies of the form u(1)@xmath35 , @xmath36u(1)@xmath37 and @xmath38u(1)@xmath28 , where @xmath36 represents any of the standard model group factors .",
    "given the tracelessness of the non - abelian generators , this reduces the relevant anomalies to the set : u(1)@xmath39u(1)@xmath40 , su(3)@xmath41u(1)@xmath28 , su(2)@xmath41u(1)@xmath28 , u(1)@xmath42u(1)@xmath28 , and u(1)@xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that the su(3)@xmath41u(1)@xmath28 anomaly vanishes since all colored matter with the same u(1)@xmath28 charge comes in groups with equal numbers of left- and right - handed fields .",
    "the same can be said of the u(1)@xmath43 anomaly , since the additional @xmath44 states assure that the exotic ` leptons ' with the same u(1)@xmath28 charge again come in equal numbers of left- and right - handed fields .",
    "finally , we can dispense with the u(1)@xmath39u(1)@xmath40 anomaly by noting that every group of particles with the same u(1)@xmath28 charge separately satisfies @xmath45 .",
    "the remaining two anomaly cancellation conditions , su(2)@xmath41u(1)@xmath28 and u(1)@xmath42u(1)@xmath28 , give exactly the same constraint @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 given the charges defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fields ] ) , we impose eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomcon ] ) to render our theory free of anomalies .",
    "notice that @xmath48 and @xmath49 also represent the charges of higgs fields that we require to give the exotic matter fields masses when u(1)@xmath28 is spontaneously broken .",
    "the most economical exotic higgs sector is obtained by setting @xmath50 then all the desired mass terms may be formed by introducing a single pair of higgs fields @xmath51 with charges @xmath52 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "this is the minimal possibility , since , as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a vector - like pair of higgs superfields is required to avoid additional anomalies .",
    "the choice of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallhiggs ] ) together with the constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomcon ] ) implies that either @xmath53 the remaining freedom to choose exotic u(1)@xmath28 charges will be important in satisfying the other phenomenological constraints below .    _",
    "proton decay_. if our additional u(1 ) symmetry were unbroken , then it would be clear that all operators contributing to proton decay would be exactly forbidden . when the symmetry is spontaneously broken , the form of baryon - number - violating operators in the low - energy effective theory depends on the charge assignment of the higgs fields which break u(1)@xmath28 , as well as on the size of their vacuum expectation values ( vevs )",
    "let us work in the very low - energy limit , below the scales of extra dimensions , exotic matter , and supersymmetry breaking , which we will take to be @xmath54  tev universally for the purposes of the present argument .",
    "in this effective nonsupersymmetric theory , operators that could contribute to proton decay have the form  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent generic quark and lepton fields , respectively , and @xmath58 represents the vev of either @xmath59 or @xmath60 . here",
    "we have suppressed both the dirac structure of the operator and the standard model gauge indices for convenience .",
    "first , we note that since the lepton electric charge is integral , @xmath61 must be a multiple of @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 .",
    "it follows that the baryon number of @xmath64 is @xmath65 , which is an integer . on the other hand , this must be compensated by the baryon number of @xmath58 , which is either @xmath66 or @xmath67 , given the charges of the @xmath59 fields already discussed .",
    "thus we conclude that the operators represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfirst ] ) must be of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are integers .",
    "the point is simple : the fact that the possible symmetry breaking ` spurions ' have fractional u(1)@xmath28 charges forces the baryon - number - violating operators to contribute to no less than @xmath71 transitions .",
    "this renders our model safe from proton decay as well as @xmath72-@xmath73 oscillations .",
    "the operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bigops ] ) are suppressed by high powers of mass scales that are either @xmath74  tev or @xmath4 , and thus are unlikely to have any observable effects on stable matter at low energies .    _ avoiding stable charged exotic matter .",
    "_ we will now further restrict our charge assignments @xmath34 to assure that we have no stable heavy states that are charged under any of the standard model gauge factors .",
    "this allows us to evade bounds on stable charged matter from searches for anomalously heavy isotopes in sea water  @xcite . in both the exotic lepton and quark sectors",
    "separately , it is always possible to choose yukawa couplings such that one exotic state is lightest , and ordinary weak decays to this state are kinematically allowed .",
    "for example , the exotic lepton superpotential couplings ( in terms of left - handed chiral superfields ) @xmath75 lead to mass terms of the form @xmath76 where the @xmath77 are masses of order the u(1)@xmath28 breaking scale , while @xmath78 are of order the weak scale .",
    "here we have written the component superfields in the doublets @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) as @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "clearly one has the freedom to arrange for the lightest exotic lepton state to be neutral .",
    "for example , for the specific choice @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the lightest charged state has mass @xmath88 while the lightest neutral state @xmath89 ; we therefore could take @xmath90 . in the exotic quark sector , the lightest state is charged and colored , so some additional mechanism must be provided to assure it decays to ordinary particles . since we are working in the context of models in which the planck scale is low , we can make the lightest exotic quark unstable by considering possible higher - dimension operators , allowed by the symmetries of the theory and suppressed by the cutoff .",
    "as there is some freedom in how we may accomplish this , let us restrict our subsequent discussion to a specific example .",
    "let us choose the charge assignment in which @xmath91 .",
    "the choice @xmath92 and @xmath93 is consistent with this condition , and also allows the superpotential operator @xmath94 where lower - case superfields are those of the standard model .",
    "this operator allows for three - body decays for the lightest exotic quark field ( for example , to a normal lepton and two squarks ) .",
    "even if the superpartners are heavy , so that this decay is not kinematically allowed , one can obtain a four - fermion operator by `` dressing '' eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdimop ] ) with a gaugino exchange . in this case",
    ", the decay proceeds to two quarks and a lepton , with a width of order @xmath95 the first factor is from three - body phase space , the second from the fact that the amplitude occurs at one - loop , and the rest follows from dimensional analysis .",
    "the lightest exotic quark decays well before nucleosynthesis providing that @xmath96  gev ; this is not a problem in our scenario .",
    "note that the charge assignments @xmath92 and @xmath93 assure that potentially dangerous mass mixing terms like @xmath97 , and @xmath98 have u(1)@xmath28 charges of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "since this is not an integral multiple of @xmath101 ( the magnitude of the exotic higgs u(1)@xmath28 charges ) such operators are forbidden by the gauge symmetry .",
    "we will adopt the present choice of @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the subsequent discussion .",
    "however , the reader should keep in mind that other possible assignments may render the exotic matter unstable , given the presence of higher - dimension operators at the relatively low cutoff of the theory .",

    "since we wish to restrict our discussion to models that satisfy @xmath19 , we fix our remaining degree of freedom by imposing this constraint .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath107 for the ordinary matter , where the overall factor of @xmath108 is the multiplicity due to color and number of generations . for the exotic matter ,",

    "hence , the orthogonality of u(1)@xmath28 and hypercharge is maintained .",
    "notice that our choice for @xmath104 and @xmath105 is such that no dangerous mass mixing terms between exotic and standard model leptons are generated after u(1)@xmath28 is spontaneously broken .",
    "now that all our charges have been fixed , we summarize them here for convenience : @xmath113    _ symmetry breaking_. it is customary in model building to avoid discussing the origin of symmetry breaking scales , given the model - dependence that this issue often entails .",
    "here we only aim to emphasize that the scale of u(1)@xmath28 breaking may be tied quite naturally to the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this point is worth mentioning given that we have constructed our model specifically to allow for the decoupling of the nonstandard sector , to avoid bounds from precision electroweak measurements .",
    "one way in which the supersymmetry breaking and u(1)@xmath28 scale may be related is if the potential for the nonstandard higgs fields @xmath59 and @xmath60 develops its vacuum expectation value as a consequence of a soft scalar squared mass running negative , the analog of the radiative breaking scenario in the mssm .",
    "this scenario can be implemented in the present context since the exotic higgs fields couple to a sector of new matter fields with large yukawa couplings .",
    "the exotic higgs fields have the superpotential coupling @xmath114 the analog of the @xmath115 term in the mssm . introducing soft supersymmetry breaking masses , and @xmath116-terms , the scalar potential for the exotic higgs fields",

    "it is straightforward to show that this potential has stable ( local ) minima in which one scalar squared mass is negative and both @xmath59 and @xmath60 acquire vacuum expectation values .",

    "another possible form for the potential is that of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model , in which both the ordinary @xmath115 parameter and the parameter @xmath131 could have a common origin , the vev of a singlet field .",
    "we will not study the issue of possible potentials any further here , though such an investigation would be required if experimental evidence for the model became available .",

    "i.e. _ the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) , is reduced . as a consequence , the branching fraction to leptons @xmath162 is highly suppressed throughout the parameter space in fig .  [ figure1 ] . here",
    "@xmath163 is the number of quarks lighter than @xmath164 . in fig .",
    "2 we show contours of constant @xmath165b ; note that @xmath165b vanishes when @xmath166 .",
    "the cdf bound on this product in no stronger than @xmath167  pb for dilepton invariant masses above @xmath168  gev , and is significantly weaker for smaller masses  @xcite ; as a consequence , no additional bound can be placed on our parameter space .",
    "it is possible , however , that a dilepton signal could be discerned at run ii , if the @xmath10 were already discovered in the dijet channel .",
    "for example , for @xmath169  gev , where the current bound is @xmath167  pb , a simple rescaling by @xmath153 suggests that the bound could become @xmath170  pb after @xmath171  fb@xmath155 of integrated luminosity . the results in fig .  2",
    "imply that this would be sufficient to see the model s tiny dilepton signal .",
    "= 2.75 in    _ kk - modes_. the @xmath10 phenomenology we have discussed thus far has related to the zero - mode gauge field , and is independent of how the model is configured in extra dimensions . as we mentioned earlier , if all the non - chiral fields propagate in the bulk , then the first @xmath10 kk mode is outside the reach of the tevatron , and the zero - mode is of principle interest to us . here , we wish to consider an alternative possibility , that the compactification scale is low enough such that the first few kk modes are also within the kinematic reach of the tevatron .",
    "this can be the case if only u(1)@xmath28 and its associated exotic higgs fields live in the bulk .",
    "the usual strong bounds on @xmath132 are evaded in this situation since there are _ no _ exotic higgs fields charged under both u(1)@xmath28 and any of the standard model electroweak gauge factors  the vev of such a field would lead to mixing at tree - level between the @xmath142 and @xmath10 kk modes . in order to determine the relevant bounds , let us consider the following terms in the @xmath10 lagrangian : @xmath172 notice that the kk modes have contributions to their masses from both the symmetry breaking and the compactifaction scale . if @xmath173 , there is effectively a ` pile - up ' of states with masses of order @xmath139 and multiplicity @xmath174 .",
    "this is one way in which low - energy bounds are enhanced .",
    "in addition , the coupling of the kk modes to quarks has an extra factor of @xmath175 compared to the coupling of the zero mode ; this results from the field rescalings necessary to put the four - dimensional kinetic terms in canonical form , and to give the zero - mode gauge coupling its conventional normalization .",
    "hence , the appropriate dijet bound on a given kk mode may be obtained from fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] by scaling down the exclusion limit shown by a factor of @xmath176 . in the range shown in figure  [ figure1 ] is small , and can be neglected in this discussion . ]",
    "if @xmath132 is sufficiently small , the zero mode and first few kk modes could be unobserved in run  i , but discovered at run  ii .",
    "we therefore consider whether @xmath132 can be small enough for this interesting situation to be obtained .",
    "aside from the kk modes that are within the reach of the tevatron , there is also an infinite tower of heavier modes that are integrated out of the low - energy theory .",
    "thus , the new physics manifests itself as a series of narrow resonances , together with effective contact interactions that lead to smoothly growing cross sections .",
    "we may use the bounds on four - quark contact interactions to bound the compactification scale . if we integrate out all the modes with mass @xmath177  tev ( the endpoint of the dijet invariant mass spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite ) we obtain operators of the form @xmath178 where @xmath179 , and @xmath180 corresponds to the first kk mode above @xmath181 .",

    "we plot eq .",
    "( [ eq : contactb ] ) for several values of @xmath132 in fig .  3 .",
    "the mild steps in these contours occur each time a kk mode becomes more massive than @xmath181 , and is included in the contact term .",
    "= 2.75 in    in the case where @xmath132 is small , we can also determine whether the pile - up of states at @xmath139 is significantly bounded by @xmath142-pole observables .",
    "the most stringent constraint for this type of model comes from the measurement of the @xmath142 hadronic width  @xcite , which is known to approximately @xmath186  @xcite .",
    "we include contributions from the z@xmath187 mixing  @xcite and from the one - loop @xmath188 vertex correction  @xcite .",
    "the total effect is given by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is found by solving eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) , and @xmath191 is a loop integral factor that can be found in ref .",
    "the sums appear linearly in eq .",
    "( [ zwidth ] ) since the effects of new physics appear in an interference term at lowest order .",
    "figure 4 shows the 2@xmath165 bound for several choices of @xmath132 , where the sum includes the first 1000 kk modes .",
    "generally , the bound obtained from the z hadronic width supersedes the one obtained from contact interactions . figs .  3 and 4 in conjunction with fig .  1",
    "show that the compactification scale @xmath132 can be made small enough so that the @xmath10 zero mode and first few kk excitations could be undetectable at run i and discovered at run ii , without requiring the coupling @xmath140 to be unexplicably small .",
    "for example , the parameter choice @xmath192 , @xmath193  gev , and @xmath194  gev is consistent with all our constraints .",
    "we have shown in this article that it is possible to construct viable models with a non - anomalous u(1 ) symmetry that is orthogonal to hypercharge and that preserves proton stability , a concern when the quantum gravity scale is low .",
    "while exotic chiral fields are required to cancel anomalies , we show that these fields may nonetheless be vector - like under the standard model subgroup , so that constraints from the @xmath8 parameter are evaded , and may appear in complete su(5 ) representations , so that power - law unification may be preserved .",
    "the new gauge boson and its kk excitations exhibit a high degree of leptophobia , which is only violated by kinetic mixing with hypercharge , which is small and calculable , given our assumed boundary conditions .",
    "if power - law unification is sacrificed , then one may consider the case in which only the extra u(1 ) lives in the bulk . in this case ,",
    "the most important bounds on the compactification scale come from processes associated with the exchange of the @xmath10 and its kk excitations , and were found to be relatively weak .",
    "this allows the @xmath10 and its first few kk modes to be within the kinematic reach of the tevatron . in both versions of the model , we considered bounds from collider searches for new particles decaying to dijets and dileptons , and , in the second case , bounds on the compactification scale from contact interactions and contributions to the z hadronic width . for gauge couplings comparable to that of hypercharge",
