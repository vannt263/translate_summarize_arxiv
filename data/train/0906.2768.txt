    "theorema egregium _ , it has become customary to make a clear distinction between the intrinsic properties of a closed surface @xmath2 , whether local quantities such as its gauss curvature k=  ,  where  r_1,r_2   are  the  principal  radii  of  curvature , or non - local quantities such as its area @xmath3 , which depend only on the metric , and extrinsic properties such as its mean curvature h= ( 1 r_1 + 1 r_2 )  , which is local , or its largest diameter @xmath4 , which is non - local , since these may depend on which particular embedding one adopts .    however , this distinction may break down if the embedding in question is _ rigid _ , that is unique . by theorems of weyl , pogorelov and others ( see @xcite ) , this is true of smooth 2-surfaces whose gauss curvature is everywhere positive ; then there exists , up to isometries , a unique isometric embedding into euclidean 3-space @xmath5 . since",
    "this embedding @xmath6 is given by three highly non - linear partial differential equations depending on the intrinsic metric , g_ij = _ i*x * ._j * x *  , the extrinsic quantities depend in a highly non - local fashion on the metric",

    "an example of a 2-surface with a patch of negative curvature that can be globally embedded into @xmath5 is given ( another simple example is a  donut \" like surface ) ; in the same reference it is also shown that if the 2-surface admits a @xmath1 action and the gaussian curvature is negative at a smooth fixed point of such action , then a vicinity of the fixed point can not be embedded , not even locally , into @xmath5 .",

    "an embedding in a lower dimensional space may , nevertheless , be possible",
    ". indeed it was shown by frolov that , for the kerr - newman case , a global embedding in @xmath111 is possible .",
    "herein , we have shown that a global and unique embedding in a 3-dimensional _ hyperbolic _ space is possible for all values of the angular momentum , in contrast with the embedding in euclidean 3-space , first described in @xcite , which is only global for @xmath112 .",
    "moreover we have shown that up to @xmath113 , the hyperbolic embedding can be fitted in a fundamental domain of the picard group , which is used to construct interesting quotients of hyperbolic space .",
    "recently , various physical properties of the double - kerr system were studied @xcite .",
    "one novel feature unveiled in these studies is that the angular velocity of the two black holes decreases as they are approached , keeping their mass and angular momentum fixed , for both the counter - rotating @xcite and co - rotating @xcite cases .",
    "this effect was interpreted as a consequence of the mutual rotational dragging of the black holes .",
    "the angular velocity decrease is visible in the horizon geometry , and therefore in its embedding in a higher dimensional space .",
    "although the effect of the angular velocity decrease is clearer in the euclidean embedding , it is also visible in the hyperbolic embedding exhibited herein . due to the existence of a strut which provides the force balance between the black holes ,",
    "there is a curvature singularity at one of the poles of the horizon and therefore the embedding ( both euclidean and hyperbolic ) is not global .",
    "other possible applications of the hyperbolic embedding are to kerr-(anti ) de sitter black holes and to a schwarzschild black hole immersed in a magnetic field . in the latter case",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a patch of negative gaussian curvature develops , near the equator , if the magnetic field parameter exceeds a certain limit .",
    "curiously , for a certain range of magnetic field values , the gaussian curvature of a kerr black hole immersed in a magnetic field becomes positive for all values of the angular momentum , and an embedding in @xmath45 is possible @xcite .",
