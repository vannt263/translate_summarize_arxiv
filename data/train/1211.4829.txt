    "hence , we may order the accuracy of the functionals studied here as cam - b3lyp @xmath168  b3lyp @xmath169  pbe @xmath169  lda . as one could expect for the rather spatially localized @xmath155-@xmath155  transitions  the hybrid b3lyp functional performs",
    "similarly well compared to the more sophisticated cam - b3lyp functional which includes an additional 46 % of long - range hf exchange .",
    "let us now consider the excitation energies and their energetic separations @xmath162  and @xmath163  computed by means of td - hf - srdft .",
    "using 100% of long - range hf exchange , irrespective of the choice of srlda or srpbe functionals , reduces the transition energies and enlarges their relative gaps @xmath162  and @xmath163  in comparison to the regular td - dft / lda and td - dft / pbe data , respectively .",
    "this is not only in line with the findings for ( cam-)b3lyp relative to lda and pbe but results also in a good agreement of td - hf - srdft with the hybrid functionals . clearly ,",
    "@xmath170  a.u .   is large enough to introduce a non - negligible part of hf exchange , since long - range effects do not appear to be significant in the @xmath155-@xmath155  excitations .",
    "the fact that td - mc - srpbegws and td - hf - srpbegws results are not equal elucidates that a non - negligible part of the two - electron interaction is indeed assigned to the long - range interaction and thus treated by the mcscf approach within the cas(10,10 ) active space .",
    "in accordance with fromager _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , total energy differences on the order of @xmath171 a.u .  between the ground - state hf - srpbegws and mc - srpbegws wave functions ,",
    "respectively , corroborate our conclusion . in passing ,",
    "we note that our td - mc - srpbegws data are in very good agreement with experiment with respect to both excitation energies and the relative energetic spacings @xmath167  of the three lowest electronic singlet @xmath155-@xmath155transitions .",
    "the largest deviation to experiment is for the third excited state ( located at 3.82 ev ) where all approaches studied here yield too low transition energies except for sacci which , not taking into account further geometry effects ( _ vide supra _ ) , slightly overshoots by + 0.21 ev . in summary ,",
    "based on the experimental references , our new td - mc - srpbegws method shows significantly enhanced performance compared to the multi - reference wave function sacci approach which yields only a moderate agreement with experiment both with respect to transition energies and their energetic separation @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , td - mc - srpbegws provides a valuable alternative to the otherwise well - performing hybrid ( cam-)b3lyp functionals as well as the model potential lb94 which was explored in the recent work by scuppa and co - workers @xcite .",
    "we report in the lower part of table [ fecp2-comparison - d - d ]  ct excitation energies computed at the td - hf , td - dft level employing lda , gga , b3lyp and cam - b3lyp functionals along with our td - hf / mc - srdft results .",
    "the experimental data refers to the maximum peak positions in the measured absorption spectrum of ferrocene .",
    "it is readily seen that the td - hf ct excitation energies are unacceptably high whereas the td - dft / lda and td - dft / pbe transitions are too close to the lower end of the visible spectrum . with the hybrid b3lyp",
    "functional , on the other hand , deviations from experiment are reduced to -0.41 and -0.48 ev for the first and second ct transitions , respectively , yielding excitation energies of 5.41 ev and 5.72 ev .",
    "this clearly indicates the importance of using an exact exchange energy , or at least a fraction of it , with regard to a more general description of ct states where the extent of exact exchange determines the _ partial _ correction of the  long - range \" self - interaction error intrinsically present for pure lda and gga - type functionals .",
    "the appropriate combination with a suitable correlation functional then leads to satisfying results as seen here for b3lyp . bearing this in mind ,",
    "the superior performance of cam - b3lyp compared to b3lyp with respect to the ligand - to - metal ct excitations might not be unexpected as cam - b3lyp comprises in addition to the 19% of full - range hf exchange energy ( b3lyp : 20% ) , 46% of the long - range exact exchange energy .",
    "although only a fraction of long - range hf exchange is used , fortuitous error cancellations in combination with an approximate correlation density - functional may lead to excellent results , where cam - b3lyp excitation energies at the triple-@xmath109  basis set level nearly coincide with the experimental solution data . turning to the oscillator strengths , they are too weak in all our calculations , which is probably a combination of basis set effects and the solvent effects on the experiments .",
    "+ a closer inspection of the ct transitions in table [ fecp2-comparison - d - d ]  further reveals that both td - dft / lda and td - hf predict the ct transitions in reversed order .",
    "this feature remains also in the picture predicted by our td - mcscf response calculations where the description of long - range and short - range dynamic correlation within the cas(10,10 )  space vastly improves the excitation energies , lowering them to 5.50 ev for the a@xmath164  and 6.24 ev for the e@xmath173  state while , at large , their relative gap ( in reversed order ) enlarges to 0.74 ev compared to 0.38 ev in experiment .",
    "the extended active orbital space treated within the sacci approach , on the other hand , seems to capture most of the important contributions to the ct transitions , thus illustrating the importance of short - range dynamic correlation .",
    "peaks are predicted closely spaced at 6.34 ev and 6.43 ev , respectively , though .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for the td - hf - srdft model with either the srlda or srpbegws functional . the straightforward inclusion of short - range dynamic correlation by means of the srdft functional , using @xmath170  a.u .",
    ", suffices in this context to recover the correct ct state order from the @xmath174  pure wave - function - based td - hf limit .",
    "in contrast to the local @xmath155-@xmath155  transitions ( see sec .",
    "[ d - d - trans ] )  we observe for the first ct state a large difference between the td - hf - srdft and td - dft / cam - b3lyp approaches which we ascribe mainly to different fractions of long - range hf exchange , which amounts to only 65% in cam - b3lyp , and more importantly , to missing long - range correlation in td - hf - srdft .",
    "the impact of describing the latter correlation type explicitly , within the mcscf model , is highlighted by our td - mc - srpbegws results .",
    "it lowers the first e@xmath173  transition by 0.35 ev compared to td - hf - srpbegws while the second main ct peak is pushed upwards to 7.04 ev , thus overshooting the experimental reference by @xmath175 ev .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the second ct transition is , within both the td - mcscf and td - mc - srpbegws approaches , fully described by orbital rotations whereas the optically allowed e@xmath173  transition is largely obtained by configuration rotations .",
    "however , one can not make any final conclusions about the quality of the td - mc - srpbegws results compared to experiments before the solvent effects have been included in the calculations . work on this is currently in progress .",
    "computing high - level gas phase cc excitation energies would also be interesting for benchmarking .",
    "+ to sum up , our new proposed td - mc - srdft model has promising potential to accurately describe not only local excitations as shown for example for the @xmath155-@xmath155  transitions in sec .",
    "[ d - d - trans ]  but also to simultaneously model charge transfer excitations and their corresponding relative oscillator strengths .",
    "it exhibits in particular improved performance compared to both td - dft based on pure density - functionals and td - mcscf . in contrast to the latter approach , the srpbegws functional combined with a long - range td - mcscf treatment is able to describe short - range dynamic correlations and enables to get the two ct states in predicted order .",
    "the relative energy difference between the two ct states seems too large , though , when compared to experimental data .",
    "this might be due to self - interactions errors induced by the employed short - range functionals where the formers could be reduced choosing a different separation of short - range exchange and correlation energies .",
    "work is currently in progress in this direction .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of solvation effects by means of a polarizable embedded framework into the td - mc - srdft and td - dft response approaches @xcite of the dalton2011 program framework will facilitate future comparison to experimental works recorded in solution .",
    "finally , we note that the td - mc - srdft scheme seems to be a viable alternative to td - dft / cam - b3lyp where , in the former case , long - range correlation effects are described at the mcscf level .",
    "further calibration studies focusing particularly on such a direct comparison are being prepared .",
    "the extension of multi - determinant range - separated dft to the time - dependent regime has been investigated . following vignale  @xcite ,",
    "an exact variational formulation was obtained .",
    "various approximate schemes can then be formulated , depending on the choice of the post - hf method that is used for describing the long - range interaction , and the choice of the exchange - correlation functional used for treating the short - range interaction . in this work ,",
    "the combination of long - range mcscf with short - range adiabatic lda and gga was considered .",
    "the corresponding linear response scheme , referred to as td - mc - srdft , was then derived within floquet theory .",
    "numerical results obtained for the singlet excited states of the stretched h@xmath0 molecule and be show that td - mc - srdft can , in contrast to regular td - dft , describe double excitations even though the adiabatic approximation is used for the short - range exchange - correlation density - functional contributions .",
    "this is made possible by the mcscf - type parametrization of the wave function where , in addition to orbital rotations , configuration rotations inside the active space can be treated explicitly .",
    "for the commonly used @xmath132 range - separation parameter value , excitation energies are , in most cases , much better described with td - mc - srdft than regular td - dft .",
    "huge improvements are also observed , when comparing with the td - dmft - srlda results of pernal  @xcite , in the description of the @xmath1 doubly - excited state of be and the @xmath2 state of the stretched h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "still , in the latter case , excitation energies are significantly underestimated .",
    "the error is due to the approximate short - range lda and gga potential and kernel that are used .",
    "increasing @xmath5 improves on the accuracy but then some part of the short - range electron correlation is transferred from dft to the mcscf .",
    "this is of course not appealing , in terms of computational cost , for larger scale calculations . as an alternative",
    ", a different decomposition of the short - range exchange and correlation energies  @xcite could be used while keeping the @xmath5 parameter set to @xmath112  a.u .",
    "work is currently in progress in this direction .",
    "the accuracy of the td - mc - srdft approach using a short - range gga functional was further examined for the low - lying singlet excited states of the @xmath154  metallocene ferrocene .",
    "excitation energies as well as energetic state separations are in overall good agreement with experiment for both valence and charge - transfer excitations apart from a single outlier .",
    "td - mc - srdft generally outperforms traditional wave - function and td - dft approaches with exception of td - dft / cam - b3lyp that yields comparable results with a better performance for the charge - transfer states .",
    "the latter functional was specifically designed to remedy known shortcomings of td - dft @xcite for this excitation class , though .",
    "extensive works with the overall aim to shed further light on weaknesses and strengths of our proposed td - mc - srdft approach with respect to td - dft / cam - b3lyp are therefore in progress .",
