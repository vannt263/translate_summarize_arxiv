    "the rapid time variabilities and the compactness problem ( see , e.g. , a review by piran 1999 ) suggest that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) should arise from internal shocks within relativistic flows . in the standard model a strong magnetic field",
    "is generated , and electrons are fermi - accelerated in shocked regions . because of the high lorentz factor of the flows , synchrotron radiation by accelerated electrons is blue - shifted , and observed as gamma - ray photons .",
    "the physical conditions in the shocked region imply @xcite that protons may be also fermi - accelerated to energies @xmath0 ev .",
    "if the total energy of protons , accelerated over the energy range @xmath1-@xmath2 ev , is comparable to the energy of the gamma - rays , it can explain the flux of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "this is an attractive idea for the cosmic - ray source .",
    "high energy protons in the grb photon field can create high - energy neutrinos via photopion production @xcite .",
    "if the above prediction is true , a @xmath3 neutrino detector may detect neutrinos correlated with grbs in the near future @xcite .",
    "however , if the proton photopion `` optical depth '' is much higher than unity , protons lose their energies in grb sources . in this case grbs can not be the sources of uhecrs .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter at03 ) analytically show that high - energy protons cool rapidly via photopion production for fiducial parameters in grb physics and that most of the proton energy converts to photons via @xmath4 decay , pion synchrotron , muon synchrotron , and the electromagnetic cascade of electron - positron pairs .    in this paper , using the monte carlo method",
    ", we simulate numerically the proton cooling and resulting neutrino emission in order to confirm quantitatively whether grbs can be sources of uhecrs or not .",
    "our method pursues energy loss processes of each nucleon interacting with photons and the magnetic field during the dynamical timescale .",
    "therefore , we can treat energy loss processes correctly even in the case that a nucleon creates pions multiple times in the dynamical timescale .",
    "@xcite carried out similar calculations using a different method from ours .",
    "our purpose is to obtain a physical condition to produce uhecrs , while @xcite mainly discussed neutrino production . in ",
    "2 we explain our model and method .",
    "the physical situation we consider is clearly shown .",
    "the numerical results are in  3 .",
    "an analytically detailed description of the results can be found in at03 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "we simulate nucleon cooling in the grb photon field by the monte carlo method .",
    "we adopt a relatively low grb energy and a small magnetic field for uhecr production to be as advantageous as possible .",
    "the situation we consider is as follows .    in the standard model gamma - ray photons",
    "are emitted from shocked shells moving with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , a review by piran 1999 ) . in most cases the observed isotropic energies of grbs are larger than @xmath6 ergs @xcite , and the number of pulses per burst is less than @xmath7 @xcite . according to the above facts , we consider one shell of @xmath8 , in which gamma - ray photons are produced , and the total energy of those photons is @xmath9 ergs in spherical symmetry .",
    "the shell width is constrained by the observed variability time - scale , @xmath10 ms , and the duration time , @xmath11 s. therefore , we assume that the shell width in the shell rest frame @xmath12 is in the range of @xmath13-@xmath14 cm .",
    "this implies the average luminosity @xmath15-@xmath16 ergs @xmath17 .",
    "the photon energy density @xmath18 in the shell rest frame depends on the radius @xmath19 where an internal shock occurs . in order to accelerate protons to energies",
    "@xmath0 ev , the internal shocks should occur at radii @xmath20 cm @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider cases with @xmath21 cm only .",
    "the energy density of magnetic field @xmath22 is assumed to be @xmath23 .    in our simulation , adopting the typical observed grb spectra , the photon number density in the energy range @xmath24 in the shell rest frame is set at @xmath25 for 1 ev @xmath26 1 kev and @xmath27 for 1 kev @xmath28 mev .",
    "the break energy 1 kev corresponds to 300 kev in the observer frame . for @xmath29 ev the synchrotron self absorption may be crucial @xcite , while the pair absorption may be crucial for @xmath30 mev ( e.g. , see at03 ) .",
    "thus , we neglect photons in such energy regions .    since grbs are possible sources of uhecrs with enegies @xmath0 ev , we assume fermi accelerated protons are injected in the energy range of @xmath31-@xmath1 ev in the shell rest frame as @xmath32 .",
    "although the lowest energy of fermi - accelerated particles is unknown , it is natural to consider that accelerated protons are distributed to quite a lower energy .",
    "relativistic protons ( @xmath33 ) in the grb photon field create pions and lose their energies via photopion production . in the shell rest frame",
    "the photon distribution is isotropic .",
    "then , the time scale of photopion production , @xmath34 , is written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the cosine of the photon incident angle . from @xcite ,",
    "based on experiments , we approximate the photopion production cross section by a broken power - law profile as @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the photon energy in the proton rest frame . the energy of a photon is expressed as @xmath43 .",
    "secondary neutrons produced in the channel with isospin flip , @xmath44 , also create pions on almost the same time - scale as @xmath34 .",
    "we use equation ( [ tau ] ) for both protons and neutrons . in the @xmath45-approximation @xcite the creation ratio @xmath46 is @xmath47 . in the power - law target photon field , however , the ratio @xmath46 is close to @xmath48 @xcite , because the charged pion production rate increases away from the @xmath45-resonance .",
    "so , we adopt @xmath49 in this simulation . for simplicity the nucleon inelasticity is fixed as @xmath50 , and the process of multiple pion production , which enhances the nucleon cooling efficiency , is neglected .",
    "extremely high energy protons can cool via synchrotron radiation with the power per unit photon energy @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the synchrotron function @xcite .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath54 is determined from random numbers in our monte carlo simulation .",
    "the cooling time scale due to synchrotron radiation is @xmath55 .",
    "another possible mechanism of the proton cooling is inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "the scattering rate is obtained from the klein - nishina cross section @xmath56 @xcite by exchanging mass @xmath57 . in the proton rest frame , when an photon with energy @xmath58 is scattered , the energy of the scattered photon is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cosine of the scattering angle .",
    "the probability distribution of the scattering angle is @xmath61 the lorentz transformation yields the scattered photon energy @xmath62 in the shell rest frame .",
    "the cooling time - scale due to ic is @xmath63 where @xmath64 . to obtain @xmath65 ,",
    "the numerical integration is carried out with @xmath60 determined from equation ( [ p ] ) .",
    "this numerical integration process also gives the ic spectra at once .",
    "we pursue @xmath66 nucleons in each computation . given a nucleon energy , the cooling time scales @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath65 are determined .",
    "let us denote the cooling time scale due to photon emission by @xmath69 , which satisfies @xmath70 .",
    "assuming that nucleons interact with photons and the magnetic field during the dynamical time scale @xmath71 , we pursue the nucleon cooling process by a time step @xmath72 and @xmath73 for protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "the time step will change as nucleons lose their energies .",
    "the pion production probability in each time step is @xmath74 . if nucleons create charged pions , the species of the nucleons is changed ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "after @xmath76 s have passed , nucleons are considered to escape from the shell .",
    "the neutron - decay emissions will produce nonthermal emission signatures .",
    "however , we can distinguish those emissions from the prompt burst , since the flux of neutrinos and photons originated from the neutron - decay is faint because of the long decay time - scale .",
    "we do not discuss those emissions below .",
    "the time - scales @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath65 are proportional to @xmath77 , while the dynamical time - scale @xmath78 ( see at03 ) .",
    "the proton cooling process is determined by the ratios @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , which are proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the proton cooling process is independent of @xmath12 . under the situation we consider ,",
    "the proton cooling efficiency depends on the total photon energy @xmath83 and the radius @xmath84 , rather than on the luminosity @xmath85 .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the ratios @xmath86 for @xmath87 cm and @xmath9 erg . from the condition to create pions @xmath88 , the behavior of @xmath89",
    "is explained as follows . for @xmath90 ev , protons produce pions with photons whose energies are above the break energy @xmath91 kev [ @xmath92 . in this case",
    "the number of the interacting photons is proportional to @xmath93 , which implies @xmath94 . above @xmath95",
    "ev protons interact with photons in a low - energy region [ @xmath96 . as a result , @xmath97 is nearly constant in this energy region .",
    "it is easily confirmed that the simple approximation in @xcite , which was adopted in simulations in @xcite , produces a close value to our numerical estimate , @xmath97 .",
    "since @xcite adopted a very low energy , @xmath98 ergs for a shell , the pion production efficiency in their case becomes lower than ours . beyond @xmath99",
    "ev , the threshold energy of target photons to create pions is below the cut - off energy ( 0.3 kev in the observer frame ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath89 decreases above this energy .    for @xmath100 ev ,",
    "the proton synchrotron cooling dominates photopion production .",
    "although the photon energy density is larger than the magnetic energy density ( @xmath101 ) , ic emission is negligible because of the klein - nishina suppression .",
    "figure 1 indicates that all protons above @xmath102 ev may lose their energies for @xmath87 cm .",
    "the result of the numerical simulation shown in figure 2 is consistent with the above discussion",
    ". nucleons with energies @xmath103 ev are extinguished .",
    "the energy protons lose is mainly transferred to pions and synchrotron photons ( see table 1 ) . the highest energy protons ( @xmath104 ev ) cool via synchrotron radiation , so that the pion distribution has a break at @xmath105 ev .",
    "the low - energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum exhibits @xmath106 , as is usually seen in the fast cooling case @xcite .",
    "the weak peak at @xmath107 ev in the synchrotron spectrum may be due to low - energy protons whose photopion `` optical depth '' is small enough .",
    "the ic spectrum is complex because of the klein - nishina suppression .",
    "even for @xmath108 cm ( fig .",
    "3 ) , nucleons @xmath109 ev are depleted by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "figure 4 shows the case for @xmath110 cm . in this case",
    "grbs can be sources of uhecrs , although nucleons @xmath111 ev are reduced by the synchrotron cooling .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath89 is @xmath112 because of the low photon density .",
    "the highest energy protons create a few pions and lose a few tens of percent of their energies .      using the same method",
    ", we simulate behavior of charged pions and muons until they decay into positrons ( electrons ) and neutrinos .",
    "the life times of pions and muons , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , ( @xmath115 s and @xmath116 s are the life times of pions and muons at rest , respectively ) are independent of the shell width @xmath12 . therefore , the energies charged pions and muons lose before their decays depend on @xmath12 differently from the proton cooling .    when a pion decays @xmath117 , the energy fraction a muon obtains is @xmath118 .",
    "the rest of the energy goes to a neutrino .",
    "we assume that the energy of a muon at its decay will be shared equally by a positron ( electron ) , a neutrino , and an anti - neutrino .",
    "we neglect neutrinos due to neutron decay @xmath119 , whose time - scale is much longer than @xmath76 .",
    "figure 5 shows the resulting spectra of neutrinos and photons emitted by pions and muons for @xmath87 cm and @xmath120 cm .",
    "pions and muons above the energy where the life time is comparable to the cooling time @xmath69 or dynamical time @xmath76 ( waxman and bahcall 1997 ; at03 ) lose their energy before their decay .",
    "for @xmath87 cm and @xmath120 cm , one half of the initial energy of the pions is expended via synchrotron radiation , and muons also lose their energy via synchrotron ( @xmath121% ) and ic ( @xmath122% ) radiation .",
    "neutrinos are distributed as @xmath123 with a low- and high - energy cut - off .",
    "the high - energy cut - off is determined by the life - time and the cooling time of pions ( muons ) . since",
    "a larger @xmath12 leads to a lower @xmath124 , the high - energy cut - off is roughly proportional to @xmath125 ( see fig .",
    "wider shell decreases the contribution of ic photons in comparison with synchrotron radiation , because of the klein - nishina suppression .",
    "the low - energy cut - off is determined by the minimum energy of pions produced from protons , which depends on only @xmath84 , as was discussed in  3.1 .",
    "both the low - energy and high - energy cut - off increase roughly @xmath126 ( see fig .",
    "if we observe neutrinos from grbs , the spectra give us parameters such as @xmath12 and @xmath84 independently of gamma - ray observation .",
    "figure 8 shows the ratio of the neutrino energy to the initial proton energy ( @xmath127 ev at injection ) .",
    "for @xmath128 cm , @xmath11% of the proton energy will be converted to a neutrino burst .",
    "if we consider only muon neutrinos , which will be detected with a kilometer - scale detector , their energy fraction may be a few percent of the accelerated protons .",
    "this result is consistent with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "the neutrino energy is a part of the energy protons lose via photopion production and synchrotron radiation .",
    "the `` rest energy '' ( the energies of neutral pions , photons , electrons , and positrons ) will be converted to lower energy photons ( @xmath129 ev ) via electromagnetic cascades ( see at03 ) , because higher energy photons ( @xmath130 ev ) will be absorbed by electron - positron pair creation .",
    "the total energy of such photons is quite larger than the neutrino energy ( see fig .",
    "if the energy of fermi - accelerated protons above @xmath131 ev is comparable to the grb photon energy @xmath83 , the energy of protons @xmath132 ev is @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the energy of protons may be 1 - 5 @xmath83 . in any case",
    "the energy of nucleons above @xmath131 ev will be lost for @xmath134 cm .",
    "as long as the energy of uhecrs is assumed to be comparable to the grb energy , gamma - ray photons originating from protons may be a large contiribution to the grb photons .",
    "our simulations have shown that internal shocks should occur at radii @xmath135 cm to generate uhecrs , although siginificant grb pulses have shorter time - scales of @xmath136 s @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , neutrino bursts are expected for @xmath134 cm , while ultra - high - energy protons are depleted .",
    "the energy fraction of the neutrinos and neutrino spectra have been calculated for various @xmath84 and @xmath12 .",
    "neutrino spectra give us information on the physical condition of grbs , although only the most powerful bursts , which are brighter than @xmath137 erg or occur at @xmath138 , produce detectable neutrino bursts with a kilometer - scale detector @xcite .",
    "smaller @xmath83 and larger @xmath84 are favorable to generate uhecrs . at @xmath110 cm ,",
    "the most probable shell width is @xmath139 cm . in this case",
    "the magnetic field becomes @xmath140 g assuming @xmath9 ergs and @xmath101 .",
    "this strength seems rather weak to produce observed gamma - ray photons . since there are some unsolved problems and ambigious points in the theory of grb spectra @xcite , we have simply adopted a typical observed spectra without considering any physical conditions .",
    "it is challeging to find a condition to make both uhecrs and typical gamma - ray spectra be consistent .    to produce both uhecrs and a neutrino burst at the same time , the radius is limitted to around @xmath141 cm in our case .",
    "throughout this paper , we have adopted a relatively small grb energy @xmath9 ergs as an optimistic case . for brighter bursts ( @xmath142 ergs ) , stronger magnetic fields ( @xmath143 ) , and smaller lorentz factors ( @xmath144 )",
    ", internal shocks should occur at more distant radii to generate uhecrs .",
    "the threshold radius behaves as roughly @xmath145 under our assumption .",
    "if protons are accelerated to very high energies at both the internal shock phase and afterglow phase , both uhecrs and neutrino burst may be produced . in this case the neutrino bursts may be originated from internal shocks , while most of the uhecrs are produced at the afterglow phase . throughout this paper",
    "the internal shock model has been applied . however , the external shock model may be applicable for smooth profile grbs . according to @xcite ,",
    "the neutrino flux from individual grbs is far too weak in the external shock model , while neutrino bursts occur in the internal shock model as shown in this paper . in the external shock model , ultra - high - energy neutrons",
    "are produced and travel @xmath146 kpc before their numbers are depleted by @xmath147-decay .",
    "therefore , the external shock model predicts detection of neutron @xmath147-decay halo emission at optical and radio frequencies with luminosity @xmath148 ergs @xmath149 . on the other hand uhecrs",
    "may be extinguished for bright grbs in the internal shock model so that neutron @xmath147-decay halos are not generated .",
    "future neutrino , optical , and radio observations may provide tests of the two scenarios .",
    "measurement of ion composition of uhecrs from supernova remnants with instruments such as _ auger _ may be helpful for investigating the origin of uhecrs .",
    "neutrino bursts surely accompany gamma - ray photons originating from pion cascades . those photons may be not negligible in comparison with the `` original grb photons . '' in this case , as at03 discussed , grb photons may arise from pion cascades , rather than from initially existing electrons .",
