    "the process of self - organization of a structure may appear to be an antithesis of the maximum entropy _ ansatz _ , yet various nonlinear systems display what may be viewed as the simultaneous existence of order and disorder .",
    "this co - existence begins to make sense if the self - organization processes and the entropy principle were to manifest on different scales ; disorder can still develop at a microscopic scale while an ordered structure emerges on some appropriate macroscopic scale .",
    "writing a theory of self - organization , then , will be an exercise in delineating and understanding the characteristic _ scale hierarchy _ of the physical system .",
    "a biological body is a typical example in which an evident hierarchical structure is preprogrammed enabling effective consumption of energy and materials as well as emission of entropy and waste . a physical macro - system a collective system of simple elements ( a gravitational system , a plasma , etc.) is anchored on a different framework . an automatic emergence of scale hierarchy is not programmed ; yet",
    "the controlling nonlinear dynamics can mimic a fundamental process of _",
    "creation_.    in this paper we develop a new framework to expose the creation process in action .",
    "the ordering principle is generally epitomized in a constraint a possible conservation law that , by restricting the class of motions available to the system , limits its ability to degenerate into general disorder .",
    "the _ effective _ phase space ( ensemble ) limited by such a constraint is the relevant _ macro - hierarchy _ on which nontrivial structures emerge . by invoking the geometrical notion of hamiltonian mechanics ,",
    "we formulate a macro - hierarchy as a _ casimir leaf _ of foliated phase space , i.e. , the level - set of a _ _ casimir invariant__@xcite .",
    "the connection between the notion of scale hierarchy and a casimir invariant ( an _ a priori _ geometrical structure of the phase space ) is built by identifying a casimir invariant as an _",
    "adiabatic invariant _ ; the adiabaticity criterion , then , determines what is macro .",
    "after the microscopic action is separated , the macroscopic object , which we call a _ quasi - particle _ , resides on a casimir leaf .",
    "we will construct the boltzmann distribution of quasi - particles on a casimir leaf .",
    "the casimir invariant represents the number of quasi - particles , which is the determinant of the corresponding _ grand canonical ensemble_. interestingly , heterogeneity ( structure ) is created by the distortion of the metric ( invariant measure ) dictating _ equipartition _ on the leaf .",
    "basic physical mechanisms and processes , that embodies our general framework of describing macro - hierarchy and self - organization , will be brought to light via investigating a magnetospheric plasma .",
    "magnetospheric plasmas ( the naturally occurring ones such as the planetary magnetospheres@xcite , as well as their laboratory simulations@xcite ) are self - organized around the dipole magnetic fields in which charged particles cause a variety of interesting phenomena : the often observed _ inward diffusion _ ( or up - hill diffusion ) of particles injected from the outer region is of particular interest .",
    "this process is driven by some spontaneous fluctuations ( symmetry breaking ) that violate the constancy of angular momentum . in a strong enough magnetic field , the canonical angular momentum @xmath0 is dominated by the magnetic part @xmath1 : the charge multiplied by the flux function ( in the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 cylindrical coordinates , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the @xmath3 component of the vector potential ) .",
    "the conservation of @xmath7 , therefore , restricts the particle motion to the magnetic surface ( level - set of @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is only via randomly - phased fluctuations that the particles can diffuse across magnetic surfaces .",
    "although the diffusion is normally a process that diminishes gradients , numerical experiments do exhibit preferential inward shifts through random motions of test particles@xcite .",
    "detailed specification of the fluctuations or the microscopic motion of particles is not the subject of present effort .",
    "we plan to construct , instead , a clear - cut description of equilibria that maximize entropy simultaneously with bearing steep density gradients .",
    "such an equilibrium will be formulated as a grand canonical distribution on a leaf of foliated phase space that represents a macro - hierarchy . in a strongly inhomogeneous magnetic field ( typically a dipole magnetic field ) , the phase - space metric of _ magnetized particles _ is distorted ; thus the projection of the equipartition distribution onto the flat space of the laboratory frame yields peaked profile because of the connecting inhomogeneous jacobian weight .",

    ".    a general hamiltonian system may allow the poisson operator @xmath19 to be nontrivial ; it may be a function of @xmath28 , and moreover , may have a nontrivial kernel @xmath29 .",

    ", @xmath44 is the effective hamiltonian with the constraint restricting the casimir element @xmath31 to have a fixed value ( since @xmath31 is a constant of motion , its value is fixed at the initial value ) .",
    "even when a hamiltonian is simple , an energy - casimir functional may have a nontrivial structure .",
    "geometrically , @xmath44 is the distribution of @xmath41 on a casimir leaf ( a surface of @xmath45 constant ) .",
    "if casimir leaves are distorted with respect to the energy norm , the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 may have complex distribution on the leaf , which is , in fact , the origin of various interesting structures in noncanonical hamiltonian systems .",
    "the foliated phase space of a noncanonical hamiltonian system can be viewed as an ensemble of a constrained system a casimir invariant , representing the constraint , is often regarded as a `` charge '' of the system ( the conservation of charge is an _ a priori _ condition of dynamics , which is independent of the hamiltonian ) . to formulate the statistical mechanics for such a system , we consider a _ grand canonical ensemble _ determined by a total charge @xmath46 , in addition to the standard determinant , the total particle number @xmath47 and the total energy @xmath48 .",
    "the equilibrium is , then , the maximizer of the entropy @xmath49 under the constraints on the particle number @xmath50 , the energy @xmath51 , and the charge @xmath52 ; the variational principle @xmath53 yields a boltzmann distribution @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the normalization factor , @xmath57 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath58 is the _ chemical potential _ measuring the energy brought about by a change in the charge .",
    "[ remark - nambu ] one may interpret ( [ boltzmann - general ] ) as a boltzmann distribution with two different energies @xmath21 and @xmath59 ( with the corresponding inverse temperatures @xmath57 and @xmath60 ) . here , we remind the pioneering work of nambu@xcite , in which a similar grand canonical distribution function was derived for a `` generalized hamiltonian system '' with two hamiltonians on a @xmath61 configuration space the second hamiltonian corresponds to a casimir invariant in the present framework .",
    "how a density @xmath62 depends on the metric of the phase space ( @xmath15 dimensional ) is formulated by identifying it as a differential @xmath15-form ( or , an @xmath15-covector ) .",
    "it is essential to distinguish an extensive quantity @xmath62 and an intensive quantity @xmath63 ; the former ( latter ) is an @xmath15-form ( a 0-form ) ; the former transforms as [ with a jacobian weight @xmath64 @xmath65 while the latter is independent of the coordinate transformation .",
    "this is because @xmath66 ( instead of @xmath62 alone ) represents a physical number , and is exactly at the core of the calculus performed in the foregoing subsections .    in the theoretical foundation of statistical mechanics ,",
    "the _ invariant measure _ based on liouville s theorem ( corresponding to the poisson bracket of the system ) is of fundamental significance . a diffusion equation ( or , a collision operator ) , therefore ,",
    "must be formulated in consistency with the invariant measure .",
    "the equilibrium state is , then , given by maximizing entropy with respect to the invariant measure .",
    "given an invariant measure @xmath67 , the diffusion equation governing @xmath62 and @xmath63 are , respectively , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a diffusion coefficient , @xmath70 is the exterior derivative ( gradient ) and @xmath71 is the codifferential ( @xmath72 is the hodge star operator ) .",
    "thus , the diffusion of @xmath62 is a process of flattening @xmath73 , while that of @xmath63 is simply the flattening of @xmath63 .",

    ", we will see such an example of _ distorted metric _ caused by the inhomogeneity in the magnetic field ; instead of the conventional lebesgue measure of the flat galilean space , the flux - tube volume is invariant , and this is the root cause of the inward diffusion observed in magnetospheres ( for example , @xcite formulates a diffusion equation for the flux - tube density of a magnetospheric plasma ) .",
    "the diffusion of @xmath62 is caused by fluctuations that violate conservation of microscopic data ( initial conditions of each particle ) while conserving the macroscopic invariants that serve as the determinants of a statistical ensemble .",
    "what is highly nontrivial is that the diffusion ( occurring `` inward '' as demonstrated , for example , in an electron plasma@xcite ) is a process creating an inhomogeneous structure . in a flat ( homogeneous metric ) space ,",
    "the equilibrium state is just trivially stable , while the equilibrium associated with a distorted ( inhomogeneous ) metric remains stable because the _ free energy _ is constrained by the macroscopic constants .",
    "the free energy of a grand canonical system ( the logarithm of the grand canonical partition function ) is the sum of the internal energy @xmath48 and the coupled `` external '' energies ; the latter are measured by `` particle numbers '' multiplied by chemical potentials .",
    "in the foregoing argument , a casimir invariant was considered as an abstract constraint on a hamiltonian system ; whereas we called @xmath76 a total charge of a grand canonical ensemble , the physical meaning of such a charge has not been identified . in this section ,",
    "we study a concrete example in which a casimir invariant is equivalent to an adiabatic invariant .",
    "the physical meanings of the foliated phase space and the boltzmann distribution on it then become clear .      as an example of hamiltonian system that has a hierarchical structure in terms of adiabatic invariants@xcite , we study a plasma confined by a magnetic field , and by which we relate casimir invariants to adiabatic invariants .      here",
    "we consider an axisymmetric system with a poloidal ( but no toroidal ) magnetic field that can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath3 is the toroidal angle and @xmath8 is the magnetic flux function ( the gauss potential of @xmath78 ) .",

    "we can choose @xmath80 as the coordinates of the configuration space ( @xmath3 is ignorable in an axisymmetric system ) .",
    "for example , a point - dipole magnetic field is represented by @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the cylindrical coordinates and @xmath46 is the magnetic moment .",

    "for example , @xmath42 could be boosted by cyclotron heating ( for magnetically confined particles ) , and the resulting increase in the total magnetic moment of the system could cause macroscopic motion of the levitated magnet accompanied by the plasma@xcite . in our model ,",
    "an increase of @xmath42 means injection of quasi - particles ; an increased quasi - particle number @xmath46 , in turn , automatically increases the macroscopic magnetic moment .",
    "this simple picture is beyond the reach of the conventional canonical ( or micro - canonical ) distributions that are unaware of any direct relation between the macroscopic magnetic moment and @xmath42 [ even if we write @xmath201 as in ( [ boltzmann-2 ] ) ] .",
    "heating , therefore , could not create or destroy magnetic moment ( or any axial vector ) ; the coupling of heat and mechanical energy could manifest only through the pressure force .",
    "our distribution function , on the other hand , is capable of delineating such connections since it embodies magneto - fluid - thermo couplings .",
    "many other applications such as estimate of fluctuations , phase equilibrium relations , possible condensation at low temperature , etc . will become accessible through the grand canonical distribution .",
    "the framework we have developed will apply to general systems with nontrivial _",
    "topologies_. viewing from a different angle , our work has a common perspective with nambu s `` generalized hamiltonian system '' that has two hamiltonians ( one of which is a casimir invariant in the present terminology ) ; see @xcite and remark[remark - nambu ] . in the present theory ,",
    "connecting a casimir invariant further to an adiabatic invariant , we have written a kinetic - thermodynamic theory with a built in _",
    "scale hierarchy_. structure formation is a direct consequence of embedding the casimir leaf ( where the microscopic actions are abstracted as quasi - particle numbers ) into the laboratory flat space .",
    "we end this paper with some comments on self - organization in fluid - mechanical systems .",
    "the dynamics in some fluid models can be cast into a unified hamiltonian form@xcite @xmath202 where @xmath127 is a state vector belonging to a hilbert space @xmath14 , @xmath203 is the hamiltonian which is a real - valued functional on @xmath14 , and @xmath19 is the poisson operator .",
    "the poisson bracket is defined by @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the inner - product of @xmath14 .",
    "the vortex equation of two - dimensional eulerian ( inviscid , incompressible ) flow is the simplest example ; with a poisson operator @xmath206 $ ] ( where @xmath127 is the vorticity , and @xmath207= \\partial_y a \\cdot\\partial_x b - \\partial_x a \\cdot\\partial_y b$ ] ) , and a hamiltonian @xmath208 ( where @xmath209 is the two - dimensional laplacian , and @xmath210 is its inverse ) , ( [ hamilton - function_space ] ) reads @xmath211 $ ] , ( where @xmath212 is the gauss potential of the flow ) . notice that @xmath19 depends on the dynamical variable @xmath127 .",
    "evidently @xmath213 ( @xmath62 is an arbitrary @xmath214-class function ) is a casimir invariant .",
    "slightly modifying the poisson operator as @xmath215 $ ] with an inhomogeneous term @xmath118 ( cf.@xcite ) , and the hamiltonian as @xmath216 with @xmath217 ( the term @xmath218 in the operator @xmath95 reflects the compressibility of the fluid ) , hamilton s equation ( [ hamilton - function_space ] ) becomes @xmath219 $ ] with @xmath220 , which is formally the hasegawa - mima equation  @xcite of drift waves in a magnetized plasma ( @xmath118 represents the inhomogeneity of the equilibrium plasma density ) , or the charney equation  @xcite of rossby waves ( @xmath118 represents the inhomogeneity of the coriolis force and the depth of the atmospheric fluid ) .",
    "the casimir invariant is @xmath221 .",
    "+ a theory of self - organization can be described by invoking the scenario of _ selective dissipation _ which compares different constants of motion , the hamiltonian ( energy ) and some casimir invariants ( choosing @xmath222 , @xmath223 is the _ enstrophy _ ) ; a functional including higher - order spatial derivatives is more fragile in comparison with a lower - order one , because small - scale turbulence can dissipate it more easily , thus the energy conserves better than the enstrophy . minimizing the enstrophy for a fixed energy ,",
    "we obtain a `` relaxed state '' .",
    "the review paper by hasegawa@xcite describes a list of successful applications of this model , including the creation of zonal flows by rossby wave turbulence , and the taylor relaxed state@xcite by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence ( which dissipates the energy while conserving the magnetic helicity , a casimir invariant of mhd system ) .",
    "+ the same minimization principle has a different connotation , which aligns with the present theory .",
    "the target functional to be minimized is nothing but the energy - casimir functional ( see sec.[subsec : energy - casimir ] ) , thus the minimizer is an equilibrium point of the hamiltonian mechanics ( by the duality of well - posed variational principles@xcite , the minimizer of the enstrophy for a given energy is equivalent to the maximizer of the energy for a given enstrophy , and the latter is also an equilibrium point of the hamiltonian system ) . to put this equilibrium point into the perspective of the entropy principle",
    ", we have to consider statistical mechanics on a function space . in @xcite , a grand canonical ensemble of mhd",
    "is formulated by considering `` magnetic - helicity quantum . ''",
    "the taylor relaxed state is , then , the _ low - temperature limit _ ( ground state ) of the boltzmann distribution ( here , the _ temperature _ measures the strength of the turbulence ) .",
    "+ while the present theory of self - organization has wide applications encompassing particle models to fluid models , the connection between the two formalisms awaits further exploration .",
    "for example , the helicities are the determinants of the macroscopic hierarchy ( casimir leaf ) of the mhd system , which control the bifurcation of various equilibrium points by shifting the leaf in the phase space@xcite .",
    "however , we have not yet unearthed the coarse - grained `` angle variable '' corresponding to the magnetic helicity .",
    "if we can specify the origin of the fluid casimir invariants in the particle model , we will be able to write a kinetic theory of far richer structures that have various helicities ( or , vorticities and currents twisting the stream lines and magnetic field lines ) .",
    "+ the foliation is also an interesting subject to be explored in the framework of a new variable the entropy production rate .",
    "since , for a driven ( or open ) system , the standard entropy is no longer an effective state variable to characterize long - lived structures , the entropy production rate ( @xmath224 ) has been deemed to be an alternative determinant of the state .",
    "debates have raged whether the organizing principle is the minimum or maximum of @xmath224 . while the minimum @xmath224 principle@xcite applies to linear systems , typical nonlinear fluid - mechanical systems , instead prefer maximum @xmath224 states .",
    "sawada@xcite proposed a nonlinear mechanism that maximizes @xmath224 ; for other models of fluids and plasmas , see.@xcite .",
    "dewar@xcite proposed to evaluate the probability of phase - space trajectories ( instead of points ) , which is shown to have a boltzmann distribution by replacing the minus energy by the entropy production along each trajectory ; hence the maximum entropy production is most probable ( see also @xcite for the thermodynamic duality of the maximum and minimum principles that switch depending on whether the system is flux driven or force driven ) .",
    "when the phase space is foliated , such trajectories must be restricted on a casimir leaf , and then the structures self - organized by maximizing @xmath224 will have topological complexity charged by the casimir invariants .",
