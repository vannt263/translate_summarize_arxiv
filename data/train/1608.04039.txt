    "boswijk , franses , and haldrup ( 1997 ) limit their scope to finite order seasonal ar data and apply johansen s method ( 1988 ) .",
    "however , their approaches can not directly test the existence of a certain root without first checking the number of seasonal unit roots . as a remedy ,",
    "ghysels , hall , and lee ( 1996 ) designs a wald test that directly tests whether a certain root exists .",
    "however , in their own simulation , the wald test turn out less powerful than the augmented hegy test .",
    "does hegy test work in the seasonally heterogeneous setting ? to the best of our knowledge , no literature has offered a satisfactory answer .",
    "burridge and taylor ( 2001a ) analyze the behavior of augmented hegy test when only seasonal heteroscadasticity exists ; del barrio castro and osborn ( 2008 ) put augmented hegy test in the periodic integrated model , a model related but different from model .",
    "no literature has ever touched the behavior of unaugmented hegy test proposed by breitung and franses ( 1998 ) , the important semi - parametric version of hegy test . since unaugmented hegy test does not assume the noise having an ar structure , it may suit our non - parametric noise in better .    to check the legitimacy of hegy tests in the seasonally heterogeneous setting",
    ", this paper derives the asymptotic null distributions of the unaugmented hegy test and the augmented hegy test whose order of lags goes to infinity .",
    "it turns out that , the asymptotic null distributions of the statistics testing single roots at 1 or @xmath1 are standard .",
    "more specifically , for each single root at 1 or @xmath1 , the asymptotic null distributions of the augmented hegy statistics are identical to that of augmented dickey - fuller ( adf ) test ( dickey and fuller , 1979 ) , and the asymptotic null distributions of the unaugmented hegy statistics are identical to those of phillips - perron test ( phillips and perron , 1988 ) . however , the asymptotic null distributions of the statistics testing any combination of roots at 1 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 depend on the seasonal heterogeneity parameters , and are non - standard , non - pivotal , and not directly pivotable .",
    "therefore , when seasonal heterogeneity exists , both augmented hegy and unaugmented hegy tests can be straightforwardly applied to single roots at 1 or @xmath1 , but can not be directly applied to the coexistence of any roots .    as a remedy",
    ", this paper proposes the application of bootstrap . in general , bootstrap s advantages are two fold .",
    "firstly , bootstrap helps when the asymptotic distributions of the statistics of interest can not be found or simulated . secondly ,",
    "even when the asymptotic distributions can be found and simulated , bootstrap method may enjoy second order efficiency .",
    "for the aforementioned problem , bootstrap therefore serves as an appealing solution .",
    "firstly , it is hard to estimate the seasonal heterogeneity parameters in the asymptotic null distribution , and to simulate the asymptotic null distribution .",
    "secondly , it can be conjectured that bootstrap seasonal unit root test inherits second order efficiency from bootstrap non - seasonal unit root test ( park , 2003 ) .",
    "the only methodological literature we find on bootstrapping hegy test is burridge and taylor ( 2004 ) .",
    "their paper centers on seasonal heteroscadasticity , designs a bootstrap - aided augmented hegy test , reports its simulation result , but does not give theoretical justification for their test .",
    "it will be shown ( remark [ re : seasonal iid bootstrap ] ) that their bootstrap approach is inconsistent under the general seasonal heterogeneous setting .    to cater to the general heterogeneous setting",
    ", this paper designs new bootstrap tests , namely 1 ) seasonal iid bootstrap augmented hegy test , and 2 ) seasonal block bootstrap unaugmented hegy test . to generate bootstrap replicates , the first test get residuals from season - by - season augmented hegy regressions , and then applies seasonal iid bootstrap to the whitened regression errors .",
    "on the other hand , the second test starts with season - by - season unaugmented hegy regressions , and then handles the correlated errors with seasonal block bootstrap proposed by dudek , lekow , paparoditis , and politis ( 2014 ) .",
    "our paper establishes the functional central limit theorem ( fclt ) for both bootstrap tests .",
    "based on the fclt , the consistency for both bootstrap approaches is proven . to the best of our knowledge",

    "<S> both seasonal unit roots and seasonal heterogeneity are common in seasonal data . when testing seasonal unit roots under seasonal heterogeneity , it is unclear if we can apply tests designed for seasonal homogeneous settings , i.e. the hegy test ( hylleberg , engle , granger , and yoo , 1990 ) . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the validity of both augmented hegy test and unaugmented hegy test is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic null distributions of the statistics testing the single roots at @xmath0 or @xmath1 turn out to be standard and pivotal , but the asymptotic null distributions of the statistics testing any coexistence of roots at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 are non - standard , non - pivotal , and not directly pivotable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the hegy tests are not directly applicable to the joint tests for the concurrence of the roots . as a remedy , </S>",
    "<S> we bootstrap augmented hegy with seasonal independent and identically distributed ( iid ) bootstrap , and unaugmented hegy with seasonal block bootstrap . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of both bootstrap procedures is established . </S>",
    "<S> simulations indicate that for roots at @xmath0 and @xmath1 seasonal iid bootstrap augmented hegy test prevails , but for roots at @xmath4 seasonal block bootstrap unaugmented hegy test enjoys better performance .    </S>",
