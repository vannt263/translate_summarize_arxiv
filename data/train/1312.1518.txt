    "<S> nowaday the most popular and the most cited of the various theories of glasses are based on mean  field replica approach @xcite and the so called random first order transition theory ( rfot ) @xcite , both based on analogies with the well - developed equilibrium statistical mechanics of spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> numerous results were obtained in the framework of the so - called mode - coupling theory ( mct ) ( see , e.g. , the pioneering work @xcite , the review @xcite , and also the detailed presentation in the recent monograph @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> although to - day the investigations of dynamical heterogeneities ( see e.g. @xcite ) in glassy systems make favourable the different variants of overrunning mct , one can affirm that it was for a long time the only consistent theory describing details of the transitions in supercooled liquids . </S>",
    "<S> despite suffering of a shift of the actual glass transition value , mct provides a good description of the experimental data . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we remain in the frame of the traditional mct .    in the framework of mct </S>",
    "<S> , we propose the qualitative description of liquid - glass and glass - glass transitions in a system of hard spheres with an additional repulsive step in the potential ( square - shoulder ( ss ) system ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mct equations demonstrate the @xmath0 bifurcation singularities and @xmath1 end points . in the framework of the approximation @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the quasibinary nature of the ss system @xcite , we show that there is some symmetry of the mct equations , which leads to the duplication of singularities . </S>",
    "<S> as far as we know , the double swallow tail is described in the present paper in the first time .    in mct </S>",
    "<S> , the system dynamics is described in terms of the autocorrelation function of the density fluctuations @xmath2 well known in the theory of liquids ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . here , @xmath3 is the fourier transform of the system density . </S>",
    "<S> the autocorrelation function satisfies the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is white noise and @xmath6 the characteristic frequency . </S>",

    "<S> these two quantities are related : @xmath12 the behavior of the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) at large times determines relaxation processes in the system @xcite . as @xmath13 , the algebraic equation for the limit correlation function @xmath14 : @xmath15 can be obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) always has the trivial solution @xmath16 corresponding to the liquid ( ergodic ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) can also have a nonzero solution @xmath17 corresponding to a nonergodic glass phase . if @xmath16 is a bifurcation point of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) the liquid - glass transition is continuous , if no , then @xmath18 changes jumpwise from zero to a certain value @xmath19 at the transition point . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the value @xmath18 can be regarded as an order parameter ( or a nonergodicity parameter ) for the liquid - glass transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the mct was first used to describe the transition to the glass state in the system with the hard - core potential in @xcite and then in a large number of various systems . </S>",
    "<S> its applicability was confirmed experimentally ( see @xcite ) . at the same time , papers where the possibility of describing the glass - glass transition for certain potentials in the mct framework have recently appeared : in this case , the glass characterized by the nonergodicity parameter @xmath20 transforms jumpwise into another glass with the nonergodicity parameter @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition was predicted for systems with a potential consisting of a solid core and a very narrow and deep attractive well in @xcite . in this case , the first glass state is determined by repulsion as for the system of hard spheres , while the second glass state is determined by attraction . </S>",
    "<S> it is the competition between these two states that determines the glass - glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> the glass - glass transition line continues the liquid - glass transition line smoothly to the glass region and ends at a third - order bifurcation point .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider a system in which the attracting well is changed for a repulsive step - ss system . </S>",
    "<S> this system and its smoothed versions were widely studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that a series of unusual phenomena are observed in the system , including maxima on the melting curve and structural transitions in the solid phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , thermodynamic anomalies like ones observed in water were discovered in the system with a smoothed version of the potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential of the system under consideration has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the diameter of the hard core and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the diameter and height of the repulsive step . in the papers @xcite the mct equations obtained for this system using different approximations for the static structure factor </S>",
    "<S> were solved numerically and slightly different results were obtained , drastically depending on the approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that all the variants of the structure factor used in the mentioned papers have an obvious common feature : the first peak , corresponding to the diameter of the repulsive step , decreases with the increase of the density , and the second peak , determined by the hard core , increases . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we try to demonstrate the main features of this quasibinary system in the frame of a very simple approximation for the structure factor @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the positions of the first and second maxima of the structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are determined by the area under the corresponding maxima @xcite . as it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this approximation works well for low densities and gives qualitatively correct result for the high density region . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to obtain a schematic phase diagram in terms of three control parameters @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    substituting approximation ( [ 8 ] ) in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) , we obtain an approximate system of equations for the nonergodicity parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37    the system can be considered as a mixture of hard spheres with diameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen @xcite , that the glass consisting of particles with the larger diameter @xmath24 exists for small densities , while the glass consisting of hard spheres with the diameter @xmath23 prevails for high densities . </S>",
    "<S> if these two types of local glass structure are taken into account , then the question arises , whether the glass - glass transition between these states exists . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an analysis of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 9 ] ) shows that there is a fourth - order singularity point @xmath0 for this system . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity corresponds to the division of the space of three control parameters into three parts corresponding to the absence of nontrivial solution of the equations , to the part with two solutions , and the remaining part with four solutions , by the surface of the figure called `` swallow tail '' ( see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our approximation emphasizes the quasibinary nature of the system and enables one to obtain a qualitative phase diagram of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation leads to the new kind of the symmetry of the equations and to a degeneracy , both having a physical ground . </S>",
    "<S> the duplication of the singularities demonstrates one of the consequences of the degeneracy - we obtain `` double swallow tail '' .    despite a lot of works ( see , for example , @xcite ) where the higher order singularities in the mct were discussed , the degenerate cases and the multiplication of singularities were not considered in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that although our results are of qualitative character , the obtained picture can be considered in as a scenario for `` the ideal glass - glass transition '' in quasibinary systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we now pass directly to the problem of finding the bifurcation points of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 9 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known ( see , e.g. @xcite ) the uniqueness of solution of two functional equations @xmath38 fails at the points where the determinant of derivarives @xmath39 is zero .    </S>",
    "<S> let us use the standard mct notations ( see @xcite ) and rewrite the system ( [ 9 ] ) in the following form : @xmath40 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{f_2}{1-f_2 } & = & x ( a f_1+b f_2)^2   [ = f_2 ] , \\label{eq / pg1/1:swal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it is easy to see that these equations are invariant under the transformation    @xmath41 @xmath42    this means that for every solution of ( [ eq / pg1/1:swal ] ) there will be another one and the same can be said about every point @xmath43 .    at the bifurcation points we have @xmath44|| = 0 $ ] , where @xmath45    here @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ; @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> ; @xmath49 .    the determinant @xmath50 , and this fact is the consequence of the mentioned degeneracy . in fact , the matrix @xmath51 eigenvalues in our case are : @xmath52 and the bifurcation condition can be written in the form @xmath53    to find the points of bifurcation of the system it is technically convenient to use the new variable defined as follows : @xmath54    the equations ( [ eq / pg1/1:swal ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> now @xmath56 so that @xmath57    the derivative of this equation relative to @xmath55 gives @xmath58    this equation coincides with the bifurcation condition ( [ eq / pg1/2:swal ] ) , if one takes into account that @xmath59 now the problem of obtaining the bifurcation points of initial equations reduces to the system of equations ( [ eq / pg1/3:swal])-([eq / pg2/1:swal ] ) , that is the equations @xmath60 with @xmath61    let us make two remarks . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is easy to see that the point @xmath62 is not a bifurcation point of our equations , so that one can use @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 for our purpose . </S>",
    "<S> second , as far as the bifurcation properties are concerned it is possible to consider only the numerator as the main functional . all the equations for singularities ( including higher orders ) for these functionals will differ only by additive terms proportional to the lower order derivatives , which are zero . </S>",
    "<S> so , we can use the following functional : @xmath65 we have for the @xmath66 singularities : @xmath67 for the @xmath1 singularities : @xmath68 and for the @xmath0 singularity : @xmath69 while @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> the explicit forms for these derivatives are :    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    and @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> technically it is convenient to proceed in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> the equations ( [ eq / pg2/3:swal ] ) with ( [ eq / pg2/2:swal ] ) and ( [ eq / pg3/1:swal ] ) are two linear equations for the variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 which can be easily solved : @xmath77    substituting of these @xmath75 and @xmath76 in ( [ eq / pg3/2:swal ] ) and ( [ eq / pg3/3:swal ] ) gives ;    @xmath78    and @xmath79    the points @xmath80 ( at fixed values of @xmath81 ) for which there are some real solutions @xmath82 satisfying both of the equations ( [ eq / pg3/4:swal ] ) make the lines of points @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at the fixed value of @xmath81 and the set of @xmath75 the first of the equations ( [ eq / pg3/4:swal ] ) was solved . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained value of @xmath55 at the fixed @xmath81 then give value of @xmath76 through the second equation ( [ eq / pg3/4:swal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> those points ( @xmath83 ) for which in addition to the existence of @xmath55 , the values @xmath81 and @xmath55 are related through ( [ eq / pg3/5:swal ] ) , present the line of @xmath1 singularity .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these lines are related to jumpwise glass - glass transitions . </S>",
    "<S> so , due to symmetry property we obtain two swallow tails for the surfaces of @xmath66 singularities and two @xmath0 singularities . </S>",

    "<S> this gives @xmath109 and @xmath110 - the ergodic ( liquid ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> if we take into account the maximum principle for the bifurcated functions @xcite , we have to discard some parts of the swallow tails as a phase boundary : the almost horizontal line for the first swallow - tail singularity and almost vertical line for the second one .     </S>",

    "<S> one can imagine that it is possible to consider the small shift of the two points @xmath0 obtained above assuming that the coefficient @xmath141 is small .    </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath142 enters the equations with the multiplier @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can define @xmath142 in terms of unperturbed values and use the third of the eqs.([eq / pg4/1:swal ] ) as a definition of @xmath142 . </S>",

    "<S> now we can use our previous result as the unperturbed one in order to write the new functional @xmath145 depending on the parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149    in this case , for the @xmath0 singularity we have the conditions : @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , let us expand the functional @xmath154 around the solution for @xmath0 singularity of @xmath155 , that is around @xmath156 , up to the first order in @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> now instead of the relation ( [ eq / pg1/3:swal ] ) we have : @xmath158 within the proposed accuracy , it is irrelevant whether @xmath142 and @xmath143 are written in terms of @xmath159 or @xmath160 . </S>",

    "<S> the equations of zeroth order are fulfilled , and we obtain the system of 4 linear equations for the variables @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 : @xmath174    this system has the form @xmath175 the coefficients @xmath176 can be easily obtained by taking derivatives of the equations ( [ eq / pg2/2:swal ] ) and ( [ eq / pg3/1:swal ] ) -([eq / pg3/3:swal ] ) at the points @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> for example , @xmath178 this value is positive for the point @xmath179 and is negative for @xmath180 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the points @xmath0 move one towards another , and it is this result that we were going to show : this fact makes our qualitative results closer to numerical observations .    </S>",
    "<S> let us recall , that in fact the topology of the bifurcation surfaces has to be changed essentially if the higher degrees of @xmath121 are taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> the equations defining four variables @xmath181 at the point @xmath0 for @xmath182 are formally the same as the equations for @xmath0 in the first order in @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can continue our iteration process up to @xmath183 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath183 denote the terms of the second order in @xmath184 , which has the form @xmath185 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are written up to first order in @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> this new shift is also of the form ( [ eq / pg7/1:swal_1 ] ) but with @xmath160 changed for @xmath186 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for small @xmath169 the points @xmath0 continue to come nearer to one another .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted , that the obtained results do not contradict to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and one can show just in the same way as it is done in @xcite , that in our model with @xmath0-singularities the relaxation is logarithmic . </S>",
