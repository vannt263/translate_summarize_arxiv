    "the high redshift universe allows us to probe galaxy evolution directly , by presenting us with examples of galaxies at a fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "the resolution needed to study these objects is possible either with ground - based adaptive optics or with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "using such observations , disk galaxies have been detected up to redshift @xmath6 , when the universe was not even half of its present age .",
    "how do the properties of these galaxies compare with those of local disks ?",
    "@xcite showed that the scale - lengths of the @xmath7 disks were similar to those of local galaxies .",
    "likewise , bulges at @xmath8 are found to have had a small amount of luminosity evolution and no significant size evolution @xcite , although @xcite found a population of @xmath9 galaxies which have higher bulge surface brightness than the local galaxies .",
    "morphologies of high - redshift galaxies also have been studied and compared with those of local galaxies .",
    "the most prominent morphological feature of a large fraction of local galaxies is a bar @xcite .",
    "since these can drive very strong secular evolution @xcite , knowing how common they are at high @xmath10 is important for constraining disk evolution . using a sample of 46 galaxies observed in the hubble deep field ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the fraction of barred galaxies was @xmath11 at @xmath12 but decreased sharply from there to @xmath13 .",
    "this result subsequently turned out to be an artifact of the still limited resolution of the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , and several groups have now found a nearly constant barred fraction out to @xmath14 using the higher resolution made possible by acs @xcite .",
    "other disk structures which have been identified at high redshift include truncations at @xmath15 @xcite and warps @xcite .",
    "double - barred ( s2b ) galaxies , in which a small secondary bar is nested inside a larger primary bar , have instead been identified only out to @xmath16 thus far @xcite .",
    "indeed , the s2b catalog of @xcite contains only two galaxies ( out of 50 ) at a distance of more than @xmath17 and none further than @xmath18 .",
    "s2bs , which were first described by @xcite , have been postulated to be a mechanism for driving gas past the inner lindblad resonance of primary bars to feed the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) that power active galactic nuclei @xcite . despite the possibility of their playing such an important role in smbh nurture , understanding them",
    "has progressed significantly only in recent years .",
    "secondary bars have been sought in _ gas - poor _ early - type barred galaxies with high resolution _",
    "hst _ imaging in order to distinguish secondary bars from other nuclear structures such as disks , rings , spirals and dust extinction @xcite .",
    "we now know that secondary bars are unambiguously found in about @xmath19 of early - type barred galaxies .",
    "moreover , we finally have direct observational proof for a kinematic decoupling between the primary and secondary bars in one s2b galaxy , ngc 2950 @xcite .",
    "such decoupling is necessary , but not sufficient , for secondary bars to funnel gas inwards . on the theoretical side ,",
    "important progress has come from the development by @xcite of the orbit formalism necessary for understanding their dynamics .",
    "finally , simulators have started to produce gas - free s2b systems in their simulations @xcite .",
    "the secondary bars in these simulations rotated faster than the primary bars and survived for several gigayears , properties which favor smbh fueling .",
    "observing s2bs at significantly earlier epochs would allow us to compare them with local s2bs and would thus provide new insight into the formation and evolution of these objects .",
    "because of their small scales , their dynamical timescales may be quite short ( @xmath20 myr ) . however , this does not necessarily imply a short _ lifetime _ :",
    "since as many as @xmath21 of early - type barred galaxies harbor secondary bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it appears very unlikely that nuclear bars are destroyed and regenerated repeatedly in these nearly gas - free systems .",
    "instead , they probably have been in place a long time .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to investigate whether the relative properties of the secondary and primary bars show any evidence for evolution",
    ". a comparison of the stellar populations of inner and outer bar would be one way to address this issue .",
    "if the stellar populations of secondary bars are systematically younger than those of the corresponding primary bars , this would support the hypothesis that nuclear bars form out of gas driven in by the primary bar @xcite .",
    "if instead the secondary bars consisted of older stellar populations than the primary bars , this would make this scenario implausible .",
    "given that the difference between the optical properties of two stellar populations decreases rapidly with age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it would be desirable to observe s2b galaxies at larger look - back times .",
    "moreover , a large enough sample of s2bs at higher redshifts would reveal a possible evolution of the ratios of secondary - to - primary sizes .",
    "if inner bars lose angular momentum to the outer bar , they might grow larger in radius , leading to a larger ratio as time goes on .    while such questions motivate the search for and study of s2bs beyond the nearby universe , it is not yet clear whether such a study would be at all possible with present - day instrumentation . therefore , as a first step , it is necessary to perform a _ feasibility study _ , i.e.  to show that a ) s2bs can be found at significantly larger look - back times than known to date , and b ) the stellar populations of primary and secondary bars can be analyzed and distinguished .",
    "an estimate of the limiting redshift for detecting inner bars with the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) is provided by @xcite , who give a lower limit for a bar semi - major axis of @xmath22 times the point - spread function ( psf ) full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) . adopting @xmath23 psf fwhm @xmath24 and the concordance cosmology ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which we assume throughout ) , the resolution of the _ hst_/acs would be sufficient to identify inner bars out to @xmath27 provided that their sizes are similar to those of local nuclear bars from @xcite .",
    "this limit is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] by the dotted vertical lines , and is significantly larger than the redshifts of known s2b systems , @xmath28 .",
    "motivated by the foregoing estimate , we present a feasibility study for detecting and analyzing double - barred galaxies at intermediate redshifts , including our identification of the two most distant s2bs known so far . in section [ sec : data ] we describe briefly the publicly available data used in this study .",
    "section [ sec : morph ] explains how the objects were found , including a novel technique for identifying bars .",
    "a structural analysis of primary and secondary bars is presented in section [ sec : bars ] , followed by a colour and stellar population analysis in section [ sec : pop ] .",
    "several ( candidate-)s2bs in the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) are presented in section [ sec : cosmos ] , and a final discussion is presented in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the _ hst_/acs images of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) release v1.0 @xcite cover an area of 300 arcmin@xmath29 divided into two fields : the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) and the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) .",
    "they consist of four deep images through the f435w ( @xmath30 ) , f606w ( @xmath31 ) , f775w ( @xmath32 ) , and f850lp ( @xmath10 ) passbands of acs .",
    "the cdfs is divided into 18 sections and the hdfn into 17 sections with the images drizzled with a pixel scale of @xmath33 mas , chosen to optimize the sampling of the psf .",
    "the images are not perfectly background subtracted : there is a remaining background of the order of one third of the noise rms , which can vary by up to a factor of two across the image . since this can contaminate measurements of colour and morphological parameters , we subtracted an individual background flux value for each object and band .",
    "we defined this background as the median pixel value within a box of @xmath34 centered on the galaxy , after masking all sources .",
    "despite the common use of ellipse fits for bar identification , their limitations are well known ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and mainly originate from the fact that ellipse fits assume a definite ( namely elliptical ) isophotal shape of the object in question , which might not be the case in reality .",
    "motivated by the successful application of model - independent structural parameters such as asymmetry or concentration to galaxy morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we sought a bar identification method that would rely solely on such parameters and would therefore provide a computationally quick and easy way to detect bars .",
    "given the usual difficulties in reliably identifying nuclear structures in late - type galaxies because of the significant amount of patchy obscuration that could mimic bar - like central shapes , we restricted our study to early - type galaxies , i.e.  e / s0 galaxies as well as early - type spirals .",

    "* ) , where @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 is the radius enclosing @xmath38 of the total flux @xcite .",
    "the total flux was measured in the @xmath32-band within a circular aperture of @xmath39 the petrosian radius , @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the surface brightness .",
    "we set cutoffs at apparent magnitude @xmath43 and half - light radius @xmath44 pixels to ensure that the objects were bright and large enough for identification of an inner bar .",
    "these criteria yielded a working sample of 231 objects in the goods dataset .    to detect large bars with major axis exceeding @xmath45 of the size of the galaxy , we computed model - independent radial profiles of structural parameters in circular apertures ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 on the @xmath32-band images .",
    "we focus on large bars for two reasons : first , the bar needs to stand out in the radial structure profile , hence requiring its size to be a significant fraction of the galaxy radius , and second , small bars are less promising candidates for hosting nuclear bars that are large enough to be detected",
    ".    one structure parameter  the gini coefficient , @xmath48",
    "@xcite  proved to be a useful diagnostic for large bars .",
    "we calculate @xmath48 following the definition of @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of pixels in the image and @xmath51 is the flux and @xmath52 . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the absolute values of @xmath51 are required in order to preserve the correct structure at low flux levels , where noise can result in negative values of @xmath51 after background subtraction .",
    "@xmath48 quantifies the distribution of flux values among the pixels of an object s image .",
    "the two extreme values are @xmath53 if all pixels have the same flux , and @xmath54 if all the flux is concentrated in a single pixel .",
    "@xmath48 can therefore be thought of as measuring the contrast between the faintest and the brightest regions of a galaxy s image , _ no matter where in the galaxy they are located _ ; thus it does not assume any shape for the object . in our definition @xmath55",
    "is computed within each aperture as described above .",
    "circular apertures are preferred over elliptical ones because the shape of a bar clearly stands out in a circular aperture .",
    "an elliptical aperture instead would fit the bar s shape to a higher degree , preventing the bar from standing out quite as much .",
    "what do the gini profiles of ordinary galaxies look like ? from the objects in our working sample we assembled a subsample of such galaxies , ranging from ellipticals to late - type spirals and irregulars based on a visual classification . since we selected objects with high concentration values ,",
    "late - type spirals appear in our working sample generally when they are seen nearly edge - on .",
    "similarly , the objects classified irregular still require a large amount of their light to be centrally concentrated to enter the sample .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : mopro ] that @xmath55 steadily increases with radius for e / s0 galaxies ( possibly including edge - on early - type spirals ) , while for spirals it reaches a maximum and decreases thereafter .",
    "late - type spirals can be distinguished because their maxima in @xmath55 are lower and are reached earlier than in early - type spirals    in the gini profile of several galaxies , a plateau is seen at _ intermediate _ radii ( top left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mopro ] ) .",
    "we identify such a feature by its mathematical properties : the second derivative changes from negative to positive , with the first derivative positive before and after , but becoming small , or possibly negative , in between .",
    "we approximate the first and second derivative by considering small ( @xmath56 ) intervals , which are then smoothed by averaging over three data points at each step .",
    "an object was selected if its profile shows a plateau that is at least as strong as the one presented in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mopro ] .",
    "this also requires the bar to be strong , i.e. a significant fraction of the total light needs to make up the bar shape .",
    "bars that are so weak that they would hardly be seen without the help of unsharp masking or ellipse fits probably would not have enough effect on the gini coefficient to produce a clear plateau in the profile .",
    "a plateau is evident in 46 objects of our working sample .",
    "visual inspection shows that 17 of them indeed have a large bar , 23 galaxies are unbarred , while for 6 galaxies we could not decide whether a bar was present based on visual inspection .",
    "how can the shape of @xmath55 for a barred galaxy be understood ?",
    "first , the initial increase of @xmath55 with radius is caused by the brightest pixels being all located in the central region ; thus increasing the radius adds only fainter pixels .",
    "this leads to a continuously increasing spread in the pixel flux values , and thus each gini profile begins with increasing @xmath55 , independent of galaxy type .",
    "however , a bar is then able to maintain a relatively high surface brightness out to a larger radius than an unbarred object , therefore the fraction of faint pixels remains lower , which probably leads to the plateau in @xmath55 .",
    "thus the gini profile provides a simple way of identifying large , strong bars , and it can be computed easily and automatically for all sources detected in a deep survey such as goods .",
    "although we did successfully apply this bar detection method to the goods dataset , we point out that it is not yet optimized : the fraction of unbarred objects among the selected galaxies is @xmath57 , which would seem to not be a significant improvement over ellipse fits . moreover ,",
    "when visually inspecting all 231 galaxies of our working sample , 11 objects possess a bar but were missed by our method , partly because their bar is relatively small , but also because of spirals and lopsidedness .",
    "a quick visual study revealed that the method could be improved further , for example by including a second parameter to exclude those systems which are asymmetric .",
    "moreover , our above interpretation of the cause of the plateau in the profile might be too simplistic : it could well be possible that not ( only ) the bar itself is causing the plateau , but rather the configuration of a barred galaxy as a whole , i.e.  the distribution of pixel flux values _ around _ the bar .",
    "a full study of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed elsewhere ( pasquali et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "since completeness is not the goal for our feasibility study , we are satisfied with the easy derivation of the gini profiles and defer further quantitative evaluation of the method s potential .",
    "can the method be applied recursively to identify nuclear bars inside barred galaxies ?",
    "this did not prove feasible due to the small apparent size of nuclear bars and , more importantly , the significant amount of smoothly distributed underlying galaxy light which decreases the contrast of nuclear bars ( for the same reason , unsharp masks are such a useful tool for studying nuclear bars ) .",
    "thus we had to inspect the selected barred objects visually and through unsharp masks in order to identify nuclear bars ( sect.[sec : bars ] ) .",
    "two objects were clearly identified as double - barred : goods j033230.93 - 273923.7 , hereafter s2b1 , and goods j033233.46 - 274312.8 , hereafter s2b2 ; both lie in the cdfs part of the goods survey .",
    "here we present a structural analysis of s2b1 and s2b2 . for this purpose",
    "we use unsharp masks and ellipse fits as in @xcite .      the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] show , from top to bottom , an @xmath32-band image of s2b1 , an unsharp mask , and the ellipse fits .",
    "the unsharp mask was created by dividing the original image with one convolved with a gaussian of @xmath58 pixels ; in the center we insert another unsharp mask created through a convolution with a much smaller gaussian ( @xmath59 pixels ) to highlight the inner structure . apart from the huge primary bar ,",
    "a very prominent secondary bar is present along with a nuclear spiral .",
    "its spectroscopic redshift , as measured by the vimos vlt deep survey @xcite , is @xmath3 .",
    "s2b1 is therefore the most distant s2b galaxy known , at a luminosity distance of @xmath60wright / cosmocalc.html ] .",
    "the black scale bar in the image corresponds to a physical length of @xmath61 ; the image scale is @xmath62 kpc/@xmath63 .",
    "we visually classify s2b1 as sb0/a .    in order to quantify the structure of s2b1",
    ", we performed an ellipse fit using the iraf task ellipse . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : images ] ;",
    "both the primary and secondary bar can be clearly identified as significant local peaks in the ellipticity .",
    "we did not attempt a deprojection of s2b1 , since its outer structure is difficult to determine : the primary bar dominates the galaxy s appearance , and it can not be ascertained whether it is circular or still part of an oval distortion . since the primary bar lies along the major axis of the outer isophotes , as indicated by the nearly constant position angle in the ellipse fits , we do not expect measurements of its size and shape to be significantly affected by a , probably modest , inclination .    following @xcite , we measured the primary bar s semi - major axis at its maximum ellipticity @xmath64 , and the upper limit on the bar semi - major axis as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the smaller of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being the semi - major axis at the first ellipticity minimum outside the bar , and @xmath68 being the semi - major axis where the position angle has changed by @xmath70 from the bar position angle .",
    "the equivalent values for the secondary bar are @xmath71 and @xmath72 . the physical size of the primary bar in s2b1 is larger than 47 of the 50 s2bs presented by @xcite , while the secondary is larger than @xmath73 of erwin s sample",
    ".    visual inspection of the immediate environment of s2b1 reveals a jet - like object close to it and pointing towards its center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barryouter ] ) .",
    "this object is seen in all bands .",
    "if the secondary bar in s2b1 is feeding gas to an smbh , then a jet originating from the smbh may indeed be expected .",
    "however , its photometric redshift provided by the combo-17 survey @xcite is @xmath74 , suggesting the object is a background galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", one would not expect a photometric redshift ( which relies on template spectral energy distributions ) to yield useful results if the object actually was a jet .",
    "the x - ray flux of the galaxy would allow us to test for an active black hole in the center .",
    "the extended cdfs survey @xcite does not detect s2b1 , but it provides an upper limit on the x - ray flux .",
    "the 3 sigma upper limit on the count rate is @xmath75 ( virani , priv.comm . ) , which translates into an upper limit on the flux in the soft bands ( @xmath76 ) of @xmath77 , using the chandra x - ray center proposal planning toolkit pimms v3.7 with a power law spectral model and a photon index of 1.8 .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on the soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath78 . by applying equations 1 and 2 of @xcite",

    "the small unsharp mask reveals an inner bar and spiral in the center of s2b2 .",
    "this is confirmed by a local peak in ellipticity , although this peak is relatively weak due to the small apparent size of the bar .",
    "the position angle nicely tracks the inner bar and then changes by about @xmath84 outside of it , since the inner and outer bars in this galaxy are nearly perpendicular .",
    "s2b2 s spectroscopic redshift , as measured by 2dfgrs @xcite , is @xmath2 , putting it at a luminosity distance of @xmath85 .",
    "the black scale bar in the image corresponds to a physical length of @xmath61 ; the image scale is @xmath86 kpc/@xmath63 .",
    "we deprojected the galaxy by assuming that the ellipticity minimum outside of the primary bar is the apparent ellipticity of the galaxy as a whole ; we then obtained the deprojected size of the inner bar as @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding values for the primary bar are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which did not require deprojection since the primary bar is almost along the galaxy s apparent major axis .",

    "would test the hypothesis that gas in s2bs is fed to smbhs .",
    "comparisons of the available photometry from the acs images with population synthesis models allow us to estimate the age and metallicity distribution of the stellar component in the two galaxies .",
    "a pixel by pixel approach has the advantage of spatially resolving regions which may have undergone different histories of star formation .",
    "however , the uneven distribution of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) across the galaxy images results in complicated maps of uncertainties which are hard to interpret . in order to improve the spatially resolved analysis , we decided to perform an adaptive binning following the optimal voronoi tessellation method of @xcite , which has already been applied successfully to a study of early - type galaxies in goods / cdfs @xcite .",
    "a voronoi tessellation divides a region starting from a distribution of points called _",
    "generators_. the area ( or volume ) is then binned in those regions closest to a given generator .",
    "motivated by the analysis of integral field spectroscopy , @xcite presented an algorithm optimised for the binning of a 2d map into bins which yield a small scatter of the snr with respect to some target value and which are kept reasonably round in order to preserve , as much as possible , the spatial resolution .",
    "when we apply this method to colour maps , we ensure that the subsequent stellar population analysis is as homogeneous as possible .",

    "the inner bar shows the bluest colours in @xmath107 , which can be interpreted as indicating that its metallicity is lower than of the outer bar , and in addition either the stellar ages or the amount of dust is higher .",
    "however a unique interpretation is not possible with these data .",
    "the outer bar regions possess a larger colour spread than the inner bar , which presumably is caused mainly by dust ( given the patchy distribution of colours discussed above ) , but may partly be due to radial variations in the stellar populations .",
    "this galaxy has a conspicuous ring of young stars at a projected distance @xmath118  kpc ( @xmath119 ) from the center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] ) .",
    "interior to this ring , the red colours are indicative of either old populations or dust extinction .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ccd ] shows the colour - colour diagram of s2b2 .",
    "the inner region  shown as dots  corresponds to an @xmath32-band surface brightness between 17 and 18  mag / arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "the filled triangles are pixels in the outer bar  selected in a @xmath114 wedge centered at the position angle of the bar with surface brightness between 20 and 21  mag / arcsec@xmath29 .",
    "two radial bins are chosen in the same way as with s2b1 , and similar population synthesis model predictions are shown .",
    "note the remarkable difference between the outer bar and the red colours of the inner bar , which is significantly affected by dust .",
    "the figure hints at younger ages in the outer parts of the primary bar , which is clearly due to the ring of young stars mentioned above .",
    "in the course of our study , the reduced _",
    "hst_/acs @xmath32-band imaging data ( v1.2 ) of the first square degree of the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) became publicly available .",
    "since these data cover an area about twelve times larger than goods , they can be expected to host several s2b galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the cosmos image depth is only slightly lower than that of goods , therefore a search for s2bs with our gini profile method and subsequent visual inspection appeared promising .",
    "we applied the same selection criteria as for our goods dataset , i.e.@xmath35 , @xmath43 , and half - light radius @xmath44 pixels .",
    "indeed , we were able to identify two s2bs and five s2b candidates which we list in table  [ tab : cosmos ] .",
    "their images and unsharp masks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmos ] .    based on their unsharp masks and ellipse fits (",
    "not shown ) , the objects cosmos j095922.76 + 024245.3 and cosmos j095936.98 + 015107.6 clearly host inner bars .",
    "four of the other five galaxies probably contain nuclear disks since the inner position angles match those of their outer disks .",
    "the remaining object is an s2b candidate . in this analysis ,",
    "the larger pixel scale of the cosmos images as compared to goods has a noticeable effect ",
    "a drizzling process that would bring the cosmos pixel scale from the current @xmath120 mas down to @xmath33 mas as in goods would result in a better discrimination of inner bars .",
    "unfortunately , no further data ( such as colours and redshifts ) are publicly available for these galaxies ; therefore their distances , bar sizes , and stellar population properties remain unknown .",
    "to date , all observational studies of s2bs have been undertaken in the nearby universe . in this paper",
    "we presented the two most distant s2bs currently known , at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , corresponding to a look - back time of 1.3 and 1.9gyr , respectively .",
    "although our s2b sample contains only two objects , we can perform a consistency check with the number of s2bs that would be expected given the numbers for nearby objects .",
    "our goods sample of early - type barred galaxies consists of 17 objects that were selected by our gini profile method , plus 11 barred galaxies that were missed by the method ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : morph ] ) . adopting an s2b fraction of 30% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we would thus expect 8.4 s2bs to be within our sample . with a given distribution of redshifts , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] then leads to an estimate of the number of s2bs whose inner bar would be large enough to be identified .",
    "redshifts are available for 12 sbs in goods / cdfs from the combo-17 survey @xcite and the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with 6 objects beyond @xmath121 .",
    "when we adopt this distribution to be representative for all 28 sb galaxies , we would expect to detect @xmath122 s2bs , in excellent accordance with our findings . while this suggests no significant evolution of the s2b fraction , clearly a larger sample of s2bs at intermediate redshifts is necessary to address the statistics properly .",
    "any sample of intermediate - redshift s2bs would of course be biased towards large secondary bars , and also towards large primary bars  the latter being due to both the selection of barred galaxy candidates and due to a correlation of the sizes of inner and outer bar . despite this inevitable bias",
    ", it would be possible to compare the _ relations _ between the sizes of primary and secondary bar with those of the local sample : the data from @xcite show a clear correlation of primary and secondary bar size ( left panel of fig.[fig : sizes2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the secondary - to - primary ratio is not constant but it increases with increasing secondary bar size ( right panel of fig.[fig : sizes2 ] ) .",
    "if an intermediate - redshift sample showed an offset with respect to the local relations , this would hint at a decoupled evolution of sizes , possibly related to the loss of angular momentum .",
    "while s2b2 ( open square in fig .  [ fig : sizes2 ] ) falls onto the above relations , the primary bar of s2b1 ( open triangle ) is very large compared with its secondary .",
    "still , s2b1 falls within the scatter of the relations .",
    "in addition to the structural parameters , we presented a colour analysis of the two s2bs .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible from the available data alone to precisely trace back the star formation history of an individual galaxy ( and of its bars ) , especially given the possible effect of dust and the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "nevertheless , we show that population differences between the outer bar and the inner bar region can be quantified , demonstrating the feasibility of stellar population analyses of s2bs at intermediate redshifts .",
    "it is not clear whether the evolution of the primary bar and the secondary s stellar content are linked in some way .",
    "for example , the secondary bar could be formed from stars born from gas swept by the primary bar .",
    "an intermediate - redshift s2b sample of significant size would be able to address this question .",
    "if the amount of dust were small , the colours of s2b1 could be interpreted as the inner bar having lower metallicity and larger stellar ages ( sect .",
    "[ sec : barrycol ] ) , making the above scenario implausible for this galaxy .",
    "the colours of s2b 2 are clearly more strongly affected by dust and little can be said about the relative ages of the primary and secondary bars .",
    "another important result for future searches of s2bs stems from our detection of s2b2 : its inner bar has an apparent semi - major axis size of only @xmath123 psf fwhm but can still be recognized .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the estimate of @xmath22 psf fwhm as a lower limit from @xcite , probably also due to the increased resolution from image drizzling .",
    "we thus suggest 1.5 psf fwhm as a more modest minimum size for detecting nuclear bars .",
    "when we adopt this new limit , fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] demonstrates that we increase the maximum redshift for detection of the largest inner bars ( @xmath124 ) of local s2bs by more than a factor of two , from a redshift of @xmath27 to @xmath125 . in particular ,",
    "s2b1 with @xmath126 psf fwhm should still be detectable at @xmath127 given the new detection limit . to test this",
    ", we created a mock image of s2b1 at @xmath128 .",
    "taking into account the corresponding wavelength shift would require an image right between @xmath31-band and @xmath32-band to be redshifted. we therefore performed the artificial redshifting for both @xmath31- and @xmath32-band images .",
    "the images were rescaled and convolved with a moffat profile representing the psf of the goods images .",
    "gaussian noise corresponding to the noise of the original images was then added , and unsharp masks , ellipse fits and gini profiles were produced .",
    "the flux values were rescaled correctly throughout the process , taking into account surface brightness dimming as well as a proper normalization of the convolved images .",
    "we did not deconvolve the original image prior to redshifting it , which means that our final psf is slightly too large ; hence our treatment is conservative .",
    "the secondary bar can still be clearly identified in the unsharp masks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barryat03 ] ) , and the primary bar would also have been selected from its gini profile ( dotted line in top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mopro ] ) .",
    "the ellipse fits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barryat03 ] ) show the inner bar as a flat peak in ellipticity , with a sharp drop outside of it .",
    "this inner part looks very similar to the ellipse fit of s2b2 , for the obvious reason that both inner bars in the redshifted s2b1 and in s2b2 are close to their detection limit .",
    "since the inner bar of s2b1 is not exceptional compared to local s2bs ( 24% of the inner bars listed in @xcite are even larger ) , those could therefore be detected out to still larger redshifts , @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] ) .",
    "our identification of two s2bs and five more s2b - candidate objects in the cosmos data proves that in present - day deep surveys , it is worthwhile to search for distant s2bs .",
    "these galaxies can be analyzed in a similar way as presented in this paper as soon as redshifts and colour data become available .",
    "we have shown that _",
    "hst_/acs data are capable of making considerable progress in understanding the structure and evolution of such objects .",
    "we therefore see the possibility of an s2b sample distributed over a large redshift range in the near future .",
    "such a sample would serve as an important observational constraint on models of s2b formation .",
    "we described a first step in developing a model - independent method for detecting large and strong bars which we used here .",
    "while the method as presented here is not optimized , it appears that with further refinements it can become a useful method for identifying bars in large surveys .",
