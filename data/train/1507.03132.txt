    "in this paper we investigate expansive capabilities in periodic bar - and - joint frameworks .",
    "the expansive property refers to one - parameter deformations , sometimes simply called mechanisms , which , for any increase of the parameter , increase or maintain the distance between any pair of joints . by definition , a bar - and - joint framework will have expansive capabilities when possessing some non - trivial one - parameter expansive deformation .",
    "in dimension two , expansive motions have important applications in robot arm motion planning and linkage problems , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "mathematically , the key underlying structure is that of _ pointed pseudo - triangulation _ ,",
    "@xcite and properties of planar pseudo - triangulations have been widely explored , @xcite , @xcite . as a result of our periodic version of maxwell s lifting theorem , @xcite , @xcite",
    ", expansive planar periodic mechanisms can be similarly understood in terms of periodic pseudo - triangulations , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , in dimensions higher than two , a structural understanding of expansiveness remains , in many respects , an open problem . in the present study",
    ", we establish some necessary conditions and explore a number of periodic families of frameworks with expansive capabilities in dimension three and higher .",
    "after a brief review of basic notions regarding periodic bar - and - joint frameworks and their deformations @xcite , @xcite , we find in section  [ analog ] the proper analog for the planar pointedness condition and refer to it as _ pointedness in codimension two_. guided by this necessary condition , we define and investigate in section  [ type ] a type of periodic framework which can be constructed in arbitrary dimension and has expansive capabilities .",
    "we determine the _ cone of infinitesimally expansive deformations _ for this family . in section  [ stress ]",
    "we illustrate some new features of expansive behavior in dimension higher than two by investigating a stressed structure .",
    "section  [ end ] recalls the fact that expansive implies auxetic and presents our conclusions .",
    "we recall some fundamental definitions on periodic frameworks and their deformation theory , as introduced in @xcite and developed in @xcite , @xcite .    a @xmath1-periodic framework , denoted as @xmath2 ,",
    "is given by an infinite graph @xmath3 , a periodicity group @xmath4 acting on @xmath3 , a placement @xmath5 and a representation @xmath6 .",
    "the graph @xmath7 is simple ( has no multiple edges and no loops ) and connected , with an infinite set of vertices @xmath8 and ( unoriented ) edges @xmath9 .",
    "the _ periodicity group _",
    "@xmath10 is a free abelian group of rank @xmath1 , acting on @xmath3 without fixed vertices or fixed edges .",
    "we assume that the quotient multigraph @xmath11 ( which may have loops and multiple edges ) is _ finite _ , and use @xmath12 and @xmath13 to denote the number of vertex and edge orbits .",
    "the function @xmath14 gives a specific placement of the vertices as points in the euclidean space @xmath15 , in such a way that any two vertices joined by an edge in @xmath9 are mapped to distinct points .",
    "the _ injective group morphism _",
    "@xmath16 gives a faithful representation of @xmath4 by a _ lattice of translations _",
    "@xmath17 of rank @xmath1 in the group of translations @xmath18 .",
    "the placement is _ periodic _ in the obvious sense that the abstract action of the periodicity group @xmath4 is replicated by the action of the periodicity lattice @xmath19 on the placed vertices : @xmath20 .",
    "a one - parameter _ periodic deformation _ is a family of placements and a family of lattices parametrized by time @xmath21 , such that all bar lengths are maintained and the same abstract periodicity group @xmath4 acts on all the frameworks of the deformed family .",
    "a periodic framework is _ rigid _ if it has no periodic deformations other than the trivial ones resulting from euclidean isometries .",
    "the configuration space of the periodic framework is obtained from the placements of vertex orbits , subject to the algebraic constraints of prescribed ( squared ) lengths for edges .",
    "we factor out the action of the @xmath22-dimensional group of euclidean isometries .",
    "a framework is rigid when corresponding to an isolated point of the configuration space ; otherwise it is flexible .",
    "the deformation space of a framework is the connected component of the configuration space to which it belongs .    after choosing vertex representatives for all vertex orbits and @xmath1 generators for the periodicity lattice ,",
    "the jacobian matrix at a given placement @xmath5 is a @xmath23 matrix ( called the _ periodic rigidity matrix _ ) whose rank thus can not exceed @xmath24 . at a regular point the rank of the jacobian equals the dimension of the configuration space in a small neighborhood .",
    "we say that a periodic framework is _ infinitesimally rigid _ if its periodic rigidity matrix has the maximum rank of @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", the framework must have at least @xmath24 edges , properly placed . in @xcite , we have characterized the graphs which are periodically minimally rigid , when generically placed .",
    "we begin with a lemma showing that a non - trivial ( infinitesimal ) deformation can not be expansive unless all edges emanating from a vertex are _ pointed _",
    ", for all vertices which are not in some rigid component of the framework .",
    "[ pointed ] suppose the origin @xmath25 is connected by edges ( of fixed length ) to vertices @xmath26 , @xmath27 . if the vectors @xmath26 allow a linear combination    @xmath28    then no infinitesimal deformation with velocity vectors @xmath29 at @xmath29 and @xmath30 at @xmath26 can be effectively expansive .",
    "that is , the system of equalities and inequalities    @xmath31    @xmath32    with a least one strict inequality in ( [ expand ] ) , has no solution @xmath30 , @xmath27 .",

[ pointedbis ] suppose the origin @xmath25 is connected by edges ( of fixed length ) to vertices @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that this articulated system has an effective expansive infinitesimal deformation .",
    "then , the convex hull of the rays @xmath35 , that is , the cone    @xmath36    has the following structure . the maximal dimension of a linear subspace contained in @xmath37 is @xmath38 and there are hyperplanes containing this maximal linear part , with all remaining vectors strictly on one side .",
    "moreover , the infinitesimal deformation is trivial on the linear part of the cone .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "we apply lemma  [ pointed ] to the maximal subset of vectors which allow a zero linear combination with _",
    "strictly positive _ coefficients .",
    "we see that the infinitesimal deformation must be trivial on this subset of vectors . since they span",
    "the maximal linear part of the cone @xmath37 , what remains to be shown is that this linear part of the cone can not have dimension @xmath39 .    to prove this last point by contradiction",
    ", we may suppose ( by convenient labeling ) that @xmath40 give a @xmath41 dimensional simplex ( with 0 in the interior ) , in the linear part of the cone and are fixed .",
    "then , with any other vertex @xmath42 , the system    @xmath43    @xmath44    has only the trivial solution @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , we have a linear combination    @xmath46    @xmath47    and the inequalities of the system must all be equalities .",
    "it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that an effective expansive infinitesimal deformation is incompatible with a linear part of dimension @xmath39 in the cone @xmath37",
    ".    * remark .",
    "*   the argument shows that expansion can result only from expansion in the _ orthogonal complement _ of the linear part of the cone . this orthogonal complement has dimension at least two and intersects the full cone @xmath37 in a _ pointed cone _",
    "i.e. with linear part reduced to 0 .",
    "this motivates the following notion .",
    "[ pointedc2 ] a convex cone through 0 in @xmath15 is called pointed in codimension two when the linear part of the cone has dimension at most @xmath38 .",
    "a set of vectors with their common origin at 0 is called pointed in codimension two when contained in a convex cone pointed in codimension two .",
    "thus , expansiveness requires pointedness in codimension two , more precisely :    if a bar - and - joint framework allows an expansive infinitesimal deformation , then the edge vectors emanating from any vertex where the deformation is effective must be pointed in codimension two .",
    "we examine in this section a type of periodic framework which can be constructed in arbitrary dimension @xmath1 . the case @xmath48 is illustrated in figure  [ figsimplex3d ] . for simplicity",
    ", we may assume that we start with a _",
    "regular simplex _ in @xmath15 .",
    "the periodicity lattice will be generated by the edge vectors of this simplex .",
    "this gives one orbit of vertices , depicted in red .",
    "for the second orbit of vertices , depicted in green , we use a representative at the center of the simplex .",
    "the framework will have @xmath49 edge orbits , with all edges between green and red vertices .",
    "let us assume the initial simplex with one vertex placed at the origin and the remaining @xmath1 vertices at @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "then , @xmath50 generate the lattice of periods and the green center will be at @xmath52",
    ". we can describe a complete set of representatives for edge orbits by indicating all edges emanating from this green center : @xmath1 of them go to the red points of the facet @xmath53 and @xmath54 of them go to @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which should be seen as midpoints between pairs of red vertices at @xmath57 , @xmath51 .",
    "[ rigid ] by adding the @xmath1 edge orbits represented by edges between @xmath42 and @xmath57 , @xmath51 , the framework described above is turned into a minimally rigid framework .",
    "thus , the original framework has , locally , a smooth deformation space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "_  a geometric argument will be shorter than a rigidity matrix rank verification .",
    "when considering the isosceles triangle @xmath58 , the bars from @xmath42 to @xmath57 , @xmath55 and @xmath59 determine the other elements of the triangle .",
    "in particular , the period @xmath60 has determined length .",
    "it follows that all the edges of the simplex with vertices at @xmath42 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 are determined and likewise for the simplex with vertices at @xmath42 and @xmath57 , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the two simplices are rigid and must be aligned along the common altitude from @xmath42 . by periodicity",
    ", this determines the whole framework , up to isometry .",
    "the enhanced framework is therefore minimally rigid , while the original framework has @xmath1 degrees of freedom , with a smooth local deformation space .",
    "[ econe ] the minimally rigid framework in @xmath15 , with edge representatives connecting @xmath42 with the @xmath61 vertices at @xmath62 , @xmath51 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , becomes , locally , an expansive one - degree - of - freedom mechanism upon removal of one edge orbit of type @xmath63 , for any choice @xmath64 . as a consequence",
    ", the framework with all edge orbits of type @xmath63 , @xmath51 removed , has @xmath1 degrees of freedom and the infinitesimal expansive cone of the framework has @xmath1 extremal rays , corresponding to the expansive mechanisms resulting from single edge orbit removals .",
    "_ proof : _  by symmetry , it is enough to examine the case of removing the edge orbit of @xmath65 . the planar case is shown in figure  [ figexp2 ] .",
    "the case of arbitrary @xmath1 is completely similar .",
    "the facet @xmath66 expands when @xmath67 moves away from @xmath68 along the same altitude of the facet . in order to maintain the given bar connections",
    ", @xmath42 has to approach both facet @xmath66 and its parallel @xmath69 .",
    "an elementary computation shows that the descent towards the latter is _ more _ than the descent towards the former , resulting in increased distance between the hyperplanes supporting these two facets .",
    "it follows that the whole periodic motion is expansive for a sufficiently small interval of ` time ' . as discussed in (",
    "* borcea & streinu ( 2014b ) ) , infinitesimally , expansive deformations define a convex cone in the tangent space of the framework deformation space . for the family under consideration , it is clear that the mechanisms corresponding to single edge orbit removals provide the extremal rays of this cone .",
    "in this section we consider the three dimensional periodic framework shown in figure  [ figexpansivestressed ] . in dimension two ,",
    "if all rigid components are free of redundant bars , expansive frameworks do not have periodic stresses ( * ? ? ?",
    "* borcea & streinu ( 2015a ) ) . in higher dimensions",
    "this is not necessarily the case .",
    "our three dimensional example will have @xmath70 vertex orbits and @xmath71 edge orbits but more than @xmath72 degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall identify the periodic stress which gives the framework two degrees of freedom .",
    "then we find the two extremal rays of the infinitesimal expansive cone .",
    "we place one vertex orbit representative at the origin ( in red ) , with the lattice of periods generated by the standard basis : @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "we take a representative @xmath42 for the second orbit of vertices ( in green ) at @xmath75 .",
    "the edge orbits are represented by the edges connecting @xmath42 to the following eight ( red ) vertices : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    for infinitesimal considerations we may eliminate translations and assume that the origin remains fixed .",
    "then , the unknowns of an infinitesimal deformation are : @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath74 .",
    "the edge constraints give :    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    there is a linear dependence of these conditions with coefficients    @xmath87    thus , the framework has non - trivial periodic stresses and at least two degrees of freedom , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2015a ) ) .",
    "the fact that it has exactly two is shown on the right hand side of figure  [ figexpansivestressed ] .",
    "two local parameters which determine the periodic framework are the ( squared ) lengths of the periods @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "[ escone ] the three dimensional periodic framework shown in figure  [ figexpansivestressed ] is stressed and has a smooth two dimensional local deformation space .",
    "it has expansive capabilities and the two extremal rays of the infinitesimal expansive cone correspond to fixing the length of the period @xmath88 , respectively @xmath89 .",
    "we note that maintaining the length of @xmath88 , respectively @xmath89 is equivalent to inserting a new edge orbit represented by a connection between ( red ) vertices at 0 and @xmath88 , respectively 0 and @xmath89 .",
    "the expansive property of the resulting one - degree - of - freedom mechanisms is easily verified . at red vertices",
    "we ll have aligned bars , hence not strict pointedness , but only pointedness in codimension two , as defined above in section  [ analog ] .",
    "other examples of stressed frameworks with expansive behavior can be obtained by relaxing the periodicity lattice of known expansive mechanisms .",
    "periodic frameworks which allow expansive motions are subject to some distinctive structural conditions . while complete necessary and sufficient conditions are not known for dimensions higher than two , we have identified a necessary condition of _ pointedness in codimension two _ at all vertices where expansion is effective .",
