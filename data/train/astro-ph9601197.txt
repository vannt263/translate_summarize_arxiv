    "the discovery of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the cobe satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and its subsequent confirmation ( @xcite ) at large angular scales ( greater than @xmath11 ) has been followed by positive detections of anisotropies in the microwave sky at intermediate angular scales by a number of other experiments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and upper limits at smaller angular scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to reject foreground contamination ,",
    "most of these experiments observe the sky over a range of frequencies .",
    "additionally , several have successfully repeated their measurements of previous years .",
    "characterization of the anisotropy at medium angular scales ( @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) can strongly constrain theories of structure formation and cosmological parameters , mainly through the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite . for a recent review of the cmb see @xcite ) .",
    "we present results from an experiment designed to measure the angular power spectrum of the cbr at medium angular scales .",
    "the sk telescope observes from the ground in saskatoon , saskatchewan , canada .",
    "the observing scheme has many internal consistency tests which allow checks of the integrity of the measurement .",
    "a frequency span of 20ghz provides discrimination against foreground contaminants .",
    "measurements made by this experiment are consistent from year to year .",
    "in addition , we have reproduced the results of the msam1 - 92  ( @xcite ) experiment .",
    "partial descriptions of the sk instrument are given in @xcite ( sk93 ) , @xcite ( sk93 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( sk94 ) and @xcite ( sk93 to sk94 comparison ) .",
    "the instrument and calibration is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "previous results ( sk93 and sk94 ) are included in this analysis .",
    "the sk telescope is comprised of a corrugated feed horn illuminating a parabolic primary followed by a chopping flat with a vertical chopping axis .",
    "the telescope is steerable in azimuth , but fixed in elevation .",
    "observations are made in k@xmath14-band ( 26 ghz to 36 ghz ) and q - band ( 36 ghz to 46 ghz ) . observations made in each band are broken up into 3 frequency sub - bands and two linear polarizations .",

    "the beam widths are known to better than @xmath15 .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is comprised of a @xmath16 contribution due to uncertainty in the absolute calibration of cas - a , which is constant between years and radiometers , and a @xmath17 to @xmath18 contribution due to measurement uncertainty .",
    "the telescope pointing is determined from the position of cas - a . in 1995 ,",
    "the telescope was pointed @xmath19 differently than was intended , which was included in the analysis . in 1994 , the discrepancy was less than 1/10 of a beam , and was ignored .",
    "in addition , there was a @xmath20 jitter in the beam position from the chopping plate and base pointing accuracy . when convolved with the beam ,",
    "this can be approximated by adding this uncertainty in quadrature to the nominal beam width . for 1995",
    "this is results in a @xmath21 widening of the effective azimuth beam .",

    "these goals are achieved by sweeping the beam in azimuth on the sky by many beam widths with a large chopping flat , and then synthesizing effective antenna patterns in software . for simplicity in the discussion which follows ,",
    "telescope and observing parameters for the 1995 season are used .",
    "parameters for all years are listed in table  [ table : obparms ] .    as the beam is swept on the sky , the radiometer",
    "is sampled 168 times per complete sweep . in analysis the 168 samples from each sweep , @xmath37 ,",
    "are multiplied by a weighting vector , @xmath38 , to give @xmath39 . by choice of weighting vector the relative weighting of each spatial point in the sweep",
    "can be set allowing the synthesis of arbitrary effective antenna sensitivity patterns , @xmath40 , given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the position on the sky of the center of the main beam corresponding to weighting vector element @xmath38 and @xmath43 is the main beam pattern of the telescope pointed at @xmath44 .",
    "the azimuth dimension is denoted by @xmath22 and the elevation dimension by @xmath26 .",
    "the beam width of the telescope is given by @xmath45 .",
    "the effect of the rotation of the earth during an integration is included in @xmath46 , as denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if the weighting vector @xmath38 is selected so that data which are acquired when the chopping plate is centered are given a positive weight , and data which are acquired when the chopping plate is offset to the left or right are given negative weight , then a three lobed synthesized beam on the sky is produced ( hereafter referred to as the 3pt synthesized beam ) .",
    "the weighting vectors are normalized so that @xmath48 for a single sweep , not including the rotation of the earth .",
    "the mean of the weighting vector is zero in order to eliminate sensitivity to fluctuations in the mean temperature of the sky .",
    "since the weighting vectors for different effective antenna patterns are made to be nearly orthogonal all of the effective antenna patterns may be acquired from the same data .",
    "synthesized antenna patterns up to 19pt ( @xmath49hz ) are produced .",
    "the number of lobes is limited by the beam size to throw ratio , and not by the detectors .",
    "the synthesis of the 9pt beams is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : synth ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : antennas ] displays some of the synthesized beams . in total , including the three years , there are 37 .",
    "the 3pt through 9pt antenna patterns are similar for k@xmath1494 , q94 and q95 , allowing these data to be compared .",
    "since the sweep amplitude and pointing for sk93 was substantially different than for the other years , the k@xmath1493 3pt beam is also substantially different .",
    "comparing sk93 with sk94 requires the use of a specially optimized weighting vector ( k@xmath1493 overlap ) .",
    "data are acquired in two modes : in the first mode ( _ cap _ data ) , which was used all three years , the chopping plate axis is vertical which places the beam at a constant elevation of @xmath50 , the elevation of the north celestial pole ( ncp ) in saskatoon .",
    "the beam is swept sinusoidally @xmath51 in azimuth ( @xmath52 peak to peak on the sky ) at 2.976 hz .",
    "the center of the sweep is alternated every 40.3 seconds between @xmath53 east of the ncp and @xmath54 west of the ncp . as the earth rotates throughout the day",
    ", the celestial polar cap is covered , from the ncp to @xmath55 declination .",
    "data acquired in the east are repeated @xmath56 hours later in the west , giving a very powerful systematic test .",
    "these data are multiplied by weighting vectors which produce a family of synthesized beams on the sky from 3pt to 19pt , and are then integrated into 24 ( for 3pt to 5pt ) or 48 ( for 6pt to 19pt ) bins in right ascension ( ra ) .    in the second mode ( _ ring _ data ) , which was only used in 1995 , the chopping plate is tilted back @xmath57 which raises the beam elevation @xmath58 to 60.2 .",
    "the telescope is pointed so that the center of the sweep is north .",
    "the beam is swept sinusoidally with a peak to peak amplitude of 3.36on the sky . in the small angle approximation ,",
    "the beam is swept in ra at a constant declination . as the earth rotates an entire ring at @xmath55 declination",
    "is sampled .",
    "synthesized beams are generated in the same way as with the _ cap _ data , except that a new weighting vector must be generated every sweep to keep the synthesized beam fixed in ra during its integration .",
    "the synthesized beams are smaller than the amplitude of the sweep which allows positions on the sky to be tracked in software .",
    "three point to 6pt synthesized beams are produced , as well as the effective 3pt beam pattern of the msam1 - 92  experiment .",
    "the _ ring _ data lacks the east to west comparison test of the _ cap _ data .",
    "however , synthesis of the msam beam makes it possible to compare directly with a very different experiment .",
    ".amount of data at different cut levels .",
    "the first cut level for each experiment listed is the nominal cut used .",
    "the others are used for consistency checks .",
    "@xmath59 is used to convert @xmath60 to receiver net ( see text ) .",
    "[ table : xi ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , the data are combined into 5 angular scale bins and presented in table  [ table : dtlg ] and figure  [ fig : dtlg ] . to produce each of these bins ,",
    "all of the data which is sensitive to a given range of angular scales is combined using the full correlation matrix ( see section  [ sec : like ] ) .",
    "for instance , the first bin is comprised of the 3pt to 6pt _ cap _ data from all three years .",
    "the effective window functions for each bin using equation ( [ eq : sumwin ] ) are presented in figure  [ fig : wing ] .",
    "also presented in table  [ table : dtlg ] are values for the angular spectral index @xmath61 ( see section  [ sec : dtl ] ) .",
    "the negative spectral index around @xmath62 which was reported in netterfield ( 1994 ) with the 1994 data alone is again seen in the lowest angular bin .",
    "the lowest four points in figure  [ fig : dtlpt ] also shows this locally falling spectrum . however , this trend is dominated by the 3pt data being high .",
    "additionally , for each of the 5 angular bins , including the first one , the slope is consistent with 0 .",
    "the angular spectrum of the whole sky may have a dip at these scales , or this effect could be a result of sample variance .",
    "this issue will be resolved by extended sky coverage to reduce sample variance .    while all known correlations have been taken into account in generating the likelihoods for each of the combined groups ,",
    "there are still some correlations between groups .",
    "they are small ( @xmath63 ) , however , and may be ignored for most analysis .    not included in the quoted error bars are the effects of calibration and beam uncertainties .",
    "as discussed , the calibration uncertainty is @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , mainly due to uncertainty in the temperature scale of cas - a .",
    "this has very little effect on the uncertainty of the spectral index , @xmath66 , and no effect on the shape of the angular spectrum .",
    "rather this has only an effect on the over - all temperature scale .",
    "this large normalization uncertainty must be included in any comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "beam uncertainties , as well as contributing to calibration errors , also produce uncertainties in the angular spectrum . for uncertainties in the beamwidth along the elevation axis ,",
    "the only effect is in the calibration ( miss - estimating the beam solid angle in predicting the signal from cas - a ) , and has been included in that error bar . for uncertainties in the azimuth beam width the effect is a function of the weighting vectors used . for the 4pt synthesis , where the physical beam width is small compared to the width of the synthesized lobes , only the temperature scale",
    "is effected , as with the elevation beam . for the 13pt synthesis , however , the additional effect of mis - stating the beam overlap between points very nearly cancels the effect on the calibration .",
    "the result of this is that the @xmath15 azimuth beam uncertainty yields an additional @xmath15 relative uncertainty between the 4pt and 13pt synthesized beam data .",
    "this effect is small for this experiment given the error bars on the spectrum and is ignored . +",

    "there are , however , potential sources of foreground contamination . two major classes are diffuse galactic emission , and unresolved point sources .",
    "limits may be placed on the level of both of these potential contaminants .",
    "potential sources of diffuse galactic contamination include dust , synchrotron , and free - free emission .",
    "the level of dust contamination at 40ghz and @xmath67 has be estimated to be less than 2 ( @xcite ) , which is far smaller than the signals measured here .",
    "similarly , recent measurements of the amplitude of diffuse free - free emission based on h@xmath68 emission have been made for the saskatoon observing region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements place an upper limit of 6at 30ghz for the sk93 3pt beam .",
    "once again this is too small to account for the observed signals .",
    "an analysis of high latitude galactic emission in the cobe 2 year data places similar limits on both foregrounds at large angular scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "an estimate of the amplitude of synchrotron emission can be made by extrapolating radio maps at 408mhz ( @xcite ) and 1.4ghz ( @xcite ) to 30ghz assuming a temperature spectral index of @xmath69 .",
    "this predicts a signal of less than 5 in k@xmath1493 , which is much smaller than the measured signals .",
    "however , if the spectral index of the synchrotron emission varies spatially by @xmath70 , then @xmath71 signals could be expected .",
    "the spectral index of these fluctuations would still be characterized by @xmath72 .",
    "the most powerful discriminant against foreground contamination is based on the frequency spectrum of the fluctuations ( @xmath66 ) . in section  [",
    "sec : beta ] , for @xmath73 , @xmath66 was found to be @xmath74 which is inconsistent with the spectral index of dust ( @xmath75 ) , free - free emission ( @xmath76 ) , or synchrotron emission ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "additionally , since the angular spectrum for galactic emission falls as @xmath77 ( @xcite ) , it is very unlikely that the galaxy is a significant contaminant at any angular scale .    of more concern for several reasons",
    "is potential contamination by unresolved point sources .",
    "firstly , the angular spectrum of a family of point sources is expected to rise as @xmath78 , so the @xmath66 limits placed at large angular scales are weaker at smaller angular scales .",
    "additionally , since the mechanism for radiation varies between individual sources , the expected @xmath66 also varies , and in many cases is not accurately described by a simple power law .",
    "this is of particular concern since no flux - limited survey of the sk observing region in has been performed over our frequencies ( 26ghz to 40ghz ) .",
    "however , it is still possible to make some estimates of the level of contamination via comparison with msam1 - 92 , source counts from the ovro ring experiment ( @xcite ) at smaller scales and an extrapolation of existing point source surveys .",
    "while @xmath66 varies from source to source , it is expected that over a sufficiently wide frequency range no foreground source will have a spectrum consistent with @xmath79 .",
    "consequently our comparison of sk95 with msam1 - 92  which yields a limit on @xmath66 of @xmath80 with a frequency baseline from 40ghz to 240ghz assures that the sky covered by both experiments is devoid of significant point contamination .",
    "however , this field only represents 8 square degrees of the total of 200 square degrees observed by sk95 .",
    "a second approach is to use results from other experiments and point source surveys .",
    "the ovro ring experiment has observed 96 fields at 20ghz .",
    "they find @xmath81 at @xmath82 . here",
    "we make the assumption that the signal is dominated by poisson distributed unresolved point sources . extrapolating in angular scale by @xmath83 to @xmath2 , the angular scale of the 19pt data set , one arrives at an expected contribution of 21 .",
    "since ovro ring was performed at 20ghz , this number needs to also be scaled in frequency . a conservative estimate of the `",
    "typical ' @xmath66 for a point source is that its flux is constant in frequency , ( i.e.,flat spectrum or @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , an estimate of the point source contribution at the smallest scales of the sk experiment based on ovro ring source counts is 10at 40ghz .    as a final estimate of the level of point source contamination ,",
    "the expected amplitude of known point sources in the observing region is extrapolated .",
    "table  [ table : sources ] lists the brightest of these .",
    "in addition to the sources listed in table  [ table : sources ] , all of the sources in the s5 catalog ( @xcite ) are used .",
    "based on an analysis of iras faint sources , it is considered unlikely that a new population of sources exists within our observing frequencies ( @xcite ) . the spectral index from the literature",
    "is used to extrapolate to 40ghz whenever possible .",
    "if a measured frequency spectral index is not known , the source is assumed to be of constant flux with frequency .",
    "a source map of the observing area is made , and the sk observing strategy simulated on it .",
    "the largest estimated contribution is to the 19pt data , and is @xmath85 , which could be significant .",
    "however , from table  [ table : dtlsep ] , the 19pt data yields a 163upper limit with a maximum likelihood at 0 .",
    "the estimated contribution to the 17pt data is 23 , which would imply a 4% contribution to our 69detection at these scales .",
    "the predicted signal is dominated by sources in ra bins 5 and 10 .",
    "the measured 17pt data show no excess in these bins , and re - analyzing the data with these bins deleted changes the most likely value for the 17pt data by less than 1% . for the 13pt data , at @xmath86 ,",
    "the expected contribution is @xmath87 . from table  [",
    "table : dtlsep ] , the measured value is @xmath88 . subtracting the source contribution in quadrature yields less than a 1% effect .",
    "the data , along with estimated contributions from foreground contaminants are presented in figure  [ fig : sources ] .",
    "the indications are that the sk data are not seriously contaminated by foreground sources . however , extending the coverage to smaller angular scales will require improved discrimination from point sources .",
    "the rich set of internal and external consistency checks inherent to this experiment indicate that a signal fixed to the celestial sphere has been detected .",
    "the limits placed on the frequency spectral index @xmath66 rule out significant contamination from diffuse galactic emission .",
    "the limits on @xmath66 over a very large frequency range placed by the successful comparison with the msam1 - 92  experiment further reduce the likelihood of significant contribution to the signal by foreground contaminants .",
    "conservative extrapolations from existing point source catalogs strengthen this argument .",
    "the evidence is compelling that the signal which has been detected is due to anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "this experiment has measured the angular spectrum of these anisotropies simultaneously with one experiment and with equal calibration error at all angular scales .",
    "we find that the spectrum rises from @xmath89at @xmath90 to @xmath91 at @xmath8 .",
    "this can be used to place significant limits on the reionization history of the universe , and , within a given theoretical framework , begin to place limits on cosmological parameters .",
    "a quantitative comparison with theory will presented elsewhere .    given the relative complexity of this analysis , it is important to mention that much of the analysis has been repeated with completely different programs by two of the authors to verify accuracy .",
    "the consistency of the naive @xmath92 based tests with the full likelihood analysis further strengthens our confidence in our programs and techniques .",
    "in addition , andrew jaffe and j.r .",
    "bond at cita have repeated and extended our analysis of the sk93 and sk94 data , again confirming our analysis .    to improve the discriminating power of this experiment several things",
    "are needed besides reducing the size of the error bars .",
    "first of all , it must be confirmed at high @xmath4 .",
    "additionally , a wider frequency coverage at smaller scales will improve discrimination against point sources .",
    "a better calibration will improve comparison with cobe , effectively increasing the range of angular scales over which a theory can be tested .",
    "it is possible to make a map of the cmb anisotropy from these data .",
    "a map of an extended region of the sky with better signal to noise will be useful to distinguish between gaussian and non - gaussian models .",

    "<S> we report on a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is measured in 23 different multipole bands from @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and in 6 frequency bands from 26ghz to 46ghz over three observing seasons . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are consistent from year to year . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency spectral index of the fluctuations ( measured at low @xmath4 ) is consistent with that of the cmb and inconsistent with either dust or galactic free - free emission . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observations of the msam1 - 92   experiment ( @xcite ) are repeated and confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> the angular spectrum shows a distinct rise from @xmath5at @xmath6 to @xmath7 at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these values do not include an overall @xmath9 @xmath10 calibration uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis and possible systematic errors are discussed . </S>"
