    "transmission of linear waves through inhomogeneous media is a topic of wide interest @xcite . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "two basic resonant features of wave scattering are known .",
    "one of them corresponds to the wave travelling above a barrier or a potential well .",
    "proximity of the wave s frequency to that of a standing wave captured inside the scattering potential leads to a resonance , i.e. , the transmission may be strongly enhanced in a vicinity of the resonance @xcite .",
    "in fact , the transmission at resonance is perfect , which is used in fabry - perrot interferometers @xcite .",
    "the connection of the resonant scattering to the levinson s theorem and the existence of bound states in potential wells is discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "resonant reflection is possible too , as a consequence of the fano resonance @xcite , and it occurs whenever a wave may choose between two scattering paths , which finally merge into one exit .",
    "destructive interference may then lead to total reflection .",
    "an adequate explanation goes through the coupling of a local fano state to a continuum @xcite .",
    "the wave may then again either pass directly through the continuum or by visiting the fano state .",
    "the resonance condition is provided directly by the matching of the wave s frequency to the eigenfrequency of the fano state .",
    "more than one wave paths are typically also generated by time - dependent scattering potentials .",
    "fano resonances imply the coherence of the wave phases throughout the scattering process , hence any significant dephasing effects will suppress the resonance . at the same time",
    ", the resonant transmission mechanism does not rely on phase coherence , therefore dephasing does not destroy it .",
    "similar situations can also be observed in nonlinear systems which possess continuous or discrete translational invariance .",
    "for instance , nonlinear lattice models support time - periodic spatially localized states in the form of discrete breathers @xcite .",
    "if small - amplitude plane waves are sent towards such a breather , it acts as a time - periodic scattering potential .",
    "the temporal periodicity of the potential leads to excitation of many new scattering channels , shifted by multiples of the breather s fundamental frequency relative to the frequency of the incoming wave @xcite .",
    "even if all the additional channels are closed ones , i.e. , they do not match the plane - wave s frequency , they may generate localized fano states which resonate with the open channel and thus lead to fano - resonant backscattering @xcite .",
    "in addition , resonant transmission can also be observed in this case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the transmission properties of small - amplitude solitons ( rather than plane linear waves ) in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation with two types of scattering centers .",
    "the first one is a fano - defect center , which is an extra level coupled to the dnls equation at one site of the underlying lattice .",
    "this fano center may actually be a strongly localized discrete breather of the dnls model @xcite .",
    "the second type is a two - site impurity which gives rise to two bound states .",
    "our goal is to predict resonant backscattering and resonant transmission of the small - amplitude soliton impinging onto these defects . to this end",
    ", we consider the soliton as a superposition of plane waves or modes , while the nonlinearity leads to mode - mode interactions , which may or may not cause dephasing effects in the course of the scattering process .",
    "we will find values of the velocity of the incident soliton at which the resonant transmission and reflection are possible .",
    "the predicted effects can be observed in any physical system which is modelled by the dnls equation , the most straightforward ones being arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides .",
    "these may be realized as set of parallel cores fabricated on a common substrate @xcite , or a virtual array induced in a photorefractive material illuminated by a set of parallel laser beams @xcite .",
    "before considering the scattering of solitons , we will set the stage , using two simple models which make it possible to observe resonant transmission and reflection in linear wave scattering . in both cases , we will use the linear discrete schrdinger equation as the unperturbed system .",
    "later on , we will add nonlinearities to make propagation of solitons possible .",

    "quite a different situation takes place if the local scattering term , added to the linear schrdinger equation , is nonlinear  in that case , the solution to the scattering problem is not unique , and may be subject to local modulational instability @xcite .",
    "in order to consider a possibility of resonant transmission or reflection in the scattering of a soliton on a local defect , we first add nonlinear terms to the linear schrdinger equation [ see the first equation in the system ( [ eq2 ] ) ] , thus arriving at the dnls equation , @xmath62 small - amplitude ( hence , broad ) moving solitons in eq .",

    "there are two characteristic time scales , which describe the scattering of the soliton ( [ eq16 ] ) by the resonant defect .",
    "one of them is the time of the soliton - defect interaction , which is estimated as the soliton s width @xmath70 in the coordinate space , divided by its velocity : @xmath71 the interaction between waves composing the free soliton defines the second time scale . it can be estimated as the time of dispersion of the wave packet ( [ eq16 ] ) in the linearized equation ( [ dnls ] ) , with @xmath72 , which yields , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , a result @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a group velocity of the waves , and @xmath75 is the relative velocity between faster and slower waves composing the soliton .",
    "the interaction between the plane - waves constituents does not play a significant role during the scattering of the soliton if @xmath76 hence , under this condition , the soliton may be considered as a set of noninteracting plane waves while it suffers scattering on the defect .",
    "the transmission of each wave component is then determined by the corresponding coefficient for the linear model , see the previous section . if , in this regime , @xmath77 is sufficiently small in comparison with the width of the transmission or reflection resonance for the plane waves , then all the waves composing the soliton will be resonantly transmitted or reflected , provided that velocity @xmath64 matches the resonance condition .    when @xmath78 , the wave - wave interactions become important during the scattering process .",
    "since these interactions may lead to dephasing of individual waves , we expect that the resonant transmission will not be affected , while the resonant fano reflection will be suppressed , as it relies on keeping the wave phase coherence in the course of the scattering process .",
    "a nonlinear model which may give rise to the resonant reflection of the soliton is based on a straightforward generalization of eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath79 we performed numerical simulations of eqs .",

    "the total number of sites was large , @xmath80 .",
    "time was measured in dimensionless units .",
    "the soliton is launched from the left with a positive velocity @xmath64 .",
    "after the interaction with the fano defect , the soliton is typically found to be split into two soliton - like fragments which move in opposite directions , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be found from numerical data , using the conservation of the norm @xmath81 in the dnls equation ( another conserved quantity is the hamiltonian ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient is then defined as the ratio of the norms of the transmitted wave packet and initial soliton : @xmath82 where we choose @xmath83 .    in the case shown in fig .",

    "the minimum does not reach zero , which is explained by the finite spectral width @xmath77 of the soliton , i.e. , wave components which build up the soliton do not fully backscatter .",
    "it should be stressed that the close proximity of the numerically found minimum to the anticipated point predicates upon the conditions ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ timescales ] ) , but it is not related to the fact that the particular example displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] has @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , numerical results are very similar at other values of @xmath90 .    to study the case when the wave - wave interactions are important during the time of the interaction between the soliton and the defect , i.e. , @xmath91 , the dispersion time was changed by shifting the soliton s central wavenumber @xmath68 to the spectrum s edge , keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "the fano resonance is observed in the simulations until @xmath92 . with the further decrease of @xmath93 ,",
    "the fano minimum in the @xmath94 curve becomes less pronounced , and disappears at some critical value of @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , we have found numerically that for @xmath95 , when the condition of  the smallness of @xmath96 is fulfilled , the fano resonance disappears at @xmath97 .    .",

    "the minimum at @xmath88 is quite shallow in this case.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    still we observe a smooth @xmath94 curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this result implies that the plane - wave modes which make up the soliton loose their resonant backscattering features .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the interaction of many modes between themselves can be interpreted as a multichannel scattering problem ( as opposed to many uncoupled single - channel scattering processes in the absence of the mode - mode interaction ) .",
    "multichannel scattering problems are expected to have less pronounced fano resonance features , since the fano resonance is inherently based on keeping phase coherence in order to support the destructive interference . as the phase coherence gets suppressed by the mode - mode interactions , the necessary interference is detuned .",
    "the passage of a soliton through a single - site impurity has been already studied in many works @xcite .",

    "( [ tr2 ] ) , see fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "remarkably , neither the position of the resonance nor the value of the transmission coefficient at the resonance is conspicuously affected when the wave - wave interactions become important .",
    "this clearly indicates that dephasing does not seriously harm the resonant - transmission mechanism .",
    "we have shown that solitons may be resonantly transmitted or backscattered depending on their velocity and the type of the scatterer .",
    "we explained these effects by considering the soliton as a superposition of plane - wave modes in the limit when the mode - mode interaction is not affecting the scattering process . by tuning parameters into a regime where the mode - mode interaction becomes essential during the scattering process",
    ", we have observed that the phase - insensitive resonant transmission is not affected .",
    "however , the fano - resonant backscattering , which relies on the phase coherence in the two - channel scattering process , is completely suppressed in this case , which is a consequence of the dephasing of individual modes due to the interaction between them .",
