    "entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics . in the last few years",
    "a lot of research has been done in the field of detection and quantification of entanglement .",
    "the original method for detection of entanglement was bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "bell s inequality is derived from assumptions of a general , local hidden - variable theory ( lhvt ) .",
    "this inequality is unique in the sense that all local hidden variable models satisfy it . in other words ,",
    "the inequality derived by bell has clearly demonstrated that some quantum mechanical predictions , in the ideal scenario , can not be reproduced by any lhvt . not only that , the violation of bell s inequality is a strong signature for the inseparability of a quantum state .",
    "however , bell s inequality is unable to detect all possible entangled states as there are examples of entangled states which does not violate it @xcite .",
    "thus one can conclude that violation of bell s inequality implies entanglement , but the presence of entanglement does not necessarily imply violation of the inequality .    there is thus a need for a measure that can quantify the amount of entanglement present in the system . out of many measures",
    "a very convenient one is concurrence @xcite .",
    "apparently , it may look that there is no difference in quantifying inseparability and quantumness .",
    "however , in general , it is not so .",
    "even though it is quite well established that entanglement is essential for certain kinds of quantum - information tasks like teleportation and super - dense coding , the precise role of entanglement in quantum information processing still remains an open question .",
    "it is not clear , whether all information - processing tasks that can be done more efficiently with a quantum system than with a comparable classical system require entanglement as a resource .",
    "indeed , there are instances where it is possible to do more with quantum rather than the classical , in the absence or near absence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "this tells us that one can not ascribe the mere absence of entanglement as a signature of classicality . as an example",
    ", we can talk about the dqc1 ( deterministic quantum computation with one bit ) model where the system has very little entanglement , and even that little vanishes asymptotically , yet it provides an exponential speedup @xcite .",
    "this raises an important question that if not entanglement what explains all the quantum advantages ?",
    "most likely , it has something to do with the structure and inherent non - locality of quantum mechanics .",
    "interestingly , it is known that non - locality and entanglement are not equivalent features .",
    "entanglement is the feature that having complete information about the subsystems does not reproduce the complete information of the whole system .",
    "not surprisingly , this is not the only characterization of a quantum system .",
    "for instance , the collapse of one part of a subsystem after measurement of another is another feature which is unique to quantum systems and does not have any classical analogue .",
    "the quantity that tries to capture this unique feature is the quantum discord @xcite .",
    "quantum discord tries to quantify all types of quantum correlations including entanglement .",
    "it must be emphasized here that discord supplements the measures of entanglement that can be defined on the system of interest .",
    "it aims to capture all the non classical correlations present in a system , including entanglement .",
    "other measures of quantum correlation , similar to discord , are the quantum dissonance @xcite , that aims to capture quantum correlations in separable states and measurement induced disturbance @xcite .",
    "it may appear that analyzing bell s inequality , concurrence , quantum discord for a two - qubit bipartite system is an exhaustive way of analyzing the inseparability along with quantumness of the system , but there is an applicational aspect to it .",
    "one of such application is teleportation .    in the early nineties",
    "a new aspect of quantum entanglement was discovered , viz .",
    "teleportation @xcite .",
    "teleportation is purely based on classical information and non - classical einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlations @xcite .",
    "the basic scheme of teleportation is to transfer an arbitrary quantum state from sender to receiver using a pair of particles in a singlet state shared by them .",
    "when two parties share a mixed state instead of a singlet , it is not possible to teleport an unknown quantum state with full fidelity .",
    "the natural question was to find out the optimal value of teleportation fidelity of an unknown quantum state ; a fidelity above which will ensure non - classical character of the state forming the quantum channel .",
    "it was shown that for a purely classical channel the optimum teleportation fidelity is @xmath4 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following question regarding quantum teleportation , bell - chsh ( clauser - horne - shimony - holt ) inequalities and inseparability was raised : what is the exact relation between bell inequalities violation and teleportation ?",
    "bell inequalities are basically built upon the locality and reality assumption and have nothing to do with quantum mechanics .",
    "it is quite obvious that the state which violates bell s inequality can be useful for teleportation .",
    "however , in another work , werner @xcite gave an example of an entangled state , which has the unique feature of not violating bell s inequality for a certain range of classical probability of mixing . an interesting question to ask was whether states which do not violate bell - chsh inequalities are suitable for teleportation .",
    "an answer to this question was offered in the form of examples of mixed two spin-@xmath5 entangled states that do not violate bell - chsh inequalities but can still be useful for teleportation @xcite .",
    "however any state that violates bell - chsh inequalities is always suitable for teleportation . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "these relations for two qubit mixed entangled state arising from the buzek hillery quantum cloning machine were probed .",
    "an issue of central importance is the study of quantum correlations in mixed states .",
    "open quantum systems @xcite provide a natural setting for a systematic discussion of mixed states .",
    "a basic motivation of this work is to find out whether there are mixed , entangled states ( having positive concurrence ) which do not violate bell s inequality but can still be useful for teleportation .",
    "we consider entangled states generated by open system models involving quantum non demolition ( purely dephasing ) as well as dissipative type of system - reservoir interaction .",
    "in addition , we make a comparative study of various measures of quantum correlations like concurrence , bell s inequality , quantum discord and teleportation fidelity on mixed states , generated by the above evolutions .",
    "interest in the relevance of open system ideas to quantum information has increased in recent times because of the impressive progress made on the experimental front in the manipulation of quantum states of matter towards quantum information processing and quantum communication .",
    "_ @xcite and turchette _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have performed a series of experiments in which they simulated both pure dephasing as well as dissipative evolutions , by coupling the atom ( their system-@xmath6 ) to engineered reservoirs , in which the coupling to , and the state of , the environment are controllable .",
    "there has been considerable interest , in recent times , in the study of quantum correlations in open quantum systems .",
    "quantum and classical correlations have been studied , in the context of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "an operational measure of quantum correlations , based on the dynamics of these correlations in open system evolutions , was proposed in @xcite , while in @xcite , a study of classical and quantum correlations was made , on a two - qubit system interacting with two independent environments .",
    "a study of quantum discord and entanglement was made , on a system consisting of two coupled quantum dots in @xcite , and it was shown that discord can be more resistant to dissipation that entanglement . in @xcite , markovian dynamics , and in @xcite , non - markovian dynamics of quantum discord was made on a two qubit system , and it was seen that , in some conditions , quantum discord and entanglement can behave very differently .",
    "interesting experimental investigations have also been made in this context . in @xcite ,",
    "a theoretical and experimental study was made on the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations in an nmr quadrupolar system , while in @xcite , the dynamics of different kinds of bipartite correlations was investigated , experimentally , in an all - optical setup . in @xcite ,",
    "an interesting experiment was presented , in which dissipation induces entanglement between two atomic objects , thereby paving the way for long - lived entanglement , in a steady state . in a recent work , it was shown that almost all quantum states have a non zero quantum discord @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , a numerical comparison between discord and entanglement of formation was made .",
    "some authors investigate the dynamical relations among entanglement , mixedness and non locality , quantified by concurrence c , purity p and maximum of bell function b , respectively , in a system of two qubits in a common structured reservoir @xcite . in another work , the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in presence of non dissipative decoherence",
    "is studied @xcite .    in another important work @xcite the authors a general characterization of quantum discord and entanglement in large families of states ( bell diagonal states ) has been presented .",
    "this also gives a kind of a general analysis of the structure of entanglement and discord in particular of their non analytic behaviour under decoherence .",
    "however , in this work we also provide a general analysis of the various measures of quantum correlations for the states that are modeled by a two - qubit system interacting with its environment via a quantum non demolition ( purely dephasing ) as well as dissipative type of interaction .",
    "the basic motivation of the paper is three fold :    \\1 ) the primal objective is to classify the set of two qubit states modeled by a two qubit system interacting with its environment via a quantum non demolition as well as dissipative type of interaction .",
    "we categorize these density matrices into three broad divisions @xcite :",
    "\\i ) _ entangled states _ : the density matrices having positive concurrence .",
    "\\ii ) _ non classical separable states _ : the states with a non zero discord and zero concurrence ( absence of entanglement ) .",
    "\\iii ) _ classical states _ : the separable states with zero discord .    in this process of classification of the generated states our aim is to give a systematic overview of the threshold values of the dynamical parameters at which the transition from one class of states to other class is taking place .",
    "\\2 ) next , our motivation to study teleportation fidelity and bell s inequality of the states , generated by this open system model , is to find out entangled states which do not violate bell s inequality but can still be useful for teleportation .",
    "\\3 ) last but not the least our objective is to see the interface of quantum and classical correlations in the presence of dissipative decoherence . in other words , it remains interesting to study the classical as well as quantum dechorence in presence as well as absence of entanglement .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss various measures , both from a fundamental as well as an applicational perspective , of quantum correlations and try to bring out their interconnections .",
    "two - qubit systems , used here in our study of quantum correlations in mixed states , are then discussed , briefly , from the perspective of a general division of open quantum systems into a purely dephasing ( non demolition ) or dissipative evolution .",
    "this is then applied to a study of quantum correlations , followed by our discussions and conclusions .",
    "in this section we try to analyze different measures of quantum correlation and make a comparative study between them . among the measures studied are bell s inequality , concurrence and quantum discord , from a theoretical perspective .",
    "in addition , we also discuss teleportation fidelity as a measure , from an applicational point of view .",
    "bell s inequality was one of the first tools used to detect entanglement .",
    "originally , bell inequalities were introduced as an attempt to rule out local hidden variable ( lhv ) models .",
    "consider a bipartite system of two qubits where alice and bob share a particle , each supplied and initially prepared by another party , say , charlie .",
    "each of them are allowed to perform measurements on their respective particle .",
    "once alice receives her particle she performs a measurement on it .",
    "alice is provided with two sets of measurement operators and she could choose to do one of the two measurements .",
    "these are labeled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . since alice",
    "does not know in advance which measurement to apply , she adopts a random method to make her decision .",
    "let us assume that each of these measurements can have two possible values @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be the values revealed by the two measurements @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , bobs measurements are labeled by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "each of these @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can have the values @xmath9 .",
    "bob does not decide in advance which measurement he will carry out and waits until he has received the particle from alice and then chooses randomly .",
    "the setup is so arranged that they carry out their measurements in a causally connected manner .",
    "thus the principle of no signalling ensures that the measurement of one particle can not affect the measurement of the other .",
    "let us now consider the algebraic expression @xmath18 . since @xmath19 , it follows in either case that @xmath20 .",
    "now if consider the probability distribution and calculate the mean value of the above expression , then a little calculation gives the standard form of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality @xcite @xmath21=e[(m1)(m3]+e[(m2)(m3]+\\nonumber\\\\e[(m2)(m4]-e[(m1)(m4)]\\leq 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 stands for the mean value .",
    "interestingly , it can be seen that in standard quantum theory , it is always possible to design experiments for which this inequality gets violated @xcite .",
    "this shows that quantum physics violates local realism , which implies that these results can not be described by a lhv model .",
    "it may also provoke the implication that , if measurements on a quantum state violate a bell s inequality , the state is entangled .",
    "however , with the advent of the peres - horodecki criteria @xcite , the converse of this statement need not be true .",
    "one can express the most general form of bell - chsh inequality for the mixed state @xmath23 $ ] as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath27 ( where the elements of the correlation matrix @xmath2 is given by , @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 is the conjugate transpose of @xmath2 ) @xcite . as mentioned above , violation of bell s inequality for a given quantum state indicates that the state is entangled .",
    "but at the same time , there are certain entangled states which do not violate bell s inequality .",
    "since bell s inequality is not able to detect all possible entangled states , there is a need for some kind of measure which will quantify the amount of entanglement present in the system .",
    "a well known measure of entanglement is concurrence which for a two - qubit system , is equivalent to the entanglement of formation .",
    "the concurrence of a pure two - qubit state @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the partial trace of @xmath33 over subsystem b , and @xmath34 is the subsystem obtained when we trace out a. for a mixed state @xmath35 , concurrence is defined as the optimization of average concurrence of all pure state decompositions of @xmath36 , @xmath37    for a mixed state @xmath35 of two qubits , concurrence is @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the square root of the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the matrix @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 denotes complex conjugation of @xmath35 in the computational basis @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the pauli operator .",
    "the entanglement of formation ( eof ) can then be expressed as a monotonic function of concurrence c as @xmath44 thus we see that concurrence , as a function of eof , is a measure of quantum correlation as it actually quantifies the amount of entanglement present in the system .      as noted above , entanglement and quantum correlations need not be identical .",
    "quantum discord attempts to measure and quantify all quantum correlations including entanglement @xcite .    in classical information theory ,",
    "the correlation between two random variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by a quantity called ` mutual information ' @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the conditional entropy of @xmath45 given that @xmath46 has already occurred and @xmath49 is the shannon entropy of the random variable @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath50 , there exists an alternative expression for mutual information @xmath51 .",
    "classically , there is no ambiguity between these two expressions of mutual information and they are same .",
    "but a real difference arises in the quantum regime . in the quantum case ,",
    "let us consider a bipartite state @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the states of the individual subsystems .",
    "here we note that in the quantum case , shannon entropies @xmath55 are replaced by von - neumann entropies ( e.g : @xmath56 ) .",
    "now , from the definition itself the conditional entropy @xmath48 requires a specification of the state of @xmath45 given the state of @xmath46 .",
    "such a statement in quantum theory is ambiguous until the to - be - measured set of states of @xmath46 are selected .",
    "for that reason we focus on perfect measurements of y defined by a set of one dimensional projectors @xmath57 .",
    "the subscript @xmath58 is used for indexing different outcomes of this measurement .",
    "the state of x , after the measurement is given by @xmath59 with probability @xmath60 .",
    "thus , @xmath61 is the von - neumann entropy of the system in the state @xmath53 , given that projective measurement is carried out on system @xmath46 in the most general basis @xmath62 .",
    "the entropies @xmath61 weighted by the probabilities @xmath63 , yield the conditional entropy of x , given the complete set of measurements @xmath57 on y , as @xmath64 . from this ,",
    "the quantum analogue of @xmath65 is seen to be @xmath66 while @xmath67 is similar to its classical counterpart @xmath68 it is clearly evident that these two expressions are not identical in quantum theory .",
    "quantum discord is the difference between these two generalizations of classical mutual information , @xmath69 the classical correlation is given by the difference between the mutual information and quantum correlation @xmath70    we thus see from the above expression , that quantum discord aims to quantify the amount of quantum correlation that remains in the system and also points out that classicality and separability are not synonymous . in other words , it actually reveals the quantum advantage over the classical correlation .",
    "in addition to all these measures of quantum correlation one could also attempt to quantify them in terms of an application , for e.g. , fidelity of teleportation @xcite .",
    "it involves the separation of an input state into its classical and quantum part from which the state can be reconstructed with perfect fidelity @xmath71 .",
    "the basic idea is to use a pair of particles in a singlet state shared by sender ( alice ) and receiver ( bob ) .",
    "popescu @xcite noticed that pairs in a mixed state could be still useful for ( imperfect ) teleportation .",
    "consider the following general representation of the mixed state of a two - qubit system : @xmath72 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 acts on hilbert space @xmath73 , and @xmath74 stands for identity operator . here",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 are the individual hilbert spaces of the two qubits and @xmath77 with @xmath78 are the standard pauli matrices , r , s are vectors in @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the quantities @xmath81 $ ] are the coefficients of a real matrix denoted by t. this representation is most convenient when one talks about the inseparability of mixed states .",
    "in fact , all the parameters fall into two different classes : those that describe the local behavior of the state , i.e. , ( @xmath0 and @xmath82 ) , and those responsible for correlations ( t matrix ) .    in the standard teleportation scheme we have a mixed state @xmath35 acting as a quantum channel ( originally formed by pure singlet states @xcite ) .",
    "one of the particles is with bob while the other one and a third particle in an unknown state @xmath83 are subjected to joint measurement in alice s hilbert space .",
    "these measurement operators are given by a family of projectors @xmath84 where @xmath85 constitute the so - called bell basis .",
    "then using two bits alice sends bob the result of outcome k on basis of which he applies some unitary transformation @xmath86 , obtaining in this way his particle in a state k. then the fidelity of transmission of the unknown state is given by @xcite , @xmath87 where the integral is taken over all states ( indexed by the angle @xmath88 ) belonging to the bloch sphere with uniform distribution @xmath89 and @xmath90 $ ] denotes the probability of the k - th outcome .",
    "now the task is to find those unitary transformations @xmath86 that produce the highest fidelity ( a choice of a quadruple of such @xmath86 is what would be called a strategy ) .",
    "maximizing f over all strategies gives @xcite @xmath91).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the eigenvalues of @xmath94 , where @xmath95,t_{ij}=tr[\\rho(\\sigma_i\\otimes \\sigma_j)]$ ] and @xmath96 implies the conjugate transpose of @xmath2 .",
    "the classical fidelity of teleportation in the absence of entanglement is obtained as @xmath97 .",
    "thus whenever @xmath98 , teleportation is possible .",
    "at this point it is quite interesting to note that there is a non - trivial interplay between bell s inequality and teleportation fidelity .",
    "this is because both @xmath99 are dependent on the correlation matrix t. the relationship between these two quantities can be well understood in the form of the inequality @xmath100 .",
    "hence , it is clear that states which do violate bell s inequality are always useful for teleportation .",
    "however , interestingly , this does not rule out the possibility of existence of entangled states that do not violate bell s inequality , but can still be useful for teleportation .",
    "indeed , we discuss below examples of such states .",
    "open quantum systems is the study of evolution of the system of interest taking into account its interaction with the environment ( reservoir or bath ) . let the total hamiltonian be @xmath101 , where",
    "@xmath6 stands for the system , @xmath89 for the reservoir and @xmath102 for the system - reservoir interaction .",

    "also , we look for realistic open system models that generate entangled states which can be useful for teleportation , but at the same time , not violate bell s inequality . finally in presence of dissipative decoherence we make a comparative study of the quantum and classical correlation .",
    "interestingly we find that after a certain time the rate of quantum as well as classical dechoerence becomes identical .",
    "an analogous study for non dissipative systems was made in @xcite .",
    "here we study examples of two - qubit density matrices obtained as a result of qnd evolution , in both the collective as well as independent ( localized ) regimes of the model .",
    "teleportation fidelity @xmath178 , violation of bell s inequality @xmath179 , concurrence @xmath181 and discord are examined for these states as a function of various parameters like : bath squeezing parameter @xmath0 , inter - qubit spacing @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 and system - bath interaction time @xmath3 .",
    "we categorize these density matrices into three broad categories : 1 ) entangled states , 2 ) separable non classical states and 3 ) classical states .",
    "we specifically mention the range of the dynamical parameters for which such a classification is possible .",
    "we also report cases where these two qubit states are entangled states , but do not violate bell s inequality and still can be useful for teleportation with a fidelity better than the classical fidelity of teleportation .",
    "the first example considers two - qubit density matrices , from the collective model , as illustrated in figs .",

    "( [ fig2](a ) ) is zero , discord is non - zero .",
    "thus we conclude that the states obtained in this independent model are non classical separable states for the above range of the bath squeezing parameter @xmath0 .",

    "for the parameters chosen , we see a similar pattern of the various correlation functions as in the previous figure , i.e. , with the exception of discord , the quantum correlation measures fall with the increase in bath squeezing .",

    "( [ fig4](d ) ) , a positive discord is seen for the complete range of @xmath1 , even in the range where there is no entanglement ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "interestingly , we see that discord attains a constant value @xmath191 in this range .",
    "we conclude from this non zero value of discord even in the absence of entanglement that the states in this range are non classical separable states .",
    "figure ( [ fig4](b ) ) illustrates that @xmath192 , for all values of @xmath1 except where there is no entanglement . in the absence of entanglement",
    "the teleportation fidelity attains the constant value @xmath97 .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "( [ fig4](c ) ) we find that @xmath24 for all values of @xmath1 and attains a constant value @xmath193 in the absence of entanglement .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that these states can be useful for teleportation despite the fact that they satisfy bell s inequality .    as a function of the inter - qubit distance",
    ", the various correlation measures exhibit oscillatory behavior , in the collective regime of the model , but flatten out subsequently to attain almost constant values in the independent regime of the model .",
    "this oscillatory behavior is due to the strong collective behavior exhibited by the dynamics due to the relatively close proximity of the qubits in the collective regime @xcite .",
    "next , we study the behavior of quantum correlations , in two - qubit density matrices in the collective regime of the model , with respect to the evolution time @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig5](a ) ) , concurrence is seen to exhibit damped oscillations . here",
    "we see that the states are entangled initially until the time evolution parameter @xmath3 reaches the value @xmath194 . figure ( [ fig5](b ) ) , for teleportation fidelity @xmath195 , also shows a damped behavior and can be seen , in general , to be greater than @xmath97 , except for the range @xmath196 where there is no entanglement ( zero concurrence ) , where it attains a constant value @xmath97 . from fig .",

    "discord , as in fig .",
    "( [ fig5](d ) ) , is always positive , though its value is decreasing with time .",
    "we conclude from the figure that the states that are generated in the collective regime are initially entangled but after a certain value of the time evolution parameter @xmath197 , the states produced are no longer entangled but are non classical separable states .",
    "the threshold value of the discord at @xmath197 is @xmath198 .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) , we have an example of mixed states , belonging to the collective regime of the dissipative two - qubit model , where concurrence is zero for all values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these states satisfy bell s inequality , as is evident from ( [ fig6](c ) ) ( it takes a constant value @xmath199 ) , but teleportation fidelity , fig .",
    "( [ fig6](b ) ) , is equal to @xmath200 , which is consistent with our understanding that states that are not entangled can not be used for teleportation .",
