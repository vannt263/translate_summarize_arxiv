    "there exist several physical problems where the use of simple perturbative methods seems to be deemed to failure from the start . in these cases , already in the leading perturbative correction , one faces singular terms which render the perturbative expansion meaningless , no matter how small the initial expansion parameter is .",
    "the great success of the renormalization group ( rg ) has been to turn , at least in a number of highly non - trivial cases , this apparent failure into a powerful tool .",
    "the rg conceptual scheme @xcite teaches us how singular terms , arising in the perturbative expansion , give rise to the power - law and scaling behaviors characteristic of the critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "this is the most successful use of the rg , which we only briefly recall in sec .",
    "[ hist ] . in particular",
    ", we introduce the basic elements of the rg approach such as universality , scaling , relevant and irrelevant variables , and discuss the wilson@xcite and the field - theoretic rg@xcite , which can be seen as two different implementations of universality .",
    "the origin of a singular perturbation theory is understood within the @xmath0 model for critical phenomena , where @xmath1 is the field whose thermal average specifies the order parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dimensionless effective coupling constant which appears in perturbation theory in @xmath3 spatial dimensions is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the coupling constant describing the self - interaction of the fluctuations of the field @xmath7 , and @xmath8 measures the deviation of the temperature @xmath9 from the critical temperature @xmath10 .",
    "this leads to a divergence when approaching criticality ( @xmath11 ) , for @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) [ for the corresponding power counting , leading to the expression of the dimensionless coupling constant given above , see fig .",
    "[ diagr](a ) ] .",
    "the rg sums the leading singularities into power laws for the order parameter @xmath14 , for the susceptibility @xmath15 , which measures the linear response to its conjugate external field @xmath16 , for the specific heat @xmath17 , etc . here , @xmath18 ...",
    "are called the critical exponents , or critical indices .",
    "we will also turn our attention to different uses of the rg approach .",
    "one class of such applications is met when the critical behavior is _",
    "unconventional_. this may occur , for instance , when it is difficult to identify the order parameter ( which can be a complicated object , or a composite operator ) and the related broken symmetry .",
    "the problem of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in a disordered interacting electron system is an important example of this class @xcite . in this case",
    "the symmetries of the physical problem may provide the guiding framework to identify the effective theory .",
    "these symmetries can be translated into ward identities which establish relations among the various terms of the skeleton structure of the problem , simplifying the rg treatment .",
    "the use of the rg , however , is not limited to the critical behavior .",
    "it turns out to be extremely useful also in the stable phases .",
    "indeed , there are cases in which a divergent perturbation theory is the result of relevant low - lying excitations in low - dimensional systems , despite the fact that the system is in a stable liquid phase of the matter .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , of the luttinger liquid in one - dimensional interacting fermi systems @xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ diagr](b ) ] , or of bose liquids in the superfluid phase for @xmath19 @xcite [ see fig . [ diagr](c),(d ) ] .",
    "the very condition of phase stability implies that the susceptibilities ( e.g. , specific heat , spin susceptibility , compressibility , etc . )",
    "are finite , and the exact cancellation of the singular contributions is controlled by ward identities .",
    "nonetheless , as we shall show , a track of the singularities is usually left in the power - law behavior of some one - particle physical quantities .    in the following",
    ", we will touch upon all these examples , often stressing the key role played in practice by the ward identities which implement the fundamental symmetries of the physical system at hand , and for the last two cases allow for a complete solution of the low - lying excitation problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ hist ] , we recall a few basic concepts about the rg and how ward identities may be used to carry out the renormalization program . in sec .",
    "[ rgsp ] , we discuss the application of rg to stable phases . first , in sec .",
    "[ llfl ] , we examine the case of interacting fermions in one @xcite and low dimensions @xcite . then , in sec .",
    "[ ibld ] , we analyze the problem of interacting bosons @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ mit ] , we focus our attention on the problem of disordered interacting fermi systems @xcite .",
    "the first aspect that must be appreciated by looking at the historical development of the rg is the change of perspective with respect to the reduction scheme which , before its introduction , was at work in formulating a condensed - matter theory .",
    "the fifties and the sixties of the past century had seen the flourishing of the quasiparticle concept . according to this ,",
    "an interacting system may be effectively described in terms of `` almost '' independent elementary excitations ( quasiparticles ) .",
    "implicit in this attitude is the privileged role reserved to the `` approximate '' solution of the dynamical problem and to the development of the many - body theory , with respect to the statistical aspects . in the late sixties and early seventies , the realization of the importance of the large - scale fluctuations in approaching the critical point shifted the attention onto the statistical problem @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the correlation length @xmath20 , when @xmath11 , implies the strong correlation of a large number of degrees of freedom within a region of an increasing linear size @xmath21 , and then invalidates the previous quasiparticle - based reduction schemes . the collective critical phenomenon does not arise as a simple superposition of single microscopic events . through the action of ordering forces",
    ", the probability distribution of the collective variables no longer obeys the central limit theorem , according to which the correct normalization for an extensive variable is provided by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this violation , via an anomalous normalization of block variables , is the mathematical manifestation of the existence of correlations at all length scales , so that the crucial hypothesis of statistical independence becomes progressively not applicable getting closer to the critical point .",
    "the very fact that @xmath22 when approaching criticality , while invalidating the previous reduction schemes , provides the crucial key for the new reduction scheme , i.e. , universality @xcite .",
    "there are two equivalent forms of universality .",
    "first of all , the microscopic details which specify the peculiarities of each individual system become gradually irrelevant when approaching criticality , and the infinitely large number of degrees of freedom involved is well accounted for by a small set of relevant variables .",
    "once the proper choice of the relevant variables is made ( e.g. , @xmath23 and @xmath16 or @xmath7 ) , one can change the parameters @xmath24 which specify the microscopic details ( unless they assume a value which changes the symmetry of the problem , thus becoming relevant ) , without changing the critical behavior of the system .",
    "said in other words , systems which differ in the irrelevant variables share the same critical behavior @xcite .",
    "this condition translates into the invariance of the ( singular part of the ) free energy @xmath25 , or equivalently of its legendre transform @xmath26 , @xmath27 i.e. , a suitable rescaling of the relevant variables fully accounts for a change in the irrelevant variables .",
    "the second form of universality relies on the fact that the unit length scale is irrelevant when @xmath22 .",
    "this is translated into the statement that one can eliminate the degrees of freedom at short distance , by grouping microscopic variables into `` block variables '' , within an iterated procedure to build larger and larger blocks , without changing the critical behavior of the system @xcite .",
    "the field - theoretic rg equations generalize the universality relations in the sense that they relate one model system to another by varying the coupling constant @xmath28 and suitably rescaling the other variables and the correlation functions @xcite . in ordinary critical phenomena , described by the @xmath0 theory , @xmath7 ( wave - function ) and @xmath23 ( mass )",
    "must be rescaled .",
    "when the coupling reaches its fixed point , a two - parameter scaling follows .",
    "the wilson new rg implements the second idea of universality illustrated above , by eliminating the short - wavelength fluctuations of the field @xmath7 , i.e. , those with characteristic momenta @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ultraviolet cutoff , and @xmath31 is the scaling parameter @xcite .",
    "the real space version of the wilson rg implementation is the bloc variable transformation@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the critical indices was performed either numerically , through recurrence equations , or analytically , within the @xmath32 expansion @xcite .",
    "this latter procedure relies on the perturbative expansion of the rg transformation in the parameter @xmath5 , starting from the known case @xmath33 .",
    "the direct calculation of the divergent critical quantities is thus avoided .",
    "in general , a sets of parameters @xmath34 specifies a given hamiltonian @xmath35 in the space @xmath36 of the hamiltonians . the action of the rg transformation @xmath37 ( which depends on the scaling parameter @xmath31 ) in this space preserves the functional @xmath38 , so that symbolically @xcite : @xmath39=\\gamma[h].\\ ] ] the above equation can be written in a differential form as @xmath40 the functional derivatives of @xmath38 yield the group equations for all the physical quantities .",
    "a fixed point of the transformation is such that @xmath41 $ ] . at criticality @xmath42",
    "and it remains infinite under iteration of rg transformations .",
    "by iteration of the group transformation on the critical surface one model hamiltonian is transformed into another , until a fixed - point simplified hamiltonian is reached as @xmath43 , which is manifestly scale invariant , and all the irrelevant transient terms have been eliminated .",
    "the relevant parameters define a finite set of relevant directions of escape from a given fixed point @xcite , and their scale dependence gives a microscopic definition of the critical indices .",
    "universality corresponds to the domain of attraction of a given fixed point . within a given domain ,",
    "the transformations become asymptotically equivalent@xcite .",
    "standard renormalizability implies that the removal of the ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the lattice spacing or some other microscopic characteristic length scale ) only requires the definition of a finite ( small ) set of renormalized parameters .",
    "relevant parameters and renormalized parameters coincide asymptotically in the infrared region .    here",
    "a general problem arises .",
    "recently , a renewed attention has been devoted to the exact rg equations @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , one has to truncate these equations or reduce the number of flow parameters . in this last case",
    ", one has to initialize the action to follow a renormalized trajectory with a small number of flowing parameters , and an infinite set of parameters in the action must be specified .",
    "this specification is a highly non - perturbative condition .    in practice , therefore , one should rather choose the best simple action , guided by the symmetries of the problem and by the physical conditions .",
    "the knowledge of the fundamental symmetries inherent to each specific problem , and in particular those of the order parameter , have to be assumed in order to make the proper choice of the basic variables on which the rg transformation acts .",
    "the rg approach takes enormous advantage from the explicit implementation of the symmetries of the original problem , which translate into ward identities relating various independent quantities .",
    "first of all , the ward identities allow for a reduction of the renormalization parameters .",
    "the case of quantum electrodynamics is a textbook example .",
    "the local @xmath46 gauge invariance of the lagrangian , which is invariant under the simultaneous transformation of the phonon field @xmath47 and of the fermion field @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the gauge field , allows to relate the self - energy and vertex renormalizations , whose corrections correspond to superficially divergent diagrams within perturbation theory in @xmath50 dimensions .    secondly , the ward identities provide the guiding framework for the identification of the proper running variables ( effective coupling constants ) , and how they are related to physical quantities",
    ". we will consider the case of disordered interacting electron systems .",
    "as we shall see , the various interaction amplitudes are dressed by disorder .",
    "the renormalization parameters of the corresponding field - theoretical formulation of the problem ( the non - linear @xmath51-model @xcite ) are identified in terms of physical quantities of the fermi - liquid theory by requiring the gauge invariance of the skeleton structure of the response functions @xcite .",
    "finally , the ward identities control the exact cancellation of the singularities in the various response functions within stable phases , despite a singular perturbation theory . in these cases , indeed , specific symmetries are related to additional ward identities , which enforce the cancellations .",
    "the combination of the three procedures indicated above leads to the asymptotically exact description of : the luttinger liquid in @xmath52 @xcite , and its crossover to the fermi liquid in @xmath53 @xcite ; the non - fermi - liquid behavior of an interacting electron system with singular forward scattering in @xmath53 @xcite ; the bose liquid in the presence of the bose - einstein condensate @xcite ; the disordered interacting electron systems @xcite . in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] we provide a scheme of the symmetries and ward identities which are relevant in the various physical problems discussed in this paper .",
    "each specific system has been discussed at length in several papers .",
    "we emphasize here the general common aspects and give a unifying view of these apparently very different theoretical problems .",
    "as we have already indicated in sec . [ intro ] , there are cases where the perturbation theory is singular even in a stable phase .",
    "we first recall here the case of the luttinger liquid in one dimension , its dimensional crossover to a fermi liquid as soon as @xmath53 in the presence of short range forces , and the non - fermi - liquid behavior when the forces among the fermions are sufficiently singular .",
    "we then consider the low - lying excitations from a ground state of bosons in the presence of interaction , where the condensate changes the power counting and leads to singular terms in perturbation theory for @xmath54 .",
    "the use of the rg , in these cases , acquires a different meaning with respect to critical phenomena , as the thermodynamic stability implies here a cancellation of singularities at any order in perturbation theory in all the susceptibilities , like specific heat , compressibility , etc . behind these exact cancellations",
    "there must be specific symmetry properties , which can be used in the form of ward identities to close the hierarchy of rg equations and solve the problem .",
    "although a stable system is characterized by finite response functions , the re - summation of singularities may still manifest itself with an anomalous dimension as in the one - particle fermion green s function .      within a rg approach ,",
    "the effective low - energy hamiltonian which describes a metallic system can be obtained via the wilson - like iterative elimination of states outside a shell of thickness @xmath30 around the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "as @xmath30 is iteratively scaled to zero a fixed point is reached in @xmath55 which corresponds to a gas of quasiparticles with finite residual hartree - like interaction , described by the landau functional .",
    "ordinary three - dimensional metals are thus well described by the landau fermi - liquid theory @xcite . the interaction is effectively taken into account in the various response function through a small set of landau parameters , entering the physical quantities , e.g. , the specific - heat coefficient @xmath56 , the spin susceptibility @xmath57 , the compressibility @xmath58 , and the spectral weight of the drude peak in the optical conductivity , all of them being finite .",
    "a finite wave - function renormalization @xmath59 reduces the discontinuity of the occupation number in momentum space at the fermi surface with respect to the value of the fermi gas ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the elementary excitations of the system are the single - particle excitations ( quasiparticles ) , which carry both charge and spin , and the collective charge and spin modes , which get overdamped when they enter the particle - hole continuum of excitations .    in recent times",
    ", the interest for non - fermi - liquid metallic phases has been rekindled by the observation of anomalous features in single - particle and transport properties of the cuprates , which have been interpreted as a signature of non - fermi - liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "these compounds are layered ( quasi - two - dimensional ) materials , which are insulating when stoichiometric , and become metallic upon chemical doping .",
    "the metallic phase is strongly anomalous at low doping and gradually ( and smoothly ) evolves towards a fermi - liquid - like metal at large doping .",
    "the breakdown of the fermi liquid could be produced by the suppression of quasiparticle spectral weight at the fermi surface due to the generation of an interaction - induced anomalous dimension in the wave - function renormalization , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 measures the deviation of the quasiparticle momentum @xmath63 from the fermi momentum @xmath64 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath65 vanishes as @xmath66 , the low - lying single - particle excitations are completely suppressed , and the low - energy behavior of the system is dominated by the charge and spin collective modes . since these have , in general , different velocities , the system is characterized by the so - called charge and spin separation .",
    "this behavior is achieved in @xmath52 , where the metallic phase is a luttinger liquid .",
    "the hint for the breakdown of the fermi - liquid picture is given by the appearance of logarithmic singularities in perturbation theory as @xmath66 [ see fig . [",
    "diagr](b ) ] .",
    "these singularities are controlled by the rg , and an effective field theory results , with marginal forward scattering , the so - called luttinger model , which is exactly solvable .",
    "additional conservation laws , which are peculiar to one - dimensional systems with forward scattering , constrain the model and lead to a closure of the equations of motion .",
    "indeed , the total charge and spin conservation is translated into the usual ward identity @xmath67 which connects the irreducible density ( @xmath68 ) and current ( @xmath69 ) vertices to the electronic green s function @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , in this case , charge and spin are separately conserved at each fermi point @xmath71 , leading to an additional ward identity @xcite stating the proportionality of the current vertex to the density vertex , due to the unique momentum direction , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fermi velocity and the direction versor @xmath74 here ( @xmath75 is @xmath76 . by means of the two ward identities",
    "( [ usualwi ] ) and ( [ newwi ] ) one is able to express the density vertex @xmath68 as a function of the fermion propagator @xmath70 , thus closing the dyson equation of fig .",
    "[ dysonfig ] .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath77 ( which is represented by the tick - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ dysonfig ] ) contains the charge and spin collective modes via the rpa re - summation of the bare interaction with the fermion polarization bubble .",
    "the rpa re - summation is shown to be exact by the use of the same ward identities ( [ usualwi ] ) and ( [ newwi ] ) . as a result density and spin response functions are finite , leading to a stable metallic phase .",
    "on the contrary , from the exact evaluation of @xmath70 one finds that its behavior is controlled by a non - universal anomalous dimension @xmath78 .",
    "single particles hence move as composite objects due to the strong mixing with the charge and spin collective modes , induced by the effective interaction .",
    "the question then arises whether the luttinger - liquid behavior can be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "the analysis of the dimensional crossover shows that this is not possible if the interactions are short - ranged .",
    "indeed , the generic integrals in @xmath3 dimensions @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the solid angle in @xmath81 dimensions , are strongly peaked at @xmath82 for @xmath83 , so that all the relevant vectors are still parallel or antiparallel . in this case , the additional ward identity ( [ newwi ] ) is still valid asymptotically near the fermi surface .",
    "however , the mixing with the collective modes is reduced as soon as @xmath53 , since the effective interaction @xmath84 is averaged over the @xmath81 momentum components perpendicular to the fermi momentum .",
    "the effective interaction , which is marginal in @xmath52 , scales to zero for @xmath53 , and the system is a fermi liquid .    however , if we consider a long - range bare interaction among the fermions , @xmath85 , the effective interaction dressed by the rpa series is @xmath86 and is dominated by a collective mode @xmath87 , which is propagating and gapless for @xmath88 ( the parameter @xmath89 depends on the microscopic parameters of the fermion model , and does not acquire singular corrections , see below ) .",
    "this singular behavior as @xmath90 compensates the rescaling to zero of the effective interaction due to its averaging over the transverse momentum and leads to a non - fermi - liquid behavior for @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "a singular interaction may appear in a system close to an instability , due to the coupling of the fermion quasiparticles with the critical fluctuations .",
    "various proposals for the breakdown of the fermi - liquid picture in the cuprates rely on the existence of a quantum critical point in their phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the problem of fermions interacting via a singular interaction is plagued by infrared divergences and requires a proper rg treatment , supported by the ward identities @xcite .",
    "the vertex @xmath68 induces a coupling constant @xmath92 which in principle contains the divergences of the vertex ( which requires the renormalization @xmath93 ) , of the fermion propagator ( renormalized by @xmath65 ) and of the collective - mode propagator @xmath77 ( renormalized by @xmath94 ) .",
    "the coupling is accordingly renormalized as @xmath95 .",
    "however , the total charge conservation translated into the usual ward identity ( [ usualwi ] ) , gives , in the dynamic limit , @xmath96 moreover , since small-@xmath97 scattering dominates , the charge is asymptotically conserved at each point of the fermi surface , leading to the additional ward identity ( [ newwi ] ) .",
    "when the vertex @xmath68 is accordingly expressed in terms of the fermion propagator @xmath70 , one realizes that the effective interaction @xmath77 , i.e. , the collective - mode propagator ( [ efflr ] ) does not get anomalous corrections beyond the rpa approximation , i.e. , @xmath98 . in fact , the vertex corrections to the bare polarization bubble asymptotically cancel with the selfenergy corrections , thank to the additional ward identity ( [ newwi ] ) .    therefore , together with eq .",
    "( [ zvz ] ) , this implies that @xmath99 , and the dimensionless running coupling constant @xmath100 , where @xmath31 is some infrared cutoff which plays the role of the scaling parameter , evolves under rg with its bare dimension @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "therefore at the dimension @xmath103 the coupling is marginal ( @xmath104 ) . for @xmath105",
    "the bare dimension @xmath106 is positive , the theory scales to strong coupling and the fermi liquid breaks down .",
    "finally , for @xmath107 , @xmath106 is negative and the effective coupling scales to zero .",
    "thus @xmath65 stays finite and the system is a fermi liquid .    from the one - loop perturbative rg ,",
    "one finds the explicit form of the wave - function renormalization as a function , e.g. , of the quasiparticle energy @xmath108 . at @xmath109 , @xmath110 , vanishes with a non - universal exponent @xmath111 , as in the luttinger liquid . for @xmath105 ,",

    "if the initial value of @xmath281 is not too large , @xmath23 initially grows until the growth of @xmath281 makes the triplet contribution the dominating one . as a result",
    ", @xmath23 has a maximum as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "however , due to the strong - coupling runway of @xmath281 , one can not seriously trust the above equations quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless , the physical indication of some type of ferromagnetic instability is rather clear due to the diverging spin susceptibility associated with @xmath282 .",
    "furthermore , the dominating antilocalizing effect of the triplet while @xmath23 remains finite , strongly supports the possibility of a metallic phase at low temperature , in contrast with the non - interacting theory based on wl only @xcite . indeed , this metallic phase in @xmath283 has been recently observed ( see refs . in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , due to the divergence of @xmath282 also @xmath65 goes to the strong coupling regime , leading to an enhancement of the specific heat , which is however hardly observable in two dimensions .    in three dimensions ( see fig .",
    "[ rgflow3 ] ) one has a richer scenario depending on the initial values of the running couplings .",
    "the main difference is that there exists a critical line in the @xmath284 plane asymptotically given by @xmath285 , where under the rg flow @xmath286 , @xmath287 with their product being constant . on the weak - disorder side of this line ,",
    "the system scales to a conductor with vanishing @xmath23 , whereas on the strong - disorder side the system behaves qualitatively as in the two - dimensional case discussed above , leaving again the possibility open for a ferromagnetic instability at a finite scale . in this latter case",
    ", however , the strong - coupling runaway flow requires to go beyond the one - loop approximation we have presented here leaving the problem of the proper treatment of the metal - insulator transition still open .",
    "an approximate treatment of the two - loop correction is possible , but its discussion is well outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    ". however , we remark that , whenever there is a reduction of the effect of the triplet channel , due to a magnetic coupling altering the symmetry , as in the presence of a magnetic field with zeeman spin - splitting @xcite , spin - flip scattering@xcite or spin - orbit scattering @xcite one obtains a _ bona - fide _ mit with different universality classes with respect to the anderson localization . for a comparison with the experiments see , e.g. , ref . @xcite .",
    "we finally emphasize that , as in the interacting boson case , the perturbative rg at one loop confirms the conclusions drawn by the implementation of the ward identities .",
    "however , in the present case , since we are dealing with critical behavior , the singularities are resummed in power laws , rather than to be cancelled as required in a stable liquid phase .",
    "mathematically this manifests in the lack of additional symmetries which prevents us from closing the equations of motion and solving the problem exactly .",
    "we have achieved , however , via the ward identities , that the remaining singularities describe the critical behavior of the specific heat , spin susceptibility , and of the coupling @xmath23 related to the conductance .",
