    "the jacobi ensemble , like the wishart ensemble , has its roots in the field of multivariate statistics . to quantify the empirically estimated canonical correlation coefficients between two sets of time series ,",
    "they are compared to a null hypothesis , i.e. to a gaussian distribution .",
    "assuming for both sets gaussian statistics with a non - trivial correlation structure , the null hypothesis becomes the jacobi model  @xcite . besides the canonical correlation analysis it applies also to other aspects of high - dimensional inference such as analysis of variances , regression analysis and the test of equality of covariance matrices  @xcite .",
    "consequently , they are also referred to as manova ( * m*ultivariate * an*alysis * o*f * va*riance ) ensembles .",
    "along with the gaussian ( wigner ) and the laguerre ( uncorrelated - wishart ) ensembles , the jacobi ensemble constitutes the family of classical random matrix ensembles .",
    "just as the eigenvalue statistics for wigner and wishart ensembles respectively involve hermite polynomials and associated laguerre polynomials , the eigenvalue statistics of jacobi ensembles involve jacobi polynomials .",
    "together they complete the random matrix ensemble picture in connection with the theory of classical orthogonal , and skew - orthogonal polynomials  @xcite .",
    "closely related to these classical ensembles is the less known cauchy - lorentz ensemble  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a levy tail and therefore finds important applications in the spectral statistics of covariance matrices in finance  @xcite .    besides their crucial role in multivariate statistics and the intimate connection with the theory of classical polynomials , jacobi ensembles find interesting applications in the fields of quantum transport and optical fibre communication . in the context of quantum transport , they describe the statistics of transmission ( or reflection ) eigenvalues for disordered mesoscopic systems with _ ideal leads _ , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the knowledge of these eigenvalues , in turn , gives access to important observables such as landauer conductance , shot - noise power and wigner delay time  @xcite .",
    "this connection of jacobi ensembles with the transmission eigenvalues stems from their relationship with the scattering matrices which are modelled using dyson s circular ensembles  @xcite .",
    "more recently jacobi ensembles have been used in the ergodic capacity analysis of multiple - input - multiple - output optical fibre communication  @xcite . in this case",
    "the jacobi structure emerges from the channel matrix which happens to be a block of a bigger transfer matrix which is unitary in nature .    in all these applications listed above one",
    "can ask about intrinsic correlations of the channels or time series which result in correlated random matrix ensembles . thus one has to relax the condition of the empirical correlation matrix being proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "this correlation can be attributed to different reasons depending on the context .",
    "for instance , in time - series analysis data are in general mutually correlated , e.g. see  @xcite . in the context of multiple antenna communication ,",
    "this correlation arises because of spatial correlation between closely spaced antennas  @xcite as it is the case in any cellphone . to handle these situations matrix models with correlations between different time series  @xcite , even with double correlations  @xcite ,",
    "have been introduced ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in the wishart case",
    "the level density of the model correlation matrix was computed by various techniques .",
    "we pursue the ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite where supersymmetry techniques were employed .    in the case of the jacobi and the cauchy - lorentz ensemble",
    "not much progress has been made in a similar direction as for the gaussian because of their non - gaussian form .",
    "nonetheless both models can be traced back to a combination of two random matrices both drawn from wishart ensembles , as explained in detail in sections  [ sec - jac ] and  [ sec : jcl ] . to each of the two wishart matrices",
    "one can associate an empirical covariance matrix .",
    "however , we show in section  [ sec - jac ] that effectively only one empirical correlation matrix is involved .",
    "in section  [ sec - jac ] we briefly review the jacobi ensemble before showing the relation to the cauchy - lorentz ensemble in section  [ sec : cje : lorentzianmodel ] .",
    "the latter is more convenient to apply the projection formula  @xcite and the supersymmetry approach .",
    "nevertheless we present in appendix  [ sec : cje : twosupermatrixmodel ] an alternative approach which is a direct way from the integral over the jacobi ensemble to an integral over superspace .",
    "the resulting supersymmetric integral is more involved than the one resulting from the first approach because it involves two supermatrices instead of only one .",
    "however the second approach exhibits an intrinsic symmetry of the model which is not obvious in the more compact result presented in section  [ sec : cje : lorentzianmodel ] . in section  [ sec : cje : complexcase ] we calculate the whole eigenvalue statistics of the correlated complex jacobi and the correlated complex cauchy - lorentz ensemble .",
    "this is possible due to an underlying determinantal point process .",
    "such an integrable structure is not available for the real case discussed in section  [ sec : cje : realcase ] . for this case",
    "we need the supersymmetric representation and compute the level density with the help of the generalized hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "some details of this calculation are presented in appendix  [ app : expl ] . in section [ sec : saddlepoint ] , we discuss the level density for the real and the complex ensemble in the limit of large matrix sizes in a unified way .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this section is devoted to introduce the theoretical background .",
    "the correlated jacobi ensemble is a two - matrix model for a hermitian matrix @xmath2 which is composed of two independently distributed correlated wishart matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 the rectangular matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same number of rows @xmath8 ( the number of time series ) but may have a different number of columns @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the number of time steps ) , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in a realistic situation for time series analysis both dimensions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are indeed larger than @xmath8 since the number of time steps is usually larger than the number of time series .",
    "moreover the matrix entries @xmath13 are distributed as gaussians with variances @xmath14_{ji}$ ] such that the distribution reads @xmath15 and likewise for @xmath7 , where we introduce @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the dyson index meaning that @xmath19 corresponds to real matrices whereas @xmath17 denotes complex matrices .",
    "the case of quaternion matrices ( @xmath21 ) is not considered here but can be in general worked out in a similar way .",
    "the empirical correlation matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed as in the discussions of @xcite .",
    "because of the distribution   the random matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 have upon average the same covariances as the sample , @xmath24 the angular brackets denote the average over the random matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we note that instead of the matrix model ( [ eq : cje : defh ] ) one can also consider the matrix model @xmath25 . in that case",
    "the eigenvalues lie in the interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "these two matrix models are related by a scaling and a shift transformation .",
    "we work here with the matrix model ( [ eq : cje : defh ] ) and thus relate directly to the jacobi weight . because of the involvement of two wishart matrices in the jacobi model , it is also known as the double wishart model .",
    "the spectral statistics of @xmath27 can be studied via partition functions which are averages over products and ratios of characteristic polynomials , see e.g.  @xcite , @xmath28 \\frac{\\prod_{a=1}^{k_2 } \\det\\left(h - \\kappa_{a2}{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1 } } _ { p}\\right)}{\\prod_{b=1}^{k_1 } \\det\\left(h- \\kappa_{b1 }   { \\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1}}_{p}\\right ) }   p(f|c_f)p(b|c_b).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] those partition functions are related to the @xmath0-point correlation functions as @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "we underline that this definition of the @xmath0-point correlation function comprises self - energy terms , in particular terms proportional to @xmath31 . despite those terms",
    "the definition   is very helpful when the joint probability density of the eigenvalues is not explicitly known as it is in the case of the correlated real ensembles discussed in section  [ sec : cje : realcase ] .    in the case",
    "when the joint probability density is known one can apply another definition of the @xmath0-point correlation function , e.g. see @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of @xmath27 .",
    "this definition is employed to the correlated complex ensembles studied in section  [ sec : cje : complexcase ] .",
    "both definitions are normalized in such a way that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the eigenvalue density of @xmath36",
    "is given by the case @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath37 it is computed in sections  [ sec : cje : complexcase ] and [ sec : cje : realcase ] .    the partition function   is normalized as @xmath38 . note that in the case @xmath39 , the partition function and , hence , the spectral statistics of @xmath27 become independent of the empirical covariance matrices such that the joint eigenvalue distribution of @xmath27 is given by the uncorrelated jacobi ensemble @xcite .",
    "indeed we can rescale the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that the partition function only depends on @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 \\frac{\\prod_{a=1}^{k_2 } \\det\\left(h - \\kappa_{a2}{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1}}_{p}\\right)}{\\prod_{b=1}^{k_1 } \\det\\left(h- \\kappa_{b1}{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1}}_{p}\\right ) }   p(f|{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\kern-3.8pt\\normalsize1}}_{p})p(b|c_{\\text{eff } } ) .",

    "thus , it is reasonable to apply other methods than the standard jack or zonal polynomial approach @xcite .",
    "the correlated jacobi ensemble is also related to the correlated cauchy - lorentz ensemble .",
    "this relation is established in subsection  [ sec : jcl ] . with the help of this relation",
    "we express the partition function   in terms of integrals over supermatrices in subsection  [ sec : proj ] .",
    "the advantage of the supersymmetric integrals is the drastic reduction of integration variables .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 only appear as external parameters in those expressions .",
    "this fact allows an asymptotic study when these parameters are large which is considered in section  [ sec : saddlepoint ] .      to see the relation between the jacobi and the cauchy - lorentz ensembles we take advantage of the fact that @xmath3 is generically invertible because @xmath45 .",
