    "the best studied darboux transformations are those that are obtained from a number of linearly independent solutions through the wronskian formulas . in this way one can construct darboux transformations for equations of a very general form  @xcite . for practical purposes one would want to have other types of darboux transformations too , since 1 )",
    "the transformations of wronskian type are not invertible ; 2 ) the other popular special case of darboux transformations - two laplace transformations - is not in this class ( in particular they are invertible ) .",
    "recall that the laplace transformations are two transformations defined for a very special type of equations , namely , second order hyperbolic equations in two independent variables .",
    "they are related to factorizations of the corresponding operator .",
    "the known laplace transformation method is based on the fact that laplace transformations can be described by transformations of the corresponding gauge invariants .",
    "after a long history  @xcite , the hypothesis that can be traced back to darboux was proved  @xcite that the darboux transformations of any order for such equations are either of wronskian type , or can be decomposed into a product of laplace transformations .    in  @xcite it was first noted that 1 ) there are a number of examples of operators of third order of two independent variables where the `` wronskian '' method fails ; 2 ) there are a number of examples of operators of third order of two independent variables which admit invertible darboux transformations . in this case",
    "we can not pose the question whether these invertible transformations are a product of laplace transformations or not , since laplace transformations only defined for the equation mentioned above .",
    "in  @xcite we suggested an algebraic formalism for darboux transformations . in  @xcite for operators of arbitrary orders and depending in arbitrary number of independent variables we singled out a class of invertible darboux transformations ",

    "following an analogy with laplace transformations , in this paper we describe the orbits of darboux transformations of type i in terms of differential invariants .",

    "if we fix the principal symbol of auxiliary operator @xmath1 ( for example , @xmath2 ) and consider all possible darboux transformations of type i with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a parameter , then all of them just transform @xmath0 into operators that differ by a gauge transformations .",
    "we obtained the exact formulas in terms of differential invariants using the generating set found in  @xcite .",
