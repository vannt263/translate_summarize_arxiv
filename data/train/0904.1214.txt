    "in a linear oscillator , perturbations that change the phase but do not cause the oscillator to deviate from its stable trajectory , _ _ i.e. _ _ , perturbations _ _ along _ _ the stable trajectory , cause phase noise only .",
    "similarly , perturbations _ _ transverse _ _ to the stable trajectory cause amplitude noise only , since the frequency of oscillation is independent of amplitude .",
    "unlike in a linear oscillator , the frequency of an sto depends on the amplitude of oscillation @xcite , with important consequences for phase noise @xcite . during the time",
    "the sto is perturbed away from its stable trajectory , the magnetization moves at a different rate , so when it returns to the stable trajectory it will be either advanced or retarded relative to its unperturbed motion . as a consequence , deviations from the stable trajectory result in both amplitude and phase noise . in the equation for @xmath23 , both @xmath18 and @xmath21",
    "are affected by transverse perturbations , but it is sufficient to measure either one to detect these perturbations .",
    "computation of the fourier transform of @xmath21 is slightly complicated by the fact the the times @xmath63 at which @xmath33 is measured are not uniformly spaced . for oscillators with low phase noise",
    "it is appropriate to proceed by assuming that the phase change within one period is small ( < < 1 rad ) and then interpolating from the actual times @xmath63 to uniformly spaced times .",
    "this assumption is clearly not valid for our waveforms ( see fig . 1 of the paper ) .",
    "we therefore used the lomb periodogram described in @xcite , which is designed to handle nonuniform data . as is common for real signals",
    "@xcite , we define the psd over positive frequencies only and normalize so that its integral over these frequencies gives the variance of the waveform . with this definition ,",
    "the psd at each value of @xmath0 is twice as large as for the two - sided spectrum often used in theoretical work , and we took this into account when applying the results of blaquiere for the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath48 .",
    "we multiplied @xmath21 by a hann window before computing the psd in order to remove spurious effects due to the non - periodic nature of the data , and the effect of this window was included in the normalization of the psd @xcite .",
    "the output of an oscillator having no phase noise but with an additive noise voltage @xmath64 is@xmath65 at it zero crossings , @xmath23 has a slope of@xmath66 a weak voltage noise @xmath67 will cause a timing noise given approximately by@xmath68 which implies a phase noise@xmath69 the same result is derived in a slightly different way in @xcite ( see equations 30 through 34 ) .",
    "this result implies that the psd of phase noise due to additive voltage noise is@xmath70 we note that eq .",
    "[ eq : sphifloor ] differs by a factor of two from the often - cited result by leeson in @xcite .",
    "the noise in our signal path is nearly independent of the impedance seen by the input of the first amplifier for loads less than 50 @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we estimate the minimum @xmath71 presented to the first amplifier as that of a 50 @xmath39 load at 290 k. using the gains and noise temperatures of our amplifiers , we propagate this noise through our 50 @xmath39 signal path in the standard way @xcite and find an ouput noise of @xmath72 . combining this with @xmath73 22 mv gives @xmath74 ( with an uncertainty of about a factor of 2 ) as the noise floor due to johnson noise in our measurement",

    "<S> the psd for the sine wave saturates at @xmath38  rad@xmath37/hz , which is consistent with the noise floor for zero crossings set by the johnson noise of a 50  @xmath39 impedance propagated through the signal path @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation of the sto phase noise at a higher value could be explained by additional white noise on @xmath23 ( before amplification ) of about 2  nv@xmath40hz@xmath41 , a level too small to measure directly in our setup . </S>",
    "<S> the phase added along the signal path varies slightly with frequency , but the noise floor due to this effect is @xmath42  rad@xmath37/hz .    . </S>",

    "<S> phase noise and frequency noise are equivalent ways of expressing the instability of an oscillator @xcite , and because frequency is the derivative of phase , their psds are related by @xmath45 . the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sphifig ] thus imply that @xmath46 is independent of @xmath0 ( below @xmath47  hz ) , suggesting that frequency fluctuations in our vortex mode sto are driven by a white noise source such as thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of @xmath48 for @xmath49  hz is @xmath50  hz@xmath37/hz for the 142.5  mhz mode and @xmath51  hz@xmath37/hz for the 128  mhz mode .        </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath46 allows us to calculate the contribution of phase noise to linewidth as follows @xcite . neglecting amplitude noise , the ensemble - averaged @xmath23 for oscillators whose </S>",

    "<S> the power spectrum of @xmath23 ( the quantity measured by a spectrum analyzer ) has a full - width - at - half - maximum @xmath52 that is proportional to the psd of the white frequency noise : @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath48 is the one - sided psd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus our values of @xmath48 above imply linewidths of @xmath54  mhz for the 142.5  mhz mode and @xmath55  mhz for the 128  mhz mode . using a spectrum analyzer , we measured linewidths of @xmath56  mhz for the 142.5  mhz mode and @xmath57  mhz for the 128  mhz mode . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that phase noise is responsible for about 70 % of the linewidth in both cases , with the rest presumably due to amplitude noise . </S>",
    "<S> ( as mentioned above , sto amplitude noise is masked by amplifier noise in the waveform data presented here . )    a common way to improve the phase noise of an oscillator is to use a phase - locked loop ( pll ) . </S>",
    "<S> although abrupt phase jumps such as those seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ wave+phifig]b can not be removed , a pll can stabilize the sto against slower phase variations such as those in fig . </S>",

    "<S> we built a pll in which @xmath23 from both the sto and a signal generator at the reference frequency are converted into square waves using digital comparators . </S>",
    "<S> timing jitter between these square waves produces an error signal that is fed into an integrator , and the integrated error signal is added to the dc bias current of the sto using a dual - input bias tee . </S>",
    "<S> distortion in the digital comparators becomes excessive above 200 mhz , and the overall feedback bandwidth is limited to 3 mhz by the input of the bias tee .     dependence . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the pll as measured by the spectrum analyzer is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ svfig ] . </S>",
    "<S> the left plot is the spectrum of the 128 mhz mode before locking the pll , as well as a lorentzian fit giving @xmath58  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the right plot is the spectrum with the pll on , showing a large increase in power at the 128  mhz reference frequency . comparing the area of the narrow peak with the total area over a 6  mhz span , we find that 20 % of the power occurs within @xmath59 resolution bandwidth of the reference frequency , for resolution bandwidths as low as 10 hz . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a similar result for the 142.5  mhz mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the pll on @xmath60 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sphipllfig ] , where one can see a modest decrease in noise for frequencies below the 3  mhz limit mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the variance obtained by integrating @xmath60 over @xmath0 is 1.2  rad@xmath37 with the pll off and 0.53  rad@xmath37 with the pll on . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the pll is more dramatic in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ svfig ] than in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sphipllfig ] because the spectrum analyzer spends @xmath61s at each frequency while acquiring the spectrum , whereas the waveforms used to obtain @xmath60 last only 4  @xmath31s . </S>",
    "<S> longer waveforms ( using an oscilloscope with more memory ) should reveal a more significant decrease in @xmath60 at lower frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> the technique described here for directly measuring phase and its power spectral density offers a valuable characterization tool for stos . </S>",
    "<S> it gives information that is not available from a linewidth measurement and it can discriminate among models for noise that predict similar linewidths but different forms for @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> such tests will be useful in understanding the behavior of stos and in pushing their performance toward that required by applications .    </S>",
