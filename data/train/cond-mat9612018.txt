    "the main approach to a statistical description of the spectra in complex quantum systems originates from the pioneering work of wigner @xcite , who conjectured that random matrices could represent the simplest meaningful model for studying heavy nuclei .",
    "currently , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has become a very effective tool in a large variety of physical applications . until recently the matrices in this theory",
    "were assumed to be homogeneous , i.e. all matrix elements were taken to have identical statistics .",
    "this simplification is mainly dictated by mathematical reasons since the corresponding ensembles of random matrices are rotational invariant , a property that simplifies the theoretical analysis .",
    "for a long time , the rmt had no concrete physical basis , in the sense that conditions for its applicability were not specified .",
    "it was believed that the systems under consideration had to be extremely complex in order to have a good agreement with the predictions of the rmt @xcite .",
    "the situation has changed with the progress of the so - called quantum chaos theory which deals with dynamical hamiltonian systems exhibiting chaotic motion in the classical limit .",
    "one of the main results of this theory is that in the extreme case , when classical motion is strongly chaotic and no influence of quantum localization is taken into account , statistical properties of both spectra and eigenfunctions are well described by the rmt .",
    "this statement has been thoroughly studied and confirmed both for autonomous systems like chaotic billiards @xcite and for time - dependent models like the kicked rotator model ( kr ) @xcite and the kicked tops @xcite",
    ". moreover , there are many physical examples where `` complexity '' of a quantum system is not maximal , but nevertheless a statistical description applies pretty well .    to describe the consequences of quantum localization in the presence of strong classical chaos , a new type of random matrices has been introduced when studying the kr @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of these matrices is their band - like structure , which is related to the finite range of interactions in a given basis . in a sense",
    ", the ensembles of band random matrices ( brm ) can be regarded as an extension of the conventional random ensembles , since the latter are recovered by just setting the band size @xmath0 equal to the matrix size @xmath1 .",
    "currently , the interest for brm raised significantly due to their close relationship with quasi-1d models with random potentials @xcite , or 1d systems with long - range hoppings between neighboring sites . in the 1d interpretation",
    ", the band size @xmath0 corresponds to the hopping range while in the quasi-1d case , it is associated with the number of transverse channels for electron wave propagation along a thin wire .",
    "recent numerical and analytical studies of brm ( see @xcite and references therein ) , led to numerous results regarding the structure of eigenstates . in particular , the localization length has been shown to depend only on the scaling parameter @xmath2 , so as the statistical properties of the eigenstates that are directly related to the fluctuation properties of the conductance .",
    "however , much less is known about the evolution of wave packets in models described by brm .",
    "one should note that even in the `` simple '' case of anderson - type models in 1d only the short and the long time scales , corresponding to ballistic spread and saturation of the packet width , respectively , have been successfully studied @xcite . in quasi-1d ( or 1d with long - range hoppings )",
    "models , the picture is both more complicated and more interesting with respect to the anderson case .",
    "indeed , while the diffusion time scale is absent in 1d models of anderson type , since the mean free path is of the order of the localization length , classical diffusion alters the ballistic spread in quasi 1d systems , before being eventually suppressed by localization effects .    in dynamical systems , the influence of strong localization on classical diffusion in momentum ( or energy )",
    "space has been studied in detail in the framework of the kr .",
    "it was found that the time scale of the wave - packet spreading that is analogous to classical diffusion is much longer than the logarithmic time scale over which the complete correspondence between classical and quantum description holds @xcite . the entire diffusive process , including the final saturation proved to exhibit remarkable scaling properties @xcite . in particular",
    ", the diffusive time scale is proportional to the localization length of those eigenstates which are involved in the dynamics . in view of the analogies existing between dynamical and anderson - type localization",
    ", the results obtained in the study of wave packet evolution in the kr will represent the touchstone for the present investigation of packet dynamics in quasi-1d disordered models .",
    "however , because of the existence of basic differences as well ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not presently clear to what extent the similarity between dynamical and disordered systems can be pushed forward .    in this paper",
    "we extend a previous study @xcite of initially @xmath3-like wave packets in a quasi-1d geometry , with particular attention to their width and fluctuations on different time scales .",
    "we hope that our detailed numerical investigations , providing direct information on the dynamical properties of strong localization , will furnish also some insight for future analytical studies .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the model is introduced and discussed together with the main properties of spectra and eigenstates of brm . in sec .",
    "3 both ballistic and diffusive time scales are analyzed and the scaling properties of packets in terms of the band - width @xmath0 are established .",
    "the effect of noise in the destruction of coherence is also briefly discussed .",
    "section 3 terminates with the results for the suppression of classical diffusion due to the localization of eigenstates . in section 4 ,",
    "we focus on the problem of fluctuations of the shape of packets both for the diffusive and relaxation time scales . in section 5 ,",
    "a phenomenological description of the asymptotic shape of the packets is given , based on results for the 1d anderson model .",
    "moreover , fluctuations along the asymptotic profile of packets are studied .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "since its birth , random matrix theory has been mainly dealing with statistical properties of `` full '' random matrices , for which all off - diagonal matrix elements are independent and distributed according to the same law . in physical applications",
    "this implies that interactions are assumed to be so strong and complex that no other parameter , apart from the symmetry of matrices , is to be taken into account . as a result ,",
    "such matrices are associated with the extreme case of maximal chaos which is known to appear in various physical systems such as heavy nuclei , atoms , metallic clusters , etc .",
    "furthermore , full random matrices represent a good model for the description of local statistical properties of spectra and eigenstates in some range of the energy spectrum , typically , in the semiclassical region .    on the other hand ,",
    "the conventional rmt is both unable to describe important phenomena such as localization of eigenstates , and to characterize the spectra of physical systems influenced by strong localization effects .",
    "for this reason , much attention has been recently paid to the so - called band random matrices which are characterized by the free parameter @xmath0 defining the effective band width of a hamiltonian .",
    "such random matrices with elements decaying away from the main diagonal , appear to provide more realistic models for the hamiltonian of `` complex '' quantum systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest type of brm is given by matrices @xmath4 with zero elements outside the band ( @xmath5 , while inside the band ( @xmath6 ) , matrix elements are assumed to be independent and distributed according to a gaussian law , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath9 implying that the variance of the off - diagonal matrix elements is equal to 1 .",
    "the brm ensemble can be regarded as a generalization of the standard gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) as the former reduces to the latter when @xmath10 .",
    "analogous generalizations can be introduced for the unitary and symplectic ensembles of band random matrices @xcite .",
    "the limit case @xmath11 corresponds to diagonal matrices , while @xmath12 corresponds to tridiagonal hamiltonians with both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .",
    "the latter case is well known in the physics of disordered media ; the main properties of such matrices are relatively well understood .",
    "the general case of brm where the variance of the matrix elements decreases with the distance from the main diagonal , introduced in @xcite , is also amenable to an analytic treatment .",
    "they are not , strictly speaking band matrices , but an effective band size @xmath0 can be defined from the shape of the envelope@xcite .    in what follows , we consider large values of @xmath13 and assume that @xmath14 .",
    "the first condition implies a large number of nearby states coupled by the interaction .",
    "the second condition allows to neglect finite size corrections arising from the finiteness of the samples .",
    "considerable interest towards the ensemble of brm was stimulated by the investigation of the quantum behavior of periodically driven hamiltonian systems .",
    "a paradigmatic system in this class is the so - called kicked rotator model .",
    "indeed , the unitary matrix @xmath15 yielding the time evolution between two consecutive kicks has , in the angular momentum representation , a band - like structure with an effective band - size approximately equal to the strength @xmath16 of the kicks . outside the band ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath15 decrease extremely fast , while inside the band they can be treated as pseudo - random entries if the corresponding classical evolution is chaotic@xcite . as a consequence , both spectra and eigenstates of brm of the type ( [ brm ] )",
    "are expected to have statistical properties similar to those of the kr .",
    "a number of data substantiate this belief @xcite .",
    "brm play also an important role in the understanding of quasi-1d disordered media .",
    "the connection has been established through the nonlinear sigma model which , on the one hand , is known to provide an excellent description of quasi-1d systems and , on the other , has been rigorously shown to be reducible to the brm model @xcite .",
    "such relationships gave a boost to the investigations of statistical properties of eigenstates and eigenvalues of brm as they also allow a better understanding of the properties of the kr , as well as of quasi-1d and 1d models with long - range random interactions .",
    "as was first numerically shown in @xcite and later analytically proved in @xcite , the density of states @xmath17 for infinite brm ( @xmath18 ) obeys the semicircle law @xmath19 with @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is just the standard deviation of the distribution of off - diagonal elements , @xmath23 ; it does not influence the statistical properties of the spectra as well as the structure of the eigenstates , since it can be scaled out . for @xmath10 , expression ( [ dos ] )",
    "reduces to the well known wigner semicircle law derived in conventional rmt .    in infinite brm , all eigenstates @xmath24 are known to be exponentially localized @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the `` center '' of an eigenfunction in the basis in which the random matrices have been defined .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is the localization length defined as the inverse of the asymptotic spatial decay - rate of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "numerically , @xmath28 can be determined by implementing the transfer matrix method .",
    "it is important to recall that the localization length @xmath29 describes the decay of the eigenfunction only in the tail and not in the central region of size @xmath30 .",
    "this region is characterized by an effective number @xmath31 of `` principal components '' which are usually defined in terms of the inverse participation ratio and of the so - called entropic localization length @xmath32 ( see @xcite for details ) .    in finite samples ,",
    "one more parameter comes into play , the rank @xmath1 of the matrices .",
    "in such a case , all relevant properties of spectra and eigenstates are parametrized by the ratio @xmath33 @xcite . upon changing @xmath34",
    ", one can accurately follow the transition from the completely localized @xmath35 to the delocalized @xmath36 regime .",
    "numerous studies of brm allowed to unravel the dependence of the statistical properties of eigenfunctions on this scaling parameter .",
    "in particular , in finite bases of size @xmath1 , all eigenstates are extended if @xmath37 , and all their properties are very similar to those for the standard rmt .",
    "our interest here , is devoted to the opposite limit @xmath38 of very localized eigenstates where finite - size effects can be neglected .",
    "based on the results obtained for the kr @xcite , it was predicted that the localization length @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40",
    ". a rigorous analysis @xcite has confirmed this prediction and established the dependence @xmath41 of the localization length on the energy . in the case of brm with a general envelope function @xmath42 for matrix elements",

    "although considerable progress has been made in the description of the eigenstate structure ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the evolution of wave packets is still poorly understood even in the limit of infinite samples .",
    "the mathematical model we consider below is the time - dependent schrdinger equation on a 1d lattice , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the probability amplitude for an electron to be at site @xmath51 and @xmath4 is a symmetric brm of the type ( [ brm ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ tde ] ) has been integrated numerically using a finite - time - step ( @xmath52 ) fourth order runge - kutta algorithm on a self - expanding lattice in order to eliminate finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "whenever the probability of finding the particle at the edges of the chain exceeded @xmath53 , @xmath54 new sites were added to each edge .",
    "the initial condition was taken to be a @xmath55-like state located in the middle of the chain , i.e. @xmath56 . at each time step",
    ", the normalization condition for the total probability , @xmath57 , was checked observing fluctuations smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "a further check of the accuracy of our calculations has been performed by reversing the time - axis direction after 2000 time units ( for @xmath59 ) .",
    "the difference between the initial probability distribution and that obtained after integrating for 2000 + 2000 units was found to be less than @xmath60 . in all the cases discussed below",
    ", a large number of disorder realizations has been considered ( more than 150 ) in order to get rid of sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "the time - evolution of a quantum wave packet in the lattice is naturally described by the mean square displacement , @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for the average over different realizations of the frozen disorder @xmath4 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath63 provides a qualitative description of the dynamical regime : a power - law evolution , @xmath64 , with @xmath65 corresponds to a sub - diffusive behaviour ( hinting at a possible , eventual localization ) , @xmath66 corresponds to ordinary diffusion , while @xmath67 to super - diffusion ( @xmath68 characterizes ballistic motion ) .",
    "as mentioned above , brm can be regarded as a good model for dynamical quantum systems such as the kr in the region of strong classical chaos . in the classical limit",
    ", this model exhibits an unbounded diffusion in angular momentum space if the kick strength exceeds some critical value .",
    "it was discovered that even in the deep semi - classical domain , quantum effects can suppress classical diffusion @xcite giving rise to a phenomenon that is closely related to anderson localization of a quantum particle in random potentials @xcite .",
    "this effect of `` dynamical localization '' was claimed to be experimentally observed in the ionization of hydrogen subject to a monochromatic field @xcite .",
    "a formal connection with a 1d tight - binding model has been found in @xcite , thus reviving a general interest for localization in one - dimensional systems .",
    "we have investigated the behaviour of @xmath63 by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ tde ] ) for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the results of our analysis have been compared with both theoretical predictions of the 1d anderson model and numerical findings for the kr .",
    "the essential difference between periodic and disordered quantum lattice structures mostly lies in the localization properties of their electronic states . in the periodic case ,",
    "all the states are perfectly extended bloch waves , while in strongly disordered samples , the states are asymptotically localized in time because of quantum interference effects",
    ". however , even in the latter case , there exists a ballistic regime , occurring on time scales of the order of the elastic scattering time @xmath69 , i.e the time for an electron to move by an amount corresponding to the mean free path @xmath70 . in quasi-1d systems , @xmath70 is known to be equal to the number of transverse channels .    in order to investigate the scaling behavior of the packet size with @xmath0",
    ", we have numerically integrated eq .",
    "( [ tde ] ) for very short times @xmath71 and different values of @xmath0 in the range @xmath72 .",
    "the behaviour of the mean - square displacement @xmath63 is reported in fig .  1",
    "with the scaling assumption @xmath73 the very good data collapse confirms the scaling anzatz .",
    "( [ bts ] ) can be understood by estimating the ballistic time scale @xmath69 .",
    "let us start by noticing that the leading contribution to the wavepacket spreading over short time scales comes from the @xmath74 sites which are directly coupled with the site @xmath75 where the wave packet is concentrated at time @xmath76 .",
    "by evaluating the schrdinger equation and thereby determining @xmath63 , one obtains @xmath77 the above type of evolution terminates when the average width @xmath78 of the packet becomes of the same order as the band - size @xmath0 , so that farther sites come into play . by substituting back in eq .",
    "( [ bal4 ] ) , one finds that the ballistic spread occurs on the time scale @xmath79 accordingly , the ballistic time scale shrinks to zero for increasing the interaction range @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the ballistic regime is entirely new with respect to the analogous problem in the kr where , at small times , an exponentially fast spread of the packet takes place .      in 1d anderson - type models ,",
    "wave packet saturation starts immediately beyond the ballistic time scale , since the mean free path @xmath70 and the localization length @xmath39 are of the same order ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "accordingly , no intermediate diffusive regime can be observed . in the case of large band - size , @xmath13 , the localization length @xmath81 is much larger than the mean free path @xmath82 , so that a diffusive time scale @xmath83 appears . in order to estimate @xmath83",
    ", we shall follow the scaling arguments developed from the theory of quantum chaos where they have been successfully introduced to explain the well known `` quantum suppression of classical diffusion '' in the kr @xcite .",
    "the first crucial observation is that the eigenfunctions @xmath24 are exponentially localized in the standard basis for all energy values @xmath48 in the spectrum ( consequently , there is a pure - point spectrum @xmath17 ) .",
    "let us proceed by noticing that an initial state @xmath84 excites an effective , finite number @xmath85 of eigenstates with corresponding energies @xmath86 .",
    "accordingly , the spectrum of those eigenstates participating to the evolution of the packet is characterized by a mean level spacing @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the radius of the semicircle , see eq.([dos ] ) .",
    "therefore , for times @xmath89 , the packet evolution does not `` feel '' the discreteness of the spectrum , which is resolved over longer time scales and eventually leads to localization . a typical evolution",
    "is reported in fig .  2 , where the dependence of the mean square displacement @xmath90 for @xmath91 is shown on a very large time scale .",
    "however , as long as @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the motion of the particle is analogous to the standard ( classical ) diffusion .",
    "this means that @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the diffusion constant and @xmath96 can be interpreted as the square of the number of effectively excited , unperturbed states .",
    "this regime is clearly seen in the inset of fig .  2 , where the evolution of @xmath96 is reported in a doubly logarithmic plot .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 reaches its maximal value @xmath97 at @xmath98 .",
    "the value @xmath99 is of the same order as the total number @xmath85 of eigenstates that participate to the packet evolution .",
    "let us finally notice that the packet - width is asymptotically of the order of the localization length of the eigenfunctions , i.e. @xmath100 ( the energy dependence is here irrelevant and can be dropped ) .",
    "accordingly , the following scaling relations hold @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the width of the spectrum . the second estimate in ( [ tdiff ] ) corresponds to the well known relation between the localization length and the diffusion coefficient in the theory of disordered solids , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the density of states ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "( [ tdiff ] ) seems to suggest that the proper scaling of the time axis is @xmath105 .",
    "however , as we shall see in the next section , there is convincing evidence that best scaling ansatz , in comparison with the direct integration of the schrdinger equation ( [ tde ] ) , is @xmath106 . whether the discrepancy is to be attributed to some weakness of the above arguments or to an improper choice of the time units in the numerical procedure it is not clear ( in fact , everything works perfectly as if we had to refer to dimensionless time units in eq .",
    "( [ tde ] ) normalized to @xmath107 - see eq .",
    "( [ brm ] ) - rather than to the width of the spectrum @xmath102 ) .",
    "one of the most important peculiarities of the time evolution of wave packets in 1d and quasi-1d random potentials is the saturation of the width @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "in analogy with the evolution of wave packets in the kr @xcite and from the localization properties of the stationary problem ( the localization length grows as @xmath40 ) , one expects that for @xmath110 the limiting value @xmath111 grows as @xmath112 . in order to confirm this prediction ,",
    "we have performed detailed numerical experiments in the range @xmath113 .",
    "the asymptotic value @xmath111 has been accurately determined by averaging @xmath63 over a long time after an initial transient . from our data",
    "we have found that the dependence of @xmath114 on @xmath115 is slightly slower than expected , @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "this anomalous behaviour is presumably to be attributed to the presence of finite band - size corrections which are not negligible in the range of @xmath0 values that has been numerically investigated ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "our results are reported in fig .  3 , where @xmath63 and @xmath119 are divided by the asymptotic value @xmath114 and its square root , respectively .",
    "while the scaling ansatz for @xmath96 follows straightforwardly from the detailed knowledge of the localization properties , the rescaling of time axis is mainly justified a posteriori from the resulting good data collapse that can be observed in fig .",
    "3 .    anyway",
    ", the nontrivial evolution during the late stages of the diffusive regime confirmed by a direct investigation . since generic properties of eigenstates in quasi1d models have been found to be similar to those of strictly 1d disordered models @xcite , it is natural to expect that the similarity extends to the dynamics of wave packets as well .",
    "however , even in 1d - geometry , the analytical treatment is very difficult .",
    "analytical results are available only in the two opposite regimes , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "for example , the asymptotic dependence of the mean squared displacement @xmath122 of packets in the long - time limit is given by @xcite , @xmath123 where @xmath70 and @xmath124 are the mean free path and the corresponding time between consecutive back scattering processes .",
    "this estimate is based on the expression for the quantum diffusion coefficient obtained in @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic singularity in ( [ prig ] ) follows from resonant transitions occurring between pairs of the so - called mott states @xcite .",
    "such states have a peculiar structure characterized by two humps lying at a distance much larger than their effective width .",
    "since mott states appear in pairs , the corresponding energies are very close to each other and this results in a resonant tunneling over large distances .",
    "the influence of mott states on electronic properties of disordered 1d models has been studied in @xcite , where the clustering of energy levels was discovered and attributed to these states .",
    "the effect of these states has been included in the study of the long - time behavior of wave packets in the kr @xcite , where an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ prig ] ) has been introduced to describe the evolution of the mean square displacement @xmath125 in the momentum representation , @xmath126 where @xmath95 is the classical diffusion coefficient .",
    "numerical data seems to confirm the expectations ( eq .",
    "( [ cohen ] ) ) , although the presence of very large fluctuations prevent to draw a convincing conclusion . despite the better statistics of our data , the presence of the logarithmic correction can not be definitely assessed in brm too .",
    "another approach to the problem of quantum diffusion in the presence of strong localization has been recently suggested in @xcite ( see further developments in @xcite ) : it is essentially based on a phenomenological diffusion equation for the green function , which takes into account backward scattering . at large times , the relaxation rate is given by @xcite @xmath127 which differs from eq .",
    "( [ cohen ] ) by a further logarithmic factor . at the moment , all available numerical data for the kr do not allow to draw a final conclusion in favor of either expression . in any case",
    ", let us again remark that quantum localization in the kr is of dynamical nature ( there is no randomness in the model ) , so that it is not clear to what extent it is similar to the localization of anderson type .    instead of focussing on the question of the exact asymptotic dependence ( @xmath128 ) of the mean square displacement @xmath63 , it is , for the time being , more useful to limit ourselves to provide an effective description of the wide time region that includes also the crossover from classical diffusion to complete saturation . in the absence of any theory ,",
    "we make use of the phenomenological expression suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath129 where @xmath114 , @xmath83 and @xmath130 are the three independent parameters to be determined .",
    "the first one is obviously obtained from the asymptotic evolution , while the short - time classical diffusion ( here , we neglect the ballistic time scale which is indeed negligible for large @xmath0 ) provides a further constraint to be fulfilled .",
    "in fact , for @xmath131 , eq .  ( [ fit ] ) reduces to @xmath132 which allows expressing @xmath83 in terms of the last unknown @xmath130 which can be determined by fitting the global behaviour of @xmath63 .    the main idea behind the phenomenological expression ( [ fit ] ) is the repulsion of the energy levels participating to the evolution of the packet .",
    "as it was previously discussed , the diffusion rate is proportional to the mean spectral density and it remains unchanged for @xmath133 , according to the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , for @xmath134 it decreases , since the only eigenstates that continue to contribute ( `` operative eigenstates '' ) are those whose energy level - spacing @xmath135 satisfies the relation @xmath136 .",
    "the relative number of such spacings ( hence , the relative diffusion rate ) is given by the spacing distribution @xmath137 for the operative eigenstates , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is assumed .",
    "the above time dependence for large times is the core of the phenomenological expression ( [ fit ] ) ( see details in @xcite ) .    according to the above relation",
    ", the parameter @xmath140 characterizes an effective repulsion between those eigenstates which are excited by the initial wave packet .",
    "it is clear that these eigenstates strongly overlap . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath140 can be expected to be quite close to @xmath141 .",
    "although these arguments are no longer valid for very long times , when the level clustering @xcite due to the influence of mott states becomes important , eq .  ( [ fit ] ) can still provide a sufficiently good description of the packet dynamics .",
    "numerical experiments done for the kr @xcite yield quite a small value of @xmath130 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "this result , which is somehow contradictory with other studies ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , is probably due to the insufficiently long times considered in the simulations .",
    "our detailed numerical experiments with brm , performed on a much longer time scale and with high statistics , reveal quite a good correspondence with the scaling dependence ( [ fit ] ) ( see fig .",
    "the best fit of eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) gives the following values : @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "since the values of the band size @xmath0 are not very large , the limiting value @xmath145 has been purposely rescaled to the same level for the different @xmath115-values . by neglecting the residual weak deviations from a perfect scaling , we obtain @xmath146 .",
    "the most important point of the above analysis is that the value of the repulsion parameter @xmath140 is quite close to @xmath141 .",
    "this means that even for very large times close to the relaxation , the approximate power dependence @xmath147 for the difference @xmath148 mimics the correct dependence @xmath149 ( see eq .",
    "( [ prig ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", one can treat the scaling dependence ( [ fit ] ) as a good description of both classical diffusion and its suppression due to strong localization of eigenstates .",
    "the asymptotic localization of the wave packet is entirely a consequence of the frozen character of the disorder in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , in reality , physical systems are also subjected to time - dependent noise ( this is , for instance , the case of applications to nuclear physics @xcite ) . in the kr ,",
    "the influence of a time - dependent noise was discussed for the first time in @xcite ( see also the detailed investigation in @xcite ) , finding that if the strength of the noise exceeds some critical value , then it destroys coherent effects of quantum localization and pure classical diffusion is recovered .",

    "it is first interesting to notice that the computation of @xmath95 can not be easily performed in practice without the presence of noise .",
    "the reason is that in the absence of a time - dependent noise , corrections to the linear behaviour of @xmath63 arise already at short times , thus preventing an accurate determination of the coefficient of the linear growth .",
    "in other words , coherent effects of quantum localization come into play even on the time scale of classical diffusion and this results in a rather smooth transition from classical diffusion to complete relaxation ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    in order to estimate",
    "the critical value of the noise - strength @xmath150 which destroys completely quantum coherence and leads to pure classical diffusion , one needs to compare the shift of levels induced by the additional noise , with the mean level spacing between operative eigenstates .",
    "since the latter turns out to be proportional to @xmath151 , one can see that if the shift @xmath152 is larger than @xmath151 , localization will be completely destroyed .",

    "one should notice the substantial disagreement with the value of the exponent recently obtained in the kr @xcite , @xmath171 .",
    "this scaling parameter has been conjectured to be related to the mesoscopic fluctuations of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "however , the connection has not been entirely clarified .      the next important issue concerns fluctuations around the so - called steady state distribution of the wave packet in the asymptotic regime @xmath139 .",
    "if one assumes that the steady state distribution of @xmath172 is characterized by an ergodic spread of the packet over some finite size @xmath173 , and if the components @xmath174 are statistically independent , then @xmath175 since the components @xmath174 are directly related to the amplitudes of eigenstates and the latter are expected to be random on the scale of their localization length , one can conclude that @xmath176 , i.e. @xmath177 .",
    "surprisingly , our numerical data in the range @xmath113 indicate that the scaling has a definitely different form , namely @xmath178 with @xmath179 ( see fig .",

    "more precisely , they argued that the asymptotic shape can be described by an ensemble of only @xmath207 statistically independent degrees of freedom ( @xmath173 being the number of `` channels '' where the amplitude of the wavepacket is essentially different from zero ) .",
    "the same conjecture can be raised in the present case as well , although a direct check is an extremely hard task .",
    "as mentioned above , the localization of all eigenfunctions ( see eq .",
    "( [ locle ] ) ) implies that for @xmath139 the quantum steady - state @xmath208 fluctuates around an average profile @xmath209 .",
    "as the effective number of eigenstates composing a single wavepacket is finite , the average profile does depend on the disorder realization .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath210 , the number of statistically independent components diverges and sample - to - sample fluctuations are expected to vanish . in that limit , temporal and ensemble averages should coincide as long as the motion is ergodic .    on the basis of diagrammatic techniques ,",
    "many results have been obtained for the steady state distribution @xmath211 in continuous 1d models with white noise potential ( here , @xmath212 denotes the position of the electron ) .",
    "in particular , an exponential decay @xmath213 has been predicted for the tails of @xmath211 ( @xmath70 , being the mean free path ) @xcite .",
    "a subsequent more accurate analysis @xcite revealed the presence of the prefactor @xmath214 .",
    "both findings are included in the global expression derived in @xcite , @xmath215 while the asymptotic decay is described by @xmath216 therefore , the above two equations reveal that the decay rate @xmath217 ( the prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument ) , changes by a factor 4 .",
    "one consequence of the non purely exponential behavior is that the average size of the saturated packet is two times smaller than the asymptotic localization length @xmath218 ) is similar to that for the conductance of 1d samples of finite size @xcite in the strong localized regime ; in this case @xmath212 is the ratio of the sample size with the localization length .",
    "as no analytical results are available for quasi-1d systems , in the next section we shall compare our numerical results with the above expressions , by fitting the only free parameter @xmath70 .    in any case",
    ", some information on the steady state distribution @xmath219 can be obtained from the structure of the eigenstates by exploiting the following equality , @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the @xmath51-th component of the eigenstate with energy @xmath222 and @xmath26 is the position of the initial @xmath223like packet .",
    "therefore , determining the asymptotic shape of a wave packet is tantamount to determining the average correlation properties of single eigenstates .",
    "although no rigorous results are known in this direction , a phenomenological approach allowed to shed some light on the closely related kr problem @xcite . because of the analogies between brm and the kr , it is instructive to compare the results for the steady distribution as well . a rough estimation of the tails of @xmath219 can be obtained in the following way ( see @xcite for details ) . if one assumes the simple exponential form @xmath224 , for the @xmath225-th eigenstate , eq .",

    "a peculiarity of all our simulations is that @xmath244 is larger than the neighboring values by approximately a factor 3 .",
    "the reason of this apparent anomaly can be traced back to the specific @xmath3-like shape of the initial packet ( that implies eq .",

    "( [ gogolin ] ) ) .",
    "the best fit of the only free parameter gives @xmath249 ; the corresponding curve is shown in fig .",
    "8 ( see the solid line ) .",
    "the very good agreement between the numerical results and the analytical curve over a broad range of @xmath212-values suggests that a properly modified theory to include the determination of the mean free path from first principles should be able to account for the asymptotic properties of packets in quasi-1d systems as well .",
    "one should also notice that the dependence of the slope on the distance from the center @xmath26 of the packet is an entirely new feature with respect to the analogous problem in the kr @xcite , where no evidence of two distinct regions of localization has been found .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is not clear : on the one hand it is possible that this reflects an actual difference between the two models , on the other hand , it is possible that the accuracy of the numerical data for the kr @xcite is not enough to reveal this peculiarity in the associated profile @xmath219 .",
    "a further difference is the variation of the localization length of the eigenstates with the energy in brm ( see eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) ) .",
    "far from the center of the packet , we expect that the decay is dominated by the longest localization length @xmath250 ( in @xmath40 units ) . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) , we find that @xmath251 , which is only slightly smaller than @xmath252 . accordingly , the equality @xmath253 found in the phenomenological theory for kr and explained by invoking the presence of strong fluctuations of the individual eigenstates @xcite appears to hold also in the present case .",
    "the small deviation is presumably to be attributed to the not yet vanishing contributions of more localized eigenstates .",
    "instead , if we average over all energies , we obtain @xmath254 ( in @xmath40 units ) which results to a localization length @xmath255 for the total wavefunction . moreover , it is interesting to notice that a direct determination of @xmath228 by fitting the profiles reported in fig .  8 with a pure exponential law , yields",
    "@xmath256 : this means that the multiplicative correction @xmath257 in expression ( [ asymp ] ) is essential for a correct estimate of @xmath228 , if the range of @xmath258 is not large enough .",
    "a further more direct confirmation of the presence of strong fluctuations in the various eigenstates is obtained by determining the localization length @xmath259 of the asymptotic packet from the logarithmic average @xmath260 of the single packets . the resulting profile , reported in fig .  9 , yields @xmath261 to be compared with the value @xmath262 , obtained from the arithmetic average .",
    "interestingly enough , the ratio between the two lengths @xmath263 and @xmath228 for the shape of saturated wavepacket , is approximately equal to 2 as known for the single eigenstates ( see the previous subsection ) .      in this section",
    "we investigate directly the nature of wave - packet fluctuations in the asymptotic regime .",
    "this enables us to test the correctness of a conjecture relative to the single eigenvectors raised in the context of the kr .",
    "indeed , fluctuations are very important in that they allow explaining the difference between the decay rate of the wave packet and that of the eigenvectors .    having in mind eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) , we computed the logarithm of @xmath219 and studied its variance at a distance @xmath264 from the center of the packet ( averaging also over a small window of 5 neighboring sites , under the assumption that the fluctuations are nearly constant in such interval ) . as a result",
    ", we have found that the distribution function of @xmath265 is , with a good accuracy , a gaussian ( see for instance the histogram reported in fig .",
    "10 which refers to the case @xmath266 and is the result of 5,000 simulations with independent realizations of the disorder ) .",
    "this represents a first confirmation that the hypotheses made in the kr can be profitably carried over to the present model .    a more complete information is obtained by studying the fluctuations of @xmath267 for different values of @xmath268 .",
    "more precisely , we have computed the variance @xmath269 in the steady - state regime .",
    "the results for the cases @xmath270 are reported in fig .  11 with the scaling assumption @xmath271 , where @xmath272 .",
    "the data shows that for large @xmath212 , the variance grows linearly with @xmath212 , indicating that the logarithm of the profile diffuses around the average value .",
    "this is a further confirmation of the validity of a relation of the type ( [ fluct ] ) for the wave packet and it is strengthened by the observation that the estimated slope is approximately equal to 1 in scaled units .    this behaviour is also analogous to what happens in 1d disordered models , where it is assumed that the logarithm of the absolute value of the green function @xmath273 has a gaussian probability distribution with the mean equal to @xmath274 and the variance equal to @xmath275 @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation concerns the central part of the packet ( i.e. , @xmath276 ) , where the variance @xmath277 is almost constant , indicating that the amplitude values are essentially independent of one another ( see also the inset in fig .",
    "accordingly , all numerical findings do confirm the conjectures that have been so far utilized to present all the features of wavepacket diffusion in a coherent manner .",
    "unfortunately , so far there are no analytical results concerning the structure of the eigenstates in the middle of their localization region , even in the well - studied 1d anderson case .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the evolution properties of wavepackets in quasi 1d disordered media described by tight - binding hamiltonians with long - range random interactions .",
    "we have found that the wavepacket : ( i ) first spreads ballistically , over a time scale of the order @xmath278 , which becomes negligible in the limit @xmath210 ; ( ii ) exhibits a diffusive behaviour , for times of the order @xmath279 ; ( iii ) finally , for times larger than @xmath280 , stops spreading remaining asymptotically localized .",
    "the scaling properties of the spread of the packet are different in the ballistic ( see eq .",
    "( [ tbscale ] ) ) and diffusive ( see eq .",
    "( [ tdiff ] ) ) regime . beyond the ballistic regime , we propose the heuristic formula ( [ fit ] ) to effectively describe both the diffusive spreading and the eventual saturation .",
    "the most interesting feature of eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) is the prediction of a power - law convergence of the wavepacket width @xmath96 to its asymptotic value , the deviation going to zero as @xmath281 with @xmath282 .",
    "the parameter @xmath130 accounts for the repulsion between those eigenstates which are effectively excited by the initial wavepacket .",
    "more precisely , the slow convergence of @xmath96 is attributed to effect of mott states , that are expected to give eventually rise to a logarithmic time dependence , that can not be numerically observed .",
    "the `` short '' time diffusive regime has been investigated by computing @xmath283 when a small amount of time - dependent disorder was superimposed to the quenched disorder . as a result we found that the diffusion coefficient in dimensionless units is approximately four times larger than the localization length , after averaging over the energy dependence .",
    "the presence of noise with strength @xmath284 of the order of a critical value @xmath285 , destroys quantum coherence and recovers classical diffusion .",
    "another issue addressed in this paper concerns the fluctuations of the size of the packet over different time scales .",
    "we found that for both diffusive and saturation time scales , the relative amplitude of the fluctuations scales as @xmath286 where @xmath287 .",
    "we confirmed this law by taking the fourier power spectrum @xmath288 of sample to sample fluctuations of @xmath96 .",
    "this result , besides confirming the anomalous scaling behaviour provides evidence for the ergodicity of the evolution .",
    "the study of the fourier power spectrum shows that the tails of @xmath289 have a lorentzian - type form . at small frequencies ,",
    "a weak singular behaviour for @xmath188 has been detected ; this result is in agreement with the power - law convergence of @xmath96 to its asymptotic value .",
    "furthermore , we have been able to extract the cross - over frequency @xmath290 , where deviations from @xmath291 start in @xmath288 .",
    "such a frequency is two orders of magnitude smaller that the mean average separation between the energy levels which participate to the evolution of the wavepacket .",
    "this is a further confirmation of the participation of mott states to the long - time evolution .    for what concerns the asymptotic shape of the wavepackets",
    ", we found that the scaling law ( [ scpro ] ) is well verified already for relatively large @xmath0 values .",
    "moreover , the analytic expression derived in the context of the 1d anderson model ( see eq .",
    "( [ gogolin ] ) ) reproduces pretty well the shape of the average profile , upon fitting a single parameter . a further interesting result of our numerical analysis concerns the difference by a factor 4 between the decay rate of the asymptotic profile around the origin and that along the tails .",
    "moreover , the difference between the localization length estimated from the average of the logarithm of the profile and that obtained from the linear average of the profile confirms the relevance of fluctuations .",
