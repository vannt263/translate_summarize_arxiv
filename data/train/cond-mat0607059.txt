    "the hysteretic penetration of magnetic flux into a superconductor has long been a subject of experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "one phenomenon that has often been observed in flat samples in an increasing perpendicular applied magnetic field is a domelike magnetic - flux - density distribution centered in the middle of the sample , surrounded by a superconducting flux - free zone .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated experimentally and interpreted theoretically in both type - i superconductors@xcite and weak - pinning type - ii superconductors.@xcite in these previous investigations , the flux domes have been explained as arising from an energy barrier of geometric origin at the edge of the sample .",
    "once this barrier is overcome , flux tubes or vortices escape from the edge and are driven to the middle by meissner screening currents , which flow on the sample s surface .",
    "in this paper we consider a type - ii superconducting film without edges and predict that when it is subjected to local magnetic fields produced by current - carrying wires above the sample , vortex and antivortex magnetic - flux domes are produced in the film when the currents in the wires are sufficiently large . when bulk pinning is weak , we predict that the vortex and antivortex domes are separated from each other , but as the bulk pinning increases , the space between the vortex and antivortex domes shrinks to zero .    to investigate these effects in an easily calculable geometry , we consider in sec .",

    "[ sec_meissner ] we discuss the meissner - state response of the film before any penetration of vortices into the film , and in sec .  [ sec_vortices ] we discuss the distributions produced by vortices and antivortices that have penetrated through the film thickness .",
