    "a new variety of type ia supernova ( sn ) embedded in a dense circumstellar ( cs ) envelope has been recognized @xcite .",
    "the generic example is sn  2002ic .",
    "another example is the recently discovered sn  2005gj @xcite .",
    "two other suspected members of this new family are sn 1997cy @xcite and sn 1999e @xcite . although both were discovered long after the explosion ( @xmath1 d ) , their close relation to sn  2002ic according to spectra , line profiles , and light curves ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is clear .",
    "the mass of the cs envelope derived from the luminosity powered by the interaction during @xmath2 days is several @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ccl04 ) .",
    "the origin of these events is a challenging problem because existing evolutionary scenarios for sne  ia do not predict such dense cs envelopes .",
    "although single degenerate binary with supergiant secondary or single star ( sn  1.5 ) progenitor scenarios are conceivable @xcite , both face the serious problem of synchronization between the phase of the rapid loss of a massive hydrogen envelope and the explosion @xcite . a binary scenario proposed by @xcite suggests that a main sequence secondary experiences a roche lobe overflow at the time when the white dwarf companion has attained the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "an understanding of the properties of the cs envelope might elucidate the issue . specifically , a strong deviation from spherical symmetry would support the binary over the single star scenario .",
    "the detection of the intrinsic polarization of sn  2002ic at the level of @xmath4% @xcite indicates asymmetry .",
    "wang et al .",
    "conjectured that the cs medium around this supernova is strongly aspherical and makes up a dense equatorial disk with an opening angle of the order of a few degrees .",
    "such structure , if confirmed , would have important implications for the evolutionary scenario .",
    "however , the spherical model is consistent with the observed line profiles and quasi - continuum of sn  2002ic ( ccl04 ) .",
    "moreover , all three supernovae with available spectra ( sn  2002ic , sn 1997cy , sn 1999e ) show similar shapes and widths of spectral lines at similar epochs , which would not be expected in the case of a strongly aspherical interaction ( ccl04 ) .    these issues show the need to develop a model for the polarization of sn  2002ic .",
    "this paper aims to answer the questions : ( 1 ) what is the minimal degree of asphericity implied by the polarization data , and ( 2 ) is the minimal asphericity consistent with the spherical appearance suggested by the spectroscopic arguments ?",
    "our study is based on the spherical model of sn  2002ic proposed earlier for the light curve and spectrum of sn  2002ic ( ccl04 ) , modified here by introducing asphericity of the cs envelope .",
    "the polarization is calculated for a number of aspherical cases using the monte carlo technique .",
    "the results of polarization modelling are discussed along with the modelling of h@xmath5 profiles in the context of comparison with available observational constraints .",
    "we share the view of @xcite that the polarization of sn  2002ic is caused by thomson scattering of photons in an aspherical cs envelope .",
    "a possible contribution of the asphericity of the initial sn ejecta is neglected , given the fact that the polarization of most sne  ia is weak ( @xmath6% ) , except for possibly the outermost layers @xcite which contain a dynamically unimportant mass of the ejecta .    given the difficulty of self - consistent modelling of the hydrodynamics and the optical light for the case of the interaction of a sn  ia with an aspherical cs envelope , we follow a simplified approach .",
    "we rely on the model of sn  2002ic interaction with a spherical cs envelope computed in the thin shell approximation ( ccl04 ) .",
    "the model has a flat cs density distribution at @xmath7 cm , a power law drop @xmath8 for @xmath9 cm , and a steep decay @xmath10 at @xmath11 cm .",
    "the total mass of the cs envelope in the spherical model is @xmath12 .",
    "the radius of the thin shell at the epoch of the polarization observations ( @xmath13 d ) is @xmath14 cm .",
    "we modify the spherical model by assuming that the cs envelope is aspherical and the isodensity surfaces are oblate spheroids with an aspect ratio @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the major and minor semi - axes ) .",
    "the interaction zone , including the forward shock , reverse shock and cool dense shell ( cds ) acquires , on the contrary , the shape of a prolate spheroid with the long axis along the polar axis ( fig .",
    "1 ) . below",
    "we omit a thin layer of hot gas in the reverse shock that contributes neither to the optical radiation nor to the thomson scattering .",
    "the cds formed by the shocked ejecta is responsible for the optical radiation except for the h@xmath5 line ( ccl04 ) .",
    "the layer between the cds of radius @xmath18 and the forward shock of radius @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) contains the shocked cs gas , which is assumed to be homogeneously distributed with radius , but with the dependence on the polar angle @xmath21 obtained from the column density of the swept - up cs gas .",
    "the cs density distribution along the minor axis is assumed to be the same as in the spherical model . given the spheroidal shape of isodensity surfaces , the total mass of the cs envelope exceeds that of the spherical model by a factor @xmath22 .",
    "ccl04 argued that the cds may be fragmented and mixed with the forward shock gas .",
    "we considered two extreme cases : an unmixed case in which the cds is unmixed and all the photons are emitted at the radius @xmath18 , and a mixed case in which the emitting cds material is homogeneously mixed in the forward shock region , @xmath20 , and did not find a noticeable difference in polarization between these cases . here",
    "we present results only for the unmixed case .",
    "the shape of the cds is approximated by a prolate spheroid with the angular dependence of the radius , @xmath23 , where the asphericity parameter is related to the polar and equatorial radii of the cds , @xmath24 . to estimate the polar radius @xmath25 and velocity @xmath26 of the cds along with the corresponding equatorial values , @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    ", we used the spherical dynamical model ( ccl04 ) computed for the cs medium along the polar and equatorial density distributions , respectively , assuming radial flow .",
    "the radial assumption is reasonable for moderate values of the asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we found the shape and velocity asphericity parameters to be @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 on day 244 .",
    "the case @xmath32 gives @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the emissivity depends more strongly on the polar angle than the shape and velocity .",
    "the ratio of the equatorial to polar bolometric fluxes for @xmath31 found from the thin shell approximation model is @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 . for @xmath32 , the model gives @xmath37 .",
    "the expansion velocity of the cds is larger at the pole , while the x - ray emissivity is larger at the equator where the column emission measure is larger .",
    "the variation of the x - ray flux with polar angle can be approximated by the expression @xmath38 .",
    "the same expression is used for the emissivity .",
    "the photons emitted by the cds experience thomson scattering with electrons in the ( i ) ionized unshocked cs gas with a h abundance of @xmath39 ; ( ii ) shocked cs gas in the forward shock ; and ( iii ) unshocked sn ejecta .",
    "the luminosity of the narrow h@xmath5 emission line on day 272 ( assuming an explosion on jd 2452585 ) according to @xcite is @xmath40 erg s@xmath41 .",
    "a simple estimate based on the recombination mechanism shows that the cs gas must be fully ionized to reproduce the required luminosity .",
    "the ionization is presumably maintained by the absorption of the hard x - ray emission from the forward shock with a luminosity of @xmath42 erg s@xmath41 and temperature of @xmath43 kev ( ccl04 ) .",
    "given the uncertainty of the emission measure related to the possible clumpiness we consider two cases : complete ionization ( ionization fraction @xmath44 ) and partial ionization ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "in addition to the hot gas , the postshock gas in the forward shock presumably also contains a cool ( @xmath46 k ) component responsible for the broad h@xmath5 emission line ( ccl04 ) .",
    "pressure equilibrium with the ambient postshock gas for the typical average preshock density of the cs gas of @xmath47 @xmath48 and a forward shock velocity of @xmath49 km s@xmath41 ( ccl04 ) implies a density for the cool gas of @xmath50 @xmath48 at the relevant epoch .",
    "assuming that half the swept - up cs gas ( @xmath51 ) is in the form of the dense shocked cool gas we find that the recombination h@xmath5 luminosity at the time in question , @xmath52 erg s@xmath41 ( cf .",
    "* ) requires an ionization fraction @xmath53 .",
    "we approximately take into account the presence of the h@xmath5-emitting gas in the forward shock by assuming that half the swept - up cs gas in the forward shock is neutral .",
    "the determination of the ionization of the unshocked sn ejecta requires a more complicated model .",
    "we calculated the ionization balance in the sn ejecta in the x - ray radiation field from the reverse shock predicted by the spherical model ( ccl04 ) , assuming that all the absorbed energy is spent on ionization .",
    "the ejecta are assumed to consist of pure iron .",
    "calculations with radiative and dielectronic recombination rates taken from @xcite result in almost the same ejecta ionization on day 244 for the electron temperatures @xmath54 k and @xmath55 k. the ionization stage increases monotonically from fe@xmath56 in the center to fe@xmath57 in the outer layer of ejecta .",
    "the uncertainty of the ionization model does not markedly affect the resulting polarization .",
    "in the extreme case of complete ionization of the ejecta , the polarization is larger by only a factor of 1.3 compared to the preferred case of the ejecta ionization computed for @xmath54 k. a typical value of the thomson optical depth for the sn ejecta at the relevant epoch is @xmath58 , while for the cs envelope together with the forward shock @xmath59 .",
    "the monte carlo technique is used to treat the transfer of polarized radiation emitted by the cds .",
    "the algorithm is similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "two vectors are tracked : the electric field and the photon wave vector .",
    "the direction of the scattered photon is chosen according to the dipole law of scattering .",
    "stokes components @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the escaping photons are summed with the corresponding array elements for a certain inclination angle @xmath62 .",
    "light - travel time effects are neglected , which does not introduce a significant error .",
    "the code was tested using available numerical and semi - analytical results , including the classical chandrasekhar - sobolev solution for a thomson scattering atmosphere .",
    "the calculated polarization of sn  2002ic on day 244 as a function of @xmath63 for the aspect ratios @xmath31 and 0.65 assuming complete ionization ( @xmath44 ) of the cs envelope is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the escaping radiation is polarized along the small axis .",
    "the lower panel shows the effect of lower ionization ( @xmath45 vs. @xmath44 ) for @xmath32 .",
    "the plot also gives the reported average polarization of sn  2002ic with the r.m.s .",
    "deviation @xcite .",
    "for complete ionization both aspect ratios are consistent within errors with the detected polarization in a range of inclination angles @xmath64 ; the case of @xmath31 demonstrates the minimum asphericity compatible with the observations . in the case of partial ionization ( @xmath45 )",
    "the required asphericity should be somewhat larger , @xmath65 .",
    "for @xmath31 the mass of the cs envelope is @xmath66 , i.e. , a factor of two greater than found in the spherical case ( ccl04 ) .",
    "using the spheroidal model of the cs envelope and cds radius according to the spherical model ( ccl04 ) we computed the polarization at the earlier epochs ( 100 , 150 , and 200 days ) for the case @xmath31 and @xmath44 in the same way as for @xmath67 d. the early polarization is larger ( fig .",
    "3 ) owing to more efficient scattering in the envelope with larger optical depth .",
    "such behavior is characteristic of the optically thin regime .",
    "to summarize , the observed polarization of sn  2002ic can be reproduced in a model of a spheroidal cs envelope with the density predicted by the spherical interaction model ( ccl04 ) ; the minimum required aspect ratio is moderate , @xmath68 .",
    "we now address the issue of whether the minimum asphericity found from the polarization modelling is consistent with the assumption that it is common for sn  2002ic - like supernovae and with the fact that the known supernovae ( 2000ic , 1997cy and 1999e ) do not reveal significant variations of the spectral line profile width and shape for both h@xmath5 and caii 8600   at an age of @xmath69 d ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we concentrate on the strong and well delineated h@xmath5 line . with spectral resolution of @xmath70",
    "km s@xmath41 the h@xmath5 profile on day 240 is concave - shaped ( cf .",
    "* ) , or , more specifically , the full width at half maximum @xmath71 km s@xmath41 is significantly smaller than the blue ( or red ) width at zero intensity ( bwzi or rwzi ) , which is @xmath72 km s@xmath41 .",
    "this type of profile is in apparent contrast with that of other cs interaction supernovae , e.g. , sn  1987f with a parabolic line h@xmath5 @xcite or sn  1993j with a boxy h@xmath5 line @xcite  in both cases the fwhm exceeds the bwzi . the high resolution spectrum of sn  2002ic reveals on top of h@xmath5 a narrow p cygni line originating from the cs envelope with a velocity of @xmath73 km s@xmath41 @xcite . here we do not consider the cs component ; it is composed of at least two velocity components : narrow emission with fwhm=78 km s@xmath41 and absorption with the blue wing velocity of @xmath74 km s@xmath41 .",
    "the interpretation of the cs h@xmath5 profile is not obvious and requires a separate study .",
    "we follow the conjecture that broad h@xmath5 is emitted by shocked cs clouds in the forward shock ( ccl04 ) .",
    "the qualitative model suggests that cs clouds are crushed by slow radiative cloud shocks ; the shocked clouds are then dispersed by the kelvin - helmholtz instability into a multitude of fragments that are accelerated by the fast forward shock flow .",
    "this sequence is similar to that found in two - dimensional modelling of blast wave interaction with an interstellar cloud ( klein et al .",
    "1994 ) . as a result of the interaction of the forward shock with a cloudy cs envelope , a broad velocity spectrum ( @xmath75 ) of the line - emitting dense cool gas presumably forms in the forward shock @xcite .",
    "the minimum velocity corresponds to undisturbed cs clouds , while the highest velocity @xmath76 corresponds to the velocity of fragments accelerated up to the velocity of the swept - up shell @xmath77 km s@xmath41 .",
    "we adopt here a simple parametrization of the velocity spectrum of the line - emitting gas @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 , with the maximum at @xmath82 that presumably corresponds to the typical velocity of cloud shocks .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in the case of a spheroidal cs envelope ,",
    "@xmath76 depends on the polar angle @xmath85 , where @xmath26 is the cds velocity at the pole . assuming that the line emissivity per unit mass is constant , the resulting profile @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the radial velocity ) is calculated by integration over the transverse velocity @xmath88 using the relation @xmath89 :",
    "@xmath90 we restrict ourselves to a qualitative description of the broad h@xmath5 .",
    "for the moderately aspherical model consistent with the polarization data ( @xmath32 , @xmath37 , @xmath34 , @xmath91 km s@xmath41 ) we find that the h@xmath5 fwhm and profile shape in sn  2002ic on day 244 @xcite are basically reproduced if @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the model profiles in this case",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( upper panel ) for the inclinations @xmath62 equal to @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the profiles for @xmath97 and @xmath95 are almost identical , while in the pole - on case ( @xmath98 ) the fwhm is a factor of 1.33 smaller than for @xmath97 .",
    "interestingly , although the velocity is largest at the poles , the profile is broader when the sn is viewed in the equatorial plane .",
    "this effect is due to the higher emissivity at the equator .",
    "the implication is that for a spheroidal cs envelope in a sample of sn  2002ic - like supernovae , the polarization should correlate with the h@xmath5 width .    to assess whether the variation of fwhm values with the inclination in the sn  2002ic model for the moderate asphericity is compatible with the range of h@xmath5 width among three sn  2002ic - like supernovae , we note that the maximum fwhm is shown by sn  1999e with fwhm@xmath99 km s@xmath41 @xcite , while the lowest width h@xmath5 is in sn  2002ic with fwhm@xmath100 km s@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of widths is @xmath101 , comparable to the maximum ratio 1.33 predicted by the model of spheroidal cs envelope with @xmath32 .",
    "given only three known events , one may conclude in a preliminary way that the hypothesis of cs envelopes with moderate asphericity ( @xmath102 ) is consistent with both the small variation of the h@xmath5 line profiles and the polarization revealed by sn  2002ic .",
    "unfortunately , our interaction model is not applicable to strongly flattened cs envelopes , so we are not able to explore confidently the h@xmath5 profile behavior in such cases .",
    "just to get an idea about the trend , we consider a cs envelope with an aspect ratio @xmath103 .",
    "for this case the derived asphericity parameters for the velocity and emissivity are @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively . assuming that the line - emitting gas has the same velocity distribution as in the model with @xmath102 , we obtain the line profiles for the same inclinations shown in fig .",
    "4 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the resulting profiles differ in two respects compared to those for @xmath32 : ( 1 ) they have lower fwhm by a factor of @xmath106 ; ( 2 ) their broad wings for large inclinations get weaker and completely disappear for @xmath97 .",
    "the discovery of sn  2002ic - like supernovae with a `` typical '' luminosity but lower than `` normal '' fwhm of h@xmath5 and strongly suppressed broad wings at an age of @xmath107 days would thus indicate interaction with a strongly flattened cs envelope and a line of sight close to the equatorial plane .",
    "such an event should be accompanied by an unusually large intrinsic polarization .",
    "alternatively , the absence of such events in a sufficiently large sample of sn  2002ic - like supernovae would be evidence against the strong asymmetry of the cs envelopes .",
    "the primary goal of this paper was to find the minimum asphericity of the cs envelope around sn  2002ic compatible with the polarization data .",
    "it is demonstrated that a spheroidal cs envelope with a moderate aspect ratio @xmath108 and density and length scale parameters of a previous spherical model ( ccl04 ) is consistent with the observed polarization for a wide range of inclination angles @xmath64 .",
    "we also found that if all sn  2002ic - like supernovae are similar and have cs envelopes with a similar asymmetry ( @xmath109 ) , then the expected variation of the h@xmath5 width due to random inclination is moderate and does not contradict the small variation of the observed h@xmath5 widths .",
    "this resolves the apparent disparity between the asphericity of the cs envelope implied by the polarization @xcite and the high degree of symmetry implied by the similarity of line profiles for sn  2002ic - like supernovae ( ccl04 ) .",
    "yet we stress that our analysis and existing observational data do not completely rule out the possibility that the cs envelopes around sn  2002ic - like events are significantly flattened .",
    "the conclusion that the asphericity of sn  2002ic - like supernovae may be modest does not resolve , however , another important issue : whether asphericity of the cs envelope is a generic property of the cs envelopes around these supernovae .",
    "there are at least two possibilities : ( 1 ) a single star ( @xmath110 ) scenario holds and the asphericity of the cs envelope around sn  2002ic is a phenomenon perhaps related to the presence of a second star in a wide binary system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility that a single star might retain enough angular momentum in the envelope to produce significant asymmetry of the outflow is also conceivable but seems to be unlikely ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "( 2 ) a close binary scenario holds and the asphericity is a generic property of sn  2002ic - like supernovae .    the issue could be resolved through polarization observations of sn  2002ic - like supernovae .",
    "the single star option predicts that the probability distribution function of polarization ( @xmath111 ) of sn  2002ic - like supernovae peaks at @xmath112 with a weak tail up to @xmath113% populated by rare cases of wide binaries . for the second option",
    ", the distribution function is determined by random inclinations of aspherical cs envelopes with a uniform distribution of @xmath114 : @xmath115 . the @xmath116 dependence in fig . 2",
    "is approximately described by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , given @xmath119 , the expected distribution in the binary scenario , @xmath120 , should be peaked at the maximum polarization with a value @xmath121% .",
    "the weak dependence of the polarization on the age in the range of @xmath122 d ( fig .",
    "3 ) implies that the uncertainty of the phase of the polarization observation by @xmath123 days is not critical for determining the polarization distribution function @xmath111 .    the polarization data for a growing number of these supernovae",
    "thus may become a useful test for both scenarios . in this",
    "regard , polarization measurements of the recent sn  2005gj , as well as other newly discovered sn  2002ic - like supernovae , at an age @xmath124 days are highly desirable .",
