    "it is well known that low and intermediate mass stars ( up to @xmath2 ) evolve leading to the formation of white dwarf ( hereafter wd ) stars .",
    "depending on their masses , wds are expected to have different internal compositions .",
    "for example , low mass wds should have a helium rich interior because they have not reached central temperatures high enough for the onset of helium burning ( t  @xmath3  k ) .",
    "these objects have masses up to @xmath4 and are usually referred to as helium wds ( hereafter he  wds ) . more massive wd ( @xmath5 ) are remnant of higher mass stars that underwent nuclear activity up to helium burning .",
    "consequently , the interior of these wds is expected to be made up of a mixture of carbon and oxygen with traces of neon .",
    "finally , the most massive wds ( @xmath6 ) are expected to have suffered nuclear activity beyond helium burning , leading to the formation of an oxygen and magnesium rich interior . for a detailed discussion of the evolutionary processes leading to the formation of wds",
    "see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in he  wds .    from a physical point of view @xcite , wds are remarkably simple objects .",
    "their structure is supported against gravitational collapse by a fermi gas of strongly degenerate electrons . due to the high efficiency of degenerate material to conduct heat , cool wds have nearly isothermal interiors .",
    "they evolve along an almost straight track in the hertzsprung  -  russell ( luminosity vs. effective temperature ) diagram . because of its simplicity",
    ", many researchers studied the cooling of wds with the aim of employing evolutionary calculations to measure , e.g. , the age of the disk of our galaxy @xcite . with the availability of very deep observations , thanks to the hubble space telescope , it has been possible to study the wd population of globular clusters making wd evolution an important ingredient for the understanding of the evolution of all the stars in such clusters .",
    "these studies called for an increasing degree of sophistication in the modeling of wd cooling .",
    "it was recognized the relevance of element diffusion that modified the chemical composition of the outermost layers of the wd @xcite .",
    "this process is largely a consequence of the strong gravitational field of wd interiors ; it modifies the composition and the opacity of the partially  -  degenerated outermost layers affecting its cooling .",
    "another important effect is crystallization @xcite .",
    "it is expected that coulomb interactions inside carbon  -  oxygen wds should be strong enough for forcing crystallization .",
    "this process should lead to a latent energy release that should be large enough to _ lengthen _ wd cooling significantly .",
    "if a carbon  -  oxygen wd is massive enough it is expected to undergo crystallization at observable luminosity .",
    "obviously , for the case of wds made up of elements heavier than carbon and/or oxygen , crystallization should set in even earlier .",
    "quite contrarily , for the case of he  wds , the standard theory does not predict the occurrence of crystallization at luminosities reachable in real objects at the present age of the universe .    he  wds should arise as a consequence of binary evolution @xcite .",
    "a single star would need a time interval far in excess of the age of the universe to evolve to such a state .",
    "binary systems of close enough components lead to a mass exchange process in which the donor star , originally an intermediate mass object , losses most of its mass . depending on the initial orbital separation and the masses of the components , it may lead to the formation of he  wds on short times @xcite .",
    "he  wds are expected to be the companions of some of the best observed binary systems containing a millisecond pulsar as are the cases of psr  j0437 - 4715 @xcite , psr  j1713 + 0747 @xcite , psr  b1855 + 09 @xcite , psr  j1909 - 3744 @xcite . very recently",
    "@xcite , a population of he  wds has been detected in the globular cluster ngc  6397 . while most of the population of wds is compatible with a carbon  -  oxygen rich interior , they found 24 serious candidates to be he  wds .",
    "usually , the equation of state ( eos ) of the he  wd is modeled as a degenerate fermi gas of electrons with a free , uncondensed gas of he nuclei corrected by non  -  ideal effects ( coulomb , thomas  -  fermi , exchange , etc . ) .",
    "this is described in the appendix of ref .",
    "very recently , the possible occurrence of bec in the deep interior of he  wds has been studied .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the ionic contribution to the specific heat of the condensate would be suppressed and that this would have observable consequences .",
    "also the possibility that he  wds would cool faster has been studied @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "the reason for this to be expected is very simple : at the interior of he  wds , helium nuclei are light and close enough that their associated wave function can overlap that of neighboring nuclei .",
    "consequently , the behavior of the gas of helium nuclei may depart from classical behavior allowing for the occurrence of quantum effects .",
    "let us define the range of densities and temperatures expected to occur at he  wd interiors .",
    "these are dependent upon the mass of the object , however an absolute upper limit for the temperature @xmath7 is imposed by the conditions for helium burning : @xmath7 must be lower than @xmath8  k ( @xmath9  kev ) . regarding the range of values for the density , for a given stellar mass value ,",
    "the upper limit is given by the central density of a zero temperature model as done by hamada & salpeter @xcite .",
    "these values are given in table  [ wdhe_hamsal ] .",
    "it is important to remark that nature does not provide a way to get higher densities with a helium - dominated composition avoiding helium burning .",
    "this is supported by extensive numerical experiments performed by iben & tutukov  @xcite who studied the evolution of close binary systems with components of intermediate masses .",
    "they found that the largest mass of he  wds is @xmath100.50  @xmath11 .",
    ".[wdhe_hamsal ] hamada - salpeter sequence for zero temperature helium white dwarfs . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the stellar and radius , both in solar units , @xmath14 is the central density , @xmath15 is the central particle number density , and @xmath16 is the critical temperature for the center of the star , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcrit ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing the results presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] with the data presented in table  [ table : observations ] we find that the he  wds population in ngc  6397 did not undergo bec yet : their masses are too low and are too bright .",
    "thus , unfortunately , ngc  6397 does not provide an adequate laboratory to look for signals of the charged condensate .",
