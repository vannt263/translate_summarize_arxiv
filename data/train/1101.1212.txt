    "finding the ground - state ( gs ) of an antiferromagnetic _ quantum _ spin model is a notoriously difficult problem .",

    "classical _ spin models at zero temperature can be non - trivial to solve , unless one carries some extensive numerical investigation .",
    "in particular there is no general method to determine the lowest energy configurations for a simple heisenberg @xmath0 model of the type @xmath6 if the lattice sites @xmath7 do _ not _ form a bravais lattice .",
    "it is only if there is a single site per unit cell ( bravais lattice ) that one can easily construct some gs@xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : espiral ] ) .",
    "another situation where the classical energy minimization is not simple is that of multiple - spin interactions , where the energy is not quadratic in the spin components . finding the gs in presence of interactions of the type @xmath8 can be difficult and , in general , has to be done numerically even on simple lattices with a single site per unit cell .",
    "such terms arise in the classical limit of ring - exchange interactions .",
    "for instance , the  apparently simple  classical model with heisenberg interactions competing with four - spin ring - exchange on the triangular lattice is not completely solved.@xcite    in this study , we introduce and construct a family of spin configurations , dubbed `` regular states '' .",
    "these configurations are those which respect all the symmetries of a given lattice _ modulo global spin transformations _ ( rotations and/or spin flips )",
    ". this property is obeyed by most usual nel states .",
    "for instance , a two- ( resp .",
    "three- ) sublattice nel state on the square ( resp .",
    "triangular ) lattice respects the lattice symmetries provided each symmetry operation is `` compensated '' by the appropriate global spin rotation of angle @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath11 ) .    by definition ,",
    "the set of regular states only depends on the symmetries of the model  the lattice symmetries and the spin symmetries  and therefore does not depend on the strength of the different interactions ( @xmath12 in the example of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) ) .",
    "these states comprise the well - known structures , like the two and three sublattice nel states mentioned above , but also some new states , like non - planar structures on the kagome lattice that will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : kag ] .",
    "the reason why these states are interesting for the study of frustrated antiferromagnets is that they are good ",
    "variational candidates  to be the ground - state ( gs ) of many specific models .",
    "in fact , rather surprisingly , we found that these states ( together with spiral states ) exhaust all the gs in a large range of parameters of the frustrated spin models we have investigated . for instance , in the case of an heisenberg model on the kagome lattice ( studied in sec .",
    "[ ssec : j1j2j3 ] ) with competing interactions between first , second and third neighbors , some non - planar spin structures ( based on cuboctahedron ) turn out to be stable phases .",
    "in other words , the set of regular states and spiral states form a good starting point to determine the phase diagram of a classical @xmath0 model , without having to resort to lengthy numerical minimizations . )",
    ", one can directly compare the energies they have for a given microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "] in several cases , we even observed that one of the regular states reaches an exact energy lower bound , therefore proving that it is one ( maybe not unique ) gs of the model .",
    "these states may also be used when analyzing experimental data on magnetic compounds where the lattice structure is known , but where the values ( and range ) of the magnetic interactions are not known .",
    "in such a case , the ( equal time ) magnetic correlations  measured by neutron scattering  can directly be compared to those of the regular states .",
    "if these correlations match those of one regular state , this may be used , in turn , to get some information about the couplings . with this application in mind",

    "<S> we consider some classical and frustrated lattice spin models with global @xmath0 spin symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> we introduce a family of variational spin configurations , dubbed `` regular states '' , which respect all the lattice symmetries _ modulo global @xmath0 spin transformations _ ( rotations and/or spin flips ) . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of these states is explicited through a group theoretical approach , and all the regular states on the square , triangular , honeycomb and kagome lattices are listed . </S>",
    "<S> their equal time structure factors and powder - averages are shown for comparison with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> all the well known nel states with 2 or 3 sublattices appear amongst regular states on various lattices , but the regular states also encompass exotic non - planar states with cubic , tetrahedral or cuboctahedral geometry of the @xmath1 order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> whatever the details of the hamiltonian ( with the same symmetry group ) , a large fraction of these regular states are energetically stationary with respect to small deviations of the spins . </S>",
    "<S> in fact these regular states appear as exact ground - states in a very large range of parameter space of the simplest models that we have been looking at . as examples , we display the variational phase diagrams of the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 heisenberg model on all the previous lattices as well as that of the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath5 ring - exchange model on square and triangular lattices . </S>"
