    "ever since the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in the dilute gases of ultracold atoms , the study of degenerate quantum gases has become a subject attracting a lot of experimental and theoretical vigor@xcite . due to the experimental facilities which allow control of various parameters characterizing the system",
    ", it provides an ideal laboratory for the studies of quantum many - body physics . among them",
    ", one line of researches is to study the mixture of quantum gases .",
    "these include the mixture of bosonic and fermionic atoms ( the bose - fermi mixture)@xcite , and the mixture of two different hyperfine states of the same bosonic atoms@xcite or two different kinds of bosonic atoms@xcite ( the bose - bose mixture ) .",
    "the study of the degenerate mixtures of quantum gases at lower dimensions is particularly interest and a lot of theoretical investigations are devoted to it@xcite .",
    "this is because the competition between the inter - species and intra - species interactions and the strong quantum fluctuations in low dimensions may introduce many interesting phenomena such as phase transition , new quantum states , and quantum phase transitions .",
    "the present work is to study the stability of the low - dimensional bose - fermi ( bf ) and bose - bose ( bb ) mixtures with repulsive interactions in the dilute limit . for binary mixtures with mutual repulsions ,",
    "the system may experience a de - mixing transition by varying the strength of the interspecies interactions .",
    "the de - mixing transition or the stability of the one - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) uniform mixture has been analyzed by using either the mean - field theory@xcite or the bosonization@xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory has the well - known problem that it can not treat properly the strong fluctuations in low dimensions .",
    "though there is nothing wrong with the bosonization approach in one dimension , a naive extrapolation of the results obtained by the bosonization to the strong - coupling regime may sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions .",
    "for example , the bosonization approach predicts that the bf mixture will be phase separated in the strong repulsion regime@xcite . in the solvable limit",
    ", however , the bethe - ansatz result indicates that the uniform bf mixture is stable against de - mixing irrespective of the strength of repulsions@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to study this issue from a different approach . for the @xmath0d single - component dilute bose gas",
    ", it has been shown that the low - energy physics in the strong coupling regime can be well - captured by the renormalization - group ( rg ) method starting from a zero - density quantum critical point ( qcp)@xcite . here",
    "we extend this idea to the low - dimensional mixtures with repulsions .",
    "our results should provide a point of view complementary to the bosonization approach in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "d ( @xmath1d ) bb mixture with repulsions .",
    "we have taken @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed line is the mean - field value . in @xmath0d ,",
    "the critical strength @xmath3 at low density for @xmath4 is a linear function of @xmath5 . in @xmath1d ,",
    "the critical strength @xmath6 at extremely low density for @xmath4 is a linear function of @xmath7}$ ] , where @xmath8 . for @xmath9 , both @xmath3 and @xmath6",
    "take a constant value @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 and @xmath6 will approach the mean - field value @xmath12 at large density . in between",
    ", we assume that they are smooth functions . in the su(@xmath1 ) symmetrical limit , @xmath13 . ]    in one dimension , there is an interacting zero - density fixed point which controls the low - energy physics of the @xmath0d uniform mixture in the strongly repulsive limit .",
    "similar to the single - component dilute bose gas , this nontrivial fixed point can be captured by the @xmath14 expansion , where @xmath15 .",
    "for the two - dimensional ( @xmath1d ) mixtures , all couplings are marginally irrelevant in the sense of rg .",
    "thus , we expect that the stability conditions given by the mean - field theory are correct to the leading order .",
    "our main results are as follows : ( i ) we find that the @xmath0d uniform bf mixture in the dilute limit , i.e. the strong - coupling regime , is always stable against de - mixing for any finite strength of repulsive interactions .",
    "this is consistent with bethe - ansatz result in the solvable limit@xcite .",
    "and our analysis extends this result to the region beyond the solvable limit .",
    "( ii ) we derive the stability condition of the @xmath0d uniform bb mixture in the strong - coupling regime ( fig .",
    "[ 1dbbp ] ) , which is different from the bosonization result .",
    "( iii ) in the extremely dilute limit , we find that the interactions for the @xmath1d mixtures are strongly renormalized so that the stability conditions obtained by the mean - field theory are changed considerably . ( iv )",
    "we also calculate the critical temperature for the @xmath1d bf mixture in the extremely dilute limit [ eq .",
    "( [ 2dbfmtc31 ] ) ] to investigate one aspect of the effects arising from the inclusion of fermions .",
    "although the stability of the mixtures with attractions is also an interesting issue@xcite , it is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "this is because the fixed - point structure for attractions is different from the one for repulsions , i.e. the former exhibits a runaway rg flow , and thus our approach can not give definite results .",
    "finally , we notice that a similar rg analysis of the stability of the dilute bb mixture in low dimensions was also carried out in a recent paper@xcite .",
    "the results are different from ours in certain aspects .",
    "we will address the origin of this discrepancy at the end of the paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the detailed analysis that leads to the above conclusions .",
    "[ bfm ] and [ 2bm ] are about the bf and bb mixtures , respectively .",
    "we compare our results with the previous work in the last section .",
    "an appendix about the mean - field treatment of the bf mixture in @xmath16 dimensions is provided for reference .",
    "to study the mixture of bosons and spinless fermions in the dilute limit , we start with the action @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",

    "we shall take @xmath36 to avoid the possible formation of bound states .",
    "we also assume that @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the average range of interactions between atoms , which can be regarded as the short - distance cutoff of the action @xmath40 .",
    "we will see later that this condition amounts to the dilute limit .",
    "the action @xmath40 [ eq . ( [ bfms1 ] ) ] has a qcp at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( the gaussian fixed point ) . in the dilute limit",
    ", this gaussian fixed point may be an appropriate departure point to study the low - energy physics of this system .",
    "to proceed , we shall employ the rg method .",
    "the strategy is as the following .",
    "we first analyze the fixed - point structure of the theory .",
    "then we integrate the rg equations to the scale where the correlation length becomes of @xmath44 in the unit of the cutoff of the resulting renormalized hamiltonain . at this scale",
    "the quantum fluctuations have been taken into account ( within the @xmath14 expansion ) , and thus we may apply the mean - field theory to the renormalized hamiltonian to study the stability of the mean - field solution corresponding to the uniform mixture . in terms of the solutions of rg equations , we may express the stability conditions in terms of the physical quantities .",
    "to proceed , we first make a change of variables : @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 all become dimensionless , where @xmath50 is a quantity carrying the dimension of mass .",
    "then , the action @xmath40 [ eq .

    "we will see later that @xmath50 always appear in the physical quantities in the guise of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , for universal quantities which do not depend on @xmath39 explicitly , the dependence on @xmath50 is completely dropped out .",
    "the determination of the short - distance energy scale @xmath60 relies on the comparison with exact solutions or experimental results .    to perform the rg transformations ,",
    "we decompose the fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 into @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) consists of the fourier components of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) with @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) consists of the fourier components of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) with @xmath68 . here",

    "since @xmath93 , in the dilute limit , the zero - density fixed point will control the low energy physics in one dimension , whereas in two dimensions it is the gaussian fixed point which will govern the low energy physics .",

    "we see that for the mixtures composed of two different hyperfine states of the same boson , i.e. @xmath9 , the critical strength is given by @xmath232 , which is independent of the boson densities , similar to the @xmath0d case . on the other hands , for the mixtures consisting of two different kinds of bosons , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath233 $ ] .",

    "however , the dependence of @xmath234 on the boson densities is much weaker than the @xmath0d case due to the presence of the logarithm .",
    "this is a characteristic of the @xmath1d bose gas .    a schematic phase diagram for the @xmath0d and @xmath1d bb mixtures with repulsions is shown in fig .",

    "we notice that the action @xmath40 [ eq . ( [ 2boses1 ] ) ] possesses an su(@xmath1 ) symmetry when @xmath9 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 . in this su(@xmath1 ) symmetrical limit , @xmath13 , and the phase boundary may coincide with the mean - field prediction .",
    "we employ the rg to study the dilute bf and bb mixtures with repulsive interactions in low dimensions . for the @xmath0d bf mixture ,",
    "we show that the uniform mixture is stable against de - mixing for any finite strength of repulsions .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the prediction obtained from the bethe ansatz when the system can be solved exactly .",
    "the bosonization approach gave a stability condition of the mean - field type at large boson densities ( the weak - coupling regime)@xcite , while at low boson densities ( the strong - coupling regime ) the stability condition becomes @xmath241 .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the exact solution , while in the solvable limit ours is consistent with the bethe - ansatz result .",
    "we believe that this inconsistency arises from the fact that the relations between the luttinger liquid parameters and the short - distance parameters like @xmath28 and @xmath27 are not reliable in the dilute limit where the system goes into the strong - coupling regime .    for the @xmath1d bf mixture with repulsions in the extremely dilute limit , the uniform mixture is also stable irrespective of the interaction strength .",
    "the mean - field result is expected to be valid in the moderate and high density regime .",
    "we also calculate the critical temperature @xmath145 for the sf phase . by comparing with @xmath145 for the single - component dilute bose gas , we find that the inclusion of fermions increases @xmath145 .",
    "that is , the presence of fermions enhances the long range sf ordering .    for the @xmath0d bb mixture",
    ", the low - energy physics is controlled by a fixed point which does not support the uniform mixture .",
    "this observation immediately leads to two consequences : ( i ) first of all , the equilibrium properties of the uniform mixture will not exhibit universal behaviors even in the strong - coupling regime because we can not take the continuum limit .",
    "( ii ) next , the region of the stable uniform mixture with @xmath4 can be very narrow in the dilute limit . for the @xmath1d bb mixture in the extremely dilute limit ,",
    "the region of the stable uniform mixture with @xmath4 is also narrow because the interactions are strongly renormalized in this limit .",
    "the mean - field result can be applied only in the moderate and high density regime .",
    "a recent paper also studied the stability conditions for the low - dimensional dilute bb mixture in terms of the rg approach@xcite .",
    "the main distinction between our results and the ones in ref .",
    "16 lies at the @xmath0d case with @xmath4 , where our predicted value of @xmath3 can be much smaller than @xmath10 in the dilute limit ( our @xmath10 is basically @xmath242 in ref .",
    "16 ) , while in one dimension with @xmath9 and in two dimensions , both are qualitatively consistent with each other .",
    "the discrepancy may be originated from the different criteria of the stability : in ref .",
    "16 , the criterion for the stability is the positive definiteness of the potential term in the action at any scale @xmath243 . in our opinion",
    ", the use of the positive definiteness of the potential term in the action amounts to some kind of mean - field treatment , and such a procedure is meaningful only when the quantum fluctuations have been properly taken into account .",
    "hence , this criterion can be used only at the scale @xmath244 where the correlation length becomes of @xmath44 in the unit of the short - distance cutoff at @xmath244 .",
    "this is the criterion which we employed in this work .",
