    "without an exception , stable nuclei with a neutron number @xmath2=20 or 28 , as well as their neigbouring nuclei , have a spherical intrinsic shape .",
    "heavy neutron - rich nuclei , however , often exhibit deformed characters even around the shell closure .",
    "typical examples include @xmath3 mg @xcite , @xmath4 mg @xcite , and @xmath5s @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is often interpreted as a disappearance of spherical magic shells @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we investigate the excitation structures of such _ deformed _ neutron - rich nuclei within the framework of quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) . for nuclei",
    "far from the @xmath6 stability line , it has been well recognised that both the pairing interaction and the couplings to the continuum spectra play an important role .",
    "the most robust and consistent framework to deal with these effects on the ground state properties is the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method @xcite .",
    "the continuum qrpa framework based on the hfb approximation has also been developed recently @xcite .",
    "a problem with the hfb method , however , is that it can be computationally very demanding .",
    "for this reason , the application of the continuum qrpa on top of the hfb ground state has been limited only to spherical systems so far @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we avoid this difficulty by using the bcs approximation .",
    "this is an approximation to the hfb method , where one takes only time - reversed pairs in the bogoliubov transformation . with this approximation ,",
    "the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels are decoupled completely ( for a density - independent pairing force at least ) both in the ground state and in the qrpa calculations .",
    "notice that the bcs method has been shown a reasonable approximation to the hfb , within the same treatment for the continuum states , even for nuclei close to the neutron drip line @xcite .",
    "another difficulty related to a deformed qrpa calculation is that the configuration space can be quite large . in the past ,",
    "qrpa calculations for a deformed nucleus have been done either with a simple separable interaction @xcite or with a drastic truncation of the configuration space @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a formalism which uses the response function in the coordinate space @xcite , which is most suitable to a zero - range interaction , eliminating these limitations . together with the bcs approximation for the pairing interaction",
    ", we will demonstrate below that a deformed qrpa calculation now becomes feasible within a reasonable computation time .",
    "let us consider a single - particle motion in a deformed mean - field potential , @xmath7 with @xmath8 here , @xmath6 is the deformation parameter . for simplicity , we take into account only the linear order of @xmath6 in the potential . we have also assumed an axial symmetry , where both the parity @xmath9 and the spin projection @xmath10 onto the @xmath11 axis are conserved .    in order to obtain the single - particle levels and corresponding wave functions ,",
    "we solve the coupled - channels equations for both negative and positive energy states @xcite .",
    "this method has an advantage that the correct scattering boundary conditions can be easily implemented for the positive energy solutions , that is important in a full continuum calculation for neutron - rich nuclei . in this paper , for the sake of simplicity , we instead discretize the positive energy spectra within the same framework by putting the nucleus in a large spherical box , as was recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and leave the full continuum treatment as a future work ( see sect .",
    "the coupled - channels method has sometimes a difficulty in finding all solutions in a deformed potential , especially when there are two states close to each other in energy .",
    "one can easily miss a few eigenvalues in a search routine .",
    "we have overcome this difficulty by introducing the generalized wave function node for a multi - channel system , which was originally proposed by johnson @xcite .",
    "we have checked the efficiency of this method by applying it to a spherical system .",
    "we have also computed the nilsson diagram of @xmath12u and have confirmed that all the levels obtained were smoothly connected to the spherical levels .",
    "evidently , the coupled - channels method with the generalized wave function node efficiently works even for heavy nuclei , where there are lots of intruder levels .    using the single - particle levels obtained in this way",
    ", we then solve the bcs gap equation . as we emphasized in the introduction",
    ", we use the bcs approximation rather than the hfb approximation .",
    "the applicability of the bcs approximation for neutron - rich nuclei has been well tested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we particularly use the density - dependent zero - range force for the pairing interaction .",
    "we will specify the parameters in the next section .",
    "the elements of the qrpa matrices have been given in the textbook of rowe @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the quasi - particle energy and @xmath15 is the time reversed state of @xmath16 . in writing down these equations , we have used the identity , @xmath17 , which follows from the property of the time - reversal operator .",
    "notice that the particle - particle matrix elements vanish in the bcs approximation unless @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eqs .",
    "( [ qrpa - a ] ) and ( [ qrpa - b ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the particle - hole contribution is finite only if @xmath20 and @xmath21 due to the bcs phase convention , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the particle - particle and the particle - hole channels are decoupled completely in the bcs approximation , not only in the ground state but also in the qrpa calculations .    retaining only the particle - hole channel",
    ", one can write down the qrpa equations in the following form : @xmath24 here , we have explicitly expressed the matrix elements of the particle - hole interaction in the integral form . using the single - particle wave function @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are defined by @xmath28 respectively . from these equations ,",
    "one obtains the generalised ( q)rpa dispersion relation @xcite , @xmath29\\,t({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ' ) \\equiv   \\int\\,d{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}'\\,w({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}},{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}')\\,t({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}'),\\ ] ] where the unperturbed response function is given by @xmath30 the response of the system to an external field can be calculated using the qrpa response function defined by @xcite @xmath31 for axially symmetric wave functions @xmath32 , the response function can be decomposed into multipoles as @xmath33 we assume a zero range particle - hole interaction of the form @xmath34\\,\\delta({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ' ) .",

    "if one includes the radial mesh up to @xmath42=15 fm with 0.5 fm step , there are 30 points for the @xmath42 integrals . for the interaction given by eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) , only those @xmath43 with the same parity are coupled to each other , and generally the convergence is rather quick .",
    "therefore , for the quadrupole response for example , one would include only @xmath44 and 4 . by treating proton and neutron separately ,",
    "the total dimension of the response function is 30 ( for @xmath42 ) @xmath453 ( for @xmath43 ) @xmath452 ( for @xmath46 ) = 180 .",
    "this is much smaller than the number of 2 quasi - particle configurations , which can be more than several thousands for a deformed system .",
    "we now apply the formalism to the quadrupole response of the @xmath0 mg nucleus . we assume a woods - saxon form for the mean - field potential @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( [ pot0 ] ) and ( [ potls ] ) with parameters given in ref .",
    "we take the deformation parameters @xmath6 from the results of hfb calculations with a skyrme interaction by terasaki _",
    "_ @xcite . for @xmath0 mg ,",
    "the deformation parameters are 0.33 and 0.28 for protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "notice that the deformation parameters are different for protons and neutrons by an amount of 0.05 .",
    "we use the same pairing interaction as in ref .",
    "@xcite for our bcs calculations .",
    "this is a density - dependent zero - range interaction with an energy cut - off at 5 mev above the fermi energy .",
    "although a smooth energy cut - off was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use a sharp energy cut - off for simplicity . with these parameters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 mev for the proton and the neutron fermi energies , @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 mev for the proton and the neutron average pairing gaps .",
    "for the residual interaction @xmath53 , we use the siii parameter set @xcite of the skyrme interaction with the landau - migdal approximation for the momentum dependent terms @xcite .",
    "we include the single - particle levels up to 50 mev in the calculations .",
    "the continuum states are discretized with the box discretization method with the box size of 15 fm .",
    "we have checked that the results are not altered by more than 10% even if we use a larger box size . for single - particle states above the pairing cut - off energy",
    ", we simply take @xmath54 for the bcs occupation probabilities .    since our calculations are not self - consistent in the sense that the residual interaction is not related to the mean field potential , we renormalize the residual interaction as @xmath55 so that the goldstone modes appear at zero excitation energy .",
    "for a spherical system , there is only one goldstone mode for the center - of - mass motion , and one can use a single value for the renormalization factor in order to define the effective residual interaction and study several multipole responses . in contrast , for a deformed system , the center - of - mass motion splits into two excitation modes according to the @xmath10 quantum number ( @xmath56 and 1@xmath57 ) .",
    "moreover , there is another goldstone mode associated with the rotation motion of the whole nucleus .",
    "this motion carries @xmath58 .",
    "we find that the renormalization factors required to put these modes at zero energy are significantly different from each other for the configuration space mentioned above .",
    "the renormalization factors are found to be 1.00075 for @xmath59 , 0.95585 for @xmath60 , and 1.0300 for @xmath61 .",
    "since we are interested in only the quadrupole motion in this paper , our prescription is to use @xmath62 for the other @xmath10 quantum numbers , i.e. , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that the goldstone mode for the number conservation does not appear in our calculation , since we include only the particle - hole channel in qrpa .",
    "figure 1 shows the isoscaler ( is ) quadrupole strength distribution of the @xmath0 mg nucleus ( the lower panel ) in comparison with that of the @xmath65 mg nucleus ( the upper panel ) .",
    "we set @xmath66 mev in eq .",
    "( [ pi0 ] ) in order to smear out the results for the presentation purpose .",
    "the dotted , dashed , and solid lines are for @xmath67=0@xmath68 , 1@xmath68 , and 2@xmath68 modes , respectively .",
    "since we use a density - dependent pairing interaction , there is a small coupling between the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels for the @xmath69 mode ( notice that a time - reversed pair can form only a @xmath69 state ) even in the bcs approximation , when the residual interaction is evaluated as the second derivative of the energy functional @xcite .",
    "we simply neglect this effect in this work .",
    "the @xmath67=1@xmath68 and 2@xmath68 modes are free from this approximation .    in the figure",
    ", one observes the splitting of the giant quadrupole resonances ( gqr ) @xcite in the energy region 10  20 mev both in @xmath65 mg and in @xmath0 mg .",
    "in contrast to the stable nucleus @xmath65 mg , we notice that the is gqr is more fragmented in the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath0 mg due to a large neutron contribution .",
    "we have also computed the neutron response , and found that the @xmath1 mode in the energy region 3  10 mev is almost a pure neutron mode .",
    "another interesting result is that the collectivity of the lowest @xmath1 mode is increased considerably in @xmath0 mg .",
    "this is due both to the pairing effect @xcite and to the different deformation between proton and neutron , as we discuss below .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , terasaki _ et al .",
    "_ have suggested that a low - lying quadrupole isovector mode may appear when the protons and the neutrons have different deformation parameters . in neutron - rich nuclei , the isovector and the isoscalar modes",
    "are coupled to each other @xcite , and thus this effect would also enhance the low - lying isoscalar quadrupole strength . in order to confirm this , we repeat the calculations by setting the proton and the neutron deformation parameters to be identical .",
    "figure 2 shows the low - lying part of the isoscalar quadrupole response of @xmath0 mg for the @xmath69 ( the top panel ) , @xmath61 ( the middle panel ) , and @xmath1 ( the bottom panel ) .",
    "the dotted and the dashed curves are for the case where the proton and the neutron deformations are set to be the smaller value 0.28 and the larger value 0.33 , respectively .",
    "the solid line denotes the original calculation shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the proton and the neutron have different deformations . for @xmath69 and 1@xmath68 ,",
    "those three lines are very similar to each other , while , in marked contrast , the lowest @xmath1 excitation ( the gamma vibration ) clearly shows a different behaviour .",
    "when the deformation is different between proton and neutron , the excitation energy of this stae becomes significantly smaller and at the same time the strength is increased considerably .",
    "the effect of a larger proton deformation parameter simply changes the dotted curve to the dashed curve .",
    "there is an additional effect originating from the different proton and neutron deformations , that enhances the collectivity of the gamma vibration .",
    "at present , a continuum qrpa calculation based on the hfb method is still too costly to apply to deformed nuclei . the only possible way to overcome this difficulty is to employ the bcs approximation for the pairing correlations , where the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels are decoupled .",
    "contrary to a general belief , the bcs approximation for the description of ground state properties has been shown adequate even for neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "we presume that this is the case also for the description of excited states , and have developed the qrpa method based on the bcs approximation .",
    "particularly , we have presented the response function method for deformed qrpa , which substantially reduces the computational effort to solve qrpa compared with the conventional method which diagonalises the non - hermitian qrpa matrix .",
    "we have applied the method to quadrupole responses of the deformed neutron - rich nucleus @xmath0 mg .",
    "we have shown that the collectivity of the gamma vibration is increased when the protons and the neutrons deform in a different way from each other as the mean - field calculation predicts .    in this paper , we have discretized the continuum states by putting the nucleus in a large spherical box . for a more consistent description , one would need to treat the continuum spectra exactly .",
    "this applies both to the bcs and to the qrpa calculations . in the continuum bcs calculation for the ground state ,",
    "the single - particle resonance states play an essential role @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that the coupled - channels approach with the eigenchannel basis offers an efficient way to identify a deformed single - particle resonance state through the so called eigenphase sum @xcite .",
    "we have also derived a factorization formula for the energy and the radial dependences of a scattering wave function near an isolated resonance state @xcite .",
    "this formula will be useful when one computes the matrix elements of pairing interaction over a wide energy region including the continuum spectra .",
    "as for a continuum qrpa calculation , it is well known that the exact treatment of the continuum couplings is possible if one uses the single - particle green function in the coordinate space representation @xcite .",
    "an extension of this approach to a deformed system has been done in the field of atomic and molecular physics @xcite , which again uses the coupled - channels method with the eigenchannel basis ( see also ref .",
    "we have also recently extended the green function approach to spherical open - shell nuclei within the bcs approximation @xcite .",
