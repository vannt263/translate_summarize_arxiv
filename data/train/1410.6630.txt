    "the kato - takahashi strong - coupling perturbation theory ( scpt )  @xcite and the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite are two powerful methods for studying strongly correlated quantum many - body systems such as the mott insulating phase  @xcite found in the hubbard model  @xcite with on - site interaction @xmath1 . in high dimensions the kato - takahashi scpt can be calculated exactly up to high orders in @xmath0 using a combinatorial - diagrammatic approach  @xcite while the dmft scheme becomes exact in principle .",
    "early comparisons of both methods  @xcite showed a very good agreement deep in the mott insulating phase .",
    "however , they let some open questions about the relative accuracy of different impurity solvers for dmft and the properties of the mott insulating phase close to the critical coupling @xmath2 where it becomes unstable . here , we report on a large - scale computer - algebra calculation of higher orders in the scpt series expansion and the resolution of this issue .      the nature of mott insulators without long - range magnetic order is a long - standing open problem in the theory of strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "theoretically , mott insulating phases can be found in strongly interacting fermion  @xcite or boson  @xcite systems as well as in fermion - boson mixtures  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , non - magnetic mott insulators have been found in a layered organic insulator  @xcite . in this triangular - lattice material ,",
    "the frustration of the antiferromagnetic spin exchange coupling prevents the formation of a long - range magnetic order .",
    "a mott insulator phase can also be realized in an atomic gas trapped in an optical lattice  @xcite . despite decades of extensive research ,",
    "the properties of mott insulators and , more generally , the transition from a mott insulator to a metallic ( fermion system ) or superfluid ( boson system ) phase are only partially understood and thus actively investigated .    the hubbard model with repulsive on - site",
    "interaction  @xmath3 and nearest - neighbor hopping term  @xmath4 is a basic lattice model for studying the physics of strongly interacting electrons , in particular the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite at half filling ( one electron per lattice site ) the ground state is a mott insulator for strong interaction  @xmath5 , while it is a fermi gas in the non - interacting limit  @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the system must undergo a metal - insulator transition at some coupling @xmath7 .",
    "if the lattice geometry ( defined by hopping integrals between lattice sites ) causes a strong frustration of the effective antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between electron spins , the ground state is paramagnetic .",
    "thus , this model can describe the transition from a paramagnetic mott insulator to a metallic state .",
    "the bose - hubbard model is an extension of the hubbard model to boson systems , which can be used to describe the transition from a mott insulator to a superfluid .",
    "@xcite    here we consider the hamiltonian for interacting electrons @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the standard fermion creation and annihilation operators for an electron with spin @xmath11 on the site with index @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the local density operators .",
    "to reach the limit of infinite dimensions , we choose a bethe lattice with connectivity  @xmath14 in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the last sum in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) runs over the @xmath16 lattice sites while the first sum runs over the @xmath17 pairs of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we restrict the present study to a half - filled system ( i.e. , one electron per site on average ) .",
    "the hubbard model corresponds to equal hopping terms for both spins @xmath18 while the falicov - kimball model@xcite corresponds to a single mobile electron species @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will set the unit of energy by  @xmath21 .",
    "dmft and its generalizations have become a leading approach for studying correlated electronic systems .  @xcite they have been combined with the density functional theory  @xcite to perform first - principles calculations .",
    "this dft+dmft approach is increasingly used to investigate materials with strong electronic correlations such as transition metals and their oxides .",
    "more recently , the application of dmft to quantum chemistry problems has been explored .",
    "@xcite    the mott metal - insulator transition in the hubbard model has been extensively investigated with dmft .",
    "@xcite on a bethe lattice with infinite coordination number , dmft studies have revealed a first - order quantum phase transition from a fermi liquid to a mott insulator as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the ground state is metallic up to a critical coupling @xmath22 ( which is close to @xmath23 according to qmc - dmft calculations  @xcite ) and becomes insulating above this value .",
    "however , the mott insulating state remains metastable down to a critical coupling @xmath24 where the mott - hubbard gap closes .",
    "thus , it still influences the system properties for @xmath25 and in real systems , it should be observable in experiments such as time - resolved spectroscopy .    in the dmft approach",
    ", a bulk system is mapped onto an effective self - consistent quantum impurity system . in the case of the hubbard model ,",
    "this is the well - known single impurity anderson model ( siam ) .",
    "this mapping becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions or coordination number .",
    "however , solving the quantum impurity problem is a very hard task in most cases .",
    "various `` impurity solvers '' can be used to compute the siam properties numerically .",
    "for instance , numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite methods have been used successfully for this purpose .",
    "thus , in practice , one has to solve the self - consistent impurity problem numerically and recursively .",
    "this introduces errors which are difficult to estimate within the dmft scheme .",
    "therefore , reliable results obtained with other methods are highly desirable to validate the dmft approach and evaluate its accuracy , even in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "so far , besides dmft computations , most reliable results for the hubbard model in the limit of high dimensions have been obtained using weak  @xcite and strong coupling perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the kato - takahashi scpt can be used to solve the dmft self - consistency equation .",
    "@xcite      series expansion methods , especially perturbative approaches , constitute basic theoretical tools of physics .",
    "@xcite they are often used to investigate strongly correlated lattice models such as the hubbard model .",
    "an attractive feature of these methods is that they are often well suited for the use of high - performance computer algebra .",
    "thus , one can take advantage of the computational power of modern supercomputers without losing the rigor of analytical calculations .",
    "this can be a decisive advantage over most numerical approaches , which usually have to deal with various issues brought by finite - precision algorithms and floating - point arithmetic .    in principle",
    ", the kato - takahashi perturbation expansion provides us with a systematic method for calculating the properties of the mott insulator in powers of  @xmath0 . in practice",
    ", the number of diagrams contributing to @xmath26-th order increases exponentially with  @xmath26 and thus calculations become rapidly too complex .",
    "several years ago , a direct manual calculation yielded the ground - state energy of  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) up to the 4-th order and the local green s function up to second order in  @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite these results agree well with dmrg - based dmft simulations for  @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite later , an combinatorial - diagrammatic algorithm was developed to calculate a given order exactly using computer algebra .",
    "this method allowed one of us to compute the ground - state energy exactly up to the 11-th order in  @xmath0 using moderate computational resources .",
    "@xcite the results agree very well down to  @xmath28 with dmft data obtained using a qmc method  @xcite or a dmrg method  @xcite as impurity solver .",
    "however , these studies reached different conclusions regarding the critical coupling @xmath2 where the mott insulator becomes unstable , and the related critical exponent @xmath29 . combining qmc - dmft and scpt",
    "results the first study  @xcite claimed that @xmath30 ( in agreement with other dmft calculations  @xcite ) and @xmath31 while the dmrg - dmft - based study  @xcite concluded that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , a critical coupling @xmath34 was deduced from a perturbative calculation of the mott - hubbard gap within the dmft approach .",
    "@xcite    unfortunately , even the most recent scpt study ( up to 11-th order in  @xmath0 )  @xcite was not sufficient to discriminate between the qmc and dmrg data close to @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that a series expansion truncated at any finite order becomes increasingly unreliable as one approaches a critical point ( i.e. , an analytical singularity ) and that taking higher - order into account improves the reliability .",
    "thus , in this paper we present a large - scale computer - algebra calculation which allows us to obtain the ground - state energy up to the 15-th order in  @xmath0 using the combinatorial - diagrammatic approach .",
    "the comparison of scpt and dmft results reveals that qmc - dmft agrees much better than dmrg - dmft with the 15-th order perturbation theory close to the critical regime ( down to @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , extrapolating the perturbation expansion to infinite order using the domb - sykes method  @xcite allows us to determine critical coupling @xmath35 and critical exponent @xmath36 very precisely .",
    "this critical coupling also agrees with previous dmft calculations .",
    "@xcite moreover , we find that the ground - state energies calculated with the extrapolated scpt and the qmc - dmft agree perfectly ( within @xmath37 of the band width ) even extremely close to the critical coupling , e.g. for @xmath38 .    the rest of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the high - performance computer - algebra scpt is described in the next section .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the comparison of the scpt results with the dmrg - dmft and qmc - dmft data as well as the extrapolated perturbation theory .",
    "finally , the perspective for further development and applications of the combinatorial - diagrammatic scpt are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the ground - state energy per lattice site @xmath39 of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can be written as a series in power of @xmath0 using the kato - takahashi strong - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite at  @xmath40 ( or equivalently @xmath41 ) the ground - state energy is @xmath42 and the corresponding eigenstates have exactly one electron localized on each lattice site .",
    "as the spin orientation does not change the energy , the ground state is degenerate .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the corresponding eigenspace .",
    "its dimension is @xmath44 for an @xmath16-site lattice .",
    "let @xmath45 be the projection operator onto the lowest - energy eigenspace of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) at finite @xmath1 .",
    "( obviously , @xmath45 is the projector onto @xmath46 for @xmath40 . ) using the generic kato perturbation theory , takahashi showed for the hubbard model in the strong - coupling limit that this operator can be written as a power series in @xmath0 @xmath47 with integers @xmath48 such that @xmath49 . at half filling , this power series has a finite convergence radius @xmath50 and that depends on the lattice properties .",
    "the operators @xmath51 are defined by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the projector on the subspace of states with exactly  @xmath54 doubly occupied sites .",
    "let us assume that @xmath55 is a state in @xmath46 with the property @xmath56 .",
    "( there must be at least one such state if the series expansion for @xmath45 has a finite convergence radius . )",
    "then the ground - state energy for finite @xmath0 is given by @xmath57 using  ( [ eq : projector ] ) , we can expand this energy in power of @xmath0 @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "although one can not write closed formula for the coefficients @xmath60 in general , they are completely defined by the equations  ( [ eq : projector ] ) , ( [ eq : operator ] ) , and  ( [ eq : energy ] ) for a given lattice and a given hopping operator @xmath61 .      a combinatorial - diagrammatic approach was developed by one of us to evaluate the coefficients @xmath60 for the hubbard and falicov - kimball models on a bethe lattice with an infinite coordination number .",
    "@xcite here we summarize the key ideas which are necessary to understand our new implementation of this approach and we refer the reader to the original publications for more details . expanding the projector  ( [ eq : projector ] ) in the energy  ( [ eq : energy ] ) , we see that the coefficients @xmath60 are given by sums of expectation values of the form @xmath62 which are called processes",
    ". different sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : projector ] ) , ( [ eq : operator ] ) , and  ( [ eq : process ] ) correspond to different processes .",
    "the number of different sets @xmath63 in the projector  ( [ eq : projector ] ) is @xmath65 for the @xmath26th order and thus increases exponentially as @xmath66 for high orders @xmath26 . the number of different sets @xmath64 scales as @xmath67 .",
    "thus the number of possible processes increases exponentially fast with the order @xmath26 .",
    "the state @xmath68 is an eigenstate of the double occupation operator @xmath69 and thus has a precise number of doubly occupied sites ( zero at half filling ) while the hopping operator @xmath61 can change the number of doubly occupied sites by at most one .",
    "consequently , only some particular sets @xmath64 can yield a non - zero expectation value  ( [ eq : process ] ) . then using the definition of the hopping operator @xmath61 in eq",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) each process can be evaluated as the sum of simple expectation values @xmath70 ( called sequences ) over lattice sites and spin indices .",
    "the sequence length is @xmath71 . the number of different sequences in a process increases exponentially fast with the order @xmath26 , roughly as @xmath72 for a process containing @xmath73 hopping operators @xmath61 .",

    "< 1 + 11 & 193 & 1099056000 & & 1 & 18 & min .",
    "& < 1 + 13 & 795 & 310007943616 & & 128 & 12 & min . & 36 + 15 & 3412 & 119777421416192 & & 128 & 77 & hours & 528 + 17 & 14803 & < 80465810 ^ 11 & & 262144 & 13 & days & 131 +    therefore , the evaluation of the coefficients @xmath60 in the series  ( [ eq : series ] ) is a hard computational problem .",
    "however , the computational cost can be greatly reduced if one identifies without explicit calculation the many processes and sequences which vanish or are equivalent .",
    "for instance , processes can be gathered into a small number of classes defined by the positions @xmath74 of the indices @xmath75 in the list @xmath63 .",
    "then the processes in a given class are only compatible with particular sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 as well as a reduced number of sequences because an intermediate state @xmath76 without any doubly occupied site must be reached every time that @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : process ] ) ] .",
    "the actual number @xmath78 of inequivalent non - zero processes in our implementation is given in the second column of table  [ table1 ] for several orders @xmath26 .",
    "the above discussion is valid for any lattice . on a bethe lattice with an infinite coordination number @xmath14 ,",
    "however , the evaluation of sequences and processes can be considerably simplified .",
    "first , it was shown  @xcite that the degeneracy of the singlet ground state for @xmath40 is not lifted up to the third order in  @xmath0 ( if one excludes long - range spin orders such as anti - ferromagnetism ) . assuming that this holds for all orders , we can use any singlet state @xmath79 or , equivalently , an average over an orthonormal basis of the singlet subspace in @xmath46 .",
    "( this averaging greatly simplifies the evaluation of sequences as we will see below . )",
    "moreover , an expectation value  ( [ eq : sequence ] ) vanishes unless each creation operator @xmath80 in the sequence is matched by a corresponding annihilation operator @xmath81 .",
    "thus the site set @xmath82 in a sequence  ( [ eq : sequence ] ) describes one or more closed paths on the lattice .",
    "as the operator @xmath61 contains hoppings between nearest - neighbor sites only , each segment of the path connects two nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "moreover , as loops are not possible on a bethe lattice , the path is self - retracing and any nearest - neighbor bond can only appear an even number of times in a closed path . finally , segments occurring more than twice yield contributions of the order of @xmath83 or smaller and thus are negligible in the limit of an infinite coordination number .    some other generic properties can be used to further simplify the problem . as the total energy must be extensive , disconnected paths resulting from the expansion of numerator and denominator in the ratio  ( [ eq : energy ] ) must compensate each other and thus only sequences corresponding to a single connected path of length @xmath84 yield non - zero contributions in the @xmath26th order .",
    "this property is sometimes called a linked - cluster theorem but in the present context it is more a physical argument than a mathematical theorem .",
    "it was only proven exactly up to the fifth order in @xmath0 in ref .  .",
    "a detailed analysis of the linked - cluster theorem within the kato - takahashi perturbation theory also indicates that it should be valid for the mott - insulating phase of the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "@xcite finally , all lattice sites are equivalent as we assume that the lattice is infinitely large ( @xmath85 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the only non - zero contributions to processes  ( [ eq : process ] ) come from sequences  ( [ eq : sequence ] ) corresponding to a single , closed , and self - retracing path of even length @xmath84 through @xmath86 different bonds and @xmath87 different sites .",
    "this has three important consequences .",
    "first , only processes corresponding to an even power of the hopping operator @xmath61 , or equivalently an odd power of @xmath0 , contribute to the ground - state energy at half filling .",
    "second , after reordering the fermion operators , any contributing sequences can be written as a correlation function @xmath88 between all sites in a path of length @xmath73 .",
    "computing the average of the energy  ( [ eq : energy ] ) over an orthonormal basis of the singlet subspace in @xmath46 reduces to averaging these correlation functions . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath85",
    "all spin configurations of a finite cluster are equiprobable if one averages over all singlet states of the full system .",
    "thus we can simply compute the mean value of the correlation function over both spin states @xmath89 at each site in the path .",
    "we find then that the average value of a correlation function depends only on the path length @xmath73 ( and so on the order @xmath26 ) and is simply a rational number @xmath90 .",
    "third , the distinct linked clusters occurring in contributing sequences can be represented one to one by diagrams called butcher trees.@xcite generating all these clusters corresponds to generating all butcher trees with @xmath91  nodes .",
    "we have to use colored butcher trees with four distinct colors corresponding to the four possible states ( unoccupied , spin-@xmath92 , spin-@xmath93 , and doubly occupied ) of an electronic site to represent the initial spin configurations in @xmath94 and the intermediate states  ( [ eq : intermediate ] ) of a sequence . after constructing all @xmath26th order butcher trees , all possible sequences on them",
    "can be generated starting from the graph root using a recursive electron hopping procedure , which takes into account the physical restrictions such as the pauli principle .",
    "therefore , the evaluation of the coefficients @xmath60 in the series  ( [ eq : series ] ) is reduced to a ( hard ) combinatorial - diagrammatic problem .",
    "a combinatorial - diagrammatic approach was used to calculate the coefficients @xmath60 exactly up to @xmath95 for both the hubbard model and the falicov - kimball model using a proof - of - concept computer program and moderate computer resources .",
    "@xcite based on the original program , one of us ( mp ) has implemented a high - performance computer - algebra program that calculates the coefficients @xmath60 exactly for a given odd @xmath26 ( as @xmath96 for all even @xmath26 at half filling ) .",
    "the coefficients are written @xmath97 where @xmath98 for the falicov - kimball model and @xmath99 for the hubbard model .",
    "the first sum runs over all @xmath100 process classes @xmath101 .",
    "the sum over the index @xmath102 represents the sum over all sequences  ( [ eq : sequence ] ) which are compatible with the process class @xmath101 .",
    "the sequences for the falicov - kimball model are a subset of those for the hubbard model .",
    "a set of double occupancy number @xmath103 is associated with each sequence @xmath102 and @xmath104 is the overall sign of this sequence from the fermion commutation relations .",
    "the total number @xmath105 of all sequences in all classes is given in the third column of table  [ table1 ] up to the order @xmath106 .",
    "the sum over the index @xmath107 in  ( [ eq : sum ] ) represents the sum over all inequivalent elementary processes  ( [ eq : process ] ) in the class @xmath101 .",
    "these processes are the same for the falicov - kimball model and the hubbard model .",
    "a set of exponents @xmath108 is associated with each elementary process @xmath107 and @xmath109 gives the number of equivalent elementary processes .",
    "the total number @xmath78 of all processes in all classes is given in the second column of table  [ table1 ] up to the order @xmath110 .",
    "we see that @xmath105 increases faster than @xmath111 .",
    "this apparently disagrees with the above analysis which predicts at most an exponential increase of the number of processes and sequences with @xmath26 .",
    "however , the exponential behavior is obtained for a finite lattice @xmath16 and a finite coordination number @xmath14 and thus does not preclude a factorial behavior in the limits @xmath112 . for orders up to @xmath95 the computation of ( [ eq : sum ] ) can be easily carried out on a workstation .",
    "our optimized and parallelized implementation of this combinatorial - diagrammatic algorithm has allowed us to carry out the calculation up to the order @xmath106 using high - performance supercomputers .",
    "this implementation represents about @xmath113  lines of ansi - c code ( comments excluded ) .",
    "the program uses only integer numerics with a `` global '' denominator instead of slower rational numbers .",
    "thus the coefficients @xmath60 are obtained as exact rational numbers .",
    "we have found that standard @xmath114-bit integers are enough up to the 13-th order but @xmath115-bit ones are required for the 15-th order . for the 17-th order , integers with @xmath116 bits or more would be necessary . in practice , we use the gnu multiple precision arithmetic library ( gmp )  @xcite , which provides integers of arbitrary length .    to optimize the program we have implemented the necessary algorithms as fast operations on our bit - coded data structures .",
    "these include standard combinatorial algorithms , e.g. for sorting and permuting ,  @xcite as well as more specialized ones , e.g. for computing the overall sign from all fermion operator commutations in a sequence .",
    "thus our implementation is self - contained and does not require any special software library except gmp .",
    "a further optimization of several algorithms was achieved thanks to an independent graph - theoretical analysis of the representation of sequences by colored butcher trees .",
    "@xcite this analysis was carried out using the functional programming language haskell , which provides a concise high - level mathematical environment for this purpose , e.g. native support for graph structures .",
    "in addition , we have used the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences ( oeis )  @xcite to analyze the various integer sequences which occur in intermediate steps of the combinatorial - diagrammatic algorithm and thus verify some intermediate results .",
    "this analysis has also helped us to improve the overall program efficiency .",
    "in contrast to the proof  of  concept implementation in ref .  , our implementation consists of a single program . to generate all contributing sequences @xmath102 in  ( [ eq : sum ] )",
    ", it iterates in parallel over all initial states ( i.e. , spin configurations in @xmath117 ) in an outer loop while an inner loop runs over all combinations of nearest - neighbor pairs using a recursive electron hopping procedure . a trade - off between cpu time and memory usage",
    "can be achieved if one initially calculates once and stores the possible sequence weights [ i.e. , the sum over the elementary processes @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) ] for all double occupancy sets @xmath103 .",
    "then during the summation over the sequences @xmath102 , one uses the stored weight for the set @xmath103 corresponding to each sequence .",
    "this preprocessing of sequence weights yields a significant speed - up at the cost of a higher memory requirement .",
    "for instance , preprocessing reduces the cpu time by a factor  @xmath118 for the 15-th order , which offsets the higher computational cost of the gmp library compared to fixed - length integers . theoretically , the required memory for the sequence - generating subroutine increases from @xmath119 without preprocessing to @xmath120 with preprocessing , while the main program needs a constant amount @xmath121 .",
    "in addition , this method results in an unfavorable memory scaling in a parallel computation as the total memory now increases linearly with the number of processors while it remains almost constant without preprocessing . as an example , for the order @xmath106 , @xmath122  gb for each processor plus @xmath123  gb of shared memory are used with preprocessing against only @xmath123 gb overall without preprocessing .",
    "our code has been designed for running efficiently on parallel supercomputers . for an efficient handling of shared data by the specialized combinatorial functions ,",
    "we have limited ourselves to symmetric multiprocessor ( smp ) computer architectures so far . due to the ideal data parallelism in our implementation as well as to a fine - tuned load balancing , the scaling behavior of the computing time is excellent on all tested machines , at least up to @xmath124 processor cores on a ` sgi altix  4700 ` and up to @xmath116 processor cores on the much more powerful ` hp integrity superdome  2 - 32s ` . a simple analysis on basis of amdahl s law gives @xmath125 code parallelism .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , calculating the sum  ( [ eq : sum ] ) for @xmath126 remain computationally demanding and we have to carry out large - scale calculations on smp machines with hundreds of processors to obtain the 13th and 15th orders in @xmath0 . the wall time used and the required memory are shown in table  [ table1 ] for calculations performed using the preprocessing method on a ` hp  9000  j6750 ` workstation ( orders @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) and a ` hp integrity superdome  2 - 16s ` server ( orders @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) . in table  [ table1 ] , we also show our estimates for the order @xmath110 using a massively parallel processing ( mpp ) supercomputer such as the ` ibm  bluegene / q ` with @xmath131  processors .",
    "note that the preprocessing method could not be used on this computer system without modification because the available memory per processor would be too low .",
    "the validity and performance of our program were also tested on the falicov - kimball model  @xcite using a state - of - the - art smp supercomputer ( ` hp integrity superdome  x ` ) . as a result",
    ", we can confirm that there is no contribution to the ground - state energy ( beyond the first order term ) up to the 17th order in @xmath0 , i.e. 6 orders higher than in a previous work .",
    "@xcite this test also allows us to estimate the computational cost for the 17-th order in the hubbard model .",
    "it shows that @xmath132  tb of memory would be required with preprocessing on the @xmath133  processor cores of the ` hp integrity superdome  x ` and that the calculation would last more than one year ( while the test for the falicov - kimball model only took @xmath134  hours ) .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the next order in the hubbard model series expansion does not seem to be possible with current smp machines .",
    "nevertheless , it appears to be technically possible with current mpp supercomputers such as the ` ibm  bluegene / q ` , although we could not use the current implementation of the preprocessing and the computational cost , about @xmath135  days , would still be very high in practice .",
    "in table  [ table1 ] , we present the coefficients @xmath60 of the power series for the ground - state energy  ( [ eq : series ] ) in the half - filled hubbard model up to the order @xmath106 .",
    "( only coefficients for odd @xmath26 are listed as they vanish for all even @xmath26 . )",

    "we have investigated the ground - state energy in the mott insulating phase of the hubbard model on a bethe lattice with infinite coordination number using a combinatorial - diagrammatic approach based on the kato - takahashi strong - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "first , we have carried out large - scale computer - algebra calculations to obtain the exact coefficients @xmath60 of the series expansion  ( [ eq : series ] ) up to the 15-th order in @xmath0 .",
    "then , a domb - sykes analysis of the series asymptotic behavior has allowed us to determine its singular behavior close to the critical coupling @xmath2 below which the mott phase becomes unstable .",

    "the dmft method  @xcite is a complex numerical technique and the result quality depends not only on the impurity solver used ( e.g. , dmrg , qmc or nrg ) but also on the chosen discretization scheme for the continuous self - consistency equation .",

    "is probably due to the discretization scheme used in that work . indeed , an essential step of this particular scheme is the deconvolution of the impurity density of states calculated with dmrg . in a recent work  @xcite , two of us have shown that the deconvolution procedure used in ref .",
    "slightly distorts the shape of the density of states in a one - dimensional paramagnetic mott - hubbard insulator .",

    "the computer - algebra scpt method presented in sec .",
    "( [ sec : method ] ) can be extended to various generalizations of the hubbard model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "for instance , one could vary @xmath213 continuously to interpolate between the hubbard model ( @xmath214 ) and the falicov - kimball model ( @xmath215 ) or one could study hubbard models with several bands  @xcite or internal @xmath216 symmetries with large @xmath26 .  @xcite kato perturbation theory has already been applied to the mott insulating phase in the strong - coupling limit of the bose - hubbard model with spinless bosons .",
    "@xcite in that case , the unperturbated ground state is not degenerate and thus the perturbation series can easily be computed up to high orders . for bosons with spin  @xmath217 , however , the degeneracy of the unperturbated ground state duplicates the situation encountered in the hubbard model for electrons .",
    "thus , the approach that we have used for the fermionic hubbard model can also be applied to a spin - disordered mott phase in the bose - hubbard model with spin  @xmath218 as well as to mott phases of other fermion systems and of boson - fermion mixtures in optical lattices .",
    "@xcite    however , an essential condition for the computer - algebra scpt used in this work is the conservation of the singlet ground - state degeneracy at all orders in the series expansion , which allows one to evaluate the correlation functions  ( [ eq : correlations ] ) easily .",
    "if this property is not fulfilled , an exact calculation of the relevant correlation functions could become much more difficult or even impossible .",
    "then one would have to be content with ( possibly numerical ) approximations for the coefficients @xmath60 of the perturbation series . obviously , this degeneracy at finite coupling is a model property and thus the applicability of our method has to be checked on a case to case basis .",
    "the loss of degeneracy seems also to be the most serious difficulty in extending the combinatorial - diagrammatic approach to the hubbard model away from half filling and , more generally , to metallic phases in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "indeed , away from half filling the degeneracy of the @xmath40 ground state is already partially lifted in first order in the hopping term @xmath61 .",
    "again , this seems to imply that one could only obtain approximate series coefficients @xmath60 away from half filling .",
    "similarly , we could employ the computer - algebra scpt as an approximation method for the hubbard model on other lattice geometries than the bethe lattice and for finite dimensions or coordination numbers .",
    "( the dmft method is already used as an approximative method for treating strong electronic correlations in finite dimensional systems , for instance , in first - principles studies of three - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite )    one of the open problems in the theory of mott insulators is the shape of the hubbard bands in the single - particle density of states ( dos ) . in particular , dmft calculations reveal some unexplained sharp structures at the low - energy edges of the hubbard bands in both the mott insulating phase  @xcite and the metallic phase  @xcite in the critical region .",
    "the dos of the mott insulating phase has been calculated perturbatively up to the second order in  @xmath0 directly from the hubbard model  @xcite and up to the third order by solving the dmft self - consistency equation  @xcite .",
    "however , these results do not fully explain the observed structures .",
    "moreover , the dmft results for the dos depend sensitively on the scheme used to solve the self - consistent impurity problem  @xcite . in that case",
    "we are clearly in need of more accurate results , such as higher - order terms in the perturbation expansion .    in principle",
    ", the combinatorial - diagrammatic approach can be extended to the calculation of the local single - particle green s function , which determines the dos and the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "the series expansion can be formulated as a self - consistent integral equation for the green s function at finite @xmath1 .",
    "the equation contains polynomials of the green s function at @xmath219 with increasing orders .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomials can be calculated using a similar combinatorial - diagrammatic approach as the coefficients for the series expansion of the ground - state energy  ( [ eq : series ] ) .",
    "however , the computational cost appears to be significantly higher for the green s function than for the ground state series expansion .",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether we can obtain an exact solution with combinatorial - diagrammatic techniques only , because methods from numerical analysis could be required to solve the self - consistent integral equation .",
    "nevertheless , it would be worthwhile to calculate even only a few higher order contributions to the green s function . knowing higher - order contributions to dos and gap would allow us to determine the critical coupling @xmath2 and the critical exponent @xmath29 more accurately and thus to gain a better understanding of the paramagnetic mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "moreover , this would provide us with a more direct and thorough benchmarking of numerical dmft methods because they are actually based on self - consistent computations of the green s function .",
    "the development of the combinatorial - diagrammatic approach to the kato - takahashi scpt has greatly benefited from a formal mathematical study of its algorithms .",
    "@xcite discrete mathematics rather than differential calculus provides the mathematical background for this approach .",
    "further development of similar computer - algebra perturbation methods will require a close cooperation between physics and discrete mathematics which will benefit both fields .",
    "indeed , we have not only used the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences ( oeis )  @xcite to obtain information on known integer sequences but also contributed new ones .",
    "for instance , the number of sequences @xmath105 in table  [ table1 ] is the integer sequence a198761 in oeis .",
    "the computer - algebra techniques developed in this work for large - scale computations of the kato - takahashi scpt could also be applied to other series expansions .",
    "@xcite for instance , the method of continuous unitary transformations can be used to map the hubbard model at strong coupling onto an effective model with conservation of the number of double occupancies  @xcite .",
    "using appropriate truncation schemes one can close , and thus solve , the flow equations  @xcite of the effective hamiltonians .",
    "this results in a systematic expansion of the effective hamiltonian and other observables in powers of  @xmath0 , which is very similar to kato perturbation expansion .",
    "one possible approach is a truncation of the equations in a perturbative manner to obtain a series expansion .",

    "<S> we present a large - scale combinatorial - diagrammatic computation of high - order contributions to the strong - coupling kato - takahashi perturbation series for the hubbard model in high dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state energy of the mott - insulating phase is determined exactly up to the 15th order in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation expansion is extrapolated to infinite order and the critical behavior is determined using the domb - sykes method . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the perturbative results with two dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) calculations using a quantum monte carlo method and a density - matrix renormalization group method as impurity solvers . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison demonstrates the excellent agreement and accuracy of both extrapolated strong - coupling perturbation theory and quantum monte carlo based dmft , even close to the critical coupling where the mott insulator becomes unstable . </S>"
