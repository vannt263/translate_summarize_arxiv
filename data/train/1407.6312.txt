    "the quantities of interest in this paper are the maximum euclidean norm @xmath5 and the euclidean diameter @xmath6 of the sample , that is @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the euclidean norm in @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath5 as @xmath9 tends to infinity is a classical univariate extreme value problem .",
    "its solution is well known .",
    "if the distribution of @xmath10 is in the domain of attraction of some extreme value distribution , then @xmath5 , suitably renormalized , converges weakly to this distribution .",
    "we are interested in this paper only in the case where the limiting distribution is the gumbel law .",
    "more precisely , the working assumption of this paper will be that there exist two sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , or equivalently , @xmath17 the asymptotic behavior of the diameter of the sample cloud is also an extreme value problem since @xmath6 is a maximum , but it is a non standard one , because of the dependency between the pairs @xmath18 .",
    "this problem has been recently investigated by @xcite for spherically distributed vectors , that is , vectors having the representation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is uniformly distributed on the euclidean unit sphere @xmath21 of @xmath3 and @xmath22 is a positive random variable in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution , independent of @xmath20 .",
    "this reference also contains a review of the literature concerning other domains of attractions .",
    "if @xmath23 , a spherical random variable is simply a symmetric random variable , that is a positive random variable multiplied by an independent random sign .",
    "the diameter of a real valued sample is simply its maximum minus its minimum , and by independence and symmetry , it is straightforward to check that @xmath24 converges weakly to the sum of two independent gumbel random variables with location parameter  @xmath25 , i.e.  distributed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a standard gumbel random variable .",
    "note that the tail of such a sum is heavier than the tail of one gumbel random variable .    if @xmath28 , @xcite have shown that in spite of the dependency , the limiting distribution is the gumbel law , but a correction is needed .",
    "precisely , they proved that if  ( [ eq : domaine ] ) holds , with an additional mild uniformity condition , there exists a sequence @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the exact expression of the sequence @xmath29 will be given in the comments after theorem  [ theo : diam - k>1 ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath33 converges in probability to 1 , but the behaviors of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are subtly different .",
    "specifically , @xmath34 is typically a power of @xmath35 , so @xmath36 is of order @xmath37 .",
    "it is possible to give some rationale for the presence of the diverging correcting factor  @xmath38 in  ( [ eq : jj - spherique ] ) . in dimension one ,",
    "two vectors with a large norm may be either on the same side of the origin or on opposite sides . in the latter case",
    "their distance is automatically large , typically twice as large as the norm of each one . in higher dimensions ,",
    "two spherical vectors with a large norm can be close to each other and their distance will be typically much smaller than twice the norm of the largest one .",
    "therefore we expect the probability that the diameter is large to be smaller in the latter case .",
    "this suggests that the asymptotic behavior of the diameter is related to the localization of vectors with large norm .",
    "the behavior will differ if large values are to be found in some specific regions of the space or can be found anywhere .",
    "there are many possible directions to extend the results of @xcite .",
    "one very simple case not covered by these results is the multivariate gaussian distribution with correlated components .",
    "the gaussian distribution is a particular case of elliptical distributions .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the behavior of the diameter of a sample cloud of elliptical vectors .",
    "elliptical vectors are widely used in extreme value theory since they are in the domain of attraction of multivariate extreme value distributions .",
    "these distributions and their generalizations have been recently considered in the apparently unrelated problem of obtaining limiting conditional distributions given one component is extreme , see @xcite and the references therein .    in this paper ,",
    "the tail behavior of a product @xmath39 , where @xmath22 is in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution and @xmath1 is a bounded positive random variable independent of  @xmath22 , was obtained as a by - product of the main result . under some regularity assumption on the density of @xmath1 at its maximum ,",
    "the tail of @xmath39 is slightly lighter than the tail of @xmath22 .",
    "the main reason is that if a random variable @xmath22 is in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution , then for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 this implies that for @xmath39 to be large , @xmath1 must be very close to its maximum .",
    "the full strength of this remark was recently exploited in @xcite who obtained the rate of convergence of @xmath1 towards its maximum when the product @xmath39 is large and the conditional limiting distribution of the difference between @xmath1 and its maximum , suitably renormalized .",
    "this property explains deeply the conditional limits obtained in @xcite .",
    "having in mind the earlier remarks on the link between the localization of the vectors with large norm and the asymptotic distribution of the diameter , it is clear that this localization property will be helpful to study the problem at hand in this paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : elliptic ] , we will define elliptical vectors and state our main results . in section  [ theo : norm - ddim ] , extending the results of  @xcite",
    ", we will show that the realizations of a @xmath0-dimensional random elliptical vector with large norm are localized on a subspace of  @xmath3 whose dimension is the multiplicity of the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix .",
    "this result will be crucial to prove our main results which are stated in section  [ sec : diameter ] .",
    "as partially conjectured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5.4 ) , if the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix is simple , then the limiting distribution of the diameter is similar but not equal to the one which arises when  @xmath23 : correcting terms appear that are due the fluctuations around the direction of the largest eigenvalue .",
    "if the largest eigenvalue is not simple , say its multiplicity is @xmath42 , then the diameter behaves as in the spherical case in dimension @xmath42 , up to constants .    in section  [ sec : lq - spherical ] , we will answer another question of @xcite , namely we will investigate the @xmath43 diameter of a cloud of spherical vectors , for @xmath44 .",
    "this problem is actually simpler than the corresponding one in euclidean ( @xmath45 ) norm , since the vectors with large norm are always localized close to a finite number of directions .",
    "therefore , the `` localization principle '' applies and we obtain the same type of limiting distribution as in the case of an elliptical distribution with simple largest eigenvalue . for @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "the problem simplifies even further since the corrective terms vanish and the limiting distribution of the one dimensional case is obtained .    in section  [ sec : bidim ] ,",
    "we discuss further possible generalizations and give several bidimensional examples .",
    "we think that beyond answering certain questions on the diameter of a random cloud , the main purpose of this paper is to emphasize the use of the localization principle of vectors with large norm in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution",
    ". this principle should be useful in other problems .",
    "a random vector @xmath48 in @xmath3 has an elliptical distribution if it can be expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath22 is a positive random variable , @xmath50 is an invertible @xmath51 matrix and @xmath52 is uniformly distributed on the sphere @xmath21 .",

    "one possibility is to consider a random vector @xmath48 that has the representation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a random vector on the sphere @xmath21 , no longer assumed to be uniformly distributed , and @xmath22 is a positive random variable , independent of @xmath20 .",
    "a second possibility is to assume that the vector @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath518 , where @xmath20 is uniformly distributed on @xmath21 and @xmath294 is a bounded continuous function .",
    "this model includes the previous one if the function @xmath294 takes values in the unit sphere .",
    "these models were used by @xcite and @xcite in the investigation of conditional limit laws of a bivariate vector given that one component is extreme .",
    "in such a model , the behavior of the vector given that its norm is large and the behavior of the diameter will be determined by the maxima of the function @xmath519 . if they are isolated points , the localization phenomenon will arise and results such as theorem  [ coro : norm - ddim ] and  [ theo : diam - k=1 ] may be obtained .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath294 is constant on non empty open subsets of the sphere , we rather expect to obtain results similar to theorem  [ theo : diam - k>1 ] .",
    "another way to generalize the elliptical distributions is to consider vectors whose distribution has a density on @xmath3 of the form @xmath520 where @xmath1 is a continuous function on @xmath3 and the level sets of @xmath1 are closed and convex and @xmath1 satisfies some type of multivariate regular variation or asymptotic homogeneity .",
    "this type of assumptions has been used in @xcite to obtain conditional limit laws of a vector given that one component is extreme and by @xcite in the study of the longest edge of the minimum spanning tree of a random sample .",
    "we leave this last direction as the subject of future research . in the following subsections ,",
    "we give without proof several bidimensional examples .",
    "we only consider the euclidean norm .",
    "assume that @xmath521 where @xmath22 and @xmath522 are independent and the support of the distribution of @xmath522 is @xmath523 $ ] , @xmath524 $ ] .",
    "in this case , it holds that @xmath525 and as previously , we denote the quantile of order @xmath103 of @xmath10 by @xmath34 and define @xmath526 .",
    "the main question in this case is the existence of nearly diametrically opposed vectors in the sample cloud .",
    "if @xmath527 , then there will be none , and therefore the diameter can not behave like twice the norm .",
    "the case @xmath528 is trivial since @xmath529 if the angle between @xmath530 and @xmath531 is less than @xmath532 . in concrete terms , the distance between two points whose angle is less than @xmath532 is always smaller than their norms .",
    "this implies that @xmath533 .",
    "define @xmath534 and let @xmath535 and @xmath234 be points in the sample such that @xmath536 and @xmath537 .",
    "then , by the triangle inequality @xmath538 therefore we conclude that @xmath539 and @xmath540    if @xmath541 , then there will be no vectors nearly diametrically opposed , but this case will differ from the case @xmath542 $ ] only by constants . as can be seen from the proof of theorem  [ theo : diam - k>1 ] and (",
