    "rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( or rxj1856 , hereafter ) is one of the brightest , nearby isolated neutron stars discovered by rosat @xcite as an x - ray source and a large number of papers have been devoted to explaining its nature",
    ". its soft x - ray spectrum can be well fit by the planckian spectrum with a temperature @xmath0ev @xcite .",
    "thus it is supposed that the emission of this source is of thermal nature . however , the existing models based on this original assumption face problems .",
    "the lack of any significant spectral lines in the x - ray spectrum of rxj1856 argues against heavy element atmosphere models @xcite , whereas single temperature hydrogen atmosphere fits over - predict the optical flux by a large factor @xcite . as none of the classic models of neutron star atmosphere",
    "are able to explain the observed x - ray spectrum , which is well fitted by a simple blackbody model @xcite , it has been proposed that the star has no atmosphere but a condensed matter surface @xcite .",
    "this surface might emit a virtually featureless blackbody - like spectrum ( as originally proposed by @xcite ) . since the broadband spectra of this source can not be fitted by a single planckian spectrum , it is often described by two - temperature blackbody models @xcite .",
    "however , condensation of surface matter requires very specific conditions to be fulfilled @xcite . but",
    "even if these conditions are satisfied , the formation of a non - uniform distribution of the surface temperature ( two - temperature blackbody models ) still remains unclear .",
    "the most adequate fits of the spectra give models which assume that the star has a thin hydrogen atmosphere superposed on a condensed matter surface @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of such thin hydrogen layers fitting the data is a problematic issue .",
    "alternatively , the observational properties of rxj1856 can be explained in the framework of the plasma emission model presented in previous papers @xcite , which are based on well - developed theory of pulsars .",
    "this model suggests that the emission from this object is generated by synchrotron radiation , created as the result of acquirement of pitch angles by relativistic electrons during the quasi - linear stage of the cyclotron instability .",
    "the model gives successful fits for broadband spectra , without facing the problems typical for the thermal radiation models .",
    "considering the case of a nearly aligned rotator , it was predicted that the source should have pulsated with a period of @xmath1 s @xcite .",
    "however , the posterior xmm - newton observation of rxj1856 discovered that its x - ray emission pulsates with a period of @xmath2 s @xcite .",
    "the latter fact has been explained in the framework of drift wave driven model @xcite . in particular , the real spin period of",
    "the pulsar might differ from the observable one , as a consequence of the existence of very low frequency drift waves in the region of generation of the pulsar emission .",
    "these waves are not directly observable but only result in a periodical change of curvature of the magnetic field lines and , hence , a periodical change of the emission direction with a period of the drift waves assumed to be equal to the observable period @xcite .",
    "we are not about to reject the existing thermal radiation models for rxj1856 and suppose that the most reliable argument for revealing the real emission nature of this source will be its study with polarization instruments .",
    "therefore in present paper the polarization properties of rxj1856 are investigated , in the framework of the plasma emission model developed in previous works @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we give a description of the emission model in ( sect .",
    "2 ) , investigate the emission polarization in ( sect .",
    "3 ) and discuss our results in ( sect .",
    "it is well known that the distribution function of relativistic particles is one dimensional at the pulsar surface , because any transverse momenta ( @xmath3 ) of relativistic electrons are lost in a very short time ( @xmath4s ) via synchrotron emission in very strong @xmath5 g magnetic fields . for typical pulsars ,",
    "the plasma consists of the following components : the bulk of plasma with an average lorentz - factor @xmath6 ; the tail of the distribution function with @xmath7 and the primary beam with @xmath8 ( see fig.1 from @xcite ) .",
    "generation of waves is possible during the further motion of the relativistic particles along the dipolar magnetic field lines if the condition of cyclotron resonance is fulfilled @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the particle velocity along the magnetic field , @xmath13 is the lorentz - factor for the resonant particles , @xmath14 is the drift velocity of the particles due to curvature of the field lines , @xmath15 is the radius of curvature of the field lines and @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency . here a cylindrical coordinate system is chosen , with the @xmath17-axis directed perpendicular to the plane of field line , when @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the radial and azimuthal coordinates .",
    "the reason for the generation of such waves is an anisotropy of the distribution function . during the quasi - linear stage of the instability ,",
    "a diffusion of particles arises not only along but also across the magnetic field lines .",
    "the resonant electrons , therefore , acquire transverse momenta and , as a result , start to radiate through the synchrotron mechanism .    in @xcite",
    ", it has been assumed that the emission of rxj1856 is generated by the synchrotron mechanism , which switches on during the cyclotron instability developed at distances @xmath20 cm .",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum is a result of radiation of the primary - beam electrons .",
    "particularly , the synchrotron spectrum of the beam electrons with the energy distribution : @xmath21,\\ ] ] well matches the measured x - ray spectrum in the energy interval @xmath22kev ( here @xmath23 - is the half - width of the distribution function , @xmath24 is the density of primary beam electrons , equal to the goldreich - julian density @xcite and @xmath25 is the pulsar spin period .",
    "the wave excitation leads to a redistribution of the resonant particles via quasi - linear diffusion .",
    "consequently , by achieving the stationary mode the distribution function of the beam electrons takes the following form : @xmath26 at the same time the radiation density appears to be sufficiently high and prevents the domination of the self - absorption processes .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption redistributes the emission spectrum and , in the energy domain of relatively low frequencies it experiences drop . hence , for the energy interval @xmath27kev the x - ray emission spectrum has the form @xmath28 , which fits well the observed one ( see fig.4 from @xcite ) .",
    "the measured optical spectrum is the result of the synchrotron emission of the tail electrons , redistributed due to cyclotron instability : @xmath29 the resulting theoretical spectrum matches the measured one closely .",
    "* is the emission direction , * * b * * - the magnetic field line , * v * and * @xmath30 * - are the electrons velocities.,width=2 ]    now let us consider the polarization properties of rxj1856 .",
    "for this reason , we have to find the stokes parameters , which , in our case , are defined as follows @xcite : @xmath31d\\chi d\\gamma ,      \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32d\\chi d \\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33d\\chi d \\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath34 where @xmath35    @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the angle between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 - is the pitch angle , @xmath41 is the angle between the wave vector and the electron velocity vector ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "also , @xmath42 is the lorentz - factor of emitting electrons , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the distribution functions of the emitting particles by parallel and perpendicular momenta , respectively , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the macdonald functions and angle @xmath47 defines the direction of maximum intensity of the polarized component on the plane of sky . according to @xcite the following condition is fulfilled for the resonant particles : @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the mean value of the pitch angle ) . in this case",
    ", the emitting particles distribution function by their pitch angles has the following form @xcite : @xmath50    synchrotron emission of a single electron is strongly beamed along the direction of motion into an angle of order @xmath51 .",
    "hence , in the given direction , the observer will detect radiation of the electrons with velocities filling up the cone with @xmath51 in angular size and with the major axis coincided with the line of sight of an observer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , at the given moment of time , the observer receives emission of the electrons having the pitch - angles from the interval @xmath52 $ ] ( it should be mentioned that the angle @xmath41 is considered to be positive if @xmath53 and to be negative , otherwise ) .",
    "the stokes parameter @xmath54 is an odd function of variable @xmath41 , therefore , its integration over symmetric interval yields zero .",
    "let us consider the top view of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the larger circle represents a cross section of the cone .",
    "the lateral surface of this cone is described by the electron velocity vector moving on a spiral along the magnetic field line . the circle with smaller radius corresponds to the cone combined by the velocity vectors giving the significant radiation in the observer s direction . its angular size estimates as @xmath51 .",
    "the area of the smaller circle is striped in two different ways : area @xmath55 corresponds to the electrons which have positive values of angle @xmath41 , while area @xmath56 corresponds to those having negative values of angle @xmath41 . as these areas are not equal to each other",
    ", one would expect the nonzero value of @xmath54 . but bearing in mind that the bigger circle is large enough in comparison with the smaller one ( the solid angles of corresponding cones are of the order of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the beam electrons and , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the tail electrons , respectively ) , one can easily assume that @xmath61 .",
    "but only symmetry of integration bounds is not enough condition to have a zero circular polarization .",
    "also the distribution function by pitch angles , containing the variable @xmath41 , should change very slowly within the small interval @xmath62 .",
    "the estimations show that the latter condition is well fulfilled .",
    "thus , we conclude that the emission of this source is not circularly polarized .",
    "* corresponds to the magnetic field line and point * * a * * - to the observer s line of sight .",
    ", width=4 ]    now we can calculate the degree for the linear polarization , which writes as @xcite : @xmath63 the degree of linear polarization , corresponding to the energy interval ( @xmath64)kev of the observed x - ray spectrum can be calculated using eqs . ( 2 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "we get @xmath65 for the energies from the given interval .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the measured x - ray spectrum at relatively low frequencies @xmath27kev is produced due to synchrotron self - absorption process , of the beam electrons with the distribution @xmath66 .",
    "the degree of linear polarization in this case is defined as follows : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the calculations give @xmath69 .",
    "so , in the energy interval ( @xmath70kev ) , the degree of linear polarization of the x - ray emission undergoes the strong drop .",
    "the observed optical spectrum is the result of the synchrotron emission of tail electrons , redistributed due to quasi - linear diffusion : @xmath71 the degree of polarization of the optical emission yields @xmath72 , in this case .",
    "in previous works @xcite the plasma emission model of rxj1856 is presented .",
    "it is supposed that the emission of this source is generated by the synchrotron mechanism .",
    "the distribution function of relativistic particles is one dimensional at the pulsar surface , but plasma with anisotropic distribution function is unstable that can lead to a wave excitation .",
    "the main mechanism of wave generation in plasmas of the pulsar magnetosphere is the cyclotron instability . during the quasi - linear stage of the instability ,",
    "a diffusion of particles arises as along , also across the magnetic field lines .",
    "therefore , plasma particles acquire transverse momenta and , as a result , the synchrotron mechanism is switched on .",
    "the measured x - ray and optical spectra are the results of the synchrotron emission of primary - beam and tail electrons , respectively .",
    "the predictable characteristic frequencies @xmath73hz and @xmath74hz ( where @xmath75 is the frequency of maximum in synchrotron emission spectrum ) enter the same domains as the measured spectra .",
    "the original waves , excited during the cyclotron resonance , come in the radio domain , but the radio emission is not observed from rxj1856 .",
    "one of the possible explanations why the radio emission is not detected from this object is that it traverses a large distance in the pulsar magnetosphere ( since the model of a nearly aligned rotator is used ) .",
    "so there is a high probability for the excited waves to come in the cyclotron damping range : @xmath76 @xcite . in this case , the radio emission will not reach an observer . nevertheless , the detection of radio emission from rxj1856 would be a strong argument in favour of the model .",
    "the effectiveness of the cyclotron mechanism has been estimated and it appears to be quite efficient . for effective generation of waves",
    "it is essential that the time during which the particles give energy to waves should be more than @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 is the growth rate of instability ) .",
    "generated radio waves propagate practically in straight lines , whereas the dipolar magnetic field lines deviate from its initial direction , and the angle @xmath79 grows .",
    "@xmath80 is the angle between the wave line and the line of dipole magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", the resonance condition ( 1 ) imposes limitations on @xmath80 i.e. particles can resonate with the waves propagating in a limited range of angles .",
    "the estimations show that the following condition @xmath81 cm should be fulfilled .",
    "as the instability develops at the distances @xmath20 cm , it follows that the excited waves lie in the resonant region long enough for particles to acquire pitch angles and generate the observed radiation .",
    "the total energy available for the conversion into pulsar emission has been estimated , which approximately equals to @xmath82 . here , @xmath83 is the goldreich - julian density at the pulsar surface and @xmath84 is the radius of the polar cap .",
    "the estimations show @xmath85erg / s , which is enough to explain the observed x - ray luminosity of rxj1856 .",
    "the recently discovered @xmath86s pulsations of the x - ray emission of rxj1856 has been explained in the framework of drift wave driven model .",
    "the main feature of this model is that the spin period of pulsar might differ from the observable period ( for rxj1856 the real spin period is estimated to be @xmath1s ) , as a consequence of the existence of very low frequency drift waves in the region of generation of the pulsar emission .",
    "these particular waves are not detected but only result in a periodical change of curvature of the magnetic field lines , which in turn cause the change of observed radiation with a period of the drift wave .    in the present paper the emission polarization of rx j1856.5 - 3754",
    "is investigated , as we suppose that the measurement of the polarization properties of rxj1856 will make clear its real emission nature .",
    "it was shown that both the x - ray and optical emissions are linearly polarized .",
    "the degrees of polarization for the x - ray emission approximately equals @xmath69 in the energy interval of @xmath87kev and @xmath65 in the energy interval of @xmath88kev .",
    "the calculation of degree of polarization for optical emission yields @xmath72 .",
    "if the emission of this source has a thermal nature then according to @xcite ( this model , among other thermal emission models , gives the best match of the entire spectrum ) the polarization of x - ray emission should essentially be equal to @xmath89 .",
    "but if the emission of this source is generated by the synchrotron mechanism , it is expected that both the x - ray and the optical emissions will be linearly polarized with the frequency dependent polarization degrees , giving the values from a few percents up to @xmath90 .",
