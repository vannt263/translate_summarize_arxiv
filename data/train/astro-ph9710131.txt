    "using monte - carlo simulations , we showed that our fitted parameters were unbiased .",
    "we also studied systematic errors due to an imperfect knowledge of the leakage covariance matrix .",
    "unfortunately , a theoretical knowledge of fitting data is not enough as only real data will teach us if our approach is correct .",
    "contrary to fitting p - mode power spectra , the process of fitting the fourier spectra as described in part i is rather difficult to understand and visualize . schou ( 1992 )",
    "gave a few diagnostics for understanding how the fourier spectra are fitted but without showing an easy way to visualize the covariance matrices .",
    "in this paper , we show how one can easily visualize the mode and noise correlation matrices , and then derive the mode leakage matrix . in the first section ,",
    "we describe 4 new diagrammes that have various diagnostics power . in the second section ,",
    "we describe how we use those diagrammes for inferring the leakage and noise covariance matrices for the data of the luminosity oscillations imager ( loi ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) data ( appourchaux et al , 1997 ) , and for the data of the global oscillations network group ( gong ) ( hill et al , 1996 ) .",

    "the echelle diagramme was first introduced by grec ( 1981 ) .",
    "it is based on the fact that the low - degree modes are essentially equidistant in frequency for a given @xmath9 ; the typical spacing for @xmath3 is 136 @xmath2hz .",
    "the spectrum is cut into pieces of 136 @xmath2hz which are stacked on top of each other .",
    "since the modes are not truly equidistant in frequency , the echelle diagramme shows up power as distorted ridges ; an example is given in fig .",
    "[ echelle ] for the loi / soho instrument seeing the sun as a star .",
    "another useful diagramme was introduced by brown ( 1985 ) , the so - called @xmath0 diagramme which shows how the frequency of an @xmath10 mode depends upon @xmath11 .",
    "most often this diagramme is only shown for a single @xmath12 and for intermediate degrees @xmath13 .",
    "the purpose of these diagrammes is always to show an estimate of the variance of the spectra . in our case",
    "we also want to visualize not only the variance but also the covariance of the fourier spectra . here",
    "we briefly recall from part i that the observed fourier spectra ( @xmath14 ) can be related to the individual fourier spectra of the normal modes ( @xmath15 ) by the leakage matrix @xmath16 by : @xmath17 the covariance matrix @xmath18 of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , can be derived from the sub - matrix @xmath21 whose elements can be expressed as : @xmath22=\\nonumber\\\\ 2 \\sum_{l\" = l , l'}\\sum_{m \"=- l\"}^{m\" = l \" } \\tens{\\cal{c}}_{m',m\"}^{(l',l \" ) } \\tens{\\cal{c}}_{m , m\"}^{(l , l\")*}f_{m\"}^{l''}(\\nu)+2\\tens{\\cal{b}}_{m , m'}^{(l , l ' ) } \\label{imp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the expectation , @xmath24 is the profile of the @xmath25 mode , @xmath26 is the covariance matrix of the noise , and with the @xmath27 having a mean of zero .",
    "the factor 2 comes from the fact that the real part of @xmath21 represents both the covariance of the real or imaginary parts of the fourier spectra ( see part i , section 3.3.2 ) ; the same property applied to the imaginary part of @xmath21 which represents the covariance between the real part and the imaginary part of the fourier spectra .",
    "equation ( [ imp ] ) contains all the information that we need for visualizing an estimate of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath21 .",
    "drawing from the usefulness of the diagrammes of grec and brown , we created four new diagrammes for visualizing an estimate of @xmath21 , all having various diagnostics power :    1 .",

    "ratio cross spectrum : estimate of the ratio of the elements of @xmath26    each diagnostic is described hereafter in more detail .",
    "the _ @xmath0 echelle diagramme _ is made of @xmath31 echelle diagrammes of each @xmath10 power spectra or @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath31 echelle diagrammes are stacked on top of each other to show the dependence of the mode frequency upon @xmath11 .",
    "these diagrammes give an estimate of the diagonal of the covariance matrix of the observations as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 symbolizes the estimate of @xmath28 .",
    "it is important when one makes these diagrammes to tune the spacing for the degree to study .",
    "the spacing for a given @xmath9 can be computed from available p - mode frequencies .",
    "since the spacing varies with the degree , other modes with a significant different spacing can be seen more like diagonal ridges crossing the @xmath0 diagrammes ; this is a powerful tool to identify other degrees .",
    "nevertheless , the diagnostics power of the @xmath35 echelle diagramme is rather limited for deriving the leakage matrix : it can be shown using eq .",

    "( [ imp3 ] ) , the sign information of the elements of @xmath37 is lost ; second , their magnitude being typically less than 0.5 , the leakage elements can not be easily seen in the power spectra .",
    "another kind of diagramme that preserves the sign of the leakage elements had to be devised .",
    "the _ cross echelle diagramme _ of an @xmath10 mode is made of @xmath31 echelle diagrammes of the cross spectrum of @xmath11 and @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath31 real ( or imaginary ) parts of the cross spectra are stacked on top of each other to show the dependence upon @xmath11 of the mode frequency .",
    "these diagrammes give an estimate of the rows ( or columns ) of the covariance matrix of the observations as : @xmath40 of course when @xmath41 we get the echelle diagrammes of the previous section .",
    "only @xmath42 cross echelle diagrammes are shown as the matrix @xmath21 is hermitian by definition .",
    "the imaginary part of the cross spectra has some diagnostic power : it represents the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of the fourier spectra .",
    "when the leakage matrix is real , which is generally the case , there is no correlation between the real and imaginary parts .",
    "nevertheless the imaginary part could be helpful to find errors in the filters applied to the images ( see part i , section 3.3.1 ) .",
    "it can be shown that the elements of @xmath28 can be expressed as : @xmath43 as we can see with eq .",
    "( [ imp1 ] ) , these diagrammes preserve the sign of the leakage matrix elements . in general , the cross spectra for @xmath44 , representing @xmath45 carries information over the sign of the leakage elements @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the other additional terms expressed as product of leakage elements are sometimes more difficult to interpret .    but the power of these diagrammes is not only restricted to checking the sign of the elements of the leakage matrix .",
    "they are also real tools to get a first order estimate of the leakage matrix .",
    "we have shown in part i , that there is no difference between fitting data for which the leakage matrix _ is _ the identity , and data for which the leakage matrix is _",

    "this is the most powerful test for deriving the leakage matrices .",
    "the cross echelle diagrammes are useful to verify the correlation within a given degree , but other degrees are known to leak into the target degree , such as @xmath50 , 7 and 8 into @xmath5 , 4 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the purpose of the next diagramme is to assess the magnitude of these leakages .",
    "the _ inter echelle diagramme _ of an @xmath10 mode for the degree @xmath51 is made of @xmath52 echelle diagrammes of the cross spectrum of @xmath10 and @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath52 real part of the cross spectra are stacked on top of each other to show the dependence upon @xmath38 .",
    "these diagrammes give an estimate of the rows ( or columns ) of the covariance matrix of the observations as : @xmath55 similarly as for the cross echelle diagramme , it will help to visualize the covariance matrix between different degrees , and to derive leakage elements of the full leakage matrix @xmath16 .",
    "one can derive an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ imp1 ] ) for different degrees showing that the inter echelle diagramme carries information over the sign of the leakage elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "as mentioned above applying the inverse of the leakage matrix will help to verify to the first order that there is no artificial correlation due to the p modes .",
    "when different degrees are involved the full leakage matrix @xmath16 has to be used , producing diagrammes that should have no artificial correlation due to the p modes .",
    "all the previous diagrammes are helpful to understand and visualize the mode covariance matrices .",
    "unfortunately , due to the high signal - to - noise ratio , these diagrammes can not be used to evaluate the correlation of the noise in the fourier spectra . in between the p modes",
    ", these correlations can be more easily visualized as we have : @xmath58 but instead of visualizing @xmath26 , we prefer to look directly at the correlation by computing the ratio of the cross spectra as : @xmath59 this ratio is called the _ ratio cross spectrum_. the ratio cross spectrum gives an estimate of the ratio matrix @xmath60 ( see part i ) which gives a better understanding of how much the noise background is correlated between the fou - rier spectra .",
    "nevertheless , in the p - mode frequency range , the ratio cross spectrum is more difficult to interpret as the noise correlation is affected by the presence of the modes . by looking away from the modes ( at high or low frequency ) or by looking between the modes",
    ", one could obtain a reasonable good estimate of the noise correlation .",
    "example of these diagrammes can be seen in figs .",

    "for example , one can see in fig .",
    "[ mnuloi1 ] that the ridges of power of @xmath62 and 3 have different shapes than in fig .",
    "[ mnuloi2 ] .",

    "this kind of ` anti'-splitting behaviour is typical of any aliasing degrees .",
    "it is more prominent in the loi data because of the undersampling effect due to the large size of the loi pixels .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      before using the other diagrammes on real data , we need to point out a very important property coming from the way the @xmath11 signals are built .",
    "if the weights @xmath68 applied to the images , to extract an @xmath10 mode , have the same properties as of the spherical harmonics then we have : @xmath69 which means that both the fourier spectra of @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be obtained from using a single filter @xmath72 .",
    "the fourier spectrum of @xmath70 will be in the positive part of the frequency range , while that of @xmath71 will be in the negative part .",
    "this approach was first used by rhodes ( 1979 ) for measuring solar rotation , and mentioned theoretically by appourchaux and andersen ( 1990 ) for the case of the loi . due to the property of the fourier transform , we recover , in the negative part of the frequency range , _ not _ the fourier spectrum of @xmath71 but its _",
    "conjugate_. this fact is very important , if one does not take care of the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath71 , it will lead to very serious problem . needless to say that fitting data without taking into account this detail will have devastating effects .",
    "figure [ error2 ] shows 2 cross echelle diagrammes for the real and imaginary parts of the spectra of @xmath4 ; the latter part had no sign compensation for @xmath73 .",
    "obviously this important detail can not be detected in the power spectra .        according to theoretical computation of the p - mode sensitivities of the loi pixels ( appourchaux and andersen , 1990 ) and using the real shape of the loi pixels ( appourchaux and telljohann , 1996 ) , the leakage matrices of @xmath5 and 2",

    "the leakage matrix of @xmath8 is given in table [ c55 ] .",
    "these leakage matrices are mean value over one year .",
    "the leakages vary throughout the year because the distance between soho and the sun varies .",
    "there is no @xmath79 angle effect as the mean @xmath79 is zero over 1 year .",
    "all the leakage elements are real as the loi filters have the same symmetry as the spherical harmonics .",

    "figures [ year1 ] and [ year2 ] show how the artificial correlations ( or @xmath11 leaks ) can be removed from the loi data ; for the latter we also cleaned the original data from the presence of the @xmath3 modes .",
    "we shall see later on with the gong data that cleaning , similar to that of the loi , can be achieved not only for 2 degrees but also for 3 degrees ( @xmath80 and 9 ) .    unfortunately , the leakage matrix of @xmath8 for the loi data can not be inverted .",
    "this is the result of the pixel undersampling and has two dramatic consequences : the leakage matrix can not be verified as for the @xmath4 , and fitting the data as described in part i is not valid anymore as the leakage matrix needs to be invertible .",
    "it means that the @xmath31 fourier spectra of @xmath8 are dependent .",
    "one way around the problem is to restrict the fitting to truly independent fourier spectra .",
    "this problem is specific to the loi data and applies only for @xmath81 .",
    "the leakage matrices of the gong data have been computed by r.howe ( 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "we also computed similar leakage matrices using the equations developed in part i. the integration was made in the @xmath82 plane with @xmath83 without apodization .",
    "we also took into account the effect of subtracting the velocity of the sun seen as a star which affects gong instrument s sensitivity to modes only detected by integrated sunlight instrument ( mainly the modes for which @xmath84 is even ) .",
    "the theoretical leakage matrices of @xmath5 and 2 for gong are also given by eq .",
    "( [ leakageloi ] ) but with : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . for @xmath5 ,",

    "the leakage between @xmath90 and @xmath91 has about the same value as for the loi ; these modes are not affected by the subtraction .",
    "the cross echelle diagrammes of the @xmath4 gong data are very close to those of the loi ( see fig .",
    "[ cross2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ gong2 ] shows an example of a gong cross echelle diagramme after having applied the inverse of the leakage matrix .",
    "it is clear that the p - mode correlations are removed .",
    "for @xmath5 we have used the cross echelle diagramme of @xmath90 and @xmath92 for inferring quantitatively the off - diagonal leakage element @xmath93 .",
    "we first applied the inverse of a leakage matrix to the @xmath5 data , and then constructed the cross echelle diagramme of @xmath90 and @xmath94 for these data .",
    "we then collapsed this diagramme by adding up all the modes with @xmath95 , and finally we corrected the collapsed diagramme from the solar noise background .",

    "when the corrected surface is close to 0 , there is no artificial correlation remaining .    cleaning",
    "the data from artificial correlations has also been done in a different way by toutain ( 1998 ) .",
    "using singular value decomposition , they recomputed pixel filters for the mdi / loi proxy so as to remove the @xmath11 leaks and the other aliasing degrees . here",
    "we have shown , that data cleaning is also possible _ without _ having the pixel time series , but using the fourier spectra .",
    "this latter cleaning technique is more useful as one has to reduce a smaller amount of data .",
    "figures [ inter16 ] and [ inter58 ] shows the inter echelle diagramme for @xmath5 , @xmath97 , and @xmath8 , @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "these diagrammes are more difficult to interpret , but using specific spacing for @xmath9 or @xmath51 , one can unambiguously identify which degree contributes to the correlation . for the loi data , the @xmath8 and @xmath63 ( similarly @xmath7 and @xmath99 )",
    "are contaminated by each other .",
    "this is again due to the spatial undersampling which prevents the loi data to be cleaned from aliasing degrees making the leakage matrix not invertible .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath5 loi data are far less affected by the presence of @xmath50 compared with that of gong ( see in the next section ) ; this is the result of an effective apodization function ( limb darkening ) which creates a narrower spatial response than that of gong ( line - of - sight projection ) .",
    "figure [ year2 ] has already shown that we could clean the @xmath4 loi data from the @xmath3 mode .",
    "this was done by taking into account the leakage matrix @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately as mentioned for the @xmath8 , the loi data can not be cleaned from aliasing degrees because the leakage matrice @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are singular .",
    "figures [ gong16 ] and [ gong19 ] show the inter echelle diagramme for @xmath104 , and for @xmath105 .",
    "the correlations are clearly visible .",
    "if they are not taken into account they are likely to bias the frequency and splittings of the @xmath5 ( see rabello - soares and appourchaux , 1998 , in preparation ) . by using the inverse full leakage matrix of @xmath80 and 9 ( i.e. @xmath106 , one can clean the data from these spurious correlations arising both from the aliasing degrees and from the @xmath11 leaks .",

    "[ gong16 ] and [ gong19 ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations have been almost entirely removed .",
    "some correlations between the @xmath107 modes and the @xmath108 modes are still present .",
    "this is due to the fact that the computation of the leakage for @xmath109 are very sensitive to the subtraction of the velocity of the sun seen as a star .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath110 modes as they are insensitive to this effect .",
    "nevertheless , our imperfect knowledge of the leakage matrix can be adjusted in order to remove the residual correlations .",
    "it helped to reduce the systematic errors of the @xmath5 splitting at high frequencies , mainly where the @xmath50 start to cross over the @xmath5 ( rabello - soares and appourchaux 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is possible to apply this cleaning technique to higher degree modes ( @xmath111 . in principle , this is feasible , although the plethora of data involved may be fairly substantial . for higher degrees , the ridges of the modes in the @xmath0 echelle diagrammes are almost parallel to each other .",
    "the idea would be not to use the full fourier spectra , as we did for the low degree gong data , but to use only a small frequency range of about @xmath112 30 @xmath2hz around the target degree . by doing so",
    ", we will not only clean the data from the aliasing degrees but also from the @xmath11 leaks . in this case , the mode covariance matrix is diagonal .",
    "if we assume , wrongly , that the noise covariance matrix is diagonal , the statistics of each cleaned spectrum , for high degree modes , could be approximated by a @xmath113 with 2 degree of freedom . neglecting the off - diagonal elements of the noise covariance matrix will lead to larger mode linewidth , thereby producing underestimated splittings ; this systematic bias will decrease as the degree .",
    "this approximation will produce much less systematic errors than the approximation used by hill ( 1996 ) for the original data .",
    "the use of the suggested approximation for the gong data may help , at the same time , to reduce systematic errors , and to increase computing speed for higher degree modes .",
    "the degree where one needs to switch between this approximation and the correct analysis needs to be determined .",
    "the leakage and ratio matrices have similar properties ( see part i ) .",
    "for example , for a given @xmath9 there is no correlation between the @xmath11 for which @xmath114 is odd for either matrix .",
    "this lack of correlation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ratio1 ] for the ratio cross spectra of the loi data .",
    "the ratio matrix is also useful if one wants to reduce the number of noise parameters to be fitted .",
    "this is useful when the noise background , mainly of solar origin , varies slowly over the p - mode range . in this case",
    "the ratio can be assumed to be constant over the p - mode range .",
    "for example for @xmath5 we can fit 2 noise parameters instead of 3 .",
    "when the noise varies in the p - mode range , it is more advisable to fit as many noise parameters as required .",
    "figure [ ratio2 ] shows the ratio cross spectra of @xmath4 for the loi data .",
    "as this is commonly the case for the loi , the ratios are independent of frequency .",
    "in addition , as outlined in part i , the ratio matrix is very close to the leakage matrix . using the values of @xmath93 given for the loi in eq .",
    "( [ leakageloi ] ) and fig .",
    "[ ratio2 ] , one can see that this is the case for the loi .",
    "the ratio matrix has even the same symmetry property as the leakage matrix . in the case of the loi",
    ", we sometimes use the independence of the ratio with frequency to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "it is less straightforward to measure the noise correlation for the gong data than for the loi data .",
    "we recommend to measure it in between the p modes because that is what the fitting routines will determine .",
    "figures [ ratiog1 ] and [ ratiog2 ] show the ratio cross spectra of @xmath4 for the gong data .",
    "the ratio matrices ( as the leakage matrices ) are not symmetrical .",
    "apart from the @xmath5 , these matrices tend to be very close to those of the leakage matrices ( see previous section ) .",
    "it is also clear that the ratios depend upon frequency , probably due to the effect of mesogranulation affecting the spatial properties of the noise with frequency . in this case",
    ", we can not reduce the number of parameters to be fitted ( see rabello - soares and appourchaux 1998 , in preparation ) as we do for the loi .",
    "for helping the understanding of fitting p - mode fourier spectra , we have devised 4 new helioseismic diagnostics :    1 .",

    "the cross echelle diagramme helps verifying : * the sign of the imaginary parts of the fourier spectra for @xmath115 , * the sign of the elements of the leakage matrix of the degree @xmath9 , * to the first order the theoretical leakage matrix of the degree @xmath9 by applying the inverse of this matrix to the data ( i.e. cleaning the data from the @xmath11 leaks ) and * the cleaning of the data from @xmath11 leaks . 3 .",
    "the inter echelle diagramme helps verifying : * the sign of the elements of the full leakage matrix for degrees @xmath116 , * to the first order the theoretical leakage matrix of the degree @xmath116 by applying the inverse this matrix to the data and * the cleaning of the data from aliasing degrees .",
    "the ratio cross spectrum helps deriving : * the amplitude of the noise correlation between the fourier spectra and * the frequency dependence of the correlations .",
    "these steps will help to evaluate the matrices of the leakage , mode covariance , ratio and noise covariance directly from observations .",
    "the fitting of the p modes will be considerably eased by verifying that the theoretical knowledge of these matrices is correct .",
    "these steps have been used both on data for which we design the spatial filtering ( loi instrument ) , and on data for which we did not design the filtering ( gong ) . as a matter of fact",
    "these diagnostics are so powerful that a theoretical knowledge of the various matrices is not always necessary to understand the data .",
    "very often these diagnostics can also be used to find bugs in the data analysis routines ( fig .",
    "[ error2 ] ) . nevertheless , it is advisable to know to the first order the leakage and ratio matrices for speeding up the analysis process .",
    "last but not least , the knowledge of the leakage matrices can be used for cleaning the data from @xmath11 leaks and from undesired aliasing degrees .",
    "this cleaning can be performed either when the pixel time series are available ( mdi data , toutain , 1998 ) or more simply when only the fourier spectra are available ( loi , gong ) .",
    "the cleaning has very useful application for the gong velocity data for removing aliasing degrees from @xmath5 , 6 and 9 for instance , and for inferring better @xmath5 splittings ( rabello - soares and appourchaux 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "the cleaning is somewhat easier with fourier spectra as one does not need to reduce large amount of image time series .",
    "it is advisable that , in the near future , this cleaning technique be used for higher degree modes .",

    "<S> we introduce 4 new diagnostics in helioseismology : the @xmath0 echelle diagramme , the cross echelle diagramme , the inter echelle diagramme , and the ratio cross spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these diagnostics are extremely powerful to visualize and understand the covariance matrices of the fourier spectra , and also to find bugs in the data analysis code . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrammes can also be used to derive quantitative information on the mode leakage and noise covariance matrices . </S>",
    "<S> numerous examples using the loi / soho and gong data are given . </S>"
