    "understanding the initial formation and evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) within the early universe is a major goal of observational cosmology . while average parameters of the universe itself and the observed clustering of galaxies are well described by conclusions from microwave background anisotropies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the transformation from initial anisotropies to individual primordial galaxies during the first few billion years of the universe ( redshift z @xmath14 2 ) is not understood . when did the first galaxies assemble ? when did the first generation of stars occur",
    "? how did these enrich the interstellar medium with metals , molecules , and dust ? when and how did the massive black holes of agn develop ?",
    "observations available to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that these formation processes maximized at 2 @xmath15 z @xmath15 3 , both for agn and star formation ( hereinafter , we refer to luminous , star forming galaxies as `` starbursts '' ) . understanding that maximum and tracing the decline of agn and starbursts since that epoch provides fundamental insight on how these processes have evolved in the universe .",
    "the capabilities of the spitzer space telescope ( @xmath5 ) provide powerful and independent tools to address these issues , for several reasons .",
    "the most luminous galaxies known ( l@xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2l@xmath3 ) are the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , e.g. soifer et al .",
    "1986 , sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) , whose luminosity arises because obscuring dust reemits luminosity absorbed from shorter wavelengths . the total dust emission in the infrared from galaxies of all luminosities dominates the cosmic background luminosity , and this luminosity constrains the total number of galaxies and agn @xcite .",
    "the extreme extinction at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths makes it impossible in many cases to observe the primary luminosity sources for agn and starbursts . observing such objects in",
    "the infrared overcomes this severe extinction .",
    "furthermore , the wide wavelength range of the the infrared spectrograph on @xmath5 ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) makes it possible to trace the same diagnostic spectral features all the way from z = 0 to z @xmath13 3 .",
    "a variety of observing programs with @xmath5 have been dedicated to understanding the optically - faint populations of dusty extragalactic sources which are revealed in mid - infrared surveys at 24with the multiband imaging photometer for @xmath5 ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) and in near - infrared surveys with the @xmath5 infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "a major objective has been to understand sources discovered with very large infrared to optical ratios , typically having f@xmath9(24 ) @xmath1 1 mjy and @xmath16 @xmath1 24 mag .",
    "[ i.e. f@xmath9(24 ) /f@xmath9(r ) @xmath14 1000 ] .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the irs have shown that these dusty sources primarily fall into two categories : sources with strong absorption by the 9.7 silicate absorption feature , and sources with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both cases , the large infrared to optical ratios",
    "are attributed to obscuration by dust , which heavily extincts the rest frame visible and ultraviolet fluxes while producing the mid - infrared continuum through reemission .",
    "these heavily extincted sources have been termed `` dust obscured galaxies '' @xcite .",
    "sources with strong pah emission are attributed to starbursts , with the pah arising in the photodissociation region surrounding the ionized gas produced by the young , hot stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sources with little pah luminosity but strong silicate absorption are explained as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) surrounded by absorbing clouds of dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these clouds are identified primarily because of heavy absorption in the 9.7 silicate feature .",
    "dust associated with clouds in such agn can also be seen in silicate emission , if the continuum observed from the hotter dust is not observed through cooler dust which produces the absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we summarized results for the most luminous dusty starbursts with 0 @xmath4 z @xmath4 2.6 discovered by @xmath5 and observed with the irs . in the present paper , we present an analogous summary for the most luminous dusty agn . because these agn are often at z @xmath13 2 , are highly luminous , and are spatially unresolved in infrared or ground - based optical observations , they are often called quasars .",
    "we use the term agn because imaging of some examples with the hubble space telescope shows that they have a surrounding , spatially extended component @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we trace the evolution of both obscured and unobscured agn from z = 0 to z = 2.8 using a single spectral diagnostic [ @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) ] , determine the comparisons of their total infrared luminosities l@xmath0 to @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) , and compare the agn to analogous results for starbursts .",
    "we also predict the f@xmath9(24 ) for agn and starbursts that would be observed to z = 6 based on average spectra of the most luminous examples of each class .",
    "hundreds of irs spectra of agn are now available within the @xmath5 archive , ranging from systematic observations of previously known , nearby agn to discovery observations of sources with z @xmath1 2 . in this paper",
    ", we assemble data from 20 different @xmath5 programs to summarize a wide variety of agn , including 115 heavily obscured sources classified by having strong absorption in the 9.7 silicate feature , and 60 unobscured sources ( type 1 agn ) as classified by silicate emission .",
    "most high redshift agn discovered with @xmath5 and with redshifts measured by the irs are obscured sources with significant silicate absorption .",
    "this is primarily a selection effect , because the presence of strong silicate absorption provides an unambiguous spectral feature for a redshift measurement .",
    "by contrast , agn with no silicate absorption appear essentially as power law spectra and can not be assigned a redshift based on the irs spectrum .",
    "our summary is intended to present an overview of a wide range of sources with irs spectra which satisfy criteria of being agn , either heavily obscured or unobscured .",
    "all agn which have been observed with @xmath5 are not included , especially lower luminosity , local objects .",
    "we attempt , however , to include all of the most luminous agn with irs spectra at all redshifts .",
    "the primary selection criteria are designed to locate `` pure '' agn , both heavily obscured and unobscured , and to distinguish them from sources having their mid - infrared luminosity arising primarily from starbursts .",
    "most of the new sources initially discovered by @xmath5 and having irs followup spectra are at z @xmath13 2 , typically with f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) @xmath14 1 mjy . the signal to noise ( s / n ) of such spectra is low , so it is important to have measurement criteria which are easily applied to such faint sources . in figure 1 , we illustrate examples of rest - frame spectra ( with artificially high s / n ) for the brightest sources which have been observed at z @xmath13 2.5 , scaled to flux densities actually observed for the brightest examples published so far .",
    "( these are source 90 in table 1 ( below ) for the most luminous absorbed agn , source 37 in table 2 ( below ) for the most luminous type 1 agn , and source mips 506 @xcite for the most luminous starburst . )",
    "the shape of the average spectrum shown for type 1 agn derives from the averages of the two most luminous quasars in @xcite , which are also sources 37 and 49 in table 2 .",
    "the shape of the average spectrum of the absorbed agn is the average of the three luminous ulirgs discussed below in section 3.2 and shown in figure 5 .",
    "the shape of the average spectrum of the most luminous starbursts is the average of the four most luminous starbursts in @xcite .    in our previous discussion of starbursts with such redshifts @xcite , we measured luminosity using the peak flux density of the 7.7 @xmath7 m pah emission feature .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , this is the observed peak of the spectrum for starburst sources at z @xmath14 2 .",
    "a similar peak at @xmath13 8 arises in obscured agn for a very different reason , which is the heavy silicate absorption longward of this wavelength and the heavy absorption by ices shortward of this wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the flux density f@xmath9(8 ) of this apparent continuum peak at @xmath13 8 is the best measure of luminosity of an absorbed agn at redshifts z @xmath13 2 .",
    "the precise rest - frame wavelength of this localized peak can range from about 7.7 to 8 , depending on the characteristics of the absorption .",
    "although we refer to this as the 8 peak , measurements that we report are the maximum flux density at @xmath13 8 , regardless of the precise wavelength .",
    "it is essential to distinguish agn and starbursts among the faint sources discovered and observed with @xmath5 . comparing spectra for the absorbed agn and",
    "the starburst in figure 1 indicates the importance of the pah features at 6.2 and 8.6 for judging whether the peak at @xmath13 8 is dominated by pah 7.7 emission or by the dust continuum of an absorbed agn .",
    "various previous studies and summaries indicate that a `` pure '' starburst has rest frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the 6.2 feature greater than 0.4 , but that sources with ew(6.2 ) @xmath4 0.1 have their mid - infrared continuum dominated by agn luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are many intermediate cases in which both starbursts and agn contribute to the mid - infrared luminosity ; dividing such composites into agn and starburst components is done primarily using the ew of the pah features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for individual objects , determining the relative agn and starburst contributions is important . in our studies , however , both for starbursts as done previously and for the agn in the present paper , we attempt to avoid uncertainties regarding composite sources by concentrating only on sources that appear either as pure starbursts ( very strong pah ) or as pure agn ( very weak pah ) .",
    "this is an empirical approach , designed to make best use of the numerous spectra of poor s / n .",
    "it also allows a straightforward discussion of the luminosities of agn or of starbursts , without introducing model - dependent uncertainties arising from different methods of deconvolving composite sources .",
    "the criterion which we adopt for including sources in the present paper as agn is that sources have a measured value of ew(6.2 ) @xmath4 0.1 , or that no detection is reported for the 6.2 feature .",
    "the type 1 agn included in this paper are all classified using available optical spectra , so there is no ambiguity regarding the presence of an agn .",
    "the obscured sources suffer severe extinction in the optical , however , so optical spectra , even when available , would not necessarily reveal an obscured agn . our definition of obscured agn states that in the absence of the pah features from starbursts , the infrared spectrum arises from dust reradiation of luminosity initially produced by an agn .",
    "for a source so hidden that no spectral diagnostics can escape , it is never possible to disprove the possibility that some of the luminosity arises from hidden starbursts .",
    "there are numerous reasons to believe , however , that sources characterised by strong silicate absorption and weak pah emission show a spectrum which arises from dust heated by an agn and which is then absorbed by intervening , cooler dust .",
    "the first source for which silicate absorption was observed was the prototype seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 , for which the continuum of heated dust arises from a region surrounding the agn which is even smaller than the narrow line region @xcite .",
    "as @xmath5 irs spectra accumulated , it was found that type 2 ( optically absorbed ) agn characteristically show silicate absorption , whereas type 1 ( optically transparent ) agn typically show silicate emission @xcite , reinforcing the association between silicate absorption and obscured agn .",
    "the most thoroughly observed obscured ulirg is markarian 231 .",
    "this ulirg unambiguously contains a type 1 agn , immersed in heavy clouds that produce absorption in x - ray , ultraviolet , and visible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "half of the continuum is absorbed by the silicate absorption at 9.7 , so that the optical depth @xmath6 of the absorption feature is @xmath6 = 0.7 @xcite . in selecting `` obscured agn '' , we use a criterion that assures sufficiently significant absorption that the source can be recognized in any irs spectrum that includes the rest - frame feature .",
    "our criterion requires that @xmath6 @xmath1 0.7 , so markarian 23l defines the lower limit of absorption for obscured agn which we include in the present paper .",
    "@xcite use measures of relative absorption in the 9.7 and 18 silicate features to show from radiative transfer arguments that the heavily absorbed ulirgs require a concentrated source of dust heating , which arises naturally for an agn but not for distributed starbursts . coupled with the weak pah features in such sources ,",
    "they conclude that these absorbed ulirgs are dominated by agn luminosity .",
    "when the overall spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of the absorbed sources discovered by @xmath5 are examined , there is a distinct relation between the sed and the presence of strong silicate absorption .",
    "the absorbed sources show power law seds from mid - infrared through optical wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , selection of sources which show the stellar absorption feature at rest frame 1.6 invariably yields sources with pah emission @xcite . for large samples of @xmath5 sources having photometry that determines the sed",
    ", the power law seds correlate with the presence of x - ray luminosity , leading to the conclusion that these power law sources are agn @xcite .    for all of the above reasons , we feel it is appropriate to interpret the sources with deep silicate absorption and weak pah emission as having the mid - infrared continuum arising because of an agn .",
    "as emphasized in section 2.1.1 , we attempt to avoid the uncertainty of agn+starburst composite sources by using only sources with with quantitatively weak pah features .",
    "this produces a sample of sources which can be considered as the `` purest '' absorbed agn , and it is this sample which is discussed below .",
    "absorbed sources are chosen from various @xmath5 observing programs as those sources with irs spectra which show @xmath6 @xmath1 0.7 for the 9.7 silicate absorption feature and ew(6.2 ) @xmath4 0.1 for the 6.2 pah emission feature .",
    "emission sources are chosen from various programs as those sources with 9.7 silicate emission of any strength and ew(6.2 ) @xmath4 0.1 for the pah emission feature .",
    "we have not attempted to include a comprehensive list of low luminosity , local agn observed with @xmath5 because our objective is to locate the most luminous sources distributed over the largest possible redshift range .",

    "our only use of the spectra for these silicate emission sources with optical redshifts is to measure the rest frame @xmath8l@xmath9(8 ) .",
    "this measurement is listed in table 2 , so these new silicate emission spectra are not illustrated .",
    "we first present a description of the redshift dependence on luminosity for all of the agn , obscured and unobscured , using the data in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "this analysis is analogous to our similar analysis of the most luminous starbursts @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the measure of luminosity is a consistent spectral feature ( 7.7 pah for starbursts or 8 continuum for agn ) which can be traced over all redshifts 0 @xmath4 z @xmath15 2.8 using observations with the irs .",
    "using a single spectral feature allows the straightforward comparison of sources over this full redshift range .      for the obscured agn characterized by silicate absorption ,",
    "the distribution of dust continuum luminosities with redshift is shown in figure 3 .",
    "because the irs spectra allow redshift determinations for agn at high redshift having strong silicate absorption , and because many iras ulirgs at low redshift are obscured agn , there is a good distribution of these obscured agn over all redshifts 0 @xmath4 z @xmath15 2.8 ( triangles and crosses in figure 3 ) .",
    "we quantitatively determine the form of evolution for the most luminous obscured agn within this sample .",
    "the form of this luminosity evolution as a function of redshift is obtained by using the most luminous source in each interval of 0.02 in log(1+z ) .",

    "the sample of unobscured , silicate emission , type 1 agn discovered with irs observations of @xmath5 sources is much smaller than the sample of obscured agn because the irs can not obtain an unambiguous redshift for sources with broad or weak silicate emission features . the unobscured , silicate emission , type 1 agn from table 2 are plotted in figure 4 , but we do not attempt a fit to their luminosity evolution because the redshift intervals are so sparsely sampled",
    ". the distribution of points indicates , however , that their form of evolution is similar to that for the obscured agn in figure 3 .",
    "trends are offset because of the systematically higher luminosities of the unobscured agn , discussed further below in section 3.5 .",
    "the distribution of the silicate emission agn in figure 3 matches the form of luminosity evolution for type 1 agn in the bootes field initially discovered as @xmath5 24 sources and subsequently found to have optical redshifts and type 1 classifications @xcite . using a sample of 183 sources with f@xmath9(24 ) @xmath1 1 mjy and optical redshifts 1 @xmath4 z @xmath4 5 , @xcite determine that pure luminosity evolution fits the results with evolution of the form log l(z ) = log l(z=0 ) + 1.15z - 0.34z@xmath21 + 0.03z@xmath22 .",
    "this evolution curve is shown in figure 3 as a dashed curve , normalized to the brightest unobscured agn which has been observed in bootes with the irs .",

    "the @xcite function maximizes at z = 2.5 .",
    "brown et al . emphasize that this evolution agrees with that found for type 1 quasars discovered optically , as in @xcite .",
    "the demonstrated similarity in evolution of both obscured and unobscured agn is one of our most important results .",
    "it is one source of evidence , with more discussed below , that there are no fundamental , intrinsic differences among the most luminous agn despite the very differing spectral signatures which divide obscured and unobscured agn .",
    "another important result of the analysis above is that the evolution factor of ( 1+z)@xmath10 for obscured agn agrees with that determined for the most luminous starbursts @xcite .",
    "the form of evolution is determined the same way in both cases , taking the most luminuous source in each interval 0.02 of log ( 1+z ) and extending to z = 2.6 . in both cases ,",
    "the most luminous sources were located within a variety of @xmath5 spectroscopic programs , and a single spectral diagnostic was used to trace luminosities over all redshifts from 0 to 2.6 .    for starbursts ,",
    "the parameter which was used in @xcite to measure evolution is the luminosity @xmath8l@xmath9 ( 7.7 @xmath7 m ) for the 7.7 pah emission feature associated with starbursts .",
    "this luminosity relates to the star formation rate ( sfr ) for starbursts , so luminosity evolution also represents evolution in the maximum sfr , which was found to scale as log(sfr ) = 2.1(@xmath120.3 ) + 2.5(@xmath120.3 ) log(1+z ) , for sfr in m@xmath3 yr@xmath23 .",
    "we note also that the form of evolution we derive for obscured and unobscured agn and for starbursts is the same within the uncertainties as found for optically - luminous galaxies .",
    "the comprehensive summary by @xcite of evolution parameters derived from optical and radio constraints shows evolution going as ( 1+z)@xmath24 and being almost entirely luminosity evolution , with @xmath120.5 uncertainty in the exponent .",
    "the sources which we use to track agn evolution and starburst evolution are from completely different samples , each sample defined by the presence ( starburst ) or absence ( agn ) of the pah emission feature in the irs spectra .",
    "our observational result is that these two categories of luminous , dusty galaxies have evolved in the same way .",
    "the resulting similarity in evolution implies a close relationship between luminous agn and luminous starbursts .",
    "what is the nature of this relationship ?",
    "attempts to understand the local ulirgs resulted in the suggestion that the starburst and agn phenomena in luminous , dusty galaxies occur in the same galaxy but at different times @xcite . in a simple summary of this scenario ,",
    "a starburst is triggered by the inflow of a new supply of molecular gas caused by a galactic interaction or merger .",
    "some of the gas reaches the central massive black hole and causes an increase in its luminosity , but the agn is not seen until the radiation from the agn dissipates the surrounding gas and dust , which may also quench the starburst .",
    "a similar scenario has been suggested for the extremely luminous , dust obscured galaxies at high redshift , including those in the present paper @xcite . in this case , contrasted to the local ulirgs , the molecular material is collecting about a primordial galaxy in the process of formation .",
    "that the luminous agn and starburst populations track each other so closely in luminosity evolution does not require , however , that either phenomena causes the other . if both luminous agn and luminous starbursts arise because of galactic interactions or other events which supply fresh gas and dust into the gravitational potential of a galaxy , both can be triggered by the same event .",
    "this triggering does not require that the agn affects the starburst , or that the starburst affects the agn ; they can be coincidental in the same galaxy because a galactic interaction stimulates both .",
    "whatever the process , these @xmath5 irs results show that energizing sources for dusty ulirgs , whether starburst or agn , have declined together through the past 11 billion years , as the typical luminosity has faded by a factor of @xmath13 20 .",
    "one exception should be noted to the similarities described above among the evolution of both categories of agn and of starbursts . for starbursts and unobscured ( type 1 ) agn",
    ", there are no sources with z @xmath4 0.5 having luminosities comparable to the most luminous sources with z @xmath1 2 .",
    "there is a distinctive difference for the most luminous , obscured agn .",
    "the three most luminous , obscured ulirgs in figure 3 , all with z @xmath4 0.6 , are systematically more luminous by a factor of @xmath13 3 than other local ulirgs and come within a factor of 3 of the most luminous absorbed agn found anywhere in the universe .",
    "the rest - frame spectra of these three sources ( all discovered by iras ) are shown in figure 5 , labeled by the running numbers in table 2 .",
    "the spectra illustrate that all of these are deeply absorbed , so that the high luminosities",
    "@xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) arise despite extinction that may decrease the apparent 8 @xmath7 m luminosities .",
    "the weakness of the 6.2 pah feature is evidence that the high luminosities at 8 do not arise from a starburst component that enhances the apparent 8 @xmath7 m luminosity with 7.7 pah emission .",
    "the spectra in figure 5 also show how silicate absorption @xmath14 8 @xmath7 m and absorption by ices @xmath15 8 @xmath7 m produces a localized continuum peak at @xmath13 8 @xmath7 m .",
    "the average shape of these spectra shown in figure 1 is very similar to the spectra of the most luminous absorbed agn at z @xmath13 2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for luminous starbursts and unobscured agn ,",
    "luminosity evolution can be explained by a systematic change in the amount of gas that falls deep within the potential well of the galaxy ; unobscured agn luminosity is controlled by the fraction of this gas that approaches the central massive black hole , and starburst luminosity is controlled by the total amount of gas in the circumnuclear molecular clouds . as a consequence , the luminosity evolution of type 1 agn and of starbursts both is the result of having decreasing amounts of accreting material at lower redshifts .    for the luminous , obscured agn , the presence of three low redshift sources which depart from the systematic trend indicates that there may be an additional factor other than the amount of accreted material which sometimes controls the luminosity @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) of these sources .",
    "it is notable , however , that the unusually high luminosities of these 3 sources when measured by @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) are not so unusual when measured by total infrared luminosity l@xmath0 .",
    "the 2 iras ulirgs in figure 5 have measures of l@xmath0 ( sources 3 and 32 , excluding the fsc source ) , and the ratio l@xmath0/@xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the 2 unusually luminous ulirgs have distinctly small values for this ratio , indicating that they are more similar to other ulirgs when measured in l@xmath0 .    one possible explanation for the unusually large @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) and unusually small ratio l@xmath0/@xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m )",
    "may be the location and distribution of the absorbing dust clouds .",
    "absorbing clouds concentrated unusually close to the agn could give rise to warmer dust and preferential emission at shorter wavelengths , compared to sources with cooler , more distant clouds .",
    "we can consistently interpret our general results for both obscured and unobscured agn in context of the simple `` unified model '' ( section 3.5 , below ) containing a dusty , absorbing torus with comparable opening angles in all agn .",
    "these three sources indicate , however , that this model becomes more complex for the most heavily absorbed sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , we determine the form of luminosity evolution in section 3.1.1 . for obscured sources without including these three anomalous sources .",
    "we have utilized @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) as a measure of continuum luminosity from emitting dust because of observational necessity ; this parameter is easily measured over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "of course , a more fundamental measurement is the total dust - emitted luminosity , l@xmath0 , which is dominated by luminosity arising at far - infrared wavelengths from dust that is cooler than the dust which produces the mid - infrared luminosity at 8 . for those bright sources which have total infrared observations with iras",
    ", we can determine the ratio l@xmath0/@xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) .",

    "pah sources dominate , however , in samples deliberately selected using near infrared irac colors to seek the redshifted 1.6 stellar absorption feature @xcite .",
    "more quantitative results comparing the numbers of agn and starbursts arise by classifying the spectral shapes of sources having mips and irac fluxes .",

    "extinction can be estimated under the simple assumption of an absorbing screen , using measurements of absorption @xmath6 at 9.7 and scaling to absorption by the same dust at 8 @xcite .",
    "there are two primary uncertainties with this approach .",

    "originally conceived to explain the differences between optical classification of type 1 agn and type 2 agn as arising only from orientation effects @xcite , the model can be applied to the infrared dust continuum . in this case , the observed @xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) depends on viewing angle . if absorbing clouds are viewed from the cool side , then l@xmath0/@xmath8l@xmath9(8 @xmath7 m ) is measured by the value for obscured sources .",

    "an independent estimate of the extinction at 8 arises by comparing the observed luminosities of obscured and unobscured agn , as in figures 1 and 4 .",

    "this result implies that @xmath13 40% of the intrinsic 8 luminosity emerges from the obscured sources .",
    "the presence of large amounts of dust within agn and starbursts in the early universe raises many questions .",

    "the 8 peak of the absorbed continuum is at @xmath13 29 , and the deepest absorption is at @xmath13 35 . for faint sources with poor s / n , these are approximately the reddest wavelengths for which absorbed sources can be confidently identified spectroscopically . a crucial question ,",
    "therefore , is whether the luminosity evolution observed to z = 2.6 continues beyond that redshift .",
    "even though infrared spectra for redshift measurements can not be obtained , we can ask whether such sources would exist within the @xmath5 mips surveys at 24 .",
    "this is done by using the results described above regarding the luminosities and evolution of these sources to predict the fluxes which would be observed at 24 as redshift increases .",
    "the results are shown in figure 10 .",
    "asterisks are the most luminous unobscured , type 1 agn , crosses are the most luminous absorbed agn , and diamonds are the most luminous starbursts , all scaled to the brightest known examples shown in figure 1 . for each set ,",
    "the upper curve shows expected f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) if source luminosities continue to scale as ( 1+z)@xmath31 to z = 6 , and the lower curve shows expected f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) if there is no luminosity evolution for z @xmath1 2.5 .",
    "( the latter is the result for type 1 agn by @xcite , who determine that the space density of luminous type 1 sources maximizes at z = 2.5 . )",
    "the horizontal line in figure 9 is the mips limit of f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) = 0.3 mjy for typical wide area surveys such as in bootes , the fls , and swire .",
    "( smaller area surveys have reached f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) @xmath4 0.1 mjy . )",
    "results in figure 10 show that even if luminosity evolution continues for z @xmath1 2.5 , we could not expect these mips surveys to identify starbursts with z @xmath1 3 .",
    "the rapid fading of starbursts arises in part because the strong pah 7.7 emission feature moves longward of the mips bandpass .",
    "@xmath5 studies are revealing large numbers of dusty starbursts with z @xmath4 3 by various survey techniques and irs follow up , and these studies should eventually lead to a well quantified measure of star formation densities for z @xmath4 3 . for now , tracking dust to earlier epochs must rely on agn .",
    "figure 10 shows that both obscured agn and unobscured ( type 1 ) agn should be found with f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) @xmath1 0.3 mjy to z @xmath13 6 , even without continued luminosity evolution for z @xmath1 2.5 .",
    "in fact , a number of type 1 agn have already been discovered using f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) in the bootes field at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "these are shown as squares in the figure .",
    "( redshifts are not published for the quasars in brown et al . , but redshifts and fluxes for sources are shown in figure 8 of that paper , and all sources with z @xmath1 3 are shown in figure 9 . ) that the f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) for all of these unobscured agn in figure 10 fall below the extrapolations from the brightest source at z = 2.5 is further evidence that the luminosity evolution of unobscured agn turns down for z @xmath1 2.5 , as already concluded from optical data .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the evidence for this turnover of luminosity evolution in figure 10 derives from the luminosity of the dust - emitting continuum .",
    "one possible suggestion for the maximal optimal luminosities of type 1 agn at z @xmath13 2.5 when observed in the rest - frame ultraviolet is that dust and extinction were less at that epoch .",
    "but the evidence of the present analysis is that dust luminosity for unobscured agn also shows a similar maximum , so the explanation for this maximum is not the absence of dust .",
    "it is crucial to find more high redshift examples of either category of agn , because these trace dust to the most distant epochs at which it can be detected .",
    "the presence of the two quasars in figure 9 from @xcite with z = 5.5 is evidence that dust existed when the universe was less than 1 billion years old",
    ".    it will be much more difficult to find obscured agn for z @xmath1 3 than to find the unobscured , type 1 agn .",
    "the obscured agn are much fainter optically than the unobscured agn ; based on the @xmath16 magnitudes of the obscured agn at z @xmath13 2.5 , we would expect @xmath16 @xmath14 25 .",
    "obscured agn with z @xmath1 3 may explain many of the sources having f@xmath9(24 @xmath7 m ) @xmath14 1 mjy and @xmath16 @xmath14 25 mag which show no features in the irs spectra @xcite .",
    "the best candidates for such sources are those objects with power law spectra in the mips and irac bands but optical magnitudes fainter than 25 . the only way to determine redshifts for these will be with optical and near - infrared spectroscopy , but this is challenging at such magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "that galaxy luminosities peak at z @xmath13 2.5 indicates that this epoch corresponds to a maximum for the assembly of massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the evolution of maximum sfr for starbursts to z = 2.5 reviewed in section 3.3 and the absence of starbursts with greater sfr at z @xmath1 2.5 discussed in section 3.6 indicate that the maximum sfr during the epoch 2.5 @xmath4 z @xmath4 6 is sfr @xmath15 3500 m@xmath3 yr@xmath23 . @xcite",

    "such a mass could accumulate within @xmath13 10@xmath33 yr .",
    "this conclusion indicates that starbursts at the luminosities we observe need have only short duration to explain the observed stellar masses of galaxies at z @xmath13 2.5 .",
    "we can also ask whether the necessary mass for the central massive black hole ( mbh ) presumed to power the accreting agn is consistent with the sfrs , as required if the remains of stars collect within the galactic nucleus to form the accreting mbh .",
    "many hst observations of local galaxies indicate a consistent and systematic result that every galaxy contains a central mbh with mass @xmath13 0.2% of the total virial mass of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( these authors suggest the term `` central massive object '' , or cmo , to allow a concentration of smaller black holes rather than a single mbh ) .    equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) indicate that the most luminous agn at z = 2.5 has l@xmath0 = 10@xmath34 l@xmath3 .",
    "if the eddington limit applies , 10@xmath35 ergs s@xmath23 is produced per solar mass of the accreting massive black hole ( mbh ) . in this case , the minimum accreting mass for the most luminous agn at z = 2.5 is then 3x10@xmath36 m@xmath3 .",
    "this number for the high redshift , dusty agn is the same as the most massive local cmo observed by hst , which is shown in @xcite to have a cmo mass of 3x10@xmath36 m@xmath3 .    using the 0.2% scaling of ferrarese et al .",
    ", this result for the most luminous agn indicates a required total virial mass of 1.5x10@xmath2 m@xmath3 for the most luminous obscured galaxies .",
    "if we assume that 90% of this virial mass is in the form of non - baryonic , dark matter , the required stellar mass is 1.5x10@xmath37 m@xmath3 , a number only 5 times larger than the median lower limit for the observed stellar masses in @xcite .",
    "starbursts at the maximum sfr of 3500 m@xmath3 yr@xmath23could accumulate this stellar mass in 5x10@xmath33 yr .",
    "our various conclusions regarding the luminosities and sfrs of the high redshift agn and starbursts discovered by @xmath5 are consistent , therefore , with the interpretation that these sources represent the most massive galaxies in the process of formation .",
    "results are also consistent with the interpretation that the central , compact massive objects which power agn were in place by the epoch when these galaxies had maximum luminosity .",
