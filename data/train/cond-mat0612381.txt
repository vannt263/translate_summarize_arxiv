    "in the human genome project ( from the year 1990 to 2003 ) sequences of chemical base pairs that make up human dna were intensively analyzed and determined , as it carries important genetic information .",
    "dna is a polymer made up of a large number of deoxyribonucleotides , each of which composed of a nitrogenous base , a sugar and one or more phosphate groups @xcite .",
    "similar ribonucleotides polymerize to form rna , which is also an important substance to produce a template for protein synthesis .",
    "rna sometimes carries genetic information but rarely shows enzymatic functions @xcite .",
    "one big issue of the post genome project is the proteomics since proteins play crucial roles in virtually all biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis , coordinated motion , mechanical support , etc .",
    "a protein is a long polymer of amino acids , and folds into regular structures to show its biological function .",
    "sugars and amino acids in these biological polymers contain carbon atoms , each of which is connected to four different groups , and consequently is able to take two kinds of stereostructures .",
    "the two stereoisomers are mirror images or enantiomers of each other , and are called the d- and l - isomers .",
    "two isomers should have the same physical properties except optical responses to polarized light .",
    "therefore , a simple symmetry argument leads to the conclusion that there are equal amount of d- and l - amino acids or sugars in life .",
    "but the standard biochemical textbook @xcite tells us that `` only l - amino acids are constituents of proteins '' ( @xcite , p.17 ) , and `` nearly all naturally occurring sugars belong to the d - series '' ( @xcite , p.346 ) .",
    "there is no explanation why the chiral symmetry is broken in life and how the homochirality has been brought about on earth .",
    "it is pasteur who first recognized the chiral symmetry breaking in life in the middle of the 19th century . by crystallizing optically inactive sodium anmonium racemates ,",
    "he separated two enantiomers of sodium ammonium tartrates with opposite optical activities by means of their asymmetric crystalline shapes @xcite .",
    "since the activity is observed even in the solution , it is concluded that the optical activity is due to the molecular asymmetry or chirality , not due to the crystalline symmetry . because two enantiomers with different chiralities are identical in every chemical and physical properties except the optical activity , `` artificial products have no molecular asymmetry '' and in 1860 pasteur stated that `` the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products '' establishes `` the only well - marked line of demarcation that can at present be drawn between the chemistry of dead matter and the chemistry of living matter '' @xcite . also by using the fact that asymmetric chemical agents react differently with two types of enantiomers , he separated enantiomers by fermentation",
    ". therefore , once one has an asymmetric substance , further separation of two enantiomers or even a production of a single type of enantiomer may follow @xcite . but how has the first asymmetric organic compound been chosen in a prebiotic world ?    this problem of the origin of homochirality in life has attracted attensions of many scientists in relation to the origin of life itself since the discovery of pasteur @xcite .",
    "japp expected a `` directive force '' when `` life first arose '' @xcite , and various `` directive forces '' are proposed later such as different intensities of circularly polarized light in a primordial era , adsorption on optically active crystals , or the parity breaking in the weak interaction .",
    "however , the expected degree of chiral asymmetry or the value of the enantiomeric excess ( ee ) turns out to be very small @xcite , and one needs a mechanism to amplify ee enormously to a level of homochirality .",
    "another scenario for the origin of homochirality was suggested by pearson @xcite such that the chance breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "though the mean number of right- and left - handed enantiomers are the same , there is nonzero probability of deviation from the equal populations of both enantiomers .",
    "the probability to establish homochirality in a macroscopic system is , of course , very small @xcite , but `` chance produces a slight majority of one type of '' enantiomers and `` asymmetric compounds when they have once arisen '' act as `` breeders , with a power of selecting of their own kind of asymmetry form '' @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "produced enantiomer acts as a chiral catalyst for the production of its own kind and hence this process should be autocatalytic .",
    "nearly a century later , a long sought autocatalytic system with spontaneous amplification of chiral asymmetry is found by soai and his coworkers @xcite : in a closed reactor with achiral substrates addition of a small amount of chiral products with a slight enantiomeric imbalance yields the final products with an overwhelmingly amplified ee @xcite .",
    "the autocatalytic system also shows significant ee amplification under a variety of organic and inorganic chiral initiators with a small enantiomeric imbalance @xcite .",
    "when many reaction runs are performed without chiral additives , about half of the runs end up with the majority of one enantiomer , and the other half end up with the opposite enantiomer .",
    "the probability distribution of the ee is bimodal with double peaks , showing amplification of ee and further indicating the occurrence of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .    as for the theoretical research on the chiral symmetry breaking , frank is the first to show that a linear autocatalysis with an antagonistic nonlinear chemical reaction can lead to homochirality @xcite .",
    "his formulation with rate equations corresponds to the mean - field analysis of the phase transition in nonequilibrium situation @xcite , and other variants have been proposed @xcite .",
    "all these analyses are carried out for open systems where the concentration of an achiral substrate is kept constant .",
    "asymptotically the system approaches a unique steady state @xcite or even an oscilatory state @xcite , independent of the initial condition .",
    "when the final state is chirally asymmetric , one may call this a chiral symmetry breaking in the sense of statistical mechanics , and it is indicated in the right upper corner in table 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the soai reaction is performed in a closed system and an achiral substrate is converted to chiral products irreversibly : the substrate concentration decreases in time , and eventually the reaction comes to a halt . after the reaction the ee value increases but its final value is found to depend on the initial state . even though the ee is amplified , the history dependent behavior is different from what we expect from phase transitions in statistical mechanics , so that we write down `` ee amplification '' in the left lower corner in table 1 .",
    "we have analyzed theoretically the chiral symmetry breaking in a closed system in general , and found that with an irreversible nonlinear autocatalysis the system may show ee amplification as in the soai reaction .",
    "furthermore , with an additional recycling back reaction , a unique final state with a finite ee value is found possible , which we call a chiral symmetry breaking as is shown in the right lower corner in table 1 @xcite .",
    "there are also many theoretical works on the soai reaction in a closed system @xcite . here",

    "if the nonlinear recycling exists as @xmath172 , @xmath4 becomes nonzero since @xmath173 .",
    "if the linear recycling exists as @xmath174 , not all the achiral substrate transform to chiral products but a finite amount remains asymptotically as @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , nonzero values of @xmath8 , @xmath11 or @xmath176 give contributions to the coefficients @xmath3 or @xmath4 .    for nonzero @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 , the velocity @xmath177 has three typical behaviors as a function of the order parameter @xmath33 , as shown in fig.[fig6 ] . in the region with a positive ( negative ) velocity @xmath160 , @xmath33 increases ( decreases ) and moves to the right ( left ) , as indicated by arrows on the @xmath33 axis in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "when @xmath3 is negative , as in fig.[fig6](a ) or ( b ) , @xmath33 eventually approaches the racemic value @xmath178 within its range of definition @xmath179 : the racemic state is a stable fixed point for @xmath180",
    ". equation ( [ eq43 ] ) tells us that this happens when the spontaneous production @xmath8 or error in a linear autocatalytic process @xmath11 are sufficiently strong , or quadratic catalysis @xmath82 is weaker than the cross catalysis @xmath87 .",
    "the coefficient of the linear autocatalysis @xmath9 as well as the linear recycling process @xmath152 are absent in the coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and can not affect directly the chirality of the system .",
    "these linear processes with @xmath9 and @xmath152 affect the chirality only implicitly through @xmath16 and @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath3 is positive , as in the case of fig.[fig6](c ) , the coefficient of the cubic term @xmath4 is also positive , and the velocity @xmath181 vanishes at three values of @xmath33 in the range of @xmath182 .",
    "this is possible if a strong quadratic autocatalysis @xmath183 exists together with a linear recycling @xmath174 , or if a linear autocatalysis @xmath9 and a nonlinear recycling @xmath184 coexist . by following the direction indicated by the arrows for positive @xmath33",
    ", the order parameter ends up at a definite value @xmath185 and the chiral symmetry breaking takes place . if the system starts with a negative @xmath33 , it stops at @xmath186 .",
    "the final state of the system depends on the initial sign of @xmath51 , but independent of its magnitude @xmath187 .",
    "we note that the asymptotic values of the coefficients @xmath188 and @xmath189 are independent of the initial condition and so is @xmath190 .",
    "this situation is what we mean the `` chiral symmetry breaking '' in the sense of statistical mechanics .",
    "we first discuss the chiral symmetry breaking when there is a nonlinear recycling , @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the rate eq.([eq42 ] ) tells us that @xmath191 is no more a fixed line , but we have many fixed points .",
    "the simplest is the case with only a linear autocatalysis @xmath192 but nothing else ( @xmath193 ) . in this case",
    "we have four fixed points in the @xmath44 phase space : two unstable ones , o and u , and two stable ones at @xmath194 or @xmath195 , as is shown in fig.[fig7](a ) . at the stable fixed points the final ee take values @xmath196 .",
    "these values agree with those expected from eq.([eq44 ] ) with @xmath197 as determined from eq.([eq43 ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear recycling ( 42 ) returns the same amount of enantiomers back to the achiral substrate , but the relative decrement in concentration is larger for the minority enantiomer than for the majority one .",
    "the damage is further amplified by a large reduction of linear autocatalytic effect for the minority enantiomer , and it disappears at last .     ) similar to the frank model , and ( b ) a quadratic autocatalysis and a linear recycling ( @xmath198 ) . ]    as for the second example , we consider the case with a quadratic autocatalysis @xmath199 and a linear recycling @xmath174 . because the linear recycling takes place whenever there is nonzero concentrations of enantiomers",
    ", a few achiral substrate always remain , @xmath200 .",
    "thus the diagonal line @xmath201 is no more a fixed line .",
    "instead there appear fixed points in general . in the present case with a finite @xmath174 ,",
    "totally seven fixed points appear ; three stable ( o , s@xmath202 ) and four unstable ones ( u@xmath203 ) , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] . as reaction proceeds ,",
    "the system approaches a state associated with one of the stable fixed points .",
    "the origin o is not interesting , since all the chiral products are recycled back to the achiral substrate .",
    "also its influence extends only in a small region around o , bounded by u@xmath204 , if the life time @xmath205 of chiral products is long enough .",
    "close to this fixed point , influence of the spontaneous production process with @xmath8 should be taken into account , anyhow .    when the initial system is sufficiently away from o , the system approaches s@xmath206 or s@xmath207 ; both correspond to homochiral states with @xmath196 . when the initial configuration is close to the racemic state or the diagonal line @xmath35 , the system approaches a racemic fixed point u@xmath208 at first .",
    "but , while the recycling process returns the chiral enantiomers back to achiral substrate , the majority enantiomer increases its population at the cost of the minority one along the flow curve diverging from u@xmath208 to s@xmath206 or to s@xmath207 , and eventually the whole system becomes homochiral .",
    "one may wonder whether recycling processes such as a linear or a nonlinear back reaction exist in relevant autocatalytic systems .",
    "so far , we are not aware of their existence .",
    "it is , however , possible that the back reaction rates @xmath152 or @xmath156 are nonzero but exceedingly small to be detected in laboratory experiments . concerning with the problem of homochirality in life , very small",
    "@xmath152 or @xmath156 are not unimaginable , considering the geological time scale for its establishment on earth .",
    "on the other hand , a possibility to provide a system with a recycling process is proposed theoretically @xcite : one simply let the reaction with ee amplification run in an open flow reactor . in an open system there is reactant flows between the system and the environment @xmath209 .",
    "let the solution with the achiral substrate @xmath3 be supplied by an inflow with an influx @xmath210 as @xmath211 and the products @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as the substrate @xmath3 be taken out by an outflow with a flow out rate @xmath152 as @xmath212 in terms of rate equations the processes are described as @xmath213a+f-\\lambda a .",
    "\\label{eq47}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the total concentration @xmath214 follows the time evolution @xmath215 , it approaches the steady state value @xmath216 with a relaxation time @xmath205 .",
    "this is a consequence of unbiased outflow ( [ eq47 ] ) of all reactants with the same rate @xmath152 .",
    "consequently , even though we are dealing with an open system under a flow , the analysis is similar to the closed system by replacing the total concentration @xmath81 with the steady state value @xmath216 . instead of recycling",
    ", therefore , constant supply of the substrate allows the system to reach a certain fixed point with a definite value of the order parameter @xmath33 , independent of the initial condition .",
    "we have presented various simple scenarios that we are aware of in relevance to the ee amplification of the soai reaction ; a quadratic autocatalytic model in a monomer or a homodimer system , or a linear autocatalytic model in an antagonistic heterodimer system .",
    "all these models can realize ee amplification such that the final value of the ee @xmath123 depends on but is larger than the initial value @xmath124 , as schematically shown in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "the curve in the figure represents @xmath217 relation for a given initial ratio @xmath126 , namely the ratio of the amount @xmath130 of the total chiral initiators @xmath0 and @xmath1 relative to that of the total reactants @xmath81 . amplification is more enhanced if the ratio of the chiral initiator @xmath126 is smaller .",
    "this plot also shows the possibility to increase the final ee by repeating the reaction .    to achieve high ee values , soai et al .",
    "performed experiments of consecutive autocatalytic reactions , where after each run of the reactions , resulting solutions are quenched by adding acid and purified and reused in the next reactions .",
    "how the high ee value is attained in this type of experimental procedures can be explained illustratively in fig.8 . by choosing a specified initial condition @xmath218",
    ", the autocatalytic reaction ends up giving a final ee as @xmath219 determined by the intersection between the vertical line starting from @xmath218 point and the round curve .",
    "the consecutive reaction starts with the purified products with the ee @xmath220 as the initial ee @xmath221 .",
    "this feature is illustrated by extending a horizontal line from @xmath222 on the round curve to the @xmath223 straight slope .",
    "this second reaction yields the ee value @xmath224 , which is determined by the intersection between the vertical line starting from @xmath225 point and the round curve . to repeat these procedures , the ee approaches rapidly the perfect @xmath226 with the speed depending on the curvature of the curve , which is determined by @xmath126",
    "this is a mechanism of ee amplification and consecutive autocatalytic reactions , in contrast with the chiral symmetry breaking in the sense of statistical mechanics , where the final ee is unique and is reached by a single procedure .    in all the cases considered",
    ", autocatalytic processes must be present , whether it be linear or nonlinear . to understand the actual mechanism of autocatalysis for the soai reaction , the identification of the process at a molecular level is necessary , but that is out of scope of the present review .",
    "we would like to point out another interesting feature , namely the spatial aspect of the reaction @xcite . in usual experiments , the reactor is stirred to keep the system homogeneous .",
    "if there is no stirring , inhomogeneous patterns may develop between domains of two enantiomers .",
    "analysis of these patterns may give some insight into the mechanism of reaction dynamics .",
    "let us imagine , for instance , a time evolution of patterns of chiral domains for diffusionless systems with ee amplification and with a chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in an initial stage chiral domains are nucleated randomly , and the domain pattern may look similar for both systems .",
    "after domains come in touch with each other , they behave differently : for a system with ee amplification , domain pattern freezes because there remains no achiral substrate for further reactions . on the other hand , for a system with the chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "neighboring domains compete with each other at domain boundaries to extend their own territories , and the domain pattern evolves to selection slowly . when diffusion or hydrodynamic flow effects are taken into account , the system with ee amplification simply homogenizes and the ee value shall be averaged out . for the system with the chiral symmetry breaking , these transport processes speed up the chirality selection and enhance the final value of ee @xcite .",
    "so far we have discussed the ee amplification by starting from an initial state with a finite enantiomeric imbalance , and the effect of spontaneous reaction is mostly neglected , @xmath134 . however , reaction experiments without adding chiral substances do produce chiral species @xcite , implying that the coefficient @xmath8 of the spontaneous reaction should be nonzero . in these experiments , it is found that values of the ee order parameter @xmath95 of many runs are distributed widely between @xmath43 and @xmath42 , and the probability distribution function has double peaks at positive and negative values of @xmath95 .",
    "there is a theoretical study on the asymptotic shape of probability distribution for nonautocatalytic and linearly autocatalytic systems with a specific initial condition of no chiral enantiomers @xcite .",
    "even though no ee amplification is expected in these cases , the probability distribution with a linear autocatalysis has symmetric double peaks at @xmath227 when @xmath8 is far smaller than @xmath9 ; @xmath228 with @xmath229 being the total number of all reactive chemical species , @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". this can be explained by the `` single - mother '' scenario for the realization of homochirality , as follows . from a completely achiral state ,",
    "one of the chiral molecule , say @xmath0 , is produced spontaneously and randomly after an average time @xmath230 .",
    "then , the second @xmath0 is produced by the autocatalytic process whereas for the production of the first @xmath1 molecule the spontaneous production is necessary .",
    "the waiting time for the second @xmath0 is shorter than that for the first @xmath1 by a factor about @xmath231 .",
    "if this factor is far smaller than @xmath232 , there is only a negligible chance for the production of @xmath1 enantiomer until all the achiral substrates turn into @xmath0 .",
    "all the chiral products are the descendants of the first mother @xmath0 produced by the autocatalysis , and no second mother is born by the spontaneous production : this is a single - mother scenario .",
    "it strongly reflects the stochastic character of the chemical reaction , and is not contained in the average description using rate equations .",
    "further studies are necessary as for the stochastic aspects of the soai reaction @xcite .    in relation to the origin of homochirality in life ,",
    "an interesting question is whether the ee amplification is sufficient to achieve homochirality . from the experimental results of the soai reaction without chiral initiator ,",
    "the magnitude of the final ee @xmath123 is distributed from a small value to a value close to unity .",
    "it is rather difficult to imagine that a value close to unity has been accidentally selected on various places on earth in the prebiotic era .",
    "it seems rather natural that chiral symmetry breaking took place and a unique value of @xmath233 has been finally selected . as has been discussed in the previous section , the flow in the open system can alter the system with ee amplification to the one with the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "so we may say that the system with ee amplification in an open flow is one possibility .",
    "recently , there appears several theoretical proposals such as polymerization models @xcite or a polymerization - epimerization model @xcite to realize the chirality selection in polymer synthesis .",
    "although we are still far away from satisfactory understanding of the origin of homochirality in life , the discovery of the autocatalytic reaction by soai gives us great impetus and a sense of reality to this problem ."
