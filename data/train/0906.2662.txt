    "measuring photon statistics is a useful approach to understand the behavior of any system that includes electromagnetic radiation as a part .",
    "the investigation of such systems may pertain to physics , from astronomy to physics of the matter @xcite , as well as to other natural sciences , for instance biology @xcite .",
    "the availability of photon - counting detectors and methods suitable for any situation as to spectral and intensity characteristics of the light to be measured would then be extremely desirable .",
    "the coverage of the most different spectral ranges is a goal that is pursued by the search of novel primary photo - detection processes , including thermal processes occurring at cryogenic temperatures . among the detectors that operate , in essence , as microcalorimeters we mention a superconducting transition - edge sensor ( tes ) with tungsten as the active device material that was recently demonstrated to work as a photon - counter endowed with almost unitary quantum efficiency from uv - vis to telecom wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , we recognize that detectors based on quantum interactions between photons and sensitive material are largely more used than thermal detectors for measuring photon statistics .",
    "detectors based on either external primary processes ( _ e.g. _ electron photo - emission ) or internal primary processes ( _ e.g. _ photo - generation of carriers by either photo - voltaic or photo - conductive effects ) ensure reasonable values of the detection quantum efficiency , @xmath0 in the visible and near - ir spectral ranges .",
    "the main difficulty that still remains with these detectors is that of measuring photon statistics when the charges photo - generated in the samples are too many to be counted . among photoemissive detectors",
    "only few produce distinct outputs when the number of photo - electrons , @xmath1 , changes by a unit .",
    "the best ones are photomultiplier tubes ( pmt s ) @xcite and hybrid photo - detectors ( hpd s ) @xcite that can count up to @xmath2 .",
    "relatively more numerous are the photo - emissive detectors that are endowed with sufficiently high and sharp gain to provide a sizeable charge in the anodic pulse output for @xmath3 definitely distinguished from that for @xmath4 .",
    "they are pmt s available since the 50 s that were used for the first measurements of light statistics @xcite . nowadays",
    "single - photon detectors exist that are based on the most different primary photo - detection processes and offer a remedy to the lack of good photon counters .",
    "in fact , the light to be measured can be split either in space or in time prior to detection so that at most one photon at a time hits the detector sensitive area .",
    "however it must be recognized that these techniques invented for counting photons with intensified ccd cameras @xcite and multi - pixel and/or position sensitive single - photon detectors @xcite ( spatial splitting ) or single - photon avalanche photodiodes ( temporal splitting ) @xcite are rather cumbersome .",
    "their adoption is only justified by the impossibility of performing direct measurements with photon counters when the number of detected photons becomes macroscopic .",
    "the work described here concerns the direct measurement of the detected - photon statistical distribution , @xmath5 , and is motivated by the fact that , in many of the systems for which measuring photon statistics is relevant , artificially lowering @xmath1 is not permitted either by attenuating the light or by shortening the measuring time , @xmath6 .",
    "this is the case of fields that modify their properties upon attenuation and , obviously , of pulse fields in which @xmath6 can not be shorter than the light pulse duration .",
    "it is worth noting that measuring photon statistics when @xmath3 in @xmath6 is a problem that has been faced since the 60 s .",
    "in particular arecchi _",
    "_ @xcite suggested a `` linear method '' in which the pmt anodic charge corresponding to the photons detected in @xmath6 was recorded .",
    "moreover these authors demonstrated that calculating the moments of the statistical distribution of this charge and those of the single - electron response ( ser ) distribution allows obtaining the moments of @xmath5 .",
    "such a result has been used to verify the agreement with the theoretical @xmath5 moments up to second order @xcite . however , using it to recover @xmath5 would be at least cumbersome owing to the need of accurate evaluations of ser distribution moments at any order .",
    "we will show that any detector based on either an internal or an external primary photo - detection process and endowed with two properties rather commonly encountered , allow measuring @xmath5 in a macroscopic realm in which photon - counters do not exist .",
    "the two properties are : ( i ) the detector response must be linear up to the maximum @xmath1 of the measurement ; ( ii ) the response for @xmath7 must produce a standard deviation of the output data that is sufficiently smaller than the mean value .",
    "we further specify that the detector can be endowed with an internal gain .",
    "with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we first examine how the detector output is processed in a typical direct statistical measurement . normally it is amplified and integrated over a temporal gate , whose duration fixes the value of the measure time @xmath6 when a continuous wave light is to be measured . in the case of pulsed light ,",
    "the gate is synchronous and covers the @xmath6 interval in which the current output pulse of the detector occurs .",
    "the signal is sampled and digitized afterward and converted to a voltage @xmath8 .",
    "as indicated in the figure , we represent the overall @xmath1-to-@xmath8 conversion by a single factor , @xmath9 . here",
    "we will explicitly take into account the statistical distribution of the probability density @xmath10 of this conversion factor . the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] illustrates the link between the probability density of detecting @xmath1 photons , @xmath5 , and that , @xmath11 , of having @xmath12 photons in the field .",
    "considering the effects of the optics that delivers the light to the detector and of the detector quantum efficiency @xmath13 and representing these concomitant losses by an overall photon - detection efficiency , @xmath14 , lead to @xcite @xmath15 obviously in any experiment the value of @xmath14 is up - limited by the product of @xmath0 times the coupling efficiency of the optical delivery system , but can be diminished at will if filters are inserted into the system that delivers the light to the detector .",
    "we point out that , as we deal with direct statistical measurements , neither the delivery optics includes a fiber looping beam splitter nor the detector is a position sensitive one .",
    "our aim is to recover @xmath5 for an arbitrary @xmath11 starting from the only experimental data available , which are the @xmath8 voltage values recorded for an ensemble of measurements performed with given @xmath14 by using an apparatus characterized by a conversion factor @xmath9 with probability distribution @xmath10 , mean value @xmath16 and variance @xmath17 . in the following we indicate by @xmath18 the probability density of the @xmath8 variable .",
    "we assess that we can `` measure '' @xmath18 as the distribution that we would obtain by casting the experimental @xmath8 values of an ensemble of measurements into a histogram normalized to its integral .",
    "for ease of writing we represent the bin width by @xmath19 , though the variable @xmath8 is our digitized output .",
    "the zero of the @xmath8 scale of the `` measured '' @xmath18 is set to be equal to the mean value of the distribution recorded in a separate experiment performed in the absence of light .",
    "as the events of having different values of detected photons ( i.e. elementary charges generated by the primary photo detection process ) are mutually exclusive we can write @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is defined as the probability density of the voltage values @xmath22 that are recorded in the events with @xmath23 detected photons . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pv ] ) , @xmath24 is the probability distribution measured in the absence of light , for which we remind that @xmath25 .",
    "we note that @xmath18 obviously reproduces @xmath5 if the measuring apparatus has photon - counting capability @xcite whereas , when the @xmath21 s do not lead to separate peaks in @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pv ] ) seems to be useless to reconstruct @xmath5 .",
    "the latter is exactly the case examined in this paper .",
    "we consider the central moments @xmath26 corresponding to the experimental @xmath18 and try to relate them to the @xmath27 central moments corresponding to the unknown @xmath5 probability density . by using properties of the @xmath21 distributions to express @xmath28",
    ", we will find relations to @xmath29 that provide a method to reconstruct @xmath5 .",
    "as @xmath30 can be identified with the probability distribution @xmath10 of the conversion factor @xmath9 , we obviously have @xmath31 .",
    "owing to the hypothesis that the detector response is linear , detecting @xmath32 elementary charges corresponds to the occurrence of independent events , thus @xmath33 , in which all @xmath34 are distributed according to @xmath10 , and @xmath35 for @xmath23 times .",
    "thus we can exploit the following property of the cumulants @xcite : @xmath36 by reminding that the lowest order cumulants are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath41 , for the cumulants of the conversion / amplification factor we find : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , being @xmath47 the values assumed for the central moments of @xmath10 .",
    "we start by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumul ] ) with @xmath48 and then eq .  ( [ eq : pv ] )",
    "to calculate the mean value of @xmath8 : @xmath49 we now calculate the @xmath28 moments by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : pv ] ) : @xmath50 where we used @xmath51 .    for @xmath48",
    "( [ eq : muv ] ) obviously vanishes .",
    "for @xmath52 we make use of the binomial expansion @xmath53 which , once substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : muv ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vaver ] ) , gives @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muv2 ] ) the `` prime '' distinguishes the moments from the central moments .",
    "the recursion formula that relates the moments to the cumulants @xcite in our case reads @xmath55 from which it can be shown that the @xmath56-th order moment , @xmath57 , is a polynomial of the first @xmath56 cumulants , @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "thus in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muvprime ] ) : @xmath60 where the coefficients of the different terms are those that occur in the fa di bruno s formula . by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumul ] ) we can rewrite these terms in the form @xmath61 in which @xmath23 is the number of detected photons , each one converted with its own @xmath34 ( @xmath62 ) , and the cumulants are those of the probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "we observe that each term contains a product of cumulants in which the sum of the indices is the order of the moment .",
    "let us assume a narrow @xmath10 distribution so that @xmath63 .",
    "in terms of cumulants this rewrites @xmath64 $ ] . under this hypothesis",
    "also @xmath65 , that is @xmath66 $ ] , as we can write @xmath67 , where the first factor is the ( finite ) coefficient of skewness of the distribution @xmath10 .",
    "actually it can be easily shown that @xmath68 $ ] relations hold for any @xmath69 , if @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "taking into account that the number of detected photons , @xmath23 , is a finite number , all the monomials in the above expressions of the moments are negligible with respect to the last one , so that we can approximate @xmath70 . by substituting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muv2 ] ) we get @xmath71 note that , as @xmath29 never vanishes , even in the case of light in a single - mode fock state because of the non unit quantum efficiency of the detectors , actually eq .",
    "( [ eq : muv3 ] ) holds for measurements performed on optical fields with any statistics .    dividing both members of eq .",
    "( [ eq : muv3 ] ) by @xmath72 yields @xmath73 while the exact results for @xmath74 and @xmath75 would be @xmath76\\label{eq : mu2final}\\\\   \\frac{\\mu_3(v)}{\\langle v\\rangle } & = & \\bar{\\gamma}^2 \\left[\\frac{\\mu_3(m)}{\\langle m\\rangle}+3\\frac{\\mu_2(m)}{\\langle m\\rangle}\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\bar{\\gamma}^2 } + \\frac{\\tilde{\\mu}_3}{\\bar{\\gamma}^3}\\right]\\ , \\label{eq : mu3final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "we thus assess that , when detector and processing electronics ensure a sufficiently small ratio @xmath77 , the scaling law in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muvfinal ] ) holds and the simple knowledge of @xmath16 allows reconstructing @xmath5 .",
    "in fact binning the @xmath8 data of a measurement into bins of width @xmath16 produces a distribution @xmath18 identical to @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively we can say that @xmath5 is recovered by dividing the @xmath8 data by @xmath16 and then rebinning the new values into unitary bins .    how to determine @xmath16 when",
    "@xmath78 has been already shown @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that , for a detector simply endowed with linear response , we can both determine @xmath16 and decide on the negligibility of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath16 .    at this point , for the first time in this work , we make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phel ] ) .",
    "such a link between the @xmath5 and @xmath11 distributions gives @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus we find @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83/\\langle n\\rangle$ ] is the mandel parameter of the light entering the experimental apparatus in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and containing @xmath84 photons in the @xmath85 time interval @xcite .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : fanom ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : muvfinal ] ) and taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : vaver ] ) yield @xmath86 in which @xmath87 is independent of @xmath14 . on the other hand , @xmath72 depends on @xmath14 , which can be changed by acting on the light delivery optics : @xmath14 can be set at any value between the product of @xmath0 times the coupling efficiency of the optical delivery system and zero by adding filter into the system that delivers the light to the detector .",
    "thus by repeated measurements of the same light at different @xmath14 , we can verify the linear dependence on @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fanov ] ) .",
    "the experimental @xmath89 data plotted as a function of @xmath72 should align along a straight line , whose intercept reduces to @xmath16 if @xmath90 .",
    "knowing @xmath16 allows proceeding to the rebinning of the @xmath8 data that leads to the reconstruction of @xmath5 .",
    "experimental applications to some non - trivial classical states are described in references @xcite .",
    "the assessment that an experimental apparatus has a @xmath77 ratio sufficiently small for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : muvfinal ] ) deserves some comments , owing to the difficulty of knowing @xmath16 and @xmath79 separately .",
    "we first observe that for any photo - emissive detector @xmath79 decreases at increasing the strength of the electric field experienced by the photoelectrons as soon as they leave the cathode . for a pmt in which the internal gain is provided by multi - dynode cascade amplification , increasing the voltage difference between cathode and first dynode produces smaller @xmath79 values . for pmt s in which the electron amplification is provided by other structures ( _ e.g. _ micro - channel - plate , metal channels , etc .",
    ") , the same effect is obtained by acting on the voltage of the accelerating electrode . for a hpd , in which the electrons released by the photocathode are multiplied by a reverse biased avalanche diode ,",
    "@xmath79 is lowered by applying greater negative high voltages to the photocathode .    in the case of pmt s , modifying the voltage partition to change @xmath79 brings about a change in @xmath16 that can not be easily compensated by acting on the overall voltage applied between anode and cathode . in the case of hpd s",
    "this compensation is feasible by adjusting the avalanche diode reverse bias voltage .",
    "however in any electronic apparatus that processes the detector output there is a step that allows changing @xmath16 by a known factor ( _ e.g. _ in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : both ampl gain and adc scale ) while keeping @xmath77 virtually constant .",
    "the expression of the intercept in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fanov ] ) is such that , upon changing @xmath16 by a known factor but not @xmath77 , a new series of measurements at different @xmath14 values would provide a new evaluation of the intercept , whose value should scale by the same factor . on the contrary , for constant @xmath16 and different @xmath77 ratios ,",
    "the intercept should change differently .",
    "note that a check of the constancy of @xmath16 is provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vaver ] ) in which @xmath79 does not appear . if , by manipulating the voltages supplied to pmt / hpd detectors as described to change @xmath79 , we achieve a situation of constant and minimum intercept , we have proved that @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fanov ] ) .",
    "we can thus use this limit value of the intercept as the correct @xmath16 to rebin the experimental @xmath18 distribution and reconstruct @xmath5 . if the @xmath91 value provided by the reconstructed @xmath5 fits eq .",
    "( [ eq : vaver ] ) , it means that the detector guarantees a @xmath92 not only much smaller than one but small enough for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : muvfinal ] ) .",
    "we finally note that the above described verifications of the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : muvfinal ] ) are self - consistent in that they do not require measuring @xmath10 to establish the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath93 .",
    "this is a definite advantage with respect to any potential method for @xmath5 reconstruction based on the determination of the @xmath10 moments @xcite .",
    "we have shown that for any linear detector we can both measure @xmath16 and determine if @xmath77 is sufficiently small for taking as reliable the @xmath5 reconstruction achieved by binning the experimental @xmath8 values into bins of width @xmath16 . for the method to work it",
    "is necessary that the @xmath1-range where @xmath5 is non - negligible falls within the linearity range of the apparatus , which must be broad enough for a satisfactory verification of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fanov ] ) . in forthcoming papers",
    "we will show that our method works not only with hpd s @xcite and the burle 8850 pmt @xcite , but also with detectors such as si multi - pixel photon detectors @xcite . and more pmt s endowed with single photon sensitivity .",
    "useful detectors might also be solid state detectors such as avalanche photodiodes in the linear amplification regime @xcite . by the way ,",
    "some photon - number resolution is being demonstrated for these detectors , in particular if connected to charge - integration readout circuits with sufficiently low noise @xcite . at last , for a thermal detector such as a tes , obtaining a @xmath79 value sufficiently smaller than @xmath16 would be a minimal performance as compared to the excellent photon - number resolving power demonstrated by lita _",
    "@xcite up to 7 detected photons and might allow using a less sophisticated apparatus .",
    "we think that the results described in this paper will broaden the choice of detectors suitable for measuring photon statistics .",
    "the essential requirement for the detector , beside that of the linearity of the response , is the smallness of the ratio @xmath92 , which can be ascertained ( see above ) without measuring @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that the method applies to measurements in the macroscopic realm may turn out to be relevant in all cases in which one can not attenuate the light to bring the photon detection rate down to the regime where photon - counters operate . as examples we mention fields produced by events either rare or unstable and , more importantly , all nonclassical fields , where our method risks being the only one applicable to macroscopic fields .",
