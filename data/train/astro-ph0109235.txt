    "hr 1099 is a triple system and consists of a close double - lined spectroscopic pair with a spotted and rapidly rotating k1iv primary and a comparably inactive and slowly rotating g5v secondary in a @xmath5 orbit .",
    "the terciary is a fainter k3v star @xmath6 away .",
    "the system hr 1099 is one of the few rs cvn systems , along with ux ari , ii peg , and dm uma , that shows h@xmath0 consistently in emission .",
    "its tidally induced rapid rotation , combined with the deepened convection zone of a post main sequence envelope , is responsible for the very high chromospheric activity for its spectral class .",
    "the primary ( k1iv ) shows very strong and variable caii h & k and h@xmath0 emission that is indicative of high chromospheric activity .",
    "a comparison of the close binary with evolutionary models suggests that mass transfer from the k primary onto the g secondary may begin within @xmath7 years ( fekel 1983 ) .",
    "following previous musicos campaigns on hr 1099 ( foing et al .",
    "1994 ) the main goals of this campaign were to monitor for flares and to observe chromospheric lines in order to diagnose the energetics and velocity dynamics .",
    "also photospheric doppler imaging and the study of chromospheric activity variations were planned .",
    "the spectroscopic observations have been obtained during the musicos 1998 campaign ( nov - dec ) , using both echelle and long slit spectrographs . the sites and instruments involved in the campaign and some of their most important characteristics",
    "are shown in table  1 .",
    "the spectra have been extracted using the standard reduction procedures in the iraf package .",
    "the wavelength calibration was obtained by taking spectra of a th - ar lamp .",
    "the spectra have been normalized by a low - order polynomial fit to the observed continuum .",
    "finally , for the spectra affected by water lines , a telluric correction have been made .",

    "phase coverage , line coverage , wavelength coverage and sites involved in the musicos 1998 campaign are shown in fig  [ figcoverage ] . from the sites involved in the campaign",
    "we can conclude that hr 1099 was observed almost continuously during the campaign , approximately 3 weeks .",
    "sample spectral of hr 1099 showing the chromospheric lines , namely , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , d@xmath3 , d@xmath4 , at different phases are presented in fig  [ figsample ] ( top panel ) . during the campaign",
    "two flares were observed , one at jd 2451145.513 ( 28 - 11 - 98 ) and a second flare at jd 2451151.066 ( 03 - 12 - 98 ) .",
    "this second flare shows an increase in the h@xmath0 emission line , d@xmath4 line turns into emission during the flare and it also shows a strong filling - in of the d@xmath2 , d@xmath3 line ( see bottom fig  [ figsample ] ) .    in the top panel of fig  [ figequiwidth ] we show the equivalent width as a function of julian date and as a function of phase for several chromospheric lines . from these results we observed that , although both flares shown an increase in h@xmath0 emission , the second flare produced a bigger increase .",
    "we have also observed that the first flare shows filling - in of h@xmath1 but for the second flare this line turns into emission .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the d@xmath2 , d@xmath3 lines have a strong filling - in during the second flare .",
    "note that both flares took place at around the same phase ( 0.85 ) , but @xmath86 days apart .",
    "note also that we have detected rotational modulation of the d@xmath4 line that could be attributed to the pumping of the hei line by coronal x - rays from active regions .    in the middle panel of fig  [ figequiwidth ]",
    "we plot the radial velocity curves of the binary system hr 1099 , calculated using photospheric lines .",
    "we have also plotted the radial velocity for the two monitored flares , calculated using h@xmath0 . as a result",
    ", we notice that during both flares , the radial velocity is slightly displaced ( 15 - 20 @xmath9 ) compared to the center of gravity of the primary",
    ". this result could be due to the fact that both flares had taken place near the limb .",
    "the bottom panel of fig  [ figequiwidth ] shows the @xmath10 ratio as a function of julian date and as a function of phase . during quiescent",
    "we obtained values around 1 for the @xmath10 ratio , while during the first flare we obtained values slightly bigger than in the quiescent ( 2 - 3 ) . during the second flare the ratio even reach values of 8 .",
    "we have observed the binary system hr 1099 continuously for more than seven orbits in the optical spectral range ( at high spectral resolution over a wide wavelength domain ) and we have also monitored two flares , one of which lasted more than one day .",
    "we wish to thanks those that have contributed to the musicos 1998 campaign .",
