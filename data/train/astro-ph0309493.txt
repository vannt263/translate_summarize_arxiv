    "coronal seismology became an efficient new tool that uses standing mhd waves and oscillations as a tool to explore the physical parameters of the solar corona .",
    "there are three basic branches of solutions of the dispersion relation for propagating and standing mhd waves : the slow mode branch ( with acoustic phase speeds ) , the fast mode branch and the alfvn branch ( with alfvnic phase speeds ) .",
    "furthermore , each branch has a symmetric and asymmetric solution , termed the sausage and kink mode ( roberts et al .",
    "all of these mhd oscillation modes have been now detected with imaging observations in recent years : transverse fast kink - mode oscillations with trace ( aschwanden et al . 1999 ; nakariakov et al .",
    "1999 ) ; longitudinal ( slow - magnetoacoustic ) modes with sumer ( wang et al . 2002 ; ofman & wang 2002 ) , and fast sausage - mode oscillations probably with the _ nobeyama radioheliograph _ ( asai et al . 2001 ; melnikov , reznikova , & shibasaki 2002 ) .",
    "the latter type of fast sausage - mode oscillations is the least established one , although numerous non - imaging radio observations exist that have been interpreted earlier in terms of this mode .",
    "however , a recent study by nakariakov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) pointed out that the dispersion relation and oscillation period has been incorrectly applied to the data , because the highly dispersive nature of the phase speed and the long - wavelength cutoff in the wave number has been ignored . here",
    "we revisit the relevant earlier radio observations in the light of these new insights and attempt to derive the correct physical parameters .",
    "the dispersion relation for magnetosonic waves in cylindrical magnetic flux tubes has infinitely many types of long - wavelength solutions in the fast - mode branch ( @xmath3 ) , with the lowest ones called sausage modes ( @xmath4 ) and kink modes ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the solutions are depicted in fig .  1 , showing that the kink mode solution extends all the way to the long - wavelength limit @xmath6 , while the sausage mode has a cutoff at a phase speed of v@xmath7v@xmath8 , which has no solution for small wave numbers @xmath9 .",
    "the propagation cutoff for the sausage mode occurs at the cutoff wave number @xmath10 ( edwin & roberts 1983 ; roberts et al .",
    "1984 ) , @xmath11^{1/2 } \\left({j_{0,s } \\over a } \\right)\\ , \\quad s=1,2,3, ... \\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the zeros of the bessel function @xmath13 . here",
    "we restrict our attention to the genuine sausage mode with transverse mode number @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . the cutoff frequency @xmath16 at the cutoff is @xmath17 . under coronal conditions ,",
    "the sound speed amounts typically to @xmath18 km s@xmath19 ( with @xmath20 mk ) , which is much smaller than the typical alfvn speed ( @xmath21 km s@xmath19 ) so we have @xmath22 . in this case the tube speed , @xmath23 is similar to the sound speed , @xmath24 , and the expression for the cutoff wave number @xmath10 ( eq .  1 ) simplifies to , @xmath25^{1/2}\\ ] ] in the low-@xmath26 corona , the thermal pressure is much smaller than the magnetic pressure , so that we can assume almost identical magnetic field strengths inside and outside of coronal loops , i.e. , @xmath27 , so that the ratio of external to the internal alfvn speed @xmath28 is essentially a density ratio @xmath29 , @xmath30^{1/2}\\ ] ]    from this expression we see that for typical density ratios inferred in the solar corona , e.g. , @xmath31 ( aschwanden et al . 2003 ) , the cutoff wave number @xmath32 falls into the range of @xmath33 . therefore , we would expect that a long - wavelength sausage mode oscillation is completely suppressed for the slender loops for which kink mode oscillations have been observed , which have wave numbers of @xmath34 ( aschwanden et al .",
    "coronal conditions with @xmath35 were also inferred from fast kink mode oscillations ( nakariakov & ofman 2001 ) .",
    "of course , higher harmonics would have correspondingly shorter wavelengths , i.e. @xmath36 with @xmath37 ) . on the other side ,",
    "the short - wavelength limit is given by the maximum possible loop width ( @xmath38 ) , so the maximum wave number is @xmath39 .",
    "the occurrence of global sausage mode oscillations therefore requires special conditions , @xmath40 , i.e. , very high density contrast @xmath41 and relatively thick loops to satisfy @xmath42 . the high density ratio , i.e. , @xmath43 or @xmath44 , yields the following simple expressions for the cutoff wave number @xmath10 , @xmath45 since the wavelength of the fundamental eigenmode ( with harmonic number @xmath46 in longitudinal direction and mode number @xmath14 in transverse direction ) corresponds to the double loop length , so that the wavenumber relates to the loop length by @xmath47 , the cutoff wave number condition @xmath42 implies a constraint between the loop geometry ratio @xmath48 and the density contrast @xmath49 , @xmath50 the numerical factor @xmath51 applies to the fundamental ( @xmath14 ) sausage mode . since geometric parameters ( such as @xmath52 and @xmath53 )",
    "can be measured easier than densities , we might turn the cutoff condition around and formulate it as a density contrast requirement for a given loop aspect ratio , @xmath54    this clearly indicates that slender loops with a high length - to - width ratio @xmath55 would require extremely high density contrast @xmath41 .",
    "typical active region loops , which have only a moderate density contrast in the order of @xmath56 , would be required to be extremely fat , with width - to - length ratios of @xmath57 .",
    "the density contrast is much higher for flare loops or postflare loops , up to @xmath58 . in this case",
    ", a length - to - width ratio of @xmath59 would be allowed for sausage mode oscillations .",
    "this brings us to the conclusion that global sausage type oscillations are only expected in fat and dense loops , basically only in flare and postflare loops , a prediction that was not appreciated until recently ( nakariakov et al .",
    "the restriction of the sausage mode wave number cutoff is visualized in fig .",
    "2 , where the permitted range of geometric loop aspect ratios @xmath60 is shown as function of the density contrast @xmath61 .    since the sausage mode is highly dispersive in the long - wavelength part of the spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) , the phase speed @xmath62 is a strong function of the wavenumber @xmath63 .",
    "the phase speed diagram fig .",
    "1 shows that the phase speed equals to the external alfvn speed at the long - wavelength cutoff , @xmath64 , and tends to approach the internal alfvn speed in the short - wavelength limit , @xmath65 . for coronal conditions ,",
    "the phase speed of both the fast kink and fast sausage mode are bound by the internal and external alfvn velocities , @xmath66 therefore , also the period ( @xmath67 ) of the standing sausage mode is bound by these two limits , @xmath68 at the lower limit we can derive a simple relation for the sausage mode period from the long - wavelength cutoff , where @xmath69 , using eq .",
    "6 , @xmath70 an approximation that is also derived in rosenberg ( 1970 ) and roberts et al .",
    "however , one should be aware that this relation represents only a lower limit that applies at @xmath71 , while for all other valid wavenumbers ( @xmath42 ) the loop length is shorter ( @xmath72 ) and thus the global sausage mode period @xmath73 is also shorter ( nakariakov et al . 2003 ) , given by the actual phase speed @xmath74 defined by the dispersion relation ( fig .",
    "1 ) at a particular value @xmath75 , @xmath76 provided that sufficiently fat and overdense loops exist according to the requirement ( eq .  6 or 7 ) , we expect for a loops radius of @xmath77 km and an alfvn speed of @xmath21 km s@xmath19 a typical sausage mode period of @xmath78 s ( according to eq .",
    "table 1 contains a compilation of radio observations of oscillation events with periods in the range of 0.5 s @xmath79 1 min .",
    "most of these observations have been interpreted in terms of mhd fast sausage mode oscillations , mainly for three reasons : ( 1 ) eigen - modes of standing mhd waves provide a natural mechanism for oscillations with a strictly regular period ; ( 2 ) the period range of @xmath1 s was expected for the mhd fast sausage mode under coronal conditions , while other mhd oscillations modes have significantly longer periods ; and ( 3 ) the mhd fast sausage mode modulates the loop density , magnetic field strength , and related radio emission ( plasma emission or gyrosynchrotron emission ) , while the mhd kink mode does not modulate the loop density in first order .",
    "in addition we might add a forth reason which has not been appreciated previously : these events listed in table 1 were generally reported to occur during flares , which explains the high densities that are expected on theoretical grounds ( due to the sausage mode wave number cutoff criterion @xmath80 , see eq .",
    "7 ) , which does not occur for the mhd kink mode .    because the loop density plays a critical role for mhd fast sausage mode oscillations ( eq .",
    "7 ) , we listed in table 1 only observations that have information on the period @xmath81 as well on the electron density @xmath82 of the oscillating loops .",
    "there are only two observations with direct electron density measurements , using soft x - ray emission measures and constraints from the microwave spectrum , which report electron densities of @xmath83 @xmath84 ( asai et al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath85 @xmath84 ( melnikov et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , we might also extract information on the electron density from any radio burst that is produced by an emission mechanism near the plasma frequency , since the plasma frequency depends only on the electron density @xmath82 , @xmath86 } \\qquad { \\rm [ hz ] } \\ .\\ ] ] plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism for metric and decimetric radio bursts up to frequencies of @xmath87 ghz , while free - free emission , gyroresonance , and gyrosynchrotron emission dominate at higher frequencies ( e.g. , see dulk 1985 ) . a cursory look at table 1 shows that most of the reported oscillations fall in the frequency range of @xmath88 mhz , so this corresponds to electron densities of @xmath89 @xmath84 in the case of plasma emission . in fig .",
    "3 we display the observed oscillation periods @xmath81 as function of the observed radio frequency @xmath90 .",
    "the observed radio frequency uniquely constrains the density @xmath82 of the oscillating loop segment , for the case of plasma emission . in order to estimate the external density @xmath91",
    "we can use a standard model of the average background corona , for instance the baumbach - allen model , which as function of the normalized height @xmath92 is , @xmath93          \\approx { 4\\times 10 ^ 8 \\over r^9 } \\quad [ { \\rm cm}^{-3}]\\ ] ] where the approximation on the right - hand - side holds for @xmath94 .",
    "this density model @xmath95 is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( top ) . assuming that the fattest possible loops have a width - to - length ratio of @xmath96 , the minimum required density ratio is @xmath97 ( eq .  7 ) for loops oscillating in the mhd fast sausage mode due to the long - wavelength cutoff criterion ( eq .  5 ) .",
    "this cutoff criterion implies the constraint that physical solutions are only possible for heights @xmath98 mm , for oscillations observed in the plasma frequency range of @xmath99 ghz ( grey area in fig.4 top ) .",
    "the two events observed by asai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and melnikov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) do not fall in this range , because their density is higher and would correspond to plasma frequencies of @xmath100 and 3 ghz . the important conclusion that follows , based on the two assumptions that the baumbach - allen model represents a realistic density model of the background corona and that oscillating loops are not fatter than a quarter of their length , is that physical solutions for the mhd fast sausage mode are only possible for coronal heights of @xmath98 mm in the observed frequency range of @xmath101 ghz , where most of the fast oscillations have been observed ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "next we investigate the constraints introduced by the pulse periods , which are found in the range of @xmath102 s ( fig .",
    "3 ) . denoting the length of the loop segment that participates in the mhd fast sausage mode oscillation with @xmath103",
    ", we obtain an upper limit from the phase speed at the wavenumber cutoff @xmath10 ( eqs .  9 , 11 ) , @xmath104 where the alfvnic speed @xmath105 is given by the background density model @xmath95 ( eq .  13 ) , @xmath106\\ , \\ ] ] where we used a mean molecular weight of @xmath107 for the h : he=10:1 coronal abundance .",
    "we plot the sausage mode period @xmath73 as function of the wavelength @xmath103 in fig .  4 ( bottom ) , for a mean coronal magnetic field of @xmath108 g ( solid line ) , as well as for a factor of 2 smaller or larger values ( @xmath109 g ) .",
    "we find that the corresponding wavelength of the oscillating loop segments have values in the range of @xmath110 mm @xmath111 10 mm ( gray area in fig",
    ".  4 bottom ) for pulse periods of @xmath112 s , which is much smaller than the full loop length ( @xmath113 mm , see gray area in fig",
    ".  4 top ) required for the fundamental sausage mode . because physical solutions are only possible in heights @xmath114 mm , the oscillating loop segment has to be located near the top of the loop .",
    "thus we conclude that only a small segment of the loop is oscillating in the mhd sausage mode .",
    "such small oscillating loop segments require wavelengths that correspond to higher harmonics @xmath115 of the fast sausage mhd mode , @xmath116 while lower harmonics can not oscillate due to the wave number cutoff .",
    "the situation is illustrated for the case @xmath117 in fig .  5 : for instance , if the cutoff is @xmath118 , only wavelengths with @xmath119 are able to oscillate , which is most likely to occur at the loop top where the density contrast and wavelength match the sausage wavenumber cutoff criterion .",
    "alternatively , oscillations at a higher harmonic could occur along the entire loop , but favorable conditions for detection could be restricted to certain segments only ( e.g. , due to line - of - sight angles or absorption of plasma emission ) .    an alternative interpretation of these fast radio pulsations in the decimetric range could be made in terms of propagating fast sausage mode mhd waves , where the wavelength is not prescribed by the loop length , but independently by the driver .",
    "this interpretation has been proposed in roberts et al .",
    "however , if this would be the case , the radio dynamic spectra should show parallel drifting bands of emission for every propagating node .",
    "such decimetric burst types have indeed been observed and are called _ decimetric fiber bursts _",
    "( e.g. , rosenberg 1972 ; bernold 1980 ; slottje 1981 ) , but many of the observations listed in table 1 show narrowband pulsations without parallel drifting bands , and thus are not consistent with ( impulsively generated ) propagating fast sausage mhd waves .",
    "note that the measurements of asai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and melnikov et al . (",
    "2002 ) have longer periods and higher densities than all decimetric observations listed in table 1 , and thus actually allow for global sausage mode oscillations of the entire loop length , for reasonable magnetic fields in the order of @xmath120 g ( marked with crosses in fig",
    ".  4 bottom ) .",
    "this study leads us to the following conclusions :    1 .    only the two imaging observations of fast oscillation events ( @xmath121 s ) by asai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and melnikov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are consistent with global mhd fast sausage mode oscillations , satisfying the relation between period and loop lengths as well as the wave number cutoff criterion for the fundamental sausage mode .",
    "the required magnetic field is of the order of @xmath120 g. 2 .",
    "all earlier radio observations of fast oscillation events , which have been reported in the frequency range of @xmath122100 mhz @xmath123 1 ghz and with periods of @xmath124 s , imply for reasonable coronal magnetic field strengths ( @xmath125 g ) that the length of the loop segments participating in the mhd fast sausage mode oscillation is much smaller ( @xmath126 mm ) than the full loop length ( @xmath127 mm ) .",
    "the sausage mode oscillation seems to be confined to segments where the largest density contrast to the background occurs , most likely near the loop top , in a segment corresponding to a higher harmonic node ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "3 .    the wave number cutoff criterion seems to introduce a bimodality of mhd fast mode sausage oscillation phenomena : ( 1 ) partial loop oscillations confined to loop segments ( @xmath128 ) of high harmonic @xmath129 nodes for low - density ( @xmath130 @xmath84 ) loops that are observable at the plasma frequency in the metric / decimetric frequency range ( @xmath101 ghz ) ; and ( 2 ) global loop oscillations ( @xmath131 ) at the fundamental mode ( @xmath46 ) for high - density ( @xmath132 @xmath84 ) loops that are observable in soft x - rays and via gyrosynchrotron emission in microwaves .    in this study",
    "we explored the diagnostic of mhd fast sausage mode oscillations .",
    "it is important to notice that the observed period does not provide a diagnostic of the alfvnic travel time across the loop diameter ( @xmath133 ) , as it was commonly believed , but rather provides a lower limit of this quantity ( nakariakov et al .",
    "moreover , the new finding that fast periods are likely to be caused by oscillations of partial loop segments ( at higher harmonic nodes ) , implies that the magnetic field @xmath134 can not be determined by the loop diameter and sausage mode period , unless the harmonic number can be constrained from imaging observations .",
    "this study illustrates specific constraints that are contingent on the sausage wave number cutoff , which have been ignored in previous studies .",

    "<S> a recent study by nakariakov et al . pointed out that the dispersion relation of mhd sausage mode oscillations has been incorrectly applied to coronal loops , neglecting the highly dispersive nature of the phase speed and the long - wavelength cutoff of the wave number . in the light of these new insights </S>",
    "<S> we revisit previous observations that have been interpreted in terms of mhd sausage mode oscillations in coronal loops and come to the following conclusions : ( 1 ) fast sausage mhd mode oscillations require such a high electron density imposed by the wave number cutoff that they can only occur in flare loops ; ( 2 ) in the previously reported radio observations ( @xmath0 mhz to 1 ghz ) with periods of @xmath1 s , the fast sausage mhd mode oscillation is likely to be confined to a small segment ( corresponding to a high harmonic node ) near the apex of the loop , rather than involving a global oscillation over the entire loop length . the recent microwave and soft x - ray observations of fast periods ( @xmath2 s ) by asai et al . and melnikov et al . </S>",
