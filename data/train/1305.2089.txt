    "<S> our considerations reveal that the interacting fermi surface of a uniform metallic ground state ( whether isotropic or anisotropic ) _ can not _ be calculated exactly to order @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , in the coupling constant @xmath3 of the interaction potential in terms of the self - energy calculated to order @xmath1 in a non - self - consistent fashion . </S>",

    "<S> we further show that the same mechanism that embodies the luttinger theorem within the framework of the exact theory , accounts for a non - trivial dependence of the exact self - energy on @xmath3 that can not be captured within a non - self - consistent framework . </S>",
