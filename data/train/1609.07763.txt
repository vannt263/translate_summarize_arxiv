    "these methods have proven to be useful and interesting for engineers working in control theory .",
    "some original results in the study of oscillatory solutions for delay differential equations , applying the frequency domain methodology , were presented in the book of moiola and chen [ 1996 ] .",
    "thereafter , this theory was applied and extended @xcite and generalized in @xcite , to include more general delayed systems .",
    "all these results , however , only consider a harmonic balance approximation up to eight order .",
    "various applications of the frequency domain methodology can be found in @xcite .    in the framework of the frequency domain we consider an harmonic balance of a given order ,",

    "[ analysis ] , we show how to analyze the bifurcation equation using tools of singularity theory , and we determine different conditions to find all cycle bifurcations of codimension less than or equal to two .",

    "in section [ analysis ] we will obtain sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of andronov - hopf bifurcation as well as other bifurcations of periodic solutions of codimension less than or equal to two .",
    "these conditions are obtained by studying the bifurcation equation in the frequency domain .",
    "the bifurcation equation will be calculated in the following subsection .",
    "we will now obtain a theorem for delay differential equations of the form .",

    "this theorem gives us a bifurcation equation of non - trivial periodic orbits that is very useful to determine the existence and expression of periodic solutions .",
    "the study of the bifurcation equation expressed in suitable coordinates and using singularity theory @xcite , allows us to determine existence and multiplicity of cycles .",
    "furthermore , the theorem gives us analytical expressions for periodic solutions .",
    "based on the ideas in the proof , we propose an iterative method to make high order calculations for both the bifurcation equation and the approximated periodic solutions .
