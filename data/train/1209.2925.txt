    "the ( pseudo)scalar meson decay constants @xmath14 are of prime interests for understanding the realizations of chiral symmetry in qcd .",
    "in addition to the well - known values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 which control the light flavour chiral symmetries , it is also desirable to extract the ones of the heavy - light charm and bottom quark systems with high - accuracy .",

    "different earlier papers @xcite have been scrutinized in @xcite , where narison found that the apparent discrepancies between the different qssr results can be solved if one applies carefully the stability criteria ( also called sum rule window ) of the results versus the external qssr variables and continuum threshold @xmath20 . in this way , and for given values of @xmath21 , he obtained the values : @xmath22 which are independent of the forms of the sum rules used .",
    "however , the result has been quite surprising as it indicates a large violation of the heavy quark symmetry scaling predictions @xcite , where @xmath23 corrections have been estimated numerically in @xcite . this  unexpected result \" has been confirmed few years later by lattice calculations @xcite . in this talk , we present improved estimates and bounds on @xmath14 and on @xmath24 obtained recently in @xcite in full qcd theory , where the most recent values of the ( non-)perturbative qcd parameters given in table [ tab : param ] have been used . the expressions of nlo pt in @xcite , of n2lo pt in @xcite , of the non - perturbative in @xcite and the light quark mass corrections in @xcite have been used .",
