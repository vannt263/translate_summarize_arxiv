    "massive stars dynamically interact with the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) via their fast stellar winds and supernova ejecta .",
    "ob associations , with their large concentrations of massive stars , provide an excellent laboratory to study these interactions .",
    "the combined actions of the stellar winds and the supernovae from the massive stars in ob associations sweep up the ambient ism to form expanding shells called superbubbles @xcite .",
    "the physical structure of a superbubble is very similar to that of a bubble blown by the stellar wind of an isolated massive star , as modeled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "theoretically , an interstellar bubble consists of a shell of swept - up ism with its interior filled by shocked fast wind at temperatures of 10@xmath710@xmath8  k. there are two basic types of models for wind - blown bubbles : energy - conserving and momentum - conserving . in the former , the shocked stellar wind is separated from the swept - up interstellar shell by a contact discontinuity , where heat conduction and mass evaporation may take place .",
    "the expansion of the shell is driven by the pressure of the hot interior gas @xcite . in the momentum conserving bubbles , the fast stellar winds impinge on the swept - up shell directly , and the expansion is driven by the momentum of the fast stellar wind @xcite .",
    "one significant difference between a superbubble and a single star bubble is the possibility that supernovae may occur inside a superbubble and introduce significant perturbations in the surface brightness and characteristic temperature of the x - ray emission , especially if a supernova explodes near the dense shell @xcite .",
    "this intermittent x - ray brightening has been observed in superbubbles in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . using _ einstein _ and",
    "_ rosat _ observations , @xcite and @xcite have reported diffuse x - ray emission from a large number of superbubbles in the lmc , and their x - ray luminosities all exceed the luminosities expected by weaver et al.s bubble model , indicating recent heating by supernovae .",
    "no lmc superbubbles in a quiescent state , i.e. , without recent supernova heating , have been detected in x - rays by _ rosat _ @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to detect diffuse x - ray emission from a quiescent superbubble and compare it to model expectations , as this could provide a valuable diagnostic of bubble models .",
    "the emission nebula m17 ( from the catalog of * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000.0 ) , also known as the omega nebula , the horseshoe nebula , and ngc6618 ) is located on the eastern edge of a massive molecular cloud , m17sw @xcite .",
    "m17 exhibits a `` blister - like '' structure with an overall diameter of @xmath020@xmath1125@xmath11 , or @xmath01012  pc at an adopted distance of 1.6  kpc @xcite .",
    "the nebula encompasses an open cluster with a stellar age of @xmath01  myr @xcite .",
    "the open cluster is located on the western side of the nebula , which borders the molecular cloud .",
    "arcuate filaments extend eastward , creating a shell morphology , and suggesting that it is a young superbubble blown by the ob stars within .",
    "the young age of the cluster in m17 implies that no supernova explosions have occurred , thus m17 provides an ideal setting to study the generation of hot gas solely by fast stellar winds inside a superbubble at a quiescent state .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of m17 have revealed diffuse x - ray emission in the vicinity of the embedded open cluster @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "diffuse x - ray emission from m17 over a more extended area was previously detected in a _",
    "rosat _ observation but was never reported .",
    "we have analyzed this diffuse x - ray emission from the interior of m17 detected by _",
    "rosat _ to determine the physical properties of the hot interior gas , and considered bubble models with and without heat conduction .",
    "we find that models with heat conduction produce results with the largest discrepancy from the observed x - ray luminosity and hot gas temperature and mass of the superbubble in m17 . this paper reports our analysis of the _ rosat _ observations of m17 and comparisons to a range of bubble models .",
    "we have used an archival _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observation to study the diffuse x - ray emission from m17 and investigate the physical properties of the hot , shocked gas interior to the superbubble .",
    "the pspc is sensitive to x - rays in the energy range 0.12.4 kev and has an energy resolution of @xmath040% at 1 kev , with a field of view of @xmath02@xmath12 .",
    "further information on the pspc can be found in the @xcite .",
    "the pspc observation of m17 ( sequence number rp500311 , pi : aschenbach ) was obtained on 1993 september 1213 .",
    "it is centered on the nebula at @xmath13(j2000 ) = 18@xmath14 21@xmath15 04@xmath1678 and @xmath17(j2000 ) = @xmath1816@xmath19 10@xmath11 120 , and has an exposure time of 6.7  ks .",
    "as m17 has an angular size of @xmath020@xmath1125@xmath11 , the diffuse x - ray emission from the superbubble interior is well contained within the inner window support ring of the pspc .",
    "the pspc data were reduced using standard routines in the pros package under the iraf environment .      to compare the spatial distribution of the x - ray - emitting gas with that of the cooler ionized gas in m17 , we have obtained narrow - band h@xmath13  images of this emission nebula .",
    "m17 was observed with the mount laguna 1-m telescope on 2002 october 2831 using a tektronik 2k ccd .",
    "a filter with peak transmission at 6563   and a fwhm of 20   was used to isolate the h@xmath13  line . because the 2k ccd has @xmath004 pixels and a field - of - view of 136",
    ", the entire nebula could not be observed in a single exposure .",
    "instead a total of twenty - four 300  s exposures were acquired at 8 positions to span the nebula .",
    "these exposures were combined to form a mosaic image of the nebula and to reject cosmic - ray events in the individual images using the methods outlined in @xcite .",
    "significant x - ray emission is detected from m17 in the pspc observation , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : xrayopt ] . to determine the nature and origin of this emission",
    ", we have analyzed its spatial distribution and spectral properties .",
    "we have examined the distribution of the x - ray emission and compared it to the optical morphology of the emission nebula .",
    "we have also extracted spectra from the pspc data and modeled them to determine the physical conditions of the hot gas .      to study the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission from m17 , the data were binned to 5@xmath20 pixels and then smoothed with a gaussian function of @xmath21 = 4 pixels ( see figure  [ fig : xrayopt]a ) .",
    "we have also taken our h@xmath13  mosaic and overlaid it with x - ray emission contours to study the extent of x - ray emission within the region ( see figure  [ fig : xrayopt]b ) .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is observed to be well confined by the optical nebula .",
    "this diffuse emission shows no evidence of limb brightening , suggesting that the interior of m17 is centrally filled with hot gas .",
    "the peak of the x - ray emission is coincident with the center of the open cluster in m17 , where _ chandra _ observations show a large number of point sources superposed on the diffuse emission @xcite .",
    "this spatial distribution suggests that the x - ray - emitting hot gas originates in the open cluster , as would be expected in a bubble blown by stellar winds .",
    "as there is a massive molecular cloud to the west of m17 , we expect the hot gas to expand more rapidly to the east ; this flow of hot gas to the east has then blown the blister - like bubble seen in optical images .",
    "four additional point sources are detected in the field around m17 .",
    "the brightest of these point sources lies to the south of the x - ray peak and has been previously designated 1wga  j1820.6@xmath181615 in the wga catalog of _ rosat _ point sources @xcite .",
    "this point source is coincident with oi  352 @xcite , an o8 star on the southern edge of the open cluster in m17 .",
    "the other three point sources lie on the northern edge of the emission nebula .",
    "these x - ray point sources , designated as 1wga  j1820.8@xmath181603 , 1wga  j1821.0@xmath181600 , and 1wga  j1820.8@xmath181556 , are coincident with stars gsc  06265@xmath1801977 , sao  161369 ( a known o5 star ) , and gsc  06265@xmath1801808 , respectively .",
    "these point sources are marked in figure  [ fig : xrayopt]a .      in order to examine the spectra of the diffuse x - ray emission , we first excluded the point sources found in  [ sec : xraydist ] .",
    "then , noting that m17 is on the edge of a dense molecular cloud , we have sectioned the nebula into four regions to account for anticipated changes in the foreground absorption column density .",
    "these regions have been labeled a , b , c , and d and are displayed in figure  [ fig : xrayreg ] .",
    "additionally , we have selected a background annulus around the superbubble , as indicated in figure  [ fig : xrayreg ] .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra were then extracted from the pspc event files .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra of the superbubble is a convolution of several factors : the intrinsic x - ray spectrum of the superbubble , the intervening interstellar absorption , and the pspc response function .",
    "because the interstellar absorption and the pspc response function are dependent on photon energy , we must assume models of the intrinsic x - ray spectrum and the interstellar absorption to make the problem tractable .",
    "as the x - ray emission from the superbubble interior appears largely diffuse , we have used the @xcite thermal plasma emission model to describe the intrinsic x - ray spectra of the superbubble and the @xcite effective absorption cross - section per hydrogen atom for the foreground absorption , assuming solar abundances for both the emitting and absorbing materials .",
    "we then simulated the observed spectrum , combining the assumed models for the intrinsic spectrum and the interstellar absorption with the response function of the pspc .",
    "the best - fit spectrum is found by varying parameters and comparing @xmath22 for the simulated and observed spectra .",
    "we performed a @xmath22 grid search of simulated spectral fits to determine the best - fit levels for the thermal plasma temperature , @xmath23 , and absorption column density , @xmath24 .",
    "plots of the best fits to the x - ray spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : xrayspec ] , and @xmath22 plots are presented in figure  [ fig : xraygrid ] . the @xmath22 plots of regions a , b , and c indicate that the x - ray emission can be fit by either higher temperature plasma , @xmath00.7  kev , with lower absorption column density , @xmath010@xmath25  @xmath26 , or lower temperature plasma , @xmath00.2  kev , with higher absorption column density , @xmath010@xmath27  @xmath26 .",
    "this is a common problem for pspc spectra with a limited number of counts because of the poor spectral resolution and soft energy coverage of the pspc .",
    "the best model fits favor the higher temperature plasma and lower absorption column density solution .",
    "indeed , the detection of soft x - ray emission below 0.5  kev indicates that the solution with @xmath28@xmath010@xmath27  @xmath26 can not be valid , as such a solution predicts no significant soft x - ray emission should be detected .",
    "furthermore , the high absorption column density solution predicts a foreground absorption column density for m17 equal to the total galactic column density along the line of sight @xcite . as m17 is located in the plane of the galaxy at @xmath29 , @xmath30 and has a distance of 1.6  kpc , we do not expect the majority of the galactic toward this direction to be located in front of the superbubble .    from the model",
    "fits , we calculated the unabsorbed x - ray flux , and therefore the x - ray luminosity , @xmath31 , of the diffuse x - ray emission from each source region .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath32 , of the thermal plasma model is equal to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electron and proton number densities , @xmath36 is the volume of the superbubble , and @xmath37 is the distance to the source . assuming a he : h number ratio of 1:10 and that the x - ray emitting gas is completely ionized , we find @xmath38 , and that the volume emission measure can be expressed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the volume filling factor .",
    "we have used the diameter of the superbubble , @xmath01012  pc , as the depth of the x - ray emitting gas in each source region .",
    "we determined the volume , @xmath36 , of each source region by multiplying the surface area of the region by the depth and a geometric correction factor of 2/3 ( approximated by the volume ratio of a sphere to a cylinder ) . taking the volume filling factor to be @xmath40=0.5 , we then calculated rms @xmath34 in each region .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath23 , @xmath32 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 and rms @xmath34 are given in table  [ tbl : xspecfit ] .",
    "note that the model fit to region d did not converge because it contains a large number of unresolved stellar sources as well as diffuse emission ; only approximate values for the x - ray luminosity and absorption column density are given .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed analysis of the _ chandra _ observations of region d.    combining our results from each of the source regions , we find a total diffuse x - ray luminosity of @xmath02.5@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 in the _ rosat _ pspc 0.12.4  kev band , a mean characteristic temperature of @xmath41  0.72  kev or @xmath428.5@xmath110@xmath4  k , a mean electron density of @xmath00.09  @xmath43 , and a total hot gas mass of @xmath01  m@xmath44 .",
    "we have calculated the total thermal energy in hot , shocked wind component of the superbubble to be @xmath45  1@xmath110@xmath46  ergs with a cooling timescale of @xmath47  40  myr . given the stellar age of the open cluster , @xmath01  myr",
    ", we do not expect significant radiative cooling to have occurred .",
    "as a rough check , we multiply the current x - ray luminosity by the age of the cluster and find that the total energy radiated away by the x - ray emission is @xmath4810% of the total thermal energy .",
    "we now compare the observed physical properties of m17 determined above to theoretical calculations from basic wind - blown bubble models .",
    "although the m17 superbubble is in an inhomogeneous ambient medium with a significant density gradient and the cluster is off - centered ( a more complex scenario than is considered in basic bubble models ) , if the superbubble structure is indeed governed by the physical processes prescribed by these models , we expect the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission to agree with predictions within similar orders of magnitude .",
    "we first consider the wind - blown bubble model of @xcite and will later consider a wind - blown bubble model without heat conduction .      in the weaver et al .",
    "model , heat conduction and mass evaporation act across the boundary between the hot interior gas and the nebular shell to lower the temperature and raise the density of the bubble interior .",
    "the temperature and electron density profiles of such a bubble have been calculated by @xcite , and the x - ray luminosities of such bubbles can be determined using two methods outlined by @xcite . in the first method , we derive the expected x - ray luminosity from the observed physical properties of the gas in the 10@xmath49  k ionized shell of swept - up ism . in the second method",
    ", we use the spectral types of massive stars in m17 to estimate the combined mechanical luminosity of the stellar winds and then derive the expected x - ray luminosity .",
    "these two methods use independent input parameters and thus allow us to check the consistency of the pressure - driven bubble model in addition to comparing the expected and observed x - ray luminosities .",

    "the ambient density @xmath53 can not be measured directly , but assuming that the ram pressure of the expanding shell is equal to the thermal pressure of the ionized superbubble shell , the relation between the ambient density and the density of the ionized shell is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electron number density in the ionized shell , @xmath58  10@xmath49  k is the electron temperature in the ionized shell , @xmath59 is the expansion velocity of the bubble , and @xmath60 @xcite . adopting a mean electron density of @xmath61  300  @xmath43 @xcite and an observed @xmath62  25  km  s@xmath3@xcite ,",

    "we again take the expansion velocity to be @xmath025  km  s@xmath3  @xcite and the radius to be 56  pc and derive a bubble age of @xmath00.13  myr .    to determine the wind luminosity of m17",
    ", we examined its massive stellar content .",
    "@xcite identified nine o stars and four late - o / early - b stars in the open cluster . using the spectral types of these massive stars ,",
    "we have estimated their terminal stellar wind velocities , effective temperatures , and luminosities based on the stellar parameters given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the mass - loss rates for the ob stars in m17 by utilizing the empirically derived relationship between effective temperature , luminosity , and mass - loss rate of @xcite .",

    "we calculated the total mechanical luminosity of the stellar winds , @xmath75 from the ob stars to be @xmath01@xmath110@xmath67  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the identified ob stars can approximately account for the ionization of the emission nebula ; we therefore expect our calculated wind mechanical luminosity to be reasonably complete as well . assuming a relatively constant mechanical luminosity",
    ", we find a total energy deposited by stellar winds of @xmath04@xmath110@xmath76  ergs over the life of the bubble .",
    "in addition , this value of the wind mechanical luminosity gives an ambient density of @xmath060  @xmath43 and an expected x - ray luminosity of @xmath05@xmath110@xmath64  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "this x - ray luminosity value is consistent to within a factor of two with the value found by method 1 .",
    "although the two methods of determining the expected x - ray luminosity are consistent with each other , they do not agree with the x - ray luminosity derived from the pspc observation .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity is @xmath0100200 times lower than expected from weaver et al.s bubble model .",
    "it is possible that stellar winds are clumpy , as suggested by @xcite , then the conventionally derived mass loss rates would be reduced by a factor of @xmath63 . even using the reduced mass loss rates , the expected x - ray luminosity is more than 40 times too high .",
    "the observed temperature , density , and surface brightness of the hot gas in m17 do not agree with the model expectations , either .",
    "the physical conditions of the shocked stellar winds in weaver et al.s model are heavily modified by heat conduction and the hot gas mass is dominated by the nebular mass evaporated across the interface .",
    "the predicted temperature is 5.05.6@xmath110@xmath4 k near the center and decreases outward , the predicted density is 0.20.4 @xmath43 near the center and increases outward , and the x - ray surface brightness is expected to show limb - brightening . compared with observed properties , the expected temperature is too low , density is too high , and the x - ray morphology is inconsistent .",
    "the disagreements between observations and model expectations suggest that heat conduction may not play a dominant role in determining the physical conditions inside this superbubble .",
    "heat conduction can be suppressed by the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength in m17 has been measured via the zeeman effect to be 100550  @xmath77 g , peaking near the interface between the region and the molecular cloud m17sw @xcite .",
    "assuming a comparable magnetic field strength in the swept - up 10@xmath49  k shell , we find the alfvn speed to be 1060  km  s@xmath3  which is comparable to or much greater than the isothermal sound velocity of the 10@xmath49  k gas , 10  km  s@xmath3for h atoms .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field strength and isothermal sound velocity indicate a gyro - radius of @xmath4810  km for protons in the swept - up shell .",
    "this suggests that the protons in the 10@xmath49  k gas will be unable to escape the magnetic field and diffuse into the interior of the superbubble , inhibiting heat conduction and mass evaporation between the hot interior and the cool shell of the bubble .",
    "we now turn our consideration to a wind - blown bubble without heat conduction .",
    "the x - ray emission of a bubble interior depends on both the temperature and the amount of hot gas .",
    "we will first compare the plasma temperature expected from the shocked stellar winds to the observed hot gas temperature . using the combined stellar winds mass - loss rate of 4.3@xmath110@xmath78  m@xmath5  yr@xmath3 ( summed from table  [ tbl : starpar ] ) and the integrated wind mechanical luminosity @xmath79 of 1@xmath110@xmath67  ergs  s@xmath3 as calculated in ",
    "[ sec : windlum ] , we derive an rms terminal wind velocity of @xmath80  2700  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the post - shock temperature of the combined stellar winds is therefore expected to be @xmath08@xmath110@xmath81  k. this temperature is an order of magnitude higher than that indicated by pspc observations ; to lower it to the observed temperature of @xmath08.6@xmath110@xmath4  k requires the mixing in of cold nebular mass that is nearly 10 times the mass of the combined stellar winds .",
    "this mixing may be provided by turbulent instabilities at the interface between the shocked fast winds and the cold nebular shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or through the hydronamic ablation of clumps of cold nebular material distributed within the hot bubble interior @xcite .",
    "assuming that mixing has taken place , we next determine the hot gas mass expected as a result of mixing and compare it to the observed value (  [ sec : xrayspec ] ) . given the dynamical age of the superbubble , 0.13  myr , a total stellar wind mass of @xmath00.56  m@xmath5 has been injected to the superbubble interior , and the expected total mass of the hot gas will be 56  m@xmath5 .",
    "this is significantly greater than the observed value of @xmath01  m@xmath5 .",
    "this discrepancy can be reduced if we again consider the possibility of clumpy stellar winds @xcite . with the mass - loss rates reduced by a factor of @xmath63 ,",
    "the expected hot gas mass is @xmath02  m@xmath44 , which would be in remarkable agreement with the observed value .",
    "we summarize the comparison between the observed x - ray emission and the various models in table  [ tbl : xrayprop ] , which lists the observed x - ray luminosity and hot gas temperature and mass as well as those expected from models with and without heat conduction for both homogeneous winds and clumpy winds .",
    "it is clear that bubble models with heat conduction have the largest discrepancies from the observations .",
    "the best agreement with observed properties is from bubble models without heat conduction but allowing dynamical mixing of cold nebular material with the hot gas . for models either with or without heat conduction , clumpy winds with reduced mass loss rates",
    "are needed to minimize the discrepancy between model expectations and observations .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission has been previously detected from other types of wind - blown bubbles , including planetary nebulae ( pne ) and circumstellar bubbles blown by wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "the x - ray emission from these circumstellar bubbles is qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of m17 .",
    "@xcite find that the x - ray emission from pne and wr bubbles shows a limb - brightened spatial distribution , in sharp contrast to the centrally - filled spatial distribution in m17 as described in ",
    "[ sec : xraydist ] .",
    "further , @xcite note that pne and wr bubbles exhibit hot gas temperatures of 13@xmath110@xmath4  k and electron densities of 10100  @xmath43 , while the hot interior gas of m17 exhibits a temperature of 8.5@xmath110@xmath4  k and a substantially lower electron density of @xmath00.09  @xmath43 .",
    "the comparisons of morphology and temperature between the m17 superbubble and small circumstellar bubbles show fundamental differences .",
    "the limb - brightened x - ray spatial distribution , low temperatures , and high electron densities of pne and wr bubbles are qualitatively consistent with a hypothesis of heat conduction and mass evaporation occurring between the hot gas interior and the swept - up shell . however , the observed x - ray luminosities for pne and wr bubbles are both significantly lower ( 10100 times ) than predicted by bubble models with heat conduction @xcite .",
    "it is possible that in these wind - blown bubbles , heat conduction has also been suppressed and that dynamical mixing , which allows a lower mass injection rate , occurs at the interface between the hot gas interior and the cool nebular shell .",
    "exploring this question will require magnetic field measurements of pne and wr bubbles .",
    "we have presented analysis of a _ rosat _ observation of the emission nebula m17 .",
    "the blister - like morphology seen in the optical images indicates that it is a superbubble blown by the winds of its ob stars in an inhomogeneous ism . with a stellar age of @xmath01  myr",
    ", m17 must be a young quiescent superbubble without any supernova heating .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected from m17 and is confined within the optical shell .",

    "analysis of the diffuse x - ray emission indicates a characteristic gas temperature @xmath08.5  @xmath1  10@xmath4  k with a mean electron number density of 0.09  @xmath43 .",
    "we have considered bubble models with and without heat conduction and found that those with heat conduction overpredict the x - ray luminosity by two orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field measured in m17 is large enough to suppress heat conduction and associated mass evaporation .",
    "bubble models without heat conduction overestimate the hot gas temperature unless mixing with cold nebular gas has occurred . if nebular gas can be dynamically mixed into the hot bubble interior and if the stellar winds are clumpy with a lower mass - loss rate , the x - ray morphology and luminosity , and hot gas temperature and mass can be reasonably reproduced .",
    "m17 provides us a rare opportunity to probe the physical conditions of hot gas energized solely by shocked stellar winds in a quiescent superbubble .",

    "<S> the emission nebula m17 contains a young @xmath01  myr - old open cluster ; the winds from the ob stars of this cluster have blown a superbubble around the cluster . </S>",

    "<S> the young age of the cluster suggests that no supernovae have yet occurred in m17 ; therefore , it provides a rare opportunity to study hot gas energized solely by shocked stellar winds in a quiescent superbubble . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the diffuse x - ray emission from m17 , and compared the observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath02.5@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 and the hot gas temperature of @xmath08.5@xmath110@xmath4  k and mass of @xmath01  m@xmath5 to model predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bubble models with heat conduction overpredict the x - ray luminosity by two orders of magnitude ; the strong magnetic fields in m17 , as measured from zeeman observations , have most likely inhibited heat conduction and associated mass evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> bubble models without heat conduction can explain the x - ray properties of m17 , but only if cold nebular gas can be dynamically mixed into the hot bubble interior and the stellar winds are clumpy with mass - loss rates reduced by a factor of @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> . future models of the m17 superbubble must take into account the large - scale density gradient , small - scale clumpiness , and strong magnetic field in the ambient interstellar medium . </S>"
