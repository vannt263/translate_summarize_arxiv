    "in the coma galaxy sample the statistical significance for dm halos is over @xmath13 for 8 ( out of 17 ) galaxies ( ( * ? ? ? * thomas  2007b ) ) , whereas the abell  262 sample reveals 4 ( out of 8) galaxies of this kind ( ( * ? ? ? *",

    "the evidence for a dm component in addition mass that follows light is not directly connected to the spatial extent of the kinematic data , degree of rotation , or flattening of the system .",

    "we can not discriminate between cuspy and logarithmic halos based on the quality of the kinematic fits , except for ngc  703 where the logarithmic halo fits better .",

    "however , in all gravity - based methods there is a fundamental degeneracy concerning the interpretation of mass - to - light ratios .",
    "such methods can not uniquely discriminate between luminous and dark matter once they follow similar radial distributions .",
    "the distinction is always based on the assumption that the mass density profile of the dm differs from that of the luminous matter .",
    "one extreme point of view is the assumption that the stellar masses in early - type galaxies are maximal and correspond to @xmath10 .",
    "the immediate consequence is that the stellar imf in early - type galaxies is not universal , varying from kroupa - like at low velocity dispersions to salpeter ( or steeper ) in the most massive galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "recent attempts to measure the stellar imf directly from near - infrared observations point in the same direction ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see conroy & van dokkum 2012 , and references therein ) ) .",
    "however , we also find the galaxies with the largest @xmath23 have the lowest halo - mass fractions inside @xmath3 and vice versa .",
    "a possible explanation for this finding is a dm distribution that follows the light very closely in massive galaxies and contaminates the measured @xmath10 , while it is more distinct from the light in lower - mass systems .",
    "this has been suggested elsewhere as a signature of violent relaxation .",
    "one option to further constrain the mass - decomposition of gravity - based models is to incorporate predictions from cosmological simulations that confine the maximum amount of dm that can be plausibly attached to a galaxy of a given stellar mass .",
    "since adiabatic contraction increases the amount of dm in the galaxy center , it could be in principle a viable mechanism to lower the required stellar masses towards a kroupa imf ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* napolitano  2010 , but see also cappellari  2012 ) ) .",
    "an immediate consequence is that some of the mass that follows the light is actually dm , increasing the dm fraction to about @xmath36 of the total mass inside @xmath3 .",
    "since the ( decontracted ) average halo density scales with the mean density of the universe at the assembly epoch , we derived the dark - halo assembly redshift @xmath19 for coma ( ( * ? ? ? * thomas et al .",
    "2011 ) ) and abell  262 galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wegner et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "we compared the values of @xmath19 to the star - formation redshifts @xmath37 calculated from the stellar - population ages .",
    "for the majority of galaxies @xmath38 and their assembly seems to have stopped before @xmath20 .",
    "the stars of some galaxies appear to be younger than the halo , which indicates a secondary star - formation episode after the main halo assembly .",
    "the photometric and kinematic properties of the remaining galaxies suggest they are the remnants of gas - poor binary mergers and their progenitors formed close to the @xmath39 relation . without trying to overinterpret the result given the assumptions , it seems that kroupa imf allows us to explain the formation redshifts of our galaxies .",
    "in addition , galaxies in coma and abell  262 where the dynamical mass that follows the light is in excess of a kroupa stellar population do not differ in terms of their stellar population ages , metallicities and @xmath0-elements abundances from galaxies where this is not the case .",
    "taken at face value , our dynamical mass models are therefore as consistent with a universal imf , as they are with a variable imf . if the imf indeed varies from galaxy to galaxy according to the average star - formation rate ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conroy & van dokkum 2012 ) ) then the assumption of a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio _ inside _ a galaxy should be relaxed in future dynamical and lensing models ."
