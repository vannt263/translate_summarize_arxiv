    "here we formulate our main result in the context of measurable spaces .",
    "two main cases are of interest : when the space of ontic states @xmath18 is discrete , and when it is absolutely continuous . the discrete case was treated in the main text .",
    "it has the advantage of notational simplicity , but is probably difficult to justify as it is known that reproducing the predictions of quantum theory requires that the space of ontic states @xmath18 be continuous @xcite .",
    "the absolutely continuous case is more natural , but the notation and proofs are slightly more cumbersome . in the following we first introduce a general measure theoretic framework for ontic states , and",
    "then restrict to the absolutely continuous case .",
    "the state space @xmath18 is assumed to be a ( probability ) measure space with a fixed @xmath103-algebra @xmath104 of events .",
    "we assume the existence of a reference measure @xmath105 on @xmath18 . for a measurable set @xmath106 , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the indicator function for @xmath109 ( 1 on @xmath109 and 0 elsewhere ) .",
    "each preparation @xmath2 induces a conditional probability measure @xmath110 defined on @xmath104 . from the lebesgue decomposition theorem @xcite",
    "we infer that the measure @xmath110 can be decomposed as @xmath111 where the measures @xmath112 and @xmath113 are respectively singular and absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath105 .",
    "recall that a measure @xmath114 is concentrated on a set @xmath115 if for any measurable set @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and that two measures are singular with respect to each other if they are concentrated on disjoint sets .",
    "furthermore the singular part @xmath112 can be decomposed into a discrete singular part which consists of a sum of dirac measures ( `` @xmath17 functions '' ) and a singular continuous part .",
    "in the remainder we consider the case where @xmath110 only consists of an absolutely continuous part .",
    "this is the assumption that is generally made in the literature .",
    "the case where there is only a discrete singular part was discussed in the main text .",
    "note that our results can be extended to the case where either the absolutely continuous or the discrete singular part are non - zero .",
    "our results do not apply to the case where there is only a singular continuous part .",
    "we denote by @xmath118 the set on which @xmath105 is concentrated . the fact that the measure @xmath110 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath105 ( @xmath119 whenever @xmath120 ) implies that there is an @xmath105-measurable function @xmath121 on @xmath18 such that for all @xmath122 @xmath123 in integration theory the function @xmath121 is called the radon - nikodym derivative @xcite .",
    "we further suppose that the probability of obtaining result @xmath4 given measurement @xmath5 and ontic state @xmath1 is given by an @xmath105-measurable function @xmath124 .",
    "then we have @xmath125 we can define the support @xmath126 of the function @xmath121 as the complement of the set on which it vanishes . since @xmath127 there will be no loss of generality if we restrict the support to @xmath118 .",
    "( note that if the measure is not absolutely continuous , we can not introduce in general the concept of `` support '' of the measures @xmath110 as it requires a topology on @xmath18 which we do not assume ) .",
    "given the above framework , we now state and prove the results presented in the main text in the case of absolutely continuous measures .",
    "this includes the case where @xmath128 with @xmath105 the standard measure on @xmath129 .",
    "a statistical model is @xmath0-epistemic if there exist two preparation procedures @xmath130 and @xmath131 giving two distinct quantum states such that @xmath132 .",
    "a @xmath0-epistemic model is @xmath17-continuous if , given the preparation q of the pure quantum state @xmath8 , there is a set @xmath133 ( which can depend on @xmath2 ) such that for all states @xmath134 satisfying @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . note that this implies that @xmath138 .",
    "a model is continuous , if it is @xmath17-continuous for some @xmath27 .",
    "why is @xmath17-continuity a `` natural '' condition ?",
    "informally the reason is that except in rare occasions physical quantities depend continuously on their parameters .",
    "discontinuities are generally attributable to mathematical idealisation . to illustrate this in the present case ,",
    "suppose that we can write @xmath139 , where @xmath8 is the pure state produced by @xmath2 , and @xmath12 are additional variables specifying the preparation .",
    "furthermore suppose that @xmath140 all belong to compact subsets of real euclidean space @xmath129 , and that the probability distribution @xmath141 is a continuous function of all its parameters .",
    "then it is uniformly continuous , and hence @xmath142continuous for some @xmath27 .",
    "let the dimension of the quantum state space be @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the same @xmath16 independent non - orthogonal states @xmath143 as in the main text .",
    "suppose the model is @xmath17-continuous for @xmath36 .",
    "then there exists a set @xmath144 for all @xmath37 with @xmath138 .",
    "define a new function @xmath145 .",
    "then we have @xmath146 it remains to show that @xmath147 is strictly positive . to this end",
    "we note that for each function @xmath148 there must be a positive integer @xmath149 such that the set @xmath150 satisfies @xmath151 .",
    "otherwise @xmath152 , contrary to our hypothesis .",
    "let @xmath153 .",
    "then for the set @xmath154 we have @xmath155 for all @xmath156 and hence @xmath157 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath158 we thus arrive at the contradiction @xmath159 .",
    "consider a preparation @xmath2 of a physical system and any subset of ontic states @xmath160 that occurs with non - zero probability @xmath161 .",
    "consider @xmath53 identical copies of the preparation devices , which when used yield preparation @xmath54 .",
    "then the product set @xmath162 occurs with non - zero probability : @xmath163 .",
    "note that according to this definition the space of ontic states for @xmath53 independent preparations may be larger than the product @xmath164 .",
    "this does not affect the definition of separability .",
    "the proof of theorem 2 in the case of absolutely continuous measures is a simple combination of the arguments given in the main text in the case of discrete singular measures , and the proof of theorem 1 for the case of absolutely continuous measures .",
    "hardy recently proposed a no - go theorem for @xmath0-epistemic models for a single system that satisfies _ ontic indifference _ , or _ restricted ontic indifference _ ( see definitions below ) @xcite . here",
    "we show that ontic indifference is an extremely strong condition for @xmath0-epistemic models , since it implies that there are ontic states @xmath1 that are shared by all quantum states in the hilbert space .",
    "it is therefore immediately in contradiction with the predictions of quantum theory since this implies that orthogonal quantum states have overlapping ontic distributions .",
    "restricted ontic indifference does not suffer from this problem , but on the other hand it breaks the unitary invariance of hilbert space by promoting one state to a specific status .",
    "we show how the proof methods we use to rule out @xmath17-continuous @xmath0-epistemic models can be easily transposed to provide no - go results for @xmath0-epistemic models obeying restricted ontic indifference .    any quantum transformation on a system which leaves unchanged any given pure state , @xmath165 , can be performed in such a way that it does not affect the underlying ontic states @xmath166 in the ontic support of that pure state . by the ontic support of a given state , @xmath165 ,",
    "one means the set @xmath167 of ontic states @xmath1 which might be prepared when the given pure state is prepared .",
    "ontic indifference implies the following fact : if two distinct states @xmath168 share the same ontic state @xmath1 , that is @xmath166 and @xmath169 , and if @xmath73 is a unitary transformation that leaves @xmath165 invariant , @xmath170 , then @xmath171 belongs to the ontic support of @xmath172 .",
    "this follows from considering the following 4 preparations : a specific preparation @xmath173 of @xmath165 , the preparation @xmath173 followed by unitary @xmath73 ( that leaves @xmath165 invariant ) , a specific preparation @xmath174 of @xmath175 , and the preparation @xmath174 followed by unitary @xmath73 ( which prepares @xmath172 ) .",
    "then we note that preparation @xmath173 sometimes yields the ontic state @xmath1 , that @xmath73 leaves @xmath1 invariant , that preparation @xmath174 sometimes yields the ontic state @xmath1 , hence preparation @xmath174 followed by @xmath73 sometimes yields the ontic state @xmath1 , and therefore @xmath171 .",
    "this observation has the following consequence , which implies directly that no @xmath0-epistemic model can reproduce the predictions of quantum theory ( since it implies in particular that orthogonal quantum states share a common real state @xmath1 ) .    if any two distinct states @xmath176 share the same ontic state @xmath1 , that is @xmath177 and @xmath178 , and if ontic indifference holds , then all states in the hilbert space share the ontic state @xmath1 , that is @xmath166 for all @xmath165 .",
    "to prove this consider the following sets @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) of states , where @xmath181 and @xmath182 there exist @xmath183 and a unitary @xmath73 such that @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "that is , @xmath179 is the set of states that can be obtained from @xmath186 by a unitary that leaves one of the states in @xmath186 invariant .    by hypothesis , both states in @xmath187 share the same ontic state @xmath1 .",
    "hence by the above observation , all states in @xmath188 for all @xmath189 , also share the state @xmath1 . now consider the case of a 2-dimensional hilbert space . if @xmath190 are at an angle @xmath191 from each other ( as measured on the bloch sphere ) , then it is easy to show ( just draw the successive sets @xmath192 that the size of @xmath179 increases exponentially , such that when @xmath193 , @xmath179 comprises the whole bloch sphere .",
    "the case of a 2-dimensional hilbert space helps to visualize what is happening , but is not a restriction , since the linear span of the set @xmath194 is the whole hilbert space .      any quantum transformation on a system which leaves unchanged the pure state @xmath165 can be performed in such a way that it does not affect the underlying ontic states , @xmath166 , in the ontic support of that pure state .",
    "the quantum predictions are incompatible with @xmath0-epistemic models satisfying the assumptions of restricted ontic indifference and separability , and such that there exists a state @xmath195 sharing a common ontic state @xmath1 with @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the particular state in the definition of restricted ontic indifference .",
    "let @xmath196 be an integer such that @xmath197 .",
    "add an ancilla @xmath198 to the space such that the dimension of the full hilbert space is greater or equal to @xmath16 . by the assumption of separability the states @xmath199 and @xmath200 share a common ontic state @xmath1 .",
    "choose a basis such that @xmath201 , and coefficients @xmath202 , @xmath203 such that @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 ( this is always possible since @xmath207 ) .",
    "define the states @xmath208 .",
    "( note that these states coincide with the states @xmath209 used in the main text if @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) .",
    "the observation above implies that all the states @xmath212 share the ontic state @xmath1 , since @xmath213 . we then obtain a contradiction with the predictions of quantum theory exactly as in the proof of theorem  1 given in the main text .",

    "<S> a major reason for doubting the reality of the quantum state is that it can not be observed directly : it can only be reconstructed indirectly by lengthy state estimation procedures @xcite . furthermore , an epistemic interpretation of the quantum state could provide an intuitive explanation for many counterintuitive quantum phenomena and paradoxes , such as the measurement postulate and wavefunction collapse @xcite .    to formulate with precision the above question , </S>",
    "<S> we assume , following @xcite , that every quantum system possesses a real physical state ( also called ontic state ) , denoted @xmath1 , which is independent of the observer . </S>",
    "<S> when a measurement is performed on the system , the probabilities to get different outcomes are determined by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if an ensemble of such systems is prepared , different members of the ensemble may be found in different states @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a preparation procedure @xmath2 therefore corresponds in general to a probability distribution @xmath3 over the real states . </S>",
    "<S> the probability to obtain the outcome @xmath4 when preparation @xmath2 is followed by measurement @xmath5 is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> such a model will reproduce the quantum predictions if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the quantum state assigned by quantum theory to the preparation @xmath2 and @xmath9 is the quantum operator describing the measurement .    </S>",

    "<S> a model is said to be @xmath0__-ontic _ _ if the preparation of distinct pure quantum states always give rise to distinct real states . </S>",

    "<S> the quantum state is `` encoded '' in @xmath1 and we can consider it to represent a real property of the system , akin , e.g. , to the total energy of a system in classical physics @xcite . in the second class of models , known as @xmath0__-epistemic _ _ models , preparation of distinct pure quantum states may result in the same real state @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> we derive two alternative no - go theorems for @xmath0-epistemic models based on a natural assumption of continuity . </S>",
    "<S> our approach shows that already at the level of a single system there exist strong constraints on @xmath0-epistemic models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our first no - go theorem readily translates in a simple experimental test , an implementation of which has been reported in @xcite using high - dimensional attenuated coherent states of light traveling in an optical fibre .    </S>",
    "<S> constraints on @xmath0-epistemic models at the level of single quantum systems have also been obtained in @xcite using an assumption termed _ </S>",
    "<S> ontic indifference_. this assumption is in fact closely related to the one presented here . in section 2 of the supplemental material  @xcite , we show how to use our approach to recover , in a simple and clear way , those of @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> _ the key motivation behind our result is that @xmath0-epistemic models should satisfy a form of continuity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we assign an ontic status to @xmath0 if a variation of @xmath0 necessarily implies a variation of the underlying reality @xmath1 , and we assign it an epistemic status if a variation of @xmath0 does not necessarily imply a variation of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is then natural to assume a form of continuity for @xmath0-epistemic models : a slight change of @xmath0 induces a slight change in the corresponding ensemble of @xmath1 s in such a way that at least some @xmath1 s from the initial ensemble will also belong to the perturbed ensemble . </S>",

    "<S> it is easily checked that these states are normalised @xmath63 , have mutual scalar product @xmath64^{1/n}$ ] for @xmath65 , and are all at distance @xmath66 from the state @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . in a @xmath69-continuous model , </S>",
    "<S> these states share at least a common real state @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the separability assumption then implies that the states @xmath59 also share a common real state , and thus that @xmath70 . by the same argument as in theorem  1 </S>",
    "<S> , it then follows that if a measurement @xmath5 yielding one of the possible outcomes @xmath41 is performed on each of these systems , the quantity @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> note now that the @xmath16 @xmath53-fold copies @xmath59 are normalised and have mutual scalar product @xmath72 for @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> there therefore exists a unitary transformation @xmath73 in the subspace @xmath74 spanned by the @xmath16 states @xmath59 that carries out the transformation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 for some basis @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath38 are identical to the states used in the proof of theorem  1 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that there exists a @xmath16-outcome measurement @xmath5 in @xmath77 which applied on the states @xmath59 gives the same statistics as the measurement in the basis @xmath49 applied on the states @xmath38 of theorem 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore find a measurement such that @xmath78 and thus @xmath79 in contradiction with the prediction of a @xmath69-continuous separable @xmath0-epistemic model .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus shown that one can exclude @xmath17-continuous separable models with @xmath80 for any positive integers @xmath16 and @xmath53 . for large @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> this bound behaves as @xmath81 , with @xmath82/(2d)$ ] , thereby implying by taking @xmath53 arbitrarily large that no @xmath0-epistemic model for hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath83 can satisfy both the assumptions of continuity and separability .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare how these no - go theorems could be used in practice to test @xmath0-epistemic models ( see @xcite for actual tests ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental tests that rule out @xmath0-epistemic models for smaller values of the continuity parameter @xmath17 are clearly stronger . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider how resources scales as @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the construction of theorem 1 , then we need to use systems of dimension @xmath85 , and the resources needed to test @xmath0-epistemic models increase as @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> if we use theorem 2 , and take e.g. the dimension @xmath52 , then one needs to prepare three states @xmath87 , where the number of copies of each state is @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> again the resources needed increase as @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we could also test @xmath17-continuous @xmath0-epistemic models using the construction given in pbr @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we need to prepare @xmath89 distinct states , each of which is a product state of @xmath53 qubits , with @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the resources required for the application of the pbr construction therefore grow exponentially in @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental tests based on theorems 1 and 2 thus seem much easier than those based on the pbr construction .    </S>",
    "<S> note that our theoretical arguments and pbr s one rely on the fact that certain quantum probabilities are exactly equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , these arguments are robust against small deviations from these predictions , as expected in an experimental implementation where noise is inevitably present . indeed , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nogo ] ) implies that the observed value @xmath92 provides an upper bound on the overlap @xmath93 of the ontic distributions @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> a small value of @xmath94 therefore translates into a strong constraint on continuous @xmath0-epistemic models , since it implies that these distributions have only a small common overlap . </S>",
    "<S> similarly @xmath95 in theorem  2 upper bounds the overlap @xmath96 of the @xmath53-copy joint distributions @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this last quantity can simply be related to the single - copy overlap @xmath98 if we further make the preparation independence assumption of pbr that joint distributions @xmath99 are product of individual distributions , which then implies @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> note that a comparison of the sensitivity of the different tests to experimental noise is possible , but goes beyond the scope of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> it would require a detailed modeling of the state preparation and measurement procedures .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion . </S>",
    "<S> _ in his seminal paper on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory , born gave the wavefunction a functional interpretation : a mathematical object from which the probabilities of different measurement outcomes can be determined @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the fundamental nature of this object , a real physical wave or a summary of our knowledge about physical systems , is a question that has divided physicists ever since . </S>",
    "<S> a precise formulation of these two alternatives , opening the way to clear - cut answers , was provided by harrigan and spekkens @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the wavefunction corresponds to a real , ontic , property of physical systems , the preparation of a system in different pure quantum states should always result in different physical states . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , the wavefunction has an epistemic status , such preparations should sometimes result in the same underlying physical state . </S>",
    "<S> pbr have recently introduced a no - go theorem that , given certain assumptions , rules out this latter possibility @xcite , thus awarding ontic status to the wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> this result can also be seen as a constraint on the structure of possible extensions or generalizations of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> if they reproduce the quantum predictions and satisfy these assumptions , then such theories can only _ supplement _ the wavefunction @xmath0 with additional variables @xmath101 , i.e. , a system should be described by a physical state of the form @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> the theorem of pbr relies on two main assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> the first , which is also unquestioned in the present work , is that a system has a real and objective state @xmath1 that is independent of the observer . </S>",
    "<S> the second is an assumption of  preparation independence \" , which states that independently prepared systems are described by independent product distributions over real states . </S>",
    "<S> it can be replaced by the weaker separability assumption used here .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we reached the same conclusion as pbr using a simple argument that relies on a natural assumption of continuity . </S>",
    "<S> this notion of continuity captures the intuition that in a model where the quantum state is epistemic , a small variation of @xmath0 does not necessarily imply a variation of the underlying real state @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a fundamental limit on the degree of continuity of @xmath0-epistemic models , as parametrized by a quantity @xmath17 , already at the level of single quantum systems ( theorem  1 ) . combining our continuity assumption with a separability assumption </S>",
    "<S> , we then showed that no @xmath0-epistemic model can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory ( theorem  2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> besides their simplicity and the fact that they already constrain @xmath0-epistemic models for single quantum systems , an interest of our results is that they are easy to implement experimentally . </S>",
