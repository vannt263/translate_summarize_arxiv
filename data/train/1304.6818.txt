    "introduced more than thirty years ago , surface acoustic wave ( saw ) devices have been used with great success by the telecommunication industry : nowadays , they are produced in large quantities ( several billions per year ) and used in wireless transmission and reception technology for color television sets , cell phones , global positioning systems , etc . in recent years ,",
    "new applications for saw devices have emerged , namely acoustic sensors , which are passive ( no power supply is needed ) , resistant , almost non - aging , cheap ( only one photo - lithographic process is involved in the production ) , light ( less than 1 g ) and can be operated remotely and wirelessly .",
    "for instance @xcite saw identification tags are used for highway toll collection in norway and for the munich subway system ; saw temperature sensors can achieve a resolution of 0.02@xmath0c from @xmath1c up to @xmath2c ; wide ranges and fine resolutions are also achieved for pressure , torque , or current sensors ; etc .",
    "also , the automotive industry is engaged in the search for an `` intelligent tire '' which could provide direct information on its current state as the car is moving ; in this context saw sensors have been used to measure tire pressure @xcite or friction @xcite as the wheel rotates . in general , saw devices may be used as angular rate sensors ( gyroscopes ) to measure frequency shifts due to the rotation @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "an investigation of the effect of rotation upon the speed of surface ( rayleigh ) waves in an anisotropic crystal is presented .",
    "the crystal may possess as little as a single plane of symmetry .",
    "it is cut along any plane containing the normal to the symmetry plane and is assumed to rotate at a constant rate about this normal .",
    "the surface wave is polarized in the symmetry plane .",
    "in other words , it suffices to consider the propagation of a surface wave in the @xmath3 direction of a monoclinic crystal with symmetry plane at @xmath4 , cut along the @xmath5 plane , and rotating about the @xmath6-axis ( see fig .",
    "the secular equation for rotating materials was obtained by others but in simpler settings : by clarke and burdess in an isotropic material , first for small rotation rate / wave frequency ratios @xcite , then for any ratio @xcite ; by grigorevski , gulyaev , and kozlov @xcite also for isotropic materials but neglecting the centrifugal force ; and by fang , yang , and jiang @xcite for crystals having tetragonal symmetry . here",
    ", the analysis is fully developed for crystals with a single symmetry plane , up to the derivation of the secular equation in explicit form , that is an equation giving the rayleigh wave speed in terms of the elastic parameters and of the rotation rate .",
    "the equation is reached in section 3 , after the governing equations have been written down in section 2 .",
    "the secular equation turns out to be a polynomial of degree 8 for the squared wave speed and also for the squared rotation rate / wave frequency ratio . in the simpler case of orthorhombic symmetry ( section 4 ) ,",
    "the polynomial is of degree 6 .",
    "the rayleigh wave speed is computed numerically for 20 specific anisotropic materials ( 12 monoclinic , 8 orthorhombic ) and for a rotation rate / wave frequency ratio varying from 0 to 10 .",
    "of course , this range is way beyond the elastic behavior limit , and is irrealistic for pratical purposes where the frequency of a saw device is typically in the 100khz-10mhz range .",
    "it is presented to show that the method of resolution is exact and not approximate , applies for any rate of rotation , and that in contrast with the non - rotating case , the secular equation is dispersive . at small rotation rates , and for certain crystals such as pzt-5 , other papers @xcite show that the rayleigh wave speed may at first increase slightly with the rotation frequency / wave frequency ratio . at large ratios , it is seen here that the wave speed decreases with increasing ratios .",
    "these variations are crucial to the understanding and correct design of rotating saw sensors or saw signal processing devices .",
    "a recent article @xcite describes the manufacturing of a 1 cm @xmath7 1 cm saw gyroscope and how the rotation rate may be measured using saw technology .",
    "another example that springs to mind is that of `` spinning missiles '' @xcite for which it is reasonnable to speculate that the communication is ensured via saw generation and processing of high - frequency signals modified by the rotation . finally in section 5",
    ", the merits of several methods of derivation for the secular equation in non - rotating crystals are discussed .",
    "this paper aims to provide a theoretical and analytical framework for the study of surface acoustic waves in rotating crystals .",
    "we consider a half - space @xmath8 occupied by a homogeneous anisotropic crystal possessing one plane of symmetry at @xmath4 , and rotating at a constant angular velocity @xmath9 about the @xmath6-axis .",
    "we study the propagation of a surface ( rayleigh ) wave in the @xmath3-direction , with attenuation in the @xmath10-direction . in the rotating cartesian frame @xmath11 ,",
    "the equations of motion are @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cauchy stress tensor , @xmath14 is the constant mass density of the material , and the comma denotes differentiation . the second term in the right hand - side of eq .",
    "is due to the coriolis acceleration , the third is due to the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "note that eq . represents the time-_dependent _ part of the full equations of motion .",
    "the time-_independent _ part , namely * div * @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 must be solved separately .",
    "the questions remain of ( a ) whether an actual time - independent solution exists for all @xmath9 and if it does , of ( b ) whether the boundary conditions of a traction - free rotating half - space may be satisfied without perturbating the time - dependent boundary value problem .",
    "these questions do not seem to have been addressed in the literature , but some preliminary work seem however to suggest that ( a ) and ( b ) may be answered positively , at least within the framework of small amplitude waves superimposed upon a large elastic deformation .",
    "now , turning back to the time - dependent equations , the mechanical displacement @xmath18 is taken in the form @xmath19 showing a sinusoidal propagation with speed @xmath20 and wave number @xmath21 in the @xmath3-direction , and the possibility of an attenuation in the @xmath10-direction through the unknown function @xmath22 .",
    "we wish to describe the influence of the frame rotation upon the speed of rayleigh waves , and to this end , we introduce the following quantities , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the real frequency of the wave .    for two - dimensional motions ( @xmath25 ) such as eq .",
    ", the anisotropy of a crystal possessing @xmath4 as a symmetry plane is described by the following strain - stress relationship @xcite : @xmath26 where the strain components @xmath27 are defined in terms of the displacement components by : @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 are the reduced compliances .",
    "alternatively , the equivalent strain - stress relations can be used @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31^\\text{t}$ ] , @xmath32^\\text{t}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath33 are elements , in the voigt notation , of the fourth - order elastic stiffness tensor @xmath34 .",
    "table 1 shows the relevant reduced compliances of 12 different monoclinic crystals , computed from the corresponding stiffnesses as collected by chadwick and wilson @xcite ; the last column gives the corresponding rayleigh wave speed in the non - rotating case @xcite .    in view of the form eq . for the displacement , we introduce the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 for the tractions @xmath37 , @xmath38 on the planes @xmath10=const . as , @xmath39 then , substituting eqs . and into the equations of motion , we derive the following system of linear first - order differential equations for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath42 where @xmath43^{\\mathrm{t}}$ ] , @xmath44^{\\mathrm{t}}$ ] , and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "note that , as in the static case @xcite , the anti - plane strain ( stress ) decouples from the plane strain ( stress ) and need not be considered for this problem . this decoupling would not occur if the the crystal was rotating about the @xmath3-axis or the @xmath10-axis @xcite .",
    "the surface @xmath5 is free of tractions and so , the boundary conditions are @xmath46    in eq . , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the same as the @xmath49 submatrices of the @xmath50 fundamental elasticity matrix @xmath51 from ingebrigsten and tonning @xcite .",
    "their real matrix @xmath52 however has been modified by the introduction of off - diagonal pure imaginary terms .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath53 where the quantities @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are given in terms of the elastic parameters as @xcite @xmath60 thus the rotation of the crystal perturbs the equations of motion in three ways : the introduction of dispersion through @xmath61 ; a shift of magnitude @xmath62 in @xmath63 for the lower left submatrix of @xmath51 proportional to the @xmath49 unit matrix ; and the modification of @xmath52 , which is diagonal in the non - rotating case ( note that the new matrix @xmath64 is hermitian : @xmath65 . ) despite these modifications , the secular equation can be obtained explicitly for the surface wave speed , using a method proposed by currie @xcite and by taziev @xcite for non - rotating anisotropic crystals with and without a plane of symmetry , respectively .",
    "the method of the polarization vector was first presented by currie @xcite to derive the secular equation for rayleigh waves in the symmetry plane of monoclinic non - rotating crystals . then taziev @xcite generalized the method to triclinic ( no symmetry plane ) crystals .",
    "this method takes advantage of the cayley - hamilton theorem for the fundamental matrix @xmath51 , which implies that only @xmath66 matrices @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are linearly independent ( @xmath69 for monoclinic crystals , @xmath70 for triclinic crystals ) .",
    "currie used the matrices @xmath51 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ; taziev , the matrices @xmath51 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 . recently ,",
    "ting @xcite placed their results within the context of the stroh - barnett - lothe formalism and improved on them by showing that the choices of @xmath75 , @xmath51 , @xmath71 for monoclinic crystals and of @xmath76 , @xmath75 , @xmath51 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 for triclinic crystals lead to simpler and more explicit secular equations .",
    "his approach is now adapted to our present context of a rotating crystal with one symmetry plane .",
    "an alternative derivation , not based on the stroh - barnett - lothe formalism , is available elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we seek solutions to the equations of motion eq . presenting exponential decay with distance @xmath77 where the constant vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 are related through @xcite : @xmath80 .",
    "then the equations of motion eq . give @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 matrix in eq .. this eigenvalue problem yields a quartic for @xmath84 .",
    "we limit our investigation to the subsonic range , defined as the greatest interval of values for @xmath20 where the determinant of @xmath85 possesses two roots @xmath86 , @xmath87 , with positive imaginary parts .",
    "we call @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 corresponding to each root",
    ". then the solution is of the form @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 $ ] , @xmath94 $ ] , and @xmath95 is a constant vector . using the boundary conditions eq . , we have at the free surface @xmath5 , @xmath96 moreover , the matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 satisfy the orthogonality condition @xcite , @xmath99    now , the eigenrelation eq .",
    "may be generalized for any positive or negative integer @xmath66 as @xmath100 explicitly , the elements of @xmath101 are computed by multiplication of @xmath82 or its inverse by itself .",
    "for instance , @xmath102 for @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 , @xmath105/s^{'2}_{11 } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\check{k}^{(2)}_{12 }   = [ 1-(s'_{11}-s'_{12})(1+\\delta^2)x - 2is'_{16}\\delta x]/s'_{11 } ,    = \\overline{\\check{k}^{(2)}_{21 } } ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "& \\check{k}^{(2)}_{22 } = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath106x / d ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\check{k}^{(-1)}_{12 }   = [ s'_{26}(1+\\delta^2 ) + 2is'_{12}\\delta         + ( s'_{12}s'_{16}-s'_{11}s'_{26})(1-\\delta^2)^2x]x / d   = \\overline{\\check{k}^{(-1)}_{21 } } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\check{k}^{(-1)}_{22 } =   [ 1- ( s'_{11}+s'_{66})(1+\\delta^2)x         + ( s'_{11}s'_{66}-s^{'2}_{16})(1-\\delta^2)^2 x^2]/d , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is a real denominator common to the @xmath108 whose expression is too long to reproduce and which turns out to be irrelevant for the derivation of the secular equation .",
    "now we write in turn the second vector line of eq.@xmath109 for @xmath86 and for @xmath87 , and deduce @xmath110 multiplying this equality to the left by @xmath111 and to the right by @xmath95 , and using eqs .",
    ", , we conclude that ( see @xcite for the non - rotating case ) , @xmath112 at @xmath113 , and @xmath114^\\text{t}$ ] ( say ) , three equations follow : @xmath115 we re - arrange this system as : @xmath116 , by introducing the following quantities , @xmath117 note that the explicit expressions for the non - dimensional quantities @xmath118 and @xmath119 in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath120 , and the @xmath29 are easily read off eqs . , .",
    "for instance , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and so on .    the linear non - homogeneous system @xmath124 has a unique solution for @xmath125 .",
    "introducing @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) , the determinant of the matrix obtained from @xmath129 by replacing its @xmath21-th column with @xmath130 , we write the solution as @xmath131 .",
    "but the components of @xmath125 are related one to another through @xmath132 .",
    "this relation is the _ explicit secular equation for rayleigh waves on an anisotropic crystal rotating in its plane of symmetry _",
    ", @xmath133    this equation is a polynomial of degree 8 in @xmath63 , and also of degree 8 in @xmath62 . because @xmath134 appears only in even powers in the secular equation , the rayleigh speed obtained as a root of eq .",
    "does not depend on the sense of rotation .",
    "numerically , we find that the rotation slows the rayleigh wave down and that the speed is a monotone decreasing function of @xmath61 .",
    "we see this behavior on fig .",
    "2 , where the dependence of the rayleigh wave speed upon @xmath61 is shown for the 12 monoclinic crystals from table 1 .",
    "the curves are arranged in the same order as in the table , from the slowest ( diphenyl , starting at 1276 m / s ) to the fastest ( diallage , starting at 4000 m / s ) .",
    "the secular equation is valid for any crystal possessing at least one plane of symmetry , as long as the half - space is cut along a plane containing the normal to the plane of symmetry . in particular , it is also valid for orthorhombic crystals when the plane of cut contains one of the crystallographic axes .",
    "when this plane contains two crystallographic axes , the secular equation factorizes and a separate treatment is required .",
    "when the material possesses three orthogonal planes of symmetry and the axes ( @xmath135 ) are aligned with the crystallographic axes , some compliances vanish : @xmath136 .",
    "table 2 lists the values of the relevant reduced compliances for 8 rhombic crystals , computed from the corresponding values of the stiffnesses as collected by shutilov @xcite .",
    "the corresponding rayleigh wave speed @xmath137 in the non - rotating case ( last column ) is found from the exact secular equation @xcite , @xmath138 }              = 0.\\ ] ]    when the frame is rotating , the system @xmath124 reduces to @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141x , \\quad h_2 = 1 - s'_{11}(1+\\delta^2)x . \\end{array}\\ ] ] from this new system of equations , we deduce that @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and also that @xmath145 , implying that @xmath146 , @xmath147 as well .",
    "this last equality is the _ explicit secular equation for rayleigh waves on an orthorhombic crystal rotating in one plane of symmetry _ , @xmath148    this equation is a polynomial of degree 6 in @xmath63 and in @xmath120 . as in the monoclinic case above , the roots are even functions of @xmath61 . numerically , the results are similar to those of the monoclinic case , as fig .",
    "3 shows for the eight orthorhombic crystals of table 2 .",
    "again , the curves are arranged in the same order as in the table , from the slowest ( sulfur , starting at 1628 m / s ) to the fastest ( benzophenone , starting at 4723 m / s ) .",
    "several methods have been proposed to derive explicitly the secular equation for surface waves in non - rotating monoclinic crystals with the plane of symmetry at @xmath4 .",
    "this author @xcite wrote the equations of motion as a system of two second - order differential equations for the tractions @xmath149 : @xmath150 , where , , are @xmath49 real symmetric matrices .",
    "then the method of first integrals @xcite yields the secular equation .",
    "the equations of motion eq . may also be written in a similar manner for a rotating crystal , but , , become complex and the method of first integrals is no longer applicable as such .",
    "next , ting @xcite assumed an exponential form for @xmath151 and obtained the secular equation through some simple algebraic manipulations , taking advantage of the fact that @xmath152 ; in the rotating case however , these quantities are no longer zero .",
    "furs @xcite ( using the displacement field ) and this author @xcite ( using the traction field ) devised yet another method , where the secular equation is the resultant of two polynomials ; again , having real quantities for the components of @xmath51 is a crucial property , no longer true for rotating crystals .",
    "all in all , it seems that the method of the polarization vector is the most appropriate for the case of a rotating crystal .",
    "note that a simple derivation of its main result , not relying on the stroh formalism , was presented recently @xcite .",
