    "linear colliders offer unique opportunities to study photon - photon collisions obtained using the process of compton backscattering of laser light off electron beams from the linear collider @xcite .",
    "this option is included now in conceptual design reports of the nlc , jlc and tesla / sblc projects @xcite .",
    "the expected physics at the photon linear collider ( plc ) is very rich and complementary to that in @xmath3 collisions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .    without the discovery of a light higgs boson at lep2 , lhc or the linear collider , the best strategy to probe the symmetry breaking sector would lie in the study of the self couplings of the @xmath2 , @xmath4 bosons .",
    "the large cross sections for the processes involving @xmath2 s make @xmath5 colliders especially attractive tool in probing the @xmath2 self couplings .",
    "indeed , the reaction @xmath6 would be the dominant source of the @xmath1 pairs at future linear colliders , provided that photon - photon collider option will be realized .",
    "the born cross section of @xmath1 pair production in photon - photon collisions in the scattering angle interval @xmath7 is 61  pb at @xmath8  gev and 37  pb at 1  tev .",
    "corresponding cross sections of @xmath1 pair production in @xmath3 collisions are an order of magnitude smaller : 6.6  pb at 500  gev and 2.5  pb at 1  tev . with more than a million @xmath9 pairs per year a photon - photon collider",
    "can be really considered as a @xmath2-factory and an ideal place to conduct precision tests on the anomalous triple @xcite and quartic @xcite couplings of the @xmath2 bosons .",
    "in addition , in the process of triple @xmath10 vector boson production it is possible to probe the tri - linear @xmath11 and quartic couplings @xcite as well as the @xmath12 violating anomalous @xmath11 , @xmath13 interactions @xcite .    with the natural order of magnitude on anomalous couplings one needs to know the @xmath14 cross sections with a precision better than 1% to extract these small numbers . from a theoretical point of view",
    "this calls for the very careful analysis of at least @xmath15 corrections to the cross section of @xmath1 pair production in @xmath5 collisions , which were recently calculated including virtual corrections @xcite and complete @xmath15 corrections taking into account both virtual one - loop corrections and real photon and @xmath4-boson emission @xcite .",
    "inclusive cross section of @xmath1 pair production in photon - photon collisions to third order in @xmath16 is given by the ir - finite sum of born cross section , interference term between the born and one - loop amplitudes and cross section of @xmath1 pair production accompanied by the real photon emission . at energies above the @xmath10 threshold one should add the cross section of @xmath17 production .",
    "@xmath18    in contrast to the corrections to the @xmath4 boson production at lep1 , as a consequence of the universality of the electric charge no power or logarithmically enhanced corrections involving @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 appear in the on - shell scheme in the limit , when higgs - boson or top - quark masses are much larger than the collision energy or the fermion mass @xmath24 is much smaller than @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows total cross section of @xmath9 pair production summed over @xmath9 and @xmath26 final states and integrated over @xmath27 scattering angles in the interval @xmath28 as a function of energy for various polarizations . the bulk of the cross section originates from transverse @xmath29 pair production .",
    "transverse @xmath2 s are produced predominantly in the forward / backward direction and the helicity conserving amplitudes are dominating .",
    "cross sections integrated over the whole phase space are non - decreasing with energy . for a finite angular cutoff they do decrease as @xmath30 , but still they are much larger than suppressed cross sections . for the dominating @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 helicity configurations corrections are negative and they rise with energy ranging from @xmath34 at 500  gev to @xmath35 at 2  tev .",
    "the correction for the next to the largest cross section @xmath36 is also negative . for the other helicities radiative corrections are positive at high energies due to dominating positive contribution of real photon emission .",
    "radiative corrections to cross sections @xmath37 , which are decreasing at born level as @xmath38 , are positive and large . for the cross sections @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are decreasing as @xmath41 for a finite angular cutoff , corrections are even larger .",
    "the cross section @xmath42 is decreasing at tree level as @xmath43 for a finite angular cutoff and is quite negligible at high energy .",
    "the cross sections @xmath44 and @xmath45 vanish at the born level , so only the process of @xmath26 production contributes in figure  1 .",
    "the cross sections @xmath42 and @xmath39 exhibit a clear clear higgs resonance peak and the interference pattern , respectively , at @xmath46  gev .",
    "( 5.4,3 ) ( -.1,0 ) ( 2.7,0 )    .unpolarized born cross sections and relative corrections for various intervals of @xmath27 scattering angles .",
    "corrections originating from real hard photon ( @xmath47  gev ) and @xmath4-boson emission as well as sum of soft photon and virtual boson contributions , fermion virtual corrections and total corrections are given separately .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  1 born cross sections and relative corrections are given for several intervals of @xmath27 scattering angles . at high energies",
    "large cancellations occur between negative virtual corrections and positive corrections corresponding to real photon or @xmath4-boson emission . consequently , although the correction originating from the @xmath10 production is completely negligible at @xmath48  tev , it is of the same order of magnitude as hard photon correction at 2  tev .",
    "although at @xmath49  gev corrections are quite small ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , depending on angular cuts , at tev energies the value of radiative corrections in the central region of @xmath1 production become quite large , so that corrections in the region @xmath52 are @xmath53 times larger than the corrections to the total cross section at @xmath54  tev .",
    "they range from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "thus if precision measurements are to be made at tev energy more careful theoretical analysis is needed in order to reliably predict the value of the cross section in the central region where the value of the cross section is the most sensitive to the @xmath2 anomalous couplings .",
    "although the cross section of @xmath9 production is much larger in @xmath5 collisions , this fact itself is not to be considered as an obvious advantage of plc .",
    "the reason is that although the anomalous contribution to the amplitude of longitudinal @xmath57 pair production is enhanced by a factor of @xmath58 both in  for @xmath59 ( for @xmath60 in @xmath5 collisions anomalous coupling contribution is not enhanced at all ) and @xmath61 collisions , the @xmath14 born amplitude of @xmath57 production at plc is suppressed as @xmath62 , so that the contribution of the interference term to the cross section is decreasing as @xmath30 at plc @xcite . on the contrary , in @xmath61 collisions",
    "the anomalous contribution to the cross section is enhanced , corresponding to non - decreasing cross section of @xmath57 production .",
    "recently the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that enhanced coupling could still be exploited in the  mode .",
    "their clever idea is to reconstruct the non diagonal elements of the @xmath9 polarization density matrix by analyzing the distributions of the decay products of the @xmath2 s , thereby achieving the improvement over simple counting rate method of more that an order of magnitude at @xmath63  tev .",
    "however , although the benefits from  mode are really quite evident at @xmath64  gev and allowed region in the anomalous couplings parameter space shrinks considerably when results from @xmath65 are combined with ones from @xmath6 , at energies above 1  tev combining results from @xmath61 and  modes does not considerably reduce the bounds obtained from @xmath66 alone @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for fits with one anomalous coupling .",
    "qualitatively these results can be understood considering the ratio @xmath67 as a measure of statistical significance of the anomalous coupling signal @xmath68 with respect to the @xmath14 background @xmath69 . since the total @xmath14 cross section is decreasing as @xmath30 in @xmath61 collisions and",
    "is constant in  collisions , while the enhanced anomalous cross section behaves like a constant we get , while @xmath70 .",
    "if we take into account that anomalous couplings affect mostly the cross section in the central region , where the @xmath14 cross section behaves like @xmath71 , we get p_t ,  the same improvement at higher energy as for @xmath61 collisions but only for large values of @xmath72 cut @xmath73 , with which the cross section of @xmath9 production in  collisions is not enhanced any more with respect to production in @xmath61 collisions .",
    "moreover , it is this region , where radiative corrections are as large as @xmath74 .    to resume , at 500  gev linear collider much stronger constraints on the anomalous @xmath2 couplings",
    "could be obtained combining the bounds from @xmath66 and @xmath6 . at such an energy radiative corrections",
    "are well under control and photon - photon collider option is essential for precision measurements .    at energies above 1  tev , where enhancement factor @xmath58 for anomalous amplidudes starts playing a crucial role",
    ", plc is not so much advantageous with respect to @xmath3 collider at the same integrated lumonosity .",
    "radiative corrections are quite large and theoretical consideration beyond one - loop approximation is needed in order to safely predict @xmath14 cross section . nevertheless ,",
    "if in the photon - photon collisions one can obtain much larger luminosity than in @xmath3 collisions @xcite , the plc potential could still be as high as at lower energies .",
