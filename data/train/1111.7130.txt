    "dna origamis @xcite are formed in an annealing process where a long single stranded dna ( ssdna ) scaffold extracted from a virus ( m13mp18 ) is folded with the help of a set of @xmath0 short ssdna strands , called staples .",
    "the resulting structure has a typical size of 100 nm .",
    "locally , an origami is made of double stranded dna ( dsdna ) helices , where one of the strands corresponds to the scaffold .",
    "planar and 3d structures are obtained as the superposition of dna helices , with basically only one constraint : the staples should run from one helix to the other in such a way that mechanical deformations are minimized .",
    "this seemingly simple process has opened the way to the fabrication of a variety of nanostructures in 2d or 3d , acting as biosensors @xcite or nanorabots @xcite .",
    "dna origamis also provide with an easy tool to organize molecules such as proteins or carbon nanotubes @xcite at the nanometer scale .",
    "however , despite these innovative realisations , the folding process of dna origamis remains poorly understood .",
    "open questions include the exact role of the staple connectivity , the differences in yield for very similar origamis @xcite , or the factors that can influence the global stability of these nanostructures . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the process of formation of a dna origami can be analysed by collecting the fluorescence intensity of a reporter dye @xcite or by monitoring the variation of its uv absorption as a function of the temperature ( melting or annealing curve for , respectively , increasing or decreasing temperatures ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study in depth the process of formation of dna origamis through the analysis of melting and annealing curves obtained from uv absorption experiments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the formation of structures made of three ssdna ( called small origamis in the following ) .",
    "those can be considered as the building blocks of the usual dna origamis . in this section",
    ", we also give a short description of the experimental techniques and the interpretation of uv absorption data . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "the model describing the energetic cost associated with the local connectivity of origamis , and the modelling of the annealing - melting processes are presented .",
    "section 5 compares the melting curves of several dna origamis with those predicted by the model .",
    "the final section presents some concluding remarks . a short report of this modelling @xcite and a comparison between the model and experimental afm data @xcite have been published elsewhere .",
    "the basic mechanism in the formation of a dna origami is the hybridization of a staple to the scaffold . in this section",
    "we will consider very simple systems that help in the understanding of this basic process . in order to simplify the reasoning ,",
    "let us first consider the situation where one staple ( call it @xmath1 ) only binds to two separate parts of the scaffold ( in rothemund origamis , staples usually bind to three different parts of the scaffold ) .",
    "the binding to the scaffold necessarily proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , one of the two parts of the staple binds to the correct region of the scaffold : the zipping mechanism that ensures this binding is stopped by the existence of a noncomplementary region in the scaffold . at this stage ,",
    "half of the staple is bound to the scaffold , forming a stiff double helix .",
    "the remaining unbound parts of the scaffold and the staple form flexible coiled coil structures . fig . [ fig : simpleshema ] illustrates the two possible situations that can be found .",
    "when the staple is in the outer position , the coiled coil structures are on the same side of the double helix .",
    "this is usually called a bulge in the context of dna thermodynamics @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when the staple is in the inner position , the coiled coil structures are on opposite sides of this double helix .",
    "therefore , the probability that they merge is lower and the staple is expected to be much less stable in this position . in rothemund",
    "s origamis , both situations ( inner and outer ) are found . whereas the formation of a bulge ( outer position ) is well documented",
    ", it seems that the thermodynamics of the inner position binding has not been considered previously .",
    "this is why we decided to study the small origami structures .",
    "another important aspect in the folding of dna origamis is the interaction between staples . following the simple reasoning of the previous paragraph ,",
    "let us consider the influence of a second staple @xmath2 on the binding of @xmath1 .",
    "if the melting temperature of @xmath2 is higher than that of @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) , by the time @xmath1 starts binding , with high probability both parts of @xmath2 are bound to the scaffold , reducing its effective elasticity and/or length .",
    "this could in turn facilitate the binding of the second part of @xmath1 , resulting in some kind of cooperative behaviour .",
    "we designed a dna construction ( called small origami ) made of two ssdna 32b long ( staples ) and a 64b long ssdna ( scaffold ) .",
    "this structure is similar to dao structures@xcite and comparable in size and shape to jx and px structures which have already been studied experimentally @xcite , and theoretically @xcite , @xcite .",
    "three different sets of staples based on the same structure were chosen to quantitatively evidence cooperative effects during the binding of the staples . in the first two sets , the two staples ( b1 and b2 ) have very different compositions :",
    "the sequence of b1 only contains a or t nucleotide whereas b2 only contains g or c nucleotide .",
    "accordingly , their melting temperatures are far apart , respectively 57 @xmath4 and 91 @xmath4 .",
    "this allows to differentiate the two staples in the melting curve .",
    "the third set has two staples , b1 m and b2 m , designed with chemical sequences different enough to avoid mispairing with the 64b template b0 .",
    "they have close melting temperatures ( respectively 77 @xmath4 and 80 @xmath4 ) as their at / gc ratio are similar .",
    "the topology of the binding is illustrated in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simpleshema ] ) : each staple contains two contiguous parts , 32b long , that bind to the scaffold . in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simpleshema]a ) , b1 is in the outer position , b2 is in the inner position .",
    "it should be noted that besides the existence of an entropic hindrance , the inner position requires that double - helical domains stay in close contact , which could result in additional instability .",
    "motivated by the previous considerations , we have investigated three different cases :    * b2 is located in the inner part , b1 in the outer part . *",
    "b2 is located in the outer part , b1 in the inner part .",
    "* b1 m is located in the outer part , b2 m in the inner part .    for each of these three cases ,",
    "we have performed uv absorption measurements as a function of temperature .",
    "these measurements are based on the fact that hybridized bases absorb less than open bases : this is the so - called hyperchromic effect .",
    "the absorbance associated to any staple @xmath5 is :    @xmath6    in this equation , @xmath7 denotes the proportion of staples that are folded ( at temperature @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the absorbance of @xmath5 and @xmath10 the absorbance of its complementary staple , calculated according to @xcite .",
    "we used the following relation for the hypocromicity @xmath11 :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the fraction of gc content in the staple @xmath5 .",
    "this formula has been slightly modified from @xcite to improve the fit against the experimental data for the small origamis .",
    "the degree of pairing @xmath14 can be obtained from the raw absorbance measurements following the methods in @xcite .    in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]a ) we report the derivative of the melting curves @xmath14 that show the behaviour of the b1 strand for different configurations .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]a.a corresponds to the melting curve of b1 with its complementary @xmath15 : it shows a maximum peak at 57  @xmath4 and a half width of 4.5 k. we analyse first the case where b1 is outer . without the staple b2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]a.b ) , the structure produces a loop or bulge , as described in @xcite that introduces an entropic penalty and decreases the melting temperature to 48.5  @xmath4 and a half width of 6 k. thus the folding is much less robust .",
    "when b1 and b2 are both present two events appear on the melting curve .",
    "the first one at 83 @xmath4 ( not shown in fig .  [ fig : allsmall]a ) corresponding to the folding of b2 in the inner position . then",
    "fig .  [ fig : allsmall]a.c , b1 folds at a temperature higher than when it is alone , with a maximum peak at 51.5  @xmath4 but with a similar half width",
    ". therefore , the inner staple b2 helps the pairing of the outer staple b1 by suppressing part of the entropic penalty related to the bulge formed by the scaffold .",
    "when b1 is in the inner part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]a.d ) , its binding is significantly destabilized : the maximum peak is located at 41.5 @xmath4 , 15 k lower than the value of the dsdna and with a half width as large as 12 k. this is three times larger than the one of b1@xmath15 .",
    "again , when the b2 staple is added ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]a.e ) , the pairing of b1 is stabilized with a maximum peak much higher located at 50 @xmath4 but still with a rather large half width of 8 k. these experimental results support the evidence of a strong correlation between the two strands : the presence of b2 helps the folding of b1 whatever its location . moreover",
    ", these results also show that the location of the strand is of importance , the inner location being much less favourable .",
    "because b1 folds at a much lower temperature than b2 , the binding of b2 is not influenced by the presence of b1 .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]b illustrates the influence of the location ( inner or outer ) for b2 .",
    "the double helix structure b2@xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]b.a ) has a maximum peak at 91@xmath4 with a half width of 3.5 k , while when b2 is in the inner position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]b.b ) the peak is located at 83 @xmath4 with a half width of 8 k. when b2 is in the outer position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]b.c ) the peak is located at 86.5@xmath4 and is slightly narrower ( half width of 6.5 k ) .",
    "therefore , the same differences between the inner and outer positions are observed whatever the chemical sequence involved .",
    "the experimental results obtained with the b1m - b2 m set of staples are shown in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]c and [ fig : allsmall]d ) .",
    "the same trends as in the b1-b2 case are observed but with less pronounced effects : the temperature shifts and the increase of the half width with respect to the melting curves of the double strands b1m@xmath17 and b2m@xmath18 are smaller .",
    "a correlation effect is also noticeable , and is now observed for both strands b1 m and b2 m . when the staple b1 m is in the solution , the staple b2 m , which folds at a higher temperature , shows a narrower peak at a maximum 1.5 @xmath4 higher than when it is alone .",
    "therefore partial folding of the staple b1 m helps the folding of the staple b2 m .",
    "similarly to what was observed in the previous case , the correlation effect is even more effective when we consider the influence of the b2 m staple on the folding process of the b1 m staple ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allsmall]c.d ) with a shift of the melting temperature from 67 @xmath4 to 72 @xmath4 .",
    "the previous section considered the folding of simple dna constructions that go beyond the simplest double stranded dna structure . a visual inspection of rothemund dna origamis shows that small origamis can be considered as their building blocks .",
    "therefore , we expect that the same physical mechanisms ( cooperativity and topological effects ) that explain the formation of small origamis will be present in the formation of larger origamis . however , we first need to make a few hypothesis in order to make the problem tractable . the basic difficulty is related to the huge number of possible configurations that need to be handled to compute average properties such as the number of open base pairs .",
    "long linear structures of double stranded dna can be computed rigorously because recurrence relations can be established in such cases @xcite,@xcite .",
    "dna origamis are highly connected structures bearing pseudoknots .",
    "this prevents the use of linear recurrences .",
    "the dna origami folding process can be generally described by a set of insertion reactions of the form @xmath19 where @xmath5 denotes the @xmath20th staple , and @xmath21 represents a particular set of neighbour staples ( to be defined below ) that influence the insertion of staple @xmath5 .",
    ". [ eqins ] will be made more precise in the following . to proceed further , we need to make further approximations .",
    "each staple @xmath5 of length @xmath22 can be divided in parts that hybridize to non - contiguous regions of the scaffold .",
    "let us note @xmath23 such a division of the strand sequence ( typically , each 32b staple is divided in three parts but other partitions are possible ) .",
    "staples in the small origamis are divided in two parts : @xmath24 .    * hypothesis 1 * : we will focus on configurations where each part",
    "@xmath25 is either completely hybridized to the scaffold or completely unbound",
    ". moreover , we also disregard misfolded configurations , that is , staples that partially hybridize to the wrong part of the scaffold .",
    "notice that this assumption is plausible for the one layer origamis we consider here . for",
    "more complex , multi - layered structures , the staples are divided in smaller parts so that the probability to bind to the wrong part of the scaffold is considerably increased .",
    "we also disregard possible secondary structures of the scaffold .",
    "we will call _ crossover _ the connection between two contiguous parts of any staple .",
    "a crossover is not associated with a particular dna base , it is only a convenient notation to describe the connectivity of the origami . in rothemund",
    "s origamis @xcite , typical staples are 32 bases long and composed of three parts ( 8,16,8 bases long respectively ) linked by two crossovers @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "on the scaffold side , a crossover is associated with a loop , a subset of the scaffold that is hybridized ( or not ) depending on the presence of other staples . in the previous example ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simpleshema]a ) b1 and b2 are composed of two parts connected by a crossover , and b0 plays the role of the scaffold .",
    "* hypothesis 2 * : configurations with non contiguous hybridized parts are forbidden . this hypothesis is well verified when the central part of the staple is much longer than the other parts . in the following , we will note @xmath28 the configuration where @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are hybridized , the other parts being unpaired .",
    "the model aims to compute the probability @xmath31 of having a particular folded state of the staple @xmath5 at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we will assume that at very high temperature @xmath32 , all the staples are unfolded : @xmath33 ( in practice , @xmath34@xmath4 ) .",
    "the model is _ recursive _ : @xmath35 is computed based on the knowledge of @xmath31 . the increment @xmath36 can be positive or negative : the algorithm starts from @xmath37 , the temperature decreases down to a value @xmath38 , then increases again . at any temperature @xmath8",
    ", the probability to observe a given configuration @xmath39 will depend upon the presence ( or not ) of neighbour staples .",
    "therefore , for each staple a set of possible neighbour staples @xmath40 needs to be defined . in the following",
    ", we will use the generic notation @xmath41 for any of these neighborhoods .",
    "how many staples one has to consider in each of these sets is a parameter of the model . in this paper ,",
    "all the origamis are such that the crossovers can be aligned in rows . in the following , for each staple and crossover , the set of neighbour staples",
    "will be limited to those that have crossovers in the same row , and are separated by less than 75b .",
    "let us note that all the results on this paper are robust against variations of this parameter . with these notations ,",
    "the probability to observe the staple @xmath5 in a given configuration @xmath42 and for a given neighbourhood @xmath43 is modelized by an equilibrium reaction : @xmath44 this modelling therefore does not consider any kinetic effect .",
    "notice however that the equilibrium hypothesis is a _ local _ one .",
    "indeed , we expect that the model will reflect the hysteresis observed in the annealing - melting of dna origamis .    * hypothesis 3 * : because the model only keeps track of the single probabilities @xmath31 and not of the joint probabilities @xmath45 , it is necessary to make an additional approximation to determine @xmath46 .",
    "again , based on the data from the small origamis , we assume that there is a strong correlation between the different staples .",
    "as the processes of annealing and melting are monotonous , for two staples @xmath47 and @xmath48 we make the hypothesis that if @xmath49 , then the @xmath48 staple is present in the structure when @xmath47 starts to fold . in order to compute @xmath46 ,",
    "let us generalize this idea and order the staples in @xmath50 in such a way that @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the scaffold . according to the _ high correlation hypothesis _",
    ", we approximate the joint probabilities in the following way : @xmath53    for instance , in the case where only two crossovers influence @xmath5 , with probability @xmath54 both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are present , the probability of only having @xmath56 is @xmath57 and the probability of only having the scaffold is @xmath58 .    the probability @xmath59 for staple @xmath5 to be hybridized at temperature @xmath8 is the solution of the coupled set of equations : @xmath60 this set of equations can be further approximated by the iteration : @xmath61 here , @xmath36 denotes the temperature step that determines the annealing - melting protocol and @xmath62 the conditional probability to hybridize staple @xmath5 in the neighborhood @xmath41 . in the annealing process ( @xmath63 ) , at high temperature @xmath64 , @xmath65 excepted for the empty neighborhood ( the staple hybridizes to the scaffold in the absence of any other staple ) . for lower temperatures",
    ", @xmath46 can be computed from the knowledge of @xmath59 and the correlations between staples ( hypothesis 3 ) .",
    "we show in appendix a that the set of coupled equations [ eqcl ] determines @xmath31 provided the equilibrium constants of the reactions [ eqins1 ] are known .",
    "this amounts to define an energy model which is detailed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we introduce an energy model for the hybridization of staples to the scaffold of a dna origami . the gain in gibbs free energy for hybridizing @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath66 contains two contributions : @xmath67 the local contribution @xmath68 only depends on the sequence of @xmath39 .",
    "it quantifies the gain in free energy associated with the local formation of double helices .",
    "we use the parameters of the nearest - neighbour model @xcite with a temperature correction given in @xcite ( see appendix [ tscorr ] and @xcite for a detailed description ) .    @xmath69 gathers several contributions that depend on the connectivity of the origami ( @xmath68 depends mostly on the sequence of the scaffold and , to a less extent , on the density of crossovers , but not on the connectivity ) . with any crossover , we associate an entropic penalty .",
    "this penalty reflects the difficulty for a staple to hybridize non - contiguous parts of the scaffold . in a first approximation",
    ", the longer the region of the scaffold that connects the two parts to be hybridized , the larger the penalty .",
    "our previous results obtained with the small origami show that this needs to be refined . based on these data ,",
    "we consider three situations characterized by transient arrangements of staples that we call _ local intermediate states _",
    "( lis ) . in the first one ( lis1 ) , the staple hybridizes to the scaffold , forming an internal asymmetric loop @xcite , fig .  [",
    "fig : twodefect]a .",
    "the length of this loop corresponds to the number of unpaired bases of the scaffold linked by the crossover .",
    "this is a generalization of the outer position found for the three strands origami . before the crossover formation , when only part of the staple is folded , the scaffold and the non hybridized part of the staple are on the same side of the hybridized part of the staple ( fig .  [",
    "fig : simpleshema]b ) . in this case , the staple is not involved in the path that connects the two extremities of the crossover .",
    "a particular case of lis1 , which we call lis2 , is the situation where the length of the loop is zero : the crossover forms locally a holliday junction , the staple hybridizes in the close vicinity of an already hybridized staple ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twodefect]b ) .",
    "the third lis , lis3 , corresponds to the inner position in the small origami : the shortest path that connects the two ends of the crossover involves the staple itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twodefect]c ) .",
    "because of this , before the crossover forms , the non hybridized parts of the strand and the scaffold are located on opposite sides of the hybridized parts ( fig .  [",
    "fig : simpleshema]c ) .",
    "therefore , lis3 implies a larger penalty than lis1 or lis2 . in the small origami ,",
    "the shift in @xmath70 was less than 10 @xmath4 for lis1 , between 5 @xmath4 and 7 @xmath4 for lis2 and up to 15 @xmath4 for lis3 .",
    "to each of these lis is associated a different @xmath69 :    * @xmath71(lis1)@xmath72 .",
    "the function @xmath73 is that of ref .",
    "@xmath74 corresponds to the number of bases along the scaffold and @xmath75 is the average value of bases folded along the scaffold ( this average takes into account the probabilities of all the possible neighbouring configurations ) .",
    "the comparison between this model and the experimental results from the small origami structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : brinloopdefect ] . * @xmath71(lis2 ) @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this constant contribution has been derived so as to fit as well as possible the b1-b2 experimental data ( left of fig .",
    "[ fig : brinscouple ] ) and then applied to the b1m - b2 m data ( right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : brinscouple ] ) .",
    "+ at the crossover , two bases that belong to @xmath5 face the bases constituting the crossover made by the other strand .",
    "the initial enthalpic and entropic contribution of this pair of bases is subtracted from @xmath68 as they are not nearest - neighbours anymore .",
    "one half of the contribution ( nearest - neighbour model ) of the two new pair of bases is added .",
    "* @xmath71(lis3 ) @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twodefect]c ) : an additional penalty is added to the entropic penalty of the loop .",
    "this intends to reflect the stronger instability characteristic of this lis .",
    "@xmath80 ( resp @xmath81 ) quantifies the loss of enthalpy ( resp entropy ) associated with the partial unfolding of the ends of an staple involved in this type of lis .",
    "the number of bases that unfold is a parameter of the model .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : brinsinerc ] correspond to the unfolding of a total of 8 bases ( two bases for each of the four extremities of the staple , see fig .",
    "[ fig : twodefect]c ) .    under some circumstances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twodefect]d ) , two types of lis can be attributed to a given crossover . in such cases ,",
    "the lis with the smaller @xmath69 is taken into account .",
    "the modelling obtained with the contributions @xmath68 and @xmath69 is quite satisfactory except for a constant negative shift ( @xmath82k ) of the melting temperatures .",
    "this shift indicates that another stabilizing mechanism that is not present in small constructions such as the small origamis has to be invoked .",
    "indeed , in the folded structure of origamis , double - helix sections are separated by distances of the order of 1 nm .",
    "it is then reasonable to think that mechanisms such as correlations between counter - ions and hydration forces come also into play , as is the case when dna condensates @xcite .",
    "this electrostatic stabilizing term is proportional to the number of neighbouring bases @xmath83 that are close to the staple @xmath5 , and to the length @xmath84 of the partial configuration @xmath39 considered .",
    "@xmath85 the energy per base @xmath86 is similar to the one needed for dna condensation @xmath87 to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the presence of this term would be the entropy reduction due to the confinement of the double helices in a 2d structure .    the probability to fold any part @xmath89 of staple @xmath5 is given by the sum of the probabilites of any configuration @xmath39 that contains @xmath89 : @xmath90 the fraction of folded bases for staple @xmath5 @xmath91 can be then converted to a theoretical absorbance @xcite as in the case of small origamis [ absorption ] .",
    "we considered four different dna origamis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drawing ] ) with the same scaffold ( m13mp18 virus ) and about 200 staples .",
    "o1 is the rectangle in the original rothemund work @xcite , the staples are mostly 32b long , with folding part sequences divided in 8 - 16 - 8 patterns .",
    "o2 is another rectangular origami that includes a hole @xcite and presents the same 8 - 16 - 8 pattern .",
    "o3 has the same connectivity pattern as o1 , but some staples have been merged two by two in four areas ( coloured in black in [ fig : drawing]c ) , so that the typical staple pattern is 8 - 16 - 16 - 16 - 8 .",
    "finally , o4 is another rectangular origami where a 100b long subset of the scaffold goes from one side to the other of the rectangle , forming a ssdna bridge.    for each origami , a series of annealing - melting cycles was performed coupled to uv - absorption measurements . with the methods of @xcite , the degree of pairing @xmath14",
    "was extracted as a function of temperature . the temperature ramp ( 0.4 @xmath4 min@xmath92 )",
    "is typical for this one - layer origamis .",
    "the annealing - melting process is not symmetrical , the hysteresis between the two phases of a cycle is such that the melting takes place at temperatures higher than the annealing .",
    "there is an overall agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drawing ] ) between the melting - annealing curves observed experimentally and computed with the model .",
    "the model captures the hysteresis between the annealing and melting processes , as well as the relative strength of this hysteresis between different origamis ( o2 has only 4k shift between annealing - melting , whereas o4 has 10k shift ) .",
    "the maximum value of the derivative , which can be linked to the overall enthalpy of the transition in a two - state model , is also reproduced .",
    "this feature is robust against small variations of the parameters of the model .      in this section",
    ", we will rely on the model developed in the previous section to explore how the melting temperature of the rectangular origamis depends on the specific connectivity .",
    "this type of considerations could be relevant in applications where it is necessary to improve the stability of the template against temperature ( dna origamis as platforms controlling chemical reactions or other applications including grafting inorganic species ) .",
    "[ sec-2_1 ]      the scaffold used for the design of rectangular origamis is a circular phage .",
    "thus , it is possible to choose the beginning of the scaffold sequence anywhere so that 7248 different sets of staples ( with same length and position , but with a different composition ) are possible .",
    "we compared the melting curves given by those permutations on the o4 origami , permuting the sequence in steps of 16 bases as this shifts the middle of one staple to the middle of the nearby staple .",
    "the distribution of temperatures corresponding to the maximum of the derivative for the annealing and melting curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : permutation]a ) shows an amplitude of variation of about 4 @xmath4 . depending on the permutation",
    ", the melting curves can be very different in shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : permutation]b ) .",
    "we conclude that , for a given scaffold , there is some sort of invariance regarding the choice of the origin .      in our model",
    ", a penalty is associated to each crossover . reducing the number of crossovers should in principle increase the stability in the annealing process .",
    "we started from the o1 shape to reduce the number of crossovers , as its design is more regular . in the initial origami",
    "there is a length of 32 bases between two crossovers , which corresponds to three periods in the double helix .",
    "increasing the distance between crossovers leads to consider 54 bases ( 5 double - helix periods ) .",
    "we considered two possibilities , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dependence ] : staples 27b long , split in 13 - 14 ( o6 origami ) , and staples 54b long , split in 13 - 27 - 14 ( o5 origami ) . indeed , there is a trade - off between the gain in enthalpy when increasing the length of the staple , and the additional penalty of having two crossovers/ staple instead of only one .",
    "our model shows that the net gain in stability , compared to the initial 8 - 16 - 8 staple strategy , is almost 20 @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dependence ] o5 ) .",
    "again , the comparison with the experiments is excellent .",
    "notice that decreasing the number of crossovers could have an impact on the flexibility of the origami .",
    "dna origamis appear as a versatile tool to design various types of dna based nanostructures .",
    "we have introduced a simple algorithm based on known thermodynamic properties of dsdna and their parameterization with the nn - model @xcite .",
    "the energy model is based on a preliminary study on small origamis that points to the importance of crossovers and their associated entropic penalty and correlation effects .",
    "this algorithm provides a reasonable account of the observed melting and annealing behaviour of dna origamis .",
    "the model reproduces hysteresis and melting temperatures , as well as the width of the melting curve .",
    "the hypothesis of local equilibrium turns out to be compatible with the experimentally observed hysteresis .",
    "the model emphasizes the role of cooperativity in the folding process by introducing correlations between the probability of presence of neighbour staples .",
    "this shows that the folding of each staple is strongly dependent on the existence of a nearby cluster of folded staples .",
    "an intuitive picture can be derived from this modelling . in the annealing process ,",
    "only the staples with a high gc content are able to fold at high temperature .",
    "these staples provide with initial nuclei that facilitate the folding of the neighbour staples .",
    "therefore , the folding of staples with high at content will take place at a temperature which is dependent on the distance to the set of these initial nuclei . during the melting process",
    ", the unfolding of any staple is mostly independent on its neighborhood and it is well accounted by an average penalty in free energy .",
    "the histeresis is then explained by the fact that the neighborhood of each staple is different in the annealing or melting .    as a possible application",
    ", we have shown that the model allows to improve the thermal stability by quantifying the effect of different construction factors such as staple length and density of crossovers .",
    "extensions to 3d @xcite @xcite and structures other than origami @xcite are envisioned , as well as tests at the single molecule level ( fret ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the interaction with the depositing surface will be crucial to interpret future afm measurements on the folding of dna origamis .",
    "this work was partially supported by cnrs ( pir funding ) .",
    "thanks to carmelo di primo for letting us use its equipment .",
    "thanks to jean - louis mergny for letting us use its equipment and to thao tran for the origami o2 .",
    "[ sec : detail ]    in this section , we explain how to compute the probability @xmath31 by solving a set of coupled equations which reflect the assumption that the reaction @xmath93 is governed by the law of mass action . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we consider first the particular case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : statem ] : a staple divided in two parts of equal length is inserted in the vicinity of another staple that holds together a portion of the scaffold .",
    "for this particular example , we nees to consider three equilibriums : the simultaneous binding of the two parts of @xmath5 , with equilibrium constant : @xmath94 the binding of only one half @xmath95 of the staple , with equilibrium constant : @xmath96    the binding of the other half @xmath97 of the staple : @xmath98    more generally , for any set of equilibriums between @xmath5 and its neighborhood @xmath41 , the law of mass action reads :    @xmath99}{[n_{\\alpha}(s_i)][s_i ] } = k^{n_{\\alpha}(s_i ) } _ { s_i(l , p ) } = exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta g(s_i(l , p),t)}{kt } \\right)\\ ] ]    the concentration of free staples in solution is given by @xmath100 @xmath101 is the excess of staple concentration , compared to the initial concentration of scaffold @xmath102 , @xmath103 the conditional probability to observe @xmath104 given the neighbour staples @xmath105 and @xmath106 the probability of the neighborhood @xmath107 . in order to get a closed set of equations , we approximate @xmath108 where @xmath36 is the temperature step in the melting - annealing process .    as the excess in dna origami annealing experiments is important",
    ", the concentration of free staples will vary weakly in the process of formation .",
    "it is then approximated by @xmath109 .",
    "the concentration of free @xmath110 ( @xmath5 not bounded ) is given by : @xmath111    the concentration of the configuration @xmath112 hybridized in the neighborhood @xmath41 is @xmath113    the approximated expression of the equilibrium constant is therefore : @xmath114    this set of equations can be solved by noticing that the denominator in [ eqke ] is independent of @xmath112 .",
    "thus , for any couple of configurations @xmath115 , @xmath116 let @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "then , by summing over @xmath119 and @xmath120 eq .",
    "[ eqke ] reduces to :    @xmath121    or :    @xmath122    and finally @xmath123",
    "the computation of the nearest - neighbour contribution @xmath124 includes corrections to take into account temperature and salt variations .",
    "besides the nearest - neighbour contributions ( @xmath125 ) @xcite , we have also included temperature dependent corrections : @xmath126 \\delta s_{nn}(s_i(l , p ) ) & = & \\delta s_{n}^0(s_i(l , p ) ) + c_p|l - p+1| \\ln ( \\frac{t}{t_{ref}})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        the parameters of the nn model @xcite are given for standard salt concentrations ( [ na]=1 m , [ mg]=0 ) .",
    "different salt conditions can be taken into account using the correcting terms in @xcite .",
    "these corrections apply when mg is dominant .",
    "we assume that for each attachment of the staple @xmath5 on the configuration @xmath112 ( of length @xmath129 ) , the relation @xmath130 between the melting temperatures @xmath70 at different concentrations of mg and na holds ( @xmath131 is the fraction of gc content of @xmath39 ) .        it can be deduced that the salt corrections are taken into account by an entropic correction given by : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the sum of all the contributions previously cited ( nearest - neighbour , temperature corrections , topological contributions ) . in this paper",
    ", we modified the function @xmath136 as given in @xcite by a small additive term to take into account low at content strands . in order to do this , we compared the predictions of @xcite with the experimental results obtained with the small origamis . in @xcite , the authors calibrated their model against 17 different dsdna , involving a wide range of salt concentrations , and obtained a mean deviation @xmath137 @xmath4 .",
    "we deal here with a more restricted range of salt concentrations , it is therefore expected that the model @xcite can be improved .",
    "we used a correction to the @xmath138 function of @xcite for the low fractions @xmath131 of gc content , to obtain a mean deviation of @xmath139 @xmath4 .",
    "the corrected @xmath138 function reads :                                                                               and the modeling ( continuous line ) as provided by the contribution @xmath69(lis2 ) .",
    "the curves clustered around @xmath141 @xmath4 correspond to b1 in position outer ( cyan),b1 in position inner ( magenta ) , the modelling does not make any difference between these two cases .",
