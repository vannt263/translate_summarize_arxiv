    "as mentioned above , direct determination of @xmath55 ( or @xmath25 ) from the slope of @xmath93-@xmath94 curves only makes sense when @xmath55 is a constant , thus the linear fit of @xmath93-@xmath94 curves should be carried out above 107.1 k , as shown by the dash lines .",

    "the data obey kosterlitz relation ( @xmath147 ) above 107.1 k , but deviate from the linear relation below 107.1 k. this may be interpreted as the crossover to finite - size effect . the directly measured @xmath53-@xmath46 data with a finite current drop more sharply than @xmath21 do .",

    "[ fig : ffh ] which is not so perfect can be attributed to that the data showing finite - size effect were scaled together with the data in the thermal dynamic limit by dynamic scaling method .",
    "so for the data at temperatures above @xmath20 , if we remove those data showing finite - size effect and only consider the data at higher temperatures where @xmath149 , the scaling collapse should be better .",

    "the temperatures of the shown data are from 107.1 to 116 k , and the scaling parameters are : ( a ) @xmath75 k , @xmath153 , @xmath4 ; ( b ) @xmath154 k , @xmath155 , @xmath72.,width=302 ]    a pure ktb transition , in the thermodynamic limit , requires @xcite @xmath156 and @xmath157 . for the tbcco sample with intrinsically high anisotropy , the estimated value of @xmath158 is about 60 @xmath57 m with @xmath159   and @xmath160  , and the lateral sample size @xmath161 @xmath57 m , thus the sample size @xmath35 is not much larger compared with the size of vortex pairs and @xmath5 is not much greater than @xmath35 , especially at zero temperature .",

    "the results from all these methods are consistent with each other that the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics are dominated by the vortex - unbinding with the nominal transition temperature @xmath75 k , and the dynamic scaling exponent @xmath4 hence the @xmath0-@xmath1 exponent @xmath30 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "besides , the evidence of finite - size effect is also found , that the maxima of slope @xmath18 of logarithmic @xmath0-@xmath1 isotherms cross over from @xmath35-dependent to @xmath27-dependent with the crossover temperature at 105 k , slightly above @xmath20 .",
    "the finite - size - caused free vortices will lead to the absence of a phase transition in a strict sense , and will turn the phase transition into a crossover behavior @xcite .",

    "this can be interpreted by the high experimental temperature near @xmath9 so that the size of our sample is not in the finite - size limit as that in the simulation work of medvedyeva _ et al .",
