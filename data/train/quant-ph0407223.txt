    "an important theoretic construct used in the field of quantum information is the qubit .",
    "its utility follows from the simple but significant recognition that all two dimensional subspaces , regardless of the underlying physical system , can be regarded as informationally equivalent .",
    "this has made it possible to discuss quantum computation in terms of single qubit and two qubit gates without the need to analyze the specific interactions that realize operations within a physical system or between subsystems .",
    "an important issue in this regard is that a necessary condition for _ efficient _ quantum computation is the existence of an underlying tensor product structure on the hilbert space @xmath15 .",
    "if all computation were performed on a single @xmath16 level system then some physical resource such as space or energy would grow with the dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the analogous resources grow poly - logarithmically with the dimension when the system is composed of many subsystems . by this argument , a computation performed on qubits @xmath17 is in some sense the most efficient foliation of hilbert space .    nevertheless , there are compelling reasons to consider computation on qudits with @xmath18 .",
    "first , most physical implementations encode qubits in a subspace of a larger hilbert space .",
    "using higher dimensional subspaces already endowed in these systems may be more efficient in terms of the number of interacting gates needed for an algorithm that acts on a hilbert space of fixed dimension .",
    "this is critical for error control because interactions between qudits tend to open channels for interactions with the decohering environment .",
    "by contrast , in many physical systems , single qudit control is a well developed technology that can be done with high precision .",
    "second , there is some evidence that the error thresholds for fault tolerant computation improve when the encoding is done with qudits where @xmath18 and prime @xcite .",
    "previous work by brylinski and brylinski proves the necessary and sufficient criteria for exact qudit universality @xcite .",
    "exact universality means that any unitary and , by unitary extension to a larger hilbert space , any _ quantum process _",
    ", can be simulated with zero error .",
    "the authors show that arbitrary single qudit gates complemented by one entangling two qudit gate is needed .",
    "their method is not constructive .",
    "muthukrishnan and stroud @xcite give a constructive procedure for an exact simulation of an arbitrary unitary on @xmath19 qudits using single qudit and two qudit gates .",
    "their approach uses the spectral decomposition of unitaries and involves a gate library consisting of a family of continuous parameter gates . here",
    "we describe an approach that uses the @xmath6 decompositions on unitaries to achieve exact universal computation on qudits .",
    "this construction has the advantage that the single qudit gates are generated by a fixed set of hamiltonians that couple pairs of states in the single qudit logical basis .",
    "the gates perform rotations , parameterized by one angle , about orthogonal axes within the associated two dimensional subspace .",
    "additionally , our decomposition requires only one fixed two qudit gate , the controlled increment gate @xmath20 gate .",
    "this gate can be simulated by at most @xmath10 instances of a two - qudit hamiltonian @xmath21 that generates a phase on a single product state of two qudits .",
    "such interactions can be engineered in many atom optical systems .    in this paper ,",
    "the general results are developed with close contact to the example of computation in the @xmath22 qudit encoded in the ground hyperfine states of @xmath14rb . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1qudit ] we describe the construction of single qudit unitaries using the @xmath6 decomposition . we introduce a coupling graph to describe how states are connected to each other by physical hamiltonians .",
    "the set of rotation planes may be incomplete , i.e. each state may not be connected to every other state . however , provided the graph is connected , an efficient decomposition can be found .",
    "multiqudit computation is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : multiqudit ] .",
    "it is shown that a single two - qudit gate when combined with single qudit gates suffices to generate arbitrary two qudit unitaries and hence completes the requirements for exact universality . in the appendix",
    "we show how to convert between the gate library introduced here and the family of gates used in ref .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary of the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we pick a fixed gate library for single qudit operations involving rotations about non orthogonal axes of two dimensional subspaces . within each subspace @xmath23 ,",
    "the gates are generated by the two hamiltonians : @xmath24 for convenience of notation , we assume the strength of each coupling is equal to @xmath25 and leave the time each hamiltonian is applied as a free parameter . any unitary in the two dimensional subspace can be written @xmath26 \\\\ & = & & e^{-ih^x_{jk}t/\\hbar } \\ ; e^{-ih^y_{jk}t^{\\prime}/\\hbar}\\ ; e^{-ih^x_{jk}t^{\\prime\\prime}/\\hbar } \\label{evolve } \\end{array}\\ ] ] for the appropriate @xmath27 using the xyx euler angle decomposition @xcite . in some cases , the two hamiltonians in eq .",
    "[ singlecouple ] can be turned on simultaneously . by adjusting the relative strengths of the couplings",
    ", one can then realize any rotation about an axis on the equator of the bloch sphere in the two dimensional subspace . for brevity ,",
    "we write @xmath28 , where it is understood that if the couplings @xmath29 can not be turned on together then @xmath30 requires three elementary gates .",
    "realization of an arbitrary unitary evolution @xmath31 requires two steps .",
    "the first corresponds to a @xmath6 decomposition @xcite of the matrix @xmath32 .    * using the allowed set of hamiltonians , we may realize matrices of _ givens rotations _ physically .",
    "these are described in the next paragraph .",
    "generically , the @xmath6 decomposition writes an invertible @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a product of givens rotations and hence unitary and @xmath35 is upper triangular .",
    "note that if @xmath36 is unitary , then so likewise is @xmath37 , whence @xmath35 is in this case a diagonal matrix which applies relative phases to computational basis states . * using techniques for realizing diagonal computations @xcite , a sequence of hamiltonians realizing @xmath35 is constructed .",
    "we next illustrate the idea of a givens rotation by way of example , retaining @xmath38 as above .",
    "we may choose @xmath39 a givens rotation so as to zero the matrix element @xmath40 ( where the indices run @xmath41 . ) specifically , suppose that @xmath42 here , we choose the angles @xmath43 , @xmath44 as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the entrees of the unitary @xmath38 . then letting @xmath47 denote a changed entry , we obtain : @xmath48 in the next step , one chooses a unitary @xmath49 to zero the matrix element @xmath50 .",
    "continuing carefully in this way allows one to complete the @xmath6 decomposition described above by introducing a zero into every entry of the resulting unitary below the diagonal .",
    "we begin by describing explicitly the implications of our constructions for an example which is related to but not covered explicitly by earlier work of mathukrishnan and stroud @xcite .",
    "specifically , we describe the coupling graph alluded to in the introduction in this case before defining it in general .",
    "thus , consider the atomic species @xmath14rb per fig .",
    "[ fig : hyperfine ] .",

    "we designate this @xmath22 system a quoctet .",
    "the degeneracy can be lifted by applying a longitudinal magnetic field @xmath56 . for small fields ,",
    "the resultant zeeman interaction is linear in the magnetic quantum number : @xmath57 , where the lande @xmath58 factors satisfy @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to couple the magnetic sublevels including the use of microwave pulses and raman lasers .",
    "these techniques are usually distinguished by the strength of the coupling with respect to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "we consider coupling that is weak relative to @xmath53 using a pair of laser beams on raman resonance between two sublevels at a time .",
    "the effective atom - laser hamiltonian @xmath60 in the subspace @xmath23 is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the product of the individual laser rabi frequencies divided by the detuning @xmath63 from the excited state , and @xmath64 is the relative phase of the two beams . in order to selectively couple two states",
    "it is necessary that their energy difference be unique . in the linear zeeman regime , this can only be accommodated when the two levels reside in different hyperfine manifolds .",
    "additionally , it will be important to minimize spontaneous emission during the pulse sequence by choosing a large detuning @xmath63 of each laser from the excited states . the allowed couplings are constrained by angular momentum selection rules which dictate the change in magnetic spin quantum number during a single pulse sequence . for detuning @xmath63 much greater than the excited state hyperfine structure , but less than than the fine structure splitting ,",
    "the angular momentum selection rules dictate @xmath65 and @xmath66 . using two - laser pulses of the appropriate frequency and polarization ,",
    "the states @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath65 can then be coupled together .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",

    "a pair of lasers can couple states in different hyperfine manifolds according to the selection rule @xmath72 .",
    "projective measurements of population in state @xmath73 are made by observing resonant fluorescence on a cycling transition to the excited state .",

    "transitions realizing @xmath65 can be achieved by choosing the correct polarizations for the lasers with respect to a quantization axis defined by the magnetic field direction . for a fixed zeeman splitting",
    ", it will be necessary to have lasers tuned to raman resonance for all the allowed couplings .",
    "this may be achievable using a fixed source laser source that is frequency modulated appropriately .",
    "another recourse is to change the magnetic field strength for each pairwise state coupling so that only one laser pair of fixed frequency is necessary .",
    "the phase shifts accumulated on the basis states during the change in zeeman interaction can be accounted for in the gate sequence .",
    "we wish to show that the above set of atom - laser hamiltonians suffices to construct an arbitrary unitary evolution of the one - quoctet phase space .",

    "this is sometimes not possible , depending on which states @xmath79 , @xmath80 are coupled by an @xmath60 . in order to classify when the @xmath6 step is possible , we introduce the notion of a _ coupling graph _ , by example .",
