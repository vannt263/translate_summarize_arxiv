    "the _ fermi _  gamma - ray space telescope hosts two instruments , the large area telescope @xcite and the gamma - ray burst monitor @xcite , which together are capable of measuring the spectral parameters of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) across seven decades in energy . since the start of gbm and lat science operations in early august 2008 , emission at energies",
    "@xmath4100mev has been detected from ten grbs .",
    "these detections were made possible by the lat s greater sensitivity and shorter deadtime ( 26@xmath5s ) compared to previous instruments . prior to _ fermi _ , high - energy gamma - rays from grbs with energies up to 18 gev were observed by the egret instrument on - board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory_. the egret observations suggested three types of high - energy emission : an extrapolation of the low energy spectra to the @xmath4100 mev band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an additional spectral component during the prompt emission @xcite and in the case of grb 940217 , a gev afterglow which was detectable for 90 minutes after the trigger @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of these events were not determined .",
    "recently , reported that grb  080514b which triggered agile at lower energies , was detected by the grid instrument up to 300 mev .",
    "a photometric redshift of @xmath6 was reported for this event .    in the _ fermi _  era , due to the advanced localization capabilities of the lat and the rapid follow - up by the _ swift _ narrow field instruments @xcite and the ground - based follow - up community ,",
    "redshifts for five of the ten lat bursts have been measured .",
    "these include grb  080916c with @xmath7 , a long burst that has the highest inferred isotropic energy , @xmath8ergs ( 10 kev10 gev ) @xcite , and grb  090510 with @xmath9 @xcite , the second short burst seen by the lat and the first short burst to show definitively an additional hard power - law component in the gev band during the prompt phase @xcite .",
    "grb  090902b is a long , fairly intense burst with a redshift of @xmath10 @xcite and fluence of @xmath11erg@xmath12 ( 10 kev10 gev ) over the first 25 seconds of the prompt emission .",
    "these data give an isotropic energy @xmath13ergs , comparable to that of grb  080916c .",
    "similar to grb  090510 , grb  090902b has a significant additional , hard power - law component that appears during the prompt phase .",
    "furthermore , a spectral feature at energies @xmath14kev is evident in the gbm spectrum of grb  090902b that is consistent with an extrapolation of the @xmath4100mev power - law emission down to those energies . in previous analyses ,",
    "@xcite reported evidence for an additional low - energy spectral component below 20kev for @xmath15% of batse bursts .",
    "we report on the observations and analysis of gamma - ray emission from grb  090902b measured by the gbm and lat instruments . in section 2",
    ", we present details of the detections by both instruments and summarize the follow - up observations . in section 3",
    ", we show the light curves of the prompt emission as seen by the various detectors and describe the extended emission found in the lat data out to 1 ks after the trigger . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the time - resolved spectral analysis of the burst emission during the prompt phase .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we discuss the physical interpretation of the gbm and lat data , focusing on the implications of the power - law component for models of grb physics .",
    "on 2009 september 2 at 11:05:08.31 ut , the _ fermi _  gamma - ray burst monitor triggered on and localized the bright burst grb 090202b ( trigger 273582310 / 090902462 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the burst was within the lat field of view initially at an angle of 51@xmath16 from the boresight .",
    "this event was sufficiently bright in the gbm that an autonomous repoint request was made , and the spacecraft began slewing within 10 seconds towards the burst .",
    "after @xmath1200 seconds , it had pointed the lat boresight to within a few degrees of the final burst localization .",
    "it maintained that pointing until @xmath11 ks post - trigger , when the earth s limb began to enter the lat field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "this burst was detected up to @xmath15 mev by gbm , and emission was significantly detected by the lat , with 39 photons above 1 gev .",
    "the highest energy photon had @xmath17 gev and arrived 82 seconds after the gbm trigger ; and the initial analyses detected photons as late as 300 seconds after the trigger @xcite .    from the lat data , the burst was localized to r.a.(j2000 ) , dec(j2000 ) = 265.00 , 27.33 with a statistical uncertainty of 0.04@xmath16 ( + @xmath180.1@xmath16 systematic ) , enabling target of opportunity observations to begin @xmath112.5 hours after the trigger with the narrow field instruments on _ swift_. a candidate x - ray afterglow within the lat error circle was detected by the x - ray telescope ( xrt , * ? ? ?",
    "this source was confirmed to be fading @xcite , and uvot observations revealed the optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "the earliest ground - based optical observations were obtained by rotse - iiia @xmath11.4 hours post trigger @xcite .",
    "other detections were reported in the optical @xcite , in the near infrared by grond @xcite and in the radio @xcite .",
    "the location of the fading source detected by grond was r.a.(j2000 ) , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath19 , + 271927.1 , 3.3 arcminutes from the lat location @xcite .",
    "the afterglow redshift of @xmath10 was measured by @xcite using the gmos spectrograph mounted on the gemini - north telescope .",
    "in figure  [ fig : prompt light curves ] , we show the gbm and lat light curves in several energy bands .",
    "the top three panels show data from the most brightly illuminated nai and bgo detectors of the gbm , and the bottom three panels show the lat data with various event selections . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the measured photon energies are plotted as a function of time , including the highest energy event ( @xmath20gev ) that arrived 82 seconds after the gbm trigger time , @xmath21 . from the gbm light curves",
    ", we see that at energies @xmath221mev the prompt phase ends approximately 25 seconds after @xmath21 .",
    "detailed analysis of the gbm data for energies 50300 kev yields a formal t90 duration of 21.9 seconds starting at @xmath23s .",
    "by contrast , the lat emission @xmath4100mev clearly continues well after this time range .    on time scales",
    "longer than the prompt phase , the lat detects emission from grb 090902b as late as 1 ks after the gbm trigger .",
    "the spectrum of this emission is consistent with a power - law with photon index @xmath24 , and its flux ( @xmath4100mev ) declines as @xmath25 over the interval ( @xmath26s ) .",
    "as we note above , the lat observations are interrupted by entry of the earth s limb into the fov , but analysis of data after @xmath27s , when the source location is again unocculted , shows that any later emission lies below the lat sensitivity ( figure  [ fig : gev afterglow ] ) .",
    "the upper limit we obtain for data after @xmath27 is consistent with an extrapolation of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "similar late time emission for energies @xmath4100mev that extends well beyond the prompt phase has been seen for five earlier bursts by _ fermi _ : grb  080916c @xcite ; grb  090323 @xcite ; grb  090328 @xcite ; grb  090510 , independently seen by agile @xcite and by _ fermi _  @xcite ; and grb  090626 @xcite .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using the data from both the gbm and the lat .",
    "these analyses include data from the nai detectors 0,1,2,9,10 and bgo detectors , and lat `` transient '' class data , with front- and back - converting events considered separately .",
    "the nai data are fit from 8 kev to 1 mev and the bgo from 250 kev to 40 mev using the time tagged event ( tte ) data , which are high time resolution data that allow us to define the time intervals based on the structure of the gbm and lat light curves .",
    "the lat data are fit from 100 mev to 200 gev .",
    "an effective area correction of 0.9 has been fit to the bgo data to match the model normalizations given by the nai data ; this correction is consistent with the uncertainties in the gbm detector responses .",
    "the fits were performed with the spectral analysis software package rmfit ( version 3.1 ) . for further details on the data extraction and spectral analysis procedures see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the time - integrated spectrum of grb  090902b is best modeled by a band function @xcite and a power - law component ( table  [ tab : spectral params ] ) .",
    "the power - law component significantly improves the fit between 8kev and 200gev both in the time - integrated spectrum and in the individual time intervals where there are sufficient statistics .",
    "it is also required when considering only the gbm data ( 8kev40mev ) for the time - integrated spectrum , as its inclusion causes an improvement of @xmath282000 in the cstat statistic over the band function alone .",
    "when data below @xmath150 kev are excluded , a power - law component can be neglected in the gbm - only fits .",
    "we conclude that this power - law component contributes a significant part of the emission both at low ( @xmath1850kev ) and high ( @xmath4100mev ) energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : prompt spectrum ] shows the counts and unfolded @xmath29 spectra for a band function with a power - law component fit to the data for interval * b * ( when the low energy excess is most significant ) using the parameters given in table  [ tab : spectral params ] .",
    "spectral evolution is apparent in the band function component from the changing @xmath30 values throughout the burst , while @xmath31 remains soft until interval * e * when it hardens significantly .",
    "@xmath31 is similarly hard in interval * f * , after which the band function component is no longer detected .",
    "the hardening of @xmath31 is accompanied by an apparent hardening of the power - law index , @xmath32 , which until interval * e * does not exhibit much variation . however , this is not definitive since the flux is too low to constrain @xmath32 in intervals * e * and * f * separately",
    ". a spectral fit of the sum of these two intervals confirms the presence of both a harder @xmath31 and a harder @xmath32 , with a clear statistical preference for the inclusion of the power - law component .",
    "an equally good fit is obtained in the combined * e *  +  * f * interval if this power - law has an exponential cut - off at high energies , with the preferred cut - off energy lying above 2gev .",
    "finally , we note that in interval * b * , a marginally better fit is achieved using a model with the additional power - law component having an exponential cut - off at high energies .",
    "the improvement is at the @xmath33 level and indicates weak evidence for a cutoff in the second component , placing a lower limit on the cutoff energy in this interval of about 1gev .",
    "the _ fermi _  data for grb  090902b show for the first time clear evidence of excess emission both at low energies ( @xmath34kev ) and at high energies ( @xmath4100mev ) , while the band function alone fits data at intermediate energies adequately .",
    "these excesses are well - fit by a single power - law component suggesting a common origin .",
    "this power - law component accounts for @xmath35 of the total fluence in the 10  kev10  gev range , and its photon index is hard , with a value @xmath36 throughout most of the prompt phase .",
    "such a hard component producing the observed excess at low energies is difficult to explain in the context of leptonic models by the usual synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanisms . in the simplest versions of these models ,",
    "the peak of the ssc emission is expected to have a much higher energy than the synchrotron peak at mev energies , and the ssc component has a soft tail that is well below the synchrotron flux at lower energies and so would not produce excess emission below @xmath37  kev .",
    "hadronic models , either in the form of proton synchrotron radiation @xcite or photohadronic interactions @xcite , can produce a hard component with a similar low energy excess via direct and cascade radiation ( e.g. , synchrotron emission by secondary pairs at low energies ) .",
    "however , the total energy release in hadronic models would exceed the observed gamma - ray energy of @xmath38ergs significantly and may pose a challenge for the total energy budget .",
    "collimation into a narrow jet may alleviate the energy requirements , since the actual energy release from grb  090902b can be smaller by a jet beaming factor @xmath39 from the apparent isotropic value , where @xmath40 is the bulk lorentz factor of the fireball .    from the observation of a @xmath41  gev photon in interval * c * , the highest energy during the prompt phase and thus the most constraining , we derive a minimum value of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath42 using the flux variability time scale of @xmath43ms found in the bgo data .",
    "this limit follows from the constraint that the opacity for @xmath44 pair production with target photons fitted by the band+pl model in interval * c * is less than unity for the 11.16gev photon  .",
    "this high @xmath45 value is of the same order as the values derived for grb  080916c  @xcite and grb  090510  @xcite , both of which have been detected at @xmath46gev with the lat .",
    "the delayed onset of the @xmath47100 mev emission from the gbm trigger has been modeled for grb  080916c as arising from proton synchrotron radiation in the prompt phase  @xcite and for grb  090510 as arising from electron synchrotron radiation in the early afterglow phase @xcite . in order to produce the peak of the lat emission at @xmath48s in the early afterglow scenario for grb  090902b from deceleration of the grb fireball , a value of @xmath49 is required .",
    "this is similar to @xmath45 that we calculate , but the observed large amplitude variability on short time scales ( @xmath50  ms ) in the lat data , which is usually attributed to prompt emission , argues against such models . also , the appearance of the power - law component extending down to @xmath51  kev within only a few seconds of the grb trigger disfavors an afterglow interpretation . the proton synchrotron model , on the other hand , requires a rather large total energy budget , as mentioned previously .    yet another interpretation of the observed excess in the high and low energies may be provided by two non - thermal power - law components along with a thermal component from the jet photosphere  @xcite .",
    "the thermal component , broadened by temperature variations , then accounts for the @xmath52kev  few mev emission with @xmath53  @xcite , although fits of such a model to our data do not improve over the band+pl model .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult for the photospheric model to explain the delayed onset of the @xmath54100mev emission .",
    "the detection of the @xmath55gev photon , @xmath56seconds after the grb trigger and well after the soft gamma - ray emission subsided , may help constrain the origin of the late - time decay of the power - law component , which goes as @xmath2",
    ". a synchrotron origin of the 33.4 gev photon would be difficult since it would require significant energy gain by electrons over a gyroradius and a bulk lorentz factor @xmath41500 . in the case of diffusive shock - acceleration",
    ", the energy losses in the upstream region of the shock may dominate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and prevent acceleration of electrons to an energy high enough to radiate a 33.4 gev photon .",
    "an interpretation by afterglow ssc emission is still possible , however .    the constraints on the quantum gravity mass scale from grb  090902b using the time - of - flight test @xcite are much weaker than those from grb  090510 @xcite due to the larger interval , 82 seconds , between @xmath21 and the arrival time of the 33.4gev photon .",
    "however , the moderately high redshift ( @xmath0 ) of grb  090902b allows us to use this photon to probe and constrain models of the extragalactic background light .",
    "the 33.4 gev photon would not be absorbed by the ebl in any models except for the `` fast evolution '' and the `` baseline '' models by @xcite , which give optical depths of @xmath57 and 5.8 , respectively .",
    "we have performed spectral fits of the lat data with and without the predicted ebl absorption from stecker s models assuming a simple power - law as the intrinsic emission model . based on monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we found that stecker s fast evolution and baseline models are disfavored at a @xmath58 level .    in summary ,",
    "grb  090902b is one of the brightest bursts detected by the gbm and lat instruments on _ fermi_. it clearly shows excess emission at high and low energies during the prompt phase , requiring a hard power - law component in addition to the usual band function in order to fit the data .",
    "the origin of this component is not understood , and its presence in this burst poses genuine challenges for the theoretical models . like the other two bright _ fermi _",
    "bursts detected by the lat , grb 080916c and grb 090510 , grb 090902b appears to possess a very high lorentz factor for the bulk outflow , @xmath59 , and has some suggestion of a delayed onset of the emission above @xmath1100 mev .",
    "finally , the 33.4gev photon , the highest energy yet detected from a grb , and the @xmath0 redshift of this burst have allowed us to place significant constraints on some models of the extragalactic background light .",
