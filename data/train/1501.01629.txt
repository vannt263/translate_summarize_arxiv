    "the density at which a particular molecular transition is excited has always been an interesting quantity for studies of molecular gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "two concepts have been developed , the critical density and the effective excitation density , to quantify the excitation density of a transition . a traditional approach in studying",
    "the critical density has been to consider the molecular rotational energy levels as a simple two level system .",
    "while this approach has pedagogical advantages , the interpretation of concepts , such as critical density , are oversimplified and incorrect .",
    "molecules are fundamentally multi - level systems with radiative and collisional processes between the levels ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it is almost never appropriate to approximate commonly observed dense gas tracers , such as hco@xmath3 , hcn , nh@xmath7 , n@xmath4h@xmath3 , etc .",
    ", as two level systems .",
    "therefore , in this tutorial , we eschew the two level approximation and consider the full multi - level nature of molecular excitation .",
    "it is assumed that the reader has a basic familiarity with statistical equilibrium , radiative transfer , and molecular spectroscopy . for a summary of radiative transfer techniques and molecular data used in those calculations ,",
    "see van der tak ( 2011 ) and references therein .",
    "the purpose of this tutorial is to quantify and systematize the use of critical density and effective excitation density for dense gas molecular tracers .",
    "we shall use the excitation of two molecules , hco@xmath3  and nh@xmath7 , as examples throughout this tutorial .",
    "figure 1 shows the energy level structure for both molecules .",
    "hco@xmath3  is an abundant linear molecule with a simple @xmath9 electronic ground state meaning that there is zero net electronic spin and zero net electronic angular momentum that could interact with and split the rotational levels of the molecule .",
    "electric dipole selection rules limit transitions to @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath2 ground state rotational transition is a millimeter transition at 89 ghz ( 3.3 mm ) and the frequency of rotational transitions progress linearly into the submillimeter part of the spectrum .",
    "nh@xmath7 is an abundant pyramidal symmetric top molecule with a simple @xmath11 electronic ground state also meaning that there is zero net electronic spin and zero net electronic angular momentum .",
    "the energy levels are designed by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total rotational angular momentum and @xmath14 is the projection of the angular momentum onto the nh@xmath7 symmetry axis",
    ". electric dipole transition do not allow the projected angular momentum to change ( @xmath15 ) . as a results , the energy level structure",
    "is usually organized in k - ladders with each k - ladder designated as either ortho ( @xmath14 = 0 , 3 , 6 , etc . ) or para ( @xmath14 = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , etc . ) due to the spin symmetry required to satisfy fermi - dirac statistics for each rotational energy level .",
    "the plane of three h atoms can tunnel from positions above and below the n atom resulting in inversion splitting of each rotational level ( with symmetry denoted by @xmath16 ) except for levels with @xmath17 for which half of the inversion levels are missing due to the pauli exclusion principle ( see townes & schwalow 1975 for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "electric dipole transitions are allowed between the inversion - split levels with different symmetries and these inversion transitions occur at wavelengths near 1.3 cm ( 24 ghz ) .",
    "since @xmath13 and @xmath14 do not change in a pure inversion transition , the shorthand notation @xmath18 has been adopted . as with hco@xmath3 , there are rotational transition with @xmath10 , but since nh@xmath7 is a lighter molecule than hco@xmath3  ( @xmath19 where i is the moment of inertia of the molecule measured from a coordinate system at the center - of - mass ) , the transitions occur at submillimeter and far - infrared wavelengths . thus , the lowest energy transitions of hco@xmath3  and nh@xmath7 cover a wide range of wavelengths from the centimeter to the far - infrared .",
    "the critical density has traditionally been used as a measure of the density at which a particular transition is excited and is observed at radio wavelengths .",
    "the definition of the critical density is not consistent throughout the literature .",
    "some definitions only consider the two energy levels involved in the transition ( 2 level approximation ) while other definitions use the multi - level nature of collisions to sum over all collisions out of the upper energy level or only from the upper energy level to lower energy levels .",
    "all of the standard definitions assume the molecular emission is optically thin and ignore radiative trapping which is very important and can not be ignored for many commonly observed dense gas tracers ( e.g. hcn @xmath2 , hco@xmath3 @xmath2 , n@xmath4h@xmath3 @xmath2 , etc . ;",
    "see  2.2 ) .",
    "the standard definitions also usually ignore continuum backgrounds ( see  4 ) .",
    "we start by defining the critical density as the density for which the net radiative decay rate from @xmath20 equals the rate of collisional depopulation out of the upper level @xmath21 for a multilevel system .",
    "the net radiative decay rate from @xmath20 is the spontaneous decay rate from @xmath20 plus the stimulated emission rate from @xmath20 minus the absorption rate from @xmath22 .",
    "mathematically , the ratio of rates is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number density ( @xmath25 ) of molecules in the upper level of the transition , @xmath26 is the number density ( @xmath25 ) of molecules in the lower level of the transition , @xmath27 is the number density ( @xmath25 ) of colliding particles ( typically h@xmath4 , h , or e@xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 are the collision rates ( @xmath30 s@xmath31 ) out of level @xmath21 into another level @xmath32 .",

    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the einstein @xmath37 ( s@xmath31 ) and @xmath38 ( erg@xmath31 @xmath39 s@xmath40 ) coefficients related by @xmath41 @xmath42 is the energy density ( erg @xmath25 hz@xmath31 ) of the radiation fields at the frequency of the transition @xmath43 .",
    "the energy density is written in terms of a planck function and is related to the angle and polarization averaged photon occupation number , @xmath44 , by @xmath45 the total energy density can include contributions from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , dust continuum emission from the interstellar radiation field , dust continuum emission local to the molecular cloud , optically thick molecular emission at the frequency @xmath43 , and other continuum and spectral line sources .",
    "we define the optically thin critical density without a background by solving for @xmath27 in equation 1 when @xmath34 and ignoring the stimulated emission and absorption terms : @xmath46 the sum over collision rates in the denominator of equation 4 has been split in two terms depending on whether the collision from level @xmath21 is to an energy level lower in energy ( first sum ) or higher in energy ( second sum ) than level @xmath21 .",
    "upward collision rates are related to downward collision rates using detailed balance by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the kinetic temperature of the collisional partner .",
    "published collision rates ( i.e. the leiden molecular databasemoldata/ ] ; schier et al .",
    "2005 ) quote only downward collision rates .",
    "in the two level approximation , which is widely quoted but rarely appropriate , the sums reduce to a single term such that @xmath49 . as a result",
    ", @xmath50 will always be larger ( usually by at least a factor of a few ) than @xmath51 .",
    "it is instructive to compare how the optically thin critical density compares to the excitation temperature . for a particular transition between levels @xmath20 , the level population",
    "are related to the excitation temperature , @xmath52 , between the two levels by boltzmann s equation @xmath53 the excitation temperature ( and therefore the level populations ) depend on the density of colliding partners ( @xmath27 ) , the gas kinetic temperature of colliding partners ( @xmath48 ) , and the energy density of radiation fields that the molecules are exposed to . the dependence of @xmath52 on the density and gas kinetic temperature for the ground state transitions of ortho and para nh@xmath7 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the only background radiation field assumed in this example is the cmb . at low densities ( @xmath54 @xmath25 ) , the level populations come into equilibrium with the cmb and @xmath52 approaches @xmath55 k. as the density increases , collisions become more important in determining the level populations .",
    "the excitation temperature of @xmath56 centimeter wavelength inversion transition equilibrates to @xmath48 by densities @xmath57 @xmath25 while the submillimeter @xmath58 rotational transition equilibrates to @xmath48 at significantly higher densities ( @xmath59 @xmath25 ) . the general shape of the @xmath52 with @xmath60 curves is a sigmoid curve with stimulated coupling with the background radiation field setting the lower bound at low densities and collisions with colliding partners at @xmath48 setting the upper bound . at densities",
    "where @xmath61 , the level populations are said to be sub - thermally populated .",
    "this is the situation for most of the commonly observed dense gas transitions in the ism .",
    "when @xmath52 approaches @xmath48 , the level populations are said to be thermalized .",
    "curve for nh@xmath7 ( 1,1 ) shows a region of super - thermal excitation ( @xmath62 ) at densities immediately before thermalization for the @xmath63 k curve .",
    "this is due to a bottleneck in radiative transitions , caused by the five orders of magnitude difference between the spontaneous emission rates for the inversion transition and the thz rotational transition into the upper inversion level , resulting in a slight overpopulation of the upper level of the inversion transition .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for higher @xmath48 because upward collisions to the @xmath64 levels are more efficient at high @xmath48 ( see equation 5 ) . ]    at optical wavelengths ( the high frequency limit ) , critical density is interpreted as the density at which an atomic forbidden line is quenched by collisions meaning that a collisional de - excitation occurs before a photon can be generated from spontaneous emission . in the optical , quenching occurs when @xmath52 is thermalized ( @xmath65 ) . at radio wavelengths ( the low frequency limit )",
    "the critical density occurs at different positions along the sigmoid @xmath52 curve for different molecular tracers and different transitions . in the case of the 1.3 cm ( 23.7 ghz ) nh@xmath7 ( 1,1 )",
    "transition , the optically thin critical density is two orders of magnitude below the thermalization density ( figure 2 )",
    ". early radio astronomy observations of molecules such as oh and nh@xmath7 occurred at centimeter wavelengths and since the critical density at these low frequencies is just above the regime where the @xmath52 starts to rise above equilibration with the cmb , critical density was used to indicate the density at which a transition would appear in emission .",
    "as the frequency of the transition increases , the critical density moves farther up the @xmath52 curve .",
    "for the @xmath66 mm ( @xmath67 ghz ) nh@xmath7 @xmath58 transition , the critical density is nearly equal to the density required for thermalization .",
    "millimeter transitions are an intermediate case ; thus , neither the radio interpretation of critical density being the density at which an emission line is excited nor the optical interpretation of critical density being the density at which an emission line is quenched is appropriate .      in reality ,",
    "radiative trapping is very important for many molecular transitions observed in the dense interstellar medium and can not be ignored .",
    "the energy density is then modified using the solution to the equation of radiative transfer to include emission from the molecule at the excitation temperature describing the level populations for a transition from @xmath20 as @xmath68 where  is the solid angle averaged escape fraction ( see chapter 19 of draine 2011 for a derivation ) .",
    "if we multiply the energy density by the conversion factor between einstein @xmath36 and @xmath35 terms from equation 2 , then we find that @xmath69 in the limit that the background radiation can be ignored ( @xmath70 ) , the critical density becomes @xmath71 } { n_j \\sum_{i \\neq j } \\gamma_{ji }   }    \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\frac { a_{jk } \\left [ 1 + ( \\frac{-1}{n_{ph}(t_{ex},\\nu_{jk})})n_{ph}(t_{ex},\\nu_{jk})(1 - \\bar{\\beta } ) \\right ] } { \\sum_{i \\neq j } \\gamma_{ji }   }    \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\frac { \\bar{\\beta } a_{jk } } { \\sum_{i \\neq j } \\gamma_{ji } } \\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing equation 9 with equation 4 , we see that the effect of radiative trapping is to reduce the spontaneous transition rate by the escape fraction @xmath35 ( see scoville & solomon 1974 , goldreich & kwan 1974 ) .    the relationship between  and the line of sight optical depth , @xmath72 , depends on the geometry and kinematics of the region . in the case of a static , uniform density sphere @xmath73 ( osterbrock 1989 ) , while in the case of a spherical cloud with a large velocity gradient @xmath74 ( the lvg or sobolev approximation ) , @xmath75 ( sobolev 1960 , castor 1970 ) . for large optical depths ( @xmath76 ) , the effective spontaneous transition rate",
    "is then given by @xmath77 .",
    "this result has an important effect on the critical density by reducing its value from the optically thin value .",
    "the most commonly observed transition of molecular gas is @xmath78co @xmath2 .",
    "the optically thin critical density at @xmath79 k is @xmath80 @xmath25 ; however , since @xmath78co @xmath2 has optical depths that are typically more than a factor of @xmath81 in molecular clouds ( and usually much higher ) , it is easy to observe strong lines ( @xmath82 k km / s ) in gas that has densities @xmath83 @xmath25 .",
    "optical trapping is so important for co that it does not make sense to use the optically thin critical density .",
    "commonly observed lines of dense gas tracers in cores and clumps also tend to be optically thick .",
    "the upper left panel of figure 3 shows the predicted optical depth of hco@xmath3  @xmath2 through @xmath84 at different densities from a simple ( single density , single temperature ) radiative transfer model predicting that these transition are expected to be very optically thick over a wide range of densities .",
    "observations support this prediction .",
    "for example , several hundred high - mass clumps mapped in the malt90 galactic survey have a median optical depth of @xmath85 for the hco@xmath3  @xmath2 transition ( hoq et al .",
    "clumps observed in the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ) in the higher frequency transition hco@xmath3  @xmath86 have an average @xmath87 ( shirley et al .",

    ", the analytically calculated critical densities using the optically thin approximation ( equation 4 ) are systematically biased toward higher densities by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "hco@xmath3  is not unique as most commonly observed dense gas tracers ( i.e. hcn , cs , n@xmath4h@xmath3 , etc . ) in the dense , cold neutral medium are typically both sub - thermally populated ( @xmath61 ) and optically thick ( also see plume et al .",
    "1997 , gerner et al .",
    "2014 ) . in practice , to properly estimate the optical depth , a coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium calculation must be performed to find the level populations upon which the optical depth depends ( since @xmath88 along the line - of - sight @xmath89 ) .",
    "since the escape fraction depends nonlinearly with column density ( for modest optical depths ) , nonlinearly with geometry , and nonlinearly with gas kinetic temperature , it is difficult to make a simple tabulation of a  correction to @xmath51 .",
    "it is possible to detect strong ( @xmath6 k km / s ) molecular lines at densities well below the critical density ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "an alternative definition has been developed to trace the effective density at which a modest line intensity is observed that is based on radiative transfer calculations with reasonable assumptions about the column density and gas kinetic temperature of the region ( evans 1999 ) .",
    "the effective excitation density is defined as @xmath90 the density which results in a molecular line with an integrated intensity of @xmath6 k km / s .",

    "it is important to note that the effective excitation density is based on a simple empirical criterion and is not based on @xmath34 or any specific ratio of radiative rates to collisional depopulation rates .",
    "does however account for the effects of radiative trapping .",
    "the original definition presented in evans ( 1999 ) defined @xmath94 as the density resulting in @xmath95 k line and used a lvg radiative transfer code to calculate @xmath94 .",
    "we shall use the radiative transfer code radex ( van der tak et al .",
    "2007 ) with the escape probability formalism for a static , uniform density sphere , with the cmb as the only background radiation field , and with h@xmath4 as the dominant collision partner for all calculations .",
    "the definition in equation 12 is approximately equivalent to the evans 1999 definition when a fwhm linewidth of 1 km / s is assumed in radex calculations",
    ".      the column density of the observed molecule and the gas kinetic temperature of the colliding partner must be assumed in order to calculate .",
    "the sensitivity of  to these assumptions is explored in figure 3 for the hco@xmath3  molecule . at lower column densities , a higher",
    "is required to produce a @xmath6 k km / s line . as the column density increases by an order of magnitude , the   decreases by almost exactly an order of magnitude . the effective excitation density is inversely",

    "this simple scaling proportionality breaks down for @xmath98 @xmath25 and the relationship between  and @xmath99 becomes noticeably non - linear ( see the @xmath79 k curve for hco@xmath3  @xmath84 in the bottom left panel of figure 3 ) . in those cases , a new radex model should be run to scale tabulated results to a new column density .",
    "the dependence of  to @xmath48 is nonlinear and more sensitive at low kinetic temperatures ( @xmath100 k ) due to the inefficiency of upward collisions at lower @xmath48 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "an order of magnitude higher  is required to make a @xmath6 k km / s line for @xmath79 k than at @xmath63 k for hco@xmath3  @xmath86 .",
    "this sensitivity is due to the exponential dependence from upward collisional rates ( equation 4 ) and becomes more pronounced when the upper energy level is significantly higher than @xmath48 ( i.e. the effect is stronger for @xmath84 vs. @xmath2 at @xmath100 k because @xmath101 k for j = 4 vs. @xmath102 k for j = 1 ) .",

    "high @xmath123 transitions for species such as nh@xmath7 , hcn , hco@xmath3 , and n@xmath4h@xmath3   will be undefined at low gas kinetic temperatures @xmath145 k ) .",
    "another problem with the standard definition of @xmath94 is that the more complex the spectrum of a molecule ( e.g. a heavy asymmetric top molecule ) , the less likely a particular transition will attain enough level population to produce a @xmath6 k km / s emission line . for instance , no transitions of hnco have intensities greater than @xmath6 k km / s for the observed median column density of @xmath146 ( gerner et al .",

    "one solution is to reduce the @xmath6 k km / s criterion , ultimately , the choice for this criterion is arbitrary , but unless all researchers agree to use the same criterion , @xmath94 could not be compared among different papers and for different species .",
    "the upper right panel of figure 3 shows the non - linear sensitivity of the integrated intensity for different transitions of hco@xmath3   with density .",
    "as the integrated intensity criterion is lowered , the curves flatten with @xmath27 indicating that a smaller decrease in the criterion results in a larger decrease in @xmath94 .",
    "these problems limit the utility of @xmath94 compared to @xmath51 which can always be calculated if collision rates are known .",

    "the ratio of the rate of stimulated emission from @xmath20 due to the cmb to spontaneous emission is given by @xmath148 this ratio is @xmath149 for the nh@xmath7 ( j , k = j ) inversion transitions and is a modest @xmath150 at 90 ghz ( 3.3 mm ) , near the frequency of the fundamental transitions of commonly observed dense gas tracers ( e.g. hco@xmath3 , hcn , hnc , n@xmath4h@xmath3 ) .",

    "interesting examples of the interaction of low frequency transitions with the cmb are the k - doublet transitions of ortho - h@xmath4co ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 , etc . ) .",
    "the @xmath157 ghz ( @xmath158 cm ) @xmath155 transition has a stimulated emission rate to spontaneous emission rate ratio of @xmath159 . since the statistical weights of the two level are identical , the absorption rate from the lower level is identical to the stimulated emission rate from the upper level .",
    "this line is typically observed in absorption for densities @xmath160 @xmath25 ( mangum et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the absorption is created by the lowest energy level ( @xmath161 ) having a collisionally - induced overpopulation that results in absorption against the cmb ( @xmath162 ) over a wide range of physical conditions ( evans 1975 , garrison 1975 ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath163 gives a ridiculously low value of @xmath164 @xmath25 at @xmath79 k. clearly in cases such as these , the simple definition of critical density fails and more sophisticated radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium calculations that include the cmb background are required .",
    "in addition to the cmb , dust continuum backgrounds from the galactic interstellar radiation field and from emission local to the cloud can be important in modifying the level populations . the main effect of dust continuum emission on our definition of critical density is to introduce a new stimulated rate out of level @xmath21 to higher energy levels , @xmath32 .",
    "the energy density is now the energy density for optically thin dust emission @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the dust optical depth at the frequency of the @xmath167 transition and @xmath168 is the isothermal dust temperature ( see equation 4 of shirley et al .",
    "2011 for a derivation of the equivalent isothermal dust temperature at a given frequency in sources with density and temperature gradients ) .",
    "we only need to consider transitions between @xmath167 that are allowed by electric dipole selection rules because the einstein @xmath169 for absorption of @xmath170 is directly proportional to the einstein @xmath171 for spontaneous emission of @xmath167 ( see equation 2 ) . for many simple molecules ( hco@xmath3 , n@xmath4h@xmath3 , hcn , cs , nh@xmath7 , etc . )",
    "there is only one electric dipole permitted transition from @xmath21 into the upper state @xmath32 that needs to be considered .",
    "the ratio of the rate at which this absorption from @xmath170 occurs to the spontaneous rate for the original @xmath20 transition is @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the mean mass per h@xmath4 molecule ( see kauffmann et al .",
    "2008 ) , @xmath174 is the h@xmath4 column density ( cm@xmath40 ) , and @xmath176 is dust opacity ( @xmath177/gram of gas ) at the frequency of the @xmath170 absorption . the ratio of rates in equation 16 is linear proportional to the h@xmath4 column density and increases non - linearly with dust temperature .    for the following examples ,",
    "we calculate the ratio of rates in equation 16 assuming a h@xmath4 column density of @xmath178 @xmath25 ( corresponding to @xmath179 mag ) , a gas mass to dust mass ratio of @xmath180 , and ossenkopf & henning opacities for coagulated grains with thin ice mantles ( oh5 , ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) that are appropriate for dense cores . for the nh@xmath7 ( 1,1 )",
    "transition , the upper level is radiatively coupled to the @xmath181 level via a 1.168 thz ( @xmath182 @xmath183 m ) far - infrared transition ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "if nh@xmath7 is bathed in a dust continuum of @xmath81 k , the stimulated rate of absorption out of the upper inversion level is four times the spontaneous rate of the ( 1,1 ) transition .",
    "this high ratio is partially driven by the ratio of spontaneous rates between the terahertz transition and the centimeter inversion transition which is @xmath184 .",
    "the net effect is that  becomes larger as the energy density from dust continuum increases .",
    "when the upper level of a low frequency transition is radiatively coupled to far - infrared transitions , the absorption from dust continuum is an important rate that should not be ignored .",
    "this is the case for the centimeter transitions of molecules such as nh@xmath7 , oh , and ch .",
    "the effects of dust continuum radiation are significantly less for the lowest energy transitions of simple linear molecules . for the @xmath185 ghz ( 1.1 mm ) hco@xmath3  @xmath86 transition at @xmath81",
    "k , the ratio of rates is @xmath186 . at 50 k",
    ", the ratio of rates rises to a meager @xmath187 .",
    "these very low ratios indicate that the absorption due to dust continuum emission is not important for the level populations associated with millimeter transitions of linear molecules such as hco@xmath3 , hcn , cs , and n@xmath4h@xmath3 .",
    "we have only considered the rotational levels of the molecule , but there can also be coupling between the radiation field and vibrational levels or electronic levels of the molecule that can effect the level populations of the ground vibrational state rotational levels .",
    "a mid - infrared continuum can pump the molecule from the ground vibrational state into an excited vibrational state which then radiatively decays via ro - vibrational transitions .",
    "for example , the hcn and hnc molecules have bending modes ( @xmath188 ) that can be excited by mid - infrared pumping at @xmath189 @xmath183 m and @xmath190 @xmath183 m respectively . in environments where such pumping may be important ( i.e. the inner envelope of high - mass protostars or near an agn ) ,",
    "the level populations can be affected by mid - infrared pumping . in these cases ,",
    "more sophisticated radiative transfer models are needed .",
    "in this tutorial , @xmath51 and  are defined and their properties analyzed .",
    "the values for @xmath51 and  are calculated for multiple transitions of 12 commonly observed dense molecular gas species in table 1 .",
    "inversely depends on the choice of column density and increases non - linearly as gas kinetic temperatures are lowered ( @xmath100 k ) .",
    "we have estimated the reference column density for difference species listed in table 1 from surveys of cores and clumps in the milky way .",
    "the  quoted can be easily scaled to another column density using equation 13 .    since the definition of  is arbitrary ( the @xmath6 k km / s criteria ) and does not depend on a specific ratio of radiative rates to collisional depopulation rates ( c.f . @xmath34 for the definition of @xmath33 ) , it is seductive to use @xmath51 to characterize the density at which a transition is excited as it can be analytically calculated ; however , @xmath51 does not account for radiative trapping which can easily lower the effective critical density by more than an order of magnitude for commonly observed dense gas tracers such as hco@xmath3  @xmath2 , hcn @xmath2 , n@xmath4h@xmath3  @xmath2 , etc .",
    "the combination of @xmath122 and radiative trapping that generate a @xmath6 k km / s line lower  by @xmath191 orders of magnitude relative to @xmath51 for many commonly observed millimeter and submillimeter lines .",
    "furthermore ,  can account for abundance or column density differences to better differentiate the excitation density of different species than @xmath51 ( i.e. hco@xmath3  vs. n@xmath4h@xmath3  or isotpologues vs. the main species ) .",
    "overall , the effective excitation density gives a better estimate of the range of densities at which a modest ( 1 k km / s ) molecular line can be observed ; however , use of @xmath94 has the disadvantages that an appropriate column density must be determined for the observations of interest and that it is not defined for all transitions ( in particular when @xmath8 ) and for all species ( e.g. hnco , ch@xmath7cho , etc . ) .",
    "@xmath51 and  provide only rough estimates of the densities traced and should not be over - interpreted .",
    "more sophisticated tools such as the contribution function ( tafalla et al .",
    "2006 ) may be used to determine the various contributions to the observed line profile along the line of sight ( see pavlyuchenkov et al .",
    "2008 for a detailed analysis of these techniques ) .",
    "ultimately , if one wants to understand their observed spectra , radiative transfer modeling with publicly available codes are a fast and efficient way to determine the physical properties of a region .",

    "<S> the optically thin critical densities and the effective excitation densities to produce a 1 k km / s ( or @xmath0 jy km / s @xmath1 ) spectral line are tabulated for 12 commonly observed dense gas molecular tracers . </S>",

    "<S> critical densities for commonly observed dense gas transitions in molecular clouds ( i.e. hcn @xmath2 , hco@xmath3 @xmath2 , n@xmath4h@xmath3 @xmath2 ) are typically @xmath5 orders of magnitude larger than effective excitation densities because the standard definitions of critical density do not account for radiative trapping and @xmath6 k km / s lines are typically produced when radiative rates out of the upper energy level of the transition are faster than collisional depopulation . </S>",
    "<S> the use of effective excitation density has a distinct advantage over the use of critical density in characterizing the differences in density traced by species such as nh@xmath7 , hco@xmath3 , n@xmath4h@xmath3 , and hcn as well as their isotpologues ; but , the effective excitation density has the disadvantage that it is undefined for transitions when @xmath8 , for low molecular column densities , and for heavy molecules with complex spectra ( i.e. ch@xmath7cho ) . </S>"
