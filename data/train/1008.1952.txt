    "the study of integrable systems on the space - time lattice has , over the past decades , developed into a major area of research .",
    "the early examples of integrable lattice systems , i.e. partial difference equations ( p@xmath0es ) on two- or higher - dimensional grids , go back to the mid 1970s and early 1980s , when the research was focused on discretizing known continuous soliton systems ( ablowitz & ladik 1976 , hirota 1977 , date _",
    "_ 1982,1983 , nijhoff _ et al .",
    "_ 1983 , quispel _ et al .",
    "however , in recent years the focus has shifted to studying these equations on their own merit , since they exhibit the key integrability aspects in a more lucid way than their continuous counterparts , and often can be thought of as more generic systems than the corresponding differential equations which can be retrieved by appropriate continuum limits .",
    "it has emerged that one of the key integrability aspects of lattice equations is the property of multidimensional consistency , i.e. , the property that one can impose p@xmath0es of the same form ( differing only by a choice of the so - called lattice parameters ) in different pairs of perpendicular directions of a multidimensional lattice in which the two - dimensional grids are embedded ( nijhoff & walker 2001 , bobenko & suris 2002 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as the analogue of the existence of infinite hierarchies of pdes associated with an integrable nonlinear evolution equation , such as the kdv equation . in some sense multidimensional consistency",
    "implies that the `` integrable system '' is not really a single p@xmath0e but comprises all members of the parameter - family of equations compatible on the multidimensional lattice ( nijhoff _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . using this property a classification of two - dimensional scalar integrable lattice systems",
    "was given , in the affine - linear case , by adler , bobenko and suris ( 2003 ) resulting in what is hereafter referred to as the abs list . although we shall refer to the equations in the list as the `` abs equations '' , which are given in the appendix , several examples in the list , notably lattice systems of kdv type ( associated with discretizations of the kdv and related pdes ) , were already known in the literature , cf .",
    "nijhoff & capel ( 1995 ) and references therein .",
    "the most general equation of the abs list was found by adler ( 1998 ) and it contains lattice parameters which are points on an elliptic curve , cf . also adler & suris ( 2004 ) .",
    "considering the integrable system as a system of many equations imposed simultaneously on one and the same ( possibly scalar ) dependent variable , raises the question whether there exists a canonical description which encodes the whole system of equations .",
    "even though most continuous integrable equations can be cast into lagrangian form ( zakharov & mikhailov 1980 ) , the situation for discrete equations is distinctly more complicated and , in fact , the first lagrangian for a quadrilateral equation was given in capel _",
    "furthermore , the usual least - action principle only provides one variational equation per component of the dependent variable .",
    "lobb & nijhoff ( 2009 ) provided the first proposal on how to achieve a variational description of the multidimensionally consistent system of lattice equations , based on the idea of lagrangian multi - forms .",
    "in fact , the proposal is to consider action functionals in terms of discrete lagrange 2-forms @xmath1 given by @xmath2 = \\sum_\\sigma{\\cal{l } } = \\sum_{\\sigma_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{n})\\in\\sigma}{{\\cal{l}}_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{n})},\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a field configuration of a dependent variable @xmath4 depending on lattice sites labelled by @xmath5 of a lattice of arbitrary dimension @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes a quadrilateral surface , composed of a connected configuration of quadrilaterals , embedded in the @xmath8-dimensional grid .",
    "the least - action principle formulated in lobb & nijhoff ( 2009 ) imposes that @xmath9 attains a critical point not only with regard to the infinitesimal variations of the field variables @xmath3 for a given chosen surface @xmath7 , but also with regard to the geometry of the independent variables , by imposing surface independence of the action for the solutions of the euler - lagrange ( el ) equations .",
    "the latter requirement is equivalent to stating that the lagrangians @xmath10 , viewed as 2-forms associated with the quadrilaterals that compose the surface , have to be closed forms subject to the el equations .",
    "it is this property that makes the choice of lagrangians _",
    "admissable _ and which immediately implies multidimensional consistency of the system of equations arising from the el equations on each choice of surface @xmath7 ( fixing , if necessary , boundaries ) .",
    "remarkably , this closure property could be established for well - chosen lagrangians for equations in the abs list , either by direct computation ( as was done in lobb & nijhoff 2009 ) or by general principles ( bobenko & suris 2010 ) .",
    "furthermore , lagrangians possessing the closure property were found in the case of multi - component systems ( lobb & nijhoff 2010 ) and higher - dimensional systems of kp type ( lobb _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) .",
    "the phenomenon of multidimensional consistency is not restricted to the discrete case of lattice equations . in nijhoff _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) the novel class of non - autonomous pdes was introduced which are the equations of the same dependent variable appearing in the lattice equations but viewed now as a function of a pair of ( continuous ) lattice parameters , denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the so - called _ generating pde _ of the kdv hierarchy , i.e. a pde which generates all the equations in the kdv hierarchy by systematic expansion with respect to the lattice parameters , arises as the el equations  @xmath12   from a simple lagrangian given by @xmath13 in lobb & nijhoff ( 2009 ) it was also shown that this continuous lagrangian can be viewed as a closed 2-form , on solutions of the el equations , subject to a three - dimensional constraint on the solutions .",
    "thus , a similar multidimensional least - action principle in terms of a continuous action functional @xmath14 \\,= \\,\\int_\\sigma\\!\\!{\\mathcal{l } } \\,=\\,\\int_{\\sigma } \\sum _ { i < j } { { \\cal{l}}_{ij}\\ , \\rd\\alpha_{i}\\wedge \\rd\\alpha_{j}}\\ ] ] which involves continuous lagrange 2-forms @xmath1 depending on the fields @xmath15 and on surfaces @xmath7 with coordinates given by the vector @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , can be formulated in the continuous case for certain pdes associated with kdv type lattice equations . in order to avoid the difficulty stemming from the fact that the scalar lagrangian , and consequently also the el equation , is of higher order it is natural to formulate the lagrange structure to that for a system of lower - order equations , which actually emerge naturally from the corresponding lax pair . in fact , such systems of pdes were subsequently established for all equations in the abs list through symmetry analysis ( tsoubelis & xenitidis 2009 ) and as a specific example of the construction we can mention the following coupled system of pdes , corresponding to h1 , h2 and q1 : @xmath18 it was derived in tsoubelis & xenitidis ( 2009 ) along with its lax pair , where @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote a triple of dependent variables .",
    "it is worth mentioning that system ( [ h1etc - sys ] ) with @xmath21 was first given in nijhoff _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) in relation to h1 and was derived from a reduction of the anti - self dual yang - mills equations in tongas _",
    "( 2001 ) . in the present paper",
    "we will derive the lagrange structure for the general class of systems of the form  @xmath22   such that the el equations , when varying with respect to all three dependent variables , are satisfied on solutions of the systems like . in this case the lagrangian reads @xmath23 and one can show directly , without assuming further constraints on the higher - dimensional embedding , that this lagrangian obeys the continuous version of the closure relation @xmath24 the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first give in section 2 a universal description of the lagrange structure of affine - linear quadrilateral equations .",
    "what is important here is that the lagrangians can actually be systematically derived from some basic assumptions , such as a 3-point form of the lagrange function and the kleinian symmetry of the quadrilateral equation .",
    "this leads to an integral form of the so - called three - leg representation of the quadrilateral equation , cf .",
    "( 2003 ) . in section 3",
    ", we specialize to the abs case , in which we have the symmetries of the square , imposing dependence on lattice parameters in a covariant way .",
    "we prove that the corresponding lagrangians , in the integral form , obey the closure property . in section 4 , we briefly present the construction of the universal system of pdes associated with the abs list , which was given in tsoubelis & xenitidis ( 2009 ) , and we prove the multidimensional consistency of these systems . finally in section 5",
    "we establish the corresponding lagrangian structures , both for the systems of pdes as well as for the differential - difference equations which are defined in terms of the symmetry generators , and show that the universal lagrange structure for the system of pdes obey the closure relation .",
    "thus , we believe this completes the full picture of the lagrange structure for multidimensionally consistent equations associated with the affine - linear scalar quad - lattices .",
    "we first focus on the lagrangian formulation of affine - linear quadrilateral equations on the two - dimensional lattice , and show that under very general assumptions there is an almost unique lagrangian description .",
    "the members of the class of equations we consider will be denoted by @xmath25 and involve the values of a function @xmath4 at four neighbouring points of an elementary quadrilateral .",
    "the labels @xmath26 , @xmath27 refer , for the time being , to two fixed directions of a @xmath28 lattice .",
    "the general notation we use here , adapted to cover also the situation we will encounter in the next section , is as follows . in principle , the unknown function @xmath4 of the equations will , in due course , be considered as functions of an arbitrary number of discrete variables , denoted by @xmath29 , and there will be an equal number of continuous variables @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 will be the dependent variable of a system of equations in an arbitrary number of dimensions . in that context , the shifted values of @xmath4 will be denoted by indices , e.g. @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the shift operator in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "occasionally we will also use the difference operator @xmath34 , which is defined by @xmath35 .",
    "the main integrability property of the systems considered in the following sections is multidimensional consistency .",
    "this means that all of them can be extended in a compatible way in higher dimensions , according to the following definition :    [ mdc - dis ] let @xmath36 denote a quadrilateral difference equation , to be solved for a dependent variable @xmath4 . imposing the dependence of @xmath4 on a third discrete variable @xmath37 such that @xmath38 if the three different ways to evaluate the triply shifted value @xmath39 lead to the same result , then we call the equation defined by @xmath40 multidimensionally consistent .",
    "however , in the present section we will only make statements about a single equation of the form , in terms of two fixed independent variables @xmath29 , @xmath41 , and their corresponding lattice shifts .",
    "the following properties of the function @xmath40 are assumed here :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 is an affine - linear polynomial depending explicitly on all the arguments , that is @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath40 is irreducible , meaning that @xmath40 can not be factorized and presented as a product of two polynomials ; 3 .",
    "@xmath40 possesses the kleinian symmetry , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath40 satisfies property 1 one can define , in principle , six different bi - quadratic polynomials in terms of @xmath40 and its derivatives , and four quartic polynomials through the application of the following double - sided wronskian , respectively discriminant operator , defined by their actions on an arbitrary polynomial function @xmath47 in the following ways , eg .",
    "( 2009 ) : @xmath48    furthermore , the irreducibility of @xmath40 guarantees that none of the polynomials obtained from @xmath40 by acting on it by the operator @xmath49 for all pairs of arguments @xmath50 of @xmath40 , is identically zero .",
    "the kleinian symmetry ( [ gen - d4sym ] ) implies that these bi - quadratic polynomials are symmetric and take the same form when we apply the operator @xmath49 for mutually exclusive pairs of arguments .",
    "this is expressed by the following lemma , which can be easily established by exploiting the definitions and symmetry relations :    due to the kleinian symmetry , the following polynomials assigned to an elementary quadrilateral are the same for functions depending on complementary pairs of variables :    1 .",
    "symmetric bi - quadratic polynomials assigned to the edges of the quadrilateral : @xmath51 2 .",
    "symmetric bi - quadratic polynomials assigned to the diagonals of the quadrilateral : @xmath52 3 .",
    "quartic polynomials associated with the vertices of the quadrilateral : @xmath53    furthermore , between the bi - quadratic polynomials the following relations hold on solutions of equation ( [ gen - eq ] ) . @xmath54    with the above definitions we are now in a position to write an integral form of the three - leg formula for an affine - linear quadrilateral equations of the type subject to the properties 1)-3 ) given above .",
    "the usual three - leg formula was given in adler _",
    "( 2003 ) on a case - by - case basis . in the monograph by bobenko & suris ( 2008 ) a result by adler",
    "is cited as an exercise , of which the following is a slight generalization :    let @xmath40 possess the properties 1)-3 ) given above .",
    "then the equation @xmath55 holds on solutions of @xmath36 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are arbitrary and where the function @xmath58 is defined through the relation @xmath59 .",
    "the proof is straightforward using implicit differentiation with respect to the variables @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . substituting @xmath60 , since we require relation ( [ 3leg - gen ] ) to hold on solutions of @xmath36 , and denoting the resulting left - hand side of ( [ 3leg - gen ] ) by @xmath61",
    ", we can easily prove that @xmath62 is actually independent of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and also of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "to show this it is sufficient to show that @xmath63 through implicit differentiation .",
    "computing the derivative of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath56 we obtain : @xmath64 since @xmath58 is determined by @xmath4 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 through the equation @xmath65 .",
    "implicit differentiation of the latter yields @xmath66 which holds on solutions of @xmath65 by taking into account the definitions @xmath67 the combination of ( [ r - der - x ] ) and ( [ z - der - x ] ) leads to the result @xmath63 . in precisely the same fashion it can be established that @xmath68 , where in the latter two we make use of the substitution for @xmath69 as mentioned above . since as a consequence @xmath61",
    "does not depend on @xmath56,@xmath57 , we can chose the latter arbitrarily , leading to the conclusion that  @xmath70  , where the latter expression vanishes due to the integration limits and taking into account that for @xmath71 , @xmath72 we have that @xmath73 .",
    "equation ( [ 3leg - gen ] ) suggests that the three leg form can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 where the indefinite integrals denote the primitive ( anti - derivative ) functions of the integrands with respect to the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath69 , respectively , and the integration constant in each integral is assumed to be independent of the other integration variables .",
    "lagrangians for the generalized three - leg formula can be obtained by simple integration over the remaining variable @xmath4 , but there is a stronger result that holds .",
    "in fact , it turns out that under the assumption of the three - point form of the lagrange function , as was done in lobb & nijhoff ( 2009 ) , one can actually derive in an almost unique way the form of the lagrange function for the affine - linear quadrilateral equations .",
    "this is expressed in    [ lagr - d4-prop ] let @xmath77 be an irreducible , affine linear and kleinian - symmetric polynomial .",
    "then , up to a freedom of having a multiplicative constant , and an additive constant , a three - point lagrangian of the form @xmath78 of the equation @xmath79 , is given by : @xmath80 integrals denote anti - derivatives of the integrands which are determined up to constants , i.e. independent of @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "let us suppose that we are looking for a function @xmath78 such that @xmath81 on solutions of the equation @xmath79 .",
    "first we differentiate the above equation with respect to @xmath82 by taking into account that @xmath83 is determined by the equation @xmath84 .",
    "this yields @xmath85 where @xmath86 on solutions of equation @xmath84 .",
    "thus , substituting the latter into ( [ el - eqs-2 ] ) and shifting forward in the @xmath26 direction the resulting relation , one arrives at @xmath87 in the same fashion , the derivative of ( [ el - eqs-1 ] ) with respect to @xmath88 leads to @xmath89 a third equation follows from the compatibility of ( [ el - eqs-3a],[el - eqs-3b ] ) , namely @xmath90    the solution of the system of equations ( [ el - eqs-3a][el - eqs-3c ] ) is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a constant , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are arbitrary functions of their arguments and double integrals denote anti - derivatives .    to determine the unspecified functions involved in @xmath96 , we write out explicitly the euler - lagrange equations ( [ el - eqs-1 ] ) using ( [ el - eqs-4 ] ) and taking into account ( [ 3leg-1][h0 - 3leg ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath97 , where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath4 . from the latter equation ,",
    "one of the unspecified functions can be defined in terms of the remaining ones .",
    "we choose to solve it for @xmath98 leading to @xmath99 which is defined up to an additive constant .    substituting back into ( [ el - eqs-4 ] ) ,",
    "it is not difficult to see that the terms involving functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be written as a total difference , and since their variational derivative does not contribute to the el equations , they can be omitted from @xmath100 .",
    "hence , up to a multiplicative constant and an additive constant , @xmath100 is given by ( [ lagr - d4 ] ) .",
    "in all of the above formulas , primitives are determined up to constants .",
    "one can fix this freedom during the derivation of the lagrangian by choosing an arbitrary function @xmath101 along with its shifts as lower limits in the integrals involved in ( [ el - eqs-4 ] ) .",
    "the derivation determines the remaining terms in the latter leading to @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath58 are solutions of the equations @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "lagrangian ( [ lagr - d4 ] ) possesses the klein symmetry in the sense that three different lagrangians can be derived from this one by applying the interchanges implied by the klein symmetry .    to make this statement clear",
    ", we apply the changes ( [ gen - d4sym ] ) to ( [ lagr - d4 ] ) .",
    "the first interchange , i.e. @xmath106 , which leaves invariant the equation @xmath79 , when applied to @xmath100 leads to @xmath107 , which is another lagrangian of equation @xmath79 . additionally , applying the changes @xmath108 to ( [ lagr - d4 ] ) one arrives at another lagrangian , namely @xmath109 .",
    "finally , combining these two symmetries one can derive a third lagrangian which has the form @xmath110 .    in bobenko & suris ( 2010 ) the proof of the closure relation",
    "makes use of a fundamental property of the lagrangian , which in the context of the present approach can be generalized and understood as the following    all the above langrangians are defined up to an additive constant and , by choosing it appropriately , their sum is zero on solutions of the equation @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath111    to prove that the sum is a constant on solutions of @xmath79 , it is sufficient to prove that its derivatives with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 vanish .",
    "indeed , differentiating it with respect to @xmath4 or the single shifted values of @xmath4 and taking into account that @xmath69 depends on @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 through the equation @xmath79 , one easily verifies that the sum of the four lagrangians is constant on solutions of @xmath79 .",
    "among the members of the class of equations studied in the previous section are the ones possessing the symmetries of the square , or d4 symmetry .",
    "these equations may depend on two lattice parameters , denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath112 respectively , and their defining polynomial will be denoted by @xmath113 , or simply by @xmath114 , in order to make this dependence explicit .",
    "since the lattice parameters are assigned to the edges of a plaquette , the symmetries of the square imply that the interchange of @xmath19 and @xmath20 must be followed by a mutual interchange of the lattice parameters , i.e. @xmath115    the abs equations , which are given in [ fgk ] , belong to this subclass and depend explicitly on the lattice parameters .",
    "they are multidimensionally consistent , cf .",
    "definition [ mdc - dis ] , and this property depends essentially on the appearance of the lattice parameters in them .",
    "these two characteristics of the abs equations have the following consequences .",
    "first of all , the polynomials @xmath116 assigned to the edges can be factorized as @xmath117 the function @xmath118 is antisymmetric , i.e. @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is a symmetric bi - quadratic polynomial of @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the index @xmath26 denotes that it depends only on the lattice parameter @xmath30 .    moreover , polynomial @xmath121 is symmetric and bi - quadratic with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and symmetric with respect to the lattice parameters .",
    "it is more convenient for the analysis of the abs equations in the following sections to introduce the function @xmath122 which is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of indices : @xmath123 .",
    "again , the indices denote the dependence on the lattice parameters and not shifts in the corresponding lattice directions . functions @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 can be found also in [ fgk ] .",
    "finally , the factorization of polynomials @xmath116 implies that the three leg form for these equations can be written as @xmath127 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are arbitrary and @xmath58 is any solution of @xmath128 .    in this case , the function @xmath129 ( [ h-3leg ] ) is antisymmetric with respect to the interchanges of the indices and is given by @xmath130 similarly , the function @xmath131 ( [ h0 - 3leg ] ) takes the following form @xmath132    having introduced through proposition [ lagr - d4-prop ] a lagrangian for the abs equations , we now proceed and prove that it obeys the closure property .",
    "[ lang - clos - rel - abs ] the following function @xmath133 defines a lagrangian for the abs equation @xmath134 , meaning that the el equations are satisfied whenever @xmath135 .",

    ", we will need the following    [ f - omega - relations ] let @xmath143 be any of the polynomials related to the abs equation @xmath134 .",
    "then , the relation @xmath144 holds identically .",
    "similarly , if @xmath145 is any of the diagonal polynomials corresponding to the abs equation @xmath134 , then the following identities hold @xmath146    the identity for @xmath124 follows from the symmetry analysis of the abs equations , ( xenitidis 2009 , mikhailov _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) , and its derivation is given in [ aderivative ] . actually , this relation expresses the fact that the lattice parameters play the role of the continuous `` master symmetry '' parameters .",
    "the same relation can be found in the context of integrable chains of differential  difference equations and their master symmetries ( yamilov 2006 ) .",
    "the relation for @xmath147 can be proven either directly , or , in the case of q1q4 , using the observation that @xmath148 .",
    "we now proceed with the proof of theorem [ lang - clos - rel - abs ] .",
    "since the abs equations belong to a subclass of the family of equations studied in the previous section , the lagrangian ( [ dislag1 ] ) easily follows from ( [ el - eqs-4 ] ) by assuming it to be symmetric with respect to the interchange of indices , choosing the multiplicative constant to be @xmath126 and using relations ( [ h - abs ] , [ omega - abs ] ) .",

    "the derivative of @xmath149 with respect to @xmath69 has the form @xmath154 where the last equality holds on @xmath140 and @xmath141 and their shifts .",

    "the next step is to prove that the closure relation is independent of the lattice parameters .",
