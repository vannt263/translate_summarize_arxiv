    "the field of complex networks has grown in recent years with applications across many scientific and engineering disciplines  @xcite .",
    "network science has generally focused on how topological characteristics of a network affect its structure or performance  @xcite . unlike purely topological networks , spatial networks  @xcite like roadways , pipelines , and the power grid must take physical distance into consideration .",
    "topology offers indicators of the network state , but ignoring the spatial component may neglect a large part of how the network functions  @xcite . for spatial networks in particular , links of different lengths may have different costs affecting their navigability  @xcite and construction  @xcite .",
    "percolation  @xcite provides a theoretical framework to study how robust networks are to failure  @xcite . in traditional bond percolation , each link in the network is independently removed with a constant probability , and it is asked whether or not the network became disconnected .",
    "theoretical studies of percolation generally assume very large networks that are locally treelike , often requiring millions of nodes before finite - size effects are negligible . yet",
    "many physical networks are far from this size ; even large power grids may contain only a few thousand elements .",
    "there is a need to study the robustness of small spatial networks .",
    "microgrids  @xcite are one example .",
    "microgrids are small - area ( 3050 km ) , standalone power grids that have been proposed as a new model for towns and residential neighborhoods in light of the increased penetration of renewable energy sources .",
    "creating small robust networks that are cost - effective will enable easier introduction of the microgrid philosophy to the residential community .",
    "due to their much smaller geographic extent , an entire microgrid can be severely affected by a single powerful storm , such as a blizzard or hurricane , something that is unlikely to happen to a single , continent - wide power grid .",
    "thus building on previous work , we consider how robustness will be affected by spatial and financial constraints .",
    "the goal is to create model networks that are both cost - effective , small in size , and at the same time to understand how robust these small networks are to failures .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : infrastructuremodel ] a previous model of spatial networks is summarized .",
    "section  [ sec : robustphysinf ] contains a brief summary of percolation on networks , and applies these predictions to the spatial networks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelinfrob ] we introduce and study a new model of percolation for spatial networks as an important tool for infrastructure robustness .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] contains a discussion of these results and future work .",
    "in this work we consider a spatial network model introduced by gastner & newman  @xcite , summarized as follows .",
    "a network consists of @xmath0 nodes represented as points distributed uniformly at random within the unit square .",
    "links are then placed between these nodes according to associated construction costs and travel distances .",
    "the construction cost is the total euclidean length of all edges in the network , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the euclidean distance between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the set of undirected links in the network .",
    "this sum represents the capital outlay required to build and maintain the network .",
    "when building the network , the construction cost must be under a specified budget .",
    "meanwhile , the travel distance encapsulates how easy it is on average to navigate the network and serves as an idealized proxy for the functionality of the network .",
    "the degree to which spatial distance influences this functionality is tuned by a parameter @xmath6 via an `` effective '' distance @xmath7 tuning @xmath6 toward 1 represents networks where the cost of moving along a link is strongly * spatial * ( for example , a road network ) while choosing @xmath6 closer to 0 leads to more * non - spatial * networks ( for example , air transportation where the convenience of traveling a route depends more on the number of hops or legs than on the total spatial distance ) . to illustrate the effect of @xmath6",
    ", we draw two example networks in fig .",
    "[ samecoords ] .",
    "finally , the travel distance is defined as the mean shortest effective path length between all pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "taken together , we seek to build networks that minimize travel distance while remaining under a fixed construction budget , i.e.  given fixed node positions , links are added according to the constrained optimization problem @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the set of links in the shortest effective path between nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , according to the effective distances @xmath12 .",
    "this optimization was solved using simulated annealing ( see app .  [ app : optnetdeets ] for details ) with a budget of 10 ( as in  @xcite ) and a size of @xmath13 = 50 nodes .",
    "we focus on such a small number of nodes to better mimic realistic microgrid scales . in this work , to average results , 100 individual network realizations were constructed for each @xmath6 .",
    "influences network topology .",
    "the * non - spatial * case @xmath14 shows long - range hubs due to the lack of restriction on edge distance ; the * spatial * case @xmath15 lacks expensive long distance links leading to a more geometric graph .",
    "as examples , the non - spatial case may correspond to air travel where minimizing the number of flights a traveler takes on a journey is more important than minimizing the total distance flown , while the spatial case may represent a road network where the overall travel distance is more important than the number of roads taken to reach a destination .",
    "[ samecoords ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    an important quantity to understand in these networks is the distribution of euclidean link lengths .",
    "if edges were placed randomly between pairs of nodes , the lengths would follow the square line picking distribution with mean distance @xmath16  @xcite . instead",
    ", the optimized network construction makes long links costly and we observe ( fig .  [ gammadistru ] ) that the probability distribution @xmath17 of euclidean link length @xmath18 after optimization is well explained by a gamma distribution , meaning the probability that a randomly chosen edge has length @xmath18 is @xmath19 with shape and scale parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "a gamma distribution is plausible for the distribution of link lengths because it consists of two terms , a power law and an exponential cutoff .",
    "this product contains the antagonism between the minimization and the constraint in eq .  :",
    "since longer links are generally desirable for reducing the travel distance , a power law term with positive exponent is reasonable , while the exponential cutoff captures the need to keep links short to satisfy the construction budget and the fact that these nodes are bounded by the unit square .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ gammadistru ] .",
    "the network parameters were chosen under conditions that were general enough to apply to any small network , for instance a microgrid in a small residential neighborhood .",
    "the choices of 50 nodes and a budget of 10 were also made in line with previous studies of this network model to balance small network size with a budget that shows the competition between travel distance minimization and construction cost constraint  @xcite .     between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are well explained for all @xmath6 by gamma distributions , i.e.  @xmath22 ( * a * ) maximum likelihood estimates of @xmath23 for multiple @xmath6 .",

    "percolation theory on networks studies how networks fall apart as they are sampled .",
    "for example , in traditional bond percolation each link in the network is independently retained with probability @xmath25 ( equivalently , each link is deleted with probability @xmath26 ) .",
    "this process represents random errors in the network .",
    "the percolation threshold @xmath27 is the value of @xmath28 where the giant component , the connected component containing the majority of nodes , first appears .",
    "infinite systems exhibit a phase transition at @xmath27 , which becomes a critical point  @xcite . in this work we focus on small * micronetworks",
    "* , a regime under - explored in percolation theory and far from the thermodynamic limit invoked by most analyses . in our finite graphs , we estimate @xmath27 as the value of @xmath28 that corresponds to the largest @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fraction of nodes in the @xmath31 largest connected component ( fig .",
    "[ s1s2 ] ) . in finite systems the second largest component peaks at the percolation threshold ; for @xmath32 the network is highly disconnected and all components are small , while for @xmath33 a giant component almost surely encompasses most nodes and @xmath29 is forced to be small .",
    "note that it is also common to measure the average component size excluding the giant component  @xcite .     and @xmath29 , respectively , as a function of link deletion probability @xmath28 .",
    "in finite systems the percolation threshold @xmath27 can be estimated from the maximum of @xmath29 ( dashed line ) .",
    "this example used optimized networks with @xmath34 .",
    "[ s1s2],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    for the case of uniformly random link removals ( bond percolation ) it was shown that the critical point occurs when @xmath28 is such that @xmath35  @xcite , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the first and second moments of the percolated graph s degree distribution , respectively .",
    "we denote this theoretical threshold as @xmath38 to distinguish this value from the @xmath27 estimated via @xmath29 . computing this theoretical prediction for the optimized networks ( sec .",
    "[ sec : infrastructuremodel ] ) we found @xmath38 between 0.66 and 0.71 for the full range of @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ theoryqcpred ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the derivation of this condition for @xmath38 makes two related assumptions that are a poor fit for these optimized spatial networks .",
    "first , the theoretical model studies networks whose nodes are connected at random .",
    "this assumption does not hold for the constrained optimization ( eq .  ) we study .",
    "second , this calculation neglects loops by assuming the network is very large and at least locally treelike .",
    "for the small , optimized networks we build this is certainly not the case .",
    "these predictions for the critical point @xmath38 do provide a useful baseline to compare to the empirical estimates of @xmath27 via @xmath29 .",
    "we computed this predicted critical point @xmath38 for each @xmath6 finding @xmath38 between 0.660.72 .",
    "the quadratic fit provides a guide for the eye .",
    "[ theoryqcpred],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "the work by gastner and newman  @xcite showed the importance of incorporating spatial distances into the construction of an infrastructure network model . with physical infrastructure",
    "we argue that it is important to also consider spatial distances when estimating how robust a network is to random failures . for example , consider a series of power lines built in a rural area where trees are scattered at random . in a storm trees may fall and damage these lines , and one would expect , all else being equal , that one line built twice as long as another would have twice the chance of a tree falling on it and thus failing .    motivated by this example , an intuitive model for how links fail would require an increasing chance of failure with length .",
    "the simplest model supposes that the failure of a link is directly proportional to length , i.e. , that each unit length is equally likely to fail . with this in mind",
    "we now introduce the following generalization of bond percolation : each link @xmath39 independently fails with probability @xmath40 , where @xmath41 @xmath42 $ ] is a tunable parameter that determines how many edges from @xmath43 to @xmath44 will fail on average , and the parameter @xmath45 controls how distance affects failure probability .",
    "we naturally recover traditional bond percolation ( @xmath46 ) when @xmath47 and @xmath48 corresponds to the case of constant probability per unit length .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ sumryedgeatck ] for example networks illustrating how @xmath49 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath45 .",

    "for example , the variance of @xmath59 is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the beta function . to study this robustness model",
    "we percolate the infrastructure networks by stochastically removing links @xmath39 with probabilities @xmath49 ( eq .  ) for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ s2grid ] we plot @xmath29 vs.  @xmath28 for various combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath6 .",
    "importantly , in all cases @xmath64 , indicating that these networks are less robust than predicted . when comparing the effects of each parameter , @xmath45 has a much greater effect in reducing @xmath27 than @xmath6 ; sampling by distance plays a much greater role in determining robustness than how the network is constructed .        the curves in fig .",
    "[ s2grid ] show @xmath29 for the entire range of @xmath28 ; to study @xmath27 requires examining the peaks of these curves .",

    "@xmath27 ranges from approximately 0.30 to 0.50 .",

    "[ lvlplot ] ) since their construction ( low distance dependence ) is in direct opposition to how links fail ( high distance dependence ) .",
    "even when networks are built with the goal of minimizing physical distances along links ( high @xmath6 ) , the exponent @xmath45 still lowers @xmath27 compared with the theoretical prediction ( highlighted at region * b * ) .",
    "almost any introduction of spatial dependence on link failure ( compare @xmath51 with @xmath67 ) leads to less robust networks .     as a function of @xmath45 and @xmath6",
    "overall , values of @xmath51 always correspond to lower robustness than when @xmath67 and in particular , the percolation threshold , @xmath27 , is lowest near * a * ( @xmath65 ) , while networks are generally most robust when @xmath68 .",
    "the exponent @xmath45 lowers @xmath27 even in geometric networks ( high @xmath6 ) where spatial distance plays a stronger role in the network topology ( region * b * ) .",
    "this matrix was smoothed with a @xmath69 5-pixel gaussian convolution for clarity.[lvlplot ] ]    finally , to better understand why these infrastructure networks are less robust than the theoretical prediction  @xcite , we studied correlations in network structure by computing the mean degree of nearest neighbors @xmath70  @xcite and the mean distance to nearest neighbors @xmath71 , both as functions of node degree @xmath72 . here @xmath73 is the conditional probability that a node of degree @xmath72 has a neighbor of degree @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the conditional probability that a node of degree @xmath72 has a link of length between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . see fig .",

    "therefore , the optimized networks always possess correlated topologies . taken together , fig .",
    "[ knndnn ] shows that , beyond finite - size effects , @xmath38 overestimates @xmath27 because ( i ) these networks are non - random and ( ii ) higher degree nodes tend to have longer links leading to hubs that suffer more damage when @xmath51 .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath78 shows an increasing trend with @xmath72 for decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "these optimized networks are not randomly constructed ; they possess correlations in either network or spatial structure ( or both ) for all @xmath6 .",
    "the above metrics indicate that non - spatial networks form hubs whose longer links are likely to fail with higher probability and cause more damage to the network .",
    "alternatively , more spatially - dependent networks ( higher @xmath6 ) have @xmath78 that depends less on @xmath72 , indicating that link failures are spread somewhat more uniformly across high- and low - degree nodes .",
    "[ knndnn],width=291 ]",
    "a potential application of this model is to designing microgrids .",
    "the microgrid concept , most commonly implemented in military settings , has gained wider popularity with the advent of the smart grid . building a microgrid that is robust to failures while constrained by a budget is important for the widespread adoption of microgrids .",
    "furthermore , the model also brings to light the need to keep in mind that the construction of convenient , long power lines may not be an optimal choice when accounting for the system s robustness .",
    "this may reinforce distributed generation across many buildings , as opposed to the power grid ( traditional utility ) creation of power lines stemming from a centralized cluster of small power plants . a move",
    "toward distributed generation and the decommissioning of the traditional utility may raise the overall stability of the grid .",
    "existing infrastructure can use methods that reduce the power grid s dependence on distance ( effectively lowering @xmath45 ) , such as using towers to raise long - distance transmission lines above trees . distributed generation may be a cost - effective alternative .",
    "of course , the metrics used here are not all - encompassing for quantifying robustness .",
    "additional measures may be used that go beyond the topological connectivity of networks to network functionality and dynamics , including problem - specific analyses  @xcite .",
    "one specific example : it is worth understanding how a spatial network s travel distance may change following link failures , even when a giant component remains .",
    "it is also worth further characterizing fluctuations in , e.g. , @xmath27 that are due to the small size of these micronetworks .    additional future work may include considering the unit square to have differential terrain , changing the cost of edge placement over a continuous gradient .",
    "also , applying the existing model to real infrastructure network data , we may measure robustness of critical networks and have better insight on how to design and improve these structures .",
    "furthermore , in a real power grid nodes do not all have equal roles and thus investigating not only spatially - dependent edge failure but variations in node importance may gain more insight into spatial network robustness .",

    "initially the network is empty . the minimum spanning tree ( mst )",
    "is inserted between these nodes using kruskal s algorithm  @xcite with link weights corresponding to @xmath12 , and the construction cost and travel distance are computed . the spanning tree , which may be modified as optimization progresses , ensures the travel distance is finite when optimization begins .",
    "we find solutions to the constrained optimization problem ( eq .  ) using simulated annealing ( sa ) . at the beginning of each sa step",
    ", an edge is added to the network at random and construction cost and travel distance are recomputed .",
    "if the budget constraint is still satisfied with the addition of this edge , the edge is kept using boltzmann s criterion : the edge is retained if it lowers the travel distance ; if it does not lower the travel distance it is retained with probability @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the change in travel distance due to this change in the network , and @xmath86 acts as the inverse temperature .",
