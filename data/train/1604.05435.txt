    "temperature ( @xmath2 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath3 ) dependence of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is often described as the qcd phase diagram  @xcite , where @xmath3 is related to quark chemical potential @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "investigation of the truth about the qcd phase diagram is quite important not only in hadron physics but also in particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulation as the first principle calculation is a powerful tool of studying the qcd phase diagram .",
    "in fact , recent lqcd simulations provide reliable results in @xmath6 with sophisticated methods  @xcite .",
    "however , these methods are considered not to work well in @xmath7 because of the severe sign problem . to understand the qcd phase diagram there",
    ", many effective models were proposed so far . among the effective models ,",
    "the entanglement polyakov - loop extended nambu  jona - lasinio ( epnjl ) model is one of the most useful effective models  @xcite .",
    "the 2-flavor epnjl model is successful in reproducing lqcd data at zero and imaginary @xmath8 , isospin chemical potential and small real @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in addition , ishii _ et.al .",
    "_ showed very recently that random - phase - approximation calculations based on the epnjl model well reproduce @xmath2 dependence of the meson screening masses calculated by lqcd in both the 2- and 2 + 1-flavor cases  @xcite .    in spite of the success ,",
    "the epnjl model can not treat the baryon degrees of freedom explicitly .",
    "this is a disadvantage of the epnjl model in describing the baryon sector in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "another way of describing all the region of qcd phase diagram is the two phase model ( tpm ) in which the hadron - quark phase transition is assumed to be the first order and the phase boundary is determined by the gibbs criterion  @xcite .",
    "the tpm allows us to use different models for hadron and quark phases .",
    "various methods were proposed and developed so far to describe the hadron phase ; for example , the brueckner - hartree - fock method  @xcite , its relativistic version  @xcite , the variational method  @xcite and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model  @xcite . among them",
    ", we use the rmf model in this paper since it is easy to treat and successful in describing the saturation properties of the nuclear matter .",
    "however , the equation of state ( eos ) strongly depend on the choice of parameters and are quite different , especially above the normal nuclear density @xmath9 .",
    "observations of neutron star ( ns ) may be a key to solve this problem .",
    "recently , two - solar - mass ( @xmath10 ) nss were discovered with high accuracy  @xcite , and steiner _ et.al .",
    "_ yielded the best fitting against various observed mass - radius ( mr ) relations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can judge what version of the rmf model is most reasonable above @xmath9 because mr relation is sensitive to the eos taken .    in the core of heavy nss , it is possible that the hadron - quark phase transition takes place .",
    "the occurrence of the transition depends on stiffness of quark - phase eos , which is sensitive to the strength @xmath11 of the vector - type four - quark interaction in the epnjl model . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , the value of @xmath11 at @xmath12 was determined from lqcd data on the quark number density @xmath13 normalized by its stefan - boltzmann limit @xmath14 ; note that @xmath15 is @xmath4-even and has no finite - volume effect .",
    "the value of @xmath11 obtained in the @xmath12 limit is called @xmath16 in the present paper . as for @xmath15 ,",
    "new lqcd data on @xmath13 was provided by using the extrapolation from the imaginary @xmath8 region to the real one  @xcite .",
    "since lqcd simulations in the imaginary @xmath8 region are free from the sign problem , the numerical errors of the new data are very small compared with the previous one based on the taylor expansion method at real @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that one can determine the value of @xmath16 more sharply .",
    "if the strength @xmath11 is decreasing with increasing the @xmath8 , the possibility that the quark phase exist in the core of ns becomes higher .",
    "however , at present , it is difficult to determine the density - dependence of @xmath17 theoretically .",
    "hence , here , we consider an inverse problem .",
    "when we assume the existence of the quark phase in the core of ns , how does the existence constrain the density - dependence of the strength @xmath11 ? how much should the critical baryon chemical potential of hadron - quark phase transition be ?",
    "in this paper , we first construct reasonable tpms by using lqcd data at @xmath12 as a constraint on quark - phase eos and ns observations as a constraint on both hadron- and quark - phase eos . as a quark part of tpm",
    ", we consider three types of epnjl models ; ( 1 ) the model with no vector - type four - quark interaction , ( 2 ) the model with vector - type four - quark interaction in which the strength @xmath11 is assumed to be constant , i.e. , @xmath18 , and ( 3 ) the model with the vector - type four - quark interaction in which the density - dependent strength @xmath19 is introduced .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is determined from lqcd data on @xmath15 in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath19 is discussed by assuming that the quark phase takes place in the core of ns . as hadron phase models , we take three rmf models , i.e. , tm1  @xcite , nl3  @xcite and the model proposed by maruyama , tatsumi , endo and chiba ( mtec )  @xcite .",
    "we determine which hadron - phase eos is consistent with @xmath10 ns observations and the statistically analyzed mr relation by steiner _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention on the @xmath10 region on the statistically analyzed mr relation , since our interest is whether the hadron - quark phase transition takes place or not in the core of ns and this possibility becomes higher for heavy ns .",
    "we will find that mtec eos well reproduces all the data on mr relation , particularly in the @xmath10 region .",
    "the second best is tm1 eos .",
    "we then pick up mtec and tm1 as hadron - phase eoss and consider six types of tpms , as shown in table  [ tb : table1 ] .",
    "these are classified with the hadron - phase eos , that is , mtec eos as a tpma and tm1 eos as a tpmb . for each class , we take epnjl of type ( 1)(3 ) for the quark - phase eos . by using tpma1tpma3 and tpmb1tpmb3",
    ", we calculate the mr relation and draw the hadron - quark phase transition line in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane . for tpma3 and tpmb3 ,",
    "varying @xmath13 dependence of @xmath19 , we determine the upper bound of the transition line for the quark phase to appear in the core of ns .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we formulate the epnjl model with vector - type four - quark interaction and the rmf model . the prescription of the gibbs criterion is also explained .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to show the numerical results .",

    "next , we select the rmf model through the comparison with the data on mr relation . finally , we construct the tpma1tpma3 and tpmb1tpmb3 . from these models , we draw the upper and lower bounds of hadron - quark phase transition line from the condition that the quark phase takes place in the core of ns . the density - dependence of the vector - type four - quark interaction is also discussed .",
    ".tpms taken in this paper .",

    "the critical baryon chemical potential @xmath0 of the transition at @xmath27 is 1750 mev for tpma1 and 1560 mev for tpmb1 .",
    "if the @xmath16 is positive , the quark - matter eos becomes stiffer and thereby the predicted values of ns mass and @xmath0 are increasing .",
    "therefore , tpma1 and tpmb1 yield the lower bound of @xmath0 for each class of tpm for the quark phase to take place in the core of ns .",
    "next , we consider tpma2 and tpmb2 with @xmath28 .",
    "5 illustrates the hadron - quark phase transition line for tpma1 and tpma2 .",

    "the value of @xmath0 for tpma2 is 2600 mev and the corresponding density is 13@xmath9 .",
    "such a density does not realize in the core of ns and hence the quark phase does not appear in the core of ns for tpma2 .",
    "as for tpmb2 , we find that the hadron - quark phase transition line does not reach the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the reason is that the self interaction @xmath29 of @xmath30 meson more stabilizes the hadron phase with respect to increasing @xmath3 , while the vector - type four - quark interaction suppresses the appearance of quark phase .",
    "in fact , the quark phase is confirmed to never appear in the core of ns for tpmb2 .      finally , we consider tpma3 and tpmb3 . in tpma3 and tpmb3 ,",
