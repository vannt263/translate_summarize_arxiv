    "surprisingly , understanding of melting is still an open problem in condensed matter physics . for instance , after more than hundred years , there is still no reliable theoretical justification of the lindemann criterion @xcite . nevertheless , the melting temperature @xmath0 is well - defined as the temperature at which the gibbs free energy curves of the liquid and solid phase intersect .",
    "graphene , however , is a quasi-2d crystalline membrane @xcite , which melts into a 3d liquid phase @xcite .",
    "the different dimensionality of these two phases makes it impossible to determine their free energy difference with existing methods , so that it is a priori not even clear how to define @xmath0 . here",

    "we show how the formation energy of two 57 pairs rapidly increases with separation .",

    "this two steps scenario via an intermediate quasi-2d liquid phase would imply that the melting temperature of graphene is in fact the temperature at which the 2d solid and the quasi-2d liquid phases are in equilibrium . looking at the snapshot in fig .",
    "[ egamma]a , it can also be argued that before complete melting , when liquid nuclei start to form in the solid sheet , the liquid phase remains connected with the solid sheet at the edges of the nucleus , constraining it to stay within quasi-2d configurations .",
    "the importance of assuming the existence of a quasi-2d liquid phase with its own thermodynamic properties is that it allows us to formulate a nucleation theory for the melting of a 2d solid embedded in 3d space , the case of graphene .",
    "if the melting can only take place via this intermediate , quasi-2d liquid phase , then this intermediate phase is decisive for the location of the melting temperature of graphene .    for the analysis of melting in terms of nucleation theory we performed two series of simulations : simulations at constant temperature and simulations applying a linear temperature ramp .",
    "to assess the accuracy of our approach , we will compare classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) and kinetic nucleation theory ( knt ) , as described hereafter .",

    "<S> we present an approach to the melting of graphene based on nucleation theory for a first order phase transition from the 2d solid to the 3d liquid via an intermediate quasi-2d liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of nucleation theory , supported by the results of systematic atomistic monte carlo simulations , provides an intrinsic definition of the melting temperature of graphene , @xmath0 , and allows us to determine it . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath1 k , about 250 k higher than that of graphite using the same interatomic interaction model . </S>",
    "<S> the found melting temperature is shown to be in good agreement with the asymptotic results of melting simulations for finite disks and ribbons of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> our results strongly suggest that graphene is the most refractory of all known materials . </S>"
