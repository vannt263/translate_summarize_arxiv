    "the structure of complex systems across various disciplines can be abstracted and conceptualized as networks ( or graphs ) of nodes and links to which many quantitative methods can be applied so as to extract any characteristics embedded in the system  @xcite .",
    "numerous complex systems have been expressed in terms of networks , and have often been categorized by the research field , such as social  @xcite , technological  @xcite , and biological networks  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "it was shown that many complex networks had distinctive global features in common , including the small - world  @xcite and the scale - free  @xcite properties .",
    "these uncovered characteristics distinguish complex networks from the random and the regular networks in that the average path between any two nodes is shorter while maintaining highly clustered connections , and that the degree of nodes approximately follows a power law distribution .",
    "in addition to the global characteristics , investigations on complex networks at the local level have been directed to reveal local characteristics from the perspective of finding patterns of interconnections among nodes .",
    "notable examples include the network motif  @xcite , the ( dis)assortativity  @xcite , and the topological modules in the metabolic  @xcite as well as the protein interaction networks  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these characteristics , numerous models for the network growth and evolution have been proposed to understand the underlying mechanism of complex networks .    to gain further understanding of complex networks ,",
    "we investigate local features of the networks from the perspective of the statistical self - similarity .",
    "this may provide us with not only deeper insight into complex networks , but a unified way of describing them . to this end , we focus on the clustering coefficient  @xcite of a node @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is the number of directed links ( an undirected link counts twice ) among @xmath4 nearest neighbor nodes of the node @xmath0 .",
    "it is a measure of the interconnectivity among nearest neighbors of a node , or the modularity  @xcite , thus can be a quantity representing the local structure of the network .    the clustering coefficient has been analyzed from the perspective of the degree correlation .",
    "it was found that the clustering coefficient correlated with the degree in some complex networks . in particular , there is a power law correlation between the clustering coefficient and the degree for the deterministic scale - free network model  @xcite , the internet  @xcite , and metabolic networks  @xcite .",
    "it is a form of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents the average over the same degree , and @xmath7 depends on the type of networks .",
    "however , a similar analysis of the clustering coefficient reveals that the power law correlation is not manifest to other types of networks , such as the protein interaction and social networks .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , the clustering coefficient of the film actor network correlates with the degree not with a power - law , but exponentially ( fig .",
    "1a ) ; while the neural network has an approximate linear correlation between the clustering coefficient and the degree ( fig .",
    "moreover , there is no evident correlation in the protein networks ( fig .  1c , 1d ) .",
    "this finding suggests that in general the clustering coefficient is not a simple quantity which can be related for some common ground to other quantities , such as the degree .",
    "thus , it is desirable to analyze the clustering coefficient beyond the degree correlation . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the systematic analysis of the clustering coefficient in the wide classes of complex networks  @xcite , together with theoretical models for the complex networks , such as the random  @xcite , the scale - free  @xcite , and the small - world networks  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the clustering coefficient in the complex networks of the film actor network , www , the scientific collaboration network , metabolic networks , protein interaction networks , the neural network , and the internet of both autonomous system ( as ) and the router levels ; together with models for the random , the scale - free , and the small - world networks .",
    "for directed networks such as metabolic networks and www , we distinguish the network into the directionality ( in - degree and out - degree ) and carry out separate analysis .",

    "the set of @xmath8 for each network can be used to form a probability distribution ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .  2a-2d ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 in complex networks differ considerably from that of the random network ( fig .",
    "probability distributions for complex networks bring out high irregularity of various intensities in different clustering coefficients , developing a long tail extending to either large ( fig .",
    "2a-2c ) or small ( fig .",
    "2d ) values of the clustering coefficient .",
    "this suggests that not a few but many , possibly infinite , parameters may be needed to characterize the distribution . to quantify the variation in the distribution ,",
    "a continuous spectrum of scaling indices has been proposed  @xcite . for the spectrum that quantifies the inhomogeneity in the probability distribution",
    ", we utilize the clustering coefficient as the probability measure , and analyze the distribution from the perspective of the statistical self - similarity , the multifractal  @xcite .",
    "the multifractal , which is not necessarily related to geometrical properties  @xcite , is a way to describe different self - similar properties for different `` regions '' in an appropriate set ( in our case , different values of the clustering coefficient ) , and applied , for instance , to the fully developed turbulence  @xcite , which is one of the most common examples of complex systems .",
    "it consists of spectra displaying the range of scaling indices and their density in the set , thus has been used to explain richer and more complex scaling behavior of a system than the case in the critical phenomena .",
    "the multifractal can be accomplished by examining the scaling properties of the measure characterized by the singularity strength @xmath9 and its fractal dimension @xmath10 , which roughly indicates how often a particular value of @xmath9 occurs  @xcite . in practice , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are customarily obtained from the legendre transformation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , via @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath12 is the generalized correlation dimension often estimated by the correlation integral method  @xcite .",
    "it is the quantity for anomalous scaling law whose value depends on different moment @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is known as the correlation sum ( or correlation integral ) , and it is given , using heaviside function @xmath17 , as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of nodes and @xmath8 is the clustering coefficient of node @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath12 may be smoothed before transforming into @xmath9 and @xmath10 to avoid the contradiction of the general property of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "there is a difficulty in taking the limit @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) for a finite number of data points . due to the finiteness",
    ", there always exists the minimum distance of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , when @xmath23 is less than the minimum distance , the correlation sum becomes zero and no longer scales with @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in practice , the generalized dimension @xmath12 is determined by plotting @xmath24 as a function of @xmath25 and estimating the slope within an appropriate scaling region using a least square fit . the error associated with the fit",
    "can be obtained as a statistical uncertainty based on fitting a straight line in the scaling region .",
    "3 displays the estimated @xmath10 versus @xmath9 for various complex networks . as shown in fig .",
    "3a-3d , the infinitely many different fractal dimensions , manifested by the shapes of @xmath10 , suggest that the measure is a multifractal , and thus , can not be explained by a single fractal dimension .",
    "all of the complex networks we have examined , except for the neural network of _ caenorhabditis elegans _ , form multifractals irrespective of their global characteristics , such as the number of nodes and their degree distributions .",
    "furthermore , for all complex networks we have analyzed , the average and standard deviation of the most probable singularity strength @xmath26 , where @xmath10 takes its maximum value , are @xmath27 ; those of @xmath28 are @xmath29 .",
    "the multifractal observed in complex networks implies that the distribution of clustering coefficients can be described as interwoven sets of singularities of strength @xmath9 , each of which has its corresponding fractal dimension @xmath10  @xcite . in our case , this implies that different values ( or range of values ) of the clustering coefficient may have different fractal dimensions . from the viewpoint of network dynamics in which rewiring and/or adding new nodes and links are involved , the multifractal suggests that as a network grows , nodes of large clustering coefficients change their clustering coefficients by a factor that differs from nodes of small clustering coefficients change theirs .    the different rate of changing the clustering coefficient may stem from two sources ( or modes ) : the degree of a node @xmath30 and the corresponding interconnectivity @xmath31 . for a fixed @xmath30",
    ", the clustering coefficient depends only on the interconnectivity @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 . in this case , the dynamics ( via rewiring and/or adding new links ) drive networks in such a way that different values of @xmath31 are not equally probable ; rather , some values of @xmath31 are more probable than others .",
    "this assertion is further supported by the fact that as @xmath30 increases , the number of distinct @xmath31 does not increase quadratically in @xmath30 , and that @xmath31 and @xmath30 are linearly correlated ( see below ) . for a fixed @xmath31 , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the addition of new links to higher degree nodes is more likely to drop their clustering coefficient much faster than that of new links to lower degree ones .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of complex networks can be characterized by an evolution via interplay between the two sources .",
    "contrary to most complex networks , the irregularity of the distribution is absent in the neural network of _ caenorhabditis elegans _",
    "the estimate @xmath34 is independent of @xmath11 , resulting in @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the measure is not a multifractal , rather it can be characterized by a single fractal dimension .",
    "the absence of the multifractality is probably due to the biologically intrinsic property of the neuron .",
    "the geometric character of the neuron imposes a constraint on the number of synaptic contacts ( i.e. links ) , leaving no room for the irregularity of the distribution  @xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath10 satisfies @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dimension of the support of the measure , which is the set of clustering coefficients without their relative frequencies .",
    "we find @xmath38 for all complex networks ( fig .",
    "3a-3d ) , indicating that supports of the measure have fractal dimensions , just like the cantor set .",
    "this means that forbidden regions are embedded in the range of allowed clustering coefficients so that some values are highly suppressed .",
    "a possible cause of the suppression might stem from the correlation between the degree @xmath30 of a node and its corresponding interconnectivity @xmath31 .",
    "a simple statistic , such as the pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath39 , ranging @xmath40 , can be used to quantify the correlation , as it reflects to what extent the two quantities are linearly correlated . the result ( fig .",
    "4a ) reveals that complex networks have higher linear correlation than the random network .",
    "moreover , some complex networks , such as metabolic networks and the internet of as level , disclose strong linear correlations ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "for metabolic networks and the internet of as level in which the degree of a node and its interconnectivity among its nearest neighbor nodes are strongly correlated , we ask how the next nearest neighbor nodes are interconnected , and whether the distribution of the corresponding clustering coefficients maintains the multifractality . to this end , we extend the definition of the clustering coefficient to the next nearest nodes by including the next nearest nodes for both the degree of a node @xmath30 and its interconnectivity @xmath31 , which is the number of links between two next nearest nodes .",
    "the irregularity and the long - tail characteristics are again found in the distribution of the extended clustering coefficient , suggesting the existence of the multifractal . as shown in fig .",
    "4b-4d , the probability distribution of the extended version of the measure can again be characterized by the multifractal , indicating that the statistical self - similarity is not necessarily restricted to the local interconnectivity . by including the next nearest neighbor nodes to the definition of the clustering coefficient , more distinct values of the clustering coefficient",
    "are possible than that of the nearest neighbor nodes .",
    "this can be expected since the extended version of the clustering coefficient of a node includes an average over the clustering coefficients of its nearest neighbor nodes , partly smoothing out the irregularity .",
    "this is also manifested by the fact that @xmath42 , the dimension of the support of the extended clustering coefficient , is bigger than corresponding @xmath37 .",
    "based on the multifractal found in complex networks , for comparison , we carried out similar analysis to models of the random , the scale - free , and the small - world networks . in the case of the random network ,",
    "the clustering coefficients are smoothly distributed , by having a `` bell - shape '' ( fig .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 for all @xmath11 , indicating that there is no self - similarity .",
    "this can be expected since the support of the measure can be regarded as a line , which is one dimensional .",
    "the distribution of the clustering coefficient for the scale - free network shows the irregularity , similar to the case of complex networks ; furthermore the distribution can be described by the multifractal ( fig .",
    "3e ) . from simulation results with various different parameters for the network",
    ", however , we found that not only the most probable singularity strength @xmath26 ( @xmath44 ) , but the dimension of the support @xmath37 ( @xmath45 ) is smaller than that of complex networks , suggesting that more severe restriction is imposed on the possible values of the clustering coefficient .",
    "according to the model , nodes of higher degree are preferred to have additional links rather than those of lower degree .",
    "this preferential attachment leaves the clustering coefficient of high degree nodes to decrease much faster than that of low degree ones .",
    "thus when the number of nodes is doubled , for instance , the clustering coefficient of high degree nodes changes by a factor different from that of low degree nodes , analogous to the kinetics of the diffusion - limited aggregation  @xcite .    for the small - world network ,",
    "the rewiring probability @xmath46 dictates both the irregularity in the distribution and the multifractality . for a small rewiring probability ( say , @xmath47 ) , the multifractal emerges ( fig .",
    "3f ) ; however the dimension of the support is @xmath48 , implying that the set of the measure entirely covers the space of the clustering coefficient . as the rewiring probability increases",
    ", the range of the clustering coefficients becomes smaller and the degree of inhomogeneity decreases , and then the network finally becomes a random network as we can easily anticipate .",
    "based on the irregularity of intensities in the probability distribution of the clustering coefficient , we regarded the clustering coefficient as the probability measure and analyzed the clustering coefficient of various types of complex networks from the perspective of the statistical self - similarity .",
    "we found that the probability measure and the support of the measure can be characterized by the multifractal and the fractal , respectively .",
    "furthermore , for complex networks having strong linear correlation between the degree and the interconnectivity , the multifractality extends into the clustering coefficient of the next nearest neighbor nodes .",
    "these characteristics are unique to the real complex networks and can not be found in the random network . from the aspect of the multifractality , models of the scale - free and the small - world differ from real networks in the distribution of the singularity strength @xmath10 .",
    "the statistical self - similarity in the distribution of the clustering coefficient can be served as a general characteristic of complex networks ; at the same time , giving a further insight into the understanding of complex networks .",
    "the multifractality shared by different complex networks suggests that a similar law may govern the diverse complex networks of nature as well as artificiality .",
    "furthermore , it can be used to classify the complex networks , and serves as a `` touchstone '' of proposed models for complex networks .",
