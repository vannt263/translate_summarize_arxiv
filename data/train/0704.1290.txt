    "over the past years , there have been a number of lines of investigation for describing qcd - like theories with gravity duals . in this way ,",
    "considerable progress towards a gauge / gravity dual description of phenomenologically relevant models has been made .",
    "one of these lines of investigation is the gravity dual description of the quark - gluon plasma obtained by applying ads / cft to relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the central result of this approach is the calculation of the shear viscosity from ads / cft .",
    "more recently , an r charge chemical potential has been introduced by considering gravity backgrounds with r charged black holes @xcite , and also the heat conductivity has been calculated by considering the r current correlators in these backgrounds @xcite .    a further approach",
    "to generalizing the ads / cft correspondence to more realistic field theories is the addition of flavor to gravity duals via the addition of probe branes @xcite .",
    "this allows in particular for the calculation of meson masses .",
    "these two approaches have been combined in order to study the flavor contribution to finite temperature field theories from the gravity dual perspective .",
    "this began with @xcite where the embedding of a d7-brane probe into the ads - schwarzschild black hole background was studied and a novel phase transition was found , which occurs when the d7 probe reaches the black hole horizon .",
    "this transition was shown to be of first order in @xcite ( see @xcite for a similar transition in the d4/d6 system ) , and studied in further detail in @xcite .",
    "related phase transitions appear in @xcite .",
    "mesons in gravity duals of finite temperature field theories have been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , in view of adding flavor to the quark - gluon plasma , the flavor contribution to the shear viscosity has been calculated in @xcite , where it was found that @xmath1 .    for a thermodynamical approach in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the inclusion of a chemical potential and a finite number density is essential . in @xcite ,",
    "an isospin chemical potential was introduced by considering two coincident d7 probes , and by giving a vev to the time component of the @xmath0 gauge field on this probe .",
    "this was shown to give rise to a thermodynamical instability comparable to bose - einstein condensation , compatible with the field - theoretical results of @xcite .",
    "for the gauge / gravity dual analysis , a potential generated by an @xmath0 instanton on the d7 probe in the gravity background was used @xcite .",
    "a baryon chemical potential @xmath2 is obtained by turning on the diagonal @xmath3 gauge field on the d7-brane probe @xcite .",
    "contributions to the d7-brane action arise from the derivative of this @xmath4 gauge field with respect to the radial direction .",
    "the effects of this potential on the first - order phase transition described above have been studied in @xcite , where regions of thermodynamical instability have been found in the @xmath5 phase diagram .",
    " for the @xmath6 sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , the phase transitions in presence of a baryon number chemical potential , as well as physical processes such as photoemission and vector meson screening , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "a related approach has been used to calculate the rate of energy loss of a heavy quark moving through a supersymmetric yang - mills plasma at large coupling @xcite . in this approach",
    "the heavy quark is given by a classical string attached to the d7-brane probe .",
    " a first study of flavors in thermal ads / cft beyond the quenched approximation , i.e. with  @xmath7 , was performed in  @xcite .    here",
    "we study finite - temperature field theories with finite isospin chemical potential by considering two coincident d7-brane probes in the lorentzian signature ads - schwarzschild black hole background . as in @xcite",
    ", we introduce an isospin chemical potential by defining @xmath8 for the time component of the @xmath0 gauge field on the two coincident d7-branes . this constant chemical potential is a solution to the d7-brane equations of motion and is present even for the d7-brane embedding corresponding to massless quarks .",
    "we consider small @xmath9 , such that the bose - einstein instability mentioned above , which is of order @xmath10 , does not affect our discussion here .    for simplicity",
    "we consider only the d7 probe embedding for which the quark mass vanishes , @xmath11 .",
    "this embedding is constant and terminates at the horizon .",
    "we establish the @xmath0 non - abelian action for a probe of two coincident d7-branes .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion for fluctuations about the background given by ( [ eq : backg ] ) .",
    "these are dual to the @xmath0 flavor current @xmath12 .",
    "we find an ansatz for decoupling the equations of motion for the different lorentz and flavor components , and solve them by adapting the method developed in @xcite .",
    "this involves fourier transforming to momentum space , and using a power expansion ansatz for the equations of motion .",
    "we discuss the approximation necessary for an analytical solution , which amounts to considering frequencies with @xmath13 . with this approach",
    "we obtain the complete current - current correlator .",
    "the key point is that the constant chemical potential effectively replaces a time derivative in the action and in the equations of motion . in the fourier transformed picture",
    ", this leads to a square - root dependence of physical observables on the frequency , @xmath14 .",
    "this non - linear behavior goes beyond linear response theory .",
    "we discuss the physical properties of the green functions contributing to the current - current correlator .",
    "in particular , for small frequencies we find a frequency - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath15 . whereas frequency - dependent diffusion has  to our knowledge  not yet been discussed in the context of the quark - gluon plasma , it is well - known in the theory of quantum liquids .",
    "for instance , for small frequencies the square - root behavior we find agrees qualitatively with the results of @xcite for liquid para - hydrogen .",
    "generally , frequency - dependent diffusion leads to a non - exponential decay of time - dependent fluctuations , as discussed for a classical fluid in @xcite .",
    "physically , the isospin chemical potential corresponds to the energy necessary to inverting the isospin of a given particle . within nuclear physics ,",
    "such a chemical potential is of relevance for the description neutron stars .",
    "moreover , isospin diffusion has been measured in heavy ion reactions  @xcite .",
    " for two - flavor qcd , effects of a finite isospin chemical potential have been discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams discussed there are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we expect to return to similar diagrams in the gauge / gravity dual context in the future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the ads / cft hydrodynamics approach to calculating green functions , which we use in the subsequent .",
    "moreover we comment on frequency - dependent diffusion within hydrodynamics . in section 3",
    "we establish the d7 probe action in presence of the isospin chemical potential , derive the corresponding equations of motion and solve them . in section 4",
    "we obtain the associated green functions in the hydrodynamical approximation .",
    "we discuss their pole structure and obtain the frequency - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with an interpretation of our results .",
    "an explanation of our notation as well as a series of calculations are relegated to a number of appendices .",
    "thermal green functions have proven to be a useful tool for analyzing the structure of hydrodynamic theories and for calculating hydrodynamic quantities such as transport coefficients .",
    "for instance , given a retarded current correlation function  @xmath16 in minkowski space , the spectral function can be written in terms of its imaginary part , @xmath17 for the gravity dual approach , this is discussed for instance in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the gauge / gravity dual prescription of @xcite for calculating green functions in minkowski spacetime . for further reference",
    ", we outline this prescription in the subsequent .",
    "it is based on the ads / cft - correspondence relating supergravity fields  @xmath18 in a black hole background to operators  @xmath19 in the dual gauge theory .",
    "the black hole background is asymptotically anti - de sitter space and places the dual field theory at finite temperature .",
    "this temperature corresponds to the hawking temperature of the black hole , or more generally speaking , of the black branes . starting out from a classical supergravity action  @xmath20 for the gauge field",
    "@xmath18 , according to @xcite we extract the function  @xmath21  ( containing metric factors and the metric determinant ) in front of the kinetic term  @xmath22 , @xmath23 then we perform a fourier transformation and solve the linearized equations of motion in momentum space .",
    "this is a second order differential equation , so we have to fix two boundary conditions .",
    "the first one at the boundary of ads at  @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 where  @xmath26 is the value of the supergravity field at the boundary of ads depending only on the four flat boundary coordinates .",
    "thus by definition we have  @xmath27 . for the other boundary , located at the horizon  @xmath28",
    ", we impose the incoming wave condition .",
    "this requires that any fourier mode  @xmath29 with timelike  @xmath30 can travel into the black hole , but is not allowed to cross the horizon in the opposite direction . for spacelike @xmath30 , the components of @xmath18 have to be regular at the horizon",
    ". then the retarded thermal green function is given by @xmath31    the thermal correlators obtained in this way display hydrodynamic properties , such as poles located at complex frequencies .",
    "generically , for the r current component correlation functions calculated from supergravity , there are retarded contributions of the form @xmath32 this may be identified with the the green function for the hydrodynamic diffusion equation @xmath33 with @xmath34 the time component of a diffusive current .",
    "@xmath35 is the diffusion constant . in fourier space",
    "this equation reads @xmath36 in position space , this corresponds to an exponential decay of @xmath34 with time .    for the non - abelian case with an isospin chemical potential , in sections [ sec : sugrabackandaction ] and [ sec : heatanddiff ] we will obtain retarded green functions of the form @xmath37 retarded green functions of this type",
    "have been discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : omegadiff ] ) corresponds to frequency - dependent diffusion with coefficient @xmath38 , such that ( [ eq : constantd ] ) becomes @xmath39 in our case , @xmath34 is the averaged isospin at a given point in the liquid .",
    "this is a non - linear behavior which goes beyond linear response theory . in particular ,",
    "when fourier - transforming back to position space , we have to use the convolution for the product @xmath40 and obtain @xmath41 for the redarded green function .",
    "this implies together with the continuity equation @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the three - vector current associated to @xmath34 , that @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the convolution .",
    "this replaces the linear response theory constitutive equation @xmath46 .",
    "note that for @xmath47 with @xmath35 constant , ( [ eq : convolution ] ) reduces again to ( [ eq : diffusionequation ] ) .",
    "we consider an asymptotically @xmath48 spacetime as the near horizon limit of a stack of @xmath49 coincident d3-branes . more precisely , as in @xcite ,",
    "our background is an @xmath50 black hole , which is the geometry dual to a field theory at finite temperature .",
    "the minkowski signature background is @xmath51 with the metric @xmath52 of the unit @xmath53-sphere , and the function @xmath54 , @xmath50 radius @xmath55 and temperature parameter @xmath56 given in terms of the string coupling @xmath57 , temperature @xmath58 , inverse string tension @xmath59 and number of colors @xmath49 by @xmath60 the geometry is asymptotically @xmath48 with the boundary of the @xmath50 part located at @xmath24 . at the black hole horizon",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath61 has the value @xmath28 .    into this ten - dimensional spacetime",
    "we embed @xmath62 coinciding d7-branes , hosting flavor gauge fields @xmath63 .",
    "the embedding we choose extends the d7-branes in all directions of @xmath50 space and wraps an @xmath64 on the @xmath65 . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the most straightforward case , that is the embedding of the branes through the origin along the @xmath50 radial coordinate @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to massless quarks in the dual field theory . on the brane",
    ", the metric in this case simply reduces to @xmath66 due the choice of our gauge field in the next subsection , the remaining three - sphere in this metric will not play a prominent role .",
    "the table below gives an overview of the indices we use to refer to certain directions and subspaces .",
    "a gravity dual description of a chemical potential amounts to a non - dynamical time component of the gauge field @xmath63 in the action for the d7-brane probe embedded into the background given above .",
    "there are essentially two different ways to realize a non - vanishing contribution from a chemical potential to the field strength tensor @xmath67}+f^{abc}a^b_\\mu a^c_\\nu$ ] .",
    "the first is to consider a @xmath61-dependent baryon chemical potential for a single brane probe .",
    "the second , which we pursue here , is to consider a constant isospin chemical potential .",
    "this requires a non - abelian probe brane action and thus a probe of at least two coincident d7-branes , as suggested in @xcite . here",
    "the time component of the gauge field is taken to be @xmath68 where we sum over indices which occur twice in a term and denote the gauge group generators by @xmath69 .",
    "the brane configuration described above corresponds to an @xmath70 gauge group with @xmath62 on the brane , which corresponds to a global @xmath70 in the dual field theory . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the generators of the gauge group on the brane are given by @xmath71 , with pauli matrices @xmath72 .",
    "we will see that ( [ eq : nonabelianmu ] ) indeed produces non - trivial new contributions to the action .    using the standard background field method of quantum field theory , we will consider the chemical potential as a fixed background and let the gauge fields fluctuate .",
    "we single out a particular direction in flavor space by taking @xmath73 as the only non - vanishing component of the background field . from now on we use the symbol @xmath74 to refer to gauge field fluctuations around the fixed background , @xmath75    we pick the gauge in which @xmath76 and assume that @xmath77 for @xmath78 . due to the symmetries of the background , we effectively examine gauge field fluctuations @xmath63 living in the five - dimensional subspace on the brane spanned by the coordinates @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and by the radial ads coordinate @xmath61 .",
    "the magnitude of all components of @xmath18 and the background chemical potential @xmath9 are considered to be small .",
    "this allows us to simplify certain expressions by dropping terms of higher order in @xmath18 and in the chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "the action describing the dynamics of the flavor gauge fields in the setup of this work is the dirac - born - infeld action .",
    "there are no contributions from the chern - simons action , which would require non - zero gauge field components in all of the 4,5,6,7-directions .",
    "as mentioned , we consider the d7 probe embedding whose asymptotic value at the boundary is chosen such that it corresponds to vanishing quark mass , @xmath11 .",
    "the metric on the brane is then given by ( [ eq : finitetmetric ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in two - point correlators only , it is sufficient to consider the action to second order in @xmath59 , @xmath83 where we use the following definitions for the d7-brane tension @xmath84 and the trace over the representation matrices @xmath69 , @xmath85 in our case we have @xmath86 .",
    "the overall factor @xmath87 comes from the integration over the @xmath88-directions , which are the directions along the @xmath64 .    evaluating the dbi action given in  ( [ eq : dbiaction ] ) with the substitution rule  ( [ eq : backgroundrule ] ) , we arrive at @xmath89}\\ ,    \\partial_{[\\mu'}^{\\vphantom{a } } a^a_{\\nu ' ] }   -    8 \\delta_{0\\nu } \\delta_{0\\nu ' } f^{abc } \\partial_{[0}^{\\vphantom{a } } a^a_{\\mu]}\\ ,    a^b_{\\mu'}\\ , \\mu^c   \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the short - hand notation @xmath90 and neglect terms of higher than linear order in @xmath9 , and higher than quadratic order in @xmath18 since both are small in our approach .    up to the sum over flavor indices @xmath91 , the first term in the bracket in ( [ eq : dbiactionwithmu ] ) is reminiscent of the abelian super - maxwell action in five dimensions , considered already for the r charge current correlators in  @xcite .",

    "we proceed by calculating the retarded green functions for the action ( [ eq : dbiactionwithmu ] ) , following the prescription of @xcite as outlined in section 2 above . according to this prescription , as a first step we consider the equations of motion obtained from the action  ( [ eq : dbiactionwithmu ] ) , which are given by @xmath94 }    \\right )   \\\\    & + f^{abc}\\left [ \\sqrt{-g } g^{00 } g^{\\nu\\nu'}\\:\\mu^c     \\left(\\partial^{\\vphantom{b}}_{\\nu ' } a_{0}^b-2\\partial^{\\vphantom{b}}_0",

    "we choose the momentum of the fluctuations to be along the @xmath82 direction , so their momentum four - vector is @xmath100 . with this choice",
    "we have specified to gauge fields which only depend on the radial coordinate @xmath61 , the time coordinate @xmath79 and the spatial @xmath82 direction .",
