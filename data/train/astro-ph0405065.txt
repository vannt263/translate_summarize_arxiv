    "concerning the @xmath0 process , xenon belongs to the six elements with a pair of @xmath0-only isotopes . in this case , the relevant nuclei are @xmath1xe and @xmath3xe , both shielded against the @xmath8-process region by their stable te isobars .",
    "the abundances of these isotopes define the strength of the branching in the @xmath0-process reaction chain illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . since the @xmath5-process contribution to the observed abundances in this mass region",
    "can typically be neglected , such shielded nuclei are commonly considered to be of pure @xmath0 origin . in the case of xe , however , it was pointed out that @xmath1xe is not a typical @xmath0-only nucleus , since its solar abundance may include a significant @xmath5 contribution @xcite . on the neutron - rich side , @xmath9xe and @xmath10xe are considered as @xmath8-only nuclei , since the @xmath11 half life of @xmath12xe is short enough to prevent any significant @xmath0-process production .",
    "this paper aims at a thorough discussion of the @xmath0-process aspects by using accurate stellar ( @xmath2 ) cross sections of the relevant te and xe isotopes @xcite . following a summary of the various sources of isotopic xe abundance patterns ( @xmath13[facts ] ) , the particular features of the @xmath0-process branchings at @xmath14 are discussed in @xmath13[sprocess ] .",
    "the @xmath0-process aspects related to thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are described in @xmath13[models ] , and the results are presented in @xmath13[results ] .",
    "when stellar ( @xmath2 ) cross sections for @xmath15xe with relative uncertainties of less then 2% became available @xcite , the determination of the elemental solar xenon abundance was a first natural application .",
    "while it is impossible to use standard methods for noble gases , i.e. meteorite analyses or solar spectroscopy , the solar xe abundance of 5.30 @xmath4 0.14 relative to si=10@xmath16 could be derived from @xmath0-process systematics .",
    "apart from the solar abundance , these cross sections provide the key for the interpretation of the xenon isotope patterns , which bear promising clues for the analysis of presolar grains .",
    "the noble gas nature of xenon implies that there are no stable chemical compounds .",
    "accordingly , the isotopic ratios of xenon in planetary bodies were subject to mass fractionation effects during the earliest stages of the solar system .",
    "terrestrial ratios are additionally affected by fission of u and th , which are both enriched compared to the solar average @xcite .",
    "so far the most representative ratio for the solar system , @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe = 0.510@xmath40.005 , has been obtained from the solar wind component implanted in lunar rocks ( pepin et al .",
    "1995 ; u. ott , private communication ) . in the near future ,",
    "more data are to be expected from the genesis mission @xcite .",
    "the discovery that presolar grains are carriers of noble gases with isotopic compositions significantly different from solar material ( ott 1993 ; zinner 1998 , and references therein ) opened a new window to stellar and galactic evolution .",
    "these grains , which originate from circumstellar envelopes of agb stars or supernova outflows by condensation of the most stable compounds , such as silicon carbide ( sic ) and diamond ( c ) , acted as carriers of trace elements like noble gases .",
    "accordingly , their isotopic composition contains a wealth of information on the nucleosynthesis at the site of their origin . among the many identified elements in these grains , the isotope patterns of the noble gases are particularly prominent .",
    "two characteristic components were isolated for xenon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table [ tab1 ] ) :    - xenon - s @xcite was found to be carried by presolar mainstream sic grains ( lewis et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) , exhibits a pronounced zig - zag abundance pattern , reflecting the inverse of the respective stellar ( @xmath2 ) cross sections .",
    "this is characteristic for an @xmath0-process origin and points to agb stars as the production site .",
    "- xenon - hl , which was identified in presolar diamond grains ( huss & lewis 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "it exhibits enhanced abundances of the light and heavy isotopes and is most likely produced in supernova explosions , which are commonly believed to produce @xmath8- and @xmath5-enriched material .",
    "nucleosynthesis models are challenged by these observations , because the information contained in this material witnesses the original on - site production .",
    "as far as the @xmath0-process component is concerned , the challenge is directly linked to the reliability of the stellar neutron capture cross sections .",
    "the case of xenon is appealing , since the abundance ratio of the @xmath0-only nuclei @xmath1xe and @xmath3xe reflects the strength of the @xmath17te and @xmath1i branchings as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the presently available information on the @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratio for xe - s ( table [ tab1 ] ) can not be explained by the schematic classical approach of the @xmath0 process , which unavoidably overestimates this ratio at the characteristic temperature derived from the analysis of other branchings .",
    "more specific stellar evolutionary models have been invoked , using the xe abundance patterns as a crucial model test .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the branchings at @xmath17te and @xmath1i are expected to be comparably weak since only a small part of the total @xmath0-process flow is bypassing @xmath1xe . therefore , the product of the stellar ( n,@xmath18 ) cross section and the respective @xmath0 abundance , which characterizes the reaction flow , is slightly smaller for @xmath1xe than for @xmath3xe . since their solar isotopic abundance ratio @xcite as well as the stellar cross section ratio are accurately known , the @xmath19 ratio , and hence the strength of the branching , can be determined .",
    "the branching at @xmath17te is weak , because the population of ground state and isomer is quickly thermalized in the hot stellar photon bath , leading to a strong dominance of the @xmath20-decay channel of the fast ground state decay .",
    "the neutron capture cross section of @xmath17te is only theoretically known and may be uncertain by a factor of two .",
    "this branching plays an almost negligible role for the final @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratio as we shall discuss later .",
    "the second branching at @xmath1i with an half - life of only 25  min is exceptional , since it originates from the competition between the short - lived @xmath11 and electron capture ( ec ) decays only .",
    "in contrast to other branchings , the influence of the stellar neutron flux is negligible in this case , thus eliminating an important uncertainty in the @xmath0-process calculation of the isotopic xe abundances .",
    "this provides a unique possibility to better constrain temperature and electron density of the stellar plasma , which are manifested via the ec rate of @xmath1i @xcite .",
    "the branching factor at @xmath1i is @xmath21 the @xmath11-decay rate varies only weakly with stellar temperature , but the electron capture rate depends strongly on temperature due to the increasing degree of ionisation .",
    "furthermore , at high temperatures , when the ions are fully stripped , the ec rate becomes sensitive to the density in the stellar plasma due to electron capture from the continuum .",
    "according to takahashi & yokoi ( 1987 ) , the ec rate decreases by one order of magnitude at @xmath22 k and @xmath23 g@xmath24 with respect to the terrestrial value . applying the simple expression for the branching strength",
    ", it appears that the branchings are working only at low temperatures ( table  [ tab2 ] ) , at least in the straightforward constant - temperature concept of the classical model . since",
    "a thermal energy of @xmath25 kev has instead been estimated by that approach @xcite , it is obvious that the classical model fails in describing the @xmath1i branching . indeed , using the new @xmath1xe and @xmath3xe cross sections , a fixed temperature of @xmath26 kev and a fixed matter density of 1.3@xmath2710@xmath28 g/@xmath29 , one obtains an abundance ratio of ( @xmath1xe/@xmath1xe)@xmath30 = 0.51@xmath40.02 , as reported in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "this ratio matches the solar ratio , but not the xe - s ratio of 0.447@xmath40.003 measured in mainstream presolar grains .",
    "this problem can not be solved , even if one assumes a factor of two for uncertainty of the ec rate of @xmath1i , because this does not change the branching factor by more than 3% .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that in a recent investigation of the uncertainties of the decay rates calculated by @xcite , the uncertainties of the stellar beta - decay rates of @xmath1i were estimated to be only @xmath410% @xcite .",
    "consequently , it needs to be checked , how this problem can be treated by the more comprehensive stellar @xmath0-process models .",
    "current stellar models for describing the main @xmath0-process component in the mass range @xmath31 90 refer to helium shell burning in thermally pulsing low mass agb stars @xcite .",
    "this scenario is characterized by the subsequent operation of two neutron sources during a series of helium shell flashes .",
    "first , the @xmath32c(@xmath33 , n)@xmath34o reaction occurs under radiative conditions during the intervals between convective he - shell burning episodes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32c reaction , which operates at low temperatures ( @xmath35 8 kev ) and neutron densities ( @xmath36 @xmath24 ) , provides most of the neutron exposure .",
    "the rate of the @xmath32c reaction has been adopted from denker et al .",
    "however , the resulting abundances are modified by a second burst of neutrons from the @xmath37ne(@xmath33 , n)@xmath38 mg reaction , which is marginally activated during the next convective instability , when higher temperatures ( @xmath35 23 kev ) are reached in the bottom layers of the convective pulse , leading to peak neutron densities of @xmath39 @xmath24 @xcite . the rate of the @xmath37ne reaction , which determines the strength of this neutron source , has been adopted from the evaluation of kppeler et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , excluding the contribution by the resonance at 633 kev and using the lower limit for the width of the resonance at 828 kev .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows a schematic representation of the sequence of he - shell flashes and the alternating interpulse periods .",
    "the @xmath32c is produced via the reaction sequence @xmath40c(p , @xmath18)@xmath32n(@xmath41c , when a small amount of protons is diffusing from the envelope into the top layers of the he- and @xmath40c - rich zone , forming the so - called @xmath32c pocket .",
    "this proton diffusion is supposedly driven by the occurrence of the third dredge - up episode , when h burning is temporarily inactive and the convective envelope penetrates into the upper region of the he intershell .",
    "although the second burst accounts only for a few percent of the total neutron exposure , it determines the final abundance patterns of the @xmath0-process branchings .",
    "this makes the branchings a sensitive test for the interplay of the two neutron sources as well as for the time dependence of neutron density and temperature during the second neutron burst . in this context , it is important to note that the ( @xmath2 ) cross sections in the te - i - xe region are large enough that the typical neutron capture times are significantly shorter than the duration of the neutron exposure during the he shell flash .",
    "as far as the isotopic abundance pattern of xenon is concerned , the current set of agb models , covering a range of stellar masses ( 1.5 @xmath42 3 ) and metallicities ( @xmath43 [ fe / h ] @xmath44 0 ) , was found to yield surprisingly consistent results . changing the amount of @xmath32c , and hence the integrated neutron flux as well as the ( @xmath33,n ) rates of @xmath32c and @xmath37ne by a factor of two ,",
    "affected the @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios by less than 1.5% .",
    "this is remarkable , since the @xmath32c pocket determines the actual efficiency for neutron capture nucleosynthesis , whereas the @xmath37ne rate governs the neutron density during he flashes .",
    "the effects due to variations of the most sensitive nuclear and stellar quantities are summarized in tables [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] .    in view of the robustness of the @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios with respect to the parameterization of the models used",
    ", the current calculations of agb nucleosynthesis were based on the standard assumptions , which have been shown to match the solar main @xmath0-process component @xcite , i.e. using the average of models for 1.5 @xmath45 and 3 @xmath45 , a metallicity of 0.5 @xmath46 , and the standard @xmath32c pocket @xcite . keeping the standard parameters unchanged , the resulting xenon abundances allowed us to study the effect of the time scales .",
    "preliminary studies of the convective zone , generated by he shell flashes , reported turnover times of a few hours @xcite . in this work ,",
    "extensive calculations were carried out in order to study the possible effect on the branchings at @xmath17te and @xmath1i more detailed .",
    "the evolution of the internal structure of agb stars was calculated for an initial mass range between 1 and 3 @xmath47 .",
    "convective velocities are evaluated by means of the mixing length theory .",
    "the numerical algorithms and the input physics of the _ franec _ code used in this work have been extensively presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the results for a typical thermal pulse of a 3 @xmath45 agb star of solar composition are summarized in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the temperature in the convective shell ( top ) is shown as a function of the mass coordinate for two different times ( 27 days before and 23 days after the maximum of the thermal pulse , respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding calculated convective velocities are plotted in the panels below , showing the dependence on the mass coordinate ( middle ) and on the internal radius ( bottom ) .",
    "the scale on the abscissa starts at the bottom of the convective shell .",
    "a comparison of the latter plots shows how the convective shell expands after the pulse maximum , while remaining almost constant in mass .",
    "the convective turnover time is only @xmath481  hour .",
    "this picture changes with core mass : the larger the core mass the higher are both , the peak of the bottom temperature and the peak of the convective velocity .",
    "the core mass of about 0.62 @xmath45 of the model shown in fig.[fig4 ] is typical for a low mass agb star .",
    "in fact , during the agb phase the core mass increases from about 0.56 to 0.66 for initial stellar masses ranging from 1.5 to 3 @xmath45 .",
    "thus , temperatures as well as convective velocities of the intershell are increasing during the evolution along the agb . with increasing stellar masses ,",
    "the core mass at the beginning of the agb phase becomes larger , resulting in a corresponding increase of temperatures and convective velocities .",
    "convective velocities are averages , which depend on the degree of super - adiabacity and on the adopted mixing length . since convection is very efficient in stellar interiors , the degree of super - adiabacity is very small , leaving the mixing length as the main source of uncertainty . as usual",
    ", the mixing length parameter was calibrated by fitting the solar radius .",
    "the mixing length may realistically range between one and two pressure scale heights .",
    "accordingly , the convective velocities may vary within a factor of two , because they depend linearly on the mixing length .",
    "the short convective turnover time ensures that @xmath1i is efficiently removed from the hot reaction zone in spite of its 25  min half - life . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] one can infer that freshly produced material leaves the bottom zone within only 50 to 200  s. accordingly , @xmath1i decays predominantly at lower temperatures , thus favoring the ec branch towards @xmath1te , which yields correspondingly smaller @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios .",
    "the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis calculation has been performed using a post - processing technique that carefully follows the stellar evolutionary structure up to the tip of the agb ( for details , see section 2 of gallino et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the results of the branching analyses are summarized in table [ tab5 ] , which lists the calculated isotopic ratios for the @xmath0-only nuclei @xmath1xe and @xmath3xe . the respective uncertainties are essentially determined by the 1.5% uncertainty of the cross section ratio @xmath49(@xmath1xe)/@xmath49(@xmath3xe ) itself @xcite as well as by the small uncertainties of the stellar branching ratio of @xmath1i discussed below .    while the first line of table [ tab5 ] illustrates the argument that the high temperature imposed by the classical model is not compatible with the @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios in xe - s , the last lines refer to the stellar model results , which show a more promising behavior .",
    "since the decay of @xmath1i is dominated by the @xmath11-mode , the results are insensitive to the stellar ec rate : variations by a factor of two affect the branching ratio by less than 3% .",
    "this shows the robustness of the stellar model against changes in the stellar environment , resulting in an overall uncertainty of less than 3% .",
    "a first hint that convection in the he shell has a noticeable effect on the branching was observed by comparing the @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios obtained with the _ netz _ code @xcite , which follows the @xmath0-process network with the neutron density and temperature profiles from the full agb model , but neglects the effect of convection .",
    "these results yield @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios that are systematically higher than calculated with the full agb model .    in the full model ,",
    "the effect of convection on the abundance evolution was studied by reducing the time steps from the usually adopted 10@xmath16  s to 10@xmath50  s and eventually to 3@xmath2710@xmath51  s ( or 8  h ) . though this led to a small effect on the @xmath1te production via the branching at @xmath17te , the net effect on",
    "the final @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratio is negligible due to the rearrangement of the abundance pattern during freeze - out , when the neutron density is decreasing at the end of the pulse .    the change in the production factors during typical shell flashes @xmath52 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] together with the time dependence of the average neutron density in the convective zone .",
    "the production factors are plotted relative to the @xmath3xe abundance at the end of the shell flash and are normalized to the solar values .",
    "obviously , the increase of temperature at the bottom of the convective shell with stellar mass and with pulse number is reflected by an increasing peak neutron density released by the @xmath37ne(@xmath53)@xmath38 mg reaction .",
    "the variations found in fig .  [ fig5 ] confirm the more complex situation sketched in @xmath134.2 than one might expect from the trends of the branching factor given in table [ tab2 ] . during the low temperature phase between he shell flashes , the neutron density produced via the @xmath32c(@xmath33",
    ", n)@xmath34o reaction is less than 10@xmath54 @xmath24 .",
    "the neutron capture branch at @xmath17te being completely closed results in a @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe abundance ratio of 0.94 relative to the solar values at the end of the low temperature phase due to the effect of the @xmath1i branching .",
    "after the onset of convection and mixing with material from previous flashes at the beginning of the he shell flash , one finds the 8% difference between @xmath1xe and @xmath3xe , which is then modified as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    during the following shell flash ,",
    "the branching remains open in spite of the higher temperatures of this phase .",
    "there are three essential effects , which concur to explain this behavior :    * during the peak of temperature and neutron density , the electron densities at the bottom of the convective he shell flash , i.e. in the @xmath0-process zone , are between 15 @xmath27 10@xmath55 @xmath24 and 20 @xmath27 10@xmath55 @xmath24 . according to table [ tab2 ] ,",
    "the branching at @xmath1i is never completely closed . even at the peak temperatures of the he - shell flash ,",
    "typically 3% of the flow are bypassing @xmath1xe . *",
    "the quick transport of @xmath1i from the production zone to cooler layers implies that the ec decay branch remains significant .",
    "this causes more of the reaction flow to bypass @xmath1xe and leads to smaller @xmath1xe/@xmath3xe ratios .",
    "* around the maximum of the neutron density , the branching at @xmath17te is no longer negligible .",
    "instead , it leads to a significant effect on the @xmath1xe abundance , which is more pronounced for the 25th pulse of the 3 @xmath45 model shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "correspondingly , this branching is responsible for an @xmath0-process contribution of about 3% to the abundance of @xmath1te , which is considered as an @xmath8-only isotope .    after averaging over the agb evolution of the two stellar models for 1.5 and 3 @xmath45 with a metallicity of 0.5@xmath46 , as described by arlandini et al .",
