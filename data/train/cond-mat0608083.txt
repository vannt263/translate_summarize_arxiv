    "exotic behaviors include either the realization of a spin - liquid ground state or a magnetically ordered phase with a magnetic excitation dispersion strongly renormalized compared to the classical spin - wave .",

    "the effect of frustration is to bring about the effect of competing ground states , it is expected that the spin excitations out of a semi - classical long - range ordered ground state are direct tell - tale indicators of the presence of frustrating interactions . in this paper",

    "motivated by the successes of exact - diagonalization to identify the essential qualitative features of the raman spectrum on the square lattice @xcite , and in order to compare with these well - known results , we explore in this study the behaviour of a 16-site cluster as the frustrating @xmath19 coupling is increased from zero .",

    "[ hamiltheis ] , it is obvious that the ground state will depend on the ratio @xmath4 , ranging from a nel - like order on the square lattice when @xmath5 , to a three sublattice long - range order for @xmath60 @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed , using series expansions , that the magnon dispersion for the anisotropic triangular lattice heisenberg model exhibits a _",
    "roton - like _ minimum .",
    "this local minimum sits at the @xmath61 point for a square lattice with one diagonal bond and is getting softer as the @xmath19-diagonal frustrating coupling increases . in the case of the standard square lattice , for the b@xmath53 channel with crossed polarizations , the electromagnetic field couples to excitations along the @xmath61 direction .",
    "we note from @xcite that this softening is a multi - magnon process that can not be captured to lowest order in a 1/s expansion .",
    "however , since we are using exact - diagonalization which , by its nature , treats processes for the length scale considered exactly , we are able to detect indications of this softening . for specificity , consider the b@xmath53 channel in the top left - hand panel of fig .",
    "a signature of the softening of the magnon excitation is clearly manifest as the frustration ratio @xmath62 is increased from zero , with a shift of the spectral weight , and the main peak moving from @xmath63 when @xmath5 to @xmath64 when @xmath65 .",
    "the results presented here show how frustration can dramatically alter the raman spectrum of an otherwise non - frustrated system .",
    "in particular , we observe a frustration - driven _ spectral downshift _ , the landmark feature of frustrated systems .",
