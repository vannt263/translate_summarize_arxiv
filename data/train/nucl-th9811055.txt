    "parity violating ( pv ) electron scattering can provide very interesting information on the electroweak ( ewk ) structure of the nucleon , as first suggested in ref.@xcite , complementary to those given by neutrino scattering and by pv atomic experiments .",
    "only three of the four form factors determining the proton weak neutral currents ( excluding second class currents ) can be probed by the pv electron scattering .",
    "in fact , the induced pseudoscalar component of the axial - vector current does not contribute to pv electron scattering to leading order in ewk coupling .",
    "in particular it could shed light on the possible strange quark contributions to the nucleon properties . such a contribution",
    "is strongly suggested by the analysis of the pion - nucleon sigma term @xcite , of the cross section of the elastic neutrino / antineutrino - proton scattering @xcite , and of the spin - dependent structure functions of the nucleon in deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "a first measurement of the pv beam asymmetry in @xmath1 elastic scattering was performed at bates / mit laboratory by the sample collaboration giving the first experimental determination of the weak magnetic form factor of the proton at q@xmath2= 0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 @xcite . from this value",
    "the strangeness magnetic form factor is obtained by subtracting out the neutron and proton magnetic form factors as g@xmath3(0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 ) = 0.23 @xmath4 0.37 @xmath4 0.15 @xmath4 0.19 @xmath5 , where the three uncertainties are statistical , systematic and theoretical , respectively .",
    "this result suggests a positive value of the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath6 = g@xmath3(0 ) , even if a vanishing or a negative value can not be excluded .",
    "this is at variance with the large majority of the theoretical predictions and could lead to rather bizarre properties of qcd @xcite .    a second measurement of the pv beam asymmetry at @xmath7=0.48 ( gev / c)@xmath2 has been made very recently by the happex collaboration @xcite   at the thomas jefferson laboratory . unlike the sample collaboration , they have chosen to detect the scattered electrons at forward angles so as to provide information on the strange contribution to the weak electric form factor @xmath8 . the measured asymmetry ( @xmath9 = - 14.5 @xmath4 2.2 ppm ) turns out to be explained by the ewk standard model without contributions from the strange quark .",
    "because of the difficulties inherent in the pv electron scattering experiment an independent determination of @xmath6 , as well as of the other strangeness properties of the proton ( mean - square radius and axial charge ) , could be extremely useful .",
    "the literature is already rich of several theoretical studies @xcite and experimental proposals @xcite  of pv electron scattering from complex nuclei . in the case of the deuteron",
    ", the pv helicity asymmetry of the exclusive electrodisintegration cross section has also been considered @xcite .",
    "another opportunity not yet explored is given by the measurement of the pv asymmetry of the analyzing power arising in the scattering of unpolarized electrons from polarized protons . in principle , the pv target asymmetry is even more versatile than the pv beam asymmetry for disentangling the different weak form factors because the polarization of the proton target can be freely chosen whereas the electron beam can be polarized only along the beam momentum .    in this paper",
    "we intend to study such target asymmetry in the low q@xmath2 range and to analyze its potential for an experimental determination of the ewk form factors .",
    "the rapid and continuous improvements in the production of polarized targets @xcite   promise to make feasible in the near future such a measurement .",
    "in fact , experiments with polarized hydrogen targets are nowadays very common either using solid targets of hydrogenous compounds such as nh@xmath10 or butanol with external beams or gas targets with internal beams .",
    "high proton spin polarization ( @xmath11 ) can be achieved in solid targets using the method of dynamic nuclear polarization together with the @xmath12he/@xmath13he dilution refrigerator technique .",
    "also the polarization reversal is now a relatively fast process with high spin flip efficiency .",
    "further , the production of polarized internal targets in storage rings seems to be very promising because it allows one to have pure atomic species , high polarization and polarization reversibility on a time scale of msec .",
    "moreover , high thickness can be reached thanks to the laser optical pumping , together with a free choice of the spin orientation using helmholtz coils . in conclusion",
    ", a measurement of the pv analyzing power in the @xmath14 scattering seems within the reach of the present experimental capability , provided the entire apparatus is kept stable for the long time required .",
    "note that other more complicated pv observables are possible in the electron proton elastic scattering if both beam and target are polarized .",
    "however , they are out of the experimental feasibility at the moment , and thus we shall not consider them in this paper .    alternatively to the measurement of the pv asymmetry in the analyzing power , the pv polarization of the recoiling proton for unpolarized beam and target could be studied @xcite . however , even if the recoil polarimetry has developed rapidly in recent years , the pv longitudinal and sideways components of the polarization vector have values which are typically of the order of 10@xmath15 at low q@xmath2 , i.e. three - order of magnitude smaller than those measurable with the actual focal plane polarimeters .    a work on target asymmetry has been published some years ago by fayyazuddin and riazuddin @xcite   who limited their considerations to the longitudinal component of the analyzing power . however , their results are useful for the order of magnitude , at the most , because their analytic expression contains several errors ( an overall factor of 2 , a sign error and an erroneous dependence on the form factors in the eletromagnetic ( em ) - axial interference term ) .",
    "this is rather strange because the effects of the neutral currents in the elastic electron - proton scattering had already been considered by different authors in the 70 s , a few years after the appearance of the unified gauge theory of weak and em interactions @xcite .",
    "while much work was concentrated on the polarized beam asymmetry , in @xcite   the case of the polarized target asymmetry was also considered . in these papers",
    "the analytic expression of the pv target asymmetry is incorrect only in the sign of the em - axial interference term @xcite   or in the sign of the em - vector interference term @xcite .",
    "note that these papers were mainly concerned with the discrimination among various su(2)x u(1 ) models and other models based on larger gauge groups , such as su(2)@xmath16 x su(2)@xmath17 or su(3 ) x u(1 ) .",
    "finally , we have to mention that both pv beam and target asymmetries in the electron - proton scattering have also been investigated @xcite   in the gev range to detect manifestations of a possible nonstandard weak boson @xmath18 . in this",
    "paper analytic formulas for the asymmetries are not reported because they are evaluated in a numerical way starting from the ewk currents .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we describe our formulation of the elastic @xmath14 scattering and we give the expressions of the target asymmetries . in sec.3",
    "we present and discuss our numerical results .",
    "finally , in sec.4 we state our conclusions .",
    "the electron vector and axial - vector currents are given by the dirac form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the four - momentum and the covariant spin four - vector of the incoming and outgoing electron , respectively .",
    "we recall the properties @xmath35 and @xmath36 .        in the following , we do not need to care about the induced pseudoscalar current which , being proportional to @xmath45 , does not contribute to observables in pv electron scattering to leading order in ewk coupling when saturated with the leptonic tensor .",
    "assuming , as usual , the extreme relativistic limit ( erl ) for the electron ( @xmath46 ) and neglecting the purely weak component term , which is @xmath47 , the elastic cross section in the case of an unpolarized electron beam and a polarized nucleon target , can be written @xmath48 where we have averaged over the initial electron spin states and summed over the final ones .",
    "the effective weak coupling constant @xmath49 determining the magnitude of the pv effects in the low and medium @xmath7 is given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the well known symmetric and antisymmetric leptonic tensors , where @xmath52 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "note that in the literature are present other different ( but equivalent ) definitions of the hadronic tensor and of the structure functions obtained from each other by inserting or dropping terms proportional to @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( which give no contribution in the erl ) and using suitable identities  @xcite .    from the explicit calculation",
    "the non - zero form factors are @xmath59    let us introduce the notation @xmath60 to indicate the elastic cross section . as it is clear from the general structure of the hadronic tensor , eq.([e : w0s2 ] ) , @xmath61 can be written @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the contribution deriving from the initial nucleon polarization as obtained from the corresponding part of the hadronic tensors @xmath64}$ ] .      the cross section asymmetry due to the target polarization is defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the cross section when the initial proton is polarized along ( @xmath76 ) or opposite ( @xmath77 ) an arbitrary direction @xmath78 .",
    "then , from eq.([e : sigmas ] ) , we see that @xmath79 and only the interference terms contribute to the asymmetry ; moreover @xmath80 because the contribution deriving from the em - weak interference can be disregarded .    as for the reference frame",
    "we take , as usual , the y - axis orthogonal to the scattering plane ( @xmath81 ) , while for the direction of the z - axis there are substantially two possible choices : z - axis along the direction * k * of the incident beam or along the direction * q * of the momentum transfer . in both cases ,",
    "obviously , the only nonzero components of the asymmetry are those in the scattering plane , i.e. the transverse ( @xmath82 ) and the longitudinal ( @xmath83 ) ones .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the most convenient choice is to take the z - axis parallel to * q*. in fact , this choice leads to longitudinal and transverse asymmetries which correspond to the virtual compton scattering asymmetries @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the quantity actually measured in the deep inelastic electron proton scattering experiments with a polarized target , is the longitudinal asymmetry corresponding to the choice of the z - axis parallel to the beam momentum @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the correspondence with the virtual compton scattering asymmetries is more complex and @xmath83 becomes a combination of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "assuming @xmath87 , we obtain for @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath88    of course , the asymmetry components when the z - axis is parallel to * k * are related to the previous ones by a simple rotation in the scattering plane .",
    "in fact , if @xmath89 is the angle between * k * and * q * , we have , with obvious notations @xmath90 with @xmath91    coming back to eq.([e : aptxz ] ) , several observations are in order .",
    "first , @xmath83 does not depend on @xmath8 and then on the proton strangeness form factor @xmath92 .",
    "this follows from the fact that only the transverse components of the neutral currents contribute to @xmath83 .",
    "second , the dependence of @xmath83 on the proton axial form factor @xmath93 is lowered with respect to that on the proton weak magnetic form factor @xmath94 because @xmath95 , in particular at backward angles where @xmath96 .",
    "this means that the longitudinal asymmetry @xmath83 may be an useful quantity for an experimental determination of the proton strange magnetic moment , allowing for a measurement of @xmath97 complementary to that coming from the helicity asymmetry in the reaction @xmath98 as in the sample experiment .    in principle",
    ", this independence of @xmath8 makes more convenient a measurement of @xmath94 in the target asymmetry than in the helicity asymmetry of the @xmath99 reaction , @xmath9 , as it is clear recalling its expression @xcite @xmath100 }            { \\varepsilon ~g_e^2 +   \\tau g_m^2 }        ~~. \\label{e : aep2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by the way , the longitudinal target asymmetry coincides , apart from the sign , with the helicity asymmetry for backward scattering ( @xmath101 ) as a consequence of the helicity conservation in the erl for the electrons .    a final remark following from the comparison of @xmath9 with both the components of the target asymmetry , concerns the different sensitivity on @xmath93 due to the different dependence on @xmath72 . in fact , unlike @xmath9 , the terms containing the weak vector form factors in the target asymmetries , usually dominant because @xmath102 , are suppressed at forward angles ( @xmath103 ) by the kinematic factors making substantial the impact of @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , a determination of @xmath93 alternative to that deriving from @xmath104 scattering experiments could be carried out in this kind of pv electron scattering experiments . however , as in actual experiments the scattering angle can not be less than @xmath105 10@xmath106 , the suppression mentioned above is only partial and thus a good knowledge of the weak vector form factors is a prerequisite of such an experiment .      from the structure of the em and weak vector current operators in terms of the su(3)-singlet and -octet currents it follows that the nucleon weak vector form factors are given by @xmath107 with @xmath108=+1 ,  -1 for the proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "@xmath109 is the isoscalar ( isovector ) combination of the em sachs form factors , @xmath110 is the strange - quark contribution and the couplings are appropriate linear combinations of quark weak vector charges . in the standard model they have the values @xmath111",
    "very little is known about the values of @xmath97 and @xmath122 even if many calculations of the strangeness vector form factors have been carried out using different approaches ( lattice calculations , effective lagrangian , dispersion relations , hadronic models ) .",
    "the predictions of the strangeness moments are quite different in different approaches and can also largely vary within a given approach because of the need of additional assumptions and approximations .",
    "in particular , @xmath122 is predicted to be positive in the dispersion theory analysis of the nucleon isoscalar form factors  @xcite , of the same order of magnitude but negative by the chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite   and negative but of two order of magnitude smaller by the kaon - loop calculations  @xcite . a negative value of @xmath122 is also preferred by the analysis @xcite   of the @xmath123 elastic scattering data @xcite   which , however , has been criticized for the use of a unique cut - off mass for the three su(3 ) axial - vector form factors .",
    "the different existing models widely disagree also about sign and magnitude of @xmath97 which is predicted to range from @xmath124  @xcite   in the chiral hyperbag model to @xmath125  @xcite   using qcd equalities among the octet baryon magnetic moments .",
    "analogously to ( [ e : gemw ] ) , the axial - vector form factor can be decomposed in terms of the 3rd and 8th su(3 ) octet components and of the possible strange component @xmath126 with coupling constants dictated at the tree level by the quark axial charges @xmath127    note that in this limit the isoscalar component of @xmath128 fully comes from the strange quark contribution .",
    "information on the @xmath129 value of the su(3 ) octet form factors derives from charged current weak interactions . from neutron @xmath130-decay and strong isospin symmetry",
    "it follows @xmath131  @xcite , while from hyperon @xmath130-decays and flavor su(3 ) symmetry it follows @xmath132  @xcite , @xmath133 and @xmath134 being the associated su(3 ) reduced matrix elements .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of these form factors can be adequately parametrized with a dipole form @xmath135 with a cut - off mass @xmath136=1.032 gev .",
    "the same dipole form is suggested in @xcite   for the strange axial vector form factor @xmath137 here again , lacking theoretical constraints on @xmath138 and because of the model dependence of the theoretical estimates , values of @xmath139 have to be extracted from the experiments and the first indications came from the bnl @xmath140 experiment  @xcite   and from the emc data  @xcite .    as for the weak coupling constants we emphasize that the values ( [ e : csivector ] ) and ( [ e : csiaxial ] ) are those predicted by the ewk standard model at the tree - level . in a realistic evaluation of the amplitude of any electron - hadron process one",
    "has to consider the radiative corrections to these values .",
    "such corrections @xmath141 , amounting to a factor ( 1+@xmath141 ) in all the coupling constants except in @xmath142 which becomes @xmath143 , are very difficult to calculate because they receive contributions from a variety of processes ( higher - order terms in ewk theory , hadronic physics effects , ... ) .",
    "they have been estimated by various authors ( for a review see ref.@xcite   and citations therein ) using different approaches and approximations with results in qualitative agreement .",
    "more precisely , @xmath144 are estimated to be of the order of a few percent and @xmath145 of the order of some tenth of percent .",
    "therefore , while @xmath144 can be neglected , the radiative corrections @xmath145 must , in principle , be taken into account .",
    "in this paper we report our results on the polarized target asymmetry in the momentum transfer region @xmath146 1 ( gev / c@xmath2 ) . as for the parameters which determine the @xmath7 fall - off of the expressions ( [ e : gemstrani],[e : gastrano ] ) of the strange form factors , which are completely unknown , we take the values @xmath147 . while the value for @xmath148 is suggested by the analogy with the galster parametrization of @xmath149 , the choice for @xmath150 and @xmath151 seems to us rather reasonable as we do not consider too high @xmath7 values .    furthermore , as reference values for the axial radiative corrections we adopt @xmath152 and @xmath153 given by musolf and holstein @xcite   using for the hadronic contributions the so - called best estimates for the weak meson - nucleon vertices of ref.@xcite .",
    "on the contrary , lacking a reliable estimate of the radiative correction to the strangeness axial coupling constant , we take @xmath154 .",
    "finally , we use @xmath155 as reference value of the strangeness axial charge , as deduced from the neutrino scattering experiment  @xcite .",
    "let us start considering the angular distribution of the polarized target asymmetries .",
    "in fig.1 we plot @xmath156 and @xmath157 for @xmath7=0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , calculated with jaffe s value @xcite   of the strangeness radius ( @xmath122=0.16  fm@xmath2 ) and with the central experimental value of the strange magnetic moment ( @xmath159 ) @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries , which are quite small at forward angles , show a remarkably different angular dependence as @xmath160 increases .",
    "in fact , while @xmath156 increases very slowly , reaches a maximum for @xmath161 110@xmath106 and then decreases at backward angles , @xmath157 increases continuously with @xmath160 reaching at backward angles values which are one order of magnitude greater than those at forward angles .",
    "the angular behavior of the target asymmetries can be easily understood recalling their expression ( [ e : aptxz ] ) .",
    "in fact , at forward angles @xmath162 and the surviving term in both the asymmetries is that proportional to @xmath27 . on the contrary , at backward angles @xmath96 and @xmath163 while @xmath157 reaches its maximum .    for comparison ,",
    "we have also drawn in fig.1 the modulus of the helicity asymmetry @xmath164 which has an angular dependence very similar to that of @xmath157 .",
    "in fact , @xmath165 which is slightly greater than @xmath166 at forward angles , converges to @xmath166 for @xmath167 , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "there we pointed out that the longitudinal target asymmetry at backward angles may be an useful quantity for an experimental determination of @xmath97 . in order to show the effect on @xmath166 of variations in the strangeness magnetic moment we report in fig.2 our results at @xmath160=170@xmath106 for a selected set of predictions of @xmath97 . among the values given by the different models we have chosen those defining the theoretical range of @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath168 @xcite   and @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "also reported are the curves corresponding to the experimental value of @xmath97 @xcite   and to @xmath170 .",
    "note that the dirac strangeness radius has been held fixed , @xmath171  fm@xmath2 as deduced by jaffe .",
    "this comparison makes evident the sensitivity on @xmath97 of the target asymmetry for electrons scattered in the backward direction , sensitivity which is very strong for @xmath7=1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 but already noticeable even for lower @xmath7 values .    of course , because at backward angles @xmath166 and @xmath172 are nearly coincident",
    ", we can repeat for @xmath166 all the considerations made for @xmath9 on the precision reachable in an extraction of @xmath97 from a measurement of @xmath9 . for example , at @xmath7=0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , the uncertainties affecting the other quantities determining the asymmetries ( radiative corrections to the coupling constants , uncertainties in @xmath93 arising from @xmath139 and @xmath136 , ... ) make it necessary a measurement within a 10@xmath173 error to extract @xmath97 with a limit @xmath174 @xcite . in the previous section we pointed out that the longitudinal target asymmetry has the important characteristic of being independent of @xmath8 and then , in particular , of @xmath92 .",
    "unfortunately , the positive consequences of this fact , are made less significant by all the above mentioned uncertainties on the other parameters .    for completeness",
    ", we report in fig.3 the transverse target asymmetry @xmath175 , in the same kinematical conditions as before and for the same set of values of @xmath97 .",
    "even if @xmath175 shows a good sensitivity to @xmath97 , it is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath166 and then less suitable for an experimental measurement .    on the contrary",
    ", @xmath175 could be an useful quantity to constrain @xmath122 . according to eq.([e : aptxz ] ) , in order to minimize the impact of the poorly known @xmath93 , it is convenient to consider backward scattered electrons . the sensitivity of @xmath175 to the strangeness radius is shown in fig.4 , where we compare our results of @xmath175 for @xmath176 , having fixed the proton strangeness magnetic moment to its experimental value and for a restricted selection of predicted @xmath122 . besides that given by jaffe and @xmath177 , we have used the two almost opposite values @xmath178  fm@xmath2 , deduced by hammer et al .",
    "@xcite   in their revised dispersion analysis and @xmath179  fm@xmath2 obtained by kim et al .",
    "@xcite   in a chiral quark soliton model .    at first sight",
    ", a measurement of @xmath175 in the backward direction could lead to discriminate between the different models . actually , the precision on the extraction of @xmath122 from such experiment is strongly limited by the error induced by the uncertainty in the other quantities determining @xmath175 and particularly in @xmath97 . to be more quantitative on the precision reachable in a determination of @xmath122 , let us consider again the expression of @xmath175 , eq.([e : aptxz ] ) , and write it in the form @xmath180 which exibits the dependence on the strangeness radius , magnetic moment , axial charge and on the radiative corrections to the axial - vector coupling constants . the fractional change induced in the transverse asymmetry is given by @xmath181    the values of the coefficients in eq.([e : abcdex ] ) and ( [ e : dasuax ] ) for @xmath176 and @xmath182 are @xmath183=0.208  @xmath184 , @xmath185=-0.312 , @xmath186=0.172 , @xmath187=-0.048 , @xmath188=-0.136 , and it turns out that the impact of @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 on a determination of @xmath122 is strong .",
    "in fact , even with an experimental error of 10@xmath173 in the measurement of @xmath175 , assuming @xmath192 as estimated by musolf and holstein @xcite , @xmath193 as given by neutrino scattering experiments @xcite , and assuming to know @xmath97 within @xmath40.1 , one can not get for @xmath122 a precision better than @xmath194 .",
    "it is to be concluded that the transverse asymmetry compares only slightly favorably with the beam helicity asymmetry as for the determination of @xmath122 .    finally , we consider the possibilities provided by a measurement of target asymmetries for a determination of @xmath139 . in fig.5",
    "we plot @xmath175 and @xmath166 at forward angle ( @xmath160=10@xmath106 ) as a function of @xmath7 and for different values of @xmath139 within the range defined by neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the other parameters are taken at their reference values .",
    "the variations induced by @xmath139 are very similar in @xmath175 and @xmath166 , slowly increasing with @xmath7 and reach about 10@xmath173 at @xmath7=1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 . to give a quantitative estimate of the error with which @xmath139 could be extracted from a pv target asymmetry measurement , we limit our consideration to @xmath166 which does not take contribution from @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , analogously to eq.([e : dasuax ] ) , we have @xmath195 and from the evaluation at @xmath7=1 ( gev / c)@xmath2 and @xmath160=10@xmath106 , we obtain @xmath196=-0.243 , @xmath197=0.473 , @xmath198=-0.133 , @xmath199=-0.375 .",
    "clearly , the largest effects on @xmath166 come from the uncertainties in @xmath200 and @xmath139 , but also @xmath97 and @xmath201 have a sizeable impact .",
    "therefore , a good knowledge of the radiative corrections and a precise determination of @xmath97 are requested in order that a measurement of @xmath166 could be exploited for constraining the value of @xmath139 .",
    "the aim of this paper was to extend the possible pv observables which could be used for an experimental determination of the weak form factors of the proton .",
    "to this end we have considered the asymmetries of the elastic electron - proton scattering cross section arising from the polarization of the proton target .",
    "concerning such an experiment , it seems to us that it should become feasible in the near future because the tecnique of polarized target production has so much improved that it is nowadays possible to obtain hydrogen targets highly polarized , with an arbitrary direction of polarization , and with fast and efficient spin reversal .",
    "first of all , we have carefully rederived the expression of the cross section in the electroweak theory valid for an arbitrary target polarization .",
    "indeed , such a process was already addressed in the past by several authors but with incorrect results .",
    "then , we have decomposed the pv analyzing power , which is a vector lying in the scattering plane , considering the proton polarization along and perpendicular to the momentum transfer * q*. this is indeed the most convenient decomposition from the theoretical point of view , leading to a longitudinal asymmetry independent of the electric weak form factor . for comparison , we recall that the helicity asymmetry of the @xmath1 scattering depends also on @xmath8 .    however , the actual calculations of @xmath166 for backward angles , which is the most suitable kinematical situation for an experimental determination of @xmath97 , lead to an expected precision on @xmath97 which is of the same order as the one obtained in the helicity asymmetry experiment .    we have also shown that the transverse target asymmetry @xmath175 is rather sensitive to the strangeness radius @xmath122 in the case of backward detected electrons . however , it turns out from the calculations that the precision in the extraction of @xmath122 is strongly limited by the uncertainties in the other quantities ( particularly in @xmath97 ) affecting @xmath175 .",
    "another peculiarity of the target asymmetries @xmath175 and @xmath166 with respect to the beam asymmetry , is that their dependence on the axial form factor can be enhanced over that on the vector form factors .",
    "in fact , in the strict forward scattering ( @xmath160 = 0@xmath106 ) with the electron kinematical parameter @xmath72=1 , the target asymmetries are determined by @xmath93 only . in practice ,",
    "the finite dimensions of the detectors prevent too small scattering angles so that the influence of @xmath8 and @xmath94 can be greatly reduced but non completely cancelled .",
    "anyway , a measurement of the target asymmetries in this kinematics could be useful for independently constraining the value of @xmath202 given by the neutrino scattering experiments .",
