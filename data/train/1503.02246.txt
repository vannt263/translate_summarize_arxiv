    "the values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in tables [ tab : q1:lc ] and [ tab : t5:lc ] were combined according to their weighted mean , inflating the resulting errorbars to enforce @xmath11 for each quantity .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements of the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) , metallicity @xmath13}}\\right)$ ] and orbital velocity amplitude ( @xmath14 ) were taken from published studies and are summarised in table[tab : spec ] .",
    "tabulated predictions were obtained from the @xcite , y@xmath15 @xcite , teramo @xcite , vrss @xcite and dsep @xcite stellar models .    for each target",
    "we began by estimating a value for the velocity amplitude of the _ planet _ , @xmath16 , allowing us to calculate a set of physical properties for the system using standard formulae .",
    "the value of @xmath16 was then iteratively refined to maximise the agreement between the observed and predicted @xmath12 , and the measured @xmath8 and predicted @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the full procedure was undertaken using each of the five sets of stellar model predictions .",
    "for both objects we assumed a circular orbit , based on the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the set of physical constants given by @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on the input parameters were propagated through the analysis using a perturbation approach , and added in quadrature to give the final random error .",
    "a systematic errorbar was also estimated based on the interagreement between the results obtained using each of the five different model sets .",
    "table[tab : model ] gives our final physical properties , random errorbars for all quantities , and systematic errorbars for those results which depend on stellar theory .",
    "also , only for qatar-1a , we were able to calculate the stellar rotation period .",
    "thus , we can use gyrochronology model to estimate stellar the age of qatar-1b host star . using the model from @xcite and stellar rotation period 23.697 days and b - v=1.06",
    ", we estimate the age of qatar-1a @xmath18 gyr .",
    "our final results for qatar-1 are in good agreement with published studies @xcite , and yield a significant improvement in precision . in the case of tres-5",
    "we agree with the findings of @xcite but do not obtain significantly smaller errorbars .",
    "this is because we account for systematic errors whereas @xcite do not , and also because the errors estimated by @xcite appear to be too small ( for example they claim that the orbital inclination is @xmath19 degrees , a level of precision not normally achieved even with _",
    "kepler _ or _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "light curves ) .",
    "our results are therefore to be preferred to those of @xcite because they are based on a larger and more precise dataset , and because our errorbars have been more robustly calculated .",
    "we present extensive optical photometry of transit events in two extrasolar planetary systems with k - dwarf host stars .",
    "our data comprise 12 light curves of qatar-1 and eight light curves of tres-5 .",
    "these data include simultaneous observations in three passbands of one transit for each object .",
    "we use thse data to search for starspot crossing events during transit , with a negative result .",
    "we do , however , measure the rotational period of @xmath5d for qatar-1a from the survey photometry in its discovery paper , showing that this does display spot activity .",
    "the corresponding rotational velocity is close to the @xmath7 value measured from an observation of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in this system , so its low projected orbital obliquity also implies a low true orbital obliquity .",
    "the lack of observed spot crossings may be due to the planets crossing latitudes of the stars which show low spot activity , i.e.  the planetary chords miss the active latitudes of the stellar surfaces .",
    "we use our data to measure the photometric parameters of both systems . when combined with published spectroscopic quantities , these yield precise measurements of the full physical properties of the systems . qatar-1 and tres-5 have notable similarities in their respective stellar properties , and planetary equilibrium temperature , radius and density",
    ". our results also yield refined measurements of the orbital ephemerides of the systems .",
