    "it was shown that one - particle model mentioned above does not describe the total @xmath2 ( neutron - antineutron ) transition probability as well as the channel corresponding to absorption of the @xmath4-particle ( antineutron ) .",

    "2a represents two consecutive subprocesses . the speed and probability of the whole process",
    "are defined by those of the slower subprocess . if @xmath76 , the annihilation can be considered instantaneous .",
    "so , the probability of process ( 1 ) is defined by the speed of the @xmath0 transition : @xmath77 .",
    "distribution ( 20 ) leads to very strong restriction on the free - space @xmath0 oscillation time [ 10,13 ] : @xmath78",
    "we show that for the @xmath0 transition in medium the corrections to the models and additional baryon - number - violating processes ( see fig .",
    "3 ) can not essentially change the results .",
    "first of all we consider the incoherent contribution of the diagrams 3 . in fig",
    ". 3a a meson is radiated before the @xmath0 transition .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian has the form @xmath79 in the following the background neutron potential is omitted .",
    "the neutron wave function is given by ( 5 ) , were @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "for the process amplitude @xmath82 one obtains @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the 4-momentum of meson radiated , @xmath86 is the amplitude of antineutron annihilation in the medium in the @xmath87 mesons . as with model",
    "* a * , the antineutron propagator @xmath88 is _ bare _ ; the @xmath12 self - energy @xmath89 .",
    "( the same is true for figs .",
    "3b-3d . )",
    "if @xmath90 , the amplitude @xmath82 increases since @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( the limiting transition @xmath90 for the diagram 3a is an imaginary procedure because in the vertex @xmath93 the real meson is escaped and so @xmath94 . )",
    "the fact that the amplitude increases is essential for us because for fig .",
    "2a @xmath95 . due to this @xmath39 and @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be the widths corresponding to the fig . 3a and annihilation width of @xmath12 in the @xmath99 mesons , respectively ; @xmath100 . taking into account that @xmath98 is a smooth function of @xmath101 and summing over @xmath99 , it is easy to get the estimation : @xmath102    the time - dependence is determined by the exponential decay law : @xmath103 comparing with ( 15 ) we have : @xmath104 .",
    "so for the model * b * the contribution of diagram 3a is negligible .",
    "for the model * a * the contribution of diagram 3a is inessential as well . indeed , using eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 20 ) we get @xmath105 where we have put @xmath106 . consequently , if @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( see ( 20 ) ) then the contribution of diagram 3a is negligible . for the @xmath0 transition in nuclei these conditions",
    "are fulfilled since in this case @xmath109 mev and @xmath110 yr , where @xmath111 is the observation time in proton - decay type experiment [ 18 ] . ) in fact , it is suffice to hold condition ( 30 ) only because it is more strong .    in the calculations made above",
    "the free - space @xmath0 transition operator has been used .",
    "this is impulse approximation which is employed for nuclear @xmath112 decay , for instance .",
    "the simplest medium correction to the vertex ( or off - diagonal mass , or transition mass ) is shown in fig .",
    "3b . in this event",
    "the replacement should be made : @xmath113 @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the correction to @xmath29 produced by the diagram 3b .",
    "for the model * a * the limit becomes @xmath116 obviously , the @xmath117 can not change the order of magnitude of @xmath118 since the @xmath119 operator is essentially zero - range one .",
    "the free - space @xmath0 transition comes from the exchange of higgs bosons with the mass @xmath120 gev [ 5 ] . since @xmath121 ( @xmath122 is the mass of @xmath123-boson )",
    ", the renormalization effects should not exceed those characteristic of nuclear @xmath112 decay which is less than 0.25 [ 19 ] .",
    "so the medium corrections to the vertex are inessential for us .",
    "the same is true for the model * b*.    consider now the baryon - number - violating decay @xmath124 [ 20 ] shown in fig .",
    "it leads to the same final state , as the processes depicted in figs .",
    "2 , 3a and 3b . denoting @xmath125 , for the decay width",
    "@xmath126 one obtains @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "the parameter @xmath129",
    "corresponding to the vertex @xmath124 is unknown and so no detailed calculation is possible .",
    "the baryon - number - violating conversion @xmath130 in the medium [ 20 ] shown in fig .",
    "3d can not produce interference , since it contains @xmath131-meson in the final state .",
    "for the rest of the diagrams the significant interferences are unlikely because the final states in @xmath132 annihilation are very complicated configurations and persistent phase relations between different amplitudes can not be expected .",
    "this qualitative picture is confirmed by our calculations [ 21 ] for @xmath133-nuclear annihilation .",
    "it is easy to verify the following statement : if the incoherent contribution of the diagrams 3a-3c to the total nuclear annihilation width is taken into account , the lower limit on the free - space @xmath0 oscillation time @xmath134 becomes even better .",
    "to summarise , the contribution of diagrams 3 is inessential for us .",
    "the non - trivial circumstance is the quadratic time - dependence in the model * a * : @xmath135 .",
    "the heart of the problem is as follows .",
    "the processes depicted by the diagrams 2b and 3 are described by the exponential decay law . in the first vertex of these diagrams",
    "the momentum transfer ( figs .",
    "3a-3c ) , or effective momentum transfer ( figs .",
    "2b , 3d ) takes place .",
    "the diagram 2a contains the infrared divergence conditioned by zero momentum transfer in the @xmath0 transition vertex .",
    "this is unremovable perculiarity .",
    "this means that the standard @xmath1-matrix approach is inapplicable [ 10,13,17 ] .",
    "in such an event , the other surprises can be expected as well . from this standpoint",
    "a non - exponential behaviour comes as no surprise to us .",
    "it seems natural that for non - singular and singular diagrams the functional structure of the results is different , including the time - dependence .",
    "the opposite situation would be strange .",
    "the fact that for the processes with @xmath95 the @xmath1-matrix problem formulation @xmath136 is physically incorrect can be seen even from the limiting case @xmath137 : if @xmath138 ( see ( 6 ) ) , the solution is periodic .",
    "it is obtained by means of non - stationary equations of motion and not @xmath1-matrix theory . to reproduce the limiting case @xmath139",
    ", i.e. the periodic solution , we have to use the approach with finite time interval .    if the problem is formulated on the interval @xmath140 , the decay width @xmath17 can not be introduced since @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "this means that the standard calculation scheme should be completely revised .",
    "( we would like to emphasise this fact . )",
    "the direct calculation by means of evolution operator gives the distribution ( 20 ) .",
    "formally , the different time - dependence is due to @xmath85-dependence of amplitudes .",
    "we consider eq .",
    "( 23 ) , for instance .",
    "if @xmath85 decreases , the amplitude @xmath82 increase ; in the limit @xmath90 it is singular ( see ( 25 ) ) .",
    "the point @xmath95 corresponds to realistic process shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath75-dependence of this process is the consequence of the zero momentum transfer .",
    "the more physical explanation of the @xmath75-dependence is as follows . in the hamiltonian ( 22 )",
    "corresponding to fig .",
    "3a we put @xmath143",
    ". then the virtual decay @xmath144 takes place .",
    "the first vertex of the diagram 3a dictates the exponential decay law of the overall process shown in fig .",
    "similarly , in the hamiltonian ( 6 ) corresponding to fig .",
    "2a , we put @xmath137 .",
    "then the free - space @xmath0 transition takes place which is quadratic in time : @xmath145 .",
    "the first vertex determines the time - dependence of the whole process at least for small @xmath17 .",
    "we also recall that even for proton decay the possibility of non - exponential behaviour is realistic [ 22 - 24 ] .",
    "the sole physical distinction between models * a * and * b * is the zero antineutron self - energy in the model * a * ; or , similarly , the definition of antineutron annihilation amplitude .",
    "however , it leads to the fundamentally different results .    if @xmath47 , @xmath146 diverges quadratically .",
    "this circumstance should be clarified ; otherwise the model * b * can be rejected .",
    "the calculation in the framework of the model * a * gives the finite result , which justifies our approach from a conceptual point of view and consideration of the model * a * at least as the limiting case .",
    "in reality the model * a * seems quite realistic in itself .",
    "indeed , we list the main drawbacks of the model * b*.      \\2 ) the diagram 2b means that the annihilation is turned on upon forming of the self - energy part @xmath41 ( after multiple rescattering of @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is counter - intuitive since at low energies [ 25,26 ] @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the cross sections of free - space @xmath132 annihilation and @xmath132 scattering , respectively .",
    "the inverse picture is in order : in the first stage of the @xmath12-medium interaction the annihilation occurs .",
    "this is obvious for the @xmath0 transitions in the gas .",
    "the model * a * reproduces the _ competition _ between scattering and annihilation in the intermediate state [ 27 ] .",
    "\\3 ) the time - dependence is a more important characteristic of any process .",
    "it is common knowledge that the @xmath151-dependence of the process probability in the vacuum and medium is identical ( for example , exponential decay law ( 15 ) ) . in the model * a * the @xmath151-dependencies in the vacuum and medium coincide : @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the model * b * gives @xmath154 , whereas @xmath153 .",
    "there is no reason known why we have such a fundamental change .",
    "however , there is fundamental problem in the model * a * : the singularity of the amplitude ( 19 ) .",
    "the approach with finite time interval gives the finite result , which justifies the models * a * and * b * at least in principle .",
    "nevertheless , the time - dependence @xmath152 and limit ( 21 ) seem very unusual .",
    "the corresponding calculation contains too many new elements . due to this",
    "we view the results of the model * a * with certain caution .",
    "besides , due to the zero momentum transfer in the @xmath0-transition vertex , the model is extremely sensitive to the @xmath42 .",
    "the process under study is _",
    "unstable_. the small change of antineutron self - energy @xmath156 , or , similarly , effctive momentum transfer in the @xmath0 transition vertex converts the model * a * to the model * b * : @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "( for the processes with non - zero momentum transfer the result is little affected by small change of @xmath85 . ) although we do nt see the specific reasons for similar scenario , it must not be ruled out .",
