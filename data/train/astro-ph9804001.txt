    "population synthesis models and stellar evolutionary isochrones are the tools which give age estimates for galaxies and star clusters , thus providing a constraint on the age of the universe .",
    "the models , however , are dependent upon the transformations from effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) , surface gravity , and abundance to observed colors and magnitudes . in the case of metal - poor giants ,",
    "these transformations remain inconclusive , despite considerable efforts in the past .    in 1966 , johnson produced a remarkable set of tables that gives color - color sequences in @xmath13 passbands for local dwarfs , giants , and supergiants ( of nearly solar metallicity , since metal - poor stars are rare in the disk ) , based on his and his collaborators extensive photometry efforts .",
    "he calculated the absolute flux in each passband to obtain bolometric corrections and effective temperatures . for giants ,",
    "this temperature scale has been subsequently revised ( dyck et al . 1996 ; dibenedetto 1993 ; ridgway et al . 1980 )",
    "but the color - color sequences are still used in many contexts , including assigning colors to theoretical isochrones and computing colors for integrated light population models .",
    "since 1966 , new passbands have become standard for broadband photometry .",
    "these are the cousins ( 1980a , b ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters at roughly 0.68@xmath14 m and 0.79@xmath14 m , and the cit ( elias et al .",
    "1982 ; `` cit '' stands for california institute of technology ) @xmath15 filter at 1.6@xmath14 m . with these new filters ,",
    "it is clear that more comprehensive color - color tables are necessary .",
    "one powerful way to generate a complete color - color table is to compute theoretical line - blanketed stellar spectra and convolve them with filter response functions to synthesize colors ( e.g. buser & kurucz 1979 ; bell & gustafsson 1978 , 1989 ; kurucz 1992 ) .",
    "the only major detriment to this approach is that , owing to the complexity of the problems of opacity and convection , the theoretical fluxes match imperfectly with real stellar fluxes .",
    "systematic color drifts can be seen when theoretical results are compared to an empirical color - color table ( cf .",
    "worthey 1994 ) .",
    "empirical tables are therefore of primary interest , for use by themselves or for use as a check of the theoretical color calibrations .",
    "the most complete empirical calibration attempted to date was done by green ( 1988 ) for use in the revised yale isochrones ( green et al .",
    "1987 ) . for green s work ,",
    "solar neighborhood @xmath0 photometry was assembled , and a temperature scale was attached via the @xmath16 color .",
    "the extension to different metallicities was accomplished by using theoretical color results .",
    "the green calibration is imperfect ; while problems with fitting isochrones ( corbally 1996 ) may be due to the temperature of the evolutionary tracks rather than the color calibration , the green colors differ from other literature calibrations ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "a problem with bolometric corrections ( tiede , frogel , & terndrup 1995 ; mould 1992 ) has also been noticed , but the color calibration has not yet been redone .    as part of an effort to redo this color calibration ,",
    "a literature search conducted by worthey and fisher ( 1996 ) discovered a paucity of observations in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 passbands for metal - poor giants .",
    "new observations at the michigan - dartmouth - mit ( mdm ) observatory were proposed to help fill this @xmath17 gap and to provide empirical relations between the various colors for different metallicities .",
    "we selected globular clusters of known metallicity , with previous @xmath18 ( and sometimes @xmath19 ) photometry , and specifically stars observed in @xmath1 by frogel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and cohen et al .",
    "( 1978 ) . in order to extend the metallicity range of our data to higher [ fe / h ] values , ngc 6791 was added to the list .",
    "unreduced @xmath1 photometry exists and , we expect , will soon be available to complete the color sequence for this cluster .",

    "the observations were obtained during the nights of april 11 , 12 , and 13 , 1997 , at the mdm observatory mcgraw - hill 1.3 m telescope . a schott glass @xmath0 filter set fabricated to match the johnson - cousins system was used with a uv - coated tek 1024 ccd .",

    ", 10 biases were combined for the bias subtraction .",
    "the flats were produced by combining between 3 and 6 twilight flat images per night per filter .",
    "the processed data were reduced using dophot ( schechter et al . 1993 ) . because the point spread function ( psf ) of the stars varied with position on the ccd , we adjusted the values of some of the input parameters of dophot to obtain accurate photometry results .",
    "in particular , we used the variable psf feature of dophot and , in some cases , lowered dophot s sensitivity with respect to detecting nearby neighbors of stars .",
    "the latter was done in order to avoid false multiple detections of individual , slightly elongated stellar images .",
    "dophot s photometry output contains a list of aperture corrections for stars with small photometric errors and without nearby neighbors . in order to apply the correct aperture correction for each of our target stars , we selected from this list the stars far away from the cluster , so as to avoid aperture corrections influenced by the higher sky value in the immediate vicinity of the cluster . with the fairly large field of view of the ccd",
    ", this method left us with between roughly 10 and 240 isolated stars with high s / n ratios for the various images . using these stars , the dependence ( if any ) of the aperture correction upon position on the ccd was determined , using a linear fit in @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the f - test ( cf .",
    "press et al .",
    "1992 ) was used to determine if fits which included @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms were statistically different from a constant value for the aperture correction applied over the whole chip .    during our three photometric nights",
    ", we observed a total of 10 landolt ( 1992 ) fields , at airmass values ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . using the iraf photcal package , we applied standard star solutions for all three nights of the form    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    where the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the fitted constants , @xmath33 is the airmass of the exposure taken with the respective filter , the lowercase magnitudes are instrumental , and the uppercase ones are the final calibrated magnitudes .",

    "roughly two - thirds of the program stars were observed only on one night ( usually 3 ccd frames per filter , 2 frames for the @xmath19 filter ) , but about one - third of the stars were observed on two nights .",
    "for all the stars , the @xmath34 magnitudes and colors were averaged arithmetically .",
    "the photometric scatter between nights 2 and 3 , based on 8 stars in ngc 6791 , is around 0.01 mag for @xmath35 and about 0.015 mag for @xmath36 colors . with only 8 stars ,",
    "the estimated error of our photometry for these nights is the photometric scatter divided by @xmath37 , which is around 0.004 mag and 0.005 mag for @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the rms of the standard star solutions ( table 1 ) .    however , for 7 globular cluster stars in common between nights 1 and 2 , the colors matched to a photometric scatter of 0.03 mag for all colors , significantly larger than what the standard star solutions imply .",
    "the @xmath5 colors for these stars were also systematically different by 0.05 mag . for these reasons , night",

    "only two stars were observed in night 1 alone , and these are marked in table 2 .",
    "reduced magnitudes and errors for our program giants ( luminosity class 3 ) are given in table 2 .",
    "the `` err1 '' column gives a magnitude error estimate based on the number of observations and the scatter between individual measurements .",
    "the error is quantized in 0.005-mag steps .",
    "colors involving the @xmath19 filter should be assumed to have 50% larger errors than the `` err1 '' entry would suggest .",
    "the `` err2 '' column contains an entry if one or more filters had few observations or if there was extra scatter between measurements .",
    "for instance , an entry of `` .03ui '' means that any color involving @xmath19 or @xmath3 should be considered to have an error of 0.03 mag .",

    "by contrast , three ngc 6791 stars in common with harris & canterna ( 1981 ) compare with @xmath41 .",
    "it thus seemed that @xmath42 increased with increasing [ fe / h ] values , and we considered various filter defects that could generate this metallicity trend .",
    "however , the behavior is counter to that expected from a red leak , and the uv coating on the ccd should make the overall @xmath19 filter response fairly similar to the original , so we believe that we have approximated the landolt standard system very well , as implied by the standard star solutions .",
    "the other colors did not display such a trend .",
    "literature @xmath5 values were found for 42 program stars ( cathey ( 1974 ) ; arp ( 1955 ) ; arp ( 1962 ) ; kaluzny ( 1993 , private communication ) ; cudworth ( 1995 , private communication ) ; harris & canterna ( 1981 ) ; kinman ( 1965 ) ; kaluzny & rucinski ( 1995 ) ) , and the overall average @xmath43 . concentrating on the most recent data , the three ngc 6791 stars in common with harris & canterna ( 1981 ) give @xmath44 , and the three stars in common with kaluzny & rucinski ( 1995 ) give @xmath45 .",

    "the major goal of this study is to explicitly reveal the metallicity dependence of broad - band colors .",
    "for instance , @xmath48 has long been used to estimate the metallicity of faint stars ( e.g. van den bergh 1962 ) .",
    "figures [ ubvk ] , [ bvvk ] , [ vrvk ] , [ vivk ] , [ jkvk ] , and [ hkvk ] show the various dereddened colors versus @xmath49 for giants of widely differing metal abundances , including the globular cluster giants from this work .",
    "@xmath49 is chosen because it is an excellent temperature indicator for gkm giants , with a large color range compared to its observational uncertainty .",
    "in addition , the best model fluxes show no metallicity sensitivity .",
    "that is , one temperature - @xmath49 conversion is applicable to stars of all abundances , at least in the 4000k to 5000k range ( e.g. bessell et al .",

    "serious users may want to refer to the original temperature calibration table .",
    "our photometry plus the worthey & fisher ( 1996 ) literature photometry , all dereddened , produced relations summarized here as six formulae giving colors as a function of @xmath49 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "much of the literature photometry comes from the machine readable version of morel & magnenat ( 1978 ) and is on the johnson system .",
