    "the chemical potential of the bulk of the ti is tuned into the conduction bands , so there is a kondo peak near the chemical potential and the bound states are occupied by a single electron .",
    "when @xmath193 exceeds a critical value @xmath218 , the order parameter @xmath206 begins to increase from zero , then quickly to @xmath229 with the increase of @xmath193 .",
    "figure 8(b ) shows the density of states of the impurity as a function of energy for @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 . with the increase of @xmath193 , the resonance peak splits .",
    "the splitting of the kondo peak increases with @xmath193 . as a result",
    ", the density of states near @xmath230 reduces to a very small value , corresponding to the self - screening of the kondo resonance .",
    "it should be noted that the strength of exchange interaction between the impurity and the in - gap bound state is the key parameter of the predicted self - screened kondo effect .",
    "the exchange strength should be evaluated subtly , for instance , from the first - principles calculation .",
    "our calculation indicates that a small exchange interaction could make the kondo effect break down .    above we assumed that the bound states are singly - occupied in the large - u limit .",
    "if the coulomb repulsion energy on the bound states is finite and the chemical potential is high enough , it is possible that the bound states are occupied by two electrons , and they form a singlet due to the pauli exclusion principle . in this limit",
    ", the bound - state spin is decoupled from the impurity spin , and the kondo effect originating from the interaction between the impurity spin and conduction electrons can recover .",
    "an impurity- or vacancy- induced in - gap bound state is a special feature of tis , which is absent in normal insulators .",
    "therefore , the bound state may play an important role when the kondo physics is considered in tis . for a strong exchange interaction between impurity and in - gap",
    "bound state , the kondo effect may be broken down when the chemical potential is tuned properly .",
    "actually , several experiments have been performed to investigate the physical properties of magnetic impurity - doped topological materials , such as mn - doped bite.@xcite the self - screening effect is expected to be observed in these systems .",
    "in summary , we have studied the kondo effect and the formation of in - gap bound states induced by an anderson impurity coupled with the bulk states of topological insulators .",
    "it is demonstrated that the positions of the kondo peak and bound states strongly depend on the topological properties , the chemical potential , and other parameters of the system .",
    "the behaviors of the resonance level in the bulk of tis differ from those for simple metals and normal insulators . due to the divergence of the density of states near the band edges ,",
    "the mixed - valence regime is much broader in the band - inverted case , while it shrinks to a very narrow regime in the normal case . for the band - inverted case , the in - gap bound states and the kondo resonance can coexist .",
    "however , only one of them exists in the normal insulators . when the impurity energy level is far away from the chemical potential , the in - gap bound states are very close to the band edges and",
    "can be considered as merging into the bulk .",
    "furthermore , we show that a self - screening kondo effect may be induced by taking the interaction between the impurity spin and bound - state spin into account .",
