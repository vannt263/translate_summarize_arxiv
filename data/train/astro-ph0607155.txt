    "ever since it was realized that the torque exerted by a protoplanetary disk onto an orbiting protoplanet could vary its semi - major axis on a time scale much shorter than the disk lifetime @xcite , many efforts have been made to determine the direction and rate of this semi - major axis change , referred to as planetary migration . during two decades",
    ", this problem was essentially tackled through linear analytical estimates of the disk torque onto a point - like perturber .",
    "the torque on a planet in a circular orbit can be split into two components : the differential lindblad torque and the corotation torque",
    ". early work on planetary migration consisted in determining the sign and value of the differential lindblad torque in a two - dimensional disk @xcite , since this torque , in the linear regime , typically exceeds the coorbital corotation torque and therefore dictates the direction and timescale of planetary migration . this work indicated that planetary migration in most cases corresponds to an orbital decay towards the center , and that it is a fast process , thus posing a threat for the survival of protoplanets embedded in protoplanetary disks .",
    "later efforts focused on the corotation torque @xcite and on the disk s vertical extent and pressure effects on the differential lindblad torque @xcite .",
    "the analytical predictions in the linear regime were checked by numerical integration of the differential equations @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have given an expression of the tidal torque , in the linear regime , that takes into account both the lindblad and coorbital corotation torques , and that fully takes into account the three dimensional structure of the disk .",
    "these analytical or semi - analytical studies all consider small mass planets , for which a linear approximation of the disk response is valid .",
    "other studies dealt with a strongly non - linear case , that of embedded giant planets @xcite .",
    "they showed that a giant planet tidally truncates the disk by opening a gap around its orbit , and that it is then locked in the viscous disk evolution , a process that was much later referred to as type ii migration @xcite . a more recent work @xcite considers the case of sub - giant planets ( planets which have a mass of the order of a saturn mass , if the central object has a solar mass ) embedded in massive disks .",
    "this work shows that the coorbital corotation torque may have a strong impact on the migration , and can lead to a runaway of the latter , either inwards or outwards .",
    "as this mechanism heavily relies upon the finite width of the horseshoe region , it also corresponds to a non - linear mechanism .",
    "the onset of non - linear effects should therefore occur below a sub - giant planet mass , but the first manifestation of these effects and their impact on planetary migration have not been investigated thus far .",
    "@xcite , by writing the flow equations in dimensionless units , have shown that the flow non - linearity is controlled by a parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the planet mass to star mass ratio and @xmath6 is the disk aspect ratio .",
    "the linear limit corresponds to @xmath7 , while the condition @xmath8 has been considered as a necessary condition for gap clearance , and has sometimes been referred to as the gap opening thermal criterion , although a recent work by @xcite has revisited the conditions for gap opening .    in the last few years",
    ", the increase of computational resources has made possible the evaluation of the disk torque exerted on an embedded planet by means of hydrodynamical calculations , both in two dimensions @xcite and three dimensions @xcite , both for small mass planets and for giant planets .",
    "in particular , the case of small mass planets allows comparison with analytical linear estimates .",
    "this was done by @xcite and @xcite , who compared the torques they measured with the estimate by @xcite .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite found results in good agreement with linear expectations , @xcite found a significant discrepancy for planet masses in the range @xmath9@xmath1 .",
    "namely , they found that migration in this planet mass range may be more than one order of magnitude slower than expected from linear estimates . in the same vein , @xcite found that planetary migration for the same planet masses can be much slower , or even reversed , compared to linear estimates . since the migration of protoplanetary cores of this mass constitutes a bottleneck for the build up of giant planets cores ( as this build up is slow , while the migration of these cores is fast ) , it is fundamental to establish whether this effect is real and , if confirmed , to investigate the reasons of this behavior .",
    "we shall hereafter refer to this discrepancy as _",
    "the offset_.    we adopt for the presentation of our results a heuristic approach that consists first in presenting the set of properties that we could infer from our calculations , and then in interpreting and illustrating them through the appropriate analysis . besides its pedagogical interest , this approach also closely follows our own approach to this problem .    in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    ", we describe the two independent codes that we used to check the properties of the offset , and we give the numerical setup used by each of these codes . in section  [ sec : properties ] we list the set of properties of the offset that our numerical experiments allowed us to identify , namely :    * the offset scales with the vortensity gradient ( the vortensity being defined as the vertical component of the vorticity divided by the surface density ) . *",
    "the offset value varies over the horseshoe libration timescale , and tends to small values at small viscosity , whereas it remains large at high viscosity .",
    "* the maximum relative offset occurs for a planet mass that scales as @xmath10 .",
    "we then interpret these properties as due to a non - linear behavior of the coorbital corotation torque that exceeds its linearly estimated value .",
    "using the link between coorbital corotation torque and horseshoe zone drag @xcite , we perform in section  [ sec : stream ] a streamline analysis in order to check whether the coorbital corotation torque excess is associated to a horseshoe zone width excess .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case . in section  [ sec : bernou ] , we relate this width excess of the horseshoe region to a transition of the flow properties in the planet vicinity , from the linear regime to the large mass case in which a circumplanetary disk surrounds the planet .",
    "we finally discuss in section  [ sec : discuss ] the importance of these properties for the migration of sub - critical solid cores .",
    "we sum up our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we used two independent hydro - codes to perform our tidal torque estimates .",
    "one of these codes is the 3d nested grid code nirvana , the other one is the 2d polar code fargo .",
    "the use of these codes was complementary : while fargo suffers from the 2d restriction and its outcome is plagued by the use of a gravitational softening length , it enables one to perform a wide exploration of the parameter space ( mainly , in our case , in term of planet mass , surface density slope , disk thickness and viscosity ) .",
    "the properties suggested by the fargo runs can later be confirmed by much more cpu - demanding 3d runs with nirvana .",
    "this code is a descendant of an early version of the mhd code nirvana @xcite , hence the name . for the current application ,",
    "the magnetic terms in the mhd equations are excluded .",
    "the code features a covariant eulerian formalism that allows to work in cartesian , cylindrical , or spherical polar coordinates in one , two , or three dimensions .",
    "the mhd equations are solved on a staggered mesh , with a constant spacing in each coordinate direction via a directional splitting procedure , whereby the advection part and the source terms are dealt with separately .",
    "the advection of the hydrodynamic variables is performed by means of a second - order accurate scheme that uses a monotonic slope limiter @xcite , enforcing global conservation of mass and angular momentum .",
    "viscous forces are implemented in a covariant tensor formalism .",
    "the code allows a static mesh refinement through a hierarchical nested - grid structure @xcite .",
    "the resolution increases by a factor @xmath11 in each direction from a sub - grid level to the next nested level .",
    "when employed in a 3d geometry , this technique produces an effective refinement of a factor @xmath12 from one grid level to the next one .",
    "the fargo code is a staggered mesh hydro - code on a polar grid , with upwind transport and a harmonic , second order slope limiter @xcite .",
    "it solves the navier - stokes and continuity equations for a keplerian disk subject to the gravity of the central object and that of embedded protoplanets .",
    "it uses a change of rotating frame on each ring that enables one to increase significantly the time step @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical solver of fargo resembles the widely known one of the zeus code @xcite , except for the handling of momenta advection .",
    "the coriolis force is treated so as to enforce angular momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "the mesh is centered on the primary .",
    "it is therefore non - inertial .",
    "the frame acceleration is incorporated in a so - called potential indirect term .",
    "the full viscous stress tensor in cylindrical coordinates of the navier - stokes equations is implemented in fargo .",
    "a more detailed list of its properties can be found on its websitemasset / fargo ] .      as is customary in numerical calculations of disk - planet tidal interactions , we use the planet orbital radius @xmath13 as the length unit , the mass of the central object @xmath14 as the mass unit , and @xmath15 as the time unit , where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , which is @xmath17 in our unit system",
    "whenever we quote a planet mass in earth masses , we assume the central object to have a solar mass .",
    "we note @xmath18 the planet mass and @xmath5 the planet to star mass ratio .",
    "both codes use an isothermal equation of state with a given radial temperature ( or sound speed ) profile .",
    "if @xmath19 is the ( vertically integrated for fargo ) pressure and @xmath20 the ( vertically integrated for fargo ) gas density , then the equation of state is @xmath21 .",
    "the disk vertical scale - height is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the disk angular frequency at radius  @xmath24 .",
    "the disk aspect ratio , @xmath25 , is taken uniform in the disks that we simulate , and it varies from @xmath26 to @xmath27 depending on the runs .",
    "the softening length is applied to the planet potential in the following manner :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the planet potential , @xmath30 the distance to the planet , and @xmath31 is the softening length .    in all the runs presented in this work , the planet is held on a fixed circular orbit .",
    "moreover , there is no gas accretion onto the planet .",
    "this is quite different from the prescription of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we shall see that the effect we investigate is related to the coorbital corotation torque , which itself is related to the horseshoe dynamics .",
    "in the case in which accretion is allowed , the flow topology in the planet vicinity is more complex than in a non - accreting case , with an impact on the horseshoe zone and on the coorbital corotation torque value . in order to retain only the physics relevant to the effect we are interested in",
    ", we discard gas accretion onto the planet .",
    "it should however be kept in mind that this is not realistic for planet masses @xmath32 .",
    "nonetheless , the phenomenon we describe does persist , and indeed was originally observed , when planetary cores are allowed to accrete .    in our runs the disk surface density is initially axisymmetric and has a power - law profile : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the radius at which the surface density is @xmath35 .",
    "the kinematic viscosity has a uniform value over the disk .",
    "we have adopted a reference set up which closely resembles the one of  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "its characteristics are listed in table  [ tab : reference ] .",
    "whenever we vary one disk parameter ( e.g. aspect ratio or viscosity ) , we adopt for the other parameters the reference values . for a given set of disk parameters ,",

    "the vertical extent of the disk comprises at least @xmath49 pressure scale - heights .",
    "outgoing - wave ( or non - reflecting ) boundary conditions are used at the inner radial border @xcite . in order to exploit the mirror symmetry of the problem with respect to the disk equatorial plane ( the disk and the planet orbit are coplanar ) , a symmetry boundary condition was used at the disk mid - plane , which enables us to simulate only the upper half of the disk . finally , reflecting boundary conditions were used at the outer radial border , which is located sufficiently far from the orbit so that the wake reflection will not alter our torque evaluation , and at @xmath50",
    ", were the matter is so rarefied that the choice of the boundary condition has virtually no impact on the flow properties on the bulk of the disk .",
    "the reference frame has its origin on the center of mass of the star - planet system and corotates with the planet .",

    "shorter runs ( @xmath64 orbits ) were used to monitor ( partially ) unsaturated corotation torques . in 3d calculations , torques arising from the roche lobe are not very sensitive to the choice of the softening parameter , @xmath31 , in the planet gravitational potential , as long as it is a small fraction of the hill radius @xmath65 .",
    "we used @xmath66 .",

    "the value of @xmath35 is @xmath71 .",
    "the potential softening length is @xmath72 .",
    "this value is quite low .",
    "preliminary calculations have shown that the offset is much larger at small potential softening length value , which is why we adopted this value . for a given set of disk parameters",
    ", we performed 35 calculations with 35 different planet masses , in geometric sequence and ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath73 : @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "most of the calculations are run for 100 orbits , in order for the coorbital corotation torque to saturate if the disk parameters imply its saturation .",
    "we have also performed series of short runs for 10 orbits , in order to have an unsaturated corotation torque .",
    "* in the 3d runs , the gravitational torques acting on the planet are evaluated either every @xmath9 orbits ( long - run simulations ) or every orbit ( short - run simulations ) . in the first case , the total torque is averaged over the last @xmath76 orbital periods of the calculation whereas , in the second case , it is averaged from @xmath77 and @xmath78 orbits . as mentioned in section  [ sec :",
    "setup ] , accretion onto the planetary core is not allowed . in the low mass limit",
    ", this leads to the formation of a gas envelope around the planet .",
    "the size of the envelope depends on the core mass and is a fraction of @xmath79 . to avoid the envelope region , torque contributions from within the hill sphere",
    "were discarded .",
    "this choice may occasionally result in some corotation torques being unaccounted for .",
    "when this happens , the departure from the linear regime may be underestimated .",
    "however , tests performed by excluding torques from a region of radius @xmath80 indicate that the effects would not significantly change the results of this study .",
    "therefore , this choice is conservative since it may occasionally underestimate the excess of coorbital corotation torques but assures that our analysis is not affected by spurious torques from material possibly bound to the core . * in fargo , the torque exerted by the disk onto the planet is evaluated every @xmath81 of orbit . in",
    "the long runs case ( @xmath82 orbits ) , the torque value is averaged from @xmath83 to @xmath84  orbits , in order to discard any transient behavior at the beginning of the calculation , due to corotation torque ( possibly partial ) saturation on the libration timescale . in the short runs case , we generally take ( unless otherwise stated ) the torque average between @xmath85 and @xmath77  orbits .",
    "we also entertained the issue whether the roche lobe material must be taken into account .",
    "the fargo code , in its standard version , outputs both the torque exerted by the totality of the disk onto the planet , without a special treatment of the roche lobe material , and the torque obtained by tapering the torque arising from the roche lobe and its surroundings by @xmath86 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the zone center distance to the planet .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : properties ] that taking or not the roche lobe content into account does make a difference , but that qualitatively one obtains the offset properties in both cases .",
    "we have chosen to include the roche lobe content in the torque evaluation for the fargo calculations presented in this work .",
    "there is another reason for this choice , namely that the material that should be discarded in the torque calculation should be the one pertaining to the circumplanetary disk : one would define the system of interest as \\{the planet + the circumplanetary disk}. if the circumplanetary disk has a radius that scales with @xmath87 and that amounts to several @xmath88 for large planet masses , this is not true for the small planet masses that represent most of the mass interval over which we perform the calculations . for these small masses ,",
    "the circumplanetary disk has a radius much smaller than a few @xmath88 , or may not even exist , as we shall see in section  [ sec : bernou ] .",
    "[ fig : ref2d3d ] shows the results of the reference run , corresponding to the parameters of table  [ tab : reference ] , both with and without roche lobe tapering . both curves show the offset near @xmath89 .",
    "however the curves do not coincide , and the offsets have slightly different shapes , which indicates that it is due to material located inside of the hill sphere or in its immediate vicinity .    as mentioned in the introduction , previous two - dimensional simulations by @xcite",
    "have apparently missed the offset feature shown in figure  [ fig : ref2d3d ] .",
    "the most likely reason why this happened is the use of an extremely small softening parameters ( on the order of @xmath90 ) , associated with the action of torques deep inside the planet s hill sphere ( at distances from the planet @xmath91 ) .",
    "we shall see in section  [ sec : bernou ] that for such a small softening length we should expect the offset feature to peak at @xmath92 , which is not in the mass range covered by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their analysis is complicated by the inclusion of accretion and the presence of a gap or dip in the initial surface density profile .",
    "we also performed a set of calculations with nirvana in 2d mode , using the reference parameters and adopting a setup similar to that of fargo .",
    "the resulting specific torque versus the planetary mass is consistent with the solid line with diamonds in figure  [ fig : ref2d3d ] .      the behavior of the total specific torque exerted by the planet on a three - dimensional disk , for the parameters given in table  [ tab : reference ] ,",
    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ref2d3d ] .",
    "the departure from the total torque predicted by the linear theory is largest at @xmath93 .",
    "a comparison between figure  [ fig : ref2d3d ] and figure  6 in @xcite allows to evaluate the impact of core accretion on the excess of corotation torques .",
    "this represents an important issue since around @xmath94 the runaway gas accretion phase is most likely to occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accretion on the planet seems to enhance the excess of coorbital corotation torques , over the predictions based on the linear regime , since it affects the width of the horseshoe region .",
    "the location where the offset is maximal recedes from @xmath93 , when cores are non - accreting , to @xmath95 , when cores accrete at maximum rate .",
    "[ fig : depbetafargo]a shows the results of a set of calculations with four different disks , having different surface density slopes .",

    "] of the torque .",
    "it reaches unity when the total torque cancels out , and exceeds one when migration is reversed . from fig .",

    "the departure from the linearly predicted value is larger for larger vortensity slopes .",
    "although the flat surface vortensity profile ( @xmath96 ) does not have a vanishing @xmath104 , it is nevertheless the profile that exhibits the smallest departure to linear prediction ( by at most 10  % up to @xmath107 ) .",
    "the dashed and dotted line show the curve of @xmath108 for the flat surface density profile ( maximal vortensity slope ) respectively scaled by @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "these curves show that the departure to linearity approximately scales with the vortensity slope .",

    "the behavior of the quantity @xmath111 is illustrated in right panel for the same models .",
    "as observed in the 2d results , the departure from the linear ( type  i ) regime , increases with increasing vortensity gradient .",
    "the previous section suggests that the offset is linked to the coorbital corotation torque , since it scales with the vortensity gradient across the orbit . for the vortensity slopes considered ,",
    "the coorbital corotation torque acting on the planet is positive .",
    "note that as the offset corresponds to a positive value added to the linearly expected torque value , this would suggest that the offset corresponds to a corotation torque larger than predicted by the linear analysis .",
    "if the offset is indeed due to the corotation torque , then it should depend on the disk viscosity , since the corotation torque depends on it @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken additional sets of calculations , in which we take the reference values of table  [ tab : reference ] , except that we vary the disk viscosity  @xmath40 .",
    "we have taken twice the viscosity reference value ( @xmath112 ) , and half the reference value ( @xmath113 ) .",

    "the trend observed on this figure is compatible with the saturation properties of the corotation torque .",
    "the largest offset is observed for the early torque value , i.e. the unsaturated one , while as the viscosity decreases the departure from linearity decreases as well .",
    "quantitatively , the behavior observed is also in agreement with a corotation torque saturation .",
    "the latter depends on the ratio of the libration timescale in the horseshoe region and the viscous timescale across it @xcite .",
    "we can for instance evaluate how saturated the corotation torque should be for @xmath89 .",
    "the horseshoe zone half width @xmath114 for such planet mass in a disk with @xmath115 can be estimated by equating the linear estimate of the coorbital corotation torque @xcite and the horseshoe drag @xcite .",

    ", one can infer that the coorbital corotation torque should be about @xmath123  % of its unsaturated value for the smaller viscosity calculation , @xmath124  % for the reference calculation , and @xmath125  % for the larger viscosity calculation .",
    "the scatter of the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : fargoviscdep]b is roughly compatible with these expectations .",
    "we note in passing that ( i ) this estimate is only an order of magnitude estimate , since we inferred the value of @xmath114 from linear calculations , whereas we suspect the offset to be due to a corotation torque value that differs from the linear estimate and ( ii ) it is by chance that the reference calculation , which takes the parameters of @xcite and @xcite , corresponds precisely to a corotation torque that is half saturated , so that varying slightly the viscosity with respect to the reference one yields a strong variation of the offset amplitude .",
    "we finally note that the saturation of the corotation torque depends on the planet mass , for a fixed viscosity .",
    "the smaller the planet mass , the less saturated is the corotation torque .",
    "we observe this behavior in fig .",

    "we have not investigated further this behavior , which we believe to be of minor importance for the work presented here .",
    "nevertheless , we suggest that it is linked to a drop of the coorbital corotation observed by @xcite , when the viscosity is larger than the so - called cut - off viscosity , which corresponds to the viscosity for which the time needed by a fluid element to drift from the separatrix to the corotation is also half the libration time of this fluid element .",

    "for the reference calculation , we have @xmath131 , while we get twice and half this value for the higher and lower viscosity runs , respectively .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : fargoviscdep]a are roughly compatible with these expectations , although around @xmath132 it is difficult to disentangle this effect from the onset of the departure from linearity of the torque .",
    "as explained above , torques evaluated at early times contain coorbital corotation torques that are unsaturated and thus their effect is the strongest . at later evolutionary times",
    ", the effects of corotation torques may tend to weaken .",
    "figure  [ fig:3dviscdep ] illustrates the behavior of saturation on the total specific torque , as a function of the planet mass , obtained from calculations with a flat initial surface density ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the asterisks represent torques measured around @xmath82 orbits , when corotation torques are partially saturated whereas diamonds refer to torques measured between @xmath134 and @xmath64 orbits , before saturation occurs .",
    "the offset reduces as corotation torques saturate .",
    "the planet mass for which the offset is maximum shifts towards larger values and the range of masses in which the total torque is positive shrinks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dviscdep ] ) .",
    "however , a finite mass interval persists in which the departure from the linear regime can still be very large .",
    "the two previous sections strongly suggest that the offset is indeed a physical effect , independent on the code used , and that it is linked to an excess of the coorbital corotation torque with respect to its linearly estimated value .",
    "this therefore implies that the offset corresponds to the onset of non - linear effects in the flow .",
    "the flow non - linearity depends on the parameter @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the onset of this behavior should therefore be observed for a planet to primary mass ratio @xmath136 .",

    "the latter reads @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the fluid specific enthalpy of the unperturbed flow , which is a uniform quantity as the disk has initially a uniform sound speed and a uniform surface density , and where @xmath204 is the perturbation of the specific enthalpy introduced by the planet .",
    "similarly , the gravitational potential can be written as @xmath205 , where @xmath206 , the gravitational potential of the central star , corresponds to the unperturbed flow and where @xmath29 , the gravitational potential of the planet , corresponds to the perturbation .",
    "hence the effective potential can be decomposed as @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is its value in the unperturbed flow while @xmath209 is its perturbed value .",
    "figure  [ fig : enthalpy ] shows that the two quantities @xmath29 and @xmath210 are of the same order of magnitude and of opposite sign in the planet vicinity , so that the perturbed effective potential reduces to a tiny fraction of the absolute value of either quantity .",
    "a condition for the flow linearity is that @xmath211 , which therefore translates into @xmath212 , or , at the planet location , into : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the planet s bondi radius .",

    "the departure from linearity therefore occurs at lower mass in the smaller softening length case .    assuming that the horseshoe zone separatrix does not intersect any shock ( a reasonable assumption for small mass planets )",

    "we can understand the boost of the horseshoe region width in the transition region as follows :    * as long as the flow remains linear , the stagnation point is located at a fixed position far from the planet .",
    "it therefore samples a value of the perturbed bernoulli constant that simply scales with @xmath100 , hence the horseshoe zone width scales with @xmath170 . * when @xmath222 , the stagnation point begins to move towards the planet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diffbondi ] ) , which implies that @xmath223 is no longer a constant but increases with @xmath100 , as the stagnation point goes deeper into the effective potential well of the planet . as a consequence",
    "the horseshoe zone width increases faster than @xmath170 in this regime .",
    "the above discussion is valid for a 2d situation with a finite potential softening length . under these circumstances , the dimensionless parameter that controls the flow linearity is @xmath224 . in a three dimensional case with a point - like mass",
    ", we can gain some insight on the condition for the flow linearity assuming a horizontal , layered motion for each slice of disk material .",
    "although we know that this is not strictly the case @xcite , it is nevertheless a useful approximation that relates the three dimensional case to the above discussion . in each slice ,",
    "the planet potential is the one of a 2d situation with a potential softening length @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is the slice altitude .",
    "therefore , if over most of the disk s vertical extent , the flow is linear ( that is , if over most of the disk s vertical extent , @xmath227 , which amounts to the condition @xmath228 ) then most of the torque acting on the planet arises from slices which contribute linearly to the torque , hence the total torque nearly amounts to its linearly estimated value , whereas if the bondi radius amounts to a significant fraction of the disk s vertical extent , the layers with altitude @xmath229 have an excess of horseshoe zone width and contribute significantly to the total torque value , which therefore has a significant offset w.r.t the linear estimate .",
    "the condition for the appearance of the offset in a 3d case is therefore @xmath230 , which also reads @xmath231 , or using , the notation of @xcite , @xmath232 .",
    "this is consistent with the dimensional analysis of @xcite and with our findings of section  [ sec : depthick ] .",
    "we make the following comments :    * although the bondi sphere and the hill sphere have different expression and scaling with the planet mass , they happen to coincide with the disk thickness at roughly the same planet mass ( within a factor of @xmath49 ) , so that characterizing the flow non - linearity by comparing the hill radius to the disk thickness also amounts to comparing the bondi radius to the disk thickness .",
    "* although we probably do not have a sufficient resolution to properly characterize the flow within the bondi radius ( when the softening length is shorter than this radius ) , it seems that there is no trapped region of material librating about the planet within this radius .",
    "indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowtopo]b or c , we see that the unique stagnation point , within the bondi radius , splits the disk material in its vicinity into four regions : the inner and outer disk , and the two ends of the horseshoe region .",
    "this may have important consequences for the numerical simulations of embedded planets in non self - gravitating disks : in such disks , a common ( and still debated ) practice consists in truncating the torque summation so as to reject the contributions from the circumplanetary material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is considered to form , together with the planet , a relevant system that migrates as a whole , and the migration of which is accounted for by the _",
    "forces applied ( hence the truncation ) . in the case of embedded small mass planets however , should it be confirmed that no trapped circumplanetary material exists in the planet vicinity , then no torque truncation should be performed when evaluating the torque . *",
    "the offset displays a remarkable amplitude in 3d calculations , not even reproduced with the relatively small softening length that we adopted in our 2d calculations ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is the vertical motion of the disk material in the planet vicinity described by @xcite , which results in a bent of the horseshoe streamlines towards the planet . as a result ,",
    "the stagnation point associated to the horseshoe separatrix with altitude @xmath226 far away from the planet has an altitude @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , this stagnation point is closer to the planet than it would be in a sliced horizontal motion approximation , hence the perturbed bernoulli constant at that point is larger than given by the horizontal motion approximation , and the associated horseshoe separatrix is wider , yielding a larger contribution to the coorbital corotation torque .",

    ", some amount of disk viscosity should therefore be able to prevent the corotation torque saturation .",
    "an estimate of the minimum viscosity required to prevent the torque saturation can be determined as follows : the saturation results from the libration , which tends to flatten out the vortensity profile across the horseshoe region ( in an inviscid 2d flow , the vortensity is conserved along a fluid element path ) , while viscous diffusion tends to restore the large scale vortensity gradient , if any .",

    "the molecular viscosity of the gas is however orders of magnitude too low to account for such values of @xmath38 .",
    "it is generally admitted that a large fraction of a protoplanetary disk is subject to the magnetorotational instability or mri @xcite , the non - linear outcome of which is a turbulent state which endows the disk with an effective kinematic viscosity of the order of magnitude of the viscosity needed to account for the mass accretion rate inferred from observations of t tauri disks . in such disks , however , the torque exerted by the gas on an embedded protoplanet displays large temporal fluctuations that tend to yield a random walk of the planet semi - major axis , rather than a steady drift of the latter @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that even for planet masses of the order of @xmath270  @xmath271 ( in a disk with @xmath251 , with no vertical stratification ) , the random fluctuations of the semi - major axis overcome the effects of type  i migration on timescales of the order of @xmath272  orbits , while @xcite argue that such diffusive migration systematically lowers the planet lifetimes , even if it allows a small fraction of protoplanets to `` survive '' migration over the disk lifetime . in mhd",
    "turbulent disks , the stochastic nature of the turbulent viscosity , although largely sufficient to maintain the corotation torque unsaturated , would certainly hide the effect that we describe in this work , at least over @xmath272 orbits .",
    "should the random fluctuations average out over longer timescales , so that a systematic drift could be reliably measured , the effect of migration slow down of sub - critical solid cores should become noticeable .",
    "there are other situations , yet numerically unexplored , in which the disk s turbulent state could prevent the corotation torque saturation and yet be sufficiently mild that the planet would undergo a systematic rather than stochastic migration",
    ". this could be the case of the so - called dead zone , a region of the disk where the gas ionization fraction is too low to allow the coupling of the gas to the magnetic field and where the mri does not occur .",
    "the disk upper layers above a dead zone are sufficiently ionized by external irradiation of cosmic rays or high - energy photons to be subject to the mri and therefore to be turbulent @xcite .",
    "this turbulence generates velocity fluctuations at the disk midplane , within the dead zone , which is therefore not completely `` dead '' and has an @xmath38 value several times smaller than that of the active layers @xcite .",
    "it is likely that within the dead zone , the torque convergence is reached , over a given timescale , at a smaller planet mass than in an mhd turbulent disk , which suggests that sub - critical solid cores could undergo a steady migration , significantly slowed down , or reversed , within the dead zone .",
    "it is also possible that weaker forms of turbulence may exist that are still able to prevent the corotation torque saturation , such as the hydrodynamics turbulence triggered by the global baroclinic instability @xcite .",
    "however , the turbulence resulting from the kelvin helmholtz instability due to the gas vertical shear arising from the dust sedimentation @xcite seems to be too weak to desaturate the corotation torque for planet masses larger than @xmath273 , as it yields an @xmath38-value of the order of @xmath150 .",
    "we close this section with the following comment : all what is needed to avoid the corotation torque saturation is to bring `` fresh '' vortensity from the inner or outer disk to the horseshoe region in less than a libration timescale . the standard approach based upon",
    "the comparison of the libration and viscous timescales across the horseshoe region is certainly correct when the largest turbulent scale is smaller than the horseshoe zone width , so that the vortensity enters the horseshoe region in a diffusive manner , but it is unlikely to be adequate when the turbulence scale is larger than the horseshoe region width . in this case , which occurs among others in the case of the mhd turbulence ,",
    "one rather has to compare the libration timescale to the advection timescale across the horseshoe region at the average turbulent speed .",
    "this plays in favor of desaturation , and seems to imply that preventing the corotation torque saturation is much easier than suggested by the libration / viscous diffusion timescales comparison .",
    "by means of two and three dimensional calculations we have found the following :    1 .   there is a boost of the coorbital corotation torque for sub - critical solid cores ( @xmath2 ) in thin ( @xmath3 ) protoplanetary disks . in disks with shallow surface density profiles ,",
    "i.e. @xmath274 with @xmath275 , this yields a _ positive _ excess of the corotation torque that leads to a slowing down or reversal of the migration .",

    "the migration of a planet of given mass would stop , in a flaring disk , at a distance from the central object that depends on the planet mass .",
    "conversely , if an accreting protoplanet , in a flaring disk , reaches a point where the tidal torque cancels out , it starts to recede from the central object at a rate dictated by its mass growth rate .",
    "this effect has been unnoticed thus far in 2d calculations probably owing to the large softening length adopted or to strong torques arising from within the roche lobe of accreting planets .",
    "poor mass sampling may have also played a role . 7 .",
    "small mass planets do not have a roche lobe ( i.e. a prograde circumplanetary disk extending over a fraction of the hill radius ) .",
    "they have a bondi sphere , that is smaller than their roche lobe .",
    "there is presently an issue about the torque evaluation in calculations with non self - gravitating disks . in these calculations",
    ", it is still debated whether one must include the roche lobe content @xcite or not @xcite in the sum of the elementary contributions to the torque of the disk material .",
    "regardless of the correct answer to this question , numericists who truncate the torque summation in the planet vicinity should be aware that the sum should only exclude at most the ( small ) bondi sphere rather than the roche lobe when simulating deeply embedded ( @xmath281 ) protoplanets .",
    "8 .   in 2d calculations , the dimensionless parameter that determines the flow linearity in the planet vicinity is @xmath282 .",
    "if @xmath283 ( a prescription that we chose for the 2d runs presented in this work ) or @xmath284 , this dimensionless parameters scales as a function of @xmath285 and the flow non - linearities in such 2d calculations also appear for mass ratios @xmath136 .      1 .",
    "the flow transition exhibited in this work could be studied in the simplified framework of the shearing sheet approximation .",
    "then the asymmetry between the left and right stagnation points ( which we believe to be a feature of minor importance , despite its robustness ) would disappear , and they would lie on the same separatrix .",
    "this study could be undertaken using the method of @xcite .",
    "a quantitative study of the flow transitions ( planet mass for which the left and right stagnation points coalesce , and planet mass for which a roche lobe appears ) would provide a very valuable insight on the dynamics of the flow in the planet vicinity .",
    "although we have seen that in the low mass case ( deeply embedded core , or @xmath286 ) the flow non - linearities are confined to the bondi sphere , we do not have undertaken a study of the flow within this sphere . characterizing this flow , possibly by means of very high ( nested grid ) numerical simulations , would be of great interest .",
    "the role of accretion has been neglected in the present analysis , while the mass range for which the offset is observed , depending on the disk thickness , may involve accreting cores .",
    "it seems that accretion enhances the offset @xcite , but a quantitative analysis of its impact remains to be done .",
    "we have emphasized the role played by dissipation , which must be present to prevent the corotation torque saturation .",
    "as the present study deals with small mass planets , it should be relatively easy to prevent this saturation .",
    "so far the only self consistent calculations of a turbulent disk with embedded planets deal with a fully turbulent disk subject to the mri . a study characterizing",
    "the ability of other forms of turbulence ( such as the global baroclinic instability , or the residual turbulence of the dead zone in a layered accretion disk ) to desaturate the corotation torque of small mass planets would be very valuable .",
    "the computations with nirvana reported in this paper were performed using the uk astrophysical fluids facility ( ukaff ) .",
    "the computations with fargo were performed at the centre de calcul de lin2p3 .",

    "<S> the increase of computational resources has recently allowed high resolution , three dimensional calculations of planets embedded in gaseous protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> they provide estimates of the planet migration timescale that can be compared to analytical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> while these predictions can result in extremely short migration timescales for cores of a few earth masses , recent numerical calculations have given an unexpected outcome : the torque acting on planets with masses between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is considerably smaller than the analytic , linear estimate . </S>",
    "<S> these findings motivated the present work , which investigates existence and origin of this discrepancy or `` offset '' , as we shall call it , by means of two and three dimensional numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the offset is indeed physical and arises from the coorbital corotation torque , since ( i ) it scales with the disk vortensity gradient , ( ii ) its asymptotic value depends on the disk viscosity , ( iii ) it is associated to an excess of the horseshoe zone width . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the offset corresponds to the onset of non - linearities of the flow around the planet , which alter the streamline topology as the planet mass increases : at low mass the flow non - linearities are confined to the planet s bondi sphere whereas at larger mass the streamlines display a classical picture reminiscent of the restricted three body problem , with a prograde circumplanetary disk inside a `` roche lobe '' . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is of particular importance for the sub - critical solid cores ( @xmath2 ) in thin ( @xmath3 ) protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> their migration could be significantly slowed down , or reversed , in disks with shallow surface density profiles . </S>"
