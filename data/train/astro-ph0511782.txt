    "recent observations @xcite suggested that intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) exist in some starburst galaxies . the first such object , m82 x-1 ( the brightest source in figure 1 of @xcite ) lays 200pc off the dynamical center of m82 , and has the estimated minimum mass of 700 @xmath1 .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed for the formation of this object @xcite .",
    "both ebisuzaki et al . and miller and hamilton argued that imbhs are formed through stellar dynamical process and merging .",
    "the main difference between them is simply in the time at which the merging occurs .",
    "ebisuzaki et al .",
    "assumed that most of merging process occurred while participants were main - sequence stars . on the other hand , miller and hamilton assumed that the imbh grew through merging of smaller black holes .",
    "which of the two processes actually occur depends mainly on the initial thermal relaxation time of the cluster .",
    "@xcite showed , using @xmath0-body simulations , that the runaway merging of massive star occurs if the initial relaxation time of the star cluster is less than 4 myrs , which is of the order of the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "the compact star cluster mgg-11 @xcite , which coincides with the location of m82 x-1 , has the estimated relaxation time of 3 myrs . on the other hand",
    ", the relaxation time of mgg9 , which is more massive than mgg11 , is significantly longer .",
    "this difference is consistent with the existence and nonexistence of imbhs in mgg-11 and 9 , respectively . in the case of the scenario by miller and hamilton",
    ", the growth timescale would be much longer , and it is hard to explain why any imbh can exist in a young cluster like mgg-11 .    compared to the relaxation time of typical globular clusters , which is @xmath2 yrs , the relaxation time of a few myrs might sounds extremely short .",
    "however , for young clusters , such short relaxation time is not unusual .",
    "for example , arches and quintuplet clusters , whose estimated ages are around 1 - 5 myrs years , have the estimated relaxation time of 12 m years @xcite .",
    "star clusters r136 in lmc and westerlund 1 in our galaxy are other examples of such young compact clusters .",
    "if the formation of imbhs is not a rare event in young and compact clusters , two questions naturally arise . what is the final fate of the imbh and its parent cluster , and whether or not it is related to the growth of the central black hole of the parent galaxy .",
    "the star cluster itself evolves through internal thermal relaxation , tidal truncation , and dynamical friction , much in the same way as globular clusters evolve .",
    "the main difference is again that the timescale is much shorter .",
    "for example , if there is a cluster with mass @xmath3 at the distance of 30 pc from the center of our galaxy , the dynamical friction timescale would be @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a velocity dispersion and @xmath6 is the mass of the cluster .",
    "as the cluster sinks toward the center of the parent galaxy , the tidal field of the galaxy becomes stronger . as a result ,",
    "the cluster loses mass , and eventually becomes completely disrupted , leaving the imbh orbiting around the central smbh .",
    "irs13e @xcite looks like such a remnant cluster , composed of a single imbh and several stars still bound to it @xcite irs13e is located at 4 arcsec ( @xmath70.16pc ) from sgr a@xmath8 .",
    "it appears as a cluster of seven individual stars within a projected diameter of @xmath7 0.5 arcsec ( 0.02 pc ) .",
    "all these sources have a common westward proper motion , indicating that they are bound ( at least six of them ) .",
    "the types of stars imply that it is a young star cluster with the age of a few myrs . to keep these stars bound",
    ", the total gravitational mass of irs13e must exceed @xmath9 , about one order of magnitude larger than the estimated total mass of visible stars .",
    "one natural interpretation is that irs13e is a remaining core of much more massive star cluster , with an imbh of @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the orbital evolution of an imbh after its parent cluster is completely disrupted .",
    "the main question is the merging timescale of the imbh and the central smbh . in the case of a massive bh binary , which forms when",
    "two galaxies each with a central massive bh merge , the merging timescale has been the area of active research since the pioneering work by @xcite . in this case",
    ", the result of recent large - scale @xmath0-body simulations @xcite suggests that the merging timescale is much longer than the hubble time .",
    "they demonstrated that the evolution timescale of the bh binary is proportional to the relaxation time of the parent galaxy , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is different from the results of previous simulations @xcite , but the difference is mostly due to the limitation in the number of particles in previous simulations . @xcite and @xcite obtained similar results as @xcite , albeit with somewhat smaller number of particles .",
    "however , we can not directly apply these result to the case of an smbh - imbh binary , because of its very large mass ratio . in the case of smbh - smbh binary ,",
    "the binary need to interact with the field stars with the total mass comparable to that of the total mass of the binary to change its internal orbital parameters significantly .",
    "thus , the loss - cone depletion occurs when the binary ejected out the mass comparable to its mass , and the structure outside the loss cone region is self - gravitating . in the case of smbh - imbh binary ,",
    "the imbh orbit can evolve by interacting with the mass comparable to the imbh mass which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the smbh mass .",
    "thus , loss cone depletion can occur when the imbh ejected out the central stellar mass comparable to the imbh mass , and the gravitational potential of this region , or actually of the region much further out , is dominated by the potential of the central bh .",
    "thus , unlike the case of smbh - smbh binary , we need to study the evolution of a highly unequal mass binary , in the distribution of stars which are all bound to the primary component of the binary .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe the numerical method and the initial conditions we used . in  3 and",
    " 4 , we describe the result of the simulations .",
    "summary and discussion are presented in  5 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the orbital evolution of an imbh in the stellar distribution where the gravitational potential of the central smbh dominates . as the background stellar distribution",
    ", we adopt the standard @xmath11 cusp @xcite . one practical problem with this distribution",
    "is that the total mass would be infinity if the density profile is given by this single power law .",
    "in addition , such a model is physically unacceptable , since the basic assumption for the bahcall - wolf cusp is that the gravitational potential is dominated by that of the central bh .    in order to construct a model with central density slope of @xmath12 and finite mass ,",
    "we use tremaine s @xmath13-model with central bh @xcite , with one modification .",
    "the original @xmath13-model has the outer slope of @xmath14 .",
    "we constructed the model with outer slope of @xmath15 , just to make the mass in the outer region smaller .",
    "the density distribution of our modified model is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total mass of field stars and @xmath18 is the scale length . the model with @xmath19",
    "correspond to profile @xmath11 , and we use it in this paper .    in order to construct an @xmath0-body model in dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "we need to construct the distribution function ( df ) .",
    "we could obtain df at least numerically by solving the abel integral equation .",
    "however , since what we need is a model with an inner power - law cusp and some outer cutoff , it would be an overkill to obtain a distribution function which exactly satisfies equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "so we approximate df by the following formula .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24    df of this form gives a correct asymptotic behavior for both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this formula has one adjustable parameter @xmath27 .",
    "we chose @xmath28 after some numerical tests .",
    "we generated the initial @xmath0-body model in the following two steps .",
    "first , we generate positions of @xmath0 particles so that the density distribution obeys equation ( [ eq : rho ] )",
    ". then we assign the velocity to each particle , so that the velocity distribution at the point of particle is consistent with the df given in equation ( [ eq : f - e ] ) .",
    "since the df we used is an approximate solution , the constructed @xmath0-body model is not in an exact dynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , as we will see in  [ sec : stability ] , our initial model is in pretty good dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we chose the system of units in which the total mass of the system and gravitational constant are both unity and the total binding energy of the system is @xmath29 .",
    "we set the mass of smbh to be @xmath30 , that of the imbh @xmath31 .",
    "the mass of the stellar distribution is therefore @xmath32 .",
    "the stellar mass inside the radius @xmath33 is @xmath34 for the above choice of the system of units , @xmath35 .",
    "when constructing the initial stellar distribution , we exclude the stars with periastron distance less than @xmath36 , to avoid numerical problem .    to convert the timescale obtained in our simulations to the physical timescale , we need to define conversions between our system of units and real physical units .",
    "we use unit mass @xmath37 , unit length @xmath38pc , resulting in the unit time of @xmath39yrs .",
    "mass and length units are chosen so that the stellar mass inside the radius 0.7pc ( assuming that the single power law with @xmath12 slope continues to that radius ) is @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : genzel ] shows the mass distribution for our model ( assuming single power - law density ) , the model by @xcite , and observational data .",
    "note that our model is within the observational error bars and practically indistinguishable with the model by @xcite .",
    "the imbh particle is placed in a circular orbit at the radius 0.1 ( 0.086pc in physical units ) .",
    "its mass is @xmath41 .",
    "we performed four runs with different number of field particles ( models a1 to a4 of table 1 ) .",
    "the mass of a field particle in model a4 is 30 @xmath42 , which is not too far from the mass of real stars ( whatever they are ) in this region .    in table 1 ,",
    "models b1 to b4 were prepared to study the evolution of the imbh after it approaches to less than 0.01 pc to the smbh . for these models",
    ", we used @xmath43 much smaller than that is used for model ax , to reduce the total number of stars .",
    "we used @xmath44 and placed the imbh at @xmath45 , so that the stellar distribution at the initial position of imbh is still the power law with slope @xmath12 .",
    "the total stellar mass is @xmath46 , or about 20 times the imbh mass .",
    "results of bx models will be discussed in  4 .",
    "mass of a field particle in model b4 is 3 @xmath42 , which is of the same order with that of real stars in this region .",
    "thus , two - body relaxation effect in this model is essentially the same as what would occur in the real galactic center .",
    "we made models c1 and c2 to test the effect of softening parameters ( see in  [ sec : hardware ] ) and d1 and d2 to test the validity of the initial model and relaxation effect ( see  [ sec : stability ] ) .",
    "for all calculations , we used simple direct - summation algorithm and fourth - order hermite scheme integrator with individual ( block ) time step @xcite .    for the calculation of gravitational forces from field particles ( to both the field particle and black holes )",
    ", we used the grape-6 ( and -6a ) of tokyo university , a special purpose computer for @xmath47body simulation @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the forces from black holes was done on the host computer to maintain sufficient accuracy .",
    "we did not include any relativistic effects and treated bh particle as massive newtonian particle .    in our calculation , we did not use regularization technique to keep the calculation code simple .",
    "thus , we need to apply softening parameters for gravitational interactions between particles .",
    "we use four different softening lengths , for bh - bh , smbh - star , imbh - star , and star - star interactions .    for smbh - imbh interaction , we apply zero softening .",
    "they can not easily come close enough to each other for the numerical difficulty to occur .",
    "if such close encounter occurs , the timescale of orbital evolution through gravitational wave radiation becomes short enough so that our pure newtonian treatment is not really valid .",
    "the softening for bh - star interaction should be determined with some care , since close encounters do occur and too large softening can affect the orbital evolution of the imbh . for the softening of smbh - star interaction , we used @xmath48 and @xmath49 in ax and bx runs , respectively .",
    "these values are chosen so that the effect of softening is small enough for stars at the radius comparable to that of the imbh .    for imbh - star interaction , we chose the softening so that it is smaller than 90-degree turnaround distance by at least two orders of magnitude at the initial condition .",
    "as the imbh approaches to smbh , the velocity dispersion becomes larger , the difference between the softening length and the 90-degree turnaround distance becomes smaller , but it was always kept significantly larger than 1 .",

    "the softening should be small enough not to affect the distribution of stars .",

    "in addition , the system would evolve through two - body relaxation even if the initial model is in exact dynamical equilibrium . to see these effects , we performed two test calculations ( models d1 and d2 ) , where we let the system without the imbh to evolve for 1000 time units",

    "we can see that the density profiles are practically unchanged , and that lagrangian radii do not show any systematic evolution .      as we discussed in  2.2 , the choice of softening for star - star interaction might have some unpredictable effect on the evolution of the orbit of the imbh . to see if there is any such effect , we performed two runs , models c1 and c2 , which started from the same initial condition as model a4 but with different values of @xmath55 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : diff - epsiron ] .",
    "there is no systematic difference among these three runs .",

    "the semi - major axis of the imbh is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the binding energy of the imbh @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the relative velocity of the two bhs and @xmath65 is the reduced mass defined as @xmath66    from figure [ fig:1st - a ] , we can see that the orbital evolution of the imbh is practically independent of the number of stars in the parent galaxy . in all models ,",
    "the imbh is much more massive than the field stars .",
    "so this result is not surprising .",
    "the thin solid curve of in figure [ fig:1st - a ] is the theoretical prediction for the evolution of the imbh orbit , obtained using standard dynamical friction formula @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 here @xmath5 is the velocity dispersion and we used the circular velocity @xmath70 as the velocity of the imbh .",
    "we used @xmath71 here . for the calculation of dynamical friction in inhomogeneous background distribution",
    ", it has been suggested that taking the outer cutoff of coulombs logarithm to the distance of the object from the center of the parent stellar system gives good estimate @xcite .",
    "the lower cutoff is 90-degree turnaround distance , which is given by @xmath72 thus , we have @xmath73 independent of the location of the imbh . using equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) , equation ( [ eq : hardening - rate1 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the stellar mass density at @xmath76 and we assume the circular motion so that we used @xmath77 .",
    "we chose @xmath78 here .",
    "this differential equation has the analytic solution given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 we can see that the agreement between the theoretical prediction and numerical result is pretty good , at least for the early period ( @xmath81 ) . in the later phase",
    ", it seems the numerical results show the slowing down of the evolution .    to see the difference between the theoretical prediction and numerical results more clearly , we calculated the hardening rate @xmath82 , defined as @xmath83 here @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the semi - major axis of the imbh at times @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath89 for all values of @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ fig : hardening - rate ] shows the result .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical prediction and numerical results is fairly good for @xmath91 . for @xmath92 , numerical result gives the hardening rate smaller than the theoretical prediction , and the difference becomes larger as @xmath93 becomes smaller .",
    "a natural explanation of this slowing down is the loss - cone depletion , similar to what happens in the case of massive bh binaries .",
    "figures [ fig:1st - dense ] show the lagrangian radii of field stars .",
    "we used the position of smbh as the coordinate center .",
    "we can see that as the imbh sink toward the center , the lagrangian radius corresponding to the position of the imbh starts to expand .",
    "for example , in the case of model a4 , the radius enclosing the mass of @xmath94 ( fourth curve from the top ) starts to expand at around @xmath95 , which is the time the imbh semi - major axis crosses that radius .",
    "radii enclosing smaller masses show similar tendency , though the expansion is faster for radii with smaller mass .",
    "since the expansion of a lagrangian radius starts when the imbh reaches that radius , we can conclude that this expansion is due to the back reaction of dynamical friction to the imbh .",
    "thus , when the stellar mass inside the imbh semi - major axis becomes comparable to the imbh mass , the effect of back reaction becomes significant .",
    "stellar mass inside @xmath45 is about 0.1% of the total stellar mass , which is about the same as the imbh mass .",
    "thus , when the imbh reaches the radius 0.01 , the effect of the imbh to the stellar distribution becomes significant , and number density of field stars is reduced .",
    "this is the reason why the hardening rate becomes smaller when @xmath93 reaches 0.01 .",
    "figures [ fig:1st - ej ] show the distribution of the field stars in the @xmath96 plane , for run a4 and d2 at @xmath97 and 1000 . here , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the specific binding energy and specific total angular momentum of field stars .",
    "we take the center of mass of smbh - imbh binary as the origin tocalculate @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "note that we excluded field particles with the periastron distance to smbh less than @xmath36 when we constructed the initial condition .",
    "the left - hand - side cutoff in the distribution ( at around @xmath100 ) is due to this exclusion .",
    "when we compare the panels , it is clear that field particles with small @xmath99 ( @xmath101 ) and large negative @xmath98 ( @xmath102 ) are depleted in model a4 , while no such tendency is visible for model d2 ( without imbh ) .",
    "these particles are kicked out to high - energy , low - angular - momentum orbits by interaction with the imbh .",
    "there are many particles in the area @xmath103 and @xmath104 in @xmath105 panel for run a4 , while these are not in model d2 .",
    "it is clear that these particles were kicked out by interaction with the imbh from the small @xmath99 and large negative @xmath98 region .",
    "figures [ fig:1st - jj ] show the initial and final ( @xmath105 ) total angular momentum of stars for runs a4 and d2 . in the case of run a2",
    ", we can see that a fair number of particles which initially have small @xmath99 ( @xmath106 ) got much larger @xmath99 .",
    "it indicates that field particles are kicked out by the imbh .",
    "the dispersion in the case of run d2 is purely due to the two - body relaxation .",
    "figures [ fig:1st - ee ] show the initial and final binding energies of particles for runs a4 and d2 . here",
    ", we can see the scatter is much larger for run a4 .",
    "figure [ fig:1st - e ] shows the time evolution of the imbh - smbh binary eccentricity defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the angular momentum of the binary .    from these results ,",
    "it is not clear if there is any systematic change in @xmath109 or whether or not the evolution depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the fluctuation in @xmath109 is bigger for small-@xmath0 calculation ( a1 and a2 compared to a3 or a4 ) . on the other hand , in run a4 @xmath109",
    "seems to show systematic increase after @xmath110 .",
    "as we can see from figure [ fig:1st - a ] , it may be related to the slowing down of the evolution of the semi - major axis , which is caused by the loss - cone depletion .    in the next section",
    ", we will investigate this evolution of the imbh orbit after the depletion of the loss cone .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the imbh sink toward the smbh through dynamical friction , and its orbital evolution slows down when the imbh reaches the radius total stellar mass inside which is comparable to the imbh mass . in other words",
    ", it occurs after the imbh ejected out the neighboring stars . in this section",
    ", we analyze the evolution of the imbh orbit after it kicked out the neighboring stars . in order to do so",
    ", we performed another set of simulations ( run bx ) , in which we placed the imbh initially at the distance 1/10 of that in runs ax .",
    "also , the stellar distribution is cut off at smaller radius , to reduce the total number of particles .",
    "we performed runs b1 through b4 .",
    "the mass of the field stars in run b1 is the same as that in a4 . in b4 ,",
    "the mass ratio between the imbh and field stars is @xmath111 , and therefore the mass of field stars is around the solar mass .",
    "two - body effects in run b4 is not larger than what would occur in real galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - a ] shows the evolution of semi - major axis .",
    "we can see that the evolution does not depend on the mass of field stars .",
    "this result is not surprising since even for run b1 the initial relaxation time of field particles at the initial location of the imbh is @xmath112 in the time unit and is much longer than the duration of the calculation .",
    "the slowing down is much more pronounced compared to that in runs ax , simply because we followed the evolution of the imbh down to smaller value of @xmath93 .",
    "the evolution of the semi - major axis got stuck by @xmath110 , when the semi - major axis reached @xmath113 .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - energy ] shows the energy error for each of bx runs .",
    "errors are reasonably small before @xmath114 for all runs",
    ". quick increases in error are due to the increase in the eccentricity of the imbh . at @xmath114 ,",
    "the binding energy of the imbh is @xmath115 of the initial total binding energy of the system .",
    "thus , relative energy error of @xmath116 corresponds to the error of the semi - major axis of @xmath117 , which is small compared to the overall change of the semi - major axis .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - dense ] shows the evolution of the lagrangian radii of field particles .",
    "as the imbh sinks toward the smbh , field stars expand .",
    "as the evolution of the imbh slows down , the expansion of field stars also slows down .",
    "it is clear that the expansion , or depletion of the loss cone , is the cause of the slowing down of the imbh orbit evolution .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - dense ] might give the impression that all field stars expand outward . actually , that impression is wrong .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - ee ] shows the initial and final energies of field stars for run b3 .",
    "large fraction of field stars show very small change in the energy , and some particles get very large energy .",
    "this is of course the same as what is visible in figure [ fig:1st - ee ] for run a4 . only the stars which strongly interacted with the imbh",
    "are ejected , and other stars are essentially unaffected .",
    "the apparent expansion of outer lagrangian radii in figure [ fig:2nd - dense ] is the result of the ejection of the inner part of the field stars .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - e ] shows the evolution of eccentricities for runs b1 to b4 . unlike the case of runs ax , here it seems clear that in all runs eccentricity shows slow increase in the early phase ( @xmath118 ) , and in some runs there are phases when @xmath109 approaches to very close to unity .",
    "however , exactly when such phase occurs shows large run - to - run variation .",
    "this quick increase of the eccentricity is rather surprising , since in previous studies of massive bh binaries @xcite such increase has not been observed .",
    "however , since the configuration of the system is quite different , evolution can be very different . in the case of smbh binary ,",
    "two massive binaries have similar mass , and field stars which interact with the binary are not strongly bound to the binary .",
    "however , in our case of smbh - imbh binary , all field stars are strongly bound to the smbh , and have almost keplarian orbits .",
    "thus , celestial - mechanical effects such as the mean - motion resonance and kozai mechanism @xcite can play important roles .",
    "these effects , on average , work as the transport mechanism for angular momentum from rapidly - rotating objects to slowly - rotating objects . in other words , these effects tend to increase the eccentricity of the imbh .    figures [ fig:2nd - l ] show the normalized angular momentum of the imbh , @xmath119 , where @xmath108 is the angular momentum calculated in equation ( [ eq : ecc ] ) and @xmath120 is the angular momentum of the circular orbit with the same semi - major axis .",
    "we can see that the slow increase of the eccentricity directly corresponds to the decrease of the total angular momentum , and the random walk of the angular momentum vector is small , especially for runs with large @xmath0 .",
    "apparently , only after the quick increase of the eccentricity the random walk of the angular momentum vector becomes noticeable .",
    "thus , probably the high eccentricity state corresponds to some statistical equilibrium .",
    "here we try to understand the mechanism which drives the increase of the eccentricity .",
    "we concentrate on run b4 , since it has the largest number of field particles and therefore the statistical analysis of the behavior of field particles is the most reliable . in particular , as we can see in figure [ fig:2nd - l ] , in run b4 the orbital plane of the imbh remains close to the xy - plane , while in other runs the random walk of the angular momentum vector is significant .    in order to understand the behavior of the imbh",
    ", it would be useful to see with which field particles the imbh interacted .",
    "figure [ fig : a - cdl-1 ] shows the cumulative change of angular momentum of field particles as the function of their semi - major axis @xmath93 . here",
    ", the change in the angular momentum @xmath121 of a particle is defined as @xmath122\\cdot \\hat{\\bf l}_{\\rm imbh}~ , \\label{eq : dl_0}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is its angular momentum vector at time @xmath124 , and @xmath125 is the unit vector with the direction of the angular momentum vector of the imbh .",
    "we use @xmath126 for all values of @xmath124 .",
    "thus this @xmath121 is the angular momentum change projected to the orbital plane of the imbh .",
    "figure [ fig : rho2 ] show the change of the density profiles for run b4 .",
    "we can see that the central density decreases , and the inclination of the central cusp becomes flat .",
    "it is caused by the ejection of field stars by the imbh .",
    "the difference between the plot for @xmath97 and @xmath127 is that , even though the semi - major axis of the imbh is much smaller at @xmath127 , the field particles which exchanged the angular momentum has much wider distribution at @xmath127 than at @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath97 , stars with the semi - major axis comparable to that of the imbh dominate the change in the angular momentum , while for @xmath127 , stars with @xmath93 comparable to that of the imbh ( 0.003 ) have practically no contribution , and effect of stars with @xmath128 is not negligible .",
    "of course , since the imbh ejected most of stars with @xmath92 , it can not interact with them .",
    "figure [ fig : r - cdl-1 ] shows the same cumulative plot but as the function of the periastron distance @xmath129 . for @xmath97 , particles which go inside the imbh orbit account for the change in the angular momentum . on the other hand , at @xmath127 particles orbit outside the imbh orbit are responsible for the change in the angular momentum , and that tendency is more significant for field particles with small @xmath93 .    for field stars with relatively small @xmath93 , we can draw the following picture .",
    "the imbh has created the hole in the distribution function , and it can interact only with stars with semi - major axis larger or comparable to its apocenter distance . in other words ,",
    "the imbh can strongly interact with other stars only when it is at the apocenter .",
    "if it loses kinetic energy at its apocenter , it becomes strongly eccentric .",
    "interaction with stars with large @xmath93 is more complex .",
    "however , here the interaction can occur at positions other than the apocenter , since field particles with large @xmath93 can have small @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the increase of the eccentricity is likely to be driven by interactions with field particles with small @xmath93 . in order to test this hypothesis , we performed one additional run , run e , which we started from the @xmath127 snapshot of run b4 but we removed all stars with @xmath130 .",
    "fig [ fig : run - e ] shows the result .",
    "the change in the eccentricity is largely similar .",
    "so we can conclude that the interactions with field stars with small @xmath93 ( and relatively large @xmath129 ) drive the increase of the eccentricity of the imbh .",
    "this mechanism of the increase of the eccentricity is similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "they argued that the dynamical friction on an eccentric binary should be most effective at the apocenter and therefore an eccentric binary should become more eccentric . for the binary smbh of comparable masses , this mechanism turned out to be ineffective , because the change in the orbital elements of a binary is really the result of rather complex three - body interaction between two binary components and the incoming star .",
    "however , in our case of imbh - smbh binary , the situation is very different . since the mass of the imbh is much smaller than that of smbh , field stars must come close to the imbh to change its orbit .",
    "thus , the imbh does have more chance to interact with field starts at apocenter than at pericenter , and its eccentricity increases .",
    "we have seen that the evolution of semi - major axis of the imbh effectively stops , when it ejected field stars in that region .",
    "we have also seen that the eccentricity of the imbh , after the evolution of semi - major axis stopped , can reach very close to unity . from the viewpoint of the evolution of smbh ,",
    "important question is what the final fate of the imbh is .",
    "the timescale of the merging through gravitational wave radiation is given by @xmath131 with @xmath132 is @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the timescale @xmath134 depends strongly on @xmath109 , when @xmath109 is close to unity . in our units , @xmath134 is given by @xmath135    we can see from figure [ fig:2nd - tgr ] that the merging timescale can go down to less than @xmath136 yrs , and stays at that value for some time . in other words , if we take into account the effect of gravitational wave radiation , the imbh will merge to smbh .",
    "@xcite estimated the event rate of the merging of imbh - smbh binary , assuming that all binaries eventually merge .",
    "our present result indicates that this assumption of 100% merging is valid .",
    "they estimated the event rate to be @xmath137 per year , for the detection limit of @xmath138 . here , @xmath139 is the dimensionless amplitude of gravitational wave .",
    "the frequency of the gravitational wave in their final merging phase is @xmath140 to @xmath141 hz .",
    "it is within the target range of lisa@xcite and decigo@xcite .    @xcite",
    "considered two limiting cases for the growth of smbh . in the first case ,",
    "the growth is hierarchical .",
    "bhs always merge with another bh with a similar mass . in the second case ,",
    "the growth is monopolistic and one bh always merge with imbh of small mass . in the first case ,",
    "large number of events has rather low amplitude , since they come from imbh - imbh mergings . in the second case ,",
    "most events come from imbh - smbh merging , and therefore amplitude is bigger than that in the first case .",
    "decigo will be able to detect all events for both cases , while lisa would not detect the majority of events in the case of hierarchical growth . in the case of the monopolistic growth ,",
    "both decigo and lisa will detect most of events .",
    "thus , decigo event rate would be around 50 , while lisa event rate would be 5 - 50 , depending on the growth mode .",
    "initially , the imbh sink toward the smbh through dynamical friction .",
    "however , the evolution of the semi - major axis stops when the imbh approaches to the radius at which the initial stellar mass is comparable to the imbh mass . for our galaxy",
    ", it corresponds to around 0.01 pc .",
    "if the imbh remains in a circular orbit , the merging timescale by gravitational wave radiation would be @xmath142 yrs .",
    "however , in this region the eccentricity of the imbh approaches to unity , and therefore we expect the imbh to quickly merge with the smbh .",
    "this increase is due to interactions with field stars with periastron larger than the semi - major axis of the imbh .",
    "the fact that many of the stars very close to the galactic center have large eccentricities is probably explained by the same mechanism .",
    "for example , s2 has @xmath143 and @xmath144@xcite .",
    "the distribution of eccentricities of known stars very close to sgra * is not consistent with being isotropic .",
