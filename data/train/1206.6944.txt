    "the magnetic phase diagram is rather insensitive to the ferromagnetic exchange interaction but highly depends on doping @xcite , which also validates for double exchange model in square lattice and triangular lattice .",

    ", there exists a phase separation from the electronic density in lightly doped region @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite , we focused on the application of tpem to double exchange model on 2d triangular lattice and discussed the spin - spin correlation and spin structure factors in low- , mediate- and high electron density . in this letter , we still adopt tpem and monte carlo simulation to investigate double exchange model on 2d triangular lattice .",
    "we discuss the influence of the range of fm - type spin - spin correlation and strong electron - spin correlation on the truncation error of spin - spin correlation by tpem near quarter filling .",
