    "the expansion of the universe inevitably leads to a drop of the temperature of the primordial fireball .",
    "this cooling provides natural conditions that are believed to precipitate a series of phase transitions in which `` false '' symmetric , high temperature phases are transformed into low temperature broken symmetry `` true '' vacuum . as the universe undergoes such phase transitions , the selection of the low - temperature , broken symmetry phase can only occur locally , within the causally correlated regions .",
    "kibble @xcite first noted that this symmetry breaking process may leave relics of the high energy phase which will be trapped by the topologically stable configurations of the broken symmetry phase . in principle , such topological defects could be massive enough to leave an observational imprint in the cosmic microwave background and perhaps also produce the seeds needed for matter structure formation @xcite .",
    "there are three principal types of topological defects @xcite .",
    "they differ by their dimensionality .",
    "monopoles are point - like objects that would be disastrous from the cosmological point of view .",
    "they have a tendency to dominate the matter content of the universe .",
    "inflation was invented in part to dilute them and thus to prevent observational inconsistencies .",
    "membranes or domain walls are two - dimensional , and they almost certainly could also lead to the same disaster as monopoles . specifically , they would induce unacceptably large distortions of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "by contrast , one - dimensional topological defects , cosmic strings , could provide the source of density perturbations needed to seed structure formation @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking phase transitions which occur in condensed matter physics are described by theories which are formally analogous to those involved in the cosmological context ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "condensed matter phase transitions have , however , one crucial advantage : they can be studied in the laboratory . with this in mind , more than a decade ago one of us suggested @xcite that the cosmological mechanism for defect formation can be studied experimentally in the condensed matter context .",
    "a number of experiments have been carried out following that proposal .",
    "for instance , liquid crystal experiments demonstrated that copious production of topological defects does indeed happen in symmetry breaking phase transitions @xcite .",
    "more recently , superfluid he@xmath0 and he@xmath1 experiments have also tested the topological defect formation picture @xcite .",
    "liquid crystal phase transitions , however , are of the first order type . in first order phase transitions ,",
    "the process which is responsible for the appearance of the new phase is nucleation .",
    "namely , small regions of the medium undergo thermal activation which takes them over the potential barrier separating `` false '' and `` true '' vacua . as a result , bubbles of a certain ( critical ) size appear and form seeds of the new phase .",
    "eventually , through growth and coalescence of these bubbles , the new phase replaces the old one .",
    "a much more interesting and less understood dynamics takes place in second order ( landau - ginzburg like ) phase transitions . for this reason , he@xmath0 and he@xmath1 systems ,",
    "for which the transition to a superfluid phase proceeds without nucleation , have recently attracted significant interest as examples of cosmological phase transition analogues .    the defect formation scenario is based on two assumptions .",
    "the first assumption is of the qualitative nature : it asserts that regions of the broken symmetry phase , which are causally disconnected , must select the new low temperature phase independently . as a result , when a symmetry - breaking phase transition with a non - trivial vacuum manifold occurs simultaneously in a sufficiently large volume , topological defects will be formed .",
    "the second assumption is of the quantitative nature : it involves specifying the process responsible for the causal propagation of `` signals '' that allow the choice of the new vacuum to occur in a coordinated ( rather than independent ) fashion .",
    "this is the assumption that yields a prediction of the density of topological defects .",
    "both assumptions are of course necessary @xcite , but while the first one is straightforward , the second one requires much more specific physical input .",
    "the original discussion of the scenario for defects formation was based on an idea similar to that of nucleation in first order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it was thought that the initial density of the topological defects is set at the so - called ginzburg temperature @xmath2 , namely the temperature below the critical temperature @xmath3 at which thermally activated transitions between the correlation - sized volumes of the new broken symmetry phase cease to occur . below @xmath2 , the ( free ) energy barrier , separating `` false '' and `` true '' vacua , becomes prohibitively large for correlation - length sized thermal fluctuations . under this approach",
    "then , the density of defects is set by the correlation length at @xmath2 .",
    "one of the key predictions of the original papers @xcite on `` cosmological '' phase transitions in superfluids was that this thermally activated process decide the density of defects .",
    "instead it was proposed that the characteristic correlations length is set by the dynamics of the order parameter in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this `` non - equilibrium '' scenario @xcite represents a significant change of the point of view , and yields a prediction for the density of defects which is rather different from the `` equilibrium '' estimate based on the ginzburg temperature .",
    "in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath3 of a second - order phase transition , the contribution from the potential @xmath4 to the free energy of the system is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 positive parameters and @xmath8 the dimensionless temperature parameter .",
    "the last term in ( [ eq:1 ] ) has been added , so @xmath9 at the minimum of the potential for @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 represents the , an abstract measure of the degree to which the symmetry in question has been broken .    above the critical temperature",
    ", the potential ( [ eq:1 ] ) has a single minimum at @xmath12 .",
    "as the temperature drops below @xmath3 , the shape of the potential changes ; @xmath13 becomes non - negative . instead of a single minimum at @xmath12 ,",
    "the potential has a minimum value @xmath9 at @xmath14 . at the same time , the potential @xmath4 develops a barrier centered at @xmath12 with magnitude @xmath15  separating \" the minimum values of the potential .",
    "depending on the symmetry that is broken , the manifold of equivalent vacuum states for the order parameter will have different topologies , and thus describe a different set of topological defects @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of domain walls , the order parameter is a real scalar field with discrete @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the vacuum manifold in this case consists of the two values @xmath17 .",
    "simple models of cosmic strings are , on the other hand , represented by a a complex scalar field with @xmath18 symmetry of phase transformations , @xmath19 .",
    "the degenerate vacuum states are given by @xmath20 , with @xmath21 an arbitrary phase .",
    "thus , the vacuum manifold for cosmic strings is the circle @xmath14 in the complex @xmath11-plane .    as mentioned before ,",
    "since all the points in the vacuum manifold are completely equivalent , the choice of the expectation value of the order parameter is determined from the initial thermal ( random ) fluctuations through its dynamics .",
    "a measure of the extent , in space and time , to which perturbations of the order parameter return to their equilibrium value is given by the correlation length @xmath22 and dynamical relaxation time @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , the correlation function of perturbations away from equilibrium behaves as @xmath24 and @xmath25 furthermore , in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath3 , the equilibrium values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "that is , at the critical temperature ( @xmath30 ) , the order parameter has a universal behavior characterized by the simultaneous divergence of both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "before presenting the results of the density of topological defects from our numerical study , let us review the original estimate of the density of defects put forward in @xcite .",
    "this estimate was based on a linear quench , @xmath31 with @xmath32 the time before ( @xmath33 ) and after ( @xmath34 ) the transition .",
    "( the idea behind the argument does not rely on this particular time dependence of the temperature parameter @xmath13 , but it seems to be a likely approximation when narrow range of temperatures near critical @xmath3 is involved , as it will be the case here . ) in ( [ eq : quench ] ) , @xmath35 represents the quench timescale .",
    "the other relevant timescale  which we shall call symmetry breaking timescale  is defined by @xmath36 .",
    "it is then possible to identify during a quench three regimes by comparing the magnitude of the symmetry breaking timescale @xmath37 with the dynamical relaxation time @xmath23 .    for sufficiently large values of the temperature above @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ figure1 ] ) , the symmetry breaking timescale @xmath37 is larger than the dynamical relaxation time @xmath23 .",
    "the system is in a stage where the order parameter is able to adjust to the changes implied by the quench in an essentially adiabatic fashion . in particular",
    ", the non - equilibrium correlation length closely matches the equilibrium behavior given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) .    because of the critical slowing down implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , at some time @xmath38 before the transition , the systems reaches the point at which the symmetry breaking timescale @xmath37 and the dynamical relaxation time @xmath23 are comparable ; namely @xmath39 the value of the temperature parameter at this point is @xmath40 the corresponding value of the correlation length can be directly found by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehat ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) , @xmath41 within the @xmath42 $ ] interval , the system is incapable of keeping up with the changes induced by the quench .",
    "in particular , the non - equilibrium correlation length can not longer grow at the equilibrium rate implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) . crudely speaking , the non - equilibrium correlation length",
    " freezes out \" at the value @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xihat ] ) until a time @xmath44 , after the transition , when once again the dynamical relaxation time @xmath23 becomes smaller that the symmetry breaking timescale @xmath37 . that is , approximately , @xmath45 the actual behavior of @xmath46 is probably more complicated ( i.e. correlation will continue to grow even within the @xmath42 $ ] interval ) , but @xmath47 does capture the size of the correlated region of vacuum at the time when its growth falls out of step with the equilibrium scaling .",
    "the bottom line is that during the interval [ @xmath48 , the order parameter , and therefore the correlation length , is to sluggish to keep up with eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) .    the proposal in @xcite states that the frozen out correlation length @xmath47 yields the density of topological defects .",
    "that is , @xmath47 characterizes the size of independently selected domains of the new vacuum , so it determines the separation ( and therefore density ) of topological defects . as mentioned before , the difference with the original kibble mechanism @xcite is the role that non - equilibrium dynamics play in determining the value of @xmath47 . in that picture , @xmath47",
    "was obtained entirely from the temperature @xmath2 ( ginzburg temperature ) at which fluctuations between the degenerate minima of the potential ceased to be possible ; that is , the temperature at which @xmath49 with @xmath50 the potential  barrier \" in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dv ] ) separating degenerate minima .",
    "the reason why @xmath2 does not appear to play a decisive role in the creation of topological defects is likely to be associated with the spatial extent of the thermally activated transitions : local thermal fluctuation can perhaps create small defects , but these topological defects will have a scale approximately equal to the size of their core ( since both are defined by the same correlation length @xmath22 ) .",
    "such ill - defined defects are unlikely to survive  after all , they represent a configurations which may be a shallow local minimum of the free energy , but which have a higher free energy than the uniform superfluid .",
    "hence , they are not large enough to be really topologically stable  change of the field configuration in a finite region of space the order of @xmath22 suffices to return to the uniform `` true vacuum '' .",
    "moreover , such local defects can not easily lead to the creation ( or destruction ) of the large ones .",
    "these requirements are least convincing in the case of monopoles ( which have spatial extent of order @xmath22 in every direction ) .",
    "however even monopoles would have to be created `` in pairs '' by thermal fluctuations .",
    "these pairs of monopoles of opposite charge will be separated by distance of order @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , they are not likely to separate and survive .    we are led to the conclusion that the dominant process in creation of topological defects will have to do with the critical slowing down and the subsequent `` freeze - out '' of the fluctuations of the order parameter at the time @xmath51 rather than with the thermal activation and ginzburg temperature .",
    "our numerical experiment @xcite to test the mechanism described in the previous section for estimating the density of topological defects simulates the dynamics of a real field @xmath11 in a 1d system .",
    "this system contains all the essential ingredients needed to investigate topological defect formation scenarios ( including symmetry breaking , although without an infinite range order ) , and at the same time , because of its one - dimensional nature , it allows us to perform a reasonable and accurate numerical analysis .",
    "we assume that the system under consideration is in contact with a thermal reservoir and obeys the langevin equation @xmath52 the potential @xmath4 is given by ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "( a rescaling of @xmath53 and @xmath32 can be introduced to eliminate the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . )",

    "( [ eq : motion ] ) .",
    "@xmath21 fixes the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "typical values used of @xmath21 were in the range ( @xmath57 ) .    since the symmetry in the system is discrete ( @xmath16 ) , our numerical experiment consisted of investigating the creation of kinks ( domain walls in 1d ) as a function of the quench timescale @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] shows a sequence of `` snapshots '' of @xmath11 for a typical quench .",
    "one can clearly see from this figure the transition from expectation value @xmath58 above the critical temperature ( @xmath59 ) to @xmath60 after the symmetry has been broken ( @xmath61 )",

    "we obtained for the equilibrium correlation length a best fit yielding @xmath76 , @xmath77 above @xmath3 , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 below @xmath3 , close to the landau - ginzburg exponent of @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] encapsulates the main result of our paper .",
    "it shows the number of zeros ( kinks ) obtained in a sequence of quenches with various values of the quench timescale @xmath35 . for each value of @xmath35 ,",
    "15 quenches were performed in a computational domain of size 2,048 units with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this size of computational domain is large enough to avoid boundary effects .",
    "the number of kinks produced after the quench was obtained by counting the number of zeros of @xmath11 . above and immediately below @xmath3",
    ", there is a significant number of zeros which have little to do with the kinks ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "however , as the quench proceeds , the number of zeros quickly evolves towards an `` asymptotic '' value ( see fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "this change of the density of zeros and its eventual  stabilization \" is associated with the obvious change of the character of @xmath11 and with the appearance of the clearly defined kinks . by",
    "then , the number of kinks is nearly constant in the runs with long @xmath35 , and , correspondingly , their kink density is low . even in the runs with the smallest @xmath35 , there is still a clear break between the post - quench rates of the disappearance of zeros and the long - time , relatively small rate at which the kinks annihilate .",
    "( kinks will eventually annihilate , but on slow timescales set by the thermal diffusion of kinks over distances of the order of their separation . )",
    "our simulation clearly indicates @xcite a scaling relation for the number density of kinks .",
    "we find a kink density ( no . of zeros/2,048 ) of @xmath80 , when the kinks are counted at approximately the same @xmath81 value .",
    "by contrast , when the counting is done at the same value of absolute time @xmath32 , @xmath82 has a somewhat shallower slope ( @xmath83 ) , reflecting higher annihilation rate at high kink densities . within the estimated errors ,",
    "this result is in agreement with the theoretical prediction of an scaling of @xmath84 .",
    "an important point to consider is that there are of course no  true \" phase transitions in 1d , and that instead of vortices or strings we are counting kinks .",
    "the remarkable agreement of our numerical results @xcite with the theoretical predictions suggests that the crucial ingredient in the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite is not that much the existence of a  mathematically rigorous \" phase transition .",
    "the essential conditions required for this scenario are : the presence of symmetry breaking and the scalings ( [ eq : xi ] ) and ( [ eq : tau ] ) for the correlation length and relaxation time .",
