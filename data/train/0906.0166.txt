    "mean curvature flow of partitions , in particular of planar networks , has been considered by various authors , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we will show that such a network becomes convex in finite time and eventually shrinks homothetically to a point , as described in @xcite .",
    "our result is , therefore , the analog of the result of grayson , but in the context of curvature flow of networks .",
    "our proof is based on the classification of all possible singularities , in analogy to the proof given in @xcite for curvature flow of curves .",
    "we point out that in the evolution considered here we are able to overcome the technical difficulties which prevented in @xcite the complete analysis of type ii singularities .",

    "we note that to prove theorem [ thth ] the only result needed from @xcite is the uniqueness of @xmath0 .    in the last section of the paper we exhibit two examples of singularities appearing _ before _ the extinction time . in example 1",
