    "tidal stripping may lead to a substantial mass loss and may ultimately ( although at a much slower rate ) decrease the halo s maximum circular velocity ( see kgkk ) bringing the halo below our threshold @xmath102 .",
    "these effects are enhanced because the virial radius is smaller at earlier epochs and so are the typical pericenters of satellite orbits .",
    "if , on the other hand , the cluster forms late and accretes most of its mass fast and at relatively low redshifts , the halos are accreted onto a massive cluster and thus have higher orbital energies and orbits with larger pericenters . moreover , many halos simply do not have enough time to suffer substantial tidal or orbital energy losses .",

    ", @xmath273 can be interpreted as a redshift at which most of the halos present in cluster at redshift @xmath46 , will merge into a central object .",
    "this interpretation assumes that the mass of the cluster would not change , which is not correct .",
    "the actual value should therefore be considered as an upper limit on the actual @xmath273 .",
    "negative values @xmath270 mean that the dynamical friction time is larger than the time span between redshift @xmath46 and the present .",
    "figure shows that regardless of the final cluster mass , dynamical friction is efficient at @xmath274 . for small final mass clusters ,",
    "dynamical friction is efficient throughout the entire cluster evolution , while for medium- and high - mass clusters , dynamical friction effectively switches off as the cluster exceeds a certain mass threshold .",
    "cluster cl1 in figure , evolves very close to the average mass evolution track of the @xmath275 final mass clusters . from the estimate of",
    "@xmath273 we can therefore expect that all of its satellite halos will merge into the central object by @xmath276 .",
    "note also that for all cluster masses , only halos accreted before @xmath245 can be substantially influenced by dynamical friction .",
    "however , even at @xmath249 , dynamical friction may remain efficient in less massive clusters and groups , which , if accreted by a cluster , will be depleted of halos and will tend to lower the bias value further in this cluster .",
    "both of these results are in qualitative agreement with simulation ( see figs . , ) .",
    "results and arguments presented in the previous section suggest that we can identify major processes that drive the evolution of the halo bias . in the linear ( @xmath277 ; the overdensities quoted here and below are for a density field smoothed with the top - hat filter of radius @xmath209 ) and",
    "mildly non - linear regimes ( @xmath278 ) the analytical model of bias developed by mo & white ( 1996 ; see  ) is in good agreement with the results of our simulation , _ if _ the formation epoch of halos @xmath41 is distinguished from the epoch of observation @xmath46 ( or , in other words , if halos are assumed to retain their identity during a finite interval of time after their formation ) .",
    "this model reproduces the non - linearity and time evolution of the bias observed in the simulation well ( see fig .",
    "the evolution of the bias in linear and quasi - linear regimes is , therefore , driven primarily by the halo collapse and merging rates specific for a given cosmological model .",
    "interplay between halo formation and the merging rate in high - density regions ( affecting @xmath279 in eq .",
    "[ ] ) and halo formation and the merging rate in the field ( affecting @xmath51 ) leads to the decrease of the bias with time _ for halos in a given mass range_. this is simply because halos of a given mass collapse earlier in high - density regions than they do in the field ; the high - redshift objects therefore represent rare events in the density field and are initially strongly clustered due to modulation by large - scale modes . the number of halos in high - density regions",
    "is then decreased due to merging , while number density of halos in the field may still increase ( or level off depending on mass range considered ) at lower redshifts .",
    "the ratio is thus a decreasing function of time . in the regions of negative overdensity ( @xmath213 ) ,",
    "the evolution is reverse : formation of halos of a given mass in these regions is delayed and at early epochs their number density is below the average ( see fig .",
    "the halos in underdense regions are thus anti - biased at early epochs .",
    "figure 4plin shows that bias at @xmath213 increases during evolution as the collapse threshold is reaching lower and lower overdensities and more and more halos are being formed in these underdense regions ( fig .",
    "shows that @xmath280 for @xmath281 at @xmath4 ) .",
    "the prediction of the analytical model at these overdensities matches our numerical results nicely .    in high - density regions ( @xmath282 )",
    ", the evolution and amplitude of bias appears to be significantly affected by dynamical friction .",
    "indeed , the process results in halo mergers with the central cluster halo and reduces thereby the ratio of halo to matter overdensities .",
    "the efficiency of dynamical friction depends sensisitively on the mass of satellite halos , properties of halo orbits , and mass of the cluster .",
    "the latter evolves rapidly with time and switches dynamical friction off at some epoch ( @xmath283 for the model studied here ) .",
    "the mass accretion history is a stochastic process and some scatter in the mass evolution is expected for clusters that have the same mass at @xmath4 ( lacey & cole 1993 ) : some clusters accrete most of the mass early on , while others accrete most of their mass at lower redshifts .",
    "therefore , for a given observation epoch @xmath46 , different clusters may be affected by the dynamical friction to a different degree .",
    "for example , a cluster which have accreted most of its mass ( and halos ) just prior to @xmath46 , will be less affected than a cluster of the same mass that accreted most of its halos earlier because dynamical friction had more time to operate in this cluster .",
    "the situation is even more complicated , because clusters , even those in which dynamical friction becomes inefficient due to mass increase , may accrete smaller clusters and groups which , in turn , have different evolution histories and therefore different ratios of halo to matter overdensities .",
    "dynamical friction is not the only process that affects halo counts in clusters and groups .",
    "tidal fields of clusters strip the outer parts of satellite halos which may result in substantial mass loss for a medium- and high - mass clusters ( up to a factor of @xmath284 depending on paramaters of the halo orbit and the period of time the halo spends in cluster ; see , e.g. , kgkk ) .",
    "the maximum circular velocity , @xmath102 , of the halo changes only mildly , even in the case of severe mass loss ( which , as a reminder , is the reason we use it for the halo selection ) . nevertheless , for some halos @xmath102 may decrease below the selection threshold , in which case these halos will `` drop out '' of the catalogs .",
    "this process likely contributes to the mild evolution of bias seen in fig . at @xmath285 . the efficiency of tidal stripping is lower for lower - mass systems",
    "; therefore , we expect it to be important only in relatively massive ( @xmath286 ) clusters .",
    "while this effect may seem to depend on the particular halo selection procedure used in our analysis , similar effects may arise for other selection procedures .",
    "it is clear , for example , that this effect would be even more severe had we chosen to select halos using their _ bound _ mass .",
    "observationally , galaxy catalogs are usually selected using a fixed luminosity limit in a given wavelength band . if the luminosity of galaxies in this band evolves differently in clusters than in the field ( which is strongly suggested by a variety of observations ) , the uniform selection criterion is bound to select somewhat different galaxy populations in high- and low - density regions .",
    "different evolution histories of different systems may result in different locally evaluated bias .",
    "if , for example , matter and halo density fields are smoothed at some sufficiently large ( larger than typical cluster size ) scale , regions of a similar matter overdensity may correspond to different halo overdensities , because the latter depends on the evolution history of systems encompassed within the smoothing scale .",
    "we can expect , therefore , that bias evaluated at a finite smoothing scale will exhibit some scatter in different regions of space .",
    "note that this scatter arises not from the `` stochasiticity '' of the halo formation , but from the fact that the same matter overdensity may correspond to regions of very different evolution histories and , thus , of different halo content .",
    "on the other hand , the differences in the evolution histories result from the modulation by large - scale modes in the density distribution .",
    "the bias is thus also modulated by the large - scale modes and is therefore _ non - local_. note that this `` stochasticity '' should decrease , as one smoothes density fields on progressively larger scales because effects of the modulation by large - scale modes are smaller on larger scales . in general ,",
    "if the relation between halo and matter density is non - linear , the bias estimated from a density field smoothed at any particular scale will be non - linear and will exhibit some scatter ( dekel & lahav 1998 ) . in our simulation ,",
    "differences in the bias between different regions of the computational volume seen in fig . are caused by different numbers and formation histories of clusters and groups in these regions .",
    "the regions that exhibit weaker bias ( i.e. , stronger anti - bias ) are the regions that contain clusters with earlier formation epochs .",
    "the coma - size cluster that already had mass of @xmath287 at @xmath185 exhibits the highest matter overdensity and the strongest anti - bias .",
    "clusters and groups of galaxies contribute a significant fraction of the galaxy clustering signal at small , @xmath288 , scales and significantly affect clustering amplitude at larger scales .",
    "the anti - bias arising due to dynamical processes in groups and clusters can therefore explain the anti - bias seen in comparisons of halo and matter two - point correlation functions and power spectra .",
    "our results then imply that understanding of the evolution of small - scale galaxy clustering requires a deeper understanding of the evolution of galaxies in groups and clusters .",
    "the major caveat in interpretation of these dissipationless results is a correspondence between dark matter halos and observable galaxies .",
    "we note , however , that the definition of dark matter halo in this study is significantly different from a conventional definition , which eliminates many problems of halo - galaxy mapping related to the overmerging problem ( see kgkk and coln et al .",
    "1998 for discussion ) . in the framework of the hierarchical structure formation modelled here",
    ", it seems likely that in every sufficiently massive ( @xmath289 ) _ gravitationally bound _",
    "halo , at some epoch baryons will cool , form stars , and produce an object ressembling a galaxy ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; kauffman , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; yepes et al .",
    "this is indeed a cornerstone assumption of the semi - analytical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , somerville & primack 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , even though we can not predict detailed properties of galaxies hosted by dark matter halos ( which would require inclusion of a substantial amount of additional physics in the simulations ) , it is likely that the overall halo distribution should be representative of the expected distribution of the overall galaxy population .",
    "excellent agreement between clustering of galaxy - size halos in our simulation and observed galaxy clustering , demonstrated in comparisons of the two - point correlation functions ( coln et al .",
    "1998 ) and power spectra ( see fig . 0 ) , is an indirect but strong indication in favor of this point .",
    "anti - bias , similar in amplitude and scale - dependence to that observed in our simulation , has been found in other recent numerical studies that employ either non - adiabatic hydrodynamics ( jenkins et al .",
    "1998b ) or semi - analytic recipes ( kauffman et al . 1998ab ; diaferio et al . 1998 ; benson et al . 1998 ) to model galaxy formation and evolution of the two - point correlation function .",
    "these studies are very different in their modelling technqiues and the agreement indicates that anti - bias is real and is not a numerical artefact of a particular simulation .",
    "anti - bias was traditionally an unfavored proposition because it is easier to envision a biased rather than anti - biased galaxy formation .",
    "however , as we have argued above , the anti - bias may arise naturally during the dynamical evolution of the halo population , even though halo formation is biased .",
    "indeed , all of the numerical studies mentioned above are similar to the present study in explicit modelling of the orbital evolution of halos in groups and clusters .",
    "diaferio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) present bias profiles @xmath242 of the clusters in their simulation that are in good qualitative agreement with the profiles shown in fig . , indicating that similar dynamical processes are probably causing the anti - bias in their study .",
    "we can therefore expect that simulations affected by the overmerging problem and in which a recipe for splitting or weighting the overmerged halos is used may overestimate the clustering amplitude at small - scales and not show ( or show a weaker ) anti - bias .",
    "the amount of anti - bias should also depend on the box size because small - size ( @xmath290 ) boxes are unlikely to contain clusters in the high - mass tail of the mass function .",
    "such a trend is indeed observed ; the comparison of bias in the simulations of @xmath236 and @xmath93 boxes presented in kgkk and coln et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows that anti - bias is stronger in the @xmath93 simulation .",
    "finally and most importantly , the sensitivity of the small - scale bias amplitude to the abundance and evolution histories of clusters indicates that we can expect some differences between cosmological models .",
    "the models that form clusters at systematically later epochs and/or in lesser abundance , should exhibit a weaker anti - bias ( or even absence of anti - bias ) , than models that form clusters earlier and in larger numbers .",
    "thus , for example , a @xmath291cdm model appears to result in a higher value of @xmath4 bias than the @xmath292cdm model ( kauffman et al .",
    "1998ab , coln et al . 1998 ; diaferio et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a more systematic large - box study is needed , however , to test and quantify such dependence on cosmology .",
    "we would like to note that the anti - bias ( in the amount predicted by the numerical studies ) is actually needed to reconcile the otherwise very successful model with observed galaxy clustering at @xmath4 ( e.g. , klypin , primack & holtzman 1996 ; cole et al .",
    "1997 ; jenkins et al .",
    "note that this requirement applies to the overall galaxy population represented in large galaxy surveys such as the cfa and apm ; sub - populations of galaxies may exhibit significantly different clustering properties , as is indicated by the differences between clustering of spiral and elliptical galaxies ( e.g. guzzo et al .",
    "1997 ) , infrared- and optically - selected galaxies ( e.g. hoyle et al . 1998 ) , etc . in the simulation presented here , certain sub - samples of halos are clustered more strongly than the overall population .",
    "for example , as shown in gottlber , klypin & kravtsov ( 1998 ) , the population of halos that loose mass at @xmath179 ( the halos that are accreted and being tidally stripped by clusters ) are actually biased at @xmath4 with respect to the matter distribution , as opposed to the strongly anti - biased distribution of the entire halo population .",
    "the simulation used in our analysis was also used by kolatt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who showed that interpretation of the high clustering amplitude of the high - redshift galaxies is not unique .",
    "the amplitude can be reproduced equally well when these galaxies are assumed to be located in high - mass halos , or are assumed to have smaller masses but undergo a starburst due to a collision / merger with another galaxy .",
    "recent studies by blanton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , cen & ostriker ( 1998 ) , kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1998ab ) , and diaferio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) demonstrate the existence of age , luminosity , color segregation of clustering in their models .",
    "some differences in clustering properties of certain sub - samples from the overall population can therefore be expected .",
    "another observational requirement for the model is a scale - dependent bias ( e.g. , jenkins et al .",
    "1998a ) : the shape of the observed galaxy correlation function is rather different from the shape of the non - linear matter correlation function ; this scale - dependency is also reproduced nicely in the simulations .",
    "recent studies of galaxy power spectrum by gaztaaga & baugh ( 1998 ) and hoyle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) stress that the anti - bias is required at rather low wavenumbers .",
    "however , as we have noted above ( see  1 ) and have illustrated in fig . 0 , the amount of small - scale anti - bias observed in the galaxy - correlation function ( coln et al .",
    "1998 ) is sufficient to produce the required anti - bias in the power spectrum at low wavenumbers .",
    "indeed , the power spectrum of the halo distribution in our simulation matches nicely the power spectrum of the apm galaxies at all probed wavenumbers .",
    "the matter power spectrum , on the other hand , is different from the galaxy power spectrum at a very high ( @xmath293 ) significance level .",
    "the existence of non - linear and scale - dependent bias of the galaxy distribution may affect other analyses that either assume there is no bias or that the bias is linear .",
    "these include estimates of the matter density @xmath294 from peculiar velocities and redshift distorsions ( dekel & lahav 1998 ; pen 1998 ) and from the observed mass to light ratios in galaxy groups and clusters ( diaferio et al .",
    "1998 ) , estimates of the baryon density in the universe ( e.g. , goldberg & strauss 1998 ; meiksin , white & peacock 1998 ) , estimates of the cosmological parameters based on the joint analysis of galaxy redshift surveys , cosmic microwave background anisotropies , and high - redshift supernovae ( e.g , eisenstein , hu & tegmark & 1998 ) , etc . in this respect ,",
    "the lesson of the present analysis is that any use of the galaxy density field as a cosmological probe requires very careful testing and evaluation .",
    "we presented results from a study of the origin and evolution of bias of the dark matter halo distribution in a large , high - resolution simulation using a low - matter density , flat , cdm model with cosmological constant .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this paper .",
    "the evolution of the power spectrum of the halo distribution is significantly slower than the evolution of the matter power spectrum at all ( both linear and non - linear ) scales .",
    "the halo and matter power spectra also have significantly different shapes .",
    "the differences in shape and rate of evolution imply time- and scale - dependent bias of the halo distribution which is in qualitative agreement with the results of the correlation function analyses .",
    "we stress , however that the scale dependence of the bias determined from the power spectrum @xmath295 is different from the scale dependence of @xmath296 , because the two statistics are related via the fourier transform ( see  1 ) . put simply",
    ", @xmath181 can not be obtained from @xmath25 by a naive substitution of variable @xmath297 . at @xmath4 the halo power spectrum in our simulation matches the observed power spectrum of the apm galaxies well .",
    "despite the differences in shape , the power spectra of both matter and halos exhibit a distinct `` inflection point '' at approximately the same wavenumber , corresponding to the scale of non - linearity ( i.e. , the scale at which the power spectra begin to deviate significantly from the linear power spectrum ) .",
    "the inflection scale is @xmath298 and coincides with the inflection observed in the power spectrum of apm galaxies ( gaztaaga & baugh 1998 ) ; therefore , we interpret the inflection in the apm power spectrum as the present - day scale of non - linearity @xmath299 . in the simulation analyzed here",
    ", @xmath299 evolves with time from @xmath300 at @xmath165 to @xmath298 at @xmath4 .",
    "we should note that the distinct inflection point can be seen only in the _ real - space _ power spectrum ; the non - linear amplitude of the redshift - space power spectrum is strongly suppressed and the inflection in the power spectrum of both matter and halos is smoothed out ( see figs .",
    "3 & 4 in gottlber et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the analytic fitting formula of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) , with only minor tuning , provides an excellent match to both the shape and evolution rate of the matter power spectrum in our simulation .",
    "the latter probes deep into the non - linear regime , down to wavenumbers of @xmath301 ( at @xmath4 ) ; we find that clustering of dark matter in the highly non - linear regime in the simulation is approximately stationary ( stable clustering ) .    \\4 .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 , we examine the evolution of bias defined using smoothed halo and matter overdensities ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) as @xmath302 . in agreement with results from the correlation function and power spectrum analyses , we find that @xmath2 is non - linear ( i.e. , depends on @xmath208 ) and time - dependent .",
    "if we modify the model and assume that halos can retain their identity for a finite period of time after their formation and distinguish between formation and observation epochs @xmath41 and @xmath46 , the analytic model of mo & white ( 1996 ) can describe both the non - linearity and evolution of @xmath2 at linear and quasi - linear overdensities ( @xmath303 , here and below the overdensities are smoothed with the top - hat smoothing radius of @xmath304 ) .",
    "the original model ( @xmath230 ) significantly underestimates the bias of galaxy - size halos at @xmath227 .",
    "we argue that at non - linear overdensities the bias evolution is significantly affected by dynamical friction and tidal stripping of halos in groups and clusters .",
    "both processes tend to reduce the number density of cluster halos of a given mass range , thereby reducing the bias and resulting in anti - bias at @xmath305 at @xmath306 in the model studied here .",
    "the effect of dynamical friction depends sensitively on the cluster formation history , which introduces a certain degree of scatter into the bias @xmath2 .    in summary",
    ", the evolution of the bias of galaxy - size halos observed in the simulation in linear and quasi - linear regimes can probably be fully described using the extended press - schechter theory . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of bias in this regime results from an interplay between halo formation and merging rates in different regions and in the field . in the non - linear regime",
    ", the halo bias evolution appears to be driven by the dynamical processes inside clusters and groups .",
    "thus , despite the apparent complexity , we believe that the origin and evolution of bias can be understood in terms of the processes that drive the formation and evolution of dark matter halos and galaxies that they host : collapse from the density peaks , merging , tidal stripping and morphological transformation in the high - density regions .",
    "our results show that _ these processes may conspire to produce a halo distribution quite different from the overall distribution of matter _ , yet remarkably similar to the observed distribution of galaxies .",
    "this result implies that detailed modeling of the small - scale galaxy clustering requires a good understanding of galaxy evolution in clusters .",
    "we would like to emphasize , therefore , the importance of further efforts in modeling galaxy evolution in both clusters and in the field .",

    "<S> we present results from a study of bias and its evolution for galaxy - size halos in a large , high - resolution simulation of a low - density , cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the evolution of bias estimated using three different statistics : two - point correlation function @xmath0 , power spectrum @xmath1 , and a direct correlation of smoothed halo and matter overdensity fields @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we present accurate estimates of the evolution of the matter power spectrum probed deep into the stable clustering regime ( @xmath3\\ihmpc$ ] at @xmath4 ) and find that its shape and evolution can be well described , with only a minor modification , by the fitting formula of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the halo power spectrum evolves much slower than the power spectrum of matter and has a different shape which indicates that the bias is time- and scale - dependent . at @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the halo power spectrum is anti - biased ( @xmath5 ) with respect to the matter power spectrum at wavenumbers @xmath6\\ihmpc$ ] , and provides an excellent match to the power spectrum of the apm galaxies at all probed @xmath7 . in particular , both the halo and matter power spectra show an inflection at @xmath8 , which corresponds to the present - day scale of non - linearity and nicely matches the inflection observed in the apm power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we complement the power spectrum analysis with a direct estimate of bias using smoothed halo and matter overdensity fields and show that the evolution observed in the simulation in linear and mildly non - linear regimes can be well described by the analytical model of mo & white ( 1996 ) , _ if _ the distinction between formation redshift of halos and observation epoch is introduced into the model . </S>",
    "<S> we present arguments and evidence that at higher overdensities , the evolution of bias is significantly affected by dynamical friction and tidal stripping operating on the satellite halos in high - density regions of clusters and groups ; we attribute the strong anti - bias observed in the halo correlation function and power spectrum to these effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of this study show that despite the apparent complexity , the origin and evolution of bias can be understood in terms of the processes that drive the formation and evolution of dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> these processes conspire to produce a halo distribution quite different from the overall distribution of matter , yet remarkably similar to the observed distribution of galaxies .    </S>",
