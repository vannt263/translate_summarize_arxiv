    "understanding the physics of relativistic jets , notably their acceleration and collimation , has been a major area of study for several decades .",
    "it is widely agreed that jets are a magnetic phenomenon .",
    "the basic paradigm involves a bundle of field lines that is attached at its base to a central compact star  black hole ( bh ) or neutron star ( ns )  or to an accretion disk .",
    "rotation of the star and/or disk causes a helical outgoing magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave which accelerates any gas that is frozen into the field lines .",
    "a great deal of analytical work has been done on jets , and the reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein , for an introduction to the vast literature .",
    "however , the equations describing mhd jets are nonlinear and the problem is complicated , so there is a limit to what can be accomplished purely analytically .",
    "fortunately , in recent years , numerical investigations have begun to contribute to the field , facilitated by the development of robust relativistic mhd codes @xcite .",
    "before considering the full mhd problem , it is useful to focus first on force - free jets .",
    "the force - free approximation is a simplification of ideal mhd in which we include electric and magnetic fields , and the corresponding charges and currents , but we ignore the inertia of the gas .",
    "the problem thus reduces to pure electrodynamics in a perfectly conducting medium .",
    "this very simple approximation provides surprisingly useful insight into the general problem .",
    "@xcite derived an analytical solution for a force - free wind from a rotating star .",
    "he assumed a split monopole configuration in which the magnetic field is radial and has a constant strength at the surface of the star , with lines pointed into the star over one hemisphere and out over the other hemisphere .",
    "the rotation of the star causes the magnetic field to develop a toroidal component @xmath0 which dominates with increasing distance : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the star , @xmath3 is cylindrical radius with respect to the rotation axis , and @xmath4 is the field strength in the poloidal ( @xmath5 ) plane .",
    "however , even though @xmath0 dominates over @xmath4 at large radii ( @xmath6 ) , nevertheless there is no change in the poloidal geometry  the poloidal field continues to remain radial .",
    "this is surprising since the tension associated with toroidal field curvature , the so - called hoop stress , is very large .",
    "why does this not collimate the jet ?",
    "it turns out that hoop stress is pefectly canceled by an electric force in the opposite direction , and hence there is no net tendency to collimate the flow .",
    "( this is a purely relativistic phenomenon  the electric field is negligible in nonrelativistic mhd . )",
    "a similar result is seen in the paraboloidal force - free solution derived by @xcite and @xcite , and a more general class of self - similar force - free solutions studied by @xcite .",
    "although hoop stress is very large at large distances from the base of the jet , once again it has small or no effect on the collimation of the jet .",
    "all this suggests that a relativistic jet is unlikely to self - collimate .",
    "it needs to be collimated by an external agency . assuming that the jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are associated with field lines from a spinning accreting bh",
    ", these jets must be confined by a wind from the surrounding accretion disk . in the collapsar model of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the confinement is presumably due to the stellar envelope of the collapsing star .",
    "if no confining medium is present , as in the case of relativistic outflows from radio pulsars , the flow is nearly radial .",
    "force - free jets accelerate very efficiently . in the simplest geometries , viz .",
    ", split monopole and paraboloidal , the lorentz factor of the outflow varies asymptotically as @xmath7 , increasing linearly with cylindrical radius . in the case of a paraboloidal jet , @xmath8 ( since @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is distance along the jet .    for more general geometries such as @xmath11 @xcite",
    ", @xmath12 depends both on the value of @xmath13 and on the poloidal curvature of field lines . as a result ,",
    "the run of @xmath12 with @xmath10 exhibits two distinct asymptotic regimes ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "nevertheless , at any given @xmath10 , the field line with the largest lorentz factor still satisfies @xmath8 .",
    "thus , this simple and convenient scaling appears to be fairly general .      since a force - free jet is purely electromagnetic , the energy flux is given by the poynting vector @xmath14 ( we set @xmath15 ) . for a rotating axisymmetric jet , @xmath16 and",
    "is pointed perpendicular to the poloidal field line in the @xmath17 plane . in a relativistic jet electric and magnetic fields",
    "are nearly equal in magnitude (  [ sec_collimation ] ) , @xmath18 , therefore the poloidal component of the energy flux is given by @xmath19 . applying this result at the bh horizon , the total electromagnetic power flowing out of a spinning bh is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total magnetic flux threading the horizon , @xmath22 is the angular frequency of the spacetime at the horizon , and @xmath23 is a constant which depends on the field geometry ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "although this result for @xmath24 is derived for a force - free jet in the limit of a slowly spinning bh @xcite , it turns out to be surprisingly accurate even for rapidly spinning bhs , and also for mhd jets @xcite .",
    "one interesting question is whether the @xmath25 scaling of power is sufficient to explain the radio loud / quiet dichotomy of agn .",
    "observations indicate a factor of 1000 difference in radio power between radio loud and quiet agn @xcite .",
    "can this be entirely due to differences in the bh spins of the underlying populations ?",
    "@xcite show that a model in which the bh is surrounded by a thick accretion disk , such that the jet subtends only a narrow solid angle around the axis , has a steep variation of jet power with spin  @xmath26 or",
    "even @xmath27 ( a similar steep dependence was observed by @xcite in the simulations of bhs with thick turbulent tori ) .",
    "such a model is perfectly compatible with the observed radio loud / quiet dichotomy , whereas a bh with a thin disk around it would have @xmath28 and is not likely to have a large range of jet power .",
    "this explanation of the radio loud / quiet dichotomy requires agn jets , especially in low - luminosity systems , to be associated with thick advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) .",
    "there is , in fact , independent evidence for such a connection @xcite .",
    "according to the kruskal - shafronov criterion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , cylindrical mhd configurations in which the toroidal field dominates are violently unstable to the @xmath29 kink ( or screw ) instability .",
    "since all models of relativistic magnetized jets have @xmath30 , jets ought to be highly unstable .",
    "this has been recently confirmed by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "why are the jets observed in nature coherent over enormous length scales ?",
    "@xcite studied the stability of force - free jets and found that the growth rate of the kink mode is quite low .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , although jets may have @xmath31 in the `` lab frame , '' they typically have @xmath32 in the comoving frame of the fluid .",
    "this makes the instability less severe .",
    "second , as a result of time dilation , the growth rate as measured in the lab frame is further suppressed by a factor of @xmath33 . note that the above study was limited to a very simple force - free model .",
    "the stability of more realistic relativistic mhd jets is an open question .",
    "we now consider mhd jets with gas inertia , though , for simplicity , we ignore gas pressure .",
    "a steady axisymmetric mhd flow has a number of conserved quantities : ( i ) the angular velocity @xmath2 is constant along any field line .",
    "( ii ) the net mass flowing along a bundle of field lines is conserved , which means that the quantity @xmath34 is constant along each field line , where @xmath35 is the mass density in the rest frame of the gas and @xmath36 is the poloidal @xmath37-velocity of the gas in the lab frame .",
    "( iii ) the angular momentum flowing along the bundle of lines is conserved .",
    "( iv ) finally , the energy flowing along the bundle is also conserved , which implies that @xmath38 where the first term in the numerator is the poynting energy flux and the second is the gas kinetic energy flux .",
    "this equation may be rewritten as @xmath39 where the magnetization parameter @xmath40 represents the ratio of electromagnetic to kinetic energy flux at any point in the flow .",
    "equation ( [ musigma ] ) has a simple interpretation . at the base of the jet , before the gas has accelerated , we have @xmath41 , and so the energy flow is almost entirely in the form of poynting flux : @xmath42 , @xmath43 . here the jet is magnetically very dominated and it behaves for all intents like a force - free jet . as the jet moves out , @xmath12 increases and the kinetic energy flux grows at the expense of the poynting flux",
    ". thus @xmath40 decreases as @xmath12 increases , but in such a way as to keep @xmath44 constant .",
    "if the acceleration is efficient , then we expect @xmath40 to become vanishingly small at large distance and all the initial energy to end up in the gas ; we would then have @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , this ideal is rarely achieved .",
    "the problem is most clearly seen in the split monopole geometry , where analytical results are available for equatorial field lines @xcite .",
    "the flow accelerates initially just as in the force - free case , with @xmath46 .",
    "however , once the flow speed exceeds the fast magnetosonic wave speed in the medium , which happens when @xmath47 , or equivalently when @xmath48 ( from eq .",
    "[ musigma ] with @xmath49 ) , the gas loses contact with gas behind it and acceleration slows down drastically . beyond this point , there is only a growth in @xmath12 of order a logarithmic factor , so the final @xmath12 is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a logarithm .",
    "if @xmath44 is large , as it must be for a highly relativistic flow , the asymptotic value of @xmath40 remains large and most of the energy is still carried in the form of poynting flux rather than as gas kinetic energy .",
    "this is the @xmath40 problem .",
    "the @xmath40 problem is illustrated by a numerical example in fig .",
    "as we see , the problem is not a lack of energy . in this example , @xmath52 which means there is plenty of energy available and the gas could in principle accelerate up to @xmath53 .",
    "however , it only accelerates up to @xmath54 because the energy remains stuck in the magnetic field .",
    "simulations such as those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig2 ] of this paper are challenging and have only recently become possible with the use of the general relativistic mhd code harm @xcite , including recent improvements ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two difficulties with these calculations .",
    "first , the large value of @xmath40 means that the electromagnetic and kinetic terms in the energy equation are very different in magnitude .",
    "the equations are thus stiff , making it very difficult to maintain accuracy .",
    "second , magnetic acceleration is relatively slow : @xmath12 varies only as @xmath55 even when acceleration is efficient , and it grows logarithmically when it is inefficient .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain useful results , it is necessary to simulate relativistic jets over very large length scales , which is obviously challenging . as of this writing ,",
    "only one other group ( komissarov and collaborators ) is able to carry out such calculations .",
    "observations suggest that relativistic jets in nature do not suffer from the @xmath40 problem .",
    "@xcite showed that the interaction of a jet with an external medium is very different depending on whether @xmath56 or @xmath42 .",
    "in the former case there is a clear hot spot ( or working surface ) where the jet shocks with the medium , and there is a well - defined backflow in a cocoon .",
    "this is similar to what is observed in fr ii jets .",
    "in contrast , a magnetically dominated jet drills through the medium and has hardly any cocoon .",
    "it appears that agn jets manage to achieve small values of @xmath40 before they shock on the external medium .",
    "why are they not limited by the @xmath40 problem ?",
    "a key clue was provided by @xcite who showed that equatorial and polar field lines in the split monopole geometry behave very differently .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b which shows that acceleration along a polar field line continues well past the fast magnetosonic point .",
    "in fact , acceleration slows down only after the gas crosses another critical point , the `` causality point , '' beyond which it can no longer communicate with the axis .",
    "the introduction of this new critical point means that the final lorentz factor of the gas is a function of the angle @xmath57 between the poloidal field and the axis : @xmath58 where @xmath51 is the same logarithmic factor as before .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath57 , the larger the @xmath59 that the gas can achieve for a given value of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , flows that remain close to the axis accelerate more efficiently .",
    "this result is confirmed by numerical simulations of paraboloidal and other types of confined jets .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show an example of a confined jet with @xmath60 .",
    "this jet accelerates with no trouble up to @xmath59 of nearly @xmath61 , achieving an asymptotic @xmath62 .",
    "the lesson from this example is that , so long as a jet is provided adequate collimation , it will accelerate smoothly without being limited by the @xmath40 problem .",
    "one additional interesting result is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : while @xmath12 increases , the jet angle @xmath57 simultaneously decreases .",
    "in fact , it appears that @xmath63 , as noted by @xcite .",
    "do relativistic jets always satisfy this constraint ? this can be tested with grb jets , where observations provide strong constraints on both @xmath12 and @xmath57 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "long duration grbs typically accelerate to @xmath64 few hundred before decelerating in their afterglow phase . at the same time",
    ", jet breaks observed in grb afterglows indicate typical jet opening angles @xmath65 radian .",
    "thus , grb jets apparently have @xmath66 few tens .",
    "this appears to violate the @xcite relation mentioned above , which is also confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    fortunately , there is a simple solution . the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show a second simulation in which the jet is initially confined over a few decades in distance and it is then allowed to move freely in vacuum .",
    "this is meant to mimic a collapsar in which the jet is confined so long as it is inside the stellar envelope , but becomes free once it escapes from the star . in this numerical example",
    ", we see that the gas experiences a burst of acceleration just as it is deconfined , without changing its opening angle very much .",
    "asymptotically , the jet satisfies the scaling given in equation ( [ gammafinal ] ) with @xmath67 .",
    "the particular simulation shown here has @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 , which is close to typical values observed in grbs .",
    "( note that @xmath71 is not directly measured .",
    "however , the fact that grbs emit a substantial fraction of their enerrgy in prompt emission implies that their jets can not be poynting - dominated . )",
    "there is room for further work in this area .",
    "for instance , if observations by the fermi observatory routinely find @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 @xcite for many grbs , we would need to explain why these jets have @xmath74 .",
    "the constant @xmath51 in equation ( [ gammafinal ] ) is a logarithmic factor and is unlikely to be much larger than about @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , either we must accept that @xmath42 , i.e. , grb jets are poynting - dominated and somehow manage to convert a large fraction of their energy to promt gamma - rays , or that mhd is not the appropriate framework for understanding grb jets .",
    "the main message of the work described here is that collimation is the key to relativistic jets .",
    "if a jet is suitably confined by an external medium , it will accelerate without difficulty . while grb jets have a natural collimating medium in the surrounding stellar envelope , the situation is less obvious for jets in agn and xrbs .",
    "a disk wind is the most likely collimator in these systems , which suggests that many prominent jets are probably associated with geometrically thick accretion disks with strong winds and outflows , i.e. , adafs of various kinds @xcite .",
    "this connection is worth exploring further",
    ".    equation ( [ musigma ] ) shows that the maximum lorentz factor that a jet can achieve is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "a highly relativistic jet requires a large value of @xmath44 , which means that the jet must start out very magnetically dominated at its base with negligible mass - loading .",
    "there is very little understanding of how mass - loading works .",
    "qualitatively , one imagines that field lines that are connected to the disk have a ready supply of disk gas for mass - loading , whereas lines that penetrate the bh horizon are more likely to be mass - free .",
    "one thus suspects that the most extreme jets probably emerge from spinning bhs rather than from disks .    finally , in all of our discussion we assumed that a coherent magnetic field is already present in the system .",
    "the origin of this field is not understood .",
    "it could be advected in by the accretion disk from outside .",
    "however , the efficiency of such advection is poorly understood and the topic is controversial .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grant nnx08ah32 g and nsf grant nsf ast-0805832 .",
    "the simulations were run on the odyssey cluster supported by the harvard fas research computing group and on the teragrid resources  @xcite provided by the louisiana optical network initiative ( http://www.loni.org ) with the support of nsf ."
