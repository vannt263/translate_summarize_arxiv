    "note first , that there is quite a large difference between the energies of cc and ano vortices .",
    "the second important feature of the results is that @xmath2 has a minimum , which is shifted to higher number of flux quanta , @xmath3 , with higher mass ratio @xmath9 . as a consequence ,",
    "single flux vortices attract each other ( similarly to type i scs ) , however , for very large @xmath3 , there is a repulsive interaction ( similarly to the case of type ii scs ) . in between",
    ", there is a vortex which has the strongest binding .",
    "the magnetic behaviour of the material is thus different from both type i and type ii superconductors : in an external magnetic field , instead of an abrikosov lattice of unit flux vortices , vortices with quite large ( several hundred ) flux quanta form , many close to the minimum of @xmath2 , but some significantly larger ( possibly a few thousand flux quanta ) .",
    "however , the latter do not unite to form normal domains . for @xmath85 ,",

    "formula ( [ eq : nmappr ] ) describes the energy of numerical solutions qualitatively well .",
    "let us consider some special cases here : the boundary between the parameter ranges corresponding to 1vev and 2vev is at @xmath115 , while there is a boundary between upper and lower component 1vev at at @xmath116 , if @xmath59 remains valid .",
    "close to the former one , @xmath115 , the second condensate in the vortex core expands , and its radial falloff , @xmath117 becomes slower .",
    "when the characteristic length scale of the falloff reaches the sample size , these vortices become indistinguishable from the fractional flux vortices of ref .",
    "@xcite in the 2vev case . for @xmath62 , vortices with winding in the lower component also appear .",
    "close to @xmath118 , the potential energy in the core becomes small , the vortices become large , and their flux is localised closer to the outer end of their cores . at the same time",
    ", the minimum of @xmath2 is shifted to larger values of @xmath3 , and at @xmath118 , @xmath119 for large @xmath3 . here",
    ", ano vortices in the lower component become also allowed . in this case",
    ", it is possible to exchange the role of the 2 components , with the rescaling @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 . in this way",
    ", we get the same expression ( [ eq : erg ] , [ eq : pot ] ) for the energy of the vortices with an overall multiplier @xmath124 . with the same configuration as above",
    ", the estimated energy of these vortices is @xmath125 , which is @xmath126 asymptotically .",
    "however , using the large-@xmath127 asymptotics of abrikosov vortex energy @xcite , we get @xmath128 , i.e. , @xmath129 , telling us that at the transition , it is energetically favourable for the vortices to break up into @xmath130 lower component abrikosov vortices . linearising the equations in the other component shows , that these vortices are then stable against the formation of a condensate in their core .",
    "this can be seen as follows : the large-@xmath127 asymptotic form of the vortex profile is a small core with size proportional to @xmath131 .",
    "the linearised equation is of the form of an eigenvalue equation , and we have verified numerically , that it has no bound modes , and therefore if @xmath132 , there is ordinary superconductivity .",
    "in the semilocal model , @xmath133 , embedded ano strings are unstable for @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the effect of an additional scalar field on the stability of vortices has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath134 .",
    "the resulting model is the one considered here with the field @xmath18 promoted to a two - component field @xmath135 . extending the study to @xmath136 , it is found that the range of stability of the vortices is considerably extended . a candidate for",
    "the role of the second scalar field would be the scalar phantom of refs .",
    "@xcite , a dark matter candidate , however , the the parameter range where stabilisation occurs , is phenomenologically disfavoured @xcite . with the added stabilising effects of dark scalars , and possibly other fields , such as the dilaton @xcite or a dark @xmath137 with gauge kinetic mixing @xcite",
    ", the question of finding stable semilocal or electroweak strings remains open .",
    "in type ii scs ( @xmath138 ) , inter - vortex forces are repulsive , implying @xmath139 . in the two - component system , depending on the parameters , e.g. , in the @xmath46 limit , for a range of @xmath3 , @xmath140 , which implies now , that there is a range of distances , where inter - vortex forces are attractive , i.e. , the addition of the second component leads to a drastically changed and richer physics , similar to that of type 1.5 scs .    depending on relative magnitude of the parameters @xmath141 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57 ,",
    "there are different adjacent states in the systems : 1vev and 2vev or upper and lower component 1vev ) . in the latter case , at the transition",
    ", cc vortices become large , the second condensate pushes out the flux into a wall for large @xmath3 vortices , and then this wall breaks up into abrikosov vortices in the second condensate , having significantly lower energy in the new phase , and being stable against condensate formation in their core .",
    "if @xmath142 , there is a 1vev to 2vev transition , and a second critical temperature , below which both condensates are active . at the second critical temperature ,",
    "the new vortices expel some of their flux , and approach the fractional flux vortices put forward by refs .  @xcite . at the critical temperature ,",
    "the radial decay of the second component becomes slow , and our vortices approach the fractional flux vortices of refs .  @xcite .",

    "<S> @xcite , and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for computer simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the multicomponent gl theory is also of relevance for the description of neutron star interiors when pairings of different particle species are also expected to occur @xcite . as the magnetic properties of superconductors are determined to a large extent by its vortices and the interactions between them @xcite , they are of utmost importance .    </S>",

    "<S> semilocal vortices exhibit a number of remarkable features , e.g.  there exists a 1-parameter family of stable vortex solution at the border between type 1 and type 2 cases ( bogomolny point ) corresponding to a deformation of the embedded ano vortex , with a condensate at its core @xcite . </S>",
