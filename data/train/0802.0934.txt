    "it is well known that several meson resonances appear at or close to thresholds .",

    "further possible examples are @xmath3 at the @xmath11 threshold , @xmath4 close to the @xmath12 threshold and @xmath13 close to the @xmath14 threshold . [ the @xmath15 charge conjugate combination is tacitly included throughout this paper ] . amongst baryons , @xmath16 and @xmath17 appear close to the @xmath18 threshold ( 1720 mev ) , and @xmath19 appears close to the @xmath20 threshold .",
    "all these cases have been discussed as ` molecules ' , bound a few mev below the thresholds .",
    "there is much argument whether they should be viewed as bound states of mesons or as quark configurations , e.g. @xmath21 in the case of @xmath3 .",
    "the first objective of this paper is to draw attention to a known but frequently overlooked mechanism which attracts resonances to thresholds .",
    "the @xmath2 is studied in depth as one specimen .",
    "the second objective is to point out the role of zero - point energy .",
    "this provides some distinction between mesonic molecules ( uncoloured ) and quark configurations , which are coloured and therefore confined .",
    "thirdly , an improved but convenient form of the flatt ' e formula @xcite is proposed for the case of sharp thresholds like @xmath6 and other cases cited above .",
    "consider as an example @xmath2 and its decay to @xmath6 .",
    "the conventional flatt ' e denominator for this resonances is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is resonance mass , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are coupling constants to decay channels and @xmath26 are phase space factors .",
    "however , further dispersive terms @xmath27 are required in @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 masses and p denotes the principal value integral .",

    "1 shows @xmath35 and @xmath36 near the @xmath6 threshold , using a form factor @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is centre of mass @xmath6 momentum in gev / c .",
    "there is a cusp in @xmath39 at the threshold .",
    "the fact that it is positive definite at theshold signifies additional attraction appearing there .",
    "a minor technicality is that @xmath40 goes negative after the peak in @xmath41 , since the dispersion integral is close to the gradient of @xmath41 .",
    "eventually it returns slowly to zero for large @xmath42 .",
    "-12 mm -6 mm    if the cusp is superimposed on attraction from another source , for example meson exchanges , a resonance can be generated by the peak in @xmath43 ; if the attraction is not quite sufficient to produce a resonance , there is a virtual state instead .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 make good candidates for such molecules .",
    "otherwise , all known cases except @xmath4 can conservatively be accomodated as regular quark resonances whose masses have been perturbed to synchronise with thresholds .    near threshold , the wave function of the resonance has a long tail , like the deuteron .",
    "the long - range tail is purely mesonic ; any contribution to the wave function from coloured quarks is confined in the resonance at short range or in the decay mesons . in the confined part of the wave function ,",
    "quarks have kinetic energy @xmath46 ; here @xmath38 and @xmath47 are quark momentum and effective mass and @xmath48 is the wave function .",
    "if a bound state is to be created , extra potential energy is needed to compensate the kinetic energy of the confined particles .",
    "this again pulls the resonance towards the threshold .",
    "jaffe proposed that the @xmath2 and @xmath5 are members of a 4-quark nonet with composition @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this may be correct , but a long - range tail of @xmath6 is unavoidable .",

    "it could be a mesonic molecule , as t \" ornqvist @xcite , close and page @xcite and swanson @xcite have argued .",
    "its very close relation to the threshold points strongly to the cusp mechanism playing a decisive role .",
    "a likely possibility is that the @xmath51 radial excitation has been captured by the @xmath50 threshold . if that state were to appear elsewhere , the alternative explanation is a mesonic molecule or virtual state .",
    "present data simply require a second - sheet pole .",
    "the @xmath52 reported by belle @xcite appears as a peak in the @xmath53 mass spectrum in @xmath54 .",
    "the remarkable feature of this peak is that it has isospin 1 , unlike regular @xmath55 states , so it is exotic .",
    "belle fit it as a resonance with mass @xmath56 mev and width @xmath57 mev .",

    ", the principal value integral will be evaluated numerically . however , the algebraic forms ( 8) and ( 9 ) improve on the usual flatt ' e form for a resonance near threshold , but are equally convenient to use .",

    ", it will be shown that the k - matrix approach leads to further terms neglected by t \" ornqvist , but they can safely be ignored in the cases of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "so the @xmath315 could be a molecular configuration coupled to these thresholds or could be simply a cusp effect .",
    "a full analysis is needed of the two alternatives using analytic forms like those presented here . the data on @xmath316 show only a very weak signal in the @xmath317 p - wave , insufficient to tell the difference between the two alternatives @xcite .",

    "an intriguing case is the sharp @xmath319 signal reported by the bes collaboration @xcite , peaking at 1812 mev , just above the @xmath320 threshold at 1801 mev .",
    "if it were purely a threshold effect , it should peak considerably higher .",
    "it is therefore very likely associated with the @xmath321 , a resonance clearly separated from @xmath322 in bes data on @xmath323 @xcite and @xmath324 @xcite .",

    ". a signal with the same magnitude as that of @xmath339 in @xcite would be rather conspicuous near 1800 mev , because of the small phase space at that mass for @xmath340 .",
    "its absence there may be qualitatively attributed to the fact that @xmath341 has larger phase space in @xmath6 decays than @xmath342 .",
    "a sharp threshold generates a cusp in the real part of scattering amplitudes at the opening of a new threshold .",
    "this is a dispersive effect , arising from analyticity .",

    "both peaks may be fitted with a resonance or virtual state .",
    "a definitive distinction between these possibilities requires phase information from interferences in dalitz plots : for a virtual state , the phase falls above the threshold .",
    "the natural explanation of @xmath3 is that the @xmath346 @xmath153 radial excitation has been attracted to the @xmath50 threshold .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath55 to non @xmath347 channels like @xmath150 , @xmath170 , @xmath348_{l=0}$ ] and @xmath349_{l=1}$ ] lead to a very narrow resonance .",
    "the @xmath4 can be fitted as a resonance .",
    "it is quite possible that meson exchanges generate sufficient attraction to turn the cusp into a resonances .",
    "however , it can not presently be excluded that a non - resonant cusp fits the data using equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "the availability of many de - excitation channels such as @xmath350_{l=1}$ ] necessarily produces a strong cusp .",
    "partial wave formulae to assist separation of spin - parity assignments @xmath61 , @xmath351 and @xmath63 are given in section 4 .",
    "the presence of more than one @xmath60 would suggest a bare cusp .",
    "equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 14 ) for a sharp threshold improve on the flatt ' e formula and are just as easy to use . the experimental data for @xmath2 conform with the line - shape predicted by these equations",
    "however , as t \" ornqvist remarks , increasing the precision of the formula and its parameters may be an academic exercise .",
