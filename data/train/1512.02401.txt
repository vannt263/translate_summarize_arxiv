    "active polarimetric techniques allow valuable information of a given scene or sample to be retrieved from the measure of its anisotropic and depolarizing properties .",
    "mueller polarimetry is the most exhaustive active technique , as it completely characterizes the polarimetric parameters of an object .",
    "this technique typically implies registering 16 images using different approaches to modulate the measurement in the spatial , temporal , and/or spectral domain @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of the system and the loss of performance entailed by the different multiplexing methods have led to propose several simplified polarimetric techniques which optimize the measurement of some specific polarimetric properties at a high performance @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the implementation of fiber - guided polarimetric imaging systems constitutes a challenging issue , due to the fact that the state of polarization of the illuminating beam is modified by the optical waveguide in an uncontrolled way .",
    "this is a remarkable aspect to be adressed for endoscopic applications , where the optical fiber stress - induced birefringence is the dominant effect on beam polarization @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of a multimodal endoscopic system including cross - polarized imaging has been demonstrated for barett s metaplasia imaging @xcite .",
    "however , such a technique provides an orientation - dependent contrast , which entails some drawbacks for _ in vivo _ applications .",
    "moreover , the fact that the polarimetric elements and the ccd camera are placed in the distal end of the endoscope is quite restrictive in terms of miniaturization .",
    "regarding mueller polarimetry , a narrow band 3@xmath03 mueller polarimetric endoscope was presented and validated _ ex vivo _ on a sprague - dawley rat @xcite .",
    "however , the use of a rigid endoscope is unfeasible for most practical applications .",
    "finally , a full mueller endoscopic polarimeter , based on a first characterization of the optical fiber using a micro - switchable mirror before every mueller matrix acquisition , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently , this novel technique has been combined with a spectral encoding of polarimetric channels to significantly reduce the acquisition time @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed a novel polarimetric imaging modality based on the orthogonality breaking sensing principle @xcite .",
    "this technique uses a dual - frequency dual - polarization ( dfdp ) coherent source , and is based on the measurement of the detected intensity component at the radio - frequency beatnote after interaction with the sample or scene under analysis .",
    "this technique enables a subset of its polarimetric properties to be determined from a single acquisition at both high speed and high dynamic range .",
    "the first implementation of a polarimetric contrast microscope by orthogonality breaking was presented in @xcite .",
    "a modified source architecture , enabling the linear diattenuation and optic axis of the sample to be completely characterized , was subsequently described and validated in @xcite .",
    "though insensitive to birefringence effects which are predominant in biological tissues , this technique provides an alternative method to characterize biological anisotropic structures .",
    "indeed , biological tissues usually show both birefringence and dichroism sharing the same anisotropy axis @xcite . as a result",
    ", biological anisotropic structures can nonetheless be addressed by measuring their diattenuation properties , provided the measurement dynamics is high enough .",
    "however , all these previous works on orthogonality breaking imaging @xcite were focused on specific examples and particular measurement configurations .",
    "the in - depth analysis of the physical origin of the orthogonality breaking signal amplitude and phase , in relation with the polarimetric properties of the sample and the characteristics of the illumination system , is still an open question .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a comprehensive theoretical model of orthogonality breaking sensing based on the instantaneous stokes vector and the mueller calculus .",
    "this approach makes it possible to describe the interaction of the dfdp beam with anisotropic depolarizing samples .",
    "based on this method , we develop a thorough analysis of the orthogonality breaking signal characteristics for both free - space and fiber - guided measurements .",
    "the results are presented for the basic types of optical elements , namely isotropic absorbers , elliptical , circular , and linear retarders and diattenuators , and diagonal depolarizers .",
    "this theoretical analysis is then completed with a detailed discussion , based on both simulations and experimental measurements , which allows us to conclude that the orthogonality - breaking technique is definitely not sensitive to diagonal depolarization . throughout this work ,",
    "a special emphasis is made on the practical implications of each configuration for experimental polarimetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the instantaneous stokes vector description of a polarized light beam is reviewed in section  [ sec : stokes ] , before applying it to the specific characterization of the dfdp source in section  [ sec : dfdp ] . using the instantaneous stokes - mueller formalism",
    ", we then thoroughly study in section  [ sec : freespaceob ] how this type of laser source can be used for free - space polarimetric sensing by the orthogonality breaking principle .",
    "the influence of an optical waveguide on orthogonality breaking sensing is then investigated in section  [ sec : endoscopicob ] to analyze the potential of this technique for endoscopic applications .",
    "lastly , a discussion on the sensitivity of this technique to depolarization is presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] using a stochastic model of linear diattenuation with random optic axis orientation , before the conclusion of this work is given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "firstly , we consider a fluctuating optical plane wave described by its transverse electric field . the reference frame is set so that propagation is along the @xmath1 axis in a right - handed cartesian coordinate system @xmath2 , and thus the complex electric field at a specific point @xmath3 can be resolved into a pair of orthogonal polarization states : @xmath4 the corresponding instantaneous stokes vector is a 4-element real vector @xmath5 whose elements are the instantaneous stokes parameters , defined in terms of the complex electric field components as @xcite : @xmath6 .",
    "\\label{eq : stokeslast}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the first component @xmath7 is the instantaneous intensity of the field , with @xmath8 denoting the hermitian conjugate .",
    "the instantaneous stokes vector completely characterizes the state of polarization ( sop ) of a partially polarized light beam , except its absolute phase .",
    "the conventional stokes parameters are the ensemble averages of the instantaneous stokes parameters .",
    "assuming stationarity and ergodicity , the conventional stokes vector is : @xmath9 which involves the following time average : @xmath10 it is worth to recall that the conventional stokes parameters are defined in this way simply because in most experimental setups the fluctuations of the electric field are produced at optical frequencies , which are obviously many orders of magnitude higher than those achievable by the fastest photodetector ( so far , ultrafast optical measurements can only be performed by specific techniques like nonlinear optical gating or interferometric detection , which are able to indirectly measure light intensity as well as its time delay ) .",
    "however , in the next section it is shown that the instantaneous stokes vector is a very useful way to characterize dfdp sources .",
    "assuming a dual - frequency dual - polarization ( dfdp ) source whose two orthogonal modes propagate along the @xmath1 axis , its transversal electric field can be expressed as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency shift between both modes , and @xmath13 accounts for a possible intensity unbalancing between them .",
    "taking into account the orthogonality condition between the sop s of the two polarization modes , the components @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the cartesian basis can be parameterized in the following general form : @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the polarization ellipse azimuth and @xmath19 is its ellipticity @xcite .",
    "these equations verify the polarization orthogonality condition @xmath20 .",
    "we set @xmath21 without loss of generality , as we later consider optical elements with arbitrary azimuth . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vecstok]-[eq : stokeslast ] ) , the instantaneous stokes vector of a general dfdp source is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and with @xmath24 denoting the angular frequency that corresponds to the interference between both modes . the frequency shift @xmath12 can be tuned to values within the radio - frequency ( rf ) range , typically from several mhz up to tens of ghz .",
    "it can be observed that the instantaneous intensity @xmath25 of this dfdp illumination is constant and equal to @xmath26 .      on the one hand ,",
    "if the dfdp source provides two purely - linear orthogonal sop s , then @xmath27 and the instantaneous stokes vector is : @xmath28 moreover , if a perfectly balanced source is used ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 simplifies to : @xmath31 which corresponds to an instantaneous stokes vector continuously oscillating at an angular frequency @xmath32 from a linear @xmath33 sop to a purely circular one , as shown in the poincar sphere representation included in fig .",
    "[ figpoincare].a .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider a circular dfdp source , @xmath34 and the instantaneous stokes vector is given by : @xmath35 which reduces to the following expression for a balanced source : @xmath36 it can be observed that the latter instantaneous stokes vector oscillates along all the possible linear sop s , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figpoincare].b .",
    "the advantages of each of these sources for polarimetric measurements are analyzed in the next sections .",
    "in this section , we focus on free - space orthogonality breaking sensing , in which the source beam directly impinges on the sample . according to the mueller calculus",
    ", the output stokes vector @xmath37 after interaction with an anisotropic depolarizing medium is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mueller matrix of the sample and @xmath40 is the input stokes vector .",
    "it is worth recalling that this equation is valid for both the instantaneous and the conventional stokes vector .",
    "all the subsequent results assume that the propagation direction is kept constant , so the measurement is made in transmission .",
    "the procedure can be equivalently developed for the reverse direction ( reflection or backscattering configuration ) provided that @xmath39 is replaced by its corresponding mueller matrix for the reverse direction : @xmath41 where @xmath42 if the reversal coordinate system @xmath43 is set as @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite ( or alternatively @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath46 ) .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will focus on the study of the detected intensity signal @xmath49 , which is a linear combination of the input instantaneous stokes vector determined by the first row of the mueller matrix : @xmath50      the mueller matrix of an isotropic absorber is the identity matrix weighted by the isotropic absorption coefficient @xmath51 such that @xmath52 , and hence the output intensity is simply @xmath53 . in this trivial case ,",
    "it is straighforward to verify that the orthogonality between the two sop s generated by a general dfdp source is unaltered by the sample , and consequently the measured intensity remains constant in time .",

    "it can be readily observed that the beam intensity is unaltered by such a type of sample : @xmath58 as expected for unitary polarization elements @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the polarimetric orthogonality between the two sop s provided by the dfdp source is preserved during propagation through birefringent samples .",
    "this is the property that was originally used to make orthogonality breaking measurements insensitive to propagation through fibers .",
    "the general expression of the mueller matrix of a diagonal depolarizer sample is @xcite : @xmath59 diagonal depolarizers are thus defined by the three depolarization parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "such depolarizers are the most usual ones . in the particular situation of isotropic linear depolarization ( like the one produced by a turbid medium with",
    "randomly - located nearly spherical particles @xcite ) @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , if completely homogeneous depolarization is assumed , the sample is usually called a pure depolarizer , and it can be quantified by a single parameter as @xmath64 .    in any case , the elements of the first row of @xmath65 satisfy @xmath66 for @xmath67 , so according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : igeneric ] ) such a sample does not modify the orthogonality of the two orthogonally - polarized sop s , and the beam intensity is expected to remain constant in time as @xmath68 .    as a result ,",
    "the instantaneous stokes - mueller calculus detailed in this article indicates that the orthogonality - breaking sensing principle is not able to provide a measurement of diagonal depolarization .",
    "this is in contradiction with what was claimed in an anterior work @xcite , and with some experimental results obtained in the same reference which actually seemed to corroborate the possibility of characterizing depolarization .",
    "this aspect is analyzed and discussed in detail in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the mueller matrix of a sample showing linear dichroism is :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 accounts for the isotropic absorption , @xmath71 is the diattenuation coefficient , and @xmath72^{\\frac{1}{2}}/(t_{max}+t_{min})$ ] .",
    "parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the maximum and minimum transmittances respectively , being both of them bounded between 0 and 1 , so @xmath75 . finally , the parameter @xmath76 is the linear dichroism angle , i.e. ,  the azimuth of the maximum transmittance axis .",
    "we note that @xmath77 can be obtained from the mueller matrix of an elliptical diattenuator ( explicitly derived in appendix  [ anex : muellerellip ] for the sake of generality ) by setting @xmath27 .",
    "an ideal polarizer corresponds to a perfect linear dichroic sample showing @xmath78 and @xmath79 , so @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    in this section and in the remainder of this article",
    "we will consider a perfectly balanced source ( @xmath29 ) . indeed , the equations of the output intensity for a linear diattenuator using a non - balanced linear and circular dfdp source have been included in appendix  [ anex : nonbalanced ] for the sake of completeness , and they show that the balanced configuration is actually the most advantageous one for characterizing the sample properties with the highest dynamics .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : igeneric ] ) , if a linear diattenuator is illuminated with a balanced linear dfdp source , the first element of the instantaneous output stokes vector is : @xmath83,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath84 indicates the use of linear illumination states .",
    "this equation shows the essential characteristic of the orthogonality breaking sensing principle , namely an ac component in the output intensity which is due to the interference of the two sop s , partially projected onto each other by the interaction with the diattenuator .",
    "provided that the source can be tuned to set the frequency difference to a value that lies within the bandwidth of commercially - available detectors , it is then perfectly possible to observe the intensity beatnote with a fast photodiode .    according to the previous equation ,",
    "the dc and ac components of the output intensity are respectively : @xmath85 the superscript @xmath86 accounting for the in - phase component of the beatnote signal at @xmath32 .    the orthogonality breaking contrast ( obc ) is a scalar parameter defined from the dc and ac components of the detected signal as : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the amplitude of the detected beatnote signal . in this case , the quadrature component @xmath89 is null , so @xmath90 and the obc is thus : @xmath91 concerning the phase of the ac signal , in this case it is obviously zero as @xmath92 .",
    "consequently , when a linear dfdp source is used , the beatnote component does not undergo any phase delay while interacting with the dichroic sample , and the beatnote intensity depends on both the diattenuation coefficient @xmath93 and the linear dichroism angle @xmath76 .",
    "it can be observed that the obc takes a maximum value of @xmath93 for a linear diattenuator oriented at @xmath94 .",
    "this property has been used in previous works to calibrate the measurement system  @xcite .    if a circular dfdp source is now considered , the different components of the output intensity are : @xmath95 where the subscript @xmath96 denotes circular illumination states . in this case",
    "the obc and the beatnote signal phase are respectively : @xmath97 from the latter equation , the linear dichroism orientation can be readily obtained by : @xmath98 as a result , under circular illumination , the amplitude of the beatnote signal is independent of the dichroism orientation , giving access directly and without ambiguity to the sample dichroism .",
    "moreover , the linear dichroism angle can be directly retrieved by the phase measurement .",
    "such a feature is actually quite advantageous for linear dichroism sensing , as has been recently demonstrated in a microscopic imaging set - up  @xcite .",
    "the complete equations of the detected intensity when the sample presents elliptical dichroism are included in appendix  [ anex : obellip ] .",
    "for the sake of conciseness , we shall only consider here the very specific case of a circular diattenuator whose mueller matrix is : @xmath99 which is obtained by setting @xmath34 in the mueller matrix of an elliptical diattenuator ( appendix  [ anex : muellerellip ] ) , @xmath100 and @xmath93 still corresponding to their initial definition given after eq .",
    "( [ eq : mld ] ) .",
    "if the sample is illuminated with a linear dfdp source , the resulting obc and phase are : @xmath101 these equations show that such a configuration is actually sensitive to circular dichroism , which is directly characterized by the obc , while the phase of the beatnote signal is constant .",
    "this latter information actually provides additional information about the dichroism properties when a linear dfdp source is used , as it is 0 for linear dichroism , @xmath102 for circular dichroism , and takes intermediate values for elliptical dichroism .",
    "however , if a circular dfdp source is used , the obc completely vanishes : @xmath103 which means that such a sample does not break the orthogonality between the circular sop s .",
    "this is due to the fact that they are precisely the eigenstates of a circular diattenuator .",
    "consequently , there is no beatnote signal in this case .",
    "in this section , orthogonality breaking sensing through a waveguide is considered .",
    "it is thus assumed that the source beam is delivered through a waveguide with mueller matrix @xmath104 , when it impinges on the sample still described by its mueller matrix @xmath39 , and is finally collected by a second waveguide with mueller matrix @xmath105 ( which is not necessarily the same as the illumination one for the sake of generality ) , so the output instantaneous stokes vector is : @xmath106 we define the intermediate stokes vector @xmath107 as the instantaneous stokes vector after interaction of the fiber - guided dfdp beam with the sample . in general , it can be assumed that an optical waveguide behaves as a retarder @xcite ( with possible isotropic loss , but with no dichroic effects ) .",
    "we thus model it by the mueller matrix of a birefringent element .",
    "if we denote @xmath108 the first element of the intermediate stokes vector , one can readily verify that @xmath109 , as the mueller matrix of a unitary optical element does not modify the beam intensity .",
    "a remarkable implication of this fact is that the collecting fiber does not modify the beatnote signal possibly produced by the sample , because such an information is exclusively carried by the intensity .",
    "this means that we can focus our analysis on the effect of the illuminating waveguide , while light collection can be performed by any non - dichroic optical waveguide .",
    "concerning the illuminating fiber , its effect is a modification of the orthogonal sop s provided by the source , so it obviously has to be taken into account .",
    "the results for isotropic absorbers , elliptical retarders , and diagonal depolarizers are not discussed in this section , as the conclusions obtained in the previous section are valid regardless the sop s of the dfdp illuminating beam . moreover ,",
    "if we focus on biomedical applications , circular dichroism is extremely unusual in biological samples @xcite , so we will exclusively analyze fiber - guided orthogonality breaking sensing of linearly dichroic samples .",
    "let us first consider a waveguide acting as a circular retarder , whose mueller matrix is : @xmath110 @xmath111 being the optical rotation angle . if such a waveguide is used to illuminate a linear diattenuator with a dfdp source , it is easily shown that the results obtained in the previous section hold , up to a rotation angle of value @xmath111 due to optical rotation in the waveguide .",
    "typically , one has @xmath112 with a linear dfdp source , whereas @xmath113 and @xmath114 with a circular dfdp source .    from these results , it is interesting to note that with circular dfdp illumination states , the presence of an illuminating waveguide acting as a rotator does not prevent from measuring the diattenuation coefficient , while the phase can be determined up to an additive term depending on the fiber .",
    "more typically , an optical waveguide behaves as a linear retarder , whose general mueller matrix is :    @xmath115    with @xmath116 denoting the linear birefringence orientation , whereas @xmath117 stands for the retardation introduced between the birefringence slow and fast axes  @xcite .    illuminating a linear diattenuator through a linearly birefringent waveguide gives a lengthy expression of the output intensity , that can be simplified to : @xmath118 , \\end{split } \\\\",

    "( [ eq : i0cirsource]-[eq : ixlinsource ] ) ) , i.e. ,  @xmath120 .",
    "however , in general the linear birefringence introduced by the waveguide can modify the calculated parameters , and produces an intrincate expression of the obc .",

    "nonetheless , any other situation leads to a modification of the results by the retarding action of the waveguide . applying the bias defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) to the circular dfdp source using eqs .",

    "this is an interesting result , showing that the circular dfdp source is more advantageous for orthogonality breaking sensing through a linear birefringent waveguide , since the measured obc is less prone to be biased by a slight birefringence in the waveguide .",
    "in this last section , we complement the preceding description of the orthogonality breaking signatures on various optically anisotropic samples by a discussion on the ability of this technique to sense depolarization . indeed , even though calculations using the instantaneous mueller - stokes formalism in section  [ sec : freespaceob ] show that the technique yields no orthogonality breaking contrast on a diagonal depolarizer , previous experimental results  @xcite seem to be in contradiction with this statement .    in order to clarify this essential aspect , we first performed a verification measurement using a linear dfdp blue source at @xmath129 nm whose development was detailed in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "the measurements were performed in free - space for two different diffusing samples , namely a blue paper and a red paper .",
    "the detector was fixed in a reflection configuration , with an incidence angle of roughly 45@xmath130 on the sample .",
    "this measurement configuration was kept identical for both samples . as explained in detail in a previous work dealing with spectro - polarimetric imaging of diffuse objects  @xcite , illuminating both samples with a visible blue source yields two different situations . on the one hand ,",
    "the main contribution to the backscattered light when the blue paper is measured comes from volume multiple scattering , as the incoming light is weakly absorbed .",
    "this type of scattering is very depolarizing , and its mueller matrix corresponds to a diagonal depolarizer . on the other hand , when the red paper is used as a sample , the incident blue light beam is strongly absorbed by the red pigments .",
    "consequently , the fraction of light reflected towards the detector mostly results from surface scattering , which implies much weaker depolarization and possible anisotropy of the reflection coefficients .",
    "directions ( dotted light blue curve ) and the @xmath131 directions ( dashed dark blue curve ) , and for a red paper along the same directions ( dashed - dotted light red curve and solid dark red curve respectively ) .",
    "[ fig : diffuse],width=264 ]    the measurements are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse ] , which shows the ac component of the detected intensity for both samples using the linear dfdp source with the states oriented in two different ways , namely along the @xmath132 and the @xmath131 directions . in the first configuration ,",
    "the two linear states of the dfdp beam respectively correspond to the so - called @xmath133 and @xmath134 polarization components at the surface , whereas in the second configuration both linear states have partial projections on the @xmath133 and @xmath134 directions .",
    "it can be observed that the ac component for the blue paper is almost zero regardless of the linear states orientation ( dotted light blue curve and dashed dark blue curve respectively ) . in this case , the dominant effect is volume multiple scattering as mentioned above , which constitutes an initial verification of the fact that diagonal depolarization due to the sample does not produce an orthogonality breaking signal . regarding the red paper , one can note that there is a slight variation from roughly no ac signal when the linear modes are oriented at @xmath132 ( dashed - dotted light red curve ) , to a substantial ac component when the modes are along @xmath131 ( solid dark red curve ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the expected behaviour , as in this case surface effects are not masked by volume scattering , and thus slight differences in the reflectance coefficients for the @xmath133 and @xmath134 components of the incident light beam can result in dichroic effects in the polarized fraction of the detected backscattered light .    an appropriate interpretation of the aforementioned discrepancy between these results and some of our previous ones requires a deeper insight into the physical origins of depolarization . in the most general case ,",
    "this generic notion must obviously encompass ( i ) the optical anisotropic properties of the sample considered ; but also ( ii ) its local structural organization , including spatial randomization effects ; ( iii ) the properties of the illumination field ( e.g. spectral bandwidth ) ; and ( iv ) the characteristics of the detection setup ( e.g. numerical aperture  @xcite and spatial / spectral resolution ) . describing a depolarizing medium with the mueller matrix of a diagonal depolarizer ( as @xmath65 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : diagdepol ] ) ) implicitly assumes full incoherent averaging over at least one of the above aspects .",
    "however , in a broad range of experimental setups the characteristics of the sensing / imaging system only lead to a partial averaging operation . as a result , the description of the sample by a diagonal depolarizing mueller matrix is no longer physically appropriate in such cases .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we propose to use a simple stochastic model of the mueller matrix of a depolarizing anisotropic medium consisting of the action of random linear dichroic elements .",
    "it must be noted that this description does not represent a fully comprehensive model of depolarization , as many physical parameters involved in light depolarization are neglected .",
    "however , it is shown that it succesfully allows us to characterize the progressive transition from a deterministic anisotropic sample to a strongly random one ( characterized by a mueller matrix of a diagonal depolarizer ) as the averaging conditions evolve .",
    "we then analyze the polarimetric properties of the resulting `` macroscopic '' depolarizing mueller matrix obtained , and we characterize the orthogonality breaking signatures produced by such a sample and physical sensing conditions . a simple experimental validation using a synthetic depolarizing sample is also included .",
    "these results and discussions finally allow us to validate the calculations presented in this work , and to understand how the subtle aspects discussed regarding the measurement conditions were actually involved in our previous experimental measurements .",
    "we consider the specific case of a dichroic depolarizing medium in which depolarization is due to the heterogeneity of its anisotropy properties .",
    "for that purpose , we consider that the incoming beam urdergoes random local dichroic interactions , each polarization transformation having a diattenuation coefficient @xmath135 , linear dichroism angle @xmath136 , isotropic absorption @xmath137 , and transmission parameter @xmath138 , where @xmath139 denotes one realization of a random event .",
    "the effect of a given random event on a dfdp illumination beam is obviously strictly equivalent to the one studied in section  [ sec : freespaceob ] , and can consequently be represented by a single mueller matrix @xmath140 with the same form as that given in eq .",

    "consequently , the mueller matrix of a single random event is not depolarizing ( mueller - jones matrix ) , as the individual polarization transformation is purely deterministic . in this case , there is a well - known one - to - one relationship between @xmath140 and its corresponding jones matrix , as stated in eq .",

    "indeed , it is confirmed that when the beam is centered , both contributions from each half of the beam destructively interfere on the detector , resulting in a null beatnote amplitude .    in light of all the above results , we are now able to provide an interpretation of the discrepancy between the theoretical predictions presented in section  [ sec : freespaceob ] and the experimental observations at @xmath195 @xmath139 m reported in  @xcite . in that work , orthogonality breaking measurements were carried out in a fibered configuration , and then compared to the control values determined with a standard free - space stokes polarimeter at @xmath195 @xmath139 m . according to the discussions presented in this section , the difference in the experimental conditions of both measurements can have strong consequences on the measured depolarization .",
    "indeed , the standard stokes polarimetry measurements were carried out in free - space , with a relatively high spot size on the sample and high numerical aperture for the light collection .",
    "such an experimental configuration effectively implies a spatial averaging operation over the sample surface and over several spatial coherence areas ( speckle grains ) as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , the ob signals detected on the same samples were collected through a standard single - mode smf28 optical fiber whose fc - apc connector end was placed in vicinity of the samples . under such conditions , the spatial or angular averaging is very moderate , which presumably corresponds to an intermediate position in the aforementioned transition from a non - depolarizing sample to a depolarizing one . in that case , both the diattenuation coefficient and the sample depolarization lie between their respective maximum and minimum values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entrop ] .",
    "therefore , in light of the thorough modelization proposed in this work and of the discussion detailed in this section , we can conclude that the obc measured in  @xcite were most likely due to a moderate spatial averaging of the local diattenuation properties of the samples rather than pure depolarization .",
    "in this work , the instantaneous stokes - mueller formalism has been applied to conveniently describe the dfdp beam used in the polarimetric sensing by orthogonality breaking technique , and to model the interaction of such a beam with anisotropic depolarizing media .",
    "based on this formalism , we have thoroughly analyzed the characteristics of the orthogonality breaking signal after interacting with birefringent , dichroic , and depolarizing samples .",
    "it has thus be confirmed that this measurement technique provides a direct characterization of dichroic samples , and that using a circular dfdp source makes it possible to readily determine the diattenuation magnitude and orientation from the amplitude and the phase of the detected intensity .",
    "moreover , the insensitivity of this technique to birefringence has been confirmed both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "this constitutes an interesting property for remote polarimetric measurements , especially for endoscopic applications involving optical fibers .",
    "we have consequently characterized the influence of a birefringent waveguide on the detected beatnote component , showing that the orthogonality breaking contrast is affected by a slight bias at order two in the residual fiber birefringence when a circular dfdp source is used .",
    "lastly , we have proposed a simple stochastic model of a depolarizing sample composed of randomly - oriented linear diattenuators .",
    "such an analytical model , along with the results of a simple and meaningful laboratory experiment , clearly illustrates the gradual orthogonality breaking contrast vanishing as the orientation randomization of the sample increases , due to the destructive interference of the dephased individual orthogonality breaking beatnotes .",
    "all these considerations have led us to reinterpret our first experimental results , in which the observed orthogonality breaking contrast was most likely due to the effective diattenuation of the samples rather than to their depolarizing properties .",
    "consequently , in light of the comprehensive model and the experimental measurements presented in this work , it is concluded that the orthogonality breaking technique is insensitive to diagonal depolarization .",
    "this is an important property to be highlighted .",
    "indeed , most polarimetric techniques are influenced by depolarization , which encompasses many physical aspects , including the structural properties of the sample , the detection geometry , and the source and detector bandwidth .",
    "being exclusively sensitive to dichroism , the orthogonality breaking technique is thus remarkably advantageous for characterizing such a parameter without being affected by other sample properties , hence potentially leading to a more specific and robust sample characterization .",
    "the general method presented in this work provides an in - depth analysis on the physical origin of the detected signals in different measurement configurations .",
    "these results allow orthogonality breaking sensing to be adequately modeled , which paves the way for the optimal design of orthogonality breaking imaging systems with the capacity to perform direct and fast polarimetric measurements at high dynamics .",
