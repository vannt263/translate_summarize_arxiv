    "it s well known that galaxies are systems that can strongly interact gravitationally with each other and even in some cases merge between them . also , it s widely accepted the fact that galaxies with a significant bulge host a massive black hole ( mbh ) at its center ( richstone 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , is natural to conclude that these mbhs will interact after a major merger ( milosavljevic & merritt 2001 , milosavljevic & merritt 2003 ) and possibly collide .",
    "the possible coalescence of mbhs was first considered by begelman ( 1980 ) in a study of the long - term evolution of a black hole binary at the center of a dense stellar system .",
    "initially , dynamical friction brings the two black holes towards the center of the system and the resulting mbh binary continues to shrink via three - body interactions with the surrounding stars .",
    "this three - body interactions tends to eject stars from the central region causing the merger eventually to stall ( `` last parsec '' problem ) unless some additional mechanism is able to either extract angular momentum from the mbh binary or refill the stellar `` loss - cone '' ( khan 2011 ) .",
    "there are theoretical ( barnes & hernquist 1992 , 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; barnes 2002 ; mayer 2007 , 2010 ) and observational ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) evidence that in the mergers of gas - rich galaxies a large amount of gas can reach the central regions of the newly formed system .",
    "this gas induces the formation of a mbh binary ( kazantzidis 2005 , mayer 2007 , chapon 2011 ) and can drive the final coalescence of the binary ( escala 2005 ; dotti 2006 ; cuadra 2009 ; rodig 2011 ; escala & del valle 2012 ) .    in all these studies that follow the evolution of a binary embedded in a gas environment is assumed that the gas lies in a disk ( circumbinary disk ) and the binary has a non - extreme mass ratio ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , they find very different times scales of coalescence for the binary because they explore very different disk to binary mass ratios ( @xmath3 ) . when the mass of the disk is much greater than the binary mass it s found that the coalescence time of the binary is on the order of a few initial orbital times ( escala 2005 ; dotti 2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for disk s with negligible masses , compared to the binary mass , the coalescence time is on the order of several thousand of local orbital times ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ; ivanov , papaloizou , & polnarev 1999 ; armitage & natarajan 2002 ; milosavljevic & phinney 2005 ) , which for @xmath4 is even longer than the hubble time ( cuadra 2009 ) .",
    "these two regimes of fast ( few orbital times ) and slow ( several thousands of orbital times ) migration are also observed in simulations of planets embedded in circumstellar disks ( eg .",
    "extreme mass ratios ; ward 1989 , ward 1997 , bate 2003 , armitage & rice 2005 ; baruteau & masset 2012 , kocsis 2012a , 2012b ) . in simulations of planet migration in protoplanetary disks ( @xmath5 ) , these two regimes are defined as type i and type ii migration ; in the type i regime the perturbation induced by the planet in the circumstellar disk remains small and permits a fast migration of the planet ( of the order of a few orbital times ) with a characteristic time scale that is inversely proportional to the planet s mass ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "when the hill radius of the planet is greater than the local pressure scale height h ( @xmath7 ) the perturbation induced by the planet in the disk become important and a gap begins to form , leading to coupled evolution of the planet and the disk on a viscous time scale and therefore , a much longer migration time ( type ii migration ) . in this paper",
    "we ll extend the same terminology to the case of non - extreme mass ratios binaries ( @xmath8 ) interacting with a disk by referring to the fast ( slow ) coalescence of binary as type",
    "i ( ii ) migration .    for a comparable mass binary in a disk , as in the star - planet - disk system ,",
    "the threshold between the type i and type ii migrations is determined by the formation of a gap in the disk .",
    "our aim in this paper is establish a gap opening criterion that allows us to differentiate these two migrations regimes and determine in which binary - disk systems is expected an efficient coalescence of the mbh binary . for that purpose , we will use a simple model for the binary - disk interaction to derive an analytic expression for the gap - opening criterion .",
    "we will test this criterion against a variety of simulations with different model parameters for the binary to disk mass ratio and thickness of the disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the derivation of an analytic gap - opening criterion in  2 , we present in  3 the numerical method and set of numerical simulations that we use to test our analytic criterion . in ",
    "4 we describe how we identified the formation of a gap in our simulations and in  4.1 , we test our analytic gap opening criteria against the numerical simulations .",
    "all the results that we find are discussed in  5 and in this section are also compare our results with the results of other authors in the literature .",
    "also , in  5 we discuss the implications of our results in real astrophysical systems .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "the interaction of a binary with a circumbinary disk in cases where the total gas mass is typically much smaller than the mass of the primary , has been widely studied in the context of star / planet formation ( lin & papaloizou 1979 ; goldreich & tremaine 1982 ; takeuchi & lin , 2002 ; armitage & rice 2005 ; baruteau & masset 2012 ) . in these studies is used a linear approximation for the equations of motion of the system and it s found that the interaction between the secondary and the disk is controlled by the sum of the torques arising from the inner and outer lindblad and corotation resonances .",
    "this approach applies to binaries where the primary is much more massive than the secondary ( @xmath9 ) and leads to predictions of the gap structure that are consistent with simulations within the same regime ( ivanov .",
    "1999;bryden 1999 ; armitage & natarajan 2002 ; nelson & papaloizou 2003 ; haiman .",
    "2009 ; baruteau & masset 2012 ) .",
    "because of the success of this analysis in the planetary regime ( @xmath10 ) , it has been extrapolated to other cases where @xmath8 ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 , 1996 ; gunther & kley 2002 ; macfadyne & milosavljevic 2008 ) without consider the global non - linear perturbation that is produced by the binary gravitational field in the regime @xmath8 ( shi 2012 ) .",
    "this non - linear perturbation breaks the validity of the linearization of the equation of motion .    in this paper",
    "we study the binary - disk interaction in the regime @xmath8 without any assumption of linearity . for this purpose",
    "we explore if it s possible , due to the tidal nature of the binary - disk interaction , that the gap - opening process can be described by the interaction of the binary with a strong non - axisymmetric perturbation on the disk instead of a resonant process that appears in the linear approximation .",
    "this type of interaction between a strong non - axisymmetric perturbation and a binary was investigated in escala ( 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "they show that , when the gravitational influence spheres ( i.e. hill spheres ) of the two component of the binary overlap , a strong tidal non - axisymmetric perturbation is produced in the disk with an ellipsoidal geometry for an equal mass binary ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "they also found that the symmetry axis of this strong non - axisymmetric perturbation is not coincident with the binary axis but lags behind it , producing a gravitational torque on the binary that is responsible for an angular momentum transport from the binary to the disk .",
    "in this paper we will restrict to the case of an equal mass binary ( @xmath11 ) interacting with a disk , leaving the case @xmath12 but @xmath13 for a companion paper . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , is justified to assume that the strong non - axisymmetric perturbation produced in the disk has an ellipsoidal geometry .",
    "therefore , we study the gravitational interaction between the binary and an ellipsoid to derive analytically the exchange of angular momentum between the disk and the binary . this binary - ellipsoid system can be treated as an equivalent one body problem subject to an external gravitational potential caused by the ellipsoidal perturbation .",
    "the gravitational potential of a uniform ellipsoid is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 constant given in lamb ( 1879 ) which depend on the ratio between the principal axes of the ellipsoid .",
    "for the symmetry of the ellipsoidal perturbation observed in escala ( 2004 , 2005 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian of the binary - ellipsoid system in cylindrical coordinates has the form @xmath21+g\\frac{\\mu^2}{r}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{\\pi}{2}g\\mu\\rho(\\alpha_0 r^2\\cos^2(\\delta \\phi)+\\beta_0 r^2\\sin^2(\\delta \\phi)+\\beta_0 z^2)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 being the reduced mass of the binary and @xmath23 the angle between the major axis of the ellipsoid and the binary axis .",
    "this angle is approximately constant over the evolution of the system ( escala et al 2004 , 2005 ) . from this lagrangian",
    "we derive the euler - lagrange equation for the coordinate @xmath24 , @xmath25 where we use @xmath26 .",
    "this equation expresses the decrease of the angular momentum of the binary @xmath27 and therefore , the injection of angular momentum ( torque ) from the binary to the disk .    to derive a criterion for the opening of a gap in the disk we compare the gap - opening time scale ( determined by the torque that the binary exchange over the disk ) with the gap - closing time scales ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) . the angular momentum @xmath28 that must be added to the gas to open a gap of radius @xmath29 in a disk with thickness h , is of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "the torque that the binary exchange over the disk is @xmath31 .",
    "this torque injects an angular momentum @xmath28 on a time scale @xmath32 and therefore , this is the characteristic time scale to open a gap .",
    "this tendency is opposed by viscous diffusion , which fills up a gap of with @xmath29 on a timescale @xmath33 ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) where @xmath34 is the turbulent viscosity of the gas that can be parametrised assuming the standard @xmath35-prescription @xmath36 of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) where @xmath37 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter and @xmath38 is the sound speed of the gas .",
    "gap formation occurs when @xmath39 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath40 with @xmath41 the circular velocity of the binary - ellipsoid system . here , based on previous numerical results ( escala et al 2004 , 2005 ) , we assume that the binary and the ellipsoid ( strong non - axisymmetric perturbation ) co - rotate in a circular orbit .",
    "if we define @xmath42 is straightforward to find that the binary will open a gap in the disk if @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a dimensionless function of the geometric parameters of the ellipsoid @xmath45 , the offset angle @xmath23 and the viscosity parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the geometric parameters of the ellipsoid are approximately constant due to the self - similar behavior of the ellipsoid ( escala et al 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "this formulation of the gap opening criterion contains information of the relative weight of the characteristic rotational speed of the binary - disk system ( @xmath41 ) , with the characteristic rotational speed of the isolated binary ( @xmath46 ) and the thermal state of the disk ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "regardless of the exact geometry of the strong non - axisymmetric density perturbation , the gravitational torque from the perturbed background medium onto the binary will have the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a parameter that depends on the geometry of the density perturbation .",
    "therefore , the dimensionless function @xmath49 has in general the form @xmath50 that represents the relative strength between the gravitational and viscous torque .",
    "if we assume that the binary - disk system is in rotational support against the overall gravitational potential on a circular orbit , we can also express this same criterion in terms of the disk structural parameters and the mass of the binary - disk system : @xmath51\\;\\le\\;1\\ , , \\label{hr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the total mass enclosed by the orbit of the binary .",
    "in this section we present simulations that follow the evolution of a binary embedded in a gaseous disk .",
    "we use a natural units system in our simulations : [ mass]=1 , [ distance]=1 and we set the gravitational constant g=1 . in our internal units , the initial radius of the disk is @xmath53 , and the total gas mass is @xmath54 .",
    "the density of the disk is given by    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the radius and thickness of the central zone of the disk where the surface density is constant .",
    "with this density we obtain a surface density @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 if @xmath61 . the vertical distribution of the disk changes over the evolution of the system , but the initial vertical distribution chosen at least prevents an initial vertical collapse on the disk .",
    "the binary system have an initial circular orbit of radius @xmath62 , coplanar and co - rotating with the disk , a total mass @xmath63 , and a mass ratio between the two components of the binary @xmath64 .",
    "we explore the parameter space @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 $ ] , and @xmath67.@xmath68 $ ] with 25 simulations ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in addition to the disk and the binary we include a fixed plummer potential ( plummer 1911 ) that helps to stabilize the disk and also , when we apply our result on the study of smbh binaries in section  5 , will mimic the existence of an external stellar component .",
    "the total mass of the plummer potential is @xmath69.@xmath70 ( @xmath71 of the total mass of the disk ) and its scale radius is @xmath72.@xmath73 .",
    "the applicability of the gap - opening criterion derived in  2 , remains valid even in the presence of this plummer potential because its mass can be included in the total mass enclosed by the orbit of the binary @xmath52 .",
    "we model the gaseous disk with a collection of @xmath74 sph particles of gravitational softening 0.1 .",
    "we use a stable ( @xmath75 ) isothermal disk to avoid fragmentation , to simplify the testing of our analytic criterion derived in the section  2 . in table 1",
    "we tabulate the minimum value of the parameter q of toomre of each simulation .",
    "since the total potential of the system ( binary - disk - plummer ) is non - axisymmetric and therefore lacks of a well defined circular velocity , we assume initially a symmetric representation of the binary potential to compute the circular velocity of the disk ( see appendix a for details ) . for the binary we use 2 collisionless particles with gravitational softening of 0.1 .",
    "we run each simulation for 10 - 15 binary orbital times using the sph code called gadget2 ( springel 2005 , springel 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , to test the numerical convergence of the results , we run simulations with 1 million sph particles and find that the conclusions found in  4 for our analytic gap - opening criterion do not change ( appendix b ) .",
    "table 1 : run parameters    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to test our analytic gap opening criterion against sph simulations , we first need a criterion that determines numerically which of our simulations opens a gap in the disk and which ones do nt . to determine",
    "whether a gap is opened or not , we explore the radial density profile of each simulation and the evolution of the binary separation .",
    "if the binary opens a gap in the disk , it must have a flow of gas from the central to the outer regions of the disk .",
    "this flow produces a `` pile - up '' of gas on the perimeter of the gap .",
    "this type of pile - up is also expected to form on the evolution of a circumbinary disk that interacts with an unequal mass binary but in this regime ( @xmath10 ) is associated to a drop in the density of the disk and not necessarily to the formation of a gap ( kocsis 2012 ) . the pile - up formed in the evolution of our simulations ( @xmath11 )",
    "is represented by a peak in the density profile and its maximum is correlated to the existence of a gap in the disk . in the figure [ open - close ]",
    "we show that the density plot has a peak or pile - up if the disk has a gap . for the cases that the disk does nt have a gap",
    ", this pile - up is less prominent or does nt exist .",
    "( @xmath76 ) ( see section  4),title=\"fig:\",height=207 ] ( @xmath76 ) ( see section  4),title=\"fig:\",height=207 ] +    ( @xmath76 ) ( see section  4),title=\"fig:\",height=170 ] ( @xmath76 ) ( see section",
    " 4),title=\"fig:\",height=170 ]    we also explore if the gap can be identified as a drop in the azimuthal mean density . although in some cases the existence of a gap is correlated with a drop in the mean azimuthal density , in many other cases there are streams of gas or inner disks around individual components of the binary that hide the existence of a gap in an azimuthally averaged density plot .",
    "therefore , we decided to use the peak in the density profile as our first indicator for the existence of a gap .",
    "in addition to this , we follow the evolution of the binary separation .",
    "this separations tell us whether the binary is migrating or not to the inner regions of the disk on a time scale comparable to its orbital time @xmath77 . in order to",
    "the binary migrates is necessary an efficient angular momentum transfer that can not be reached if the material that participates in this angular momentum exchange is diffused to the outer regions as in the open - gap case .",
    "therefore , a binary that is migrating to the center of the disk on a time scale @xmath78 , is only consistent with a disk that does not have a gap ( type i migration ) .",
    "considering the density profile and the possible migration of the binary to the inner region of the disk , we called _ opened _ to a simulation in a given time @xmath79 , if it has a peak or pill - up in density with @xmath80 ( in internal units ) and if the binary separation do not decreases by more than 10 % in a orbit .",
    "if a simulation in a time @xmath79 have a maximum density of the pile up @xmath81 and the binary separation decreases more than 10 % in a orbit , we called _",
    "closed_. otherwise we called it _",
    "we analyze our simulations at the times @xmath79 in which the binary complete 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 and 15 orbits .",
    "for all the simulations in each of these time intervals , we define it as _ opened _ , _ closed _ or _",
    "indefinite _ if the gap in the disk is open , close or indefinite respectively .      in order to test our analytic gap - opening criterion",
    "we plot the velocity parameters of the system @xmath82 .",
    "this parameters are present in one of the two equivalents gap - opening criteria ( equation [ csv ] ) . in a first attempt we try to determine the values of the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 that are present in the other gap - opening criterion ( equation [ hr ] ) but",
    "were poorly defined because the structural parameters of the disk ( thick , radius and density profile ) can vary strongly ( variations on the order of 30 - 70% ) in the vicinity of the binary , in time - scales shorter than the orbital time - scale of the binary , due to the local action of the gravitational potential of the components of the binary .",
    "the velocity parameters are derived from the dynamical state of the binary that , unlike the structural parameters of the disk , have variations in times scales greater or at least comparable , to the time scale of the orbit of the binary . therefore , to compute the structural parameters of the system",
    "we derive them from the velocity parameters .",
    "these structural and velocity parameters are related through the relations @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    in figure [ param_veldis ] , we plot two groups of simulations ; the _ opened _ and the _ closed _",
    "simulations according to our definition .",
    "the _ opened _ simulations are represented by red open circles and the _ closed _ simulations are represented by blue filled circles .",
    "we find that the _ opened _ and _ closed _ simulations are distributed in two different regions . the interface that separates the set of simulations that are _ opened _ from the set of simulations that are _ closed _",
    "can be modeled by a straight line ( which slope is f as we will show in the next section ) .",
    "the linear nature of the interface indicates that the functional dependence of our gap - opening criterion on the parameters of the disk - binary system works fine , in the range of parameters that we explore .",
    "this encourages us to explore in more detail the significance of this linear interface .",
    "an important consequent of figure 2 is that the extension of the standard gap - opening criterion derived for the planetary regime ( @xmath10 ) to the regime @xmath8 does nt predicts the right shape of the interface line between the _ opened _ and _ closed _ simulations . for example",
    "the standard gap opening criterion in lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) ( equation ( 4 ) ) for the case @xmath87 can be expressed as @xmath88 which corresponds to an horizontal line in figure 2 , which clearly can not explain the distribution of _ opened _ and _ closed _ simulations in [ param_veldis ] .",

    "the other points in the figure , are simulations already in the literature : escala 2005 ( 1 ) , artymowicz & lubow 1994 ( i ) , artymowicz & lubow 1994 and macfadyen & milosavljevic 2008 ( ii ) , cuadra 2009 ( iii ) .",
    "the points with arabic number labels , are simulations where the disk do nt have a gap and the points with roman number labels are simulations where the disk have a gap .",
    "all the points are consistent with our analytic gap - opening criterion .",
    "the qualitative behavior predicted by the opening criterion is reproduced in this graph , as @xmath0 decreases , the binary - disk interaction tends to open a gap .",
    "also if we decreases @xmath117 , the interaction tends to open a gap again.,height=264 ]    in the final evolution of the simulations from escala ( 2005 ) , squares in figure [ param_num ] , is found that although the binary shrinks their separation up to distances where its gravitational potential begins to dominates locally and the enclosed mass is comparable or smaller than the binary mass ( @xmath118 ) , the binary fails to form a gap in the disk .",
    "this is because the scale height of the disk remains roughly constant as their separation @xmath113 ( equals to @xmath119 ) decreases , resulting in an increases of @xmath0 that compensates the decrease in @xmath120 in such a way that the system always lies above the threshold line @xmath109 .",
    "we expect that a situation like the one found in escala ( 2005 ) , should happen in galaxies with a gas rich nucleus , such as nuclear disks in ulirgs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) , submillimiter galaxies ( chapman 2003 ; chapman 2005 ; tacconi 2006 ; swinbank 2010 ) and in general , on protogalaxies at the early universe .",
    "this is because both observations ( downes & solomon 1998 ; genzel 1998 ) and simulations ( mayer 2010 ; bournaud 2011 ) found typical disk s scale height larger than several tenths of parsecs and gaseous masses larger than @xmath121 ( more than the mass of most massive mbhs binaries ) .",
    "moreover , we determine f in our gap opening criteria ( equation [ csv ] ) with simulations using an @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) and gas in massive nuclear disks is expected to be globally unstable .",
    "in such a case , the torques are significantly larger , with @xmath124 of order unity ( krumholz 2007 ; escala 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , in this situation we expect that to open a gap will be even harder than what we found in our simulations .    on the other hand , in mergers of gas poor galaxies we expect mbhs binaries with less massive and thinner circum - binary disks in which a gap will be easily opened . in such cases ,",
    "the mbh - disk interaction will be better described by type ii simulations ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ; artymowicz & lubow 1996 ; macfadyen & milosavljevic 2008 ; cuadra 2009 ) . however , in order to make concrete predictions , is needed high - resolution galaxy mergers simulations that includes feedback processes from star formation and bh accretion , to study under which conditions the criteria given by equation [ csv ] is fulfilled or not and therefore , the binary - disk interaction will be type i or ii .",
    "our study has also implications for the formation of gaps around binary protostars , in which both type i and ii interactions can be present at different epochs of their formation . in simulations of early epochs in the formation of binary stars ,",
    "for example boss ( 1982 ) , bate & bonnell ( 1997 ) that studies the evolution of binary proto - stellar seeds within a collapsing cloud , is found that the interaction of the binary with the ambient gas is through a non - axisymmetric overdensity like the one studied in this paper as type i. on the other hand , in studies of the final stages in the formation of binary stars , simulations of proto - planetary disks around binary stars recurrently found gaps that produce disk truncation at @xmath125 ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ; artymowicz & lubow 1996 ; gunther & kley 2002 ) . between both limiting epochs in the formation of binary stars , it must be a transition epoch that is given by the threshold condition studied in this paper ( equation [ csv ] ) .",
    "when this transition occurs in binary formation , there must be implications in the final separations and masses of the binaries , since it corresponds to a dramatic transition in both the migration and accretion timescales .",
    "we study the interaction of an equal mass binaries with an isothermal gas disk .",
    "we focus on the torques that the binary produces on the disk and how this exchange of angular momentum can drive the formation of a gap on it .",
    "we propose that the angular momentum exchange between the binary and the disk is through the gravitational interaction of the binary and a tidally formed strong non - axisymmetric perturbation in the disk . from this gravitational torque",
    "we derive an analytic criterion to determine if the binary will open a gap or not in the disk .",
    "the analytic gap opening criterion that we derive depends on two dimensionless parameters @xmath89 and @xmath126 where @xmath41 is the rotational velocity of the binary - disk system , @xmath127 is the rotational velocity of the isolated binary and @xmath38 is the sound speed of the disk . we also show that , through a transformation of variables , the criterion can be rewritten into other two parameters ; the first is a function of the enclosed to binary mass ratio @xmath128 and the second is the cubic ratio between the disk thickness and the binary separation @xmath129 .    using sph simulations",
    "we show that the simulation where the binary opened a gap in the disk ( _ opened _ simulations ) , and the simulations where the disk does not have a gap ( _ closed _",
    "simulations ) , are distributed in two well separate regions in the parameter spaces @xmath130 .",
    "our analytic gap - opening criterion predicts a linear shape of the threshold between this two regions and our sph simulations allows us to determine the value of it slope .",
    "the value that we find for the slope is roughly 0.095 .    to increase even more the confidence in our results we test our analytic gap opening criterion against simulations of the literature and we find a good agreement between our gap opening criterion and this simulations .",
    "our simulations assume only one type of initial conditions for the binary - disk system and we leave for another publication the study of the possible effects of different initial conditions on the results . however , we emphasize that for an isolated binary - disk system the gap opening / closing criterion depends on the local parameters at a given time ( e.g. the velocity of the binary - ellipsoid system ) but how this local parameters evolves through time depends on the initial conditions , for that reason , our plan in the future is to vary them .",
    "finally , we discuss how our results can be applied to the study of the formation of gaps on the circumbinary gas disks around binary mbh and protostars .",
    "we discuss the implications of the formation of a gap on the migration and accretion timescales of these systems . despite the generality of the process that drives the formation of a gap , we remark that is mandatory to explore",
    "how more realistic simulations could affect the gap - opening criterion .",

    "in our set of simulations , the binary produces a strong non - axisymmetric component to the total gravitational field .",
    "therefore , for the sph particles near the binary there is not a well defined circular velocity @xmath131 .",
    "this is an inherent problem for the initialization of this type of simulations and we chose to solve this by approximating the binary potential by an spherical mass distribution with the same total mass , for computing the initial circular velocity .",
    "these spherical representations allow us to compute an initial circular velocity for all the particles of the disk , but the system will not start in a perfect equilibrium .",
    "we probe different spherical mass distributions to study the effect of the initial velocity on the evolution of the system and then we select the mass distribution that produce the minor overestimation or underestimation of the equilibrium velocity . the spherical mass distributions that we study are :",
    "( 1 ) spherical shell ( 2 ) point mass distribution and ( 3 ) sphere of constant density",
    ". the spherical shell ( 1 ) produces a discontinuity on the velocity that generates a ring - shaped gap due to an overestimation of the velocity in the region where the gap forms .",
    "the point mass distribution ( 2 ) overestimates the velocity for all the particles in the region @xmath132 because in this region the real enclosed mass is less than the mass that is assume by the point mass distribution .",
    "this overestimation opens an artificial gap in the center of the disk .",
    "the sphere of constant density ( 3 ) also generates an overestimation of the velocity in the region @xmath132 but this overestimation is less intense than the overestimation due to the point mass distribution , because , for the homogeneous sphere , the enclosed mass decreases with radius .",
    "we select the sphere of constant density as the spherical mass distribution for computing the initial velocity , because approximates better the potential of the binary and the system starts closer to a rotationally supported equilibrium .",
    "the system is of course not in a perfect equilibrium and our approximation for the initial circular velocity leads to an initial readjustment of the density profile in about an orbital time .",
    "for that reason , we only analyze the simulations after 2 initial orbits of the binary , that is , after the system has relaxed into an quasi - equilibrium configuration .",
    "we also include a static plummer potential to increase the stability of the disk .",
    "this static potential decrease the overestimation of the rotational velocity in the inner region of the disk reducing the initial loses of gas in this region and the artificial formation of a gap . in the edges of the disk",
    "the cutoff of the disk produces a pressure gradient that drives the expansion of the disk edges .",
    "this flow of gas is also reduced due to the gravitational influence of this static potential .",
    "we use an static plummer potential that have a total mass of 12% the mass of the disk and its core radius is roughly at @xmath133 . with this selection of parameters",
    "the plummer potential s mass initially enclosed by the orbit of the binary is @xmath134 the total enclosed mass .",
    "our results are derived from the comparison of an analytic criterion for gap - opening against sph numerical simulations . in the simulations presented in section",
