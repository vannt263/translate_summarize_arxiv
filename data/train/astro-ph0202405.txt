    "although there is a bewildering array of agn classes , a unified scheme has been emerging steadily ( e.g.  antonucci 1993 , 2002 ; wills 1999 ) .",
    "the nuclear activity is powered by a supermassive ( 69 ) black hole and its accretion disk , which extends to  1 pc .",
    "this central engine is surrounded by a dusty toroidal structure , extending to  100 pc .",
    "much of the observed diversity is simply the result of viewing this axisymmetric geometry from different angles .",
    "the torus provides anisotropic obscuration of the central region so that sources viewed face - on are recognized as seyfert 1 galaxies , those observed edge - on are seyfert 2 . the primary evidence for the torus comes from spectropolarimetric observations of type 2 sources , which reveal hidden type 1 emission via reflection off material situated above the torus opening .",
    "while compelling , this evidence is only indirect in that it involves obscuration , not direct emission by the torus itself .",
    "an obscuring dusty torus should reradiate in ir the fraction of nuclear luminosity it absorbs , providing direct evidence for its existence .",
    "indeed , the continua from most agn show significant ir emission .",
    "silicates , whose presence is revealed by a spectral feature at 10 , are a major constituent of astronomical dust .",
    "seyfert 2 sources display this feature in absorption  as expected for edge - on viewing of an optically thick torus .",
    "however , contrary to expectations for face - on viewing , quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies do not show this feature in emission , ( roche et al 1991 ; recent claims by clavel et al 2000 notwithstanding ) .",
    "this poses a serious problem to models of the dusty torus emission , which must suppress the silicate feature in type 1 objects while producing it in type 2 .",
    "laor and draine ( 1993 ) studied the effects of altering the dust properties and conclude that suppression of the 10  feature requires significant silicate depletion or very large ( up to 10 ) grains ( see also maiolino et al 2001 ) .",
    "this could explain type 1 sed but would require a different explanation for type 2 objects with their prominent 10 absorption feature .",
    "pier & krolik ( 1992 , 1993 ) were the first to explore the effects of toroidal geometry on dust radiative transfer .",
    "they note that the agn dust must be in clumps to protect the grains , but because of the difficulties in modeling a clumpy distribution they approximate it with a uniform one instead .",
    "they also neglect scattering . in spite of these approximations",
    ", their results are encouraging .",
    "the directional dependence of their model radiation reproduces the gross features of observed sed , indicating that the toroidal geometry captures the essence of ir observations .",
    "two major problems remain : the observed emission has a far - ir peak much broader than the models can produce , and the silicate emission feature is suppressed in face - on viewing only in a narrow , finely - tuned range of the model parameters .",
    "rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) notes that both problems could be alleviated by clumpiness .",
    "he argues that a spherical shell is an adequate proxy for a clump , and produces type 1 ir emission from a superposition of such concentric shells .",
    "but the shell / clump analogy is fundamentally problematic : since the illuminated and dark faces of a clump produce widely different spectra , the observed sed varies with the angle between radiation source , clump and observer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "in contrast , outside an optically thick spherical shell the sed is always the same irrespective of observer location because only the dark side is ever visible ( inside the shell , only the illuminated face is visible ) .",
    "concentric spherical shells can not substitute for clumps .",
    "we performed a more adequate calculation of ir emission from an obscuring clumpy torus , combining realistic modeling of the emission from externally illuminated clumps with proper handling of cloud shadowing .",
    "the latter is an essential ingredient since the number of clouds along radial rays through the torus must be sufficiently large to ensure that x - rays from the central engine are virtually always attenuated in type 2 objects ( guainazzi et al 2001 ) .",
    "here we report the results of our effort , which show that the sed of both type 1 and type 2 objects are properly reproduced at different viewing angles of the same clumpy torus  in agreement with unified schemes . in a forthcoming publication",
    "we will provide a more detailed account of our calculations and the results .",
    "consider a medium where the dust is in clouds . for simplicity , each cloud has the same optical depth @xmath0 . along a given path , the mean number of clouds encountered in segment @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mean free path between clouds ( @xmath4 is the cloud area perpendicular to the path and @xmath5 is the number density of clouds ) . as long as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cloud radius , each cloud can be considered a point source of intensity  , and the intensity generated along the segment is @xmath8 .",
    "denote by  the probability that this radiation propagate along the rest of the path without absorption by any other cloud .",
    "natta & panagia ( 1984 ) show that poisson statistics for the distribution of clumps yields and @xmath9 is the mean number of clouds along the rest of the path .",
    "the contribution of segment @xmath1 to the emerging intensity is simply @xmath10 and the flux from the cloud distribution at distance @xmath11 is where @xmath12 is the surface area element perpendicular to the line of sight . given the geometry , the flux can be calculated from this expression once   is known .",
    "clouds are heated by radiation from both the agn and all other clouds .",
    "consider first the direct heating by the agn ( figure [ fig : setup ] ) . since our interest is in optically thick clouds only ,",
    "the dust temperature is much higher on the illuminated face than any other part of the surface .",
    "therefore the cloud emission varies strongly with direction , and the corresponding source function @xmath13 depends on both distance @xmath14 and position angle @xmath15 .",
    "the clump shape is of course arbitrary , and we have constructed  synthetic clumps \" by averaging the emission from an illuminated slab over all possible slab orientations .",
    "this procedure utilizes an exact solution of radiative transfer for external illumination and also reproduces the @xmath15-dependence of the observed fraction of illuminated area on the surface of a spherical - like object .",
    "we conducted detailed calculations with the code dusty ( ivezi , nenkova & elitzur 1999 ) .",
    "the code preforms an exact solution of the slab radiative transfer problem including dust absorption , emission and scattering .",
    "the optical depth across the slab thickness at wavelength @xmath16 is @xmath17 where  is the optical depth at visual and @xmath18 is the proper efficiency factor of standard interstellar dust . with agn luminosity @xmath19 ,",
    "the illuminating bolometric flux is @xmath20 .",
    "its spectral shape , typical for agn , is @xmath21 = constant in the wavelength range 0.010.1  and @xmath22 for 0.1100  ( cf pier & krolik 92 , laor & draine 93 ) . for any slab orientation ,",
    "the solution of the radiative transfer problem determines the temperature run in the slab and the intensity it emits toward any direction .",
    "therefore the dust temperature  on the illuminated face of a slab normal to the radius vector can replace the external flux @xmath23 as a specifier of location .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : sclump ] shows typical results for .",
    "the clump spectrum was constructed by averaging over all slab orientations the solutions for slabs with  = 100 at radial distances where  = 800 k ( corresponding to @xmath14 = 4@xmath24 pc ) .",
    "the 10  silicate feature is seen in absorption at small @xmath15 , switching to increasingly more pronounced emission as @xmath15 increases and a larger fraction of the clump illuminated face becomes visible .",
    "an exact calculation of the effects of diffuse radiation from all clouds is a formidable task , akin to a full solution of the radiative transfer problem in which individual dust particles themselves are dusty clouds .",
    "however , compared with the agn radiation , heating by the diffuse radiation is highly inefficient because it involves long wavelengths , and thus can be neglected .",
    "emission from clouds with direct view of the agn is well described by .",
    "but clouds whose line - of - sight to the agn is blocked by another cloud will be heated only indirectly by the diffuse radiation .",
    "we approximate the diffuse radiation field at @xmath14 by angle - averaging over @xmath15 the emission @xmath13 from clouds directly heated by the agn . in this radiation field",
    "we imbed a sphere with constant density profile and solve for its temperature and emission .",
    "our approximation for the source function of indirectly illuminated clouds is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the flux and @xmath27 the solid angle of such a sphere at a large distance .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sclump ] shows a sample of , together with the corresponding source functions for direct heating .    at distance",
    "@xmath14 the probability for unhindered view of the agn is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mean number of clouds to the agn .",
    "our approximation for the clump source function is the steps we outlined can be iterated to become an exact solution scheme for radiative transfer in clumpy medium .",
    "the small magnitude at short wavelengths , which control heating , of /  evident in figure [ fig : sclump ] indicates that this process should converge rapidly .",
    "[ eq : s ] is equivalent to its first two steps .",
    "we model the agn obscuring region as a toroidal distribution of dusty clouds , shown in figure [ fig : setup ] . instead of the inner radius  we specify as input  = ( ) , the surface temperature of a normally illuminated slab at . in all calculations we set  = 1400 k , the temperature below which both silicate and graphite grains exist ; this choice implies  = @xmath30 pc for a  = 100 cloud .",
    "the geometry requires two additional input parameters : the torus thickness @xmath31 , equivalent to the lowest  in the torus , and @xmath32 , the conical opening half - angle . assuming power law variation for the mean free path @xmath33 , the cloud distribution is described by the two input parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the number of clouds along a radial ray through the torus .",
    "the final free parameter is , the optical depth of each cloud .",
    "the grain efficiency factor @xmath18 and the agn spectral shape @xmath36 are set to their standard values .",
    "the observed flux is determined from where @xmath37 is calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : fc ] and @xmath38 from eq .",
    "[ eq : pesc ] with @xmath39 for type 2 sources and zero for type 1 . extracting the overall bolometric flux @xmath40 , the sed is controlled by  and five dimensionless free parameters : @xmath41 and @xmath32 specify the geometry ,  the individual clouds and  and @xmath34 the cloud distribution .",
    "we performed extensive calculations and find a large range of the free parameters that yield satisfactory agreement with observations .",
    "a detailed report of our results will be provided elsewhere , here we show in figure [ fig : sed ] a representative model .",
    "our aim is to reproduce the typical sed of the type 1 and type 2 families , not to fit in detail any particular object .",
    "data points for type 1 sources show average spectra for radio - quiet quasars ( sanders et al 1989 , elvis et al 1994 ) and seyfert 1 galaxies ( granato & danese 1994 ) . because of the high obscuration of the agn in type 2 sources , fluxes for their nuclear regions properly extracted out of the contributions of the host galaxy and starburst regions are scarce .",
    "we show data for reliable measurements of four individual objects .",
    "the data were scaled for a rough match of the model results without attempting a best fit .",
    "detailed fitting of type 2 objects , when warranted , will determine their bolometric flux , a quantity inaccessible for direct measurement because the bulk of the flux is emitted away from earth .",
    "our models reproduce the broad ir bump extending to  100 , as observed .",
    "furthermore , the 10  feature appears in absorption in equatorial viewing but is smeared out in axial viewing in spite of its prominence in emission from directly - heated individual clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sclump ] ) .",
    "the reason is that most of these clouds are blocked from view even along the axis .",
    "we find satisfactory results for conical opening @xmath42 .",
    "the torus thickness can vary in the range @xmath41 = 50250 , i.e. , /@xmath24",
    "= 60300 pc . at smaller @xmath41",
    "the ir bump is not broad enough , larger @xmath41 produce too much 20100  emission .",
    "the number of clouds is  = 510 .",
    "when @xmath43 the 10  feature appears in emission in pole - on spectra , @xmath44 shifts the spectrum to longer wavelengths resulting in too little 110emission and too much 20100",
    ". the power index should be @xmath45 . at larger @xmath34",
    "the far - ir bump is not high enough , as is evident in figure [ fig : sed ] , at smaller @xmath34 it is too high .",
    "significantly , the only constraint on the optical depth of individual clouds is  60 .",
    "the results vary only slightly when  increases from 60 to 100 , and hardly at all during further increase .",
    "the reason is simple . the dependence on  arises from the probability for photon escape and the cloud source function . from eq .",
    "[ eq : pesc ] , @xmath46 whenever @xmath47 , and at  60 this condition is met at all relevant wavelengths .",
    "similarly , because the clouds are heated externally , only their surface is heated significantly when  is large .",
    "increasing  further only adds cool material , thus ",
    "saturates for all relevant @xmath16 , similar to standard black - body emission . extending our calculations all the way to = 500",
    ", we have verified that increasing  indeed has no effect on the model results .",
    "the cloud distribution is described by @xmath34 and , individual clouds by the optical depth .",
    "no other cloud property was specified .",
    "the cloud size enters only indirectly through the underlying assumption @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 is the volume of a single cloud , the volume filling factor of the cloud population is @xmath50 .",
    "our calculations apply to small filling factors , @xmath51 , the pier & krolik model involves the opposite limit @xmath52 .",
    "the mean free path scale can be determined from @xmath53 . the model with @xmath34 = 1 ,",
    "= 5 and @xmath41 = 100 has @xmath54 pc .",
    "a reasonable realization of this model , though not unique , is a constant @xmath55 throughout the torus so that @xmath7 = 0.09r .",
    "when  = 100 and @xmath56 = 1 , the clouds vary from @xmath7  0.1 pc with gas density  35@xmath57 in the torus inner regions to @xmath7  10 pc with density  33  @xmath57 at the outer edge .",
    "the torus could contain additional clouds with smaller  without significantly affecting the sed .",
    "the properties we deduce for the torus agree with independent estimates . based on 88 seyfert galaxies schmitt et al ( 2001 ) conclude that @xmath32 = 48 , at the center of the range we find .",
    "our minimal cloud number  = 5 implies a probability @xmath58 = 7 for unattenuated view of the agn in type 2 sources , in agreement with the findings of guainazzi et al ( 2001 ) . from x - ray measurements of 73 seyfert 2 galaxies bassani",
    "et al ( 1999 ) find a large variation in column density , with a mean of @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath60 for as many as a third of the sources .",
    "the mean is comparable with the column density of our torus for 5 clouds of  60 each and standard dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "furthermore , the similarity of sed among type 2 sources in spite of the large x - rays column variation is a natural consequence of our model :  is bounded only from below , the sed remains the same at all @xmath61 for arbitrary increase in overall column .",
    "but x - ray absorption does vary with the latter because the optical depth for thompson scattering is only  .",
    "sources with small columns may show up in x - ray absorption while selectively excluded from ir observations because of their weak emission .",
    "our results add strong support for unification schemes of agn . in accordance with such schemes ,",
    "the ir emission from both type 1 and type 2 sources is reproduced at different viewing of the same geometry when proper account is taken of the torus clumpiness .",
