    "thanks to the advanced x - ray missions ( e.g. , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) , it is now high time for astrophysicists to research into the nature of pulsars and relevant issues .",
    "pulsar - like stars are unique astro - laboratories to study matter at supranuclear density .",
    "on the one hand , due to the mathematical complexity of the nonlinear nature of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , one believed to be the underlying theory for strong interaction , we can not determine the state of supranuclear matter by first principles .",
    "several speculations have to be presented in the literatures , including those currently focused state - of - the - art nuclear equations ( normal neutron stars ) . besides these conjectures ,",
    "stable strange quark matter state ( quark stars ) has been alternatively proposed since quark matter is a direct consequence of the `` asymptotic freedom '' which was found experimentally in 1960s and proved by qcd in 1973 . on the other hand , recent observations show new members of the family of pulsar - like stars ( e.g. , anomalous x - ray pulsars / soft gamma - ray repeaters , central compact objects , and dim thermal neutron stars ) , whose different manifestations are not well understood and could challenge the conventional scenario of normal neutron stars . in fact , neutron stars and quark stars should now be considered as two potential models equally possible for the nature of pulsar - like stars ( see reviews e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how do quark stars form ? this is a question with bimodality of meaning .",
    "( i ) it is straightforward to know their births if one believes pulsars are actually quark stars .",
    "the astrophysics of phase conversion from nuclear matter to quark matter during , e.g. , spindown or accretion stages is investigated at a preliminary step @xcite ; but that quark star formation occurs simultaneously during the collapsing of massive star s cores has not been treated previously , which will be focused in this paper .",
    "( ii ) could core - collapse - produced quark stars result in successful supernovae ?",
    "while supernovae keep occurring above the sky , the failure to simulate an explosion successfully in calculations troubles astrophysicists over time . in reviewing the neutrino - driven explosion model , the call for an alternative mechanism grew stronger  @xcite . since strange quark matter ( sqm )",
    "could be the real ground state @xcite , it is suggested that sqm - formation may help to overcome the energy difficulty in getting type - ii supernovae successful , because more neutrinos should be radiated if phase - transition to sqm is included @xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that bare quark surfaces could be essential to successful explosions , for both @xmath3-ray bursts and core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the reason for that is simple and intuitive : due to the chromatic confinement , the photon luminosity of a quark surface is not limited by the eddington limit . regarding the ultra - high surface temperature of nascent strange stars  @xcite , we believe that the strong radiation pressure caused by enormous thermal emissions from strange stars might plays a more important role in promoting a shock , substituting neutrinos in conventional delayed shock mechanism .",
    "we call this proposed scenario as a _ photon - driven supernova_. quark stars formed in this way should be bare , and factually , there are possible observational evidence for bare strange stars @xcite .",
    "due to the different properties between neutron stars and strange stars , the consequent mechanism in explosion could be significantly altered . a detonation wave burning nuclear matter into strange matter spreads out from the core  @xcite , where the density declines as radius increases .",
    "a boundary of strange matter and nuclear matter will be set where the detonation wave stops when nuclear matter density drops blow a critical value . nevertheless , the outer mantle on the other hand is still in - falling with hardly any variation since the detonation wave travels faster than the sound speed . in both the prompt and the delayed shock mechanisms ,",
    "the previous shock which ejects the overlying mantle is initially generated by the bounce at the surface of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "however , if a nascent strange star is formed by a detonation wave , the strange matter behind the wavefront is considered nearly at rest  @xcite and hence no bounce could be introduced .    as a consequence of the high optical opacity in the collapsing core with density @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 ,",
    "the radiation pressure caused by photon - electron scattering prevents a thin layer of nuclear matters outside from falling onto the surface of nascent strange star and thus inverses its velocity , where @xmath7 , atomic charge number @xmath8 , and hydrogen mass fraction @xmath9 .",
    "this layer being affected extends to the sonic point because super - sonic fluid can not be affected by perturbations downstream .",
    "as soon as the layer between the strange star surface and the sonic point assembles the radiation pressure after an equilibrium is established , a shock will be generated at the sonic point for the discontinuities in both density and pressure .",
    "as the overlying mantle is driven outwards by the shock , a gap is left between the strange star and the out - going matter .",
    "this gap is filled up by a _ fireball _",
    ", with high energy photons and electron - positron pair plasma emitted from the hot strange star .",
    "we illustrate the initial collapsing core divided into four parts in fig .",
    "[ fig1:illustration ] .    though annihilation of @xmath3 into @xmath10 pairs and the reverse process take place at such high energy scale , the total momentum and energy fluxes are preserved .",
    "hence we may still adopt the formula @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is radiation pressure and @xmath13 is the radiation constant",
    ". the pressure decreases as the fireball expands , with an assumption of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius of fireball . in a radiation dominated relativistic fireball with a vacuum exterior , we have @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "however , the exterior of the fireball is actually not vacuum but fall - back matter , which must exert a force to the fireball . the expanding speed of fireball is lower than the speed of light , and the radiation pressure",
    "should then not drop so fast , i.e. the index @xmath18 could be smaller than 4 . in a special case for normal radiation , one may have @xmath19 from flux conservation .",
    "therefore we generalize the relation as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radius of the strange star , and three cases of @xmath22 will be considered .",
    "our main goal is to check whether the work done on the overlying mantle by the radiation pressure is comparable to @xmath23 erg , the typical energy needed for a successful supernova explosion .",
    "the work done by the fireball reads , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the final distance that the radiation pressure could push the out layers to .",
    "the distance can be estimated by velocity of the shocked matter and the radiation - dominated timescale .    since mean free path of photons in dense nuclear matter",
    "is extremely short , @xmath26 , radiative heating is very inefficient .",
    "the time scale for transferring most part of the energy to the shock is excessively shorter than the kinematic timescale , as we can see later in our calculation .",
    "the lack of energy transferred to the outside of fireball could essentially help a successful explosion .",
    "moreover , we can therefore omit the thin layer that has been heated in region 2 and consider the pressure within these two regions contributed by degenerate electrons alone , complying with the polytropic equations : @xmath27 . because both the shock and the shocked matter are supported by the radiation pressure",
    "ultimately , we assume that pressure in region 2 equals to the radiation pressure for simplicity though in the actual explosion non - uniform pressure distribution must exists .",
    "meanwhile , we solve the relativistic shock equation @xcite and obtain the speed of the shocked matters moving outwards , @xmath28^{1/2},\\\\",
    "\\frac{v_2}{c}=[\\frac{(p_2-p_1)(e_1+p_2)}{(e_2-e_1)(e_2+p_1)}]^{1/2}. \\label{equation : shock}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is velocity and @xmath30 stands for energy density .",
    "note that these values are derived in a coordinate system where the shock wave surface is at rest .",
    "subscript 1 and 2 represent corresponding values in regions 1 and 2 ( defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1:illustration ] ) , respectively . adopting the numerical solution of last good homology [ table 1 of @xcite ] and applying the radiation pressure of eq.([equation : prad ] ) to region 2",
    ", the velocity of the shock s propagation rate can be achieved by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the velocity in the inertial frame where the collapsing center is at rest .",
    "thus the velocity of region 2 in the center inertial frame can be obtained , @xmath33 finally , we obtain the velocity of the shocked matter ( about 0.1 speed of light ) and hence the expansion speed of the fireball .",
    "strange quark matter at high density and small temperature is expected to exhibit color - superconductivity ( csc ) , induced by quark pairing and condensation at the fermi surface , with energy gaps @xmath34100 mev @xcite and associated critical temperatures @xmath35 , above which thermal fluctuations destroy the condensate @xcite .",
    "if the density is sufficiently high , a color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase is the favored ground state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the surface emissivity of photons with energies below @xmath36 23mev ( @xmath37 : electromagnetic plasma frequency ) is strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , average photon energies in cfl matter at temperature @xmath5 are @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , when the surface temperature of the star drops below @xmath39 7.7mev , the photon emissivity can be considered shut off . as long as we know the cooling behavior , we can then estimate the timescale of radiation - dominated period .",
    "a nascent quark star is actually not an isothermal , homogeneous sphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal evolution is determined by the energy conservation and heat transport equations , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the specific heat of the star matter , @xmath42 is its thermal conductivity , @xmath43 is the neutrino emissivity , and @xmath44 is the heat flux at radius @xmath15 .    for normal quark matter @xcite",
    ", one has @xmath45 the heat capacity of the quark matter with color superconductivity ( cfl phase , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be @xmath46 { \\rm\\ , erg\\ , cm^{-3}\\ , k^{-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the energy gap and @xmath48 is the critical temperature , and the neutrino emissivity for this cfl state is @xcite , @xmath49 it is evident from eq.(7 ) and eq.(9 ) that the neutrino emissivity could be much lower in cfl state than in normal state of quark matter .",
    "low @xmath50-emissivity favors keeping a high surface temperature of cfl stars ( fig .",
    "2 ) , that helps to form an energetic fireball . according to @xcite , the conductivity in eq.([equation : cool ] ) reads @xmath51    in addition , we choose the following boundary conditions : at the center and the surface of the star , we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 . as for the initial condition , we assume the temperature of the star at @xmath54 be uniform , @xmath55 . the initial temperature of the new born strange star can be estimated to be tens of mev .",
    "once we input @xmath56 , eq.([equation : cool ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "we can then obtain radiation - dominated timescale and hence calculate the total work done by the fireball .",
    "in the calculation shown in fig .  [ fig2:cooling ] ,",
    "we find that the cooling rate of strange matter with csc is slower than that of normal quark matter , and with bigger energy gap , the csc matter cools faster . in about @xmath571 ms , the surface temperature of a cfl star will drop below 7.7 mev , the typical threshold of photon emission .",
    "the timescale of strong thermal radiation is adequately short , and thus we can safely use the assumption that the heating process in the thin layer in region 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig1:illustration ] will not influence much to the mechanism .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3:work ] we calculate the work done by radiation pressure with different pressure - radius relationships , i.e. different value of index @xmath18 in eq.(1 ) , and with different initial temperatures . it can be seen that , for a typical condition ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) , the work would exceed @xmath59 erg within radiation dominated timescale , which may result in a successful explosion . for different initial temperatures ,",
    "the work could pass @xmath23 erg once the initial temperature exceed about 40mev .",
    "note that the initial temperature could be ( 30 - 40 ) mev for normal neutron stars @xcite .",
    "more energy ( i.e. , both gravitation and phase - transition energies ) should be released for quark stars if the conjecture by @xcite is correct .",
    "unfortunately , it is still model - dependent to determine the real initial temperature of a quark star . from fig.3",
    ", we could conclude that the total work done by the fireball could be enough for successful supernova if the initial temperatures is greater than @xmath2 mev .",
    "a photon - driven mechanism is proposed for successful core - collapse supernovae , and bare strange quark stars are residues after the explosions .",
    "it is found through calculations that radiation pressure can push the overlying mantle away through photon - electron scattering with energy ( the work done by radiation pressure ) as much as @xmath1 erg , the typical energy needed for core - collapse supernovae .",
    "regarding the difference between nuclear matter and strange quark matter , a strange star can have a much higher surface temperature than a neutron star and accordingly a greater thermal photon emission .",
    "in addition , the strong electric field ( @xmath60 v / cm ) on quark surface should play an important role in producing the thermal emission too [ i.e. , the usov mechanism @xcite ] , which is in the same order of blackbody radiation when @xmath61 k. furthermore , this distinction results in a huge radiation pressure that leads to a much faster explosion than the conventional delayed - shock model .",
    "the photon - driven supernova may benefit not only from the radiation pressure but also a much smaller photo - dissociation effect while most part of the mantle is blown away before the iron - cores could ever interact with high energy photons , hence making it possible to provide sufficient energy and promote a successful explosion .",
    "low - mass bare strange stars could form via accretion - induce collapse of white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "a low energy budget is needed in this scenario since the gravitational binding energy of a white dwarf with approximate chandrasekhar mass is only @xmath62 erg .",
    "this photon - driven mechanism may also provide an alternative figure how a fireball can be produced during cosmic long - soft @xmath63ray bursts , which are observed associated with supernovae .",
    "it is worth noting that , due to the chromatic confinement of quark surfaces , the baryon contamination would be very low in such fireballs , that is necessary in the models @xcite .",
    "similar @xmath3-ray burst fireballs due to the color - flavor locked phase - transition as well as magnetic field decay were noted @xcite . it is worth noting that @xcite showed statistically that long - soft @xmath3-ray burst could be really related to supernova and that the asymmetry of bursts associated with supernova would cause the kick of pulsars .",
