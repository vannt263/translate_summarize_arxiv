    "the unified model for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) proposes the ubiquitous presence of an obscuring torus around their nuclei , with type 1 and type 2 agn being intrinsically similar ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "the central region of an agn ( including the broad emission line region , blr ) is obscured when viewed along directions close to the equatorial plane of the torus , and it is then classified as a type 2 agn . in type 1",
    "agn the viewing angle is close to the polar direction of the torus , and thus we have a direct view of the central engine .",
    "this model received strong support from the fact that broad lines have been revealed in the spectra of the polarized emission of a number of type 2 agn ( e.g. , antonucci & miller 1985 ; tran , miller , & kay 1992 ) .",
    "there is also indirect evidence of the presence of the dusty torus advocated by the unified model .",
    "first is the similarity of seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s with respect to a given isotropic indicator of the agn luminosity such as , [ o iii]@xmath115007 , infrared ( ir ) , hard x - ray , and radio luminosities of seyferts ( see e.g. , mulchaey et al . 1994 ; alonso - herrero , ward , & kotilainen 1997 ; nagar et al .",
    "the uv and soft x - ray continua of seyfert 2s , on the other hand are underluminous relative to the type 1s , because they are not transmitted through the torus .",
    "second , the presence of `` double - cone '' morphology of the narrow line region ( nlr ) structures ( e.g. , pogge 1989 ; wilson & tsvetanov 1996 ; schmitt et al .",
    "2003 ) , with orientations similar to those of radio jets ( nagar et al . 1999 and references therein ) , are interpreted as emission collimated by the torus .",
    "the role of the extinction produced by the host galaxy can not be understated ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "for instance , for some seyfert 2s broad lines are identified in the near - ir ( e.g. , blanco , ward , & wright 1990 ; ruiz , rieke , & schmidt 1994 ; goodrich et al .",
    "1994 ; veilleux , goodrich , & hill 1997 ; ramos almeida , prez - garca , & acosta - pulido 2009 ) , and counter - cones are seen in direct and/or polarized near - ir light ( e.g. , packham et al .",
    "1997 for ngc  1068 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2000 for circinus ) . finally , there is the tendency of intermediate types ( seyferts 1.8 + 1.9 ) to be hosted in edge - on galaxies ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ) .    in recent years",
    "much progress has been made toward understanding the properties of the molecular dusty torus . from the theoretical point of view , torus models with smooth density distributions ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1993 ; granato & danese 1994 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ) have been superseded by more complex clumpy dust distributions ( e.g. , nenkova , ivezic , & elitzur 2002 ; hnig et al .",

    "( 2003 ) showed that in general the dust in the nuclear regions of seyfert galaxies is on physical scales not associated with those of the dusty torus .",
    "it is then likely that this dust is located in front of the nucleus ( see also regan & mulchaey 1999 ) and arises from the galactic ism . in our sample ,",
    "circinus , ic  5063 , ngc  5506 , ngc  7582 , ngc  2110 , ngc  7172 , and possibly ngc  7674 show dust features in the nuclear ( central @xmath19 ) regions ( see e.g. , quillen et al .",

    "2006 ; roche et al . 2006 , 2007 : colling , roche , & mason 2009 ) .",
    "similarly , the spatially - resolved mid - ir polarimetric observations of ngc  1068 ( packham et al .",
    "2007 ) can be explained with a geometrically , and optically thick torus surrounded by a larger , more diffuse structure , associated with the dusty central regions of the host galaxy .",
    "roche et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that ngc  5506 and ngc  7172 , both with prominent nuclear dust lanes ( see e.g. , malkan et al .",
    "1998 ) , have similar absorbing columns as derived from x - ray observations and the @xmath20 m features , for the latter just by using a foreground dust screen model .",
    "this suggests that some of the extinction measured from the @xmath20 m silicate feature might arise in the galactic ism ( see also the discussion in section  2.1 , and figure  2 ) . in other words , in these two galaxies if the silicate feature were to come only from the torus , it would be shallower ( at it is filled in by emission from warm dust also in the torus ) . these findings",
    "would also be consistent with the work of guainazzi , matt , & perola ( 2005 ) who showed that the presence of dust lanes on scales of 100pc in compton - thin seyfert 2s is correlated with the x - ray obscuration , mostly in the x - ray column density range @xmath22 .",
    "this was interpreted by these authors as due to the larger covering fraction of the gas in the dust lanes , rather than the pc - scale dusty torus .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", clumpy dusty models can not produce very deep silicate features ( @xmath23 ( see nenkova et al . 2008b ; elitzur 2008 ; sirocky et al . 2008 ) , while observations show that many seyfert galaxies have relatively deep silicate features ( see shi et al .",
    "2006 ; hao et al . 2007 ; deo et al . 2009 ) . in our sample , this includes circinus , ngc  5506 , ngc  7582 , ngc  7172 ( see table  4 and figure  2 ) . by analogy with those ulirgs optically classified as type-2 agn and with deep silicate features modelled by sirocky et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the deep silicate features of some seyfert 2 galaxies in our sample may be explained by additional obscuration by cold foreground dust .    for simplicity we will consider the extended dust component as a purely foreground medium producing only absorption .",
    "we note however , that high angular resolution mid - ir spectroscopic observations of the ionization cone dust of ngc  1068 show evidence of components of both absorption and emission .",
    "we use the ir extinction curve of chiar & tielens ( 2006 ) of the local ism in the wavelength range @xmath24 m , which includes the two silicate features at 9.7 and @xmath25 m . for extinctions ( @xmath26mag ) the effects of foreground extinction",
    "can not be ignored , especially in the spectral region around the @xmath20 m silicate feature .",
    "finally , it is important to note the possible degeneracy between agn type and the effects of foreground extinction . using smooth density torus models alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2003 ) demonstrated that the reddened near - ir sed from a nearly face - on ( polar view ) torus ( underlying seyfert 1 ) looks similar to the intrinsic near - ir sed at a viewing angle closer to a true seyfert 2 ( equatorial view ) given sufficient levels of foreground extinction ( @xmath27mag ) .",
    "given this degeneracy in our fitting process we choose not to leave the foreground extinction as a free parameter ( see section  3.3 ) , but instead we use published values of the extinction as estimated from near - ir measurements .",
    "table  4 gives the values of the foreground extinction used in this work , only for galaxies with evidence of extended dust components and with @xmath27mag .",
    "the foreground extinction is applied to the torus emission , as well as to the agn emission that is included for galaxies with a direct view of the blr .",
    "the _ clumpy _ database now contains @xmath28 models , which are calculated for a fine grid of model parameters . to fit the data we take a bayesian approach to dealing with the inherent degeneracy of the torus model parameters ( see ra09 and ra11 )",
    ". in this work we use an updated version of the bayesclumpy code developed by asensio ramos & ramos almeida ( 2009 ) .",
    "this tool uses a bayesian inference to allow as much information as possible to be extracted from the observations .",
    "we refer the reader to asensio ramos & ramos almeida ( 2009 ) for details on the interpolation methods and algorithms used by bayesclumpy . however , it is important to note that in using a bayesian approach we do not make use of the original set of models of nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) , but rather of an interpolated version of them ( see figures 3 and 4 in asensio ramos & ramos almeida 2009 ) .",
    "the fineness of the grid of clumpy models makes interpolation an appropriate methodology for our studies .",
    "the new version of bayesclumpy allows , in addition to fitting photometric points , for the possibility of fitting spectra . in the case of photometric observations",
    ", bayesclumpy simulates the transmission curve of the corresponding filter on the model spectra . for the spectroscopic observations , the full information , flux and associated uncertainty , is used .",
    "when both photometric seds and spectroscopy are fitted together , we use the data uncertainties discussed in section  2 as weights for the fitting routine . under the assumption that the torus models are valid simultaneously for photometric and spectroscopic data and that the noise in all observed points is mutually uncorrelated",
    ", the bayesian approach is insensitive to the fact that there are many more spectroscopic points than photometric ones .",
    "the reason is that , apart from the possible regularization that can be included in the prior distributions , we sample the full posterior distribution and obtain marginalized posterior for each parameter .",
    "the marginalization procedure takes into account all possible values of the parameters producing good fits .",
    "this avoids the possible overfitting of the sed which is produced by neglecting the few photometric points .",

    "for these three galaxies we assumed gaussian distributions for this parameter with a width of 10 .",
    "in addition to the the six torus model parameters , there are two extra parameters that can be fitted or fixed . the first parameter accounts for the vertical displacement needed to match the fluxes of a given model to an observed sed / spectrum .",

    "then there is the question for agn with broad lines and foreground extinctions @xmath116mag of whether we are seeing agn emission in the range @xmath117 m or not .",
    "we thus decided for these galaxies to fit the data both including and not including the agn emission .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in section  4.2 .",
    "the result of the fitting process are the marginal posterior distributions for the six free parameters that describe the _ clumpy _ models plus the vertical shift .",
    "these are the probability distributions of each parameter , which are represented as histograms . as explained in section  3.1 , except for the viewing angle of five galaxies , for the rest of the parameters we use uniform priors .",
    "if the observational data contain sufficient information for the fit , then the resulting probability distributions of the fitted torus model parameters will clearly differ from uniform distributions . in those cases",
    "the probabilities either show trends or are centered at certain values within the considered intervals .    for each galaxy",
    "we translate the fitted torus model parameters into two model spectra .",
    "the first one corresponds to the maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) values that represent the `` best fit '' to the data .",
    "the second is the model produced with the median value of the probability distribution of each parameter , which is characteristic of the observed sed+spectroscopy data .",

    "this kind of two - dimensional distributions can be used to check for possible correlations and degeneracies between different torus model parameters for a given galaxy .",

    "2007 ) . since we could not find estimates for the host galaxy extinction , we used the foreground extinction derived from the x - ray column density and the standard galactic ratio @xmath118 ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) .",

    "not all type 1s are viewed at relatively low inclination angles and not all type 2 are seen at directions closer to the equatorial plane of the torus . however , as we shall see in section  5.2 , the relevant quantity for a galaxy to be classified as a type 1 or a type 2 is the probability for an agn produced photon to escape unabsorbed or not .    as can be seen from table  5 ,",
    "our results confirm that _ clumpy _ models of tori with relatively small radial thicknesses , produce good fits with no need for very large tori .",
    "the fitted values are within the assumed range of @xmath121 , and the data for most galaxies can be fitted with tori with radial thickness @xmath122 . in section  5.1",
    "we will compare in more detail our derived physical sizes of the torus ( in parsecs ) with those derived from the modeling of mid - ir interferometry .",
    "the index of the power law distribution @xmath123 controls the placement of clouds between the inner , hotter parts of the torus and the outer cooler regions ( nenkova et al .",
    "2008b ) , and thus plays a role in the shape of the ir sed ( see also hnig & kishimoto 2010 ) .",
    "the effects of changing @xmath123 on the _ clumpy _ models are easier to see in type 1 objects ( low values of @xmath0 ) . for steep radial distributions ( clouds concentrated near the inner radius of the torus )",
    "the near and mid - ir seds become redder ( see figure 9 of nenkova et al .",
    "2008b ) , although including the agn contribution always makes the model seds flatter .",
    "we find that the fitted values of @xmath123 for our seyfert 1s are relatively small .",
    "however the reverse for seyfert 2s ( seen at high inclinations ) is not necessarily true .",
    "we also note that the sensitivity of the sed to @xmath123 for very small values of @xmath1 is highly reduced .",
    "this is because for such small tori the sed does not change much whether the clouds are distributed along the whole extent of the torus ( @xmath124 ) or highly concentrated in its inner part ( large @xmath123 ) .",
    "this lack of sensitivity could result in posterior distributions that depend on the quality of the interpolation technique used by bayesclumpy .",
    "consequently , whenever the inferred @xmath1 is very small ( e.g. , ngc  1068 ) , the inferred value of @xmath123 should be treated with caution .    for a larger sample and using fits of the seds alone",
    "ra11 found statistically significant differences of @xmath123 between type 1s and type 2s .",

    "fits in the literature , we refer the reader to appendix  b.    as explained in section  3.3 , the shift applied to scale the _ clumpy _ models to the data is directly related to the bolometric luminosity of the agn . in this work we chose to leave the shift as a free parameter , but other works ( e.g. , mor et al .",

    "besides , the _ clumpy _ torus models never produce very deep silicate features , in contrast with smooth density models ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1993 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ) . when fitted together with the photometric seds we expect the silicate feature to be mostly sensitive to the optical depth of the clouds @xmath127 , and the average number of clouds along radial equatorial rays @xmath3 . as an illustration of the complicated behavior of the silicate feature in terms of the torus model parameters , we can see that galaxies of the same type and with similar apparent depths of the @xmath20 m silicate feature ( e.g. , type 1s ic  4329a and ngc  7469 , and type 2s mcg@xmath186 - 23 - 16 and ic  5063 , see hnig et al .",
    "2010 ) have different fitted values of @xmath3 and @xmath127 ( see table  5 , and appendix  a ) .",
    "a general result for our sample of seyfert galaxies is that the average number of clouds along radial equatorial rays is never very low , and is in the range @xmath191 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",

    "we also note here , that the values of the optical depth of the clouds @xmath127 in the corrected version of the models ( see nenkova et al .",

    "it appears as if to compensate for limited values of @xmath127 , the fits are achieved with more clouds along radial equatorial rays , close to the maximum value allowed by the models of @xmath192 .",
    "while for most seyferts in our sample _ clumpy _ torus models with a typical value of @xmath193 produced good fits to the data , the _ spitzer_/irs spectra of pg quasars were well fitted with torus models containing a mean value of @xmath194 ( mor et al .",

    "the optical depths of our sample of seyferts show a broad distribution , @xmath197 , with no obvious dependence on other torus model parameters or agn type ( see also mor et al .",

    "the ir data of the pg quasars studied by mor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) were fitted with @xmath199 ( mor et al .",

    "we also compare the fits done with sed+spectroscopy ( blue lines and blue shaded regions ) and seds alone ( orange lines and orange shaded regions ) , except in cases of sparse seds .",
    "some of our galaxies are in common with the works of ramos almeida et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "we have redone the sed alone fits for those galaxies to use consistent errors with our work . in general",
    "we find that the main difference is that fits to seds alone tend to infer broader probability distributions of these torus model parameters ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "in particular , for galaxies with low foreground extinctions the fits with seds alone when compared to the fits with sed+spectroscopy produce compatible values ( within the @xmath108 values of the probability distributions ) of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 .",
    "most disagreements in the fitted parameters tend to occur for @xmath3 , @xmath123 , and @xmath127 . some of these differences are explicable .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 and @xmath123 may trade off to yield an approximately constant number of clouds in the inner region . also , the optical depth of the individual clouds @xmath127 and the average number of clouds along an equatorial ray @xmath3 have a strong influence on the depth of the @xmath20 m silicate feature and the shape of the @xmath200 m emission . note also that the sed alone fits of some _ pure _ type 1 seyferts always tend to produce the @xmath20 m silicate feature in emission ( see figure  4 ) , while the observations show an almost featureless spectrum ( ic  4329a , ngc  3227 ) or the feature slightly in emission ( ngc  4151 ) . for the seyfert 2s with low host galaxy foreground extinction",
    "there is a better agreement for these two parameters between fits with and without mid - ir spectroscopy .",
    "the other important fact to note is that including mid - ir spectroscopy helps assess whether there is an important contribution from extended dust structures causing absorption ( and possibly emission too ) .",
    "this is clearly the case for circinus , ngc  5506 , ngc  7172 and ngc  7582 , which have relatively deep silicate features .",
    "indeed , the fits to the seds alone of seyfert 2s of ra09 , which were done without foreground extinction , only predicted moderately deep silicate features for these galaxies .",
    "however , we reiterate that it is not always possible to produced good simultaneous fits to the seds and spectroscopy of seyferts with deep silicate features even when the host galaxy foreground extinction is included .",
    "it is possible that for the seyfert galaxies with the deepest silicate features a clumpy medium in a torus - like configuration may not be appropriate to explain the observations ( see e.g. , levenson et al .",
    "in this section we discuss the two torus model parameters that can be compared with observations , the torus size and the angular width .    for each agn , using the @xmath1 parameter and the bolometric luminosity of the system derived from the fits , and equation  1 we computed the physical radius @xmath134 of the torus .",
    "we used the median value of the fitted torus radial thickness @xmath1 and agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "as can be seen from table  6 the torus radii derived from our fits to the sed+spectroscopy are between @xmath201 and 6pc .",
    "our fitted physical sizes are consistent with the mid - ir interferometric results that the torus is relatively compact ( tristram et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; burstscher et al . 2009 ; raban et al . 2009 ) .",
    "before we compare the torus radii with the @xmath202 m sizes inferred from mid - ir interferometric observations , it is necessary to discuss some caveats .",
    "first , the modelling of the @xmath202 m interferometric observations requires structures on different physical scales , as demonstrated for circinus and ngc  1068 ( see tristram et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; raban et al .",
    "2009 , and table  1 ) .",
    "however , the fwhm sizes of the cooler , more extended component could still be compared with model predictions .",
    "second , nenkova et al . ( 2008b ) showed that for tori with @xmath203 and various viewing angles , at @xmath202 m @xmath204 of the total flux is enclosed within angular radii of @xmath205 . here",
    "@xmath206 is the angular size at the inner radius of the torus .",
    "this is because the @xmath202 m emission traces warm dust , with @xmath207k , and is rather insensitive to cooler material further from the nuclei .",
    "finally the _ compact _ dusty torus is expected to blend into the galaxy disk ( e.g. , shi et al .",
    "2006 ; packham et al . 2007 ;",
    "nenkova et al .",
    "2008b ) , and thus deriving the true size of the torus might not be straightforward .    with these considerations in mind , we can compare the sizes derived from the modelling of the @xmath202 m interferometric data may not be appropriate .",
    "however , values of @xmath1 larger than the @xmath202 m sizes from interferometric observations are a necessary , although not sufficient , condition for consistency between our modelling and the interferometric results .",
    "there are estimates of the @xmath202 m physical size of the torus through mid - ir interferometry for six galaxies in our sample ( see table  1 for sizes and corresponding references ) .",
    "we find a relatively good agreement , within a factor of two , between the fitted torus sizesm sizes ( fwhm ) from mid - ir interferometric observations , the @xmath134 values given in table  6 need to be multiplied by two . ] and the sizes inferred from mid - ir interferometry .",
    "the galaxy with the largest discrepancy is ngc  7469 .",
    "tristram et al .",
    "( 2009 ) inferred @xmath208pc , whereas our fitted torus size is about 5pc .",
    "we note however , that the interferometric observations of ngc  7469 were affected by large uncertainties in the determination of the total flux that may have compromised the derived physical size of the torus of this galaxy .",
    "the torus model width of the angular distribution of the clouds , @xmath2 , is related to the opening angle of the ionization cones , @xmath209 .",
    "the latter can be measured from emission line images , usually [ o iii]@xmath115007 and/or h@xmath112 .",
    "table  1 gives the measured opening angles ( measured from the polar direction ) for our sample and corresponding references .",
    "it is important to note that this comparison is not straightforward because the relation between the true opening angle of the cone and the measured opening angle from line emission depends on the gas distribution . for thin gas disks , mulchaey , wilson , & tsvetanov ( 1996 ) simulations",
    "showed that cone - shaped emission can be produced for most viewing angles and that the observed angles are less than the true opening angle .",
    "we can try to make this comparison for galaxies with the observed widest ionization cones , for which we can set more meaningful upper limits to the widths of the torus .",
    "for the two galaxies with @xmath210 ( ngc  5506 and ngc  7582 , table  1 ) the fitted @xmath2 are compatible with the approximate limits set by the observations ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "note however , the difficulties encountered for fitting the observations of these galaxies ( section  4.2 )",
    ".      one of most salient properties of the clumpy torus models is that there is always a finite probability for an obscured view of the agn , irrespective of the viewing angle ( nenkova et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "while in the simplest version of the unified model type 1s would be observed in directions closer to the pole of the torus ( low values of @xmath0 ) than type 2s , in a clumpy medium this is not necessarily so .",
    "indeed , it is possible to have a type 1 viewed at a relatively high @xmath0 provided that the width of the angular size of the torus is small ( for a given @xmath3 ) , as is the case for ngc  4151 and ic  4329a .",
    "note that two - dimensional posterior distributions of these two galaxies show that the fitted values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are inversely correlated ( figures  b3 and b4 in the appendix . )",
    "seyfert 2s can also be viewed from any angle , as long as there is at least one cloud along the line of sight .",
    "the probability of encountering a cloud is higher for increasing values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that not all type 2s in our sample require very broad angular distributions ( large @xmath2 , e.g. , ngc  1068 in figure  9 ) , suggests that @xmath3 and @xmath0 must be high in those cases . in figure  9",
    "the error bars reflect the @xmath108 uncertainty around the median of the probability distributions of the fitted parameters .",
    "a more relevant quantity for an agn to be classified as a type 1 or a type 2 is the probability for an agn - produced photon to escape unabsorbed ( equation  3 ) .",
    "since the escape probability is a highly non - linear function of @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 , we took full advantage of our bayesian approach .",
    "we thus generated the posterior distributions for @xmath135 from the posterior distributions of the relevant fitted parameters given in table  5 .",
    "as can be seen from the values in table  6 , all _ pure _ type 1s and type 2s have respectively , relatively high ( @xmath212 ) and low ( @xmath213 ) agn escape probabilities , as expected .",
    "the type 2 seyferts with broad - lines detected in the near - ir show a range of escape probabilities .",
    "we note that these probabilities do not include the effects of foreground extinction .",
    "observational ( e.g. , simpson 2005 ) and theoretical ( e.g. , hnig & beckert 2007 ) arguments provide evidence of the so - called receding torus ( lawrence 1991 ) . in this scenario",
    "the higher fraction of type 1 agn at high agn luminosities is explained in terms of a decreasing covering factor of the torus .",
    "furthermore , hnig & beckert ( 2007 ) and nenkova et al . ( 2008b ) argued that the decreasing fraction of type 2s at high luminosities not only arises from decreasing @xmath2 , but also from decreasing @xmath3 , or both .    in this work we calculated two different covering factors using our bayesian approach",
    "the first one is the geometrical covering factor @xmath138 , which does not depend on the viewing angle , and is derived by integrating the agn escape probability ( equation  3 ) over all angles as put forward by mor et al .",
    "if we define @xmath214 , then : @xmath215    a related quantity is the the ratio between the torus luminosity integrated over the entire wavelength range covered by the torus models ( @xmath216 m ) and the inferred agn bolometric luminosity :    @xmath217    this ratio is the _ apparent _ covering factor ( see mor et al .",
    "2009 ) , because it depends on the viewing angle @xmath0 ( as well as on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , and can be understood as a reprocessing efficiency .",
    "as we did for @xmath218 we generated the posterior distributions for @xmath138 and @xmath137 from the posterior distributions of the relevant fitted parameters given in table  5 .",
    "the median values and the @xmath108 values of the distributions of the geometrical covering factor and reprocessing efficiencies of our sample of seyferts are given in table  6 .",
    "the galaxies in our sample show a range of reprocessing efficiencies , although in general there is no clear dependency with any torus model parameters .",
    "in contrast , the torus geometrical covering factor @xmath138 appears to depend on the agn bolometric luminosity , as can be seen from figure  10 ( left panel ) .",
    "we also included in this comparison high luminosity agn .",
    "these are pg quasars , for which mor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) computed the torus @xmath138 from @xmath3 and @xmath10 as inferred from fits to _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectroscopy .",
    "we note that these authors also used the nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) torus models , but added extra components to fit their data ( see section  4.1 ) .",
    "mor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) calculated the pg quasars agn bolometric luminosities using the observed optical luminosities ( see mor et al .",
    "2009 for more details ) . for our sample of seyfert galaxies the uncertainties in @xmath138 take into account the @xmath108 values around the median of the probability distribution of @xmath2 . when combining the pg quasars of mor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and our sample of seyferts , there is a tendency for the torus covering factor @xmath138 to decrease from @xmath219 at low agn luminosities ( @xmath220 ) to @xmath221 at high luminosities ( @xmath222 )",
    ". such tendency for the torus covering factor to decrease with the bolometric luminosity of the agn was already noted for pg quasars by mor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) when including an additional hot black - body component to fit their data .",
    "a similar trend may also be present when comparing @xmath2 vs. @xmath128 , with high luminosity agn having narrower cloud angular distributions ( figure  10 , right panel ) than low luminosity ones .",
    "we also found in section  4 that on average seyfert galaxies ( with bolometric luminosities in the range @xmath223 ) are fitted with more clouds along a radial equatorial ray than pg quasars ( bolometric luminosities @xmath222 ) .",
    "given these trends , it is not surprising that the torus geometrical covering factor @xmath138 , which depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath2 , tends to be lower in the most luminous objects in our sample than in the less luminous ones .",
    "the decreased torus covering factor at high agn luminosities may provide some support for a receding torus at high luminosities .",
    "we note however , that in these comparisons there are few type 2 objects at high agn luminosities , so we can not rule out a possible dependency of @xmath2 with the agn type .",
    "that is , type 2s might have wider tori than type 1s as suggested by the results of ra11 .",
    "finally a note of caution .",
    "a large fraction of the low luminosity agn in our sample with wide angular cloud distributions are in highly inclined galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude the possibility that contamination from extended dust features not directly related to the dusty torus has resulted in large fitted values of @xmath2 .",
    "finally , as we explained in section  2.1 , our sample is not complete , and may not be representative , and thus this result needs to be explored for a complete sample .",

    "these three galaxies show evidence of extended dust structures on tens of parsec scales , not directly related to the dusty torus .",

    "( 2008b ) models were also able to produce good fits to mid - ir high angular resolution spectroscopy , in terms of the shape of the silicate feature and continuum slope and not only the apparent strength of the feature . when combined with the photometric seds , the mid - ir spectroscopy allowed us to constrain the number of clouds along radial equatorial rays @xmath3 and the optical depth of the individual clouds @xmath127 .",
    "we find that the tori of seyfert galaxies have typically @xmath230 , and the optical depth of the clouds are in the range @xmath231 . by comparison",
    "the tori of pg quasars ( @xmath232 ) appear to contain fewer clouds along radial equatorial rays , typically @xmath233 , with optical depths of @xmath234 ( mor et al .",

    "for instance , type 2s tend to be viewed at directions closer to the equatorial plane of the torus , but small values of @xmath0 are permitted as long as there is one cloud along the los .",
    "this is because in clumpy media , there is always a finite probability for an agn photon to escape absorption , and this probability is a function of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . from our fits",

    "we found that high luminosity agn ( @xmath238 ) tend to have lower torus covering factors ( @xmath239 because they have narrower tori ( smaller @xmath10 ) and contain fewer clouds along radial equatorial rays @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast lower luminosity ones ( at @xmath240 ) tend to have high covering factors ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "this might explain the decreased observed fraction of type 2 agn at high luminosities .",
    "we note however , that this result may be subject to some caveats .",
    "in particular most of the agn in our sample at the low end of @xmath241 are hosted in highly inclined galaxies , and it is possible that contamination by extended dust components not related to the dusty torus results in larger fitted values of @xmath2 .",
