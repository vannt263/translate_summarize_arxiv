    "the origin and evolution of life as we know it are tightly related to the chemistry of complex carbon - bearing molecules .",
    "while the transition from macromolecules to the simplest living organisms has likely proceeded on earth , we do not know yet organic molecules of what complexity have been available during build - up phase of the primordial / secondary earth atmosphere and oceans . during the last few decades a multitude of species , including alcohols ( e.g. ch@xmath1oh ) , ethers ( e.g. ch@xmath1och@xmath1 ) , acids ( e.g. hcooh ) have been discovered in interstellar space , with atomic masses up to a few hundred ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "a precursor of amino acids , amino acetonitrile , and the simplest sugar , glycolaldehyde , have been found toward the star - forming region sagittarius b2(n ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , many simple `` blocks '' of prebiotic molecules do exist in space .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens to these species during the prestellar / hot core phase , passage of an accretion shock , and inside a protoplanetary disk .",
    "are organic molecules present in large amounts in circumstellar disks at the verge of planet formation ?",
    "could they form and survive in such a harsh environment as an accretion disk ?    despite the variety of `` interstellar '' molecules , only formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) and a few other non - organic species have been detected and spatially resolved with interferometers in several nearby protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these multi - molecule , multi - transition studies allowed to constrain basic disk parameters like radii , masses , kinematics , temperature and density profiles , ionization degree and depletion factors ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dartois et  al .  2003),@xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* qi et  al .  2006 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pitu et  al .",
    "2007),@xcite ) . using advanced chemical models and indirect observational evidence",
    ", one can get a clue about the presence of other , yet undetected organic molecules in disks and estimate their abundances .",
    "it is commonly believed now that the formation of complex ( organic ) molecules starts already in cold dense cloud cores on dust grain surfaces serving as catalysts for many exothermic reactions between radicals and light atoms , with formaldehyde being one of the precursors for complex organic molecules .",
    "the newly produced species can be eventually returned into the gas phase either during the slow heat - up phase after the formation of a central star ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* garrod & herbst 2006 ) ) or due to some thermal / non - thermal desorption mechanisms , like cosmic rays / x - rays / uv heating of grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "transformation of a cloud into an actively accreting disk caused by gravitational collapse and angular momentum transport further modifies the composition of gas and dust as it passes through a shock front ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , dynamical transport in accretion disks can also be efficient for enriching the gas with complex species through evaporation of icy mantles in warmer , less opaque regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the uv radiation from the star and interstellar radiation field plays a major role in disk chemistry by dissociating and ionizing molecules , and heating the gas above the midplane where many molecular lines get excited ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "disk chemistry by itself can lead to the production of complex organic molecules .",
    "the recent detection of neii line emission from several protoplanetary disks by _ spitzer _ ( @xcite ) supports theoretical predictions of @xcite that the upper disk parts can be ionized and heated by the intense x - ray radiation from a young star .",
    "this thermal bremsstrahlung radiation is likely produced in reconnection loops in stellar corona at a distance of up to 0.1  au from the star and is capable of penetrating deeply into the disk inner region  the zone where planets form ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this x - ray radiation ionizes helium atoms , which destroy co and replenish thedisk gas with ionized atomic carbon .",
    "this leads to the formation of heavy cyanopolyynes and long carbon chains , partly on grain surfaces , which may lock a significant fraction of elemental carbon in the inner disk region ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* semenov et  al .  2004 ) ) .",
    "thus it is of utter importance to reveal which mechanisms and processes are important during various stages of protoplanetary disk evolution , using advanced theoretical modeling and high - quality observational data .    in the framework of the `` chemistry in disks '' ( cid ) collaboration between groups in heidelberg , bordeaux , paris and jena ,",
    "we have initiated a program to study and characterize chemical evolution and physical properties of nearby protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars of various masses and ages ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . among the various goals of the project ,",
    "we searched for emission lines of precursors for complex organic molecules and detected and resolved the disk around the low - mass star dm tau in the h@xmath0co(3 - 2 ) line with the plateau de bure interferometer ( though with modest snr of @xmath2 ) .",
    "we found that the h@xmath0co emission is not centrally peaked as is the dust continuum , but shows an asymmetric , ring - like structure with a large inner `` hole '' of @xmath3  au .",
    "the high - resolution observations of dm tau with the iram interferometer by @xcite and @xcite did not reveal the presence of central depression either in co lines or in dust continuum . in this contribution",
    "we review our current knowledge about chemistry in disks and predict that the h@xmath0co inner hole , if it really exists , should likely be caused by _",
    "chemical effects _ , which we will discuss in the paper .",
    "up to now more than 150 molecules have been discovered in space . among them",
    "only a small fraction have been detected in planet - forming disks with the aid of millimeter interferometry : co and its isotopes , cn , hcn , dcn , hnc , h@xmath0co , c@xmath0h , cs , hco@xmath4 , h@xmath5co@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 , and n@xmath0h@xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a few bright and large disks like surrounding dm tau , lkca  15 , and mwc  480 have been investigated in detail in a dozen of molecular transition and dust continuum .",
    "combined analysis of these line and continuum data allowed us to derive disk sizes , orientation , kinematics , distribution of temperature , surface density , and molecular column densities ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dartois et  al .",
    "2003 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* qi et  al .  2006),@xcite , ( * ? ?",
    "* pitu et  al .  2007 ) ) .",
    "the lines of the abundant co molecule serve as a probe of disk geometry as well as thermal structure and surface density distribution and kinematics . due to selective photodissociation , disks appear increasingly larger in the dust continuum and the c@xmath6o , @xmath5co , and @xmath7co lines , with a typical radius of @xmath8 3001000  au ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important finding is the presence of vertical temperature gradients in many disks , as predicted by physical models , while a few disks with large inner cavities do not show evidence for such a gradient ( e.g. , gm  aur ) .",
    "furthermore , disks around hotter herbig",
    "ae / be stars are systematically warmer than those around cool sun - like t tau stars .",
    "recently , @xcite have found that the observed intensity ratios of the co low- to high - level lines in the tw  hya disks require an additional heating source , which could be the x - ray stellar radiation .",
    "the observed lines of c@xmath0h , cn , and hcn are sensitive to the properties of the impinging uv radiation , in particular to the fraction of the total uv luminosity emitted in the ly@xmath9 line ( @xcite ) . the observed ratio of the cn to hcn column densities in disks is typical of photon - dominated chemistry , as predicted by the chemical models ( chapillon et al .",
    "2008 , in prep . ) .",
    "molecular ions ( hco@xmath4 and n@xmath0h@xmath4 ) are the dominant charge carriers at intermediate disk heights and their observations allowed to constrain the ionization fraction in these regions , with a typical value of @xmath10 ( @xcite )",
    ". the observed ratios of dco@xmath4 to hco@xmath4 and dcn to hcn column densities have much higher d / h value than the cosmic abundance of @xmath11 and thus deuterium fractionation is effective in disks ( @xcite ) .    in general",
    ", the observed molecular abundances are lower by factors 5100 in protoplanetary disks compared to the values in taurus molecular cloud , likely due to efficient freeze - out and photodissociation .",
    "a puzzling observational fact is that a significant reservoir of very cold co and hco@xmath4 gas exists in the disks of dm  tau and lkca  15 , at temperatures @xmath12 13 - 17  k , which are below the freeze - out temperature of co ( 20  k ) .",
    "conventional chemical models can not explain this fact without invoking a non - thermal desorption mechanism that works in the dark disk midplane , like efficient turbulent diffusion and uv - photodesorption driven by cosmic ray particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations of dust thermal emission at ( sub- ) millimeter and centimeter wavelengths are used to measure the slope of the wavelength dependence of the dust opacities that is a sensitive indicator of grain growth and sedimentation in disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is strong evidence that in many evolved disks , with ages of a few myrs , dust grains grow until at least pebble - like sizes .",
    "the results from the _ infrared space observatory _ and _ spitzer _ reveal the presence of a significant amount of frozen material and a rich variety of amorphous and crystalline silicates and pahs in disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pah emission features at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths are excited by the incident stellar radiation field and as such depend on disk vertical structure and turbulent state ( @xcite ) .",
    "these lines are more easily observed in disks around hot , intermediate - mass herbig ae / be stars as compared to cool , sun - like t tauri stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "various solid - state bands observed at 1030@xmath13 m in emission belong to amorphous and crystalline silicates at @xmath14  k with varying fe / mg ratios and grain topology / sizes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the composition of the hot gas in the inner disk as traced by ro - vibrational emission lines from co , co@xmath0 , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , hcn and recently h@xmath0o and oh , suggests that complex chemistry driven by endothermic reactions is at work there ( @xcite ) . at larger distances from the star",
    "the disk becomes colder and most of these molecules stick to dust grain , forming icy mantles .",
    "the main mantle component is water ice with trace amount of other more volatile materials like co , co@xmath0 , nh@xmath1 , ch@xmath15 , h@xmath0co , hcooh and ch@xmath1oh ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical relative abundances of these minor constituents are about 0.510% of that of water .",
    "further above , a hot , highly ionized disk atmosphere is located , where only the simplest radicals and ions ( apart from h@xmath0 ) survive . this is the region where ionized carbon is abundant and c@xmath4 emission lines are excited.,width=240 ]    the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks has been investigated in detail by using robust chemical models ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * semenov et  al .",
    "2004),@xcite ) .",
    "the current theoretical picture based on a steady - state prescription of the disk structure divides the disk into three zones , see fig  [ scheme ] .",
    "before planets have formed and disk gas is dispersed , the dense midplane is well shielded from stellar and interstellar high - energy radiation . while its inner part can be heated up by accretion , the outer zone is cold , @xmath16  k. the only ionization sources are cosmic ray particles and decay of short - living radionuclides , and thus matter remains almost neutral , with a low degree of turbulence .",
    "the molecular complexity in the midplane is determined by ion - molecule and surface reactions , with most molecules sitting on the grains .",
    "adjacent to the midplane a warmer zone is located , which is partly shielded from stellar and interstellar uv / x - ray radiation . the complex cycling between efficiently formed gas - phase molecules , accretion onto dust surfaces , rapid surface reactions , and non - negligible desorption result in a rich chemistry ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "the inner part ( @xmath17  au ) of this region in the disks around t tauri stars can be substantially ionized by stellar x - ray radiation . the intermediate molecular layer is sufficiently dense ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) to excite most of the observed emission lines . atop a hot and heavily irradiated surface layer is located , where c@xmath4 , light hydrocarbons , their ions , and other radicals like c@xmath0h and cn are able to survive .",
    "this is the region where pah and silicate emission features are produced .",
    "here we discuss a puzzling observation of a putative h@xmath0co inner cavity in the disk of dm  tau . the plateau de bure interferometric image of the dm tau disk at the 1.5@xmath20 resolution in the h@xmath0co ( 3@xmath21 - 2@xmath21 ) line is shown in fig .",

    "we utilize a 1 + 1d flared disk model which is similar to the model of @xcite with a vertical temperature gradient .",
    "the dust grains are modeled as compact amorphous silicate spheres of uniform 0.1  @xmath13 m radius , with the opacity data taken from @xcite and a dust - to - gas mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the accretion rate is assumed to be @xmath22yr@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the disk outer radius is 8000  au .",
    "we focus on the observable disk structure beyond the radius of @xmath25  au .",
    "the total disk mass is 0.07@xmath26 and the disk age is 5  myr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pitu et  al .  2007 ) ) .",

    "destruction of formaldehyde has important consequences for organic chemistry .",
    "the x - ray chemical model leads to the clearing of an inner hole of @xmath3  au radius in all chemically related co - bearing species , including hco@xmath4 , by converting gas - phase co into heavier co@xmath0-containing and chain - like hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "in contrast to co , these heavier species are locked on dust surfaces in the inner disk region , where temperatures are lower than about 35 - 50  k ( fig .  [ dm_tau_mod ] , solid line ) .",
