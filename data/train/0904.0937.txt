    "probing the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) constitutes the prime mandate of the cern lhc , a proton - proton collider set to operate at @xmath13 tev .",
    "unprecedented efforts are going to be invested not only for the search for the sm higgs boson , but also for exploring other avenues which can successfully trigger ewsb . among them , supersymmetry and extra - dimension stand out as two potential rulers of the tera - electron - volt regime , which is the region of energies and distances to be unplugged at the lhc .",
    "although string models are intrinsically extra - dimensional , the phenomenological implications of extra dimensions were first studied in the context of a scenario @xcite in which gravity propagates in a compact and flat millimeter size ( @xmath14 ev ) extra - dimensional bulk with the sm particles confined to a 4d brane .",
    "the fundamental planck scale is then brought down to around a tev making it accessible to the collider experiments .",
    "subsequently , the concept of a ` fat - brane ' was introduced @xcite in which the sm particles are not strictly confined to a point in the extra dimension but travel within the size of the brane , which may be considered as a bulk of much smaller compactified dimension . in the present analysis , we attempt to extract possible signals of such fat - brane scenarios at the lhc , when the size of the brane is order tev .    studies based on a scenario in which only the sm gauge bosons access the bulk",
    "while the fermions are confined to a 4d brane @xcite reveal that @xmath8 can not be below 1 - 2 tev .",
    "the bound originates from several considerations : drell - yan processes in hadron colliders @xcite , @xmath15 at lep2 @xcite , electroweak precision tests @xcite , etc . because the fermions are treated differently from the bosons , such scenarios are called nonuniversal extra - dimensional models ( nued ) . on the other hand , in what is called the universal extra - dimensional model ( ued ) @xcite , where _ all _ the sm particles access the extra dimension , the constraint is not that tight .",
    "ued is relatively easy to motivate compared to nued as one does not have to selectively confine the sm fields in a 4d brane .",
    "one crucial difference between ued and nued is that the quantized momentum along the extra space direction , conventionally labeled by the kk number , is conserved for the former but not for the latter .",
    "thus while in nued the kk states mediate processes such as @xmath16 at tree level incurring very strong experimental constraints , in ued the kk states appear only in loops resulting in milder bounds .",
    "moreover , one - loop processes in nued are ultraviolet divergent while in ued they are finite @xcite .",
    "analysis of constraints on ued from @xmath17 of the muon @xcite , flavor changing neutral currents @xcite , @xmath18 decay @xcite , the @xmath19 parameter @xcite , hadron collider studies @xcite , all reveal that @xmath20 gev",
    ". consideration of @xmath21 , however , implies a somewhat tighter bound ( @xmath22 gev @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , ued should be perceived more as a bare structure with a basic minimum on top of which further details can be attributed to build separate models for addressing different issues .",
    "several implications of ued have already been investigated from the perspective of high energy experiments , phenomenology , string theory , cosmology , and astrophysics . to name a few",
    ", such tev scale flat extra - dimensional scenarios can provide a cosmologically viable dark matter candidate @xcite , address the issue of fermion mass hierarchy from a different angle @xcite , tev . when this universality is sacrificed , e.g. in an attempt to address the fermion hierarchy problem @xcite , kk gauge bosons pick up tree level couplings with different generation of fermions leading to large flavor - changing neutral currents and cp violation .",
    "such scenarios cease to be of any relevance at the tev scale , as considerations of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 push the lower limit on @xmath8 to around 5000 tev @xcite . ]",
    "interpret the higgs as a quark composite leading to a successful ewsb without the necessity of a fundamental yukawa interaction @xcite , and lower the unification scale down to a few tens of a tev @xcite . in the supersymmetric context ,",
    "a new mechanism of supersymmetry breaking related to compactification has been advanced @xcite , which at the same time ameliorates the hierarchy problem that an otherwise non - supersymmetric set - up suffers from .",
    "furthermore , the upper limit of the lightest supersymmetric neutral higgs has been shown to be relaxed @xcite .",
    "our present analysis is , however , based on a non - supersymmetric set - up .",
    "let us now get into the specifics of ued .",
    "there is a single flat extra dimension ( @xmath26 ) , compactified on an @xmath27 orbifold , and accessed by all the sm particles @xcite . from a 4d point of view , each field will have an infinite tower of kk modes , the zero modes being identified as the sm states .",
    "the orbifolding is essential to ensure that fermion zero modes have a chiral representation .",
    "but it has other consequences too .",
    "first _ , the physical region along the extra direction @xmath26 is now smaller [ @xmath28 than the periodicity [ @xmath29 , so the kk number ( @xmath1 ) is no longer conserved .",
    "what remains actually conserved is the even - ness and odd - ness of the kk states , ensured through the conservation of kk parity , defined by @xmath30 .",
    "_ secondly _ , lorentz invariance is also lost due to compactification , and as a result the kk masses receive bulk and orbifold - induced radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the bulk corrections are finite and nonzero only for bosons .",
    "the orbifold corrections , which vary logarithmically with the cutoff , depend on group theoretic invariants , as well as yukawa and quartic scalar couplings of the gauge and matter kk fields and hence are flavor - dependent .",
    "this induces a mass splitting among the different flavors of the same kk level , further to what has already been caused by the different zero mode masses .",
    "typically , if @xmath4 gev , the lightest among the @xmath2 kk states turns out to be @xmath31 weighing slightly above 500 gev , just above lie the kk leptons and weak bosons in the region of 500 - 550 gev , further up are the kk quarks near 600 gev , and at the peak the kk gluon ( the heaviest ) hovers around 650 gev .",
    "possibility of detection of ued kk states has already been studied in the context of hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "two distinct scenarios have been investigated : ( i ) the kk states are stable within the size of the detector ( the radiative origin of splitting was not considered here ) ; ( ii ) although @xmath31 is the lightest kk state ( considering the radiative splitting ) , the kk number violating interaction at the brane - bulk interface makes it decay within the detector to a photon and a graviton ( missing particle ) . in either of the two options , a lower limit of 350 - 400 gev was set on the mass of kk quarks and gluon from tevatron run - i data , while the run - ii data improved the limit to 500 gev .",
    "it was anticipated that lhc would either discover such states or at least push the limit to about 3 tev .",
    "another approach was followed in @xcite , where the kk states could decay into zero mode states by kk number violation , and a reach of 3 tev for kk quarks and gluon was envisaged with @xmath32 fb luminosity at the lhc .    although the broad framework within which we work in this paper is the same ued as pursued in @xcite and @xcite , we differ in some details of the model . as a result ,",
    "our final states are different from theirs , and hence a comparison of these analyses is not straightforward . throughout , we strictly adhere to the conservation of the kk number at all _ tree level _ vertices and kk parity to all order .",
    "this means that our @xmath31 is stable .",
    "then , once the kk states are produced , the decay patterns and branching ratios are decided depending on the relative amount of radiative splittings among the different @xmath2 kk modes .",
    "the end products are ( at least ) two @xmath31 , carrying away missing energy , plus the sm zero modes .",
    "note , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for generic kk quark and kk electroweak gauge boson , respectively .",
    "when both particles at the production vertex are kk quarks / gluons , although the cross section is very high , nonetheless , the final states following their decays contain more than one jet making way to very large sm backgrounds .",
    "on the other hand , if both parent kk particles are color neutral , the final states are hadronically quiet with significantly reduced sm background but the overall signal production cross section turns out to be quite low .",
    "therefore , we focus on the production of the mixed combination , namely @xmath36 , which is optimally balanced from the signal and background perspectives . following the decay chain , we are led to the following final state configuration : _ only one _ jet , @xmath37 number of leptons ( @xmath37 could be zero to four ) , and two @xmath31 ( missing energy ) . this is a path so far not travelled in the hunt for kk states in a hadronic machine .",
    "as we will see , for @xmath38 500 gev this signal can be comprehensively deciphered from the sm background with modest integrated luminosities by designing suitable kinematic cuts .",
    "it is important to mention at this stage that although ued and supersymmetry are structurally very different theories , ironically , their collider signatures tantalizingly mimic each other @xcite .",
    "possible methods of distinction of ued signals from supersymmetry , mainly based on spin studies , have been carried out both in the context of the lhc @xcite and the ( future ) linear collider @xcite .",
    "these discriminations require accurate theoretical tools with advanced monte carlos offering high sensitivity to small deviation . in this work",
    ", we do not intend to entertain such multiple possibilities of what might lie at this hazy domain across the new frontier . rather , we consider ued as the only new physics and intend to isolate its signals from possible sm background . mainly because of this working hypothesis ,",
    "a parton - level monte carlo that we employ is good enough for our simulation .",
    "we observe that following our strategy kk states can be spotted at the lhc for @xmath8 all the way up to 700@xmath39800 gev for an integrated luminosity of 100@xmath39300 @xmath40 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce ued , write down the mode expansions of different fields , and give an estimation of the radiative corrections to different kk masses . in the subsequent section",
    ", we discuss the production of a first level kk quark in association with the kk gauge bosons and their different decay chains .",
    "then , we discuss the relative efficiency of background elimination by looking for signals with different number of leptons in the final state . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize and conclude .",
    "the extra coordinate @xmath26 is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath41 with a @xmath42 orbifolding identifying @xmath26 with @xmath43 .",
    "the orbifolding is essential for generating zero mode _",
    "chiral _ fermions .",
    "after the @xmath26-dependence is integrated out , the 4d lagrangian contains the zero mode and the kk modes of different fields .",
    "let us now take a look at the kk mode expansions of these fields . since @xmath42 is a symmetry of the theory , each 5d field must be either even or odd under this discrete parity .",
    "the kk expansions are given by , @xmath44\\bigg ] , \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{u}_{i}(x , y)&=&\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\bigg[u_{ir}(x)+\\sqrt{2}\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\big [ \\mathcal{u}^{n}_{ir}(x)\\cos\\frac{ny}{r}+ \\mathcal{u}^{n}_{il}(x)\\sin\\frac{ny}{r}\\big]\\bigg ] , \\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{d}_{i}(x , y)&=&\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\bigg[d_{ir}(x)+\\sqrt{2}\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\big [ \\mathcal{d}^{n}_{ir}(x)\\cos\\frac{ny}{r}+ \\mathcal{d}^{n}_{il}(x)\\sin\\frac{ny}{r}\\big]\\bigg ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 are generation indices . the complex scalar field @xmath46 and the gauge boson @xmath47 are @xmath42-even fields , and their zero modes are identified with the sm scalar and gauge boson respectively .",
    "the field @xmath48 is a real scalar transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , and it does not have any zero mode .",
    "the fields @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 describe the 5d quark doublet and singlet states , respectively , whose zero modes correspond to the chiral sm quark states .",
    "the mode expansions of the doublet and singlet leptons can be written _",
    "mutatis mutandis_.      at a given @xmath1 , the kk mass is given by @xmath52 .",
    "so , _ modulo _ the zero mode masses , the kk states are degenerate . but",
    "this is only a tree level result .",
    "radiative corrections lift this degeneracy @xcite . to provide intuition ,",
    "let us consider the kinetic term of a scalar field as @xcite @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are renormalization constants .",
    "recall that tree level kk masses originate from the kinetic term in the @xmath26-direction .",
    "if @xmath56 , there is no correction to those masses . but",
    "this equality follows from lorentz invariance .",
    "when a direction is compactified , lorentz invariance breaks down .",
    "then @xmath57 , leading to @xmath58",
    ". more specifically , there are two kinds of radiative corrections .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is seen that the signal and background are both small .",
    "the minimum integrated luminosity required for a 5@xmath7 discovery as a function of @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lumilim ] ( brown dotted curve ) . with a data set of 100 @xmath40 the reach of the four - lepton channel",
    "is 600 ( 500 ) gev for the lhc running with @xmath59 14 ( 10 ) tev .",
    "universal extra - dimensional models provide a rich spectrum of towers of kk excitation modes of the sm particles .",
    "these kk modes are characterised by the integers @xmath1 = 1,2,3  they bear the same quantum numbers as their zero - mode counterparts but carry higher masses with constant spacing , given by @xmath60 ( upto zero mode masses ) .",
    "bearing in mind all the different experimental constraints on @xmath41 , the lowest ( i.e. , @xmath1 = 1 ) kk excitations can still be very much within the reach of the lhc . due to the conservation of kk number at the tree level vertices which follows from the symmetry of the lagrangian , such kk modes are likely to be produced in pairs .",
    "quantum corrections cause splitting among the different kk states at the same level .",
    "the lightest of the @xmath1 = 1 states  the @xmath31  is stable and escapes undetected . in this paper , from the point of view of signal to background optimization ( see introduction ) , we have focussed on the production of the @xmath1 = 1 excitation of a gauge boson along with an @xmath1 = 1 excited quark .",
    "the decay of the gauge boson excitations gives rise to leptons and missing @xmath3 ( from the undetected @xmath31 ) while the quark excitation produces a jet , missing @xmath3 and possibly leptons .",
    "thus , the signal is a jet , several leptons and missing @xmath3 .",
    "the sm background for these final state topologies is larger than the signal , sometimes overwhelmingly .",
    "we have shown that with judiciously chosen kinematic cuts , including an isolation of the jet from all leptons , the signal can be enhanced _",
    "vis -  - vis _ the background , while retaining enough signal events for a positive verdict with 100 @xmath40 of data .",
    "this will be possible so long as @xmath8 does not exceed about 700@xmath39800 gev considering that the lhc would have an accumulated luminosity of ( 100@xmath39300 ) @xmath40 at @xmath6 = 14 tev .",
    "we have classified the cuts in two categories .",
    "first , we imposed some basic cuts to suit lhc observability : ( @xmath61 ) the leptons are required to satisfy @xmath62 5 gev , ( @xmath63 ) the jet must have a @xmath3 not less than 20 gev , and ( @xmath64 ) the missing transverse momentum must be more than 25 gev . beyond this , other kinematic cuts have been appropriately imposed on a case - by - case basis depending on the number of leptons in the final state . out of these",
    ", two cuts deserve special mention : ( @xmath61 ) the requirement of an isolation of the jet from all leptons is found to be quite useful to remove the top and bottom quark related backgrounds , and ( @xmath63 ) a cut on the lepton - pair invariant mass to remove on - shell sm @xmath54 production backgrounds is also quite effective .",
    "our main observation for the specific ued signal cross sections at the lhc with @xmath6 = 14 tev after the imposition of the kinematic cuts is as follows :    * single jet @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath65 two leptons :   signal : 12.52 @xmath67 ,   background : 9.18 @xmath67 , * single jet @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath65 three leptons :   signal : 5.00 @xmath67 ,   background : 1.02 @xmath67 , * single jet @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath65 four leptons :   signal : 0.573 @xmath67 ,   background : 0.004 @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis performed here is based on a parton - level simulation and is of an exploratory nature .",
    "for example , it has been assumed that the detectors are of perfect efficiency , qcd corrections have not been included , and parton distribution function uncertainties ignored .",
    "our results encourage a detailed careful analysis with full detector simulation .",
    "it should be observed that the spectrum and the couplings in ued or such extra - dimensional models are reminiscent of many different non - supersymmetric scenarios which contain additional gauge bosons and/or vector - like fermions",
    ". a crucial component of ued is the presence of a stable @xmath31 which makes it different from its peers .",
    "the following observation is worth noticing .",
    "conceptually , ued is closer to the randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario than supersymmetry , so one would navely expect similar observational features between ued and rs than , say , between ued and supersymmetry .",
    "first recall the similarities between ued and rs .",
    "although , the extra space is warped for rs and flat for ued , both yield kk modes as a consequence of compactification of an extra space dimension , and in both cases , the sm particles and their kk partners share the same spin .",
    "this is in contrast to the supersymmetric extension of the sm ( which may be interpreted as a theory with an extra dimension in fermion coordinates ) , where the sm particles and their superpartners carry different spin .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out that from an observational point of view , ued is closer to supersymmetry with conserved @xmath41-parity ( or , for that matter , little higgs models with conserved @xmath68-parity ) than rs .",
    "this happens primarily because the simplest version of rs lacks a stable @xmath31 due to the absence of kk parity , while supersymmetry with conserved @xmath41-parity ( or , little higgs with conserved @xmath68-parity ) does contain a stable superparticle ( heavy particle ) .",
    "quite a few lhc simulations of the rs scenario have been carried out @xcite .",
    "but due to the absence of any kk parity in the simplest versions of rs , the kk states , once produced , decay into the sm particles , and hence the search strategies for rs and ued would be entirely different .",
    "however , as already mentioned in the introduction , weak - scale supersymmetry , with a relatively compressed spectrum , can mimic ued and _ vice - versa _ at lhc .",
    "distinction between these two new physics alternatives can only be done by exploiting the spin information imprinted in angular distributions . a detailed study of how to differentiate ued from supersymmetry , following our line of analysis in the context of the lhc , is beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "<S> besides supersymmetry , the other prime candidate of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , crying out for verification at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , is extra - dimension . to hunt for effects of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of known fermions and bosons is very much in the agenda of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> these kk states arise when the sm particles penetrate in the extra space - like dimension(s ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a 5d scenario , called ` universal extra dimension ' , where the extra space coordinate , compactified on an orbifold @xmath0 , is accessed by _ all _ the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the kk number ( @xmath1 ) is conserved at all tree level vertices . </S>",
    "<S> this entails the production of kk states in pairs and renders the lightest kk particle stable , which leaves the detector carrying away missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting between different kk flavors is controlled by the zero mode masses and the bulk- and brane - induced one - loop radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the production of an @xmath2 kk electroweak gauge boson in association with an @xmath2 kk quark . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a signal consisting of _ only one _ jet , one or more leptons and missing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> for definiteness we usually choose the inverse radius of compactification to be @xmath4 gev , which sets the scale of the lowest lying kk states . </S>",
    "<S> we show on a case - by - case basis ( depending on the number of leptons in the final state ) that with 10 @xmath5 integrated luminosity at the lhc with @xmath6 = 14 tev this signal can be detected over the sm background by imposing appropriate kinematic cuts . </S>",
    "<S> we record some of the expectations for a possible intermediate lhc run at @xmath6 = 10 tev and also exhibit the integrated luminosity required to obtain a 5@xmath7 signal as a function of @xmath8 .    ` </S>",
