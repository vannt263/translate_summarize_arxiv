    "currently the www is undergoing a landmark revolution from the traditional web 1.0 to web 2.0 characterized by social collaborative technologies , such as social networking site , blog , wiki and folksonomy .",
    "the social web ( or more specifically , online social systems ) , a label that includes both social networking sites ( such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and social media sites ( such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , is changing the way content is created and distributed .",
    "web - based authoring tools enable users to rapidly publish content , from stories and opinion pieces on weblogs , to photographs and videos on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , to advice on @xmath6 , and to web discoveries on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the availability of large - scale electronic databases has delivered us extraordinary new insights on the human behaviors and human dynamics on the web .",
    "the clear patterns and regularities in individual distributions in respect of popularity and activity in some online social systems have been revealed [ 1 - 8 ] .",
    "evidently web users vary widely in their activity levels .",
    "take @xmath2 as example , some users casually browse the front page , voting on one or two stories .",
    "others spend hours a day combing the web for new stories to submit , and voting on stories they found on @xmath2 .",
    "also different items on the web vary widely in their popularity .",
    "some stories can attract large attention and their influence can last for a long time while most stories only can attract very little attention and their impact vanishes rapidly . in social media sites a @xmath9-@xmath10 is usually used to visualize the popularity of items , or more specifically , tags .",
    "typical tag - clouds have between 30 and 150 tags .",
    "the popularity is represented using font sizes , colors or other visual clues .",
    "1 shows a tag - cloud with terms related to web 2.0 .",
    "recently much attention has been devoted to investigating the statistical feature of individual popularity and activity in online social systems .",
    "their distributions show the wide - spread believed power law or general heavy - tailed ones intermediate between exponential and power law , such as stretched exponential or log - normal [ 2 , 5 , 9 ] . despite the great progress made",
    ", little work is done on the underlying mechanism governing the statistical feature of popularity and activity in online social systems , which will be explored in the work .",
    "we can start our analysis from a time - ordered table of item assignments .",
    "for the system as a whole , we can define an intrinsic time @xmath11 as the index of an item assignment into such a table , so that @xmath11 runs from 1 to the number of total item assignments . the temporal process shown in fig .",
    "2 can be regarded as the process of appearance of entity @xmath12 or @xmath13 . and",
    "the frequency of occurrence for some user / item in the total @xmath11 events can be defined as its activity / popularity .",
    "thus activity measures how frequently a user performs a specific action , such as listening to music , seeing films , browsing posts and sending friendship invitations to other users on the web , and popularity measures how frequently an item ( such as music , films , posts and tags ) is visited by web users .",
    "note that for items we can only measure their popularity , while for users , in some cases , we can measure not only their activity but also popularity .",
    "for instance in online social networks , users can invite other users to be their friends .",
    "thus we can measure the activity of users in terms of the number of sent invitations , and can also measure the popularity of users in terms of the number of received invitations .",
    "it is natural that the number of distinct items or users @xmath14 increases with @xmath11 , however different growth patterns can appear .",
    "generally @xmath15 , where @xmath16 implies sub - linear growth while @xmath17 linear growth , i.e. the generation probability of new individuals is a constant value ( homogeneous poisson process ) . besides the more frequently an individual appears , the more possibly the individual will appear once again .",
    "specifically , when an old individual joins the sequence , the probability that it will be a specific old individual @xmath18 with previous frequency of appearance @xmath19 is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 )",
    ". the preference metric @xmath22 implies sub - linear preference while @xmath23 linear preference .",
    "the case where @xmath24 and @xmath23 corresponds to the classic simon model [ 10 , 11 ] .    when an old individual joins the sequence , the probability that individual @xmath18 with frequency @xmath19 is selected can be expressed as @xmath25 .",
    "thus we can compute the probability @xmath26 that an old individual of frequency @xmath27 is chosen , and it is normalized by the number of individuals of frequency @xmath27 that exist just before this step [ 12 , 13 ] : @xmath28 } } /\\sum\\nolimits_t { |\\{u}:k_u ( t - 1 ) = k\\ } | \\sim k^\\beta$ ] , where @xmath29 represents that at time @xmath30 the old individual whose frequency is @xmath27 at time @xmath31 is chosen .",
    "we use @xmath32 $ ] to denote a predicate ( take value of 1 if expression is true , else 0 ) .",
    "generally @xmath26 has significant fluctuations , particularly for large @xmath27 . to reduce the noise level , instead of",
    "@xmath26 we can study the cumulative function to obtain the preference metric @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "consider that users are listening to music . at a discrete time step @xmath11",
    ", a new user may appear with probability @xmath35 , whereas with probability @xmath36 an existing old user can appear .",
    "we can apply the mean field method to analytically obtain the probability distribution for individual popularity and activity .",
    "when @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 according to @xmath39 and @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 the initial condition is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the time when the individual @xmath18 appeared for the first time .",

    "( 8) to an exponential distribution .",
    "generally the stretched exponential distribution is correlative with sub - linear preference while power law distribution linear preference [ 14 , 15 ] .",
    "we ground our empirical analysis on actual log data extracted from an online media site @xmath60 [ 5 ] and an online social network @xmath61 [ 6 ] . note that our approach of investigation is also applicable to other online social systems .",
    "@xmath60 is located in a large chinese university with more than 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students , and only is accessible to the ip addresses within the university .",
    "we recorded its visiting log from october 25th , 2006 to february 6th , 2007 in the data format : time @xmath43/user i d number @xmath12/music i d number @xmath13 , i.e. a user @xmath12 listened to a song @xmath13 at time @xmath43 .",
    "users were distinguished by their ip addresses .",
    "the total number of log we obtained is 2,136,149 , the number of different music recorded is 98,747 ( mostly popular songs ) , and the number of users recorded is 8472 .",

    "each registered user has a profile , including his / her list of friends . for privacy reasons ,",
    "the data , logged from may 11th , 2005 ( the inception day for the internet community ) to august 22nd , 2007 , include only each user s i d and list of friends , and the time of sending and accepting friendship invitations .",

    "there are 273,395 sent invitations and more than 99.9% have been accepted .",
    "the total number of users recorded is @xmath66 . like most social networking sites , in @xmath61 ,",
    "only when the sent friendship invitations are accepted , can the inviters and receivers become online friends .",
    "we can measure users activity and popularity in terms of their numbers of sent and received invitations .    in @xmath60 individual activity and popularity",
    "can be well described by stretched exponential distribution , which is shown in fig .",
    "3 . while in fig .",
    "4 , the distribution of users activity and popularity in @xmath61 has a power law tail .    .",
    "a stretched exponential distribution will show a straight line if we use @xmath67 as @xmath68-axis and @xmath69 as @xmath70-axis .",
    "the solid lines represent the fitted lines.,width=528 ]    .",

    "5 shows the @xmath71 versus @xmath27 for music and users in @xmath60 .",
    "for these two cases , the sub - linear preferential selection hypothesis can offer a good approximation .",
    "the values of @xmath33 for users and music are approximately 0.61 and 0.79 , respectively . for the ccdf of users activity",
    ", our model gives @xmath72 and the empirical distribution in fig .",
    "3 gives @xmath73 , while for music s popularity , our model gives @xmath74 and the empirical distribution gives @xmath75 .",
    "6 shows the @xmath71 versus @xmath27 for users in @xmath61 .",
    "approximately @xmath76 for users activity and popularity , indicating linear preference .",
    "the appearance probabilities @xmath77 of new users in the time - ordered lists of users of sending and receiving invitations are 0.53 and 0.35 , respectively . for the ccdf of users activity ,",
    "the model gives @xmath78 , while for users popularity the model gives @xmath79 .",
    "the power law exponents achieve proper agreement with the empirical results in fig .",
    "4 .     versus @xmath27 for music ( a ) and users ( b ) in @xmath60.,width=528 ]        fig . 7 shows the growth of the numbers of different users / music @xmath14 in @xmath60 and users @xmath14 in @xmath61 with @xmath11 .",
    "the traditional assumption , as applied in the previous deduction , is that the generation probability of new individuals is a constant value , i.e. @xmath80 .",
    "however as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the hypothesis is unrealistic to some extent . for",
    "the @xmath61 users , approximatively the slopes for senders and receivers are 1.09 and 0.97 , respectively , however for the users / music in @xmath60 , the growth lines show several segments with different slopes . in some cases",
    "the number of distinct items @xmath14 introduced by users after @xmath11 assignments can grow approximately as @xmath15 with @xmath81 . when dealing with the evolution of the number of attributes pertaining to some collection of objects , this sub - linear growth is generally referred to as heaps law [ 16 ] .",
    "as an example , sub - linear behavior has been observed in the growth of vocabulary size in texts , i.e. in the number of different words in a text as a function of the total number of words observed while scanning through it . for the case of english corpora , vocabulary growth exponents in the range @xmath82",
    "have been reported [ 17 ] .     in @xmath60 and",
    "users @xmath14 in @xmath61 with @xmath11 . for comparison the approximately linear growth @xmath83(@xmath84 for large @xmath11 ) and",
    "sub - linear growth @xmath85 are also shown .",
    "note that growth curves are only feasible under @xmath86.,width=384 ]    the rate at which new items appear at time @xmath11 scales as @xmath87 .",
    "that is , new items appear less and less frequently , with the invention rate of new items monotonically decreasing towards zero .",
    "the approach to zero is however so slow that the cumulated number of items , asymptotically , does not converge to a constant value but is unbounded - assuming the observed trend stays valid .",
    "different users or items with distinct activity or popularity may have quite different @xmath88 .",
    "recent research on the collaborative tagging system @xmath89 reveals that for less and less popular resources being bookmarked , the distribution of growth exponent @xmath90 of distinct tags gets broader and its peak shifts towards higher values of @xmath88 , indicating that the growth behavior is becoming more and more linear [ 3 ] .",
    "table 1 summarizes the probability distributions of popularity and activity for different patterns of growth and preferential selection which can appear in real life . for sub - linear growth and linear preference ,",
    "the recent research shows that when the rate at which new items appear @xmath91 , the distribution can be approximately viewed as a power law @xmath92 [ 18 ] .",
    "for sub - linear growth and sub - linear preference , unfortunately the analysis for probability distribution can lead to a rather intractable relation whose analytical solution is hard to obtain .",
    "qualitatively in this case the distribution is still a fat - tailed one intermediate between exponential and power law .",
    "for some sub - linear growth exponent , the distribution resulted from sub - linear preference will be more homogeneous than that ( power law ) resulted from linear preference ; while for some sub - linear preference exponent , the distribution resulted from sub - linear growth will be more heterogeneous than that ( stretched exponential distribution ) resulted from linear growth .",
    ".probability distributions of popularity and activity for different patterns of growth and preference .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the distributions of individual popularity and activity in many online social systems can follow generic heavy - tailed ones , unnecessarily power law [ 19 - 24 ] . several aspects of the underlying intricate dynamics may be responsible for the feature . except sub - linear preference discussed above ,",
    "another possible origin is the memory effect , that is , newly appeared individuals will appear more frequently than old ones .",
    "for example web users tend to listen to recently added music or apply recently added tags more frequently than old ones , which may be equivalent to the ageing effect of individuals .",
    "the popularity or activity of an entity will inevitably undergo a decaying process .",
    "users become less active and items become less attractive over the time [ 25 - 29 ] .    according to growth and preference characteristic ,",
    "it is possible to predict the amount that would be devoted over time to given ones by measuring the data at an early time .",
    "however the method does not consider the semantics of popularity and why some items become more popular than others [ 30 ] .",
    "that is , popularity prediction in the presence of a large table of item assignments can essentially be made based on the observed early time series , while semantic analysis of content may be more useful when no early click - through information is known .",
    "semantic attraction can lead to the initial prevalence of items and subsequent preferential selection strengthens the popularity .",
