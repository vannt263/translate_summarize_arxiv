    "addressing the flavor puzzle , that is to say pinning down the origin of the standard model ( sm ) fermion mass hierarchies and mixing patterns , has led to the formulation of different and ample number of theoretical ideas .",
    "although seemingly unrelated , most of these approaches follow two conceptually distinct theoretical trends : @xmath4 the underlying flavor theory involves new flavor symmetries under which different generation sm fermions ( quarks and charged leptons ) carry different charges . mass hierarchies and mixing patterns",
    "are thus understood as a consequence of the different transformation properties of quarks and charged leptons , which in the sm yukawa sector ",
    "being an effective realization of the fundamental flavor theory  are not manifest .",
    "certainly , the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite provides the most representative example for this kind of approaches .",
    "@xmath5 the other avenue consists in promoting the maximal global flavor symmetry of the sm gauge invariant kinetic lagrangian ( @xmath6 , in shorthand notation ) @xcite to a fundamental flavor symmetry , something that calls for a @xmath7-invariant ultra - violet ( uv ) completion , endowed with scalar ( flavon ) fields capable of triggering spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of @xmath7 ( or its subgroups ) @xcite . in this picture , therefore , mass ( yukawa ) hierarchies and mixing patterns result from a high - scale dynamics rather than by a mismatch in sm fermion fields new quantum numbers .",
    "arguably , if a theory of flavor is indeed at work at a certain high - energy scale ( @xmath8 ) , it should provide as well the framework for other phenomenological puzzles to be addressed .",
    "in particular , one could envisage a more profound picture from where neutrino masses , the baryon asymmetry of the universe and dark matter emerge .",
    "thus , from this perspective , in principle unrelated phenomena would be just manifestations of a comprehensive scenario in which the flavor symmetry plays  directly or indirectly  an essential rle in e.g. neutrino mass generation or dark matter stabilization .    in this letter",
    "we show that several aspects of such endeavor can be pursued without specifying the complete uv theory . adopting approach @xmath5 , we consider the generation of residual discrete abelian symmetries @xmath0 whose origin can be traced back to the flavor symmetry of the gauge invariant kinetic lagrangian .",
    "we rely on the abelian part of the complete flavor symmetry , following well - established methods to induce residual symmetries from @xmath1-invariant theories @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of the approach is shown with two example models , both with an extended lepton sector and a second higgs doublet : ( i ) a minimal scenario where the breaking of the flavor symmetry leads to the _ scotogenic _ model lagrangian @xcite , and ( ii ) a different scenario leading to a remnant @xmath2 symmetry , which not only stabilizes dark matter , but also guarantees neutrino mass generation at the 2-loop level .",
    "these worked - examples are of course not unique , e.g. several other higher order remnant symmetries can be generated , including even direct products @xmath9 .",
    "ssb of @xmath1 symmetries and their connection with discrete @xmath0 symmetries are not at all new subjects @xcite .",
    "we find however a pivotal conceptual difference between these approaches and what we here aim at discussing : the @xmath1 factors are `` sourced '' by the same symmetry that dictates fermion mass hierarchies and mixing patterns .",
    "thus , in scenarios where the remnant discrete @xmath0 symmetry plays a rle in e.g. dark matter stabilization and/or neutrino mass generation , this approach can be  conceivably  understood as a first step towards the establishment of a common comprehensive framework for flavor , neutrino and dark matter physics .",
    "as has been previously anticipated , the group of global symmetry transformations of the gauge invariant kinetic terms of the sm quark doublet ( @xmath10 ) and singlets ( @xmath11 ) , lepton doublet ( @xmath12 ) and singlet ( @xmath13 ) , and higgs doublet ( @xmath14 ) is given by @xcite @xmath15\\times u(1)_{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "the sm yukawa interactions , however , explicitly break this symmetry leaving behind just five global @xmath1 factors : @xmath17    \\times u(1)_y\\ , \\ ] ] readily identifiable with conservation of baryon ( @xmath18 ) and lepton flavor ( @xmath19 ) numbers ( sm accidental symmetries ) and hypercharge ( @xmath20 ) , which according to tab .",
    "[ tab : table-1 ] are given by the following linear combinations of the @xmath21 charges : @xmath22    it is worth stressing at this point that , since massive neutrinos is an experimental fact , @xmath23 is actually broken .",
    "if neutrinos have dirac masses , one can have total lepton number @xmath24 conservation . on the other hand , if neutrinos have majorana masses , even @xmath24 is broken .",
    "formal invariance of the full lagrangian under @xmath7 can however be recovered , provided the yukawa couplings are promoted to complex scalar fields , i.e. flavon fields with definitive @xmath7 transformations ( see tab . [",
    "tab : table-1 ] ) but singlets under the sm gauge symmetry . at the `` fundamental '' level , this means that at some unknown  but certainly large  energy scale , @xmath7 is an exact symmetry of the uv lagrangian .",
    "the flavor symmetry is then spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of new heavy scalar degrees of freedom with suitable @xmath7 transformation properties .",
    "thus , in that picture the sm yukawa lagrangian ( which emerges once below the characteristic uv energy scale @xmath8 the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out ) is an effective manifestation of the flavored uv theory , namely @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the second pauli matrix .",
    "the lagrangian , written in this way , assumes that @xmath29 triggers not only ssb of the non - abelian sector of @xmath7 but also of the abelian sector , the @xmath1 factors .",
    "this choice is to some extent arbitrary , and indeed more interesting possibilities do exist , see for example @xcite .",
    ".flavor transformation properties of the sm fermion and higgs fields as well as of the scalar fields @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the charges of the different @xmath1 factors . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the picture described so far is however incomplete since neutrino masses must be generated .",
    "here we will assume that neutrinos are majorana fermions , thus breaking lepton number .",
    "although one could well extend the sm lagrangian to include the dimension five lepton number breaking operator @xmath33 @xcite , we stick to the _ standard _ picture involving _ three _ right - handed neutrinos @xmath34 .",
    "this implies enlarging @xmath7 to @xmath35 @xcite , and introducing additional flavon fields to give rise to the observed mass spectrum and mixing in the lepton sector through ssb .",
    "furthermore , it requires extending the definition of lepton number in eq . to @xmath36 . in this context",
    ", @xmath37 breaking has been shown to have deep implications , allowing the detachment of the right - handed neutrino mass and lepton number - breaking scales @xcite , or rendering right - handed neutrino production viable , and in some cases implying large charged lepton flavor - violating effects @xcite .",
    "certainly the dynamics of the non - abelian sector of @xmath7 plays a rle .",
    "actually , in full generality , one should expect the uv completion to involve not only ssb of the non - abelian structure via `` yukawa '' fields , but also of the abelian one through flavon fields .",
    "thus , the question is then whether that dynamics leaves traces beyond those that we have discussed .",
    "this might be indeed the case , provided the flavored uv completion involves scalar fields with suitable charges under some of the @xmath1 global factors ( a single one suffices ) .",
    "let us discuss this in more detail .",
    "consider a simple model of two self - interacting scalar fields ( @xmath38 ) subject to the following global @xmath1 transformations @xcite : @xmath39 the @xmath1-invariant renormalizable as well as non - renormalizable lagrangian describing such system is given by : @xmath40 with @xmath41 dimension one and @xmath42 dimensionless couplings .",
    "if @xmath43 acquires a vev the resulting lagrangian will involve a collection of terms @xmath44 , thus being @xmath0 invariant , namely @xmath45    although discussed in a rather simple context , this idea can be extended to realistic models involving fermion fields and therefore yukawa terms .",
    "there is however something that one should bear in mind .",
    "ssb of the global flavor symmetry , including its @xmath1 factors , imply the presence of massless nambu - goldstone bosons for which a large variety of phenomenological constraints exist , including rare decays , cosmological and astrophysical data .",
    "one solution is that of gauging part of or the full flavor symmetry , which of course implies the presence of new gauge bosons and calls for gauge anomaly cancellation which requires the introduction of new fermions @xcite . if one insists on a global symmetry , phenomenological consistency can be achieved provided",
    "ssb takes place at a rather high energy scale , which will suppress couplings to fermions @xcite",
    ". however , scalar couplings with the higgs sector at the renormalizable level can potentially affect the higgs phenomenology ( e.g. giving rise to higgs invisible decays ) .",
    "guided by the aforementioned considerations , we now turn to the discussion of some specific @xmath0-based realizations .",
    "since we consider only the ( extended ) lepton sector , we assume that all beyond the sm ( bsm ) fields transform trivially under the quark flavor symmetry , @xmath46 , and we only specify their transformation properties under @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , we focus on fields which give rise to light neutrino masses .",
    "for instance , the sm lepton and higgs doublet are written respectively as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for definiteness , we consider models extended with a second higgs doublet @xmath50 and three right - handed neutrinos @xmath51 while the flavon fields which we will introduce below are singlets under the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "it is worth stressing that the approach discussed here is not limited to scenarios with right - handed neutrinos . in principle",
    ", it can be implemented in a large variety of bsm scenarios , where the inclusion of additional degrees of freedom leads to an enlargement of the flavor symmetry and thus to additional @xmath1 factors whose ssb result in remnant discrete symmetries .",
    "this includes models with larger symmetry groups and models with a non - trivial embedding of the quark sector . +",
    "* model i : * with a setup defined as above , one can envisage different flavor - invariant lagrangians depending on the number of available gauge singlet flavon fields . assuming a minimal content , subject to flavor transformation properties given by @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the following lepton sector yukawa lagrangian",
    "can be written : @xmath55 here , one can also choose @xmath56 to be an @xmath57 triplet",
    ". such a choice will certainly affect the majorana mass spectrum , but will not have any impact in our conclusions .",
    "note that one can not write charged lepton yukawa couplings involving @xmath58 , nor type - i seesaw yukawa couplings involving @xmath14 .",
    "their presence would require extra `` yukawa '' fields , which are absent as demanded by our minimality criteria .",
    "the flavor - invariant and renormalizable scalar potential consist of three pieces : @xmath59 where @xmath60 has an obvious meaning and @xmath61 involves quadratic and quartic @xmath56 terms as well as mixed @xmath62 and @xmath63 terms . of particular interest for neutrino mass generation is the @xmath64 piece , which we explicitly write : @xmath65 as long as @xmath61 allows for a @xmath66 non - invariant ground state , the @xmath66 symmetry will be spontaneously broken to @xmath67 via @xmath68 .",
    "one could also have an additional remnant symmetry e.g. if @xmath69 , one will be left with a residual @xmath70 . ]",
    "the @xmath67 abelian discrete symmetry is , therefore , a residual symmetry resulting from the ssb of the global @xmath37 factor . at this symmetry breaking stage",
    ", @xmath67 is an exact symmetry of the full lagrangian under which the sm fields are even while the bsm fields @xmath34 and @xmath58 are odd .",
    "it will remain so  even after electroweak symmetry breaking  provided @xmath71 and @xmath72 in ( [ scalar - potential - h - phi-1 ] ) are positive , case in which @xmath73 .",
    "-based model . ]    under these conditions , the setup of eqs .",
    "( [ lagrangian - mfv - nu - scot ] ) , ( [ eq : full - scalar - potential - z2-case ] ) and ( [ scalar - potential - h - phi-1 ] ) is @xmath24 invariant ( even though right - handed neutrino majorana mass terms are generated after ssb of @xmath74 ) . since light majorana",
    "neutrino masses demand lepton number violation , new terms are then required .",
    "the simplest choice is to include a new flavon @xmath75 which enables extending the scalar potential in ( [ eq : full - scalar - potential - z2-case ] ) with a non - renormalizable term : @xmath76 after @xmath77 acquires a vev , this term will induce an effective coupling @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the presence of this new term implies unavoidably @xmath24 breaking ( by two units ) .",
    "the setup therefore generates light majorana neutrino masses at the 1-loop level via the exchange of right - handed neutrinos and the neutral cp - even and cp - odd components of @xmath58 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop - diagram ] and exactly as in the scotogenic model @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath82 being an effective coupling , it is expected to be small ( @xmath83 ) , which in turn implies a small mass splitting between @xmath80 and @xmath81 . + * model ii : * we now go a step further and consider the case of a remnant higher order cyclic symmetry , where not only the would - be yukawa couplings are effective terms , but also the @xmath84 coupling .",
    "this requires the introduction of three flavon fields , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , we also include three generations of the new fermionic field @xmath88 , the left - handed dirac partner of @xmath34 , with exactly the same transformation properties under all gauge and flavor symmetries  , @xmath34 would be a massless dark matter particle , something ruled out by cosmological data .",
    "moreover , this is actually required for gauge anomaly cancellation if we promote e.g. @xmath89 to a local symmetry . ] . under these considerations , the yukawa sector consists of the first two non - renormalizable terms in  ( [ lagrangian - mfv - nu - scot ] ) and the terms @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "flavor invariance allows , of course , for scalar terms which are readily derivable , and so we do not write them explicitly",
    ". we just highlight the existence of two terms of particular relevance for neutrino mass generation : @xmath92 we will assume that the complete scalar potential has a minimum characterized by @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath96 gets spontaneously broken , leaving a remnant @xmath2 symmetry under which @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and the remaining fields transform trivially .",
    "as in the previous example , this symmetry is generated from @xmath37 ssb .    -based model . ]    in the present setup @xmath24 is violated , inducing majorana neutrino masses at the 2-loop order , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop - diagram ] . in the same vein of the @xmath67 case , the remnant @xmath2 symmetry allows for dark matter stabilization , which can be either of fermionic or scalar nature , namely @xmath100 , @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "however , in contrast to the usual @xmath67-based dark matter scenarios , this dark matter particle will have semi - annihilation processes  @xcite .",
    "we have pointed out that the same dynamical flavor symmetry that governs sm fermions mass hierarchies and mixing patterns , might be as well at the origin of abelian discrete symmetries , @xmath0 .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking of the abelian sector yields such symmetries , provided the flavored uv completion involves flavon fields with suitable charges .",
    "these symmetries , which quite often are _ ad hoc _ `` artifacts '' , are employed for majorana neutrino mass generation and dark matter stabilization , among others .",
    "thus , we have suggested that the discrete symmetry generated in this way , provides a non - trivial link between the _ theory _ of flavor and the origin of neutrino masses and dark matter .",
    "we have shown the feasibility of this approach by constructing @xmath67- and @xmath2-based models , the former resembling the well - known scotogenic model , while the latter a new realization with quite a few interesting phenomenological implications .    in summary , we argued that discrete @xmath0 symmetries have a dynamical flavor origin , and we have illustrated how this approach can be implemented .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that this picture offers several interesting theoretical as well as phenomenological avenues which are worth exploring .",
