    "the mu2e experiment at fermilab  @xcite aims to search for charged lepton flavor violation ( clfv ) in the neutrino - less , coherent conversion of a negative muon into an electron in the coulomb field of an @xmath2al nucleus .",
    "the @xmath3 conversion results in a mono energetic electron with an energy equal to the muon rest mass minus the corrections for the nuclear recoil and the binding energy of the muon . for @xmath2al",
    "the energy of the mono energetic electron is equal to @xmath4 mev .",
    "the experiment is designed to reach the single event sensitivity of @xmath5 in three years @xcite .",
    "this value represents an improvement of four order of magnitude over the current best experimental limit set by sindrum ii experiment @xcite .",
    "the standard model predicted rate for this process is @xmath6  @xcite , therefore any signal observed by mu2e would be a compelling evidence of new physics .",
    "the mu2e detector is designed to be almost background free and it is located inside a large superconducting solenoid with a magnetic field of 1 t in the region of the calorimeter . this detector is located just behind the tracker and complements it by providing : powerful @xmath7 particle identification , seed for pattern recognition in the tracker and an independent software trigger system . efficient particle identification requires a time resolution better than 500 ps and an energy resolution @xmath8 .    the calorimeter should be able to operate in an environment where a dose up to 100 krad and a neutron fluency of @xmath9 n/@xmath10 are expected .",
    "it must also works in a 1 t magnetic field and @xmath11 torr vacuum ensuring the redundancy of the component .",
    "due to physical and geometrical constraints , we decided to adopt a solution with two annuli made by undoped csi crystals each read out using two silicon photomultipliers .",
    "each disk has an internal ( external ) radius of 374 mm ( 660 mm ) and is filled with @xmath12 mm@xmath13 crystals ( see fig.[figura1 ] ) .",
    "the disks are separated by about half electron wavelength ( 75 cm ) .",
    "the analog read out electronics is connected to the sipm while the digital boards are housed in the crates in the top of each disk .",
    "the discussed requirements pushed the experiment to adopt a calorimeter made by undoped csi crystals optically coupled to @xmath14 mm@xmath15 large area uv - extended sipm",

    "measured energy resolution for a @xmath16 csi matrix with hamamatsu tsv @xmath17 mm@xmath15 mppcs using electrons between 80 and 120 mev . ]",
    "the requirements of the electromagnetic calorimeter imply to use crystals with :    * high light output * good light response uniformity , lru , ( @xmath18 ) * fast signal with small component ( @xmath19 ns ) * radiation hard with maximum light output loss below 40% * small radiation induced readout noise ( below 0.6% )    in the conceptual design report  @xcite , the baseline calorimeter choice was lyso crystals readout with apd and many tests were carried out for this option  @xcite .",
    "a large increase on the lu@xmath20o@xmath21 salt price in 2013 made this option unaffordable , so that for the tdr  @xcite we have opted for cheaper crystals such as baf2 and csi .",
    "after a long r&d program  @xcite , we have finally selected undoped csi crystals as baseline choice ( see tab.[tabella1 ] ) .    @l*15l crystal & @xmath22 & lyso & csi & @xmath23 + density [ @xmath24 & 4.89 & 7.28 & 4.51 & 8.28 + radiation length [ cm ] & 2.03 & 1.14 & 1.86 & 0.9 + moliere radius [ cm ] & 3.10 & 2.07 & 3.57 & 2.0 + de / dx [ mev / cm ] & 6.5 & 10.0 & 5.56 & 13.0 + refractive index at @xmath25 & 1.50 & 1.82 & 1.95 & 2.20 + peak luminescence [ nm ] & 220/300 & 402 & 310 & 420 + decay time [ ns ] & 0.9/650 & 40 & 26 & 30/10 + light yield [ % nai ] & 4.1/3.6 & 85 & 3.6 & 0.3/0.1 + light yield variation with temperature [ % /@xmath26 & 0.1/-1.9 & -0.2 & -1.4 & -2.5 + hygroscopicity & none & none & slight & none +    tests on csi crystals",
    "have been performed for three different vendors : isma ( ukraine ) , siccas ( china ) and optomaterial ( italy ) .",
    "these crystals have been irradiated up to 900 gy and to a neutron fluency up to @xmath27 n@xmath28/@xmath10 .",
    "the ionization dose does not modify lru while a 20% reduction in light yield has been observed at 900 gy .",
    "similarly , the neutron flux causes a 15% light yield deterioration .",
    "these results are compatible with the requirements of the calorimeter .",
    "a small unroped csi matrix has been built and tested in frascati beam test facility using electrons with energy between 80 and 120 mev .",
    "the prototype is a @xmath16 matrix and each crystal is read out using an array of sixteen @xmath16 mm@xmath15 hamamatsu tsv mppcs . during this test",
    "we measured a light yield of 30 ( 20 ) pe / mev with ( without ) optical grease with tyvek wrapping . the measured time and energy resolution , 110 ps and 7% respectively ,",
    "perfectly match our initial requirements ( ref .",
    "fig.[figura2 ] ) .",
    "the requirement of having a small air gap between crystal and photodetector and the request of redundancy in the read out implies the use of custom sipms . for the mu2e experiment",
    "we have increased the transversal dimension of the csi from @xmath29 to @xmath30 mm@xmath15 in order to accomodate two @xmath31-arrays of @xmath32 mm@xmath15 uv - extended sipm .",
    "this allows to work with an air - gap while satisfying the pe / mev requirement with a single sipm .",
    "presently , we are testing both hamamatsu mppcs and fbk uv - extended silicon photomultipliers .",
    "the photosensors are packaged using a parallel arrangement of two groups of three cells biased in series .",
    "the samples already acquired show a good pde ( @xmath33 at 315 nm ) with a gain greater than @xmath34 at an over - voltage of 3 v with respect to the breakdown voltage .",
    "the series connection produce a signal with a total width of 70 ns .",
    "a first array has been assembled with 6 hamamatsu 6x6 mppcs and has been optically connected to a csi tyvek wrapped crystal measuring a time resolution for 1 mip ( @xmath35 mev ) of 170 ps .",
    "following calorimeter requirements , one important aspect to be considered for the read out of the crystals is the radiation hardness of the sipm . in this context",
    ", we have performed different tests using hamamatsu and fbk uv - extended devices .",
    "sipm irradiated with a dose of up to 20 krad photons source do not show any effect on the leakage current .",
    "different effects are observed with neutrons . when exposing sensors to 14 mev neutrons with a total flux of @xmath36 n/@xmath10 ( corresponding to 2.2 times the experiment lifetime ) , we observe a too high increase of the leakage current ( up to 2.3 ma when using @xmath16 mm@xmath15 hamamatsu cells ) .",
    "to reduce the leakage current to acceptable value , we need to cool down all sipm to a temperature of 0 degrees . in order to do so",
    ", we will use a dedicated cooling station for the calorimeter .",
    "the final choice of the coolant and the parameters of the station is currently under study .",

    "rendering of the fee board connected with sipm . ]",
    "each sipm is directly connected to a dedicated board ( see fig.[figura4 ] ) housing a transimpedence preamplifier with a settable gain @xmath37 or @xmath38 , 2  v dynamic range and 15 ns rise time .",
    "this board provides also a pulse signal for testing the preamplifier and a slow control readout of temperature and leakage current .",
    "the digital boards are housed into 11 crates per disk with 20 differential channels per board .",
    "these boards host a mezzanine which : receives signals from sipm , manage hv setting and includes a waveform digitizer section that is based on smartfusion ii fpga with 200 msps 12 bit adc .",
