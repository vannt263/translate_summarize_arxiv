    "the introduction of foreign particles in an amorphous matrix has for long been used for the strength reinforcement of disordered materials  @xcite . the most classical strategy consists in adding rigid particles or fibers in order to enhance the elastic properties of the composite material .",
    "an additional or alternative strategy consists in the modification of the plastic properties . here , the effect on the overall strength is more delicate .",
    "the introduction of hard particles in a very ductile matrix tends to increase the effective yield stress , hence the strength .",
    "a good illustration of this approach can be found in the development of materials for road pavements  @xcite : mineral micrometer scale fillers are introduced in a viscous bitumen to make it viscoplastic ; the obtained mastic asphalt is then reinforced through the addition of millimetric to centimetric aggregates .",
    "more recently the introduction of a ductile phase has been used to reinforce metallic glasses  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the ductility of the second phase enables one to control the development of shear - bands , thus preventing the nucleation of cracks .",
    "a reinforcement effect is obtained despite the fact that the effective yield stress of the amorphous composite is lowered with respect to that of the matrix .",
    "the understanding of the plastic behavior of amorphous composites thus appears to be crucial in the design of modern materials .",
    "efforts in theoretical and numerical modelling have been recently performed to study the effects of micro - alloying in metallic glasses  @xcite and of the addition of aggregates in asphalt mixtures  @xcite .    from the theoretical mechanics point of view , the determination of effective mechanical properties is a matter of homogenization . while this field has been intensively explored in case of elastic properties  @xcite , results are much more scarce for non - linear behaviors like fracture  @xcite or plasticity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , standard homogenization approaches fail to account for size effects  @xcite .",
    "only the development of strain - gradient theories ( relying on the introduction of an ad - hoc internal length scale ) has so far succeeded to reproduce size dependence  @xcite .",
    "still , these approaches only predict the mean behavior and can not cope with sample - to - sample fluctuations .    here",
    "we develop an alternative approach , based on the recent development of depinning - like mesoscopic models of amorphous plasticity  @xcite .",
    "the modelling of amorphous plasticity and rheology of complex fluids has seen much progress in recent years  @xcite and a family of mesoscopic models  @xcite has emerged that rely on two main ingredients : local plastic thresholds ( amorphous plasticity results from series of local rearrangements of the amorphous structure  @xcite ) and account of elastic interactions ( local plastic events occur in a surrounding elastic matrix and induce internal stresses  @xcite ) .",
    "these models show scaling properties close to the effective yield stress ( here seen as a critical threshold ) and thus exhibit statistical size effects .",
    "another nice feature of these models is their ability to reproduce localization and shear - banding behaviors  @xcite .",
    "the effect of crystalline inclusions in an amorphous matrix has recently been discussed along such lines in ref .",
    "@xcite with a particular emphasis on the localization behavior .    here",
    "we specialize the model recently presented in  @xcite to the case of amorphous composites by considering a binomial distribution of local plastic stress thresholds in order to reproduce the introduction of a fraction of hard particles in an amorphous matrix .",
    "the simplistic model presented in the following will obviously not be able to give a realistic account of the whole richness of the mechanical behavior of amorphous composites .",
    "however results are expected to be generic for this class of materials .    in section  [ model ]",
    "we introduce the model , in section  [ size - effects ] we present the complex size dependence of the yield strength measured on the amorphous matrix and amorphous composites with a growing fraction of particles . in section  [ hardening ] , we discuss the hardening mechanisms at play in amorphous composites and the localization behavior . we emphasize in particular the interplay between the gradual localization of the plastic deformation and the building of a strongly correlated internal stress field . elaborating on the numerical observations , we present in section  [ analytical - model ] an analytical model that accounts quantitatively for the size effects of the effective yield strength of amorphous composites .",
    "mathematical details of the model are provided in a separated appendix .",
    "our main findings are finally summarized in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the modelling of amorphous plasticity has recently given rise to an increasing interest  @xcite .",
    "unlike crystalline plasticity that results from the motion of dislocations of the ordered lattice , amorphous plasticity results from series of localized rearrangements of the disordered structure  @xcite .",
    "such local plastic events induce internal stresses within the surrounding material  @xcite .",

    "the quadrupolar elastic interaction associated with localized plastic events is the essential ingredient of the recent models of amorphous plasticity and/or rheology of complex fluids .",
    "indeed its anisotropic nature is responsible for non - trivial behaviors  @xcite .",
    "in particular the presence of multiple soft modes of the elastic interaction , corresponding to the existence of extended modes of plastic strain which do not induce internal stresses , e.g. , shear bands , is responsible for a complex localization behavior .",

    "@xcite , the system is discretized on a two - dimensional square lattice with a lattice constant that is larger than the typical size of the plastic reorganizations .",

    "a new configuration is thus obtained and the next iteration can be performed .",
    "extremal dynamics  @xcite is a way of driving the system at a vanishing strain rate , very close in spirit to the athermal quasi - static driving used in some atomistic simulations  @xcite . note that the same model can be driven with other kinds of dynamics , e.g. , constant stress , kinetic monte carlo .",
    "a direct outcome of a simulation is the evolution of the external stress @xmath34 versus the average plastic strain @xmath35 , where the average @xmath36 represents the average over the different sites at a particular iteration step .",

    "the following curvature of the stress - strain curve is characteristic of a hardening behavior : if a unloading / loading cycle is performed , a new ( larger ) value of the elastic limit is obtained .",
    "a stress plateau is eventually reached that defines the ultimate flow stress @xmath39 .    in the present framework ,",
    "the external loading is not monotonous .",
    "rather , the external stress @xmath34 is a fluctuating quantity which is adapted at each iteration step so that the criterion of the weakest site is satisfied . the macroscopic flow stress @xmath39 of a given configuration",

    "@xcite , the plastic flow stress can be viewed as a critical threshold between a static phase ( no plasticity ) and a dynamic phase ( plastic flow ) .",

    "<S> the reinforcing mechanisms and their effects on localization are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> plastic strain is shown to gradually concentrate on the weakest band of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation of the plastic behavior with the material structure is used to design a simple analytical model . </S>",
    "<S> the latter nicely captures reinforcement size effects in @xmath0 observed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of the effective flow stress accounting for further logarithmic corrections show a very good agreement with numerical results .    corresponding author : c. a. lemarchand , e - mail : clairel@ruc.dk </S>"
