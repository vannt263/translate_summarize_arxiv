    "gender inequality manifests in objective phenomena , such as salary differences and inequality in academia @xcite , but it also contains a large subjective component that is not trivial to measure .",
    "the philosophical works of simone de beauvoir describe how gender inequality is formulated on top of the concept that women are less rational and more emotional than men @xcite .",
    "this points to the subjective and subconscious component of gender inequality , which prevents many individuals from assessing their own gender biases in their everyday behavior . to a great extent ,",
    "gender inequality is exercised but not consciously reflected upon , creating a pattern of biases that everyone experiences but nobody names @xcite .",
    "gender bias , as part of the culture and ideology of a society , manifest in subconscious behavior and in the fictions created and consumed by that society @xcite .",
    "the emerging field of _ culturomics _ aims at a quantitative understanding of culture at a large scale , first being applied to cultural trends in literature @xcite , but also applicable to other traces of human culture such as voting in song contests @xcite , search trends @xcite , and movies @xcite .    in 1985",
    ", alison bechdel published the comic strip named `` the rule '' , in which a female character formulates her rules to be interested in watching a movie : _ it has to contain at least two women in it , who talk to each other , about something besides a man _ @xcite . while intended as a punchline about gender roles in commercial movies , it served as an inspiration to critically think about the role of women in fiction",
    ". such formulation of a test for gender biases became popularly know as _ _ the bechdel test _",
    "_ , and is usually applied to analyze tropes in mass media . whether a movie passes the test is nothing more than an anecdote , but the systematic analysis of a set of movies can reveal the gender bias of the movie industry .",
    "the bechdel test is used by swedish cinemas as a rating to highlight a male bias , in a similar manner as it is done with violence and nudity .",
    "previous research using this test showed gender bias when teaching social studies @xcite , and motivated the application of computational approaches to analyze gender roles in fiction @xcite .",
    "the current volume of online communication creates a record of human interaction very similar to a massive movie , in which millions of individuals leave digital traces in the same way as the characters of a movie talk in a script .",
    "this resemblance between reality and fiction is the base of the theory of behavioral scripts @xcite , used to analyze subconscious biases through patterns of social interaction @xcite .",
    "for example , linguistic coordination appears in both movie scripts @xcite , and twitter dialogues @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bidirectional interaction in twitter has been proved useful for computational social science , testing theories about the assortativity of subjective well - being @xcite , about cognitive constraints like dunbar s number @xcite , and about conventions and social influence in twitter @xcite .",
    "gender roles in emotional expression appear in myspace dialogues @xcite , and gender - aligned linguistic structures have been found in facebook status updates @xcite .",
    "one of our aims is to compare the patterns of dependence across genders in movies and online dialogues , assessing the question of whether our everyday life , as pictured in our online interaction , would be close to passing the bechdel test or not .",
    "large datasets offer the chance to analyze human behavior at a scale and granularity difficult to achieve in experimental or survey studies . at the scale of whole societies , digital traces",
    "allow the analysis of cultural features , such as future orientation through search trends @xcite , and the similarity between cultures through song contest votes @xcite . at the level of individual behavior ,",
    "online datasets allowed the measure of intrinsic biases , such as that we tend to use more positive than negative words @xcite , that we have a tendency to share information with strong emotional content @xcite , and that apparently irrelevant actions , such as facebook likes , reveal relevant patterns of our personality @xcite .",
    "we introduce a quantitative extension of the bechdel test , to measure female and male independence in the script of a movie and the digital dialogues of a population .",
    "we calculate these metrics based on the amounts of dialogues between individuals of the same gender that do not contain references to the other gender . in our approach , we keep a symmetric analysis of male and female users and characters , quantifying asymmetries without any presumed point of view .",
    "we combine these metrics with information about geographic location , personal profile , and movies viewed by groups twitter users , to take one step further in understanding the conditions under which gender biases appear .",
    "we test the role of climate in the gender stereotypes of a culture , as suggested by previous works that found a relation between the future orientation and the geographic location of a culture @xcite . similarly as the ability to plan ahead is encouraged by adverse climate , it can also encourage gender biases in which males behave more independently and less emotionally attached .",
    "we test this theory , known as the _ disposable male _",
    "@xcite , through the hypothesis that male independence increases with distance to the equator .",
    "additionally , we explore the relation between economic factors and female independence , measuring the relation between the average income of states of the us and the gender independence of its female twitter users .",
    "the centralized nature of movies plays a key role in the persistence of gender inequality in a society , which is part of the concept of cultural hegemony @xcite .",
    "this case is particularly important in movies aimed at children , which are known to have a gender bias that disempowers female characters @xcite . on the other hand , the lack of central control in the content of online media offers the chance of gender unbiased interaction , as conjectured by cyberfeminist theories @xcite . in this article",
    ", we quantify the presence of these biases in dialogues from movies and twitter , testing if these patterns prevail in online communication or are only present in mass media .",
    "to assess the questions mentioned above , we require three main datasources : references from social media to movies , movie script information , and dialogues involving the users that shared information about the movies .",
    "furthermore , we need a set of tools to process these datasets in order to identify the gender of users and actors , to detect gender references from social media messages and movie lines , and to group them into dialogues over which we can analyze gender asymmetries . in the following ,",
    "we outline our datasources and the methods we used for our analysis .      from an initial dataset of youtube videos",
    "@xcite , we extracted a set of 16,142 videos with titles that contain the word `` trailer '' or `` teaser '' , among the categories of movies and entertainment . removing trailer related terms",
    ", we matched these videos to titles of movies in the open movie database ( omdb ) , selecting the pairs in which the string similarity between the titles was above 80% .",
    "after a manual inspection of the results , our dataset contained 704 trailers for 493 movies in 2,970 twitter shares .",
    "in addition , we had the amount of views , likes , and dislikes for these trailers , as retrieved in june , 2013 .",
    "we downloaded scripts from the internet movie script database as text files with the content of each movie , similarly to previous works @xcite . to disambiguate the title of each movie on the site",
    ", we first automated a search through omdb , matching the title of each movie with the imdb identifier of the first result , filtering when title string similarity was above 80% and the year of release differed in no more than one year .",
    "once each movie script was in text form , we identified character lines and scene cuts using the standard syntax used to process screenwriting markup languages , as used by screenwriting software like fountain .",
    "we constructed dialogues between characters following the sequence of their lines , and using the scene cuts as additional explicit separators between dialogues .",
    "second , we developed a set of python scripts to download the bechdel test results form bechdeltest.com , in a similar manner as previously done for visualization purposes .",
    "we gathered bechdel test data for 470 movies with an unique imdb identifier , processing the information in bechdeltest.com to extract two values : a test result @xmath0 indicating how many rules of the test are passed by a movie ( from 0 to 3 ) , and an amount of disagreements in the comments of the users of the site .      using the service provided by gnip , we collected a set of public tweets from the period between june 1st and 6th , 2013 . using the list of youtube videos mentioned above",
    ", we found a set of 536,835 users that shared at least one of the trailers in our dataset . from among those users , we extracted their location information , which we matched with yahoo !",
    "placemaker to select those in the us . as a result",
    ", we got 69,606 _ ego _ users in the us that shared at least one trailer .",
    "for each one of these users , we retrieved their history of tweets with a limitation of 3,200 tweets per user , and their lists of followers and followees with the limitation of 5,000 users in each list . from this set of friendships , we identified those that interacted with the users in our database if they exchanged at least 10 mentions .",
    "filtering by us location again , we extended this set of users with an additional 107,645 _ alter _ users , for which we also got up to 3,200 of their most recent tweets .",
    "this composes a track of the recent history of interactions between more than 170,000 users , over which we constructed dialogues based on the more than 300 million tweets they wrote .",

    "we constructed a network of dialogues between twitter users , based on the mentioning functionality of @-tags . for each tweet , we know its text , the user that created it , the time of creation , and the users that were mentioned in it .",
    "the full track of tweets between two users composes a set of dialogues , in which the users talked about different topics at various moments in time .",

    ", scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for our case , we use the theory of bimodality in human communication @xcite , which states that there are two modes in the interaction between pairs of people : an intra - burst mode in which messages follow each other in a dialogue after very short periods , and an inter - burst mode of long silences between dialogues . figure [ fig : discussionexample ] shows an example of the timestamps of the tweets exchanged between a pair of twitter users .",
    "the head of the distribution of times between messages of a pair of users follows a power - law close to @xmath1 for time intervals in @xmath2 $ ] , and the tail is closer to an exponential distribution of the form @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "note that this bimodal definition is different than a power - law with exponential cutoff , which is typically used to control for finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "the cutoff time @xmath5 gives us an estimate of the time scale of correlations inside a dialogue .",
    "we estimated its value in myspace and twitter through a modified version of the maximum likelihood technique for power - laws @xcite , correcting for the fact that the fit is to the head and not the tail of the distribution .",
    "this method minimizes the kolmogorov - smirnov criterion of distribution equality giving power - law exponents of @xmath6 in twitter and @xmath7 in myspace , very close to previous empirical studies of this kind of distributions in irc channels @xcite .",
    "this method allowed us to compute estimates of the cutoff value @xmath5 between both distributions , which are of 9.1 hours in twitter and 7.7 hours in myspace .",
    "we used the time cutoffs to separate dialogues , applying the rule that times of silence longer that the cutoff indicate the end of a dialogue . as a result ,",
    "our twitter dataset is composed of 2,240,787 dialogues and the myspace dataset of 3,263 dialogues .",
    "an illustration of a subnetwork of the resulting data is figure  [ fig : citynetwork ] , where we show the dialogues between twitter users that declared to live in ann arbor , michigan .",

    "their location information allowed us to find their city and state within the us , which we matched versus the list of the 100 largest cities in the us to identify urban and rural users .",
    "we identified the gender of a user through first name matching against the history of names in the us , classifying the gender of a user in the same way as previously done for twitter @xcite and for authors of research papers @xcite .    for each movie , we gathered the cast list from imdb , and then we looked for the terms `` actor '' and `` actress '' in the imdb profile of the actors playing each character , which determines their gender @xcite .",
    "this data is not only useful to determine the genders of the characters in our movie dataset , but also serve as a ground truth to evaluate the dictionary technique we used for twitter users . in total",
    ", we found 4,970 actors and 2,486 actresses , with 154 unknown ( writers and directors ) .",
    "we applied the above gender detection technique , which gave us the unknown gender class 33% of the time .",
    "note that these actors and actresses do not need to live in the us , and that can have artistic names like _ `` snopp dogg '' _ , who appears in our dataset .",
    "precision values are 0.894 for detecting males and 0.844 for detecting females , and recall values are 0.582 for males and 0.595 for females .",
    "the similarity in these values indicates that this tool does not introduce a bias that changes the ratio of male and female users .",
    "nevertheless , improvements are possible , not only in the lexica , but also introducing machine learning techniques that find more complicated naming patterns @xcite .",
    "we modify the above gender detection technique to find which dialogues include male and female references .",
    "first , we modified the gender lexica used above , filtering out english dictionary words , like `` faith '' , and toponyms .",
    "second , we disambiguated the gender of names that can appear in both genders by the frequency of appearance in each gender in the us .",
    "if a name is used for a gender at least than 5 times more often than for the other gender , we assign it to the lexicon of the gender with the highest frequency , or we remove it otherwise .",
    "second , we add common feminine words like `` her '' , and masculine words like `` him '' . for each dialogue composed by a set of tweets ,",
    "this technique will classify as containing references to males , females , both , or none depending on the presence of common words and names associated each gender .    in our study",
    ", we apply this technique for a very particular subset of dialogues , aiming only at the decision whether male - male dialogues contain female references , and whether female - female dialogues contain male references . to provide an initial validation beyond intuition",

    "we extracted a random set of 100 dialogues between male twitter users that were classified as containing female references and 100 as not containing them , and a random set of 100 dialogues between female users that were classified as containing female references and 100 as not containing them .",

    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : gendindep ] shows that the value of @xmath9 above 0.5 and of @xmath10 below 0.5 reveals a pattern of disassortativity in which users of different genders tend to interact , revealing the use of myspace for dating at the time of the crawl @xcite .",
    "the high ratio of male users in twitter is captured by the dialogue imbalance metric , which shows the large likelihood for a dialogue to involve a male .",
    "for this reason , both @xmath10 and @xmath9 are above 0.5 , indicating that the large male bechdel score of twitter is due to this size difference .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : gendindep ] shows the male and female gender independence ratios , for both myspace datasets ( uk and us ) and twitter . while in myspace these independence ratios were similar for males and females , the male independence in twitter is significantly larger than its female counterpart .",
    "this shows that the asymmetry between the independence of male and female users of twitter remains , even when we control for the amount of gender - aligned dialogues .",
    "this implies a clear bias towards male independence in twitter , despite of not being centrally controlled by any agent .",
    "this is not the case for myspace , where tests of equality of proportions did not allow us to conclude any differences in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "out of those movies , we have bechdel test information for 662 shares from male users and 294 shares from female users . for a subset of those movies we also have script information and bechdel scores , accounting for 264 shares from males and 86 shares from females . from those users ,",

    "the numeric value of the bechdel test ( @xmath0 ) of movies in shares from female users had a larger value than those on the shares by male users ( @xmath17 ) , revealing that women share movies that pass more rules of the bechdel test .",
    "furthermore , a share from a female user is more likely to be about a movie that passes all three rules of the bechdel test .",

    "@xmath11 has a correlation coefficient with average income of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , stronger than with any other metric including male independence . to evaluate if this result is a confound with any other metric , we calculated partial pearson correlation coefficients @xmath27 where @xmath28 is average income and @xmath29 is each of the other variables ( @xmath12 , gini index , latitude and longitude ) .",
    "all partial correlations were negative and significant , being the least significant when controlling for gini index ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) .",

    "for this reason , we replicate the above correlation analysis by computing spearman s correlation coefficient , which tests for a monotonous relation , by reducing the leverage of outliers through a rank transformation of the data .",
    "spearman s correlation between @xmath11 and average income was significant and negative ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "male independence is correlated with latitude , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the same partial correlations analysis as with @xmath11 reveals positive and significant correlations when controlling for all the other factors .",
    "the least significant of these is when controlling for average income ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , showing that latitude is the most related factor with male independence .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : asymmetrydeps ] , states that are farther from the equator have male dialogues that are less likely to contain female references .",
    "normality tests for @xmath12 and latitude did not provide evidence that they are not normally distributed , as shapiro - wilk tests did not reject the null hypothesis for both @xmath12 ( @xmath40 ) and latitude ( @xmath41 )",
    ". nevertheless , we tested the statistical robustness of our finding by computing spearman s correlation between @xmath12 and latitude , finding a significant positive correlation of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we presented a study that combines data from movie scripts , trailers , and casts , and twitter and myspace users , including their profile information and the dialogues among them .",
    "we designed a set of metrics to measure gender biases in the sets of dialogues in movies and social media , to explore the relations between gender roles in fiction and reality .",
    "starting from an equal approach to male and female independence in movies , we verified the existence of a generalized bias in which female characters are shown as dependent on male characters .",
    "furthermore , the trailers of male biased movies are more popular , and the movies shared by twitter users are related to their profiles and patterns of interaction . while we did not find a difference for male users , female users are more likely to share movies with high female bechdel scores , and to interact less with with male users if they share movies that pass the bechdel test .",
    "this indicates that female twitter users are attracted to movies in which women are shown less dependent on men , but also that the audiences might be starting to be aware of the results of the bechdel test itself .",
    "we compare the gender biases in twitter and myspace with our metrics for movies , finding that twitter contains a male bias not only in amount of users , but also in a lower degree of female gender independence .",
    "this points to the possibility that some design decisions of twitter might create undesired effects @xcite , such as hindering female users to engage in the community in the same way as males do .",
    "in addition , the biases present in public dialogues in twitter are not radically different from those in movies .",
    "the decentralized nature of twitter has not led to a gender unbiased interaction with respect to mass media , and the asymmetric pattern of lower female gender independence is also present in everyday online public interaction .",
    "this similarity between reality and fiction can be explained by two mechanisms : i ) the gender roles present in fiction , including movies , influence our behavior and gender bias , or ii ) movies reflect patterns of gender dependence present in real life .",
    "it is also possible that there is a combination of both mechanisms , in which a feedback loop makes movies reflect certain gender bias in everyday life , but also perpetuate gender inequality through the influence of movies in human culture . in any case ,",
    "such subconscious biases are a component of ideology and contribute to the creation of inequality at a large scale @xcite , in the same way as very small racial preferences can lead to segregation @xcite .",
    "we find that certain personal factors are related to the gender independence of twitter users .",
    "this is particularly strong as we did not find evidence for a presence of gender bias among students , and we found urban users to be more gender independent that rural ones , especially for women .",
    "we calculated gender independence values across states in the us , finding a generalized pattern of asymmetry towards lower female independence .",
    "we found a significant correlation between male independence and latitude that is consistent with the theory of the disposable male , which predicates that males behave more independently due to the presence of adverse conditions , including climate .",
    "however , this result is constrained to us states , and further work on a wider range of societies is necessary to understand the relation between climate and gender asymmetries . in addition",
    ", we found a negative relation between female gender independence and average income , counter intuitively to the concept that female emancipation increases the workforce and the productivity of a society .",
    "note that our finding is structural , not measuring changes in average income or gdp due to changes in female independence , and that they are consistent with the observation that richer countries show larger gender bias in scientific production @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation lies in the difference between the political discourse regarding gender independence and the subjective behavior of a society : labeling oneself as liberal in gender policies does not necessarily imply an absence of a gender bias in everyday behavior . on the other hand , this result also points to the role of twitter in society , as publicly articulated dialogues might emphasize certain ideals of gender equality in the places where they are needed the most .",
    "all these questions are empirically testable in future research , in particular if focused on individual income and education levels , world views , and gender biases quantified in observed behavior .",

    "<S> the subjective nature of gender inequality motivates the analysis and comparison of data from real and fictional human interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we present a computational extension of the bechdel test : a popular tool to assess if a movie contains a male gender bias , by looking for two female characters who discuss about something besides a man . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the tools to quantify bechdel scores for both genders , and we measure them in movie scripts and large datasets of dialogues between users of myspace and twitter . comparing movies and users of social media , we find that movies and twitter conversations have a consistent male bias , which does not appear when analyzing myspace . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the narrative of twitter is closer to the movies that do not pass the bechdel test than to those that pass it .    </S>",
    "<S> we link the properties of movies and the users that share trailers of those movies . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals some particularities of movies that pass the bechdel test : their trailers are less popular , female users are more likely to share them than male users , and users that share them tend to interact less with male users . </S>",
    "<S> based on our datasets , we define gender independence measurements to analyze the gender biases of a society , as manifested through digital traces of online behavior . using the profile information of twitter users , we find larger gender independence for urban users in comparison to rural ones . additionally , the asymmetry between genders is larger for parents and lower for students . </S>",
    "<S> gender asymmetry varies across us states , increasing with higher average income and latitude . </S>",
    "<S> this points to the relation between gender inequality and social , economical , and cultural factors of a society , and how gender roles exist in both fictional narratives and public online dialogues .    </S>",
