    "frozen gases are a new and in some ways ideal laboratory to test and refine our understanding of quantum theory in a complex system . with laser technology ,",
    "the translational temperature of the gas can be lowered to the point where it can be ignored when discussing electronic processes , and at the same time one can manipulate and detect these processes in the gas with an extraordinary selectivity and precision .",
    "frozen rydberg gases have the added advantage that their states are well understood and electronic processes occur on a microsecond time scale , easily allowing for time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "these gases provide an excellent means of studying many - body effects , because the dipole - dipole interactions which are important for binary collisions at room temperature are still dominant in the frozen gas , but now involve many atoms that are , to a first approximation , standing still .",
    "pioneering experiments on resonant processes in frozen rydberg gases have been carried out by anderson _",
    "et al._@xcite and mourachko _ et al._@xcite .",
    "the work presented here was motivated , in part , by the desire to understand those experiments and the subsequent work of lowell _ et al._@xcite highlighting the dynamic aspects of these resonant , many particle systems .",
    "the measurements of refs .",
    "@xcite are of mixtures of @xmath2 atoms initially prepared in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , henceforth to be called the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , respectively .",
    "there are initially @xmath7 atoms in the @xmath5 state and @xmath8 atoms in the @xmath6 state .",
    "the transition @xmath9 is monitored , where @xmath10 refers to a @xmath11 state and @xmath12 refers to a @xmath13 state , at and near resonance .",
    "what is measured is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of atoms in the @xmath12 state after an elapsed time @xmath16 .",
    "( measuring @xmath17 gives nothing really new , since @xmath18 at all times . ) some of the experimental features we wish to understand are the rapid rise followed by slow approach to saturation of the signal and the width of the resonance lineshape ( in the detuning @xmath19 ) as a function of time .",
    "the problem is not trivial because an initial @xmath20 transition is followed by the propagation of @xmath21 and @xmath22 fluctuations , which are responsible for the broadening of the resonance .",
    "although we address specifically the rb experiments , the theory we present here is broadly applicable to analogous processes in any frozen gas of excited atoms .    in an earlier",
    "paper@xcite we developed the general formalism , obtained exact results for the case when resonance broadening is negligible , and introduced simple approximations for the broadening .",
    "the same formalism and notation are used in this paper . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite we introduced the down and up states of an effective spin to describe the states @xmath5 and @xmath10 , and similarly for @xmath6 and @xmath12 , but in this paper we prefer to describe an @xmath23 transition as the creation of a frenkel exciton@xcite , which then propagates through the medium . in this language , the initial creation of a @xmath24 pair launches two excitons , of types @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but we consider only the limit where the propagation of the @xmath27 exciton is relatively unimportant and can be neglected .",
    "we prefer the exciton language because the literature on excitons in solids and liquids generally considers the dipole - dipole forces to be of major importance , as they are in a frozen rydberg gas , and this literature has been useful to us in developing approximate analytical treatments . on the other hand , in spin systems the dominant role",
    "is usually played by the short - ranged exchange interaction and dipole - dipole forces are given comparatively little attention .",
    "in this paper we present the results of numerical simulations for the case where @xmath28 and @xmath7 is large , which corresponds to the situation where a single @xmath6 atom is initially present and a single @xmath25 exciton is launched by the resonant @xmath20 transition .",
    "the calculated @xmath15 can be directly compared to the experimentally determined @xmath14 in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "when exciton propagation is suppressed , exact results are obtained by the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite and serve as a check on the numerical simulations .",
    "we also develop analytical approximations for the average amplitude of a resonant transition and compare them with the results of the simulations .",
    "we find that the cayley tree approximation agrees well with the simulations for a broad range of conditions , and is much better than the simple lorentzian approximation introduced in ref .",
    "the details of the numerical simulations are briefly outlined in section  [ simulation ] .",
    "analytical approximations for the transition amplitude and for the exciton spectral density are developed in section  [ analytical ] .",
    "remarkably , explicit formulas are obtained in the cayley tree approximation .",
    "representative graphs of the results , both numerical and analytical , are shown and discussed in section  [ results ] , which is followed by the conclusions .",
    "before discussing how the simulations are carried out , we review the basic elements of the theory presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we consider one atom at the origin , initially in the state @xmath30 , in interaction with a gas of @xmath5 atoms through a resonant @xmath31 dipole - dipole interaction @xmath32 .",

    "clearly , the asymmetry of the spectral density at @xmath141 comes from the terms with @xmath205 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ gfv ] ) , which are neglected in the cayley approximation .",
    "it is surprising that these terms , which correspond to exciton propagation other than back and forth on the cayley tree , have such small effect on @xmath132 at @xmath171 . at finite @xmath69 ,",
    "the underestimate of @xmath206 for @xmath204 is probably due to the neglect of these same terms .",
    "it seems complicated to include these terms , even approximately , in the cayley tree formulation , but we have already shown how this can be done in the `` cpa '' approximation@xcite .      the time - dependent resonance lineshape is obtained from the ordinates of the curves in fig .",
    "[ azero2 ] at a given @xmath146 .",
    "in general the lineshape is not lorentzian , but we never find a split line with a minimum at resonance as reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus it is fair to characterize the line by its fwhm .",
    "this can not be directly compared with an experimental width , which is usually the fwhm of a lorentzian fitted to a noisy experimental line , but it is indicative of trends . for a more accurate comparison with experiment , one should of course convolute the calculated lineshape with the broadening from other effects .",
    "[ widthvst ] shows one half of the fwhm , @xmath207 , as a function of @xmath146 for @xmath140 .",
    "one sees the typical decrease of @xmath207 from a universal @xmath208 behavior at small @xmath146 towards an asymptotic value , which is almost reached at @xmath209 .",
    "the @xmath208 law , which results simply from the uncertainty principle , has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where on the basis of a small @xmath69 expansion it was estimated that @xmath210 for small @xmath16 .    the near - asymptotic value of @xmath207 at @xmath209 is shown in fig .",
    "[ widthratio ] as a function of @xmath137 .",
    "overall , the graph is roughly linear except at small @xmath137 , although a careful examination shows that there are really two linear regimes with somewhat different slopes that meet at @xmath211 .",
    "there is an unexpected minimum around @xmath192 , which is not a numerical artifact , but can be seen directly from fig .",
    "[ azero2 ] by comparing the plot for @xmath192 with those for @xmath149 and @xmath170 .",
    "what happens is that the resonance line always grows taller and wider as @xmath115 increases , but for small @xmath115 its height ( the signal at @xmath212 ) grows faster than its width .",
    "in this paper , we report results of ongoing work on the general question : what are the electrodynamics and the optics of a gas of excited atoms interacting via dipolar fluctuations , for times short compared to the atom - atom collision time ?",
    "we are considering in particular the time evolution of a resonant @xmath213 process when @xmath7 atoms in state @xmath5 and @xmath8 in state @xmath30 are initially present , and all atoms are randomly distributed .",
    "at least one of these two initial states must be an excited state for the process to occur resonantly .",
    "other resonant processes can be mapped on this prototype .",
    "for instance , the process @xmath214 discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is handled by setting @xmath215 and reversing the roles of @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "if the atoms are in rydberg states then they have known energies and dipole moment matrix elements and the dipole - dipole interaction is dominant , so there are no adjustable parameters in the theory . more importantly for the experiments , with a frozen gas of rydberg atoms",
    "one can easily do time - resolved spectroscopy because the evolution time scale is measured in microseconds .",
    "however , for the theory it does not matter that the atoms are of rb or cs , since other atoms in excited states would behave similarly on the corresponding time scale . in the language of the solid - state and chemical physics literatures , our problem can be described as resonant energy transfer to frenkel excitons .",
    "we have carried out detailed and extensive calculations , truly `` computer experiments '' , for a resonant @xmath216 process when a single @xmath30 atom is initially present in a frozen gas of @xmath5 atoms . neglecting the propagation of the @xmath217 exciton to keep things simple , we consider in effect the resonant excitation and propagation of an @xmath25 exciton .",
    "the results apply , in practice , whenever only a few excitons of a given type are created , so that exciton - exciton interactions are negligible .",
    "we can compute anything we wish about this system , but in this paper we report representative results for two quantities only : the average probability amplitude that no exciton has been created , @xmath132 , and the average probability that an exciton has been created , @xmath218 .",
    "one striking result is that the initial transition rate for this process is independent of exciton propagation and of detuning from resonance for surprisingly long times , and can thus be explicitly evaluated .",
    "another notable feature is that the transition amplitude at detuning @xmath69 shows persistent oscillations with period @xmath69 , in particular when exciton propagation is a strong effect , as for @xmath140 .",
    "correspondingly , the spectral density for exciton creation is strongly peaked at @xmath69 , and becomes narrower as @xmath115 increases .",
    "thus , the universal phenomenon of line narrowing actually simplifies the problem in the experimentally interesting limit of strong coupling ( @xmath219 ) .    with a wealth of numerical results at our disposal ,",
    "we have attempted to develop approximate formulas that are not simply fits to a particular numerical result .",
    "we have obtained good approximations for @xmath132 , but not yet for @xmath220 , which is notoriously more difficult to obtain than @xmath221 and quite different from @xmath222 . to develop approximation schemes",
    "we have drawn , and will continue to draw , from the literature on wave functions in random systems , and in particular on earlier work on excitons in disordered solids and liquids@xcite .",
    "the best results , in our case , are given by the cayley tree approximation .",
    "most of the work on random systems deals with on - site disorder or short - range interactions . on the contrary",
    ", the dipolar interaction @xmath223 is long range and has the distribution @xmath224 for a random distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of the cumulative variable @xmath225 , where @xmath226 , plays a major role in the theory .",
    "it is given by @xmath227 where @xmath115 is given by the appropriate equivalent of eq .",

    "therefore it is not surprising that , as shown by the simulations , the distribution of eigenvalues and other statistical properties of the matrix @xmath39 are very different from those of a standard random matrix .",
    "this implies that random system results obtainable by random matrix theory are not applicable to dipolar interactions in an ideal gas .",
