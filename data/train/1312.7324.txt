    "the set of chain recurrent points of @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , it contains the set @xmath21 of periodic points of @xmath10 .    the notion of a chain recurrent point plays an important role in dynamical systems .",
    "some general properties of it can be found , e.g. , in books  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive literature devoted to generic properties of maps involving chain recurrency and relative notions , where they were studied mainly for diffeo- or homeomorphisms on smooth or pl - manifolds ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "denote by 0-@xmath0 the family of all compacta @xmath1 such that the set @xmath3 is 0-dimensional for a generic map @xmath13 .",
    "it is known that all finite graphs and pl - manifolds are in class 0-@xmath0 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , resp . ) .",
    "generalizing these results , we prove in section  [ poly ] that all finite polyhedra belong to class 0-@xmath0 . in section  [ lc ] , we show that all locally connected , 1-dimensional continua are elements of 0-@xmath0 , as well . moreover , using a small - retractions - technique , we derive similar results for all menger compacta , compact hilbert cube manifolds and some important non - locally connected continua .",
    "the technique also gives us immediately that all countable ( finite or infinite ) products as well as cones and suspensions over these compacta are members of 0-@xmath0 .",
    "a stronger property of a generic map @xmath10 , of having @xmath3 homeomorphic to the cantor set @xmath22 , is formulated in  @xcite for pl - manifolds ( the proof in  @xcite , however , is only barely sketched at the very end of the memoir ) . in section  [ per ]",
    "we provide a short proof that @xmath3 has no isolated points for a generic map @xmath2 if @xmath1 is a perfect anr or @xmath1 is a perfect @xmath8-dimensional @xmath9-compactum ; moreover , if such @xmath1 has the local periodic point property , then @xmath21 has no isolated points and is dense in @xmath3 ; moreover , for each integer @xmath23 , periodic points of periods @xmath24 form a dense subset of @xmath3 . in particular , if @xmath1 is a finite polyhedron , a compact hilbert cube manifold , a local dendrite or a finite product of these spaces , then @xmath3 is a cantor set containing @xmath21 as a dense subset for a generic @xmath10 .",
    "sometimes we can also claim that a generic self - map is zero - dimensional .",
    "this is true in the cases of anr - compacta with coinciding finite dimensions @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the piecewise embedding dimension in the sense of  @xcite , menger manifolds and countable products of locally connected curves , among others .",
    "finally , we observe that a measure - theoretical result of  @xcite that @xmath3 is of measure zero for a generic map @xmath13 , if @xmath1 is an @xmath8-dimensional @xmath9 perfect compactum equipped with a borel , finite , non - atomic measure , extends on all mentioned above compacta .",
