    "in the eulerian description of the motion of an incompressible , homogeneous newtonian fluid , the momentum and the continuity equations for fluid dynamics are @xmath0 where the velocity vector @xmath1 has the components @xmath2 , the scalar quantity @xmath3 is the pressure , the space variable is denoted by @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the laplacian .",
    "the density and the viscosity of the fluid are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the kinematic viscosity is @xmath8 .",
    "these equations are known as the navier - stokes equations .",
    "they are derived on the basis of the continuum hypothesis .",
    "we seek the solution of ( [ ns ] ) as an initial - boundary value problem in the space - time domain denoted by @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 has a smooth impermeable boundary @xmath11 .",
    "the initial condition is given by @xmath12 and the no - slip boundary condition is @xmath13    the equations of motion ( [ ns ] ) are often re - written in dimensionless form @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the reynolds number with reference to a characteristic length scale and a characteristic velocity .",
    "a prevailing concept is that there exist some basic flows , such as plane poiseuille flow and the hagen - poiseuille flow in a circular pipe , which are  exact \" solutions of the navier - stokes equations , though these basic flows are in fact the solutions of _ simplified _ equations of motion .",
    "nevertheless , one important implication is that the basic flows exist at all reynolds numbers .",
    "in fact , the stability of a flow depends essentially on this idea which quantifies the growth or decay of disturbances as the reynolds number varies , as a parameter . in the present note",
    ", we show that approximating or simplifying the equations of motion without due justifications can be very misleading , as the solutions of the approximated equations are inconsistent in the spatio - temporal evolution of fluid motion .",
    "let us consider plane poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel with half width @xmath16 . as in many textbooks on fluid mechanics , we make the following assumptions for the flow : @xmath17 the momentum equation becomes an ordinary differential equation @xmath18 the _ time - independent steady _ solution of the boundary value problem is given by @xmath19    alternatively ,",
    "we seek navier - stokes solutions by assuming @xmath20 now the flow evolution is an initial - value problem : @xmath21 its solution defines a class of _ space - independent unsteady _ flows , @xmath22 which complements solution ( [ ppf ] ) by space - time symmetry .",
    "both solutions ( [ ppf ] ) and ( [ ghost ] ) may be regarded as exact particular solutions of the navier - stokes equations , only in a restrictive sense .",
    "moreover , plane poiseuille flow is considered to exist at arbitrary reynolds number @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the velocity at the channel centre and @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , we claim that the unsteady solution ( [ ghost ] ) is valid for all unit reynolds number @xmath26 .    strictly speaking , the correctness of the profile ( [ ppf ] )",
    "must be tested experimentally by intelligent beings squatting absolutely on space while supernaturals crawling in time may be able to verify the flow ( [ ghost ] ) !    for a straight circular pipe of radius @xmath27 , we have the analogous expression to ( [ ppf ] ) : @xmath28 this is known as the hagen - poiseuille flow .",
    "in fact , we have no _ a priori _ justifications to detach space from time or vice versa , as implied in the simplification ( [ ppf - cond ] ) or ( [ ghost - cond ] ) .",
    "every fluid motion develops in space _ as well as _ in time . since we have separately considered the initial - boundary data ( [ ic ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) , neither ( [ ppf ] ) nor ( [ ghost ] ) can be regarded as correct descriptions of the evolution .",
    "practically , the velocity profile ( [ hpf ] ) is accepted as  correct \" because there are experimental verifications ( hagen 1839 ; poiseuille 1840 ) even though these experiments ought to have been carried out _",
    "locally_. within the experimental errors , the parabolic profile agreed with the measurements of ensemble averages .",
    "the experiment repeats and the data sampling must have been undertaken over time , though the time - dependence may not be shown in an explicit formulation .",
    "we recall that the first theoretical explanation of ( [ hpf ] ) in circular tubes was not done by solving equations but was derived by poiseuille by considering the momentum balance ( see , for example ,  331 of lamb 1975 ) over a fully developed flow or a transient with no reference to its initial condition .",
    "the question is , to what extent , can we ignore the temporal effects ?",
    "instead of ( [ ppf - cond ] ) , we postulate @xmath29 , \\ ; \\epsilon>0 , \\;\\;\\ ; v = w=0 , \\;\\;\\ ; u = u(y , t),\\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{and } \\;\\;\\ ; p = p(x , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath30 stands for starting time , and @xmath31 denotes a short interval .",
    "the start refers to either the initialisation of a motion from rest or a subsequent moment when the assumed uni - directional flow has been established at least over a part of the apparatus .",
    "the second option is more relevant to experimental measurements because the flow at the inlet may be specified as initial data . with these understandings , we set @xmath32 .",
    "we consider the following initial - boundary value problem : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scaled pressure gradient ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the solution of this diffusion problem is well - known , ( see , for example , carslaw & jaeger 1947 ) , @xmath36 where green s function is given by @xmath37 for all time @xmath38 $ ] , and in general @xmath39 . for constant pressure gradient @xmath40 , the second integral in ( [ ppf - ibp ] )",
    "is found to be @xmath41    consider the particular initial profile at a location closed to the inlet @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a given constant , its contribution to the solution is given by @xmath44    we make the following assertions :    * in view of ( [ ppf - q0 ] ) and ( [ ppf - id ] ) , the subsequent flow development of initial data ( [ i d ] ) is steady over a _ short time interval _ if @xmath45 the solution can be expressed as @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "( [ ppf ] ) ) , by virtue of the fourier series expansion for functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 over @xmath49 . * for @xmath50 in ( [ i d ] ) ,",
    "the flow is time - dependent .",
    "however , the following approximation is valid . within a short time",
    "@xmath51 or for small viscosity @xmath52 such that the exponential decay has virtually no influence .",
    "measurements made at a small distance downstream must be very close to the initial data , as implied in ( [ ppf - id ] ) .",
    "the small viscosity requirement is relevant to many experiments using air ( @xmath53 in si units , @xmath54 ) and pure water ( @xmath55 ) under the conditions of standard temperature and pressure .",
    "* for an arbitrary initial velocity @xmath56 of a polynomial satisfying the boundary conditions , the flow is unsteady in general .",
    "if we ignore the contribution from the pressure gradient over the short - time interval @xmath31 , the flow downstream of the inlet resembles the initial data , in the limit of @xmath57 , according to fourier series expansions for simple functions .",
    "if we consider the following modification of the boundary conditions in ( [ ppfns - ibp ] ) : @xmath58 we obtain the solution for plane couette flow : @xmath59 where @xmath60 if the boundary conditions are time - independent , the last integral can be evaluated as @xmath61 let us consider several particular cases of our general solution :    * an impulsively started motion @xmath62 , with zero pressure gradient and boundary conditions @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "+ in view of ( [ pcf - ibp ] ) and ( [ pcf - bdy ] ) , the time - independent solution of this motion is plane couette flow , @xmath65 evidently , the viscosity plays a key role in determining how soon the temporal effects may be neglected . * a motion driven by the upper boundary @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) with initial data @xmath62 and zero pressure gradient .",
    "+ the solution is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 in practice , this result may only be realised within a short period of time after the sinusoidal force has been applied since the non - linearity can not be ignored , especially for large @xmath70 . * a motion driven by @xmath71 and @xmath72 with zero initial data and zero pressure gradient .",
    "+ in view of the last solution , we find @xmath73 the solution can be considered as a model for simulating the effect of wall vibrations in experiments if we choose small amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath74 .",
    "more complicated flows can be generated and analysed if we include non - zero initial data and time - dependent pressure gradients .",
    "in a cylindrical co - ordinates system @xmath75 , consider @xmath76 .",
    "the velocity components in the radial and circumferential directions are hypothesised as identically zero over time @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the axial component is treated as a function of the independent variables @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 by analogy , the differential equation for hagen - poiseuille flow in a circular pipe of radius unity becomes ( see , for example , batchelor 1973 ) @xmath80 where we seek bounded solution , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 denotes the axial pressure gradient .",
    "the solution of the initial - boundary value problem can be expressed in terms of the bessel functions of orders zero and one , @xmath83 where green s function is given by @xmath84 where the constants , @xmath85 are the positive zeros of @xmath86 .",
    "the first few of them are @xmath87 the other zeros may be calculated by making use of the asymptotic formula @xmath88 in particular , none of these zeros coincides with any zero of @xmath89 .",
    "bessel functions @xmath90 are entire functions of the argument @xmath91 ( watson 1944 ) , @xmath92 explicitly , @xmath93 we notice that @xmath94 as @xmath91 tends to @xmath95 , @xmath96 tends to @xmath95 , and @xmath97 .",
    "evidently , the flow evolution reaches a steady state in the interval @xmath31 if @xmath98 when @xmath99 for some @xmath100 ( say ) . the smallness assumption for @xmath101",
    "may be justified for air and water . practically , the uni - directional flow can only be observed during an interval @xmath102 measured in seconds under normal laboratory conditions .",
    "thus the temporal effects due to the exponential decay reduces to the extent when any experimental measurements of the flow become time - insensitive .    in view of the identity , @xmath103 the integral involving the bessel functions in green s function may be evaluated , particularly for the initial condition having a  parabolic \" distribution .    assuming a time - independent pressure gradient , the second term in ( [ hpf - ibp ] ) contributes nothing as @xmath57 .",
    "thus the solution due to the initial data , @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 where we have performed the necessary calculations .",
    "the leading constant term converges quickly to @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "the coefficient for @xmath108 is defined by an alternating series .",
    "we first choose @xmath109 and extrapolate these results to @xmath110 to get @xmath111 .",
    "we then repeat the process using @xmath112 to get @xmath113 . by the minimal computational effort",
    ", we verify that the coefficient does equal to unity by considering the mean value ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "in fact , if the initial velocity has a more general profile , @xmath115 the time - insensitive solution can be computed in a similar manner .",
    "consequently , we may contemplate that poiseuille s measurements ought to be the transient of well - controlled initial parabolic profiles , which can be generated and maintained by a fixed pressure gradient during the tests .",
    "szymaski ( 1932 ) considered flow development from an impulsively started motion from rest .",
    "he derived @xmath116 where it is assumed that the pressure gradient is zero for @xmath117 , and approaches to a constant as @xmath118 .",
    "the hagen - poseuille flow is recovered as @xmath119 . in reality , solution ( [ szy ] ) is misleading as it implies that the approximation ( [ hpfns - ibp ] ) holds for arbitrarily long time . for air and water",
    ", the duration for the unsteady effect to disappear altogether must be in the order of @xmath120 seconds ! on the contrary , high - reynolds - number streamlined flows in pipes",
    "have only been observed in _ brief periods of time _ and over _ finite space_. ( reynolds 1883 ; pfenninger 1961 ; mullin 2011 ) , especially for fluids of small viscosity .",
    "one possible way out of the dilemma ( [ szy ] ) is to adopt our idea of the limit @xmath98 .",
    "the first term on the right is in fact the second term in ( [ hpf - ibp ] ) which is showed to be negligible in the short time limit . in practice",
    ", it is very difficult to apply a constant pressure gradient right from the beginning of the motion",
    ". the initial flow will be highly unsteady and its life span is likely too short to determine suitable modifications for subsequent repeats ( so as to achieve a constant pressure gradient ) .",
    "however , it is relatively easy to produce established or full - developed flows , at least over a portion of the pipe , driven by an adjustable pressure gradient .",
    "we may continuously operate our apparatus to maintain a constant flow rate for sufficiently long time .",
    "numerous experiences show that it is crucial to control the flow conditions near the pipe inlet in order to achieve a parabolic profile over useful distance downstream . in this sense ,",
    "our theory is more general than the impulsively started scenario .",
    "naturally , to maintain a uniform parabolic profile over the whole cross - section at the inlet is extremely difficult ; the entry velocity is likely the combination of a normally parabolic distribution and a swirling component .",
    "we postulate that @xmath121 over time @xmath38 $ ] . here",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath122-dependence of the pressure is a result of accelerating the flow into the inlet , possibly from a large fluid container , so that an equivalent body force @xmath123 is generated .",
    "let @xmath124 and @xmath125 be the components in the @xmath77 and @xmath122 directions respectively .",
    "thus we must have @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "the equation of motion has a simple form of @xmath128 the solution for the initial - boundary value problem can be written as @xmath129 where green s function @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 the constant @xmath132 is the @xmath133th positive zero of @xmath134 ( watson 1944 ) .",
    "the derivatives of the bessel function can be evaluated from the recurrence relations @xmath135 suppose that the initial data near the pipe inlet can be expressed as @xmath136 in the limit of @xmath137 and a constant axial pressure gradient , the leading order approximation by keeping the first sum in ( [ swirl - green ] ) is proportional to the angular integral of @xmath138 .",
    "the resulting profile remains parabolic with modified strength .",
    "for the full effects of swirl , we must include the double sum and the analysis becomes much more involved in general though it is a matter of computation .",
    "the parabolic profile is not the only uni - directional time - insensitive flow achievable in a straight pipe .",
    "if the pressure gradient is allowed to vary as a non - linear function of @xmath91 , a whole range of flow profiles , possibly with strong swirls , may be generated ( see , for example , pfenninger 1961 ) .",
    "the short - time evolution of these flows can be explained by our solution ( [ hpf - ibp ] ) and ( [ swirl - ibp ] ) as long as we have an adequate knowledge of the initial data @xmath139 and the pressure near the pipe inlet .",
    "in this section , we present some numerical results for various initial data at the entrance of a long rigid circular pipe ( the radius is assumed to be unity ) . the profile given in solution ( [ hpf - ibp ] )",
    "is normalised by quantity @xmath140 , and we write the scaled velocity as @xmath141 where the first term on the right stands for the effect of scaled inlet data , @xmath142 , and the second term is induced by the green function at constant axial pressure gradient .      in figures [ pprof ] and [ pprof2 ] ,",
    "we show two examples where the initial velocity distribution is a parabolic type or a hagen - poiseuille - couette type , while the pressure gradient is nominally constant to maintain a constant mass - flux through the pipe . if we assume that a motion is set up impulsively from rest , the flow development under the constant pressure gradient is in fact the solution of an impulsively started motion from a parabolic velocity obtained by szymaski ( 1932 ) where the scaled profile is given by ( cf . equation ( [ szy ] ) ) @xmath143 this is the solution presented in the middle rows in figures [ pprof ] and [ pprof2 ] .",
    "the computed results show that _ initial data with parabolic distributions do not describe the flow regimes over the entry length_. specially , the viscous layers at pipe wall are mis - represented .",
    "in addition , parabolic profiles at pipe entry are difficult to generate in practice .",
    "if the entry profiles are of boundary layer type , as shown in figures [ blprof ] and [ blprof2 ] , the developed velocity downstream of the entry resembles the well - known experimental measurements ( see , for example ,  2.5 of tritton 1988 ) .",
    "a parabolic velocity profile can only be realised in the limit of @xmath144 or at locations far downstream of the entry as long as the axial pressure variation is kept constant .",
    "we show one example of inlet flow with swirl with the natural period in the azimuthal direction : @xmath145 as assumed in the present theory , the swirl is generated by an body force near the pipe entrance and the subsequent flow has a constant mass - flux or a constant axial pressure gradient . because of the @xmath122 rotational symmetry in green s function ( [ swirl - green ] ) , the second contribution in ( [ swirl - ibp ] ) is identical to the non - swirl cases just examined .",
    "hence only the computational results of @xmath146 are presented in figure [ swprof ] where , clearly , the overall flow field has certain `` symmetries '' and is substantially more complicated to analyse",
    ". we shall carry out detailed investigation in separate studies .",
    "we have shown that , by including @xmath147 term in the equations of motion , the uni - directional flow in a channel ( [ ppf - ibp ] ) or in a pipe ( [ hpf - ibp ] ) is _ space - time - dependent _ and exists over a short time when the equations are solved with _",
    "non - zero _ initial data .",
    "the classical plane poiseuille flow ( [ ppf ] ) or hagen - poiseuille profile ( [ hpf ] ) are best interpreted as an evolutional solution of an appropriate initial velocity in the limit of @xmath98 .",
    "this point has been heuristically argued by lam ( 2013 ) on the basis of exact vorticity solutions in @xmath148 .",
    "the subsequent development over longer periods must be governed by the full equations of motion where the non - linearity becomes dominant .",
    "it has long been known that , by neglecting the non - linear term @xmath149 , the approximate fluid motions are only valid for low reynolds numbers , see , for example ,  110 of prandtl & tietjens ( 1934 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to understand why there do not exist absolute steady flows , independent of initial data , at arbitrary reynolds numbers .",
    "our flow regimes are clearly outside the physics of relativity , the concept of space - time entity enables us to recognise the conceptual inconsistency in the formulas ( [ hpf ] ) or ( [ ppf ] ) .",
    "although the differences in the spatio - temporal solution ( [ hpf - ibp ] ) and the absolute steady flow ( [ hpf ] ) appear to be insignificant with reference to experimental verifications , particularly for fluids of small viscosity , the hydrodynamic principles underlying the two fluid motions have important ramifications .",
    "for instance , the linear stability analysis for the non - dimensional parabolic profile shows that the basic flow is stable to all infinitesimal disturbances ( see , for example , lam 2014 ) . by this counter - example",
    ", one casts serious doubts on the relevance of the linear stability theory in explaining the process of laminar - turbulent transition . could it be something fundamental which may have gone wrong ?",
    "if the basic flow evolves in space _ and _ time , what is the meaning of its stability or instability when the reynolds number itself is varying ?",
