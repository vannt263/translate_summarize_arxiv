    "in the conventional sequential accretion hypothesis ( sah ) for gas giant planet formation@xcite , heavy elements first coagulate into planetesimals and proto - planetary embryos . when they attain a critical mass @xmath0 , they begin to accrete gas efficiently and to evolve into gas giants @xcite .",
    "perhaps the strongest supports for sah are the inferred existence of solid cores and super - solar metallicity in the envelopes of solar - system gas and ice giants @xcite .",
    "these models are constructed to match the observed masses , radii , and moments of inertial of present - day jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune .    despite this verification , theoretical explanations",
    "are needed for two observed properties : 1 ) a significant difference in the core mass between jupiter and saturn and 2 ) the super - solar metallicity in the envelopes of gas giants . in  2 , we discuss the uncertainties and pose challenges to the most simple version of sah introduced by these two puzzles .",
    "we suggest that the dispersion in the core mass and the enhanced metallicity in the envelope of gas giants may be the consequence of some catastrophic collisional events which occurred well after the onset of efficient gas accretion .",
    "we discuss the common occurrence of giant impact and merger ( gim ) events during the formation of isolated and multiple proto gas giants as well as throughout their long - term dynamical evolution .",
    "we carry out numerical simulation to demonstrate that gim s can indeed lead to diverse planetary structures . in  3 , we briefly describe our numerical methods and discuss the typical range of appropriate orbital parameters and planetary properties . with a smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) scheme ,",
    "we illustrate the possibility that sufficiently massive protoplanetary embryos may be able to intrude through the massive envelope and impact onto the cores of some gas giants . with three examples of head - on ,",
    "parabolic collisions between a saturn - like gas giant with super - earth embryos or another gas giant , we show that spherical symmetry is quickly restored after the the cores of the merger products are thoroughly mixed .    in order to extend the simulation to a larger dynamical range in density and over protracted phases of dynamical evolution",
    ", we construct an spherically symmetric lagrangian hydrodynamic ( lhd ) scheme . with this lhd scheme ,",
    "we consider , in  4 , impactors with a range of masses and head - on collisional speeds .",
    "we show that low - velocity and low - mass impactors generally disintegrated in the gaseous envelope of gas giants and their debris has a tendency to sediment towards the planets cores .",
    "such events lead to the enlargement of the core mass .",
    "however , large - mass and high - speed impactors can survive their passage through the gaseous envelope and reach the gas giants core .",
    "the dissipation of kinetic energy into internal energy induces efficient and vigorous thermal convection and erosion of the cores .",
    "these diverse outcomes may be responsible for introducing a variety of internal structure for long - period gas giants . in a follow - up paper ii @xcite",
    ", we will apply a similar scenario to a series of models for short period planets with diverse internal structures .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "in the sequential accretion hypothesis collisions represent a principal mode of growth and planetary evolution .",
    "giant planetary collisions have been suggested to explain a variety of bulk planetary characteristics in the solar system , including the origin of earth s moon , collisional stripping of mercury s primordial mantle @xcite and uranus large obliquity @xcite .",
    "giant impacts during the accretion epoch display a diversity of outcome morphologies , each with different implications for the development of planetary characteristics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies have begun to explore how these energetic impacts influence the luminosity , detectability and characteristics of extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "here we build on these works and examine how giant planetary collisions may account for the diversity of the interior structure of gas giant planets , and the differences in core mass between jupiter and saturn in particular .    in this section ,",
    "we provide arguments to highlight the critical roles of giant impacts and mergers during the formation and evolution of gas giant planets and the potential outcomes of such events .",
    "although they are both classified as gas giants , jupiter and saturn have very different internal structures . within considerable uncertainty ,",
    "the estimated core mass of saturn is more massive ( by up to three times ) than that of jupiter .",
    "in contrast , jupiter s total mass ( which is mostly contained in its envelope ) is around three times that of saturn .",
    "the average metallicity of both planets are inferred to be several times that of the sun , albeit they are unlikely to be identical .    according to sah",
    ", gas giants acquired their cores prior to the accretion of their gaseous envelopes .",
    "current quantitative models indicate that a critical core mass ( @xmath1 ) is needed for the onset of efficient accretion of the surrounding gas @xcite .",
    "this mass is determined by the heat transfer efficiency @xcite and the nebula boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "there are considerable uncertainties on the magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "the first sets of quantitative models were constructed under the assumptions of spherical symmetry , hydrostatic equilibrium , efficient convection , interstellar - grain opacity , and idealized planetesimal bombardment rate @xcite .",
    "these models indicate that uninterrupted planetesimal bombardments and a cooling barrier can delay the formation of jupiter in a minimum mass nebula ( mmn ) by 10 - 20 myr",
    ".    however , gas giants can only acquire their massive envelope inside gas - rich protostellar disks , _",
    "i.e. _ their formation time scale @xmath3 must be smaller than the typical gaseous disk depletion time scale @xmath4 ) .",
    "there have been several previous attempts to resolve this theoretical challenge .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that type i migration of earth - mass embryos ( ward 1997 ) may speed up the time scale needed for the onset of efficient gas accretion .",
    "although this scenario may provide a solution for saturn ( because its core is relatively massive ) , it may not be appropriate for jupiter if its core mass is limited to a few @xmath5 .    in an attempt to account for jupiter s low - mass core",
    ", @xcite constructed models to show that the gas accretion rate increases with the heat transport efficiency . since there are radiative regions in proto gas giants envelope , the critical mass for the onset of efficient gas accretion increases with the opacity of the infalling envelope .",
    "the main sources of opacity in these regions are grains .",
    "grain growth and formation of planetesimals can reduce the opacity of residual disk gas substantially ( see  [ sec : envelo ] ) .",
    "it is also possible for dust to coagulate and sediment from the tenuous outer envelope of proto - planets @xcite .    in principle",
    ", these effects can suppress the barrier for the onset of gas accretion .",
    "however , a rich population of super - earths ( with masses @xmath6 a few @xmath5 ) has been discovered with radial - velocity @xcite and transit @xcite surveys .",
    "some of these super - earths have masses larger than jupiter s estimated core mass ( at least for some models ) .",
    "this discrepancy would introduce a paradox , if we assume these super earth attained their present - day mass and became `` failed cores '' in gas - rich protostellar disks because their mass @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible that the onset of gas accretion onto these super - earths may be delayed by planetesimal bombardment , albeit such events are likely to be suppressed by the formation of a gap in the planetesimal disk ( see  [ sec : embryosdyn ] , @xcite ) .",
    "although this accretion time scale issue is not the central focus of our discussion here , scenarios proposed for its resolution have implications which exacerbate the second paradox , _",
    "i.e. _ gas giants structural diversity .",
    "if the internal structure of the mature planets is assumed to be the result of some critical conditions that led to their formation , the large observed dispersion would imply the existence of many possible paths for their final assemblage .",
    "for example , both jupiter and saturn probably formed in a similar solar nebula environment close to their present - day location ( albeit at different times ) .",
    "it is natural to assume a similar magnitude for @xmath8 for the onset of efficient gas accretion , especially if their separation may have widen through planetesimal scattering since their formation @xcite .",
    "the dichotomy of their internal structure is indicative that it only partially reflects the critical initial condition for the onset of efficient gas accretion .",
    "it is entirely possible that the present - day internal structure of gas giants has been affected by some local or temporal stochastic processes after they have initiated ( or terminated ) the process of rapid accretion of their massive envelope .",
    "a related conundrum is the super - solar metallicity content of jupiter and saturn s gaseous envelope . in the sah ,",
    "heavy elements are assumed to be mostly condensed into grains , efficiently segregated from the disk gas , and converted into planetesimals , embryos , and cores prior to the onset of the gas accretion .",
    "the abundance distribution of refractory elements in the meteorites suggests that the solar nebula had an initial composition similar to that of the sun .",
    "the emergence of solid cores with @xmath9 would decrease the nebula s overall metallicity , including contribution from molecules and grains .",
    "if gas giants envelopes are composed solely of nebula gas and grains accreted by their cores , they would attain a sub - solar metallicity .",
    "this inference clearly contradicts with the observed super - solar metallicity in jupiter and saturn s envelopes .",
    "one possible solution for this paradox is that jupiter and saturn formed in regions where heavy elements are locally enhanced . due to hydrodynamic drag",
    ", grains formed in the outer disk regions migrate inward .",
    "they may stall and accumulate near the snow line ( @xmath10 where the disk mid - plane temperature decreases below ice condensation temperature at 160k , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this migration barrier to grains and embryos provides a preferred location for gas giants to assemble @xcite ( see  [ sec : jupsat ] ) .",
    "however , a strong metallicity enhancement would increase the effective opacity of gaseous envelopes around solid cores and the magnitude of @xmath8 @xcite well beyond the current estimated core mass for jupiter @xcite .",
    "although coagulation and sedimentation of grains in protoplanets envelopes may provide a potential solution for jupiter s small core @xcite , it is not clear why such a process did not also enable saturn to attain a small @xmath8 and low core mass .",
    "another possible cause of the high metallicity in gas giants envelopes is the erosion of their cores .",
    "however , such a scenario would require much more massive cores ( up to @xmath11 ) prior to the onset of efficient gas accretion . in a mmn , formation of",
    "such massive embryos is challenging though not impossible .",
    "core erosion by convective gas may also be suppressed by the compositional gradient in the boundary layer separating gas giants cores and envelopes @xcite .",
    "this scenario can also be easily ruled out by any dip in the planetary mass distribution in the range of @xmath12 @xcite .      in this paper , we propose giant impacts of residual embryos onto gaseous planets during and after the advanced stages of their envelope accretion as a potential mechanism which may lead to the resolution of the structural diversity ( see  [ sec : struct ] ) and metal - rich envelope ( see  [ sec : envelo ] ) . in order to distinguish between the _",
    "ab initial _ core and the giant - impact scenarios , we first discuss the dynamical evolution of massive embryos in the context of gas giant formation .",
    "the growth of embryos is limited by their isolation mass ( ( @xmath13 , see",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and long growth timescale ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . in a mmn - type protostellar disks ,",
    "the most massive embryos emerge beyond @xmath14 within the gas depletion timescale ( @xmath15 ) is @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the onset of gas giant formation is challenged by the type i orbital migration of their super - earth embryonic cores .",
    "the rate and direction of type i migration is determined by both the surface density ( @xmath17 ) and temperature @xmath18 ( more accurately the entropy ) gradient in the disk gas @xcite .",
    "these quantities are determined by the efficiency of turbulent - induced angular momentum transport .",
    "possible causes of turbulence include the magneto - rotational ( mri ) @xcite and convective @xcite instabilities .    near the snow line of a mmn ,",
    "the ionization fraction near the disk midplane is negligible and the gas there is unaffected by mri turbulence .",
    "however , the ionization fraction may be much higher near the disk surface layers which are exposed to the ionizing photons from the central stars and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the depth of layers which are affected by the mri turbulence is determined by an ionization equilibrium in which the ionization rate is balanced by the rate of recombination on the grains .",
    "interior to @xmath14 , the sublimation of volatile ices eliminates a majority of the recombination sites , enhances the ionization fraction of the disk gas , and increases the depth of the surface layer which is regulated by mri turbulence . across @xmath14 , effective viscosity has a negative gradient , which in quasi steady state , leads to a positive gradient in @xmath17 and @xmath19 . for a range of disk mass accretion rates ( @xmath20 yr@xmath21 ) ,",
    "the local @xmath19 maximum at @xmath14 provides a natural barrier for the orbital decay of grains against hydrodynamic drag @xcite .",
    "this structure also reverses the direction of type i migration due to the effect of horseshoe drag @xcite .",
    "outward migration of embryos by a few au may also be induced by an entropy gradient @xcite .",
    "thus , similar to grains orbital evolution , embryos migration leads to them to congregate near @xmath14 where both the gas surface density ( @xmath17 ) and pressure ( @xmath19 ) attain local maxima in the disk due to the transition in the efficient turbulent angular momentum transport . through the accumulation of neighboring embryos and",
    "planetesimals a protoplanet may acquire sufficient mass ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) to evolve into a core which efficiently accretes gas @xcite .      during the early phase of gas accretion , the time scale for a proto - planet to double its mass is longer than the synodic periods ( relative to its orbit ) of planetesimals and embryos within its feeding zone .",
    "its tidal perturbation on the nearby embryos and their interaction with the disk gas induces their orbit to evolve away from that of the dominant proto - planet @xcite .",
    "therefore slowly ( `` adiabatically '' ) growing proto - planets can not accrete those embryos within their expanding feeding zones in contrast to the assumption made in previous models @xcite .",
    "this initial suppression of giant impacts reduces the energy released by the growing proto - planet and promotes the gas accretion rate . in the limit of negligibly small thermal feedback and weak proto - planetary torque , proto - planets uninhibited gas accretion rate ( @xmath23 )",
    "may be approximated by the bondi formula such that the mass doubling time scale would be @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the disk thickness .",
    "the above expression indicates that , once it is initiated , bondi - type gas accretion is a runaway process . during their growth",
    ", there are several effects which can lead to gim events :    a1 ) proto gas giants accretion rate @xmath23 is eventually suppressed by the structural changes in their natal disks induced by their tidal perturbation when their @xmath26 exceeds @xmath27 , which is comparable to @xmath28 in a mmn near @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , just before they have acquired an adequate mass to induce gap formation , proto - planets @xmath3 reduces below a thousand years @xcite , which is comparable to the synodic periods of their nearby planetesimals and embryos ( with semi major axis @xmath29 ) .",
    "gas giants rapid ( non adiabatic ) mass increases destabilize these embryos orbits and a modest fraction of these objects collide with and are captured by the emerging gas giants @xcite .",
    "a2 ) after gas giants accretion is quenched by gap formation , their gravity perturbs the orbital elements of residual planetesimals and embryos out to quite large distances . to the lowest order , gas giants secular perturbation leads to the modulation of the embryos eccentricity and the precession of their longitude of periastron .",
    "the amplitude of embryos eccentricity modulation increases with gas giants eccentricity @xmath30 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "many known gas giants have significant @xmath30 s and they can induce modest amplitude eccentricity modulations among their nearby embryos .",
    "embryos orbital precession frequency is determined by their @xmath31 s .",
    "due to the self gravity of their natal disks , orbits of gas giants and residual embryos also precess with frequencies determined by their @xmath31 s relative to the @xmath32 distribution of the disk .",
    "secular resonances occur at special locations where the embryos precession frequencies due to the gravitational perturbation of the gas giants matches their differential precession frequencies due to the disk potential . in these resonances ,",
    "embryos eccentricities can be greatly excited by the nearly constant differential longitude of periastrons . during the depletion of the disk",
    ", gas giants secular resonances sweep over wide regions and destabilize the orbits of the planetesimals and embryos at these locations @xcite . some embryos may cross the orbits of and collide with the gas giants .      there are two gas giants , jupiter and saturn , in the solar system .",
    "several stars ( such as @xmath33 and ) have known multiple planets around them . around other planet - bearing stars ,",
    "there are indications of additional planetary companions with comparable @xmath26 s @xcite . in these systems with multiple planets ,",
    "there are several additional avenues which may lead to catastrophic impacts of residual embryos onto their envelopes .",
    "for example :    a3 ) regardless of the low formation and survival probability of the first - generation planets @xcite , their birth leads to gap formation which provide a secondary pressure maximum in the gas disk outside their orbits @xcite .",
    "this induced disk structure also sets up a barrier against the orbital decay of grains and embryos .",
    "the accumulation of heavy elements beyond the outer edge of the gap promotes the formation of more - distant second - generation cores on time scales much shorter than that required for them to assemble in isolation @xcite . in this sequential formation scenario ,",
    "the second - generation gas giants rapid mass increase , during their advanced growth phase , also introduces non - adiabatic changes in the systems gravitational potential which have a tendency to destabilize the orbits of the nearby residual embryos .",
    "a4 ) after the gas depletion , planets orbits continue to evolve due to their scattering of residual planetesimals .",
    "if multiple planets orbits have spread out from a more compact configuration , orbital instabilities and scattering amongst giant planets may also lead to late accretion of planetesimals by gas giants @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to examine the structure adjustment of gas giants envelopes after major merger events rather than a statistical study on the coalescence probability .",
    "we do not consider collisions in which the intruding embryos pass through the envelope of gas giants without losing a significant fraction of their heavy elemental masses . for merger models , we choose representative rather than a realistic distribution of models to illustrate the possibility and character ( rather than probability ) of two sets of outcomes , _",
    "i.e. _ the intruding embryos either disintegrate in the gas giants envelope or impact onto their cores .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider mostly head - on collisions .",
    "impacting planetesimals much smaller than the giant planet would likely suffer ablative disintegration during their passage through the gaseous envelope . on the other hand",
    "sufficiently massive impactors may penetrate deep and reach the core .",
    "a projectile s disintegration becomes likely when it collides with an air - mass comparable to its own @xcite . for head - on collisions ,",
    "the distance traveled in a gas giant s envelope before disintegration is approximately @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the average density of the embryo and gas giant , and @xmath37 is the radius of the embryo . reaching the center of a planet ( @xmath38 ) requires a sufficiently large or massive impactor ( @xmath39 ) . for saturn - like gas giant planets ( @xmath40 g @xmath41 ) hit by condensed rocky embryos (",
    "@xmath42 g @xmath41 ) reaching the core becomes feasible for impactors of @xmath43 or larger .",
    "we note that the length of the path to the core , the air - mass encountered and hence the embryo mass required to reach it all depend on the impact orientation .",
    "further , the depth at which an impactor s mass and energy is deposited is sensitive to the impact orientation @xcite .      in relatively massive disks ,",
    "the formation of multiple systems may lead to merger events due to the following effects :    b1 ) the emergence of the second - generation gas giants can perturb the orbit of their predecessors and induce them to undergo type iii runaway migration @xcite . during this phase of rapid orbital evolution ,",
    "planets orbits may be dynamically destabilized even though they are surrounded by considerable amount of disk gas ( @xcite , also see  [ sec : embryosdyn ] ) .",
    "b2 ) after the depletion of the disk gas , long - term dynamical instabilities induced by all the gas and ice giants on each other ( and the embryos ) can lead to their eccentricity excitation and orbit crossing @xcite on a time scale @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mean orbital period of the planets , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the ratio of the semi major axis between planets @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the modified hill s radius @xmath50 takes into account the mass of two interacting proto - planets@xcite .",
    "b3 ) eccentricity growth and orbit crossing widen planets feeding zones but reduce their collisional cross sections to its geometric values .",
    "close encounters can eventually lead to velocity dispersions comparable to the planets surface escape speed @xmath51 .",
    "interior to the region where the planets keplerian orbital velocity @xmath52 , they undergo repeated close encounters until they eventually collide with each other @xcite .",
    "having established that gims are expected to commonly occur among long - period gas giants , we use two methods to simulate giant impacts between gas giants and planetesimals and mergers between two planets . in the first method , we model collisions into gas giant planets using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "it is a lagrangian particle method suitable for modeling highly deformed flows and shocks evolving in three dimensions . because it only tracks material particles of interest , modeling flows into empty space",
    "can be done economically without the need for including vast volumes of all potentially occupied space as in a grid type code .",
    "this versatile boundary - free multi - dimensional hydrodynamic scheme is well suited for the simulations of colliding astrophysical and planetary bodies .",
    "a few dynamical times after a giant impact , the gross deformation gravitationally settles back to a new roughly symmetrical equilibrium shape . over short timescales and for densities near that of the planet , the sph model provides a good description of the planetary response .",
    "we examine the long term thermal adjustment of the gaseous envelope using a 1d ( spherically symmetric ) lagrangian radiative hydrodynamic scheme .",
    "sph is widely used for modeling flows in a variety of astrophysical and planetary contexts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews of the method ) .",
    "it has been used for a variety of problems including modeling stellar collisions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as impacts between condensed solar system objects @xcite .",
    "the model we use here employs a hierarchical tree to compute self - gravity and is a variant of the code used in @xcite .    to simulate impacts into gas giant planets with cores , we must model the hydrodynamic response of both condensed and gaseous matter .",
    "we construct model planets using the tillotson @xcite equation of state ( see appendix ii of @xcite ) with the material parameters of iron to simulate the structure of the condensed core . the algebraic expression of this equation of state is convenient for use in sph schemes .    we treat the giant planet s gaseous envelope using a perfect gas equation of state , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath19 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the pressure , density and specific internal energy respectively and we have used @xmath56 . gas giant planetary models are constructed by surrounding an iron core with a gaseous envelope and letting the system relax to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium . in regions with modest density , the smoothing length is adjusted to maintain a specific number of neighbors . for numerical convenience ,",
    "we employ a lower limit on the density of @xmath57 such that the expansion of the smoothing length is suppressed for particles with density below this value .",
    "this density `` floor '' prevents gas in the individual fragments ( or the envelope ) from dispersing and diffusing out to tenuous medium .",
    "since there is limited envelope expansion and very little mass loss associated with models presented here , this numerical prescription does not affect our results .",
    "finally , we model large planetary impactors using the tillotson material parameters for both iron and basalt . in principle , impactors might be primarily composed of water ice .",
    "impactors composition for a given mass can determine whether they disintegrate or impact onto the core .",
    "as we are simply interested in illustrating the gross characteristics of merger events ( rather than numerically measuring the critical impactor mass or impact parameter which determine specific outcomes ) our main conclusions are not strongly tied to the particular material properties chosen ( e.g.  basalt , iron , ices ) or the use of head - on vs the more common oblique collisions for particular impact models .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : section2 ] , impactors into gas giant planets range from planetesimals and embryos to full grown planets . to explore a few of these possibilities ,",

    "<S> however , jupiter s gaseous envelope is more massive and core may be less massive than those of saturn . in order to account for this structural diversity and the super - solar metallicity in the envelope of jupiter and saturn , we investigate the possibility that they may have either merged with other gas giants or consumed several earth - mass proto - planetary embryos during or after the rapid accretion of their envelope . in general , </S>",
    "<S> impinging sub - earth - mass planetesimals disintegrate in gas giants envelopes deposit heavy elements well outside the cores and locally suppress the convection . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , their fragments sediment to promote the growth of cores . through a series of numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible for colliding super - earth - mass embryos to reach the cores of gas giants . </S>",
    "<S> direct parabolic collisions also lead to the coalescence of gas giants and merging of their cores . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the energy released from the impact leads to vigorous convective motion throughout the envelope and the erosion of the cores . </S>",
    "<S> this dichotomy contributes to the observed dispersion in the internal structure and atmospheric composition between jupiter and saturn and other gas giant planets and elsewhere . </S>"
