    "the experimentally measured @xcite fermi surfaces for the surface states of flat semi - infinite slabs of the three - dimensional topological insulator differs at moderate fermi energies from the circular cross sections of dirac cones predicted by the dirac fermion hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the surface normal to the slabs . in order to reproduce the experimentally observed fermi surfaces , fu introduced a hexagonal warping term to the hamiltonian based on the symmetries of the underlying crystal structure @xcite .",
    "the modified effective hamiltonian for the surface states of the flat slab now reads as @xmath2    liu _ et al _ subsequently derived a four - band effective hamiltonian @xcite which describes both the bulk as well as surface states near the dirac point of the family of tis , of which is a member .",
    "they noted that fu s hexagonal warping term can also obtained from the model hamiltonian .",
    "we showed in an earlier work @xcite that the additional hexagonal warping term in a flat slab leads to the distortion of the fermi surface and the opening of a bandgap by an _ in - plane _ magnetization , both of which would not have occured in the absence of the hexagonal warping term .",
    "these and the displacement of the fermi surfaces by the in - plane magnetization lead to a complex profile of the transmission from an unmagnetized source segment to a magnetized drain segment , as a function of the magnetization direction and the electron energy .",
    "besides flat slabs and flakes , another common morphology for experimentally grown ti nanostructures is the nanowire @xcite , which can approximately be described as a cylinder .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the surface states of a ti cylinder _ without _ the hexagonal warping term has been derived to be @xcite @xmath3    the surface states of a ti cylinder differ from those of the flat ti slab in two important aspects .",
    "first , the circumference of the cylinder imposes periodic boundary conditions on the surface states along the azimuthal direction .",
    "second , the curvature along the circumference of the cylinder leads to a position dependent normal vector to the surface .",
    "this in turn leads to a position dependent spin orbit interaction field , which is reflected by the presence of the @xmath4 term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the above observations motivate us to analyze the combined effects of the of the hexagonal warping term together with a cylindrical geometry in nanowires .",
    "moreover , whilst the effective hamiltonian for the surface states of a cylindrical ti nanowire has already been derived,@xcite the hexagonal warping terms have been neglected in the derivation .",
    "thus in this work , we derive the effective hamiltonian for the surface states of a nanowire which now includes the hexagonal warping term starting from the four - band hamiltonian of liu _ et al_. to test the accuracy of the effective surface state hamiltonian , we compare the bandstructure from the hamiltonian with that from the full four - band hamiltonian , and show reasonable matching between the two bandstructures .    as an example applicatin of the surface state hamiltonian , we study the transmission between two magnetized in different directions perpendicular to the cylinder axis .",
    "the hexagonal warping term leads to a dependence of the energy-@xmath5 relation on the magnetization direction in the plane of the cylinder circumference .",
    "this in turn results in a sawtooth transmission profile in the transmission between two cylinders magnetized in different directions , a feature which may be of utility in achieving multiple - state magnetic memory bits .",
    "we take as our starting point the model four - band hamiltonian in eqs . 16 and 17 of ref .",

    "the @xmath9 s can be interpreted as describing the orbital degree of freedom and the @xmath10 terms the real spins .",
    "this hamiltonian can be derived based on the symmetries exhibited by the underlying crystal structure of the family of tis , and describes both the bulk as well as surface states .",
    "( the subscript ( 4b ) stands for `` 4-band '' . )",
    "we first derive the two - band effective hamiltonian for the surface states of a ti ( ) cylinder with its axis parallel to the @xmath11 direction without the @xmath12 and @xmath13 terms ( i.e. without the hexagonal warping ) , and incorporate the effect of curvature by an approach modified from imura _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "this would yield a hamiltonian compatible to the usual dirac hamiltonian of eq . .",
    "the general idea is to first split the four - band hamiltonian @xmath14 , which describes both the bulk and surface states , into two parts which we call the perpendicular hamiltonian @xmath15 and parallel hamiltonian @xmath16 for short .",
    "the first part contains momentum operators perpendicular to the surface , and the second part momentum operators parallel to the surface .",
    "we know that the surface states exist near the zero - energy dirac point where the energy contribution due to the perpendicular hamiltonian is minimal .",
    "in other words , the energy of these states should come only from the momentum of the particles moving on the surface .",
    "we hence find the zero energy ground states of the perpendicular hamiltonian which are localized near the surface , and then treat the parallel hamiltonian as a perturbation to the perpendicular hamiltonian ground states .",
    "the ground states are degenerate due to the presence of the orbital and spin degrees of freedom . according to degenerate perturbation theory ,",
    "the first order effects of a perturbation are given by projecting the perturbing hamiltonian in the basis of the degenerate ground states .",
    "the parallel hamiltonian projected into the basis of the degenerate ground states thus yields the effective hamiltonian for the states localized near the surface .    in detail , we first identify @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc . , to rewrite eq . in cylindrical coordinates",

    "is that @xmath36 and @xmath37 need to be of differing signs .",
    "it is conventional to choose @xmath36 to be negative , in which case @xmath38 is negative . as @xmath38 is negative and @xmath39 is positive , the only consistent solution for @xmath34 is to choose @xmath40 .",

    "we now proceed to derive the effective hamiltonian on the surface state of the cylinder .",
    "we first consider @xmath55 [ where the  0\" in the subscript denotes the absence of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 hexagonal warping terms in eq . ] . from this",
    ", we extract the hamiltonian @xmath56 that corresponds to motion parallel to the surface of the cylinder [ i.e. , the terms which are not already included in @xmath57 in eq . ] : @xmath58    we then project @xmath56 into the subspace spanned by @xmath59 , the zero - eigenstates of @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , we treat @xmath60 as a perturbation to @xmath15 .",

    "coincides with the usual rashba form of the dirac fermion hamiltonian @xmath69 on the surface of the cylinder expanded out in cylindrical coordinates with the identification of @xmath70 except for the presence of the additional @xmath71 term .",
    "the latter has been interpreted as a manifestation of the spin berry phase @xcite but can be ignored for most transport calculations as a constant shift in energy .    finally , we consider the remaining terms in eq . that have not yet been dealt with , and which correspond to the warping terms , i.e. @xmath72    these terms require a bit more subtlety to handle as they contain @xmath20 and its derivatives .",
    "we often see the momentum in the @xmath73 direction being written as @xmath74 , so that the expectation value of the momentum at position @xmath73 gets written as @xmath75 .",
    "we should , however , recognize that @xmath75 is actually @xmath76 where we are taking the expectation value of the _ non - hermitian _",
    "operator @xmath77 with respect to the state @xmath78 .",
    "this does not lead to any problems when @xmath79 where @xmath80 is real , but yields a complex value where @xmath80 is complex .",
    "this contravenes the fact that an expectation value which corresponds to a physical measurement should yield a real value .",
    "the most natural way around this is to modify the expression for the momentum to @xmath81 .",
    "the preceding discussion is relevant for the case of a ti cylinder because the @xmath20 dependence of the @xmath59 states take the form of @xmath82 which can be interpreted as a wave with a complex wavevector .",

    "the steps outlined in the previous section can generally be applied to reduce a full 4-band hamiltonian to a @xmath54 surface state hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , the surface state hamiltonian for a flat ti slab with warping term in eq .",
    ", as obtained by fu , can be obtained from the full hamiltonian in eq . by following the same procedure , but with the ti cylinder replaced by a ti",
    "crystal truncated perpendicular to the @xmath11 direction , as we briefly outline in the appendix .",
    "we then find that the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "correspond to @xmath39 and @xmath12 in eq .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath39 in both refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] match within 10% ( @xmath88versus @xmath89 , respectively ) and we shall use the latter value for our numerical calculations .",
    "the values of @xmath12 , however , differ by a factor of 5.5 ( @xmath90@xmath91 versus @xmath92@xmath91 ) between the two works .",
    "we assume the value of @xmath12 to be 5 times the latter value in our numerical calculations .",
    "this value is chosen as it is intermediate between the values quoted in the two works , but closer to towards that in ref .",
    "[ ] which was obtained by comparison to actual experimental data , and hence may be deemed to be more reliable .",
    "in this section , we compare how well the effective two - band hamiltonian of eq . for the surface states",
    "replicates the surface states obtained via the full four - band hamiltonian of eq . .",
    "to accomplish this , we write the spatial parts of the latter in the basis of the normalized eigensolutions to the two - dimensional cylindrical coordinate laplacian equation which vanish at @xmath24 , thereby satisfying the boundary condition that the eigenstate wavefunctions go to 0 at the surface of the cylinder .",
    "these eigensolutions @xmath93 are indexed by the quantum numbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 which carry the usual quantum mechanical interpretations of the @xmath11 and total angular momentum respectively , and are given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath94 , and @xmath98 its @xmath95th zero .",
    "( a theorem in elementary quantum mechanics states that the eigenstates for a hermitian hamiltonian form a complete basis set , so we do not need to consider states proportional to @xmath99 for @xmath100 . ) the resulting matrix is then diagonalized numerically to yield the energy eigenvalues .",
    "there is a technical caveat that has to be considered in evaluating the matrix elements involving the third order derivatives in @xmath20 , which occur in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 hexagonal warping terms .",
    "for example ,",

    "the calculation of the dispersion relations with the full four - band hamiltonian enables us to compare how well our effective two - band hamiltonian approximates the surface states of the four - band hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation also establishes the energy and wavevector ranges above which bulk states start to emerge , and would invalidate any transport calculations based on the two - band hamiltonian , which considers only the surface states .    fig .",

    "the depicted edge states are two - fold degenerate , i.e. , each distinct line in the figure represents two states . in both panels of the figure , there is evidently a significant mismatch between the dispersion relations of the two - band and four - band hamiltonians if the hexagonal warping terms of the two - band hamiltonians were neglected ( green dots ) .",
    "on the other hand , the dispersion relations obtained by the effective surface state hamiltonian of eq . show a reasonably close fit with those obtained by the full hamiltonian of eq . at small @xmath5 and at energy values",

    "the energy values of the transmission profiles ( left ) and dispersion relations ( right ) are aligned to facilitate comparison .",
    "we have also drawn lines linking the energy at which key features in the transmission profile emerge with their corresponding features in the band diagrams . ]",
    "we first consider panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ gcombmrx ] which corresponds to the smaller magnetization magnitude . at energies below slightly more than @xmath136 , theew is only one propagating mode in both the source and drain .",
    "the transport in this regime exhibits the conventional magnetoresistance where the transmission is highest for parallel magnetizations between the source and drain , and lowest for the antiparallel configuration . at energies lying between slightly more than @xmath136 to about @xmath137 the transmission exhibits the anomalous magnetoresistance in ref .",
    "[ ] . the band - bending near @xmath138 results in the transmission at antiparallel configuration being higher than at intermediate configurations between parallel and anti - parallel source and drain magnetization configurations .",
    "brieftly , the anomalously high transmission at antiparallel transmission occurs because for a given direction of current flow , the states whose bands bend for a given magnetization direction , are localized at the same angular positions around the cylinder circumference as those states whose bands do not bend for the opposite magnetization direction . the overlap between the angular postions of where the wavefunctions have the largest ampltidue of the bent bands on one side , and the unbent bands on the other side , of the source - drain interface lead to increased transmission from the source to the drain and hence the anomalously high transmission @xcite . in contrast , at higher energies above approximately @xmath139 in panel ( a ) where band bending does not occur we have again the conventional magnetoresistance .    a ` sawtooth ' profile of high transmission at @xmath140 appears in a narrow energy range between about @xmath141 to slightly less than @xmath142 .",
    "the emergence of this sawtooth pattern is due to the variation of the energy of the band bottom of the band emerging at this energy range with the drain magnetization direction  the narrow tip of each high transmission ` tooth ' at each integer @xmath143 @xmath144 corresponds to the drain magnetization direction at which the band bottom has the lowest value of energy . at higher values of energy",
    "the band bottoms of the bands which subsequently emerge do not vary as much with the drain magnetization direction , and the bands no longer bend upwards at small @xmath123 .",
    "this leads to a conventional magnetoresistance behavior at high energies . comparing now between panels ( b ) and ( a ) , we see that the larger magnetization in ( b ) results in more extensive bending of the lower energy bands at small @xmath123 .",
    "this results in a larger energy range over which the anomalous magnetoresistance appears .",
    "the larger variation of the energy of each band with the magnetization angle also leads to a larger energy range for the sawtooth transmission profile .",
    "the sawtooth transmission profile may possibly be of utility as a four - state magnetic memory element .",
    "the magnetic memory element may be biased and gated so that the total current is given by the energy integral over an energy range falling within the sawtooth transmission profile regime ( about @xmath145 to @xmath146 ) , and the 4 states represented by the drain magnetization lying in @xmath125 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the sawtooth transmission profile then leads to a relatively large difference in current between memory states represented by adjacent values of the drain magnetization directions ( e.g. between @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) while retaining a current difference large enough between the @xmath152 and @xmath151 , and @xmath153 and @xmath154 pairs , to be able to robustly distinguish between the four states .",
    "in this work we derived the two - band effective hamiltonian for the surface states of a nanocylinder incorporating the hexagonal warping terms .",
    "we calculated the dispersion relations from the underlying four - band hamiltonian and saw that the energies at which the bulk states emerge is only weakly dependent on the cylinder diameter .",
    "the dispersion relations calculated from the two - band hamiltonian match those of the four - band hamiltonian reasonably well .",
    "the dependence of the dispersion relation on the angle at which the magnetization is applied perpendicular to the cylinder axis gives a rich transmission profile between two cylinders magnetized in different directions .",
