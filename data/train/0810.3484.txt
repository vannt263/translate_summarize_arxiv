    "a fitness landscape of a combinatorial problem can be seen as a graph whose vertices are the possible configurations .",
    "if two configurations can be transformed into each other by a suitable operator move , then we can trace an edge between them .",
    "the resulting graph , with an indication of the fitness at each vertex , is a representation of the given problem fitness landscape .",
    "doye  @xcite has recently introduced a useful simplification of the fitness landscape graph for the energy landscapes of atomic clusters .",
    "the idea consists in taking as vertices of the graph not all the possible configurations , but only those that correspond to energy minima . for atomic clusters",
    "these are well - known , at least for relatively small assemblages .",
    "two minima are considered connected , and thus an edge is traced between them , if the energy barrier separating them is sufficiently low . in this case",
    "there is a transition state , meaning that the system can jump from one minimum to the other by thermal fluctuations going through a saddle point in the energy hyper - surface .",
    "the values of these activation energies are mostly known experimentally or can be determined by simulation . in this way",
    ", a network can be built which is called the `` inherent structure '' or `` inherent network '' in  @xcite .",
    "we use a modification of this idea for studying the well - known @xmath0 combinatorial landscapes . in our case ,",
    "a vertex of the graph is a local maximum , and there is an edge between two maxima if they lay on adjacent basins .    in the context of meta - heuristics",
    ", it is important to identify the features of landscapes that would influence the effectiveness of heuristic search",
    ". such knowledge may be helpful for both predicting the performance and improving the design of meta - heuristics . among the features of landscapes known to have a strong influence on heuristic search ,",
    "is the number and distribution of local optima in the search space .",
    "an interesting property of combinatorial landscapes , which has been observed in many different studies , is that on average , local optima are very much closer to the global optimum than are randomly chosen points , and closer to each other than random points would be . in other words ,",
    "the local optima are not randomly distributed , rather they tend to be clustered in a `` central massif '' ( or `` big valley '' if we are minimising ) .",
    "this globally convex landscape structure has been observed in the @xmath0 family of landscapes @xcite , and in many combinatorial optimisation problems , such as the traveling salesman problem @xcite , graph bipartitioning @xcite , and flowshop scheduling @xcite .    in this study",
    "we seek to provide fundamental new insights into the structural organization of the local optima in combinatorial landscapes , particularly into the connectivity and characteristics of their basins of attraction , using @xmath0 landscapes as a case study . to achieve this , we first map the landscape onto a network , and then analyze the topology of this network for a number of small @xmath0 landscape instances for which complete networks can be obtained .",
    "our analysis is inspired , in particular , by the work of doye  @xcite on energy landscapes , and in general , by the field of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "the study of complex networks has already permeated the evolutionary computation field .",
    "specifically , in the study of scientific collaborations @xcite , the structure of a population in cellular evolutionary algorithms @xcite , and the evolution of networks of cellular automata @xcite . however , our study is the first attempt , to our knowledge , of using network analysis techniques in connection with the study of fitness landscapes and problem difficulty in combinatorial optimization .",
    "the next section introduces the study of complex networks , and describes the main features of _ small - world _ and _ scale - free _ networks .",
    "section [ landscapes ] describes how landscapes are mapped onto networks , and includes the relevant definitions and algorithms .",
    "the empirical network analysis of our selected @xmath0 landscape instances is presented in section [ analysis ] , whilst section [ conclusions ] gives our conclusions and ideas for future work .",
    "the recent interest in the study of networks and networked systems was influenced by the seminal paper by watts and strogatz @xcite , who showed that many real - world networks are neither completely ordered nor completely random , but rather exhibit important properties of both .",
    "some of these network properties can be quantified by simple statistics such as the clustering coefficient @xmath1 , which is a measure of local density , and the average shortest path length @xmath2 , which is a global measure of separation .",
    "it has been shown in recent years that many social , biological , and man - made system show what has been called a _ small - world _",
    "topology @xcite , in which nodes are highly clustered yet the path length between them is small .",
    "a second important aspect in the study of networks has been the realization that in many real - world networks , the distribution of the number of neighbours ( the degree distribution ) is typically right - skewed with a `` heavy tail '' , meaning that most of the nodes have less - than - average degree whilst a small fractions of hubs have a large number of connections .",
    "these qualitative description can be described mathematically by a power - law @xcite , which has the asymptotic form @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the probability of a randomly chosen point having a degree @xmath4 decays like a power of @xmath4 , where the exponent @xmath5 ( typically in the range @xmath6 $ ] ) determines the rate of decay .",
    "a distinguishing feature of power - law distributions is that when plotted on a double logarithmic scale , a power - law appears as a straight line with negative slope @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior contrasts with a normal distribution which would curve sharply on a log - log plot , such that the probability of a node having a degree greater than a certain `` cutoff '' value is nearly zero .",
    "the mean would then trivially represent a characteristic scale for the network degree distribution .",
    "since networks with power - low degree distribution lack any such cutoff value , at least in theory , they are often called _ scale - free _",
    "networks @xcite .",
    "examples of such scale - free networks are the world - wide - web , the internet , scientific collaboration and citation networks , and biochemical networks .",
    "to model a physical energy landscape as a network , doye @xcite needed to decide first on a definition both of a state of the system and how two states were connected .",
    "the states and their connections will then provide the nodes and edges of the network . for systems with continuous degrees of freedom , the author achieved this through the ` inherent structure ' mapping @xcite . in this mapping each point in configuration space is associated with the minimum ( or ` inherent structure ' ) reached by following a steepest - descent path from that point .",
    "this mapping divides configuration into basins of attraction surrounding each minimum on the energy landscape .",
    "we use a modification of this idea for the @xmath0 family of binary landscapes , which indeed can be applied to any combinatorial landscape . in our case ,",
    "the vertexes of the graph are the local maxima of the landscape , obtained exhaustively by running a best - improvement local search algorithm ( see algorithm 1 ) from every configuration of the search space .",
    "the edges in the network connect local optima of adjacent basins of attraction .",
    "an illustration for a model 2d landscape can be seen in figure [ fig : inherentn ] , which is inspired by a similar figure appearing in @xcite . here , we illustrate a network of local maxima ( instead of local minima ) . a more formal definition of our inherent networks is given in section [ defs ] . as it was the case in the study on physical energy landscapes @xcite",
    ", we do not consider multiple edges , or weights in the edges .",
    "this may be a factor to consider in future work .",
    ", width=188 ]    , width=94 ]    note that while a physical energy landscape is formally a continuous landscape , ours are strictly combinatorial , i.e. discrete and finite .",
    "moreover , the energy landscape of a stable atomic cluster , crystal or molecule is relatively smooth and easy to search and has been called a `` funnel '' landscape  @xcite . in contrast , in @xmath0 landscapes one can continuously vary the intrinsic landscape difficulty by changing the value of @xmath7 . as a result , we shall see that @xmath0 landscapes show a number of different behaviors depending on @xmath7 for a given @xmath8 , and these different behaviors are reflected on their inherent networks .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 landscapes can be seen as analogous to those of spin - glasses  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to atomic cluster energy landscapes , spin glass landscapes may show frustration , i.e. configurations that must respect conflicting constraints , and solving for the ground state of the system that is , the minimum energy configuration is an np - hard problem .",
    "similar consequences are caused by the introduction of epistatic interactions through the increase of the @xmath7 value in @xmath0 landscapes .",
    "below we present the relevant formal definitions and algorithms to obtain our combinatorial analogous of an energy landscape inherent network .",

    "a landscape is a triplet @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a set of potential solutions i.e. a search space , @xmath11 , a neighborhood structure , is a function that assigns to every @xmath12 a set of neighbours @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a fitness function that can be pictured as the _ height _ of the corresponding potential solutions .    in our study , the search space is composed by binary strings of length @xmath8 , therefore its size is @xmath15 .",
    "the neighborhood is defined by the minimum possible move on a binary search space , that is , the 1-move or bit - flip operation . in consequence , for any given string @xmath16 of length @xmath8 , the neighborhood size is @xmath17 .",

    "no significant differences between the two models were found in @xcite in terms of global properties of the respective families of landscapes , such as mean number of local optima or autocorrelation length .",

    "this observation offers a mental picture of @xmath0 landscapes : we can consider the landscape as composed of a large number of mountains ( each corresponding to a basin of attraction ) , and those mountains are wider the taller the hilltops .",

    "there is a clear positive correlation between the degree and the basin sizes of maxima in the network .",
    "this observation suggests that landscapes with low @xmath7 values can be searched more effectively since a given configuration has many neighbors belonging to the same large basin of attraction .",
    "it is also confirmed that the basins for low @xmath7 are much larger than those for high @xmath7 , not only the basin corresponding to the global maximum .",
    "we have proposed a new characterization of combinatorial fitness landscapes using the well - known family of @xmath0 landscapes as an example .",
    "we have used an extension of the concept of inherent networks proposed for energy surfaces  @xcite in order to abstract and simplify the landscape description . in our case",
    "the inherent network is the graph where the vertices are all the local maxima and edges mean basin adjacency between two maxima .",
    "we have exhaustively obtained these graphs for @xmath186 and @xmath189 , and for all even values of @xmath7 , plus @xmath44 .",
    "the maxima graphs are small worlds since the average path lengths are short and scale logarithmically in the size of the graphs",
    ". however , the maxima graphs are not random .",
    "this is shown by their clustering coefficients , which are much larger than those of corresponding random graphs and also by their degree distribution functions , which are not poissonian but rather exponential .",
    "the construction of the maxima networks requires the determination of the basins of attraction of the corresponding landscapes .",
    "we have thus described the nature of the basins and their relationship with the local maxima network .",
    "we have found that the size of the basin corresponding to the global maximum becomes smaller with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the distribution of the basin sizes is approximately exponential for all @xmath8 and @xmath7 , but the basin sizes are larger for low @xmath7 , another indirect indication of the increasing randomness and difficulty of the landscapes when @xmath7 becomes large .",
    "finally , there is a strong positive correlation between the basin size of a maxima and their degree , which confirms that the synthetic view provided by the maxima graph is a useful one .",
    "this study represents our first attempt towards a topological and statistical characterization of easy and hard combinatorial landscapes .",
    "much remains to be done .",
    "first of all , the results found should be confirmed for larger instances of @xmath0 landscapes .",
    "this will require good sampling techniques , or theoretical studies since exhaustive sampling becomes quickly impractical .",
    "other landscape types should also be examined , such as those containing neutrality , which are very common in real - world applications .",
    "work is in progress for neutral versions of @xmath0 landscapes .",
    "finally , the landscape statistical characterization is only a step toward implementing good methods for searching it .",
    "we thus hope that our results will help in designing or estimating efficient search techniques and operators .",
