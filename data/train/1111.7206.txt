    "due to fast experimental progress @xcite , it becomes increasingly important to model quantum optical systems with spontaneous photon emission more and more accurately @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we revisit the derivation of the master equation of an atomic two - level system , like a single quantum dot , a single colour centre in diamond , or a well - localised atom or ion , within a free radiation field without employing the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and certain markovian approximations .",
    "the starting point of our derivation is , as usual , a quantum electrodynamic hamiltonian of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the atom , the field , and the atom - field interaction components .",
    "this hamiltonian acts on a hilbert space @xmath4 whose subspaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the eigenspaces of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . the purpose of the master equation is to summarise the effective time evolution of the atomic system induced by this hamiltonian and by the coupling of the field to a photon - absorbing environment .",
    "but there is a problem : there are in principle infinitely many unitarily equivalent representations @xmath7 of the hamiltonian @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "each of these hamiltonians relates to @xmath8 via a unitary transformation @xmath9 , @xmath10 now , suppose @xmath9 does not commute with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "then , although physically equivalent , @xmath8 and @xmath7 correspond to different decompositions of the hilbert space @xmath11 into subspaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 . both refer in general to physically different components as representing the  system \" and as representing the  field \" @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath8 and @xmath7 therefore result in general in different master equations .",
    "this problem only vanishes when certain markovian approximations are employed which reduce every master equation to the standard born - markov form ",
    "independent of the chosen representation of @xmath8 .",
    "when going beyond these approximations , we are faced with the question as to which representation of @xmath8 should be employed ?",
    "that there are many different representations of @xmath8 is directly related to the fact that there are many possible choices of gauge of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the most prominent form of @xmath8 is the so - called _ minimal coupling _",
    "hamiltonian which is obtained after applying the canonical quantisation procedure to the classical lagrangian in coulomb gauge @xcite .",
    "starting from this hamiltonian , a more general form of the atom - field hamiltonian , including the _ multipolar _ hamiltonian , is obtained through the application of the power - zienau - woolley ( pzw ) transformation @xcite .",
    "further representations of @xmath8 are obtained through a generalised pzw transformation which depends on a set of parameters @xmath12 .",
    "as pointed out by drummond @xcite , a particular choice of @xmath12 s can be made to eliminate the counter - rotating terms in the atom - field interaction @xmath3 , when assuming that the size of the atomic system is much smaller than a typical optical wave length ( electric dipole approximation ) . in the following we refer to the resulting hamiltonian as the _ rotating wave _ hamiltonian , since almost the same hamiltonian , ie .",
    "a hamiltonian of the same form but with different coupling constants , arises when applying the rwa .",
    "this paper considers the vast set of unitarily equivalent atom - field hamiltonians generated by the above mentioned generalisation of the pzw transformation @xcite and derives a master equation for every one of them .",
    "it is then shown that most of these equations predict enormous stationary state photon emission rates @xmath13 , even in the absence of external driving , when we consider the parameters of recent experiments with single quantum dots @xcite and single colour centers in diamond @xcite . the only master equation which yields @xmath14 is the one associated with the rotating wave hamiltonian .",
    "this means , this hamiltonian ( and not the minimal coupling or the multipolar hamiltonians ) constitutes the physically most relevant representation of the atom - field hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) . as we shall see below",
    ", the corresponding master equation is essentially the same as the standard born - markov master equation .",
    "however , it is no longer the result of approximations but the result of a specific choice of @xmath9 which identifies the bare states of the atomic system and its free radiation field correctly .",
    "many different ways of deriving master equations , ie .  of deriving an effective equation for the time evolution of the atomic system , can be found in the literature . due to a great variety of microscopic models ,",
    "different authors usually apply different approximations . for example , many derivations of master equations rely on the so - called born approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation assumes that the state of a system and its bath can be written as a product state of the form @xmath15 at any possible initial time @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the thermal equilibrium of the bath .",
    "in general it is emphasized that the born approximation applies well only in certain situations , like the weak coupling regime , where memory effects remain negligible @xcite .",
    "moreover , many authors emphasize that there is a strong overlap between the validity range of the born approximation and the validity range of certain markovian approximations .",
    "a system is markovian , ie .  without a memory , when correlations between system and environment exist only on time scales which are much shorter than the time scale on which the system evolves .",
    "it has therefore been argued that it is not possible to apply the born approximation without using in addition certain markovian approximations @xcite . when applying both approximations to atom - field systems , we obtain the standard born - markov master equation @xcite .",
    "all possible representations of @xmath8 result in the same master equation , independent of whether or not the rwa is applied to the hamiltonian . in other words ,",
    "the only way of obtaining a master equation which is more precise than already existing master equations is to allow for non - markovian descriptions ( cf .",
    ".  refs .",
    "however , although these papers contain interesting results for a variety of quantum systems , they do not apply to the system which we consider here .",
    "the reason for this is that the above observation only applies when system and bath form a closed quantum system with only unitary dynamics , as it is widely assumed in the literature @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a different point of view .",
    "following the ideas of hegerfeldt and wilser @xcite and others @xcite , we take the interaction of the free radiation field with an external environment , like a detector or the walls of the laboratory , explicitly into account . following the ideas of zurek and paz on decoherence and einselection ( see eg .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) and applying them to the free radiation field and its external environment , we assume that this environment resets the free radiation field on a coarse grained time scale @xmath18 onto its vacuum state @xmath19 .",
    "this means , the born approximation which assumes that the density matrix of the atom - field system can be written as @xmath20 is no longer an approximation but the result of external environmental couplings .",
    "hence it is well justified to derive an effective master equation for the atomic system without employing the rwa and certain markovian approximations , but still employing eq .",
    "( [ rhonew ] ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain a master equation whose constants depend on the typical environmental response time @xmath18 and which is automatically markovian .",
    "this is as expected , since the free radiation field does not constitute a memory for the states of the atomic system .",
    "the above described approach of deriving master equations for atomic systems with spontaneous photon emission is in very good agreement with actual quantum optics experiments @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown experimentally that certain three - level atoms exhibit macroscopic quantum jumps @xcite , ie .",
    "they emit a completely random telegraph signal with long intervals of intense photon emissions interrupted by periods of the complete absence of photons @xcite . in the experiment by eichmann _",
    "@xcite two laser driven two - level atoms emit photons onto a far - away screen , where they form an interference patterns which is typical for double slit experiments @xcite . in both experiments ,",
    "the free radiation field constantly leaks information about the atomic system into an external environment . when an atom emits a real photon , the photon flies away and is absorbed after a relatively short time @xmath18 .",
    "it does not return to interact again with its source .",
    "as summarised in eq .",
    "( [ rhonew ] ) , environmental couplings project the atom - field system onto a product state with the free radiation field in its vacuum state .",
    "notice however that for most representations of the atom - field system , the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) is an entangled state .",
    "this means , in most derivations of master equations , the interaction with the environment resets the atom - field system constantly onto a state which is energetically higher than its ground state . if this applies , the photon - absorbing environment constantly pumps energy into the system which then manifests itself as a non - zero stationary state photon emission rate even in the absence of external driving @xcite .",
    "such a concentration of energy might play a crucial role in sonoluminescence experiments @xcite .",
    "however , it need not play a role in atom - field systems , since the ground state of the rotating wave hamiltonian is a product state with the free radiation field in its vacuum state .",
    "some authors argue that the description of a physical system like an atom in a free radiation field should be gauge - independent ( see eg",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is no longer the case when we select for example the master equation associated with the rotating wave hamiltonian .",
    "however , notice that we consider the atom - field system as an open quantum system with a photon - absorbing environment .",
    "this environment makes a concrete choice as to which component of the atom - field system represents the  field `` and which one represents the ' ' atom . \"",
    "a similar choice should be made when deriving an atomic master equation .",
    "there are five sections in this paper . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we introduce a large class of unitarily equivalent representations of the atom - field hamiltonian . in section [ section3 ]",
    ", we obtain a large set of non - equivalent master equations . in section [ section4 ] , we calculate the corresponding stationary state photon emission rate . the results of this calculation help us to select what we believe to be the most accurate master equation .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on a large set of unitarily equivalent atom - field hamiltonians which we obtain by applying a wide range of unitary transformations @xmath9 to the _ minimal coupling _ hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the power - zienau - woolley ( pzw ) transformation transforms this hamiltonian into the so - called _ multipolar _ hamiltonian @xcite . in general",
    ", we obtain a hamiltonian which is a mixture of the minimal coupling and the multipolar hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the most notable of these hamiltonians is the one that does not contain any counter rotating terms in the atom - field interaction @xcite .",
    "since this hamiltonian is of the same form as the hamiltonian @xmath8 of the atom - field system obtained when applying the rwa , we refer to it in the following as the _ rotating wave _ hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian is now no longer the result of approximations but the result of a certain unitary transformation @xmath9 .      to begin with we consider an electron of charge @xmath21 and mass @xmath22 which is trapped inside a potential @xmath23 and that couples to a continuum of quantised electromagnetic field modes .",

    "instead , we take the coupling of the free radiation field to an additional external environment , like a detector or the walls of the laboratory , explicitly into account .",
    "this external environment thermalises very rapidly and is in general in an equilibrium state .",

    "this applies when the vacuum state @xmath19 is an einselected state of the free radiation field .",

    "environmentally - selected ) states are states which remain stable in spite of the environment @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the free radiation field possesses only a single einselected state .",
    "this is justified on the grounds that emitted photons fly away from the atom and are absorbed . in the absence of an atomic emitter but in the presence of a photon - absorbing environment , the vacuum state @xmath19 is the only state of the free radiation field which does not evolve in time .",
    "the above considerations allow us to write the density matrix @xmath99 of the atom - field system at any time @xmath16 as @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes an atomic density matrix with respect to the above introduced interaction picture .",
