    "the long - range asymptotic form of the indexed potentials for exchange and correlation is electrostatic , modified by polarization response .",
    "the significant success of dft and of model theories suggests that , not far outside a source charge density , the asymptotic potentials in general reduce to nonindexed collective fields .",
    "if this is valid , it would justify a `` local nonlocal '' ( lnl ) model , in which true indexed potentials are used only within local cells , while asymptotic forms of the extracellular fields are combined as an effective mean field in each such cell . as in the ewald expansion",

    "this may justify neglecting the multipole part of the effective field in each cell during self - consistent iterations , including it as a first - order perturbation after convergence .",

    "these matrix elements @xmath96 agree with the leading self - energy diagrams in many - body perturbation theory .",
    "this determines the kernel of the linear operator @xmath37 .    as an illustrative example , this formula has been simplified and applied to the leading long - range term in an iterative expansion of the multipole polarization potential implied by bound - free correlation between a scattered electron and a polarizable target@xcite .",
    "this analysis introduces a polarization pseudostate @xmath97 , computed as the normalized first - order response of an occupied orbital @xmath98 of the target system to an external multipole field . for multipole index @xmath99 ,",
    "transition matrix elements @xmath100 vary as @xmath101 for small r and as @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "the implied multipole polarization potential is quadratic in these transition elements and varies as @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , in these limits .",

    "when applied for @xmath107 to variational calculations of low - energy e - he scattering , this polarization potential produced scattering phase shifts in good agreement with earlier variational calculations that incorporated dipole polarization response .",

    "it is a call to the condensed - matter community to move beyond dft by extending current methodology for nonlocal potentials .",
