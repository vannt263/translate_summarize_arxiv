    "eisenhart ( 1939 ) offered the first solution to the calibration problem , and is commonly known as the @xmath20 estimator to the linear calibration problem .",
    "they assumed that the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath22 was of a simple linear form : @xmath23 the estimated regression line for the first stage of the experiment is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the least squares estimate of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .  using the data collected at the first stage of experimentation , eisenhart ( 1939 ) inverts equation ( [ eq : simple ] ) to estimate the unknown regressor value @xmath17 for an observed response value @xmath16 , by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the @xmath20 estimator for @xmath17 .",
