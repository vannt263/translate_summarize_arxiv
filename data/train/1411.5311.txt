    "high mobility two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) show extraordinary physical properties such as the integral- and fractional- quantum hall effects at low temperatures and low filling factors , where the diagonal resistance vanishes as the hall resistance exhibits quantized hall plateaus .",
    "more recently , it has been demonstrated that such high mobility 2des can also exhibit zero - resistance states at very large filling factors or small magnetic fields when the 2des material is photo - excited by microwave or terahertz radiation .",
    "such microwave radiation - induced zero resistance states ( mrizrs),@xcite arise from large amplitude @xmath0-periodic microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations ( mrimos)@xcite . although the observations reported thus far have helped to stimulate much theory for associated steady - state non - equilibrium transport in low dimensional electronic systems , there remain unsettled experimental issues that require resolution in order to further the understanding of transport in the 2des under microwave excitation .    after nearly a decade of study ,",
    "the issue of the phase of the mrimos has apparently been settled in favor of the `` 1/4-cycle - shifted '' oscillations@xcite where the oscillatory minima occur about @xmath1b_f$ ] , i.e. , for the @xmath2 condition instead of for the @xmath3 condition@xcite .",
    "here @xmath4 , @xmath5 is microwave frequency , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is effective mass of electron in gaas , @xmath8 is electron charge , @xmath9 is the cyclotron angular frequency , and @xmath10 .",
    "however , there still remain two issues that remain unsettled : the power dependence of the amplitude of the microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations and the linear polarization sensitivity of these same oscillations .",
    "the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite status of these aspects are as follows : for the power dependence , some experimental results@xcite have indicated that mrimos amplitude increase non - linearly with the microwave power , as the radiation driven electron orbit model@xcite has theoretically confirmed a non - linear power relation . in contrast , the inelastic model@xcite suggests that the amplitude of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations should increase linearly with the microwave power , as suggested in early experimental work [ @xcite .",
    "so far as the microwave polarization dependence is concerned , one set of experiments@xcite suggests that mrimos are independent to the polarization orientation for both linearly and circularly polarized microwaves , while another set of experiments@xcite shows mrimo - amplitudes do depend on the polarization angle of linear polarized microwave and that it follows a cosine square function rule .",
    "theoretically , both a displacement model@xcite and the radiation driven electron orbital model@xcite confirm the dependence of mrimos on the polarization angle of linear polarized microwaves .",
    "additionally , a displacement model@xcite also indicated the dependence of the oscillatory magnetoresistance on circular- and linear- polarization .",
    "however , the inelastic model@xcite has strongly supported the idea that mrimos are insensitive to the polarization for both linearly- and circularly- polarized microwaves .",
    "to further examine the power- and linear polarization angle- dependence , we have carried out a combined study of microwave power- and linear polarization rotation angle- dependence of the amplitude of the mrimos . for such experiments , hall bars with gold - germanium alloyed contacts were fabricated on high mobility gaas / algaas heterojunctions by optical lithography .",
    "the specimens were mounted at the end of a long cylindrical waveguide , with the device - normal oriented along the waveguide axis .",
    "the waveguide sample holder was then inserted into a variable temperature insert , inside the bore of a superconducting solenoid .",
    "a base temperature of approximately 1.5 k was realized by pumping on the liquid helium within the variable temperature insert .",
    "the specimens were briefly illuminated by a red led light at low temperature to realize the high mobility condition .",
    "finally , a low frequency four terminal lock - in technique was adopted to measure the magnetoresistance .",
    "a commercially available microwave synthesizer provided the microwave excitation and the microwave power at the source was changed at 1 dbm increments for the power dependence measurements .",
    "the linear polarization angle , which is defined as the angle between the long axis of the hall bar and the microwave antenna in the microwave launcher , see figure 2(a ) , was changed by rotating the microwave launcher outside the cryostat .",
    "the results to be reported here are characteristic of the power- and polarization - angle - dependence over the range @xmath11 ghz .",
    "however , we focus here on the results at just one frequency , 33.62 ghz , since so many plots need to be exhibited to establish the overall behavior even at one frequency .    a magnetic field sweep was performed with 33.62 ghz microwave illumination , see figure 1(a ) , to obtain the photo - excited diagonal magnetoresistance , @xmath12 , following a field sweep to obtain the dark @xmath12 curve .",
    "the photo - excited blue @xmath12 curve shows pronounced radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations on both sides of magnetic field axis . since the peaks labeled p1- and p1 + , and the valleys labeled v1- and v1 + deviate the most from the dark curve",
    ", we shall examine the power dependence- and polarization dependence- at the associated four fixed values of the magnetic field .",
    "figure 1 ( b ) to ( e ) exhibit the extremal oscillatory diagonal magnetoresistance @xmath12 as a function of the microwave power , in units of mw , for p1- , v1- , v1 + and p1 + , respectively . since figure 1(b ) and",
    "1(e ) exhibit the power - dependence at the peaks of the oscillatory resistance , the @xmath12 increases as the power increases .",
    "correspondingly , since fig .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) show the power - dependence at the valleys of the oscillatory resistance , the @xmath12 becomes smaller as the power increases .",
    "note that neither the increase of @xmath12 with @xmath13 in fig .",
    "1(b ) and 1(e ) , nor the decrease of @xmath12 with @xmath13 in fig .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) is linear with respect to the microwave power .",
    "instead , they appear to follow a power function : @xmath14 , where a , c and @xmath15 are parameters . a fit of the @xmath12 vs @xmath13 traces indicated that the @xmath15 values for the different curves are all @xmath16 0.5 ( @xmath170.1 ) , which is in agreement with the results reported in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "such measurements of @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 at the magnetic fields corresponding to p1- , v1- , v1 + , and p1 + were carried out at a number of linear polarization angles over the range @xmath18 at @xmath19 increments .",
    "figure 2 summarizes the extracted angular dependence at a fixed power , @xmath13= 0.63 mw . here ,",
    "2(a ) sketches the convention for reporting the linear polarization angle , while fig .",
    "2(b ) - fig .",
    "2(e ) show @xmath12 vs. @xmath20 for p1- , v1- , v1 + , and p1 + , respectively . from fig .",
    "2(b ) -2(e ) , it is clear that all @xmath12 vs. @xmath20 traces vary sinusoidally with @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , the data curves follow the fit function@xcite @xmath21 shown in red in the figures .",
    "the fit results confirmed that the data of fig .",
    "2(b ) - 2(e ) all showed a period of @xmath22 , as expected .",
    "further , the phase shift @xmath23 = @xmath24 in fig .",
    "2(b ) , @xmath23 = @xmath25 in fig .",
    "2(c ) , @xmath23 = @xmath26 in fig .",
    "2(d ) , and @xmath23 = @xmath27 in fig .",
    "these extracted phase shifts indicate a non - trivial phase shift under field reversal , i.e. , the phase changes by @xmath28 from p1- to p1 + , and @xmath29 from v1- to v1 + .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath12 vs @xmath13 obtained for different polarization angles at p1-(fig .",
    "3 ( a ) ) , v1- ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , v1 + ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) , and p1 + ( fig .",
    "3(d ) ) . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "each of these plots shows only a few representative polarization angles in the range @xmath30 .",
    "although a non - linearity in the @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 curves is apparent for all the curves , the change in @xmath12 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 mw is not the same at all polarization angles .",
    "a close examination suggests , however , that all the curves in a given panel follow the same power function law .",
    "therefore , we utilize a power scaling factor @xmath33 to normalize the different polarization angle curves in a given panel ( fig .",
    "3(a)-(d ) ) to the same curve . as figure 3 ( e ) to ( h )",
    "show , all the curves on the left column of fig .",
    "3 can be normalized to the same curve on the right column by using a polarization angle dependent power scaling factor , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "these power scaling factors depend upon both the magnetic field and polarization angles .",
    "we have found that the power scaling factor follows a certain rule as the polarization angle change , see fig .",
    "4 .    in figure 4 ,",
    "the inverted power scaling factor @xmath35 is plotted versus the polarization angle @xmath20 for p1- ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , v1- ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) , v1 + ( fig . 4(c ) ) , and p1 + ( fig .",
    "4 ( d ) ) . fig .",
    "4 shows that the @xmath35 varies sinusoidally with the polarization angle @xmath20 , and follows the fit function @xmath36 , which is shown in red in the figures . the main difference between these fits and the fits shown in fig .",
    "2 is that , here , both the peaks and the valleys in the oscillatory magnetoresistance show a `` + '' sign between the constant ( a ) and the @xmath37 terms , while for the data of fig .",
    "2 , the `` + '' sign appears for oscillatory magnetoresistance maxima , while the `` - '' term appears for the oscillatory magnetoresistance minima . as the fig .",
    "4(a ) to ( d ) show , the polarization phase shift angle @xmath23 is less than @xmath19 and comparable to the values reported in fig .",
    "2 . for instance , @xmath38 observed in the @xmath39 vs. @xmath20 plot is @xmath40 in fig .",
    "4(a ) and that observed in the @xmath41 vs. @xmath20 plot is @xmath42 in fig .",
    "the experimental uncertainty in associated polarization angle measurements is @xmath19 .",
    "from the above results , it is possible to draw three conclusions : ( a ) the magnetoresistance @xmath12 is a non - linear function of the microwave power @xmath13 , see fig . 1 and fig .",
    "( b ) the peak- or valley- magnetoresistance is a cosine square function of linear microwave polarization angle @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 , see fig .",
    "although the @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 traces at different polarization angles for a given extremum look dissimilar at first sight , see fig .",
    "3(a)-(d ) , they are really just manifestations of the same trace because the @xmath12 vs @xmath13 curves for different polarization angles can be normalized by dividing with a power scaling factor @xmath33 , see fig .",
    "3(e ) - ( h ) .",
    "remarkably , this scaling factor also follows a cosine square function of linear microwave polarization angle , see fig .",
    "4 . note that , although we have only exhibited the results for @xmath5= 33.62 ghz , the same features were observed at other frequencies in the range @xmath43 ghz .",
    "the first two points show the relative success of the displacement model and the radiation driven electron orbital model in describing the power - dependence and polarization - dependence of the microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "the displacement model@xcite suggests that microwave photo - excited electrons are scattered by impurities , and this gives rise to an additional current density due to radiation .",
    "the magnitude of this photo - excited current density is a function of the polarization angle .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is no clear prediction regarding how , quantitatively , the microwave power at different polarization angles influences the photo - excited current density .",
    "the radiation driven electron orbital model@xcite describes a periodic back- and forth- radiation driven motion of the electron orbits and the conductivity modulation resulting from the average coordinate change ( scattering jump ) .",
    "this model shows both a non - linear power dependence and a linear polarization angle dependence , similar to experiment . on the other hand , the inelastic model for magnetooscillations in the photoconductivity of the 2des@xcite ,",
    "is governed by the microwave - induced change in the distribution function . here , steady state microwave photoexcitation produces a change in the distribution function with oscillatory components that lead to oscillatory variations in the photoconductivity , which are linear in the microwave power and independent of the linear microwave polarization .    finally ,",
    "regarding point ( c ) , the point that the @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 curves at different polarization angles @xmath20 are really just manifestations of the same curve can be understood as follows : in our experiment , the transverse electric ( te ) mode is excited by the mw antenna of figure 2(a ) , and the specimen is subject to the te@xmath44 mode of the circular waveguide .",
    "the electric field along the device axis or the effective electric field @xmath45 , see fig .",
    "2(a ) , is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is applied ac electric field .",
    "since the measurements are reported as a function of the microwave power , which is the experimental variable , one might define an effective power , @xmath48 .",
    "then , @xmath49 gives the relation between the effective and applied microwave power and the polarization angle .",
    "the results , see fig .",
    "3 , show that @xmath50 normalizes microwave power with different polarization angles to the same effective power scale , making @xmath12 vs @xmath50 curves overlap each other on the right column of figure 3 .",
    "further , figure 4 shows that @xmath51 vs. @xmath20 can be fit @xmath52 .",
    "this confirms the role of a device parallel electric field .",
    "4 also indicates that the phase shifts of this power scaling factor deviates at most by small angles from @xmath40 , which suggests that the zero polarization angle yields the maximum effective power .",
    "microwave power dependence and linear polarization dependence studies of the radiation - induced oscillatory magnetoresistance in high quality gaas / algaas 2des indicate a non - linear variation in the amplitude of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations with the microwave power at the oscillatory extrema along with a cosine squared dependence on the polarization angle .",
    "furthermore , an empirically defined power scaling factor for normalizing the @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 traces obtained at different linear microwave polarization angles also follows the cosine square function .",
    "this latter feature suggests that the device parallel component of electric field influences photo - excited electron transport .",
    "however , because the phase shifts @xmath23 are different at different magnetic fields , there are most likely other factors other than the cosine component of electric field that also play a role in the observed response .",
