    "the molecular mobility of dissolved substances increases considerably in solution .",
    "not only the flow properties can be controlled easily in solution , but also the phase behavior ( and hence the morphology ) of the dissolved materials , e.g. , by changing the thermodynamic state conditions like temperature , pressure , and concentration .",
    "a particularly important solvent is supercritical carbon dioxide , because the material is inexpensive , nonpoisonous , not reactive , and thermally stable .",
    "hence , its application as a solvent is widespread .",
    "@xcite however , the phase behavior of polymer - solvent systems or other binary fluid mixtures is rather complex in general .",
    "when the thermodynamic control parameters temperature @xmath3 , pressure @xmath4 and solute molar fraction @xmath5 are varied , various liquid - vapor and fluid - fluid phase equilibria occur , and many different types of ( rather complicated ) phase diagrams can be observed @xcite . even for simple binary fluid mixtures , e.g. , carbon dioxide plus short alkanes such as hexadecane , the phase diagram is only known rather incompletely from experiment .",
    "@xcite these uncertainties also hamper the judgment of the accuracy of the theoretical modeling of such systems .",
    "@xcite in fact , due to the large control parameter - space that needs to be explored , comprehensive experimental work would be very cumbersome , and a modeling approach seems to be the method of choice .",
    "however , the large number of states @xmath6 that need to be simulated and the complexity of the systems renders a fully chemically realistic all - atom simulation practically impossible .",
    "thus , the construction of a suitable coarse - grained model for such systems containing polymers ( or oligomers , respectively ) is very desirable .",
    "while there is a rich literature on the construction of coarse - grained models for ( flexible ) polymers , @xcite comparatively little attention has been paid to the question on how a coarse - grained solvent molecule such as co@xmath7 should be described .",
    "iwai et al .",
    "@xcite and virnau et al .",
    "@xcite simply used particles interacting with simple lennard - jones forces among themselves and with the beads of the bead - spring chain that represents effective subunits of the polymer . while particles interacting with lennard - jones potentials describe noble gases such as liquid argon or neon rather well , it is clear that a `` lennard - jonesium '' is a somewhat unsatisfactory description of a carbon dioxide molecule . while considerable attention has been paid to atomistic models of co@xmath7 , @xcite we are not aware of comprehensive systematic studies of coarse - grained models for this molecular fluid . with respect to the atomistic models for co@xmath7",
    ", we note that there is no consensus in the literature on a unique form of the interaction potential and its parameters .",
    "starting from the murthy - singer - mcdonald ( msm ) model , @xcite several potentials have been proposed ( for a recent comparison see ref .  ) . in ref .  , two variants of the elementary physical model ( epm ) force field were suggested , that yielded critical temperatures of @xmath8 k and @xmath9 k , respectively , while the experimental value is @xmath10 k. @xcite in view of this 3% discrepancy between the atomistic models and the experiment , it was suggested @xcite to use the experimental critical temperature and rescale the energy parameters of the model to reproduce the correct value of the critical temperature ( epm2 ) .",
    "in fact , virnau et al .",
    "@xcite , using a simple `` lennard - jonesium '' to model co@xmath7 , fixed the lennard - jones parameters to match both the critical temperature @xmath11 and the critical density @xmath12 .",
    "since the atomistic models underestimate the critical density ( yielding @xcite @xmath13 kg@xmath14m@xmath15 or @xmath16 kg@xmath14m@xmath15 instead of the experimental value @xcite @xmath17 kg@xmath14m@xmath15 ) , they also require a corresponding rescaling of the interaction range parameters .",
    "hence , epm2 needs the same input from the experimental critical data as the coarse - grained model of virnau et al .",
    "@xcite . for the resulting model , the coexistence densities predicted for the liquid branch in the temperature region @xmath18k @xmath19k deviate distinctly less from the experimental results @xcite than the corresponding results of the coarse - grained model .",
    "@xcite    as indicated above , the main interest for obtaining an accurate coarse - grained model for co@xmath7 is its potential application in multicomponent systems , e.g. , polymer solutions in which co@xmath7 acts as a solvent .",
    "@xcite for such systems also many attempts were undertaken to derive approximate analytical equations of states ( e.g. , refs .  ) and it is , of course , also highly desirable to validate such equation of state theories by simulations .",
    "however , the coarse - grained model for co@xmath7 of virnau et al.@xcite , when combined with a suitable coarse - grained model for the alkanes , required rather large deviations from the simple lorentz - berthelot mixing rules to account for the available experimental data",
    ". @xcite most likely , the somewhat oversimplified co@xmath7 model is responsible for most of these deviations .",
    "approximating co@xmath7 as a lennard - jones particle without considering its rather large quadrupolar moment ( @xmath20 d@xmath21 ) is probably not sufficient  the unit d ( debye ) equals @xmath22 in cgs units which are adopted throughout the manuscript .    in the present paper",
    "we explore a slightly more involved coarse - grained model for co@xmath7.@xcite the molecule is still described as a lennard - jones particle , but we also include the experimentally known quadrupole moment as an input parameter , together with critical temperature and critical density . a precondition for the usefulness of coarse - grained models",
    "is that simulation codes execute very fast .",
    "the angular - dependent quadrupole - quadrupole interaction requires significant computational resources which would be a serious drawback to such a model .",
    "however , compared to the lennard - jones forces , the quadrupolar interaction is still a rather weak perturbation .",
    "therefore , we apply one further approximation : @xcite the angular dependence is averaged over in a second order thermodynamic perturbation calculation .",
    "thus , an effective isotropic potential is obtained .",
    "rather encouraging results using such an approximation have been reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite mller and gelb @xcite estimate coexistence curves from non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulations of temperature quenches from the one - phase region into the two - phase region , where one then waits until the system has phase separated into the two coexisting phases .",
    "@xcite in this manuscript we apply grand - canonical monte carlo methods , @xcite combined with a finite size scaling @xcite analysis .",
    "this allows us to locate precisely the critical point of the model .",
    "note that a direct estimation of the critical point from the simulation is difficult if either gibbs ensemble techniques @xcite or the temperature quench technique @xcite are applied . in these cases ,",
    "one relies on a fit of the coexistence data to a suitable power law extrapolation . with the present techniques one can obtain the critical properties very accurately",

    "it is clear that @xmath45 is explicitly temperature - dependent because @xmath48 and @xmath43 are temperature - dependent .",

    "our choice of a rather small value for the cutoff is mainly motivated by the desire to have a very fast simulation algorithm , but larger cutoffs will lead to very similar results . as we will demonstrate later , differences in the phase diagram almost disappear when simulation data are rescaled to match the experimental critical point for different @xmath51 .",
    "a further motivation for this choice of the cutoff is that for @xmath52 our model reduces to that of refs .  .",

( [ eq5 ] ) ) is a rather incomplete description for the interactions between elongated co@xmath7 molecules . in principle , the systematic coarse - graining of a chemically realistic model could lead to some effective value for @xmath23 , which is larger than the experimental one .",

    "complicated atomistic models also lead to rather slow simulation programs ( partial charges require to deal with rather long range coulombic interactions , etc . ) .",
    "while such models may still be manageable for the simulation of pure fluids , their drawbacks become clearly apparent when the approach is extended to binary or ternary fluids . in mixtures ,",
    "a large control parameter space needs to be explored and several phase separations may compete with each other , leading to very involved phase diagrams .",
