    "ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions are used to study the quantum chromodynamics in the extreme conditions of high temperature and high energy density@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0s have a very short life time ( @xmath6 ) which is comparable to the expected life time of the fireball created in heavy ion collisions@xcite . in the dense medium created ,",
    "resonances are produced in close proximity with other strongly interacting hadrons , and hence the in - medium effects related to the high density / or high temperature of the medium can modify the characteristic properties such as masses , widths , and spectra shapes .",
    "therefore , studies of resonance production mechanism can be a useful tool in understanding the properties of the high density matter@xcite@xcite .    due to the short life time , some of the @xmath7s produced at hadronization can decay in the medium before the kinetic freezeout , and are less likely to be reconstructed due to the rescattering of the daughter particles .",
    "alternatively the interaction between the large population of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , may regenerate @xmath7 increasing the observed yield@xcite .",
    "these two competing processes determine the final @xmath0 yield which depends on the time elapsed between the chemical and kinetic freeze - out , the source size and the interaction cross section of daughter hadrons .",
    "since the @xmath10 total interaction cross section@xcite is significantly larger ( about a factor @xmath11 ) than the @xmath12 total interaction cross - section@xcite , the final observable @xmath7 yield in heavy ion collisions at rhic is expected to be smaller than the primordial yield .",
    "this should be evident in a suppression of the @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 yield ratios in aa compared to elementary pp collisions at similar collision energy .",
    "comparison of those ratios can then be used to roughly estimate the lower limit on the time difference between chemical freeze - out and kinetic freeze - out@xcite .",
    "centrality dependence of this suppression can be used to gauge the size of the fireball .",
    "the system size and energy dependence studies can shed additional light on the different in - medium effects , particularly the interplay between regeneration and rescattering mechanisms .",
    "the primary tracking device , tpc(time projection chamber ) within star was used to measure the @xmath7 production via its hadronic decay channel .",
    "tpc provides the particle identification and the momentum information of the charged particles by measuring their ionisation energy loss(de",
    "/ dx)@xcite .",
    "the results discussed here are taken from au+au at @xmath3= 62.4 gev and cu+cu collisions at @xmath3= 200 gev and @xmath3= 62.4 gev at rhic .",
    "charged kaons and pions were selected from the primary tracks whose distance of closest approach to the primary vertex have values less than 1.5 cm .",
    "the kaons and pions were selected requiring the de / dx to be within two standard deviations(2@xmath15 ) from the bethe - bloch expectation for energy loss .",
    "both the kaons and pions were required to have atleast 15 fit points for the tracks reconstructed inside the tpc and the ratio of the number of fit points to the number of maximum possible fit points was greater than 0.55 to avoid selecting split tracks .",
    "further kaon and pion tracks were selected with both momentum and @xmath2 greater than 0.2 gev / c .",
    "the unlike - sign k@xmath8 invariant mass distribution was reconstructed from random combination of pairs from an event .",
    "the combinatorial background distribution was built by using mixed - event technique where the unlike - sign k@xmath8 invariant mass was obtained from different events@xcite .",
    "the data sample was divided into 10 bins in multiplicity and @xmath16 position .",
    "the pairs from events in same multiplicity and vertex position bins were selected for mixing to ensure that the event characteristic remain similar between different events . the mixed event generated was normalized to subtract the background in the same event unlike - sign invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the normalisation factor was evaluated by taking the ratio between the number of entries in the unlike - sign same event and mixed event distributions for invariant mass greater than 1.1 gev / c as k@xmath8 pairs with invariant mass greater than 1.1 gev are less likely to be correlated . after subtracting the normalized mixed event background from the unlike sign spectrum , we observe the @xmath0 signal . in the unlike sign spectrum",
    "we also have higher and/or lower k@xmath8 mass resonant states and nonresonant correlations due to particle misidentification which contribute significantly to the residual correlations near the signal .",
    "these attributes are not present in the mixed event spectrum and thus the mixed event only removes the uncorrelated background pairs from the unlike sign spectrum .",
    "figure [ signal ] shows the unlike sign k@xmath8 invariant mass spectrum after normalized mixed event background subtraction in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath3= 62.4 gev .",
    "the invariant mass distribution is fitted to the function sbw + rbw where sbw is the non relativistic breit wigner function and rbg is the linear function describing the residual background@xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath17 mass and width with respect to @xmath2 for minimum bias au+au and cu+cu collisions is shown in figure [ masswidth ] . within the errors , we do not observe a large difference in the measured @xmath17 mass from the pdg@xcite value for most of the @xmath2 range studied .",
    "the @xmath17 width measured is comparable to the pdg value.the systematic uncertainities in the mass and width were calculated by varying the particle types , background subtraction functions and the dynamical cuts .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows the @xmath0 mid - rapidity transverse momentum spectra for different centralities of au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath3= 62.4 gev .",
    "the raw spectra yields , corrected for efficiency and detector acceptance are well described by exponential fit function .",
    "the @xmath17 yield at midrapidity is calculated from the data points in the measured range and exponential fit was used to extract the yield outside the fiducial range .",
    "the @xmath17 invariant yield increases with number of participants in both au+au and cu+cu collisions .",
    "the systematic uncertainities on @xmath17 dn / dy is estimated by using different fit functions , particle types and dynamical cuts .",
    "the variation of measured @xmath0 dn / dy with respect to number of participants is depicted in figure [ meanptdndy ] .",
    "the @xmath17 mean @xmath2 was evaluated using the data points in the measured range of the @xmath2 spectrum while assuming an exponential behaviour outside the fiducial range .",
    "the systematic uncertainity includes the differences between the direct calculation and from all other sources mentioned earlier .",
    "the @xmath17 mean @xmath2 as a function of number of participants is shown in figure [ meanptdndy ] ( right panel ) for all the collision systems discussed .",
    "no significant centrality and system size dependence of mean @xmath2 is observed for @xmath17 in au+au and cu+cu collisions at a given colliding energy .",
    "the measurement of @xmath18 yield ratio can provide vital information on the @xmath0 production properties as @xmath17 and @xmath19 have different masses and spin but identical quark content .",
    "this ratio was observed to be smaller in au+au collisions compared to p+p collisons at the same beam energy @xcite .",
    "figure [ particleratio](left panel ) shows that @xmath18 ratio decreases with number of participants in au+au collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev .",
    "this may indicate that the rescattering effect is dominant over the regeneration effect and the fireball created in central collisions has comparatively larger lifetime than the peripheral collisions .",
    "similarly @xmath20 ratio may also give us an idea on rescattering and regeneration effect as both @xmath21 amd @xmath17 have same spin and similar mass but different strangeness number and lifetime .",
    "in figure [ particleratio](right panel ) , we observe that @xmath20 ratio increases with number of participants in au+au collisons at 62.4 and 200 gev favouring the dominance of rescattering effect",
    ". since @xmath21 and @xmath17 have different strangeness number , the observed increase may be due to the possible strangeness enhancement in more central collisons .",
    "the preliminary results on the @xmath0 production in au+au and cu+cu collisions measured with the star detector at rhic at @xmath3 = 62.4 gev and @xmath3 = 200 gev are presented .",
    "the @xmath0 integrated yield increases with number of participants in both au+au and cu+cu collision systems .",
    "no significant dependence of mean @xmath2 on system size is observed .",
    "the particle ratio measurement highlights the dominance of rescattering effect over the regeneration mechanism in @xmath0 production in heavy ion collisions .",
