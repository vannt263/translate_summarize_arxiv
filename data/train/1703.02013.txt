    "due to its structural simplicity , fese has played a leading role in many experimental and theoretical studies on fe - based superconductors since its discovery in 2008  @xcite .",
    "the enduring interest in this compound is partially owed to the high @xmath0 ( ranging between @xmath3 ) achieved when monolayer fese films are grown on srtio@xmath4 substrates  @xcite ( fese / sto ) , a ten - fold enhancement from the @xmath5 of bulk fese crystals at ambient pressure  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the high @xmath0 in the interfacial system proves to be robust for various oxide substrates , including srtio@xmath4 ( 001 )  @xcite , batio@xmath4 ( 001 )  @xcite , srtio@xmath4 ( 110 )  @xcite , anatase tio@xmath6 ( 001 )  @xcite , and rutile tio@xmath6 ( 100 )  @xcite .",
    "these oxide substrates , terminated at tio@xmath6 surface when interfaced with fese , have lattice parameters significantly larger than that of bulk fese and thus apply strong tensile strain on fese thin films .",
    "the anatase and rutile tio@xmath6 substrates even induce rather different strains along @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes of the monolayer fese .",
    "the @xmath0 s , however , are consistently above @xmath9 , as measured by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "this observation appears to rule out a direct correlation between the enhanced superconductivity and the tensile strain  @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of the interfaces displaying enhanced @xmath0 s are also remarkably similar across the various substrates .",
    "for instance , the fermi surface measured by arpes consists of only electron pockets at the corners of the two - fe brillouin zone , indicating substantial electron doping from the parent compound .",
    "this observation poses a challenge to theories for the high @xmath0 based on the pairing mediated by spin fluctuations that are strongly enhanced by fermi surface nesting .",
    "one potential solution to this problem is the involvement of bands below the fermi level in pairing ( so - called incipient band pairing )  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the involvement of a different type of pairing mediator such as nematic fluctuations  @xcite or phonons particular to the interface  @xcite .",
    "evidence for the latter has been provided by the common observation of replica bands in the electronic structure of superconducting fese monolayers on srtio@xmath4 @xcite , batio@xmath4  @xcite , and rutile tio@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the replica bands observed by arpes are exact copies of the original bands crossing the fermi level in momentum space but with a weaker spectral weight .",
    "they are interpreted as being generated by an electron - phonon ( @xmath1-ph ) interaction between the fese electrons and oxygen phonons in the substrate @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the @xmath10 energy offset between the primary and the replica band coincides with the phonon energy of oxygen modes in srtio@xmath4  @xcite , batio@xmath4  @xcite , and tio@xmath6  @xcite . due to the particular properties of the interface  @xcite ,",
    "this interaction is strongly peaked for forward scattering ( i.e. , peaked at small momentum @xmath11 transfer ) , as found by analyzing the electrostatic potential from the dipole induced by the oxygen modes  @xcite and by first - principles calculations  @xcite .",
    "this unique momentum structure accounts for the fact that the replicas sharply trace the dispersion of the primary band , which requires the @xmath1-ph interactions be forward - focused .",
    "such a coupling can also significantly enhance @xmath0 , due to the linear dependence of @xmath0 on the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath12  @xcite , as opposed to the exponential dependence obtained for the usual bcs case .",
    "for example , assuming a narrow width @xmath13 for the forward scattering peak , some of the current authors found @xmath14 reproduces the measured spectral weight ratio between the replica band and the primary band and at the same time a @xmath15  @xcite . ref .",
    "has obtained similar results after extending this approach to a more realistic band structure .",
    "many aspects of the influence of the @xmath1-ph interactions with strong forward scattering on electronic properties and superconductivity are summarized in refs .  .",
    "in comparison , there are no qualitative or quantitative studies of the phononic properties for the problem at hand . here , we have carried out such a study to address two issues .",
    "first , zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently measured the phonon linewidth of a @xmath16 phonon mode penetrating from the srtio@xmath4 substrate into thin fese films using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels ) and concluded a mode - specific @xmath1-ph coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "not only does this echo the discovery of replica bands by the arpes experiments in the same system , but it also calls for a theoretical consideration on the hreels measurements .",
    "doing so would corroborate both the total coupling strength and momentum dependence of the @xmath1-ph coupling in fese / sto system with those inferred from the arpes measurements .",
    "second , when a strong @xmath1-ph coupling is distributed over a subset of wave vectors , one expects tendencies towards charge - density - wave formation that can compete with superconductivity .",
    "such tendencies will manifest themselves as kohn anomalies in the phonon dispersion and broad phonon linewidths .",
    "one can , therefore , address this issue directly by examining the phononic self - energy .",
    "here , we examine the phonon linewidth due to @xmath1-ph interactions with strong forward scattering using the same model adopted in ref .   to study the electronic spectral function .",
    "we first describe the details of the model and method in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] we give some analytical results for the normal state phonon properties in the _ perfect _ forward scattering limit , where the interaction is treated as a delta function at @xmath18 .",
    "our numerical results for both normal and superconducting state with finite @xmath13 are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] . here ,",
    "our results show that the forward focused peak in the @xmath1-ph coupling results in very broad phonon lineshapes . however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : screened_linewidth ] we reintroduce coulomb screening , which subsequently undresses the phonon propagator and suppresses these effects . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our results and make some concluding remarks in relation to the hreels experiment of zhang _",

    "since we have a single band model , it only takes a trivial @xmath40 shift to map our @xmath34-point pocket onto the electron pocket in the real system centered at the @xmath39 point and any physical quantities depending only on the momentum transfer @xmath41 , such as phonon linewidth , do not depend on the position of the pocket .",
    "since we are not considering the effects of an unconventional pairing mechanism here , we do not need to consider the possibility of @xmath42-wave instabilities due to scattering between the electron pockets .",
    "as such , a single band model is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "throughout we approximate the experimental phonon dispersion with a dispersionless einstein mode @xmath43 according to the observed energy separation between the replica band and the primary band  @xcite , as well as the phonon dispersion of the interface , as measured by hreels  @xcite .",

    "sec : screened_linewidth ] , we show that such a treatment is justified in calculating the electron self - energy using the `` unscreened '' phonon propagator _ and _ the `` unscreened '' coupling @xmath52 , but it overestimates the phonon self - energy , especially the imaginary part ( phonon linewidth ) at @xmath53 , by overlooking the strong screening effect at @xmath53 from the fese film . the difference between the fully screened phonon frequency @xmath54 ( by both the substrate and the fese film ) and partially screened @xmath28 ( only by the substrate itself ) is small , however , so we do not distinguish them ( @xmath55 ) in sections [ sec : model ] , [ sec : analytical ] , and [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "these approaches are beyond the scope of this work , which instead focuses on a momentum dependent interaction .",

    "if we do not include coulomb screening , the phonon linewidth is a simple product of coupling function @xmath201 with a forward scattering peak around @xmath53 and the electron polarization with a very similar momentum structure of the electron - hole continuum of 2d electron gas .",
    "depending on the peak width @xmath13 of the @xmath1-ph coupling constant @xmath52 and the peak of electron polarization at @xmath157 , we find the linewidth @xmath202 has a maximum value at @xmath53 or @xmath203 at low temperature , and the linewidth is broad at @xmath167 .",
    "even if the latter happens , since the linewidth for small @xmath11 tends to increase with temperature , the maximum may shift back to @xmath53 at high temperature .",
    "the momentum resolved phonon spectral function at @xmath204 can be understood in the same picture .",
    "the broad linewidths at @xmath167 would normally indicate an instability to a charge - ordered phase at long wavelengths .",
    "however , once the long - range coulomb interaction screens the @xmath1-ph interaction we find that the phonons are undressed . here , the anomalous broadening at @xmath167 is suppressed by the divergence in the coulomb interaction at @xmath167 while the total phonon linewidth is reduced throughout the brillioun zone . in this case ,",
    "a small peak remains at nonzero momentum transfers ; however , the magnitude of this peak is much smaller than the linewidths measured by hreels  @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the broadening of the srtio@xmath4 phonons ( with a maximum at @xmath188 point ) observed by zhang _ et al . _",
    "are not due to the forward - focused @xmath1-ph coupling inferred from the arpes measurements and are likely from some other source . to resolve the forward - focused @xmath1-ph interaction ,",
    "the hreels experiments should focus on smaller values of @xmath2 , which will be challenging given the large background signal at @xmath167 .",
