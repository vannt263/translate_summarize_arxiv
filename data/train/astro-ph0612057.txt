    "located at the ne of the molecular cloud / h ii region complex ngc  6334 , the massive cores ngc 6334 i and ngc 6334 i(n ) are separated by only 90@xmath0 and are considered `` twin '' objects in some aspects but also very different in other characteristics ( beuther et al . 2005 ) .",
    "both cores have similar dimensions : @xmath1 ( sandell 2000 ) or 0.08 pc at a distance of 1.7 kpc ( neckel 1978 ) .",
    "they also have similar masses in gas ( @xmath2200 m@xmath3 for ngc 6334 i and @xmath2400 m@xmath3 for ngc 6334 i(n ) ; sandell 2000 ) , but their bolometric luminosities are very different ( @xmath4 l@xmath3 for ngc 6334 i and @xmath5 l@xmath3 for ngc 6334 i(n ) ; sandell 2000 ) .",
    "these differences have been attributed to ngc 6334 i(n ) being less evolved than ngc 6334 i ( thorwirth et al .",
    "2003 ; hunter et al .",
    "2006 ) . with time",
    ", the forming massive stars in ngc 6334 i(n ) will reach their final masses and shine with much larger luminosity than now .",
    "there is recent observational evidence that the formation of massive stars takes place in a similar way to that of solar type objects , namely by accretion via a circumstellar disk : a handful of cases where a disk could be present around a forming massive star have been presented in the literature ( e. g. shepherd & kurtz 1999 ; patel et al . 2005 ; schreyer et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these disks are larger than those found in forming solar stars , and have dimensions of order 1000 au and masses of a few solar masses . in this paper we present 1.3 cm and 7 mm observations of the core ngc 6334 i(n ) , trying to study the environment of the massive stars that are suspected to be forming there .",
    "the 1.3 cm observations were made in the bna configuration of the vla of the nrao , during 2005 january 23 .",
    "the central frequency observed was 22.46 ghz and we integrated on - source for a total of 120 minutes .",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( with an adopted flux density of 2.52 jy ) and the phase calibrator was 1720@xmath6358 ( with a bootstrapped flux density of 0.652@xmath70.005 jy ) .",
    "the phase noise rms was about 25@xmath8 , indicating good weather conditions .",
    "the phase center of these observations was at @xmath9 .",
    "the 7 mm observations were made in the cnb configuration of the vla during 2005 june 30 .",
    "the central frequency observed was 43.34 ghz and we integrated on - source for a total of 100 minutes .",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( with an adopted flux density of 1.45 jy ) and the phase calibrator was 1720@xmath6358 ( with a bootstrapped flux density of 1.02@xmath70.01 jy ) .",
    "the phase noise rms was about 10@xmath8 , indicating excellent weather conditions .",
    "the phase center of these observations was at @xmath10 .",
    "the data were acquired and reduced using the recommended vla procedures for high frequency data , including the fast - switching mode with a cycle of 120 seconds .",
    "the effective bandwidth of the observations was 100 mhz .",
    "we made images with natural weighting to obtain the highest signal - to - noise possible .",
    "the rms noise of the 1.3 cm image is 67 @xmath11jy . at this wavelength we detected three sources , whose",
    "positions and total flux densities are given in table 1 .",
    "all three sources appear unresolved ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the first source in table 1 does not have a counterpart at other wavelengths and we refer to it as vla - k 1 ( since it was detected at 1.3 cm , the so - called k band ) .",
    "the other two sources are associated , respectively , with the sources sma 4 and sma 1 reported by hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show a contour image of these last two sources as well as the positions of other sources in the region .",
    "the rms noise of the 7 mm image is 320 @xmath11jy . at this wavelength we detected four sources , whose",
    "positions and total flux densities are given in table 2 .",
    "the first source in table 2 is associated with sma 6 , a source reported by hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in figure 2",
    "we show a contour image of this 7 mm source .",
    "the other three 7 mm sources are very close among them , forming a line that extends by @xmath2 4@xmath0 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we interpret these three sources as the subcomponents of the 1.3 mm source sma 1 , the dominant millimeter object in the region ( hunter et al .",
    "sma 1 extends by about the same extent and position angle as the three 7 mm sources .",
    "we then refer to the three 7 mm sources as sma 1a , 1b , and 1c ( see table 2 )",
    ".      of the three sources detected at 1.3 cm , only one ( sma 4 ) has an associated 3.6 cm counterpart , an unresolved source with flux density of 0.34@xmath70.06 mjy detected by carral et al .",
    "the other two sources detected at 1.3 cm do not have a 3.6 cm counterpart at the 4-@xmath13 level of @xmath20.24 mjy .",
    "the spectral index between 3.6 cm and 1.3 cm is then 0.4@xmath70.3 ( @xmath14 ) , consistent with free - free emission from a thermal jet ( reynolds 1986 ) , although an optically - thin hii region can not be ruled out .",
    "this spectral index determination is reliable since the 3.6 and 1.3 cm observations have similar angular resolution ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the other two 1.3 cm sources do not have a 3.6 cm counterpart and lower limits of @xmath20.9 are estimated for their spectral indices .",
    "again , this spectral index is consistent with the values expected for free - free emission from a thermal jet .",
    "we suggest that the compact 1.3 cm emission detected by us is probably tracing ionized jets .    of the four sources detected at 7 mm , only one ( sma 1b )",
    "has an associated 1.3 cm counterpart , an unresolved source with flux density of 0.57@xmath70.12 mjy detected by us ( see tables 1 and 2 and figure 1 ) .",
    "the spectral index of this source between 1.3 cm and 7 mm is large , 4.5@xmath70.4 , suggesting that the 7 mm emission can not be attributed to optically - thick free - free emission and is most probably arising from dust .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the other three 7 mm sources that are not detected at 1.3 cm , but show a flux density of several mjy at 7 mm .",
    "the non detection of these three sources at 1.3 cm , indicates that their spectral index between 7 mm and 1.3 cm is @xmath163.3 .",
    "we then suggest that , in contrast to the 1.3 cm emission that appears to be tracing free - free emission , the 7 mm emission is tracing dust .",
    "the 1.3 cm data has better angular resolution ( @xmath17 ) than the 7 mm data ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , we have tapered the 1.3 cm data to produce images of similar angular resolution to those at 7 mm and our results are not changed .",
    "we finally compare our 7 mm data with the 1.3 mm data of hunter et al .",
    "this comparison is not direct since our angular resolution is of order @xmath19 while that of hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is of order @xmath20 . in particular , as noted before , the source sma 1 of hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that is the dominant 1.3 mm source of the region is resolved by us into three subcomponents at 7 mm ( sma 1a , 1b , and 1c ) .",
    "the total flux density of sma 1 at 1.3 mm is 2.04 jy . in a solid angle similar to that occupied by sma 1 at 1.3 mm ,",
    "we detect a total flux density of @xmath240 mjy at 7 mm ( of which 31 mjy can be attributed to the sources sma 1a , 1b , and 1c ) .",
    "a spectral index of 2.4@xmath70.2 is derived between 7 and 1.3 mm .",
    "a similar comparison can be made for the source sma 6 , for which we estimate a total flux density of @xmath29 mjy for a solid angle similar to that occupied by sma 6 at 1.3 mm . the same spectral index , 2.4@xmath70.2 , as derived for sma 1 is obtained for sma 6 between 7 and 1.3 mm .",
    "we then suggest that at 7 and 1.3 mm we are observing optically thin dust emission with a dust mass opacity coefficient that goes with frequency as @xmath21 . with this information we can estimate the masses of the 7 mm sources . following hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we adopt a value of @xmath22 = 1.5 @xmath23 g@xmath24 ( the average of the values of 1.0 @xmath23 g@xmath24 , valid for grains with thick dust mantles , and 2.0 @xmath23 g@xmath24 , valid for grains without mantles ) .",
    "this implies @xmath25 = 0.78 @xmath23 g@xmath24 .",
    "assuming optically thin , isothermal dust emission and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 ( sodroski et al .",
    "1997 ) , the total mass of the 7 mm sources is given by :      where @xmath27 is the dust temperature and @xmath28 is the distance to the source .",
    "assuming @xmath27 = 100 k for sma 1 and @xmath27 = 33 k for sma 6 ( hunter et al .",
    "2006 ) , we derive masses on the order of a few solar masses for the four 7 mm sources ( see table 2 ) . these dust temperatures ( hunter et al .",
    "2006 ) have been estimated from molecular observations and have uncertainties of a factor of two , that reflect in the mass determination .",
    "we finally discuss the different spectral indices for the emission of the sources determined by us for the 1.3 mm to 7 mm range ( that gives a value of @xmath22.4 ) , and for the 7 mm to 1.3 cm range ( that gives a value of @xmath163.3 ) . as noted by wilner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , these changes in spectral index most probably denote grain growth to centimeter - size particles .",
    "the significant presence of centimeter - size dust grains flattens the spectral index for wavelengths shorter than the characteristic size of the grains .      the dimensions ( @xmath21000 au ) and masses ( a few @xmath29 ) of the four sources detected at 7 mm are suggestive of massive circumstellar disks .",
    "furthermore , the two 7 mm sources with deconvolved dimensions ( sma 1a and sma 1b ; see table 2 ) have orientations consistent with hosting the exciting sources of two outflows reported in the region .",
    "megeath et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected an sio outflow whose axis is oriented at position angle of @xmath2135@xmath8 and could be attributed to the source associated with sma 1a , whose major axis is oriented at a position angle of @xmath242@xmath8 , nearly perpendicular to the outflow .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) propose that an elongated infrared nebulosity could be a jet or a reddened reflection nebulosity from an outflow cavity and propose that it is excited by sma 4 .",
    "this nebulosity extends approximately to the west of the core of ngc 6334 i(n ) , with position angle of @xmath30 and could alternatively be excited by sma 1b , since this source ( as sma 4 ) also lies along the axis of the nebulosity .",
    "there is , however , a problem with the interpretation of these structures as massive circumstellar disks . in the cases of forming objects where the masses of the disk and its central star have been estimated , they usually have a ratio of order @xmath31 10 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1998 ; guilloteau & dutrey 1998 ; schreyer et al . 2006 ) .",
    "if we apply this mass ratio to the 7 mm sources in ngc 6334 i(n ) , stars with masses of tens of solar masses would be required at the center of the disks .",
    "this is clearly not the case since the modest bolometric luminosity of @xmath5 l@xmath3 ( sandell 2000 ) would then be exceeded by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath31 10 is not an established rule .",
    "for forming objects , surely the @xmath32 ratio will depend on the stage of evolution , with smaller values at the initial stages .",
    "the theoretical models of yorke , bodenheimer , & laughlin ( 1995 ) predict values of @xmath31 4 for forming intermediate - mass stars . it is known from theoretical two - dimensional calculations that forming stars with @xmath33 3 will face gravitational instabilities that will induce spiral waves ( laughlin & bodenheimer 1994 ) .",
    "however , from their global , three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations lodato & rice ( 2005 ) conclude that these massive self - gravitating disks can survive for relatively long periods .",
    "the problem of disk stability in massive stars has been recently reviewed by cesaroni et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    from the observational point of view , in some sources the possibility that @xmath32 is as low as @xmath22 is consistent with the data ( patel et al .",
    "furthermore , in the case of g192.16 - 3.82 , the protostar and disk have comparable masses of about 8 @xmath29 ( shepherd , claussen , & kurtz 2001 ) . with the finding of additional young objects that may have comparable masses in the disk and the protostar , it is important to review the issue of the stability of these structures .",
    "it is also possible that these massive disks are forming a compact stellar group , as proposed by sollins & ho ( 2005 ) for the 100 @xmath29 disk in g10.6@xmath60.4 , in which case part of the mass now observed in them will end in the smaller members of the group .    in summary",
    ", we believe that the observations discussed here are consistent with the presence in ngc 6334 i(n ) of several forming massive stars that at present have reached only a fraction of their final masses and are surrounded by disks with masses comparable to those of the stars . whether these massive structures that we identify as disks are forming a single star or a compact stellar group can not be disentangled with the present observations .",
