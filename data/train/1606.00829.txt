    "fragmentation processes are meant to describe the evolution of an object which is subject to random and repeated dislocations over time . the way the mass is spread into smaller fragments during a dislocation event is usually given by a ( random ) _ mass - partition _ , that is an element of the space @xmath0 where the total mass need not be conserved",
    ", a positive proportion @xmath1 may disintegrate into dust .",
    "the first probabilistic models of fragmentations go back at least to kolmogorov  @xcite .",
    "roughly , kolmogorov imagined a discrete branching system in which particles get fragmented according to a conservative distribution  @xmath2 on  @xmath3 and in a _ homogeneous _ manner , that is to say the rate at which a particle splits does not depend on its mass . under this essential assumption of homogeneity",
    ", kolmogorov showed that a simple rescaling of the empirical measure of the logarithms of the fragments converges with probability one toward the gaussian distribution .",
    "later , a student of his , filippov  @xcite investigated mass - dependent dislocation rates and more precisely the _ self - similar _ case , in the sense that a particle with size  @xmath4 splits at speed  @xmath5 for some fixed constant @xmath6 ( the homogeneous case then corresponds to @xmath7 ) .",
    "most notably he discovered a limit theorem for a weighted version of the empirical measure of the fragments when @xmath8 .",
    "the specific but common _ binary _ situation , where particles always split into two smaller fragments , has been emphasized by brennan and durrett  @xcite , and later reconsidered by baryshnikov and gnedin  @xcite in some variant of the car packing problem .",
    "further extensions and other asymptotic properties in the non - conservative case have also been derived by bertoin and gnedin  @xcite by means of complex analysis and contour integrals .    in",
    "the 2000s ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 1 - 3 ) for a comprehensive summary ) , bertoin extended and theorized the construction of general fragmentation processes in continuous time . in particular the _ dislocation measure _",
    "@xmath2 need no longer be a probability distribution , as there is only the integrability requirement @xmath9 while permitting infinite dislocation rates ( so infinitely many dislocation events may occur in a bounded time interval ) , this condition prevents the total mass from being immediately shattered into dust and leads to a nondegenerate fragmentation process @xmath10 with values in  @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath7 , fragmentation processes can be related ( via a simple logarithmic transformation ) to _ branching random walks _ , for which fruitful literature is available , see the works of biggins and uchiyama  @xcite . especially , _ additive martingales _",
    ", which are processes of the form @xmath11^{-1 }      \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i^q(t),\\qquad t\\ge0 ,   \\label{form}\\ ] ] for some parameter @xmath12 , play a key role and the question of their uniform integrability inquired by biggins has successfully led to the asymptotic behavior of homogeneous conservative fragmentations  @xcite . more generally , in the self - similar case , some specific so called _ malthusian hypotheses _ guarantee the existence of an intrinsic martingale associated with the fragmentation and whose convergence again yields many interesting asymptotic results . among others the results of kolmogorov and filippov have been revisited  @xcite , applying known statistics of self - similar markov processes to the process of a randomly tagged fragment .",
    "more recently , bertoin  @xcite introduced a new type of fragmentation processes in which the fragments are allowed to grow during their lifetimes .",
    "we expect that most of the aforementioned asymptotic properties extend to these _ growth - fragmentation _ processes , and it is the main purpose of the present work to derive some of them",
    ". we shall first give a bit more description and explain why our task is not completely straightforward .",
    "like in the pure ( without growth ) setting , we are interested in the process which describes the ( sizes of the ) fragments as time passes . for homogeneous growth - fragmentations , namely the _",
    "compensated fragmentations _ of  @xcite ,",
    "the basic prototype is simply a dilated homogeneous fragmentation , that is a pure homogeneous fragmentation affected by a deterministic exponential drift .",
    "however , there exist much more general compensated fragmentations , where the dislocation measure  @xmath2 has only to fulfill @xmath13 so that the process is nondegenerate and can still be encoded at any time by a non - increasing null sequence . condition   is weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition   for  @xmath2 to be the dislocation measure of a homogeneous fragmentation , and both are reminiscent of those concerning the jump intensities of lvy processes , respectively subordinators .",
    "incidentally , it was the main motivation of  @xcite to establish that , just like the lvy  it construction of lvy processes in terms of compensated poisson integrals , compensated fragmentations naturally arise as limits of suitably dilated homogeneous fragmentations ( * ? ? ? * theorem  2 ) .",
    "though asymptotic properties of pure homogeneous fragmentations immediately transfer to the dilated ones , extending them to general compensated fragmentations would correspond to interchanging two limits , which does not seem obvious at first sight .",
    "this is without to mention the self - similar case , that is for the growth - fragmentations in  @xcite , where things look even more complicated .    there , and unlike the compensated fragmentations which are constructed directly as processes in time ,",
    "the self - similar _ cell systems _ are rather built from a genealogical point of view : roughly , the ( size of the ) _ mother cell _ evolves like a markov process on the positive half - line where each negative jump  @xmath14 is interpreted as a splitting event , giving birth to a _ daughter cell _ with initial size  @xmath15 and which then grows independently of the mother particle and according to the same dynamics , producing in turn great - daughters , and so on .",
    "bertoin focused in particular on the situation where the associated growth - fragmentation process @xmath16 , that is the process recording the sizes of all alive cells in the system , fulfills a self - similarity property , namely when there exists @xmath6 such that for each @xmath17 , the process @xmath18 has the same law as  @xmath19 started from a cell whose initial size is  @xmath20 . in the homogeneous case @xmath7",
    ", these growth - fragmentations correspond to the compensated fragmentations of  @xcite for which the dislocation measure is binary , see ( * ? ? ? * proposition  3 ) . in the self - similar case @xmath21 ,",
    "they have been proved to be eventually extinct  ( * ? ? ? *",
    "corollary  3 ) , an observation which was already made by filippov  @xcite in the context of pure fragmentations .    both for homogeneous and for self - similar fragmentations ,",
    "the additive martingales   and more precisely their uniform integrability have turned out to be of greatest importance in the study of asymptotic behaviors .",
    "we stress that sufficient conditions to this uniform integrability appear less easily for growth - fragmentations , as they non longer take values in the space of mass - partitions  @xmath3 .",
    "our work is organized in two independent parts . in [ sechom ] , we deal with the homogeneous case @xmath7 in the slightly more general setting of compensated fragmentations  @xcite . with the help of a well - known theorem due to biggins  @xcite and by adapting arguments of bertoin and rouault  @xcite , we prove the uniform convergence of additive martingales from which , in the realm of branching random walks , we infer the asymptotic behavior of the largest fragment as well as precise estimates for both the empirical measure of the fragments and the presence probability of abnormally large ones .",
    "this part can be viewed as a contribution to the study of extremal statistics in certain branching random walks , see the recent developments by adkon  @xcite , adkon  @xcite , arguin  @xcite and hu  @xcite .",
    "the self - similar case is considered in [ secss ] within the framework of  @xcite .",
    "relying on recent results in  @xcite and in particular on the uniform integrability of the malthusian martingale , we establish the convergence in probability of the empirical measure of the fragments when @xmath8 and we provide some partial estimates for the largest fragment . in a concluding section",
    "we also address the convergence of another empirical measure when we stop the fragments as soon as they become smaller than a fixed threshold .",
    "recall the space of mass - partitions  @xmath3 defined in   and denote by  @xmath22 the subspace of mass - partitions @xmath23 having only one single fragment @xmath24 .",
    "a compensated fragmentation process @xmath25 is a random process whose distribution is characterized by a triple @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a diffusion coefficient , @xmath28 is a growth rate and  @xmath2 is a nontrivial measure on @xmath29 such that holds .",
    "it can be seen as the decreasing rearrangement of the exponential of the atoms of a branching process in continuous time .",
    "namely , the process giving the empirical measure of the logarithms of the fragments at time  @xmath30 , @xmath31 is called a _ branching lvy process _ in  @xcite , to which we refer for background . in the basic case where @xmath32 , the fragmentation rates are finite , @xmath33 is a generalization of the branching random walk in continuous time introduced by uchiyama  @xcite : more precisely , @xmath33 is a branching particle system in which each atom , during its lifetime , is allowed to move in  @xmath34 independently of the other atoms and according to the dynamics of a spectrally negative lvy process  @xmath35 with laplace transform    & & & & & & e[(q(t))]&=(t(q)),&&t0 ,  q0 , & &    where under   the laplace exponent @xmath36 is finite for all @xmath37 . in words , when @xmath32 , the system can be described as follows .",
    "it starts at the origin of space and time with a single particle which evolves like  @xmath35 .",
    "each particle dies after a random exponential time with intensity @xmath38 , giving birth to a random family of children @xmath39 whose initial position @xmath40 relative to the mother particle at its death is such that @xmath41 has the conditional distribution @xmath42 .    in the general situation where the dislocation rate @xmath38 may be infinite ,",
    "the construction is achieved by approximation from compensated fragmentations with finite dislocation rates , using a monotonicity argument ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) recalled in the proof of [ lgamma ] below ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath43    \\label{intensity}\\ ] ] the mean intensity of the point process  @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 is the laplace transform of  @xmath46 . an important fact ( cf .",

    "note that   also implies @xmath55 , so @xmath56 .",
    "let us introduce the subspace @xmath57 of the space  @xmath58 of @xmath59-summable sequences endowed with the distance @xmath60 .",
    "we also denote @xmath61 the space of bounded , non - increasing sequences of nonnegative real numbers endowed with the uniform norm @xmath62 .",
    "we see by   that the compensated fragmentation @xmath63 is a @xmath64-valued process for every @xmath65 , and in particular for @xmath66 .",
    "further if @xmath67 is in  @xmath68 and @xmath69},\\g z^{[2]},\\ldots$ ] are independent copies of  @xmath70 , then the process of the family @xmath71}_i(t),\\,i , j\\in\\n),\\,t\\ge0,$ ] rearranged in the non - increasing order is again in  @xmath68 , and we denote its distribution by @xmath72 .",
    "it has been proved in  @xcite that @xmath73 is a markov process which fulfills the so called _ branching property _ : for all @xmath74 , the conditional law of @xmath75 given @xmath76 is @xmath72 , where @xmath77 . without loss of generality",
    "we shall assume in the sequel that the fragmentation starts with a single mass with unit size , @xmath78 .    equation   and the branching property yield an important family of additive martingales .",
    "namely , the @xmath34-valued process @xmath79 is a martingale for every @xmath80 . as a first consequence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2 ) , the compensated fragmentation  @xmath70 possesses a cdlg version in  @xmath68 , that is a version in the skorokhod space @xmath81 of right continuous with left limits , @xmath68-valued functions .",
    "working with such a version from now on , @xmath70 has actually cdlg paths in  @xmath64 for every @xmath65 .",
