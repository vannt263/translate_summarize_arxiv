    "is the most effective network assisted algorithm to control the congestion at the routers .",
    "there are several aqm algorithms proposed in the literature viz . drop - tail , random early detection ( red ) , random early marking ( rem ) etc .",
    "red has been able to enhance the throughput by using dropping function in terms of the average queue size  @xcite .",
    "a desirable feature of the algorithm is to reduce the loss rate in the presence of random traffic characteristics .",
    "another algorithm rem introduces rate mismatch as well as queue mismatch to yield high throughput or achieve low loss - rate  @xcite .",
    "queue mismatch is the difference between target queue length and current queue length and rate mismatch is the difference between link capacity and input rate .",
    "rem differs from red since it uses a different measure for congestion and hence has a different technique for calculating the marking / dropping probability .",
    "this congestion measure or price is updated based on both mismatch observed for queue and rate .",
    "similarly , rem computes the prices for each link and then calculates their sum to determine the end - to - end marking probability . the latter probability increases with higher congestion measures or link prices  @xcite .",
    "a new algorithm blue improves the performance by reducing the loss rate of the packets by modifying the dropping function based on loss events  @xcite . a separate first - come - first - served ( fcfs ) queue is required in fairness - queuing ( fq ) scheme for each conversation .",
    "the queues are serviced in a round - robin fashion so as to allocate equal bandwidth to each queue .",
    "stochastic fairness queuing ( sfq ) is proposed to avoid infeasible computational requirements for high - speed networks  @xcite . in the case of large number of queues as compared to the number of conversations , a high probability is provided for each conversation being assigned to its own queue .",
    "the flow or pair of source and destination receives less than the allocated shared bandwidth when two conversations collide .",
    "sfq provides a mechanism so that collided conversations for one slot are very unlikely to collide during the next  @xcite .",
    "a variant of red has been proposed in  @xcite to resolve the limitations observed with traditional red  @xcite .",
    "refining red , wang et .",
    "@xcite have enhanced the throughput by keeping the average queue size below the threshold value to avoid dropping of the packets .",
    "this has been realized by first adapting the queue weight parameter and thereafter the values of the @xmath0 parameter are chosen to stabilize the queue size .",
    "a limitation with red is that packets are discarded even when the queue size is lower than the threshold value .",
    "@xcite have addressed the issue of unnecessary dropping of packets by requiring additional information on instantaneous queue size .",
    "the important aspects for the stabilization of queue in the red gateway are discussed in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a robust optimization technique for red is analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "this robust optimization technique is independent of technology , model and protocols used .",
    "a detailed comparative study of aqm algorithms can be found in  @xcite . in red ,",
    "the queue size varies according to congestion level which leads to unpredictable queuing delay .",
    "a major issue with traditional red has been the setting of the parameters and their tuning in order to achieve good performance  @xcite .",
    "adaptive red achieves significant control resulting in improved throughput using dynamic adaptation of the maximum probability @xmath1 parameter .",
    "feng et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a three - section red ( tred ) to overcome this issue particularly for heavy loads by dividing the queue size interval @xmath2 into three equal sections . in tred , dropping probability is calculated according to the dropping function used in the three different sections .",
    "nonlinear dropping functions are used in lower and upper sections of the queue size interval . in addition , the middle interval uses a linear dropping function .",
    "tred is able to improve the throughput at low - load and maintains low delays at high - load  @xcite .    the problem of parameter setting in tred is not adddressed as in red .",
    "further , adaptive red also does not show good performance under high load conditions .",
    "also , in the case of proportional controller , it is found to suffer from a limitation under certain situations in which it is infeasible to implement .",
    "the instability is found in proportional controller if an operating point of @xmath3 lies between @xmath4 and 1 for such network conditions which result in oscillations of queue length .",
    "this leads to increase in the queuing delay and this issue arises due to the coupling between the average queue size and the dropping probability .",
    "the proportional integrator ( pi ) controller has been proposed to decouple both the average queue size and the dropping probability  @xcite . the pi controller is implemented with the nonlinear tcp dynamic by introducing the role of the queue s operating point .",
    "wu et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed an interactive mobile streaming scheme which has the capability to maintain a certain level of service quality in the presence of dynamic network environments .",
    "most of the aqm schemes have been studied for wired networks .",
    "adaptive optimized proportional controller ( aopc ) is another novel aqm scheme based on controlling the queue parameter  @xcite .",
    "the dropping probability is updated for a very small time interval upon each packet arrival in aopc .",
    "aopc measures packet loss ratio for larger intervals by introducing load estimator for the network .",
    "tcp load is estimated with the help of packet loss ratio and then tcp / aopc feedback is optimized according to the second - order system model  @xcite .",
    "it makes aopc stabilize the queue length very close to the target queue length using an optimized second - order system model .",
    "chavan et .",
    "@xcite have , however , discussed the robust aqm for wireless networks where a challenging problem results from fading and the resulting change in bandwidth allocation  @xcite .",
    "chavan et .",
    "@xcite have designed a better queue controller by tuning the operating points offline .",
    "an analytical model for bursty and correlated traffic to compute performance measures such as end - to - end delay , loss probability , and throughput is also proposed in  @xcite in the presence of hybrid wireless networks .",
    "this analytical model is also applicable for bursty and correlated traffic and has been tested on omnet++ simulator .",
    "one of the serious limitations of the aformentioned algorithms is that they are based on information regarding the mean queue size alone .",
    "however , in reality the rate of change of queue size on account of non - stationary heavy traffic may provide much deeper insights into the growth dynamics of queue build up .",
    "our work aims to incorporate information both about the mean queue size at any time and its rate of change .",
    "in fact , prior work completely ignores this second - order dynamics that our work aims to capture .",
    "our work makes our system akin to a dynamical system where not just the velocity but also information on acceleration is captured through the system measurements and this new information is also used to control the system dynamics .",
    "we observe that this ( latter ) information indeed helps obtain better control over the system .",
    "this paper comprises of five sections .",
    "section ii discusses a queue rate based model which is introduced to overcome the problems observed in the existing algorithms . the simulations and discussions are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv evaluates the performance of our proposed scheme with existing schemes using ns-2 simulator . in the last section , we provide the concluding remarks",
    "a new approach which incorporates both queue size and its rate of change would better characterize the evolutionary dynamics of queue size build up .",
    "the dropping function is a key variable which affects the throughput or the loss - rate in the aqm algorithm .",
    "the dropping function in red is based on the assumption that the input traffic characteristics do not change much with time .",
    "in contrast to red , we have introduced a new parameter @xmath5 , corresponding to the rate of change of the average queue size in addition to the average queue size ( @xmath6 ) itself .",
    "the proposed aqmrd approach calculates the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath5 according to @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the average queue size and the rate of change of the average queue size respectively at time @xmath11 .",
    "we increment time by one unit so that sufficient number of packets arrive / depart during the interval .",
    "accordingly , the information about rate of change of the average queue size would reflect the traffic characteristics to achieve better congestion control at the routers .",
    "a positive value of the rate of change of @xmath6 indicates that the queue size attains the threshold rapidly whereas a negative rate of change indicates a slow - down in the process of reaching the threshold .    in order to prevent packet drop at the gateways ,",
    "our aim is to modify the dropping function so that unused buffer space remains available to accommodate the new arriving packets .",
    "this is achieved by noting that a positive value of @xmath5 results in a reduction in the number of received packets .",
    "red has been found to perform well in the case of moderate traffic .",
    "one of the deficiencies of red is that it is hard to configure and is sensitive to traffic load .",
    "our proposed algorithm is able to capture the changing nature of non - stationary traffic . in the red gateway , the average queue size",
    "is compared to two thresholds , maximum threshold and minimum threshold .",
    "however , the effect of non - stationary heavy traffic results in the increase in frequency of crossing or reaching the @xmath12 and thus resulting in more packets being dropped . in order to address this limitation ,",
    "we have modified the red algorithm by introducing a new variable , viz .",
    ", @xmath13 lying between @xmath14 and @xmath12 , which adapts to rapidly changing temporal variation of @xmath6 .",
    "the proposed extended framework results in qualitatively much improved values of the performance metrics . to avoid reduction in the number of received packets ,",
    "we have applied a more aggressive dropping function by varying @xmath13 towards @xmath14 .",
    "this allows significant reduction in the number of discarded packets and is achieved when a gateway marks the packet more aggressively before @xmath6 reaches the @xmath12 . as a negative rate of change will slow down the process of reaching @xmath12 , it will not adversely affect the dropping of the packets .",
    "however , a positive rate of change is likely to force the system to enter into an undesirable state resulting in dropping of several packets .",
    "the introduction of a @xmath13 takes care of such an adverse situation . the proposed queue - rate based model allows more unused space to be left in the buffer , thus reducing the number of times @xmath6 crosses the maximum threshold .",
    "consequently , it results in an increase in the number of received packets by dynamically updating @xmath13 depending on the value of @xmath5 .      in the light of the significant role played by @xmath5",
    ", we have proposed a new queue - rate based algorithm for the gateways .",
    "the aqmrd gateway performs different decisions for @xmath13 according to ( 3 ) . here",
    ", @xmath13 is updated as follows : @xmath15    the dropping probability function is calculated as follows :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 @xmath20 for a positive value of @xmath5 , the aqmrd gateway starts dropping packets when @xmath6 crosses the threshold @xmath13 rather than @xmath12 .",
    "the aqmrd gateway for positive @xmath5 calculates the dropping probability according to @xmath21 where @xmath13 is a variable which varies between @xmath14 and @xmath12 according to ( 3 ) . in the case of a non - positive value of @xmath5 ,",
    "the dropping probability is computed as @xmath22 +   +        * the proposed aqmrd algorithm : * +   + initialization : + @xmath23 + for each packet arrival + calculate the average queue size @xmath6 and rate of change of average queue size @xmath5 + if @xmath24 + increment @xmath25 + if @xmath26 + decrement the @xmath13 + if @xmath27 + calculate probability @xmath17 + else + calculate probability @xmath18 + calculate probability @xmath28 using @xmath17 and @xmath18 + update the dropping probability + @xmath29 mark the arriving packet with probability @xmath30 + else + increment the @xmath13 + calculate probability @xmath17 + calculate probability @xmath28 using @xmath17 + update the dropping probability + @xmath29 mark the arriving packet with probability @xmath30 + if gateway mark the arriving packet + @xmath31 + else if @xmath32 + @xmath23 +    the @xmath14 is not kept too low so that the aqmrd gateway does not underutilize the bandwidth , particularly in view of fluctuations arising on account of heavy and non - stationary traffic .",
    "depending upon the permissible delay , the threshold @xmath12 is set .",
    "if the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath14 is small then average queue size is likely to reach the maximum queue size frequently as seen in the drop - tail scheme .",
    "accordingly , to circumvent the problem , we choose @xmath13 so that it varies according to @xmath33 in case of a positive value of @xmath5 , the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 should be sufficient enough to avoid global synchronization .",
    "aqmrd s dropping function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dropfunct ] .",
    "the advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not suffer from the phenomenon of global synchronization due to the dynamic nature of @xmath13 .",
    "the advantage of aqmrd is that it achieves a better throughput for heavy traffic with the help of prior information regarding the change in average queue size and the rate of change of the same .",
    "this dynamic adaptation of @xmath13 results in an adaptive nature of queue management and which in turn results in improvement of the performance irrespective of the parameter setting .",
    "the next section presents a comparative study of our scheme with existing aqm schemes using the ns-2 network simulator .",
    "we consider the network topology as shown in fig .",
    "the gateway / router parameters used in the experiments are set as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 packets .",
    "the queue parameter @xmath14 is set at one - third of @xmath12 in each simulation to achieve good performance  @xcite .",
    "a gateway has a buffer size of 64 packets and each ftp source sends a packet with a maximum packet size of 1000-bytes until the congestion control window allows sending of the packets .    for performing simulation",
    ", we assume random propagation delay varying from 4 ms to 10 ms between the ftp sources and router .",
    "each simulation is run for a duration of 100 seconds .",
    "we choose maximum probability @xmath35 to check the efficacy of the proposed scheme with respect to the parameter setting .",
    "due to the adaptive nature of our proposed scheme as discussed later , aqmrd achieves good performance even for a high maximum probability as @xmath35 , indicating that our scheme has low sensitivity towards the @xmath0 parameter because at a low value of @xmath0 , our scheme achieves good performance .",
    "we set the delay bandwidth product at around 200 packets which equals the congestion window size  @xcite .      in our experiments , we have simulated settings with 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 ftp sources , respectively .",
    "these correspond to low , moderate , high and very high traffic load conditions . for our first set of experiments",

    "an area of future enquiry would be to optimize the values of @xmath13 and the other parameters @xmath46 etc . using a stochastic optimization approach .",
